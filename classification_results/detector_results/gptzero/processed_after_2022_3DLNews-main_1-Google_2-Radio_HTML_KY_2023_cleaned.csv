Health studies flagged cancer risks. Citizens reported contamination. Then, states started suing. On Thursday, Tennessee joined about 20 other states in suing manufacturers of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. PFAS is an umbrella term for a group of about 12,000 substances called “forever chemicals” that repel oil and water and do not break down in the environment. PFAS are used in furniture, cookware, waterproof clothing, food packaging, cosmetics, firefighting foam and toilet paper. These chemicals have been detected in our blood, air, soil, a fertilizer made from Nashville sewage and water — affecting the drinking water supply of an estimated 200 million Americans. PFAS exposure is linked to kidney cancer, high cholesterol, decreased fertility, liver damage, thyroid disease and birth defects. In the US, DuPont and 3M have historically been the largest manufacturers of PFAS, and both companies now face about 4,000 lawsuits from states and cities seeking compensation for cleanup. Last week, 3M agreed to pay $10.3 billion to about 300 communities in the largest PFAS-related settlement to date. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti is suing 20 manufacturers, including DuPont, 3M and Chemours. The lawsuit alleges that companies knew that their products, specifically firefighting foams, would harm Tennesseans and Tennessee’s natural resources. “Manufacturers continued to produce and profit from these chemicals long after they were aware of the dangers,” Skrmetti said in a press release. “We will fight to obtain serious compensation from every one of these defendants to ensure we can clean up our environment and stop the harms associated with PFAS.” The first PFAS was invented in the 1930s, and DuPont introduced it to the world with teflon in the following decade. In 1998, the Environmental Protection Agency was alerted to the health hazards of PFAS; the agency first proposed a standard to limit PFAS in drinking water this year. Today, about 30,000 companies are still using PFAS and causing pollution. More lawsuits and settlements are expected. The attorney general’s office said that the state is requesting monetary relief to stop manufacturers from continuing to pollute and hold them financially liable for remediation. It is unclear how potential settlement funds would be used in the state. “Any monies derived from this lawsuit should fund the expansion of PFAS contamination testing in Tennessee, and effective remediation programs,” Scott Banbury, a director at the Sierra Club in Tennessee, said in a statement. “What would be more meaningful is state regulations that required testing for PFAS at our landfills, wastewater treatment plants and in sewage sludge that is applied to agricultural land across the state.”'}]"

This week Rupert Murdoch officially hands over the titles chair of Fox Corp., Fox\'s broadcast arm, and News Corp., which publishes newspapers and books. My guest, Brian Stelter, is the author of the new book ""Network Of Lies: The Epic Saga Of Fox News, Donald Trump And The Battle For American Democracy."" It\'s a follow-up to Stelter\'s bestselling 2020 book about Fox called ""Hoax."" The new book is about how Fox helped spread the lie that Trump won the election. It also examines the secrets that were exposed about what Fox hosts and executives really thought about the conspiracy theories spread on Fox. Part of the book\'s focus is on Tucker Carlson, who was fired just after Fox settled with Dominion. Dominion Voting Systems was suing Fox for spreading baseless conspiracy theories alleging that Dominion rigged its voting machines so that Biden would win. Just before the trial was about to start, Fox decided to settle, presumably to prevent Dominion lawyers from exposing private communications from Fox News hosts and executives, revealing their hypocrisies. Stelter is the former chief media correspondent for CNN and hosted CNN\'s former Sunday program about the media called ""Reliable Sources."" Before that, he was a media reporter for The New York Times. He\'s now a special correspondent for Vanity Fair and host of the podcast ""Inside The Hive."" He\'s a producer on the Apple TV+ series ""The Morning Show,"" which is inspired by his first book, ""Top Of The Morning."" Brian Stelter, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Your book is really interesting, so thank you for coming back to our show. BRIAN STELTER: It\'s a great privilege. Thank you. GROSS: So this week is a big transition week from Rupert Murdoch to his son Lachlan taking over the reins. How do they compare in terms of their politics and management style and goals for Fox? STELTER: Well, Rupert Murdoch is, in his heart, a newspaper man. He believes he is a journalist. Yes, he comes at it from the right. He has certain very strongly held opinions. But he deeply cares about his newspapers and, to some degree, Fox News. His son Lachlan is, No. 1, in some ways, more conservative and, No. 2, much more business-minded. He\'s not nearly as interested in politics. He\'s not nearly as interested in the polling. He\'s a lot more interested in how much money he can rake in from campaign ad spending at his stations and on Fox News. So he comes to this as a businessman, and I suspect that means Fox is going to continue to be this beating heart of the GOP, supporting whoever becomes the nominee, most likely Trump this year. GROSS: Well, if Lachlan is focused on advertising, I mean, Tucker Carlson\'s extremism cost the network a lot of money. A lot of the sponsors pulled out. They had to rely on MyPillow (laughter) for - as a primary sponsor. STELTER: And that\'s one of the reasons why Lachlan eventually decided to cut ties with Tucker and fired him last August by canceling his show. It was a cold-hearted business calculation. And we can talk about all the reasons why it eventually happened. But I think it goes to show that Lachlan Murdoch, in the words of one source, is minimizing headaches and maximizing profits. He\'s going to do whatever the audience really wants, as long as it\'s not going to cause lots of headaches. And the thing about Tucker Carlson is he was causing a lot of headaches. GROSS: What about Lachlan\'s brother James? What\'s his relation to Fox News now and to his family? STELTER: Anyone who\'s watched ""Succession"" has a little bit of a sense of this because this is a very real drama. James is the more liberal son. He is the outcast at the moment. He is not involved at all in the family businesses. He\'s chosen to break ties from Fox and News Corp., in part because he\'s horrified by the content on Fox News. He says to his friends that it\'s poisoning America. He has a vision for what he would want Fox News to be. He would want to drag it back toward reality, back toward at least an imagined middle ground where facts and journalism were prioritized over the propaganda that currently airs. But right now, James has no ability to do that. He is - as I said, he\'s on the outside. He has a vote in the Murdoch family trust. So in the event of Rupert\'s death, James will have an opportunity to try to take over, try to team up with his sisters and take control of Fox Corporation. But for now, that\'s just in the distant horizon. For now, this is Lachlan\'s company. GROSS: I think James quit the board in 2020. STELTER: Right. He said goodbye - no more board meetings, no more grip-and-grins. But, you know, as his wife, Kathryn, once said to The New York Times, when you\'re a part of the family, it\'s never really over. GROSS: So there\'s - what? - eight votes in the trust - in the Murdoch trust? STELTER: That\'s right. There\'s eight votes. And right now, Rupert Murdoch has four of those eight, which is how he maintains control. So even though we\'re going to hear this week about his stepping aside, becoming chairman emeritus, what some of his aides call semi-retirement, I would really emphasize the word semi because Rupert is going to remain involved in various ways. GROSS: So it\'s a complex family with siblings from multiple marriages. But the siblings with votes are Lachlan, James and their two adult sisters. So where do those two sisters stand? STELTER: That\'s right, Elisabeth and half-sister Prudence. These are described as the adult children, the four adult children. There are two younger daughters who are now in college or beyond college. They are growing up, but they don\'t have voting rights. They only have financial stakes in the trust. So, you know, financially, they all benefit. But in the event of Rupert\'s death, it\'s going to be those four adult children who decide what happens to Fox Corp., what happens to News Corp., what happens to The Wall Street Journal and Fox News and all of these assets. It\'s possible they\'re going to be broken apart, sold off in pieces. It\'s possible the companies will be recombined, will come back together again the way they were a decade ago. There are all sorts of possibilities. GROSS: Yeah, what is Fox now? - \'cause Murdoch sold most of 20th Century Fox to Disney at the end of 2017 for $71 billion, and the children got, like, how many billions a piece? STELTER: Close to $2 billion each, which is why someone like James Murdoch is now off making his own investments, creating his own media company. Now, that 2 billion - that was important, you know, for Rupert to try to give stability to his children. But I also think that Disney deal is really important in retrospect, to realize Rupert sold at basically the top of the market. Listen to the conversation now, five years later, about cable assets, about broadcast, about the dying broadcast business, about streaming, the struggles to make streaming profitable. Rupert - for all of his faults, he seemed to see this coming, and he was able to sell his assets to Disney and get out of those businesses at a really prime time. Now, of course, they still have Fox News and they have Fox Sports and some other assets. But Fox News is the largest profit-driver by far. Fox News is what keeps them in their mansions and on their helicopters. GROSS: What lawsuits is Fox facing now? STELTER: Possibly the largest lawsuit is by Smartmatic. That\'s one of those voting technology companies that I had never heard of until the 2020 election; maybe you hadn\'t either. You know, these relatively obscure companies like Dominion and Smartmatic, these are the companies that help make our elections run, that provide the machines and the software to tally the votes. There were all sorts of conspiracy theories about both companies at the end of 2020. One of the claims was that they were actually the same company, when, in fact, they are not. So Dominion was able to very easily prove that the smears that aired on Fox were, in fact, lies. And a court in Delaware affirmed that earlier this year. All that stuff - it was just made up. Dominion, thus, had a lot of leverage to win a settlement and get almost $800 million out of Fox. But Smartmatic is asking for even more. Smartmatic is demanding $2.6 billion, and that case is still winding its way through the'}]"
