NEW YORK (AP) — A suspected shoplifter opened fire inside a Times Square sporting goods store after being confronted by a security guard Thursday night, hitting a tourist in the leg before fleeing into the street, according to police. As police chased the shooter a few blocks on the busy streets of Midtown, Manhattan, he fired twice at an officer, before escaping into a subway station, New York Police Department officials said. The wounded tourist, a 37-year-old woman, was expected to recover. The shooter, described by police as a male between 15 and 20 years old dressed in all white, was still at large Friday. “We are looking for one male. He is the shooter,” Chief of Patrol John Chell said at a news conference at the scene Thursday. “He shot at our cops not once but twice, and also shot an innocent female one time in the leg.” At around 7 p.m. Thursday, the shooter and others were witnessed at the store on West 42nd Street and Broadway putting items of clothing in a bag. In the lobby, the security officer confronted two members of the group, had “words with them” and took the property back, Chell said. That’s when the shooter pulled out a gun and fired at the guard, he said. But instead of hitting the employee, the bullet struck the tourist. The shooter and one of the other people with him ran off. Four blocks away on 47th Street — near a triangular Times Square pedestrian plaza where tourists line up to buy Broadway tickets and snap selfies with the area’s iconic billboards — two officers quickly spotted the pair and took the second person into custody. The shooter ran off towards 6th Avenue with one of the officers giving chase, at one point cutting between buildings. There, he turned and fired at the officer, Chell said. “Our officer draws his weapon. He cannot fire,” he said. “Too many people around, there’s too many people ducking.” The suspect fired again from under his arm and continued to flee, running into a subway station, where he was last seen. Video showed him going to the tracks and coming back, Chell said. Chell said the shooter discarded his jacket while fleeing. News footage showed police tape surrounding a white jacket and baseball cap lying in the street across from Radio City Music Hall. The shooting prompted a huge police presence and search that temporarily closed streets in the area. A reward of as much as $10,000 is being offered for information about the shooter, police said. Once one of the seediest places in New York, synonymous with pornographic theaters and sex work, Times Square experienced a revitalization in the 1990s that transformed it into one of the city’s most family-friendly destinations. On most evenings, it is packed with gawking tourists and street performers, though it also still attracts pickpockets and hustlers who take advantage of out-of-towners. Overall, crime rates have plummeted in New York City since a spike at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of people shot in the city dropped 39% between 2022 and 2023, a trend that has continued into the new year.

Washington (CNN) — Thrust into an election year that had already been defined in part by voters’ concerns over the president’s age and fitness for office, special counsel Robert Hur’s report amounted to a legal victory but a political landmine for President Joe Biden. The president’s outrage on Thursday night made that obvious. Biden’s aides know there is no topic more likely to draw their boss’ fury than a slight against his family. So it was hardly a surprise to many inside the White House when an indignant Biden emerged Thursday to forcefully rebut, among other things, a claim in Hur’s report that he had forgotten the date of his son’s death. “How in the hell dare he raise that?” Biden seethed in the Diplomatic Reception Room, where reporters had been hastily gathered for a presidential statement. His visceral anger – among the brightest public flashes to date of what aides say is a mostly private hot temper – reflected a sentiment that had been boiling inside the White House for several days, since the president’s lawyers first received a copy of the report Hur prepared following his investigation into Biden’s handling of classified documents. Behind the scenes, Biden’s aides fumed at a portrait they said was wholly unfair and, more importantly, nothing close to the person they say they interact with every day. Nearly to a person, Biden’s aides use words like “sharp” and “tireless” when describing their boss, particularly when he is dealing with foreign conflicts or world leaders. They recount lengthy meetings in the middle of the night, whirlwind round-the-world foreign travel and hour-long rope-lines to illustrate a man they claim hasn’t lost a beat. Democratic Rep. Daniel Goldman of New York, who spoke by phone with Biden a day ahead of his October 8 interview with Hur, said the president was “sharper than anyone I’ve spoken to” about the situation in the Middle East, which at the time was unraveling. “His mastery and command of a complicated geopolitical situation was just impeccable,” Goldman said, adding he couldn’t know what occurred in Biden’s interview with Hur. “I don’t know what happened in there.” As details of the public report were emerging, Biden grew livid at some of the details included in the final version about his recollection of date and details. In a private meeting with Democrats in Virginia on Thursday afternoon, Biden cursed when venting his anger. In the meeting, Biden asked how anyone could believe he would forget the day his son died, using profanity to punctuate his fury, according to people familiar with his comments. “How would I f******” forget that,” Biden said, according to one of the people. People in the room interpreted the forceful response as a sign of just how upset the report had made the president. Biden’s outrage exploded into public view Thursday evening, as the president derided the allegations about his memory as “extraneous commentary” and claimed Hur and his team “don’t know what they’re talking about.” “It has no place in this report,” Biden said before batting away questions from reporters about his fitness for office. “My memory is fine,” he insisted. Moments later, as he was responding to a question about the crisis in Gaza, Biden mistakenly referenced Mexico when he meant Egypt – precisely the type of slip-up his rivals seize upon to question his mental acuity, and a clear indication that the concerns about Biden’s fitness won’t be dispelled by a single, fiery news conference. Hur – a former Trump Justice Department official – declined to bring charges and made a point of saying Biden’s handling of classified documents compared favorably to Donald Trump’s. Yet the words Biden’s lawyers used when describing Hur’s document were scathing: “inappropriate,” “inaccurate,” “wrong,” “extraneous,” “unfounded” and “irrelevant.” The source of their ire: Multiple depictions of Biden as forgetful, unable to remember some of the most important dates of his life or the contours of a decade-old policy debate. In a phrase that appears destined to factor heavily in the coming campaign, Hur said Biden presented himself in an interview as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” Biden’s defenders leapt to defend him, saying the depictions were inaccurate, over the top and even ageist. And the president said Hur got at least some of that description right. “I am well-meaning. And I’m an elderly man,” he said. “And I know what the hell I’m doing. I’ve been president – I put this country back on its feet. I don’t need his recommendation.” Still, if Hur’s claims about Biden’s memory had occurred in a vacuum, separated from what Americans were already seeing and hearing, they would perhaps have appeared less credible. But because they arrived at a moment when American voters were already reckoning with the president’s age and mental fitness – and, in polls, expressing deep concerns about both – the words only buttressed what will be Biden’s biggest political challenge over the coming nine months. On Thursday, however, Biden summarily dismissed concerns about his age – even those shown in public polling – ascribing instead the worries to the media. “That is your judgment. That is your judgment,” he told CNN’s MJ Lee, raising his voice. In public, however, Biden can at moments appear forgetful, as he did this week when he verbally transposed the names of former (and deceased) foreign leaders with present-day ones. In those episodes, Biden was describing an international summit in 2021 when he recalled speaking with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who died in 2017, and French President Francois Mitterrand, who died in 1996. There are other signs of his age as well. He has slowed noticeably, with a stiff gait his doctor has ascribed to previous injuries. And he clears his throat so often – a symptom of reflux, according to the physician – that he sometimes has to explain himself, as he did at a fundraiser this week when he said he had swallowed a cough drop. Only about 45 minutes before Hur’s report was released publicly, the White House was working to downplay the verbal slip-ups, saying it’s common for people to misspeak. “Many people, elected officials … they can misspeak sometimes,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, citing recent examples from House Speaker Mike Johnson and TV host Sean Hannity. She said in meetings she’s attended with Biden, she had never witnessed him confuse people’s names. There is little that irritates Biden or White House officials more than public questioning of the president’s age and acuity, making Thursday’s report a wellspring for frustrations and forceful pushback. One official told CNN that they viewed some of the criticism outlined in the lengthy report as “way out of line” and “just wrong.” White House officials were particularly aggrieved by allegations in the report about Biden having memory and recall problems during his multi-hour sit-down with Hur in October, including about Beau Biden’s death. This official said that as the multi-hour interview got underway in the fall, Hurt acknowledged to the president that he would be asking about some things from a long time ago and prompted Biden to recall things to the best of his ability – and thanked Biden for doing the interview in the middle of a serious international crisis. “Of course, he was understandably distracted and managing a crisis in Israel and the Middle East,” the official said. “To now retrospectively go back and suggest it is indicative of some bigger issue with memory is wrong. It’s just wrong.” Perhaps the biggest objection among White House officials was a reference in the report that says Biden “did not remember, even within several years, when his son Beau died.” “He remembers the day Beau died every day of his life,” this official said. “To suggest otherwise is insulting.” As the Biden campaign pivots to general election mode, senior campaign officials insist that the best remedy for concerns related to the president’s age is for voters to see him – out and about and campaigning – as much as possible. There has already been a notable uptick in traditional retail politics stops for Biden in the new year – drop-bys at diners and small businesses where he is meeting voters and working the room. Ahead of the report’s release, the biggest concern among Biden’s aides was that Republicans would seize on its findings about documents found in the president’s home and conflate them with the far more significant legal risks facing Trump for his own handling of classified material. As it turned out, the report delineated clearly between the two cases, pointing to “several material distinctions between Mr. Trump’s case and Mr. Biden’s.” Instead, it was the questions of mental acuity that were immediately glaring to Biden aides and lawyers who viewed the report ahead of its public release. A strategy of embracing the legal findings while forcefully challenging the “irrelevant critical commentary” had been taking shape in private for'}]"

He replaces Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. Here are some facts about Syrskyi, already a key Ukrainian figure throughout Russia’s full-scale invasion. EARLY YEARS Syrskyi was born in July 1965 in Russia’s Vladimir region, which was then part of the Soviet Union. He has lived in Ukraine since the 1980s. Like many people of his age in Ukraine’s armed forces, he studied in Moscow – at the Higher Military Command School – among peers who have since become Russian commanders, graduating in 1986 and serving for five years in the Soviet Artillery Corps. Some military analysts believe his battlefield tactics reflect his hierarchical Soviet training. THE SNOW LEOPARD Syrskyi became head of Ukraine’s land forces in 2019. He had previously commanded Ukrainian troops fighting a Moscow-backed insurgency in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that began in 2014, and was given the call sign “Snow leopard”. BIGGEST VICTORIES Some of Ukraine’s biggest victories of Russia’s full-scale invasion were overseen by Syrskyi. He led the successful defence of the capital Kyiv in the early months and was named a Hero of Ukraine, the country’s highest honour, in April 2022. In July 2022, Syrskyi planned and executed a lightning counteroffensive that pushed Russian troops away from the city of Kharkiv and retook swathes of land to the east and southeast. BAKHMUT Early last year, Syrskyi led Ukraine’s defence of the eastern city of Bakhmut, where thousands of soldiers on both sides were killed in one of the bloodiest battles of the war so far. Some military analysts questioned whether fighting for a ruined city was worth so many dead and wounded. Syrskyi said Ukraine’s dogged defence of Bakhmut had damaged Russia’s overall war effort by tying down the Wagner mercenary group. TROOP MORALE Syrskyi says his priority is the morale of his troops, whom he is regularly pictured visiting at the front. He has told Western media that he sleeps four-and-a-half hours a night and relaxes by going to the gym. Syrskyi is married and has two sons.

Lanning remembers it like it was yesterday. “And as I proceeded to get closer to the accident scene I noticed the buggy in pieces, I noticed the deceased horse laying down in the ditch, which those kids absolutely loved that horse,” said Lanning. Court documents claim Samantha Petersen was high on meth when she got behind wheel before slamming into a horse-drawn buggy carrying four Amish children, two sisters losing their lives in the crash. — RELATED: FCSO warrants: Woman accused of driving car in fatal buggy crash may have swapped places with sister — Law enforcement says the months following the crash was critical in getting justice. “It’s important for us to wait for these things before we start these legal proceedings because if we were going to make an arrest right away because we think we know what happened, that starts this court process. If this were to go to trial before we had all this evidence back, we risk losing this case,” said Fillmore County Sheriff John DeGeorge. According to court documents Sarah Petersen, Samantaha’s identical twin sister, tried to take the fall for the events on that September day. “Our deputies started an investigation and later it was determined through search warrants interviews and analysis of different data that Samantha, Sarah’s twin sister, was driving that vehicle,” said Sheriff DeGeorge. Now both sisters facing a long list of charges for allegedly causing that deadly accident. And according to law enforcement for all the lies that have been telling since. — RELATED Charges: Driver in deadly Amish buggy crash was on meth, had her twin sister take the fall — “Justice will finally be served hopefully. I honestly hope they throw the book at these girls because what they did is just despicable. And even their actions afterward just show you what type of people these girls are,” said Lanning. Justice this quiet community has been waiting for since that sunny day turned dark. Samantha Petersen is scheduled to make her court appearance on March 25 and her sister Sarah on April 1.
