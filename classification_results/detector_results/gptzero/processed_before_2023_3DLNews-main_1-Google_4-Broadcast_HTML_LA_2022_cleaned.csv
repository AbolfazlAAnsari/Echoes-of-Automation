The president was in the East Room of the White House for a meeting of his Competition Council, which is focused on changing regulations and enforcing laws to help consumers deal with high prices. Reporters in the room shouted a number of questions after Biden’s remarks. WARNING: The following video contains uncensored profanity. Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked Biden about inflation, which is at a nearly 40-year high and has hurt the president’s public approval. Doocy’s network has been relentlessly critical of Biden. Doocy called out, “Do you think inflation is a political liability ahead of the midterms?” Biden responded with sarcasm, “It’s a great asset — more inflation.” Then he shook his head and added, “What a stupid son of a b----.” The president’s comments were captured on video and by the microphone in front of him. Doocy laughed it off in a subsequent appearance on his network, joking, “Nobody has fact-checked him yet and said it’s not true.” Doocy told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that Biden called him later to the clear the air. Doocy said Biden told him, “It’s nothing personal, pal.” The White House did not immediately responded to a request for comment. The White House has insisted repeatedly that it is focused on curbing inflation, with Biden reorienting his entire economic agenda around the issue. But the president has also shown a willingness to challenge a media that he deems to be too critical, especially Fox News and Doocy. At his news conference last week, Biden said to Doocy with sarcasm, “You always ask me the nicest questions.” “I have a whole binder full,” the reporter answered. “I know you do,” Biden said. “None of them make a lot of sense to me.

(WIAT) – His candle burned at both ends. Lee, his younger sister, said that even as a child, John Jay Runnion was the life of the party. “He went and went and went,” she said. And for more than five decades, John made a run of it. Born in Ohio, he’d graduated high school in Kentucky, graduated college in Colorado and successfully begun a career in Tennessee. He’d eventually moved to Birmingham and settled down with his family: a wife and three boys. But that was the old John, his sister said. The new John had been different. In 2018, two weeks before Christmas, John Jay Runnion – the old John, the new John – the only John his sister had ever known – was found dead on a picnic table in Avondale Park, his sleeping bag zipped up to his shoulders, according to a coroner’s report. The low temperature the night before John’s death was 25 degrees. John was not alone. John Jay Runnion was one of at least four men facing homelessness in Jefferson County who died over the last decade following exposure to the cold. From the start, John Runnion was a firecracker. “If there was a party within ten miles, John was in the middle of it,” his sister Lee said. “He was everybody’s friend.” John was born in 1957 to an upper-middle class family in Van Wert, Ohio. Before John had started school, the family moved to Iowa, where his father worked as a general manager for the Angus Journal, a cattle magazine. By the time John had reached the third grade, his parents’ relationship had broken down, ending in divorce. The break-up changed the family dynamic. “Back then, it was awful being a divorced woman in a small town,” Lee explained. “Divorce back then carried a stigma.” So when John and Lee’s elder sister married and moved with her husband to Henderson, Kentucky, the family followed. John and Lee would finish their high school years there, graduating from Henderson High School in 1975. Both siblings, too, would head to Colorado for college: Lee at Metropolitan State College and John at the University of Colorado. There, at UC, John wanted to play football, but his size got in the way. “He was too small,” his sister said. “So he decided the next best thing to do to be ‘in the party’ was to be a cheerleader.” He loved the gig, his sister said: “By the end, he was on a first-name basis with the president of the university.” Soon, after graduating with a degree in business administration, John was climbing the ladder in Memphis, Tennessee, at the Trammell Crow Company, a major real estate firm. “I know how to work,” John wrote in an ad for the company not long after he’d moved to Memphis. “I am committed to make things happen.” John’s career took off. He became the youngest partner in Trammell Crow history. When he made partner, Lee said, John transferred from Memphis to Birmingham, where he settled down. Then, John and Lee’s mother died. She’d starved herself to death, Lee said. “She got to the point where she couldn’t eat anything because she said everything was bad for her,” Lee explained. “And pretty soon she couldn’t eat anything at all.” Lee, who had stayed in Colorado and pursued a career as an accountant, said she remembers visiting Birmingham to see John and his family in 1998 following their mother’s death. She remembers visiting Sloss Furnace. She remembers the good food. She remembers a happy family. “When we were there, my three nephews started down on us,” she said. “They wanted a tree house.” And they got it. “We spent almost the whole two weeks we were with them building a tree house in their backyard,” she said. However, Lee said that over time, things began to change for John. The old John was fading. The new John was coming to the fore. Lee takes a moment to reflect as she remembers the change. “It hurts so bad that part of you wants to block it out,” she explains. John abandoned his family – his wife and three kids – according to his sister. “He wouldn’t give her a divorce, and he abandoned them,” she said. She learned that John’s business partner had bought him out. The family had sold the house. At one point, John had been sleeping in a rental house in a sleeping bag, she’d heard, unable to accept the circumstances he’d found himself in. In 2016, Lee flew John out to Colorado after their father’s death. She remembers him being subdued during the trip, but “not like he became.” Gradually, John began living on the streets. “Church people would talk him into living with them, and he’d do that for a while,” Lee said. But eventually – seemingly inevitably – John would end up back on the street. Tucker Runnion was 10 years old when his father disappeared. “It seemed pretty instantaneous,” Tucker said. “It was like one day he was him, and the next day he was gone.” Today, Tucker is 27 years old and works as a construction supervisor. Of his siblings, Tucker said he’s the only one who really kept in touch with John after he left. Every once in a while, he’d get coffee with his dad. “It was never about him,” Tucker said of the meetings. “He wanted to make it about me.” John would ask for updates about his son’s life – about the moments he was missing every day. “He always assured me that everything was fine and that his spirit never died,” Tucker said. “He was always enthusiastic and joyful.” Tucker said John’s philosophy had always been clear – work hard, play hard.

(KPEL News) - A new pharmaceutical contract being pushed by the Edwards administration may force state employees and retirees to find a new pharmacy, starting Monday. The contract, which takes effect on January 1, will go forward after a legal challenge from independent pharmacists, who say the new contract will financially impact independent pharmacies around the state. According to them, as well as Democrats and Republicans in the legislation, Attorney General Jeff Landry, and others, the new contract will cause them to lose their state employees/retirees as clients. The reason for the concern is what they are saying are inadequate reimbursement rates in the new contract. That contract, worth $2 billion, is between the Office of Group Benefits (OGB) and CVS Caremark. According to OGB, users will not have to use a CVS pharmacy, but any pharmacy that is opted into the Caremark network. You can check to see if your pharmacy is in that network by going to the Caremark site and logging in or creating an account. However, critics say the new reimbursement rates will force smaller, independent pharmacies to opt-out, and will create ""pharmacy deserts"" in rural parts of the state, where bigger, chain pharmacies are rarely found. Landry\'s office intervened in the case, offering a warning to what it could mean for users. State Senator Heather Cloud of District 28 has been urging Louisiana citizens to get their prescriptions filled before the new year in case the change affects their local pharmacy. With the judge’s decision coming just days before the new year, over 200,000 state employees/retirees will have just three days to get in contact with their pharmacies to see if their pharmacy will be opting out of the contract or not. For the pharmacies that are opting out, their state-employee customers will likely have to find a new big-box pharmacy to fill their prescriptions and get their vaccines from. District 28 State Senator Heather Cloud is recommending state employees fill their prescriptions by Jan. 1 to avoid any troubles come the beginning of the new year.'}]"
