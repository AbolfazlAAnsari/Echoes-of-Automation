While our favorite television series don\'t always cover the more serious issues that afflict our society, that doesn\'t mean that they don\'t live through those moments just as we did as viewers. For example, a show like The Andy Griffith Show wouldn\'t try to cover something as serious as a presidential assassination for a multitude of reasons. Part of what made the show appealing is that it existed in such an idyllic universe, the kind of place we wanted to live instead of our reality. However, its actors and creators, while they played their characters well, were not immune to the trials and tribulations of reality. Karen Knotts\'s book, Tied Up in Knotts: My Dad and Me, mainly discusses her father, Don Knotts\', life and experiences, including his experience on The Andy Griffith Show. With the amount of time spent on the set of The Andy Griffith Show, it makes perfect sense that sometimes, when events happened, the cast and crew had the opportunity to experience them together. One such event described in Knotts\'s book was when the news that President Kennedy had been shot in Dallas, reached the public while they were on set working on a new episode. Jackie Joseph, best known for playing Ramona Ankrum in the series, explained that before the news broke, the cast and crew were laughing during the read-through of an episode. Jackie stated, ""I\'m just sitting in the room with them; it was such a tickle, and they enjoyed the read-through just like they were enjoying watching a show. You know, they were just laughing, getting a kick out of each other. I mean it continued; it went on and on. They were enjoying it while doing it. And nobody laughed at Don more than Andy. He was just hysterical."" Then, suddenly, the mood changed. Joseph explained, ""And then the awful news came that President Kennedy had been shot. One of the assistants in the office came in and, you know, just such a pall came over the room. Everybody was stunned."" See More Andy GriffithThe Andy Griffith Show According to Andy Griffith, he was not like Andy Taylor The decision was made to cut rehearsal short, and the cast and crew returned to continue work after a hard weekend of keeping their eyes glued to the television set, with rapt attention to any news broadcasts and updates. Still, while the mood was mournful when they returned to the set to shoot, it seemed that the actors were aware of the power that the series had to brighten spirits. No one knew this better than Don Knotts himself, who, despite all the sadness, was able to make others laugh that day. Joseph said, ""Everybody was so professional and Don got everybody laughing, just by acting, by just doing his part."" One of television\'s most warmly remembered comedies, \'The Andy Griffith Show\' follows a small town sheriff and his bumbling but well-meaning deputy. It may be quiet and relatively crime free in Mayberry, and its sheriff\'s demeanor may appear easygoing, but Andy Taylor is always on the case. The warm stories and subtle humor of this universally adored television classic continue to charm and captivate audiences more than 50 years after its original airing. Match all the unique animated toy tiles in MAYberry version of the ever so popular Mahjongg matching game. Race the clock to try and match as many toys tiles as fast as you can!'}]"

RELATED: Spokane Sheriff’s deputies shoot, kill assault suspect in North Spokane home According to SIIR, the suspect became upset over the neighbors lights that were shining into his residence. The suspect was not cooperative with 911 while on the phone and told the operator that he threatened the neighbor, but no weapons were involved. After speaking with the victim, deputies established probable cause to secure a search warrant to enter the suspects residence. Using a PA system, deputies and a crisis negotiator were able to contact the suspect before eventually losing all communication. A County Patrol K9 was called to the scene to assist. According to SIIR, after gaining entry inside the home the suspect was swinging a double-bladed ax from the threshold of the door directly at the deputies on the porch. A deputy was able to move out of the way as the suspect began swinging the ax again. According to SIIR, the suspect was shot due to an immediate lethal threat to their lives. Because of the suspects actions, the K9 became involved and was subsequently injured. The K9, a two-year old Belgian Malinois, was transported to a veterinary clinic and received treatment. The K9 should make a full recovery. The was recovered at the residence along with the baton used in the threats to the neighbor. The Spokane County Sheriff's Office identified the four names of the deputies involved in the shooting as Deputy Hunter Ballou, Deputy Matthew Costello, Deputy Travis Moser and Deputy Parker Perry. The identity of the deceased will be released by the Spokane County Medical Examiner's Officer. More information will be released at a further time. COPYRIGHT 2024 BY KXLY. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

""I know we\'re not the only neighborhood dealing with the impact, but this is the most extreme example,"" said Nat Stratton-Clarke, owner of vegetarian eatery Cafe Flora. The restaurant sits down the block from Martin Luther King Jr. Way and E. Madison St. where most of the construction is centered, but even then they\'re seeing fewer customers, especially at night. ""People are steering clear of Madison, they\'re steering clear of the small businesses,"" said Stratton-Clarke, adding that 11 businesses in the area have closed because of construction which is more than closed during the pandemic. ""As their businesses were literally surrounded by construction you could barely see how to access them how do you even get in the front door."" An extensive project for King Country Metro, the $130 million Madison RapidRide G line will connect downtown Seattle to Madison Valley in minutes. But to get to the finish line, the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) says they needed to make additional street improvements on E. Madison St., which meant more construction. Earlier this year, SDOT announced the project was in its final year, but store owners like Sally Brock of the jewelry store Fancy say they\'re barely hanging on. ""I do get a lot of customers who vent about this construction as soon as they walk in the door,"" said Brock adding that she\'s thankful for the customers who do come but wonders how many turn around and go home. Same with The Music Factory\'s Ari Joshua, who says recovery after three years will be hard. ""They shut down the street they shut down the sidewalk there\'s nowhere for people to park,"" said Joshua. In a letter to city officials from the Madison Valley Merchants Association, the group is calling for more equitable solutions in the future. ""I think we need to look at that multi-billion budget and say how can we support those small businesses whether that\'s through financial help whether that\'s help through marketing,"" said Stratton-Clarke. In a statement to KING 5 about the project, SDOT said: ""For the RapidRide G project, we\'ve made adjustments based on requests from local businesses including the Madison Valley area. For example, we scheduled the last section of paving in the intersection of Madison and Martin Luther King Jr Way to keep it open during weekends. We typically schedule major intersection work for weekends due to higher commuter volumes on weekdays, but weekend access was more important to the businesses. We also were able to pause sidewalk construction in front of businesses until after the holiday season. When it comes to solutions from the city, KING 5 also reached out to Seattle City Council member Joy Hollingsworth and has not heard back. ""They are planning to do the same thing to Eastlake. Let us be the lesson, I don\'t want this to happen to another neighborhood,"" Stratton-Clarke said. Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings.'}]"
