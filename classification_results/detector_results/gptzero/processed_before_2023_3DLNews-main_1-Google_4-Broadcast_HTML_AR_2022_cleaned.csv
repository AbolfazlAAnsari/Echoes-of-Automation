The incident happened Tuesday when three inmates here at the detention center overdosed on what they suspect was fentanyl – a synthetic drug much stronger than heroin. Of the three men who overdosed, two of them needed four doses of Narcan each to be revived and a third man needed five doses of Narcan. Fayetteville health officer Dr. Marti Sharkey said that’s an extreme amount of Narcan, usually only used in a near-death situation. All three men survived the experience and were treated at Johnson Regional Hospital before being released and returned to the detention center where they remain. Now, a full-scale investigation is underway as to how the men got the drug, but police suspect another inmate smuggled it in. Deputy Sheriff Burnett also believes that charges will be filed once the investigation is complete. 40/29 News reached out to the Johnson County Prosecutor's Office this afternoon but we have not heard back. This news comes less than a week after Johnson County Sheriff Jimmy Stephens was arrested in Crawford County in an unrelated incident. Stephens admitted during a traffic stop that he was carrying marijuana, marijuana butter and oxycodone.
