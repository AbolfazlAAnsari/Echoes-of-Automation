The Association of American Medical Colleges projects a shortage of 124,000 physicians by 2034. Spotlight on America has been investigating the reasons America doesn’t have enough doctors, the states that are hardest hit, and what\'s being done to make things better. Seeing a doctor when you need one is something most of us depend on, but just finding a primary care physician who’s taking new patients can be tough these days. And getting an appointment to see a specialist often takes several months of waiting. Training to become a doctor requires four years of medical school, followed by a residency of three to seven years, depending on the specialty area. A residency provides additional training for young doctors to work directly with patients and more senior physicians. It\'s a required step to achieve medical licensure in the U.S. and the ability to work independently as a physician. The AAMC points to a cap on the number of federally-funded residency positions as a major factor impacting the shortage. Dr. Heather DeReus is one of those young physicians in training. She wanted to be a doctor for as long as she can remember. A video she shared with Spotlight on America shows DeReus at age 3 getting her very first doctor’s kit at Christmas. DeReus is now a second-year resident in pediatrics at the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville. “I love taking care of my patients. I love talking to the families.

It was believed the U.S. had a sufficient number of physicians at the time, but that was nearly 30 years ago. Since then, the U.S. population has been growing and aging. Add to that physician burnout, which worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Plus, more doctors are nearing retirement, with one out of four over age 65. That all adds up to America getting a case of a supply-and-demand crisis we’re facing today. “I think we should be very worried. Our health depends on having enough physicians and we don’t have enough,” the AAMC’s Dill said. According to a study by the National Institutes of Health, the five states expected to have the worst doctor shortages by 2030, based on demand versus the number of doctors, are: The impact of the doctor shortage is already being felt by patients. Delays in getting care are already common across the country. When it comes to urgent care, according to the AAMC, a quarter to a third of people seeking same-day care can’t get it. Affordability used to be the number one reason, but that has changed. “Now, the number one reason is they can\'t find a provider,” Dill said. Sen. John Boozman, R-Arkansas, is pushing to lift the federal cap on residency positions. He’s co-sponsoring a bipartisan bill, called the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act of 2023, to help expand the nation’s physician workforce. The legislation would add 14,000 Medicare-funded slots over the next 7 years. A National Institutes of Health review found the cost Medicare pays to train residents varies widely, based on location and specialty, with payments ranging from $63,000 to $155,000 per person. Medicare pays about $16 billion a year for residency positions nationwide, but hospitals and states also contribute, and they\'ve been paying an increasing share in recent years. “If you\'re sick, it doesn\'t matter if you\'re a Democrat or Republican,” Boozman said. “I think we\'re at the point now where people are realizing that we have to do something about this.” Congress did begin to chip away at the problem in 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It passed legislation to fund 1,200 more positions, which are being added over the next few years. But Boozman says more are needed to “combat the looming health care crisis.”'}]"

(KLKN) – Over 100 state employees turned out to the Capitol on Thursday to show support for remote work in Nebraska. It comes after Gov. Jim Pillen issued an executive order sending state workers back to the office. The Nebraska Association of Public Employees filed a demand to bargain in late November and has now renewed that demand. Since Pillen’s announcement, NAPE has surveyed over 1,700 state employees. Nearly 800 of them said they’re considering looking for a new employer, and almost 600 more said they’re actively looking for or have already applied for a new job. “The data confirmed our fears, which are that this will really affect all Nebraskans,” Executive Director Justin Hubly said. “We could end up even more short staffed than we already are, which would affect the public.” Hubly said remote work is critical to retaining the current workforce. He said union members are “passionate about providing services” to Nebraskans. Hubly said by bargaining, the union can reach contract language that benefits its members, the public and the state. “At the end of the day, there’s a legal right to bargain this, so that’s something we have to uphold,” he said.

to a new Gallup survey. Only 28% of Americans tell Gallup they’re satisfied with the amount of immigration. And the dissatisfaction is mostly driven by those who want less immigration, not more. Gallup says the overall unhappiness with the level of immigration hasn’t been this high since 2012. And the amount of people saying they are dissatisfied because they want less immigration, 40%, hasn’t been that high since 2016. Among the 63% saying they are dissatisfied, 15% say they want the level of immigration to stay the same, and 8% want to see more immigration. Lydia Saad, director of U.S. Social Research at Gallup, said this year’s poll shows a continuation of the mounting concerns Americans have had about Immigration since 2021. Nearly 40% of people said two years ago that they were satisfied with the level of immigration. Since then, the share of people who are unhappy about immigration and want less of it has doubled. “What was interesting this year is that Republicans’ dissatisfaction kind of leveled off where it was last year, with about 7 in 10 Republicans saying they're dissatisfied and want immigration decreased,” Saad said. “Whereas we saw a continued increase among Democrats holding that position. That went from only 2% in 2021 to 11% in 2022, and now it's 19%.” Saad said the “stew of issues that make up the current crisis” at the border apparently has more Democrats seeing immigration as a problem. Still, a majority of Democrats, 52%, remain satisfied with the level of immigration (40%) or want it increased (12%). Ernesto Castaneda, director of the Immigration Lab at American University, said people responding to this survey were likely influenced by what he said are misleading border encounter numbers, paired with regular images of crowds of asylum-seekers and headline-grabbing stories of migrants being bused from the border to northern cities. “Public opinion is not created in a vacuum,” Castaneda said via email. “It reflects debates in the media and does not necessarily reflect reality.” Castaneda said the surge in border encounters has been exaggerated. Government data shows around 450,000 encounters in 2020 before rising to 1.7 million in 2021 and 2.3 million in 2022. But Castaneda said those figures count individual migrants multiple times as they repeatedly try for entry during Title 42, a policy used to turn migrants away to stop the spread of COVID-19. “While the encounter numbers have been widely reported across media outlets, regardless of their perceived political orientation, encounters are different from distinct individuals,” he said. When people don’t have legal avenues to migrate for work, education, or family renunciation, the process will look more chaotic with bottlenecks at the southern border, Castaneda said. He contends that those encounter numbers will drop when Title 42 ends. Title 42’s future remains up in the air. The Supreme Court was preparing to hear arguments in the coming weeks from states concerned about an influx of migrants that they say would follow the repeal of Title 42. But the case was removed Thursday from the court’s argument calendar. President Joe Biden has said he plans to let Title 42 expire in May. Immigration is one of about 20 topics that Gallup includes in its annual Mood of the Nation survey. Immigration is the area Republicans are least satisfied with, while it’s more of a middle-of-the-pack concern for Democrats and independents. Older people are also increasingly likely to want less immigration, the survey showed. Fifty-five percent of people 55 and older who are unhappy about immigration want to see less of it, up from just 21% saying the same two years ago. There has also been an increase in that sentiment among people 35 to 54, up to 40% from 23%. Just 16% of people ages 18 to 34 who are dissatisfied want to see a decrease in immigration.""}]"
