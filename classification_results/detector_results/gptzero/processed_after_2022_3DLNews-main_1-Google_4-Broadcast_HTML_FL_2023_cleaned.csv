Party\'s Freedom Summit made swift business of Donald Trump merchandise on Saturday, selling everything from socks to bathtub rubber ducks that paid tribute to the former president. Vendor Peter Crotty also had Ron DeSantis T-shirts. But he reduced those items from their original $25 down to $5, an 80% discount on the Florida governor\'s name. The excess inventory needed to go, Crotty said. It was just one sign of DeSantis\' challenges in the 2024 Republican primary fight. Barely two months from the first nominating ballots being cast, Trump is flaunting his advantages by trying to embarrass the governor in the two rivals\' shared home state, where party activists on Saturday cheered any mention of the former president and booed at any criticisms of the GOP 2024 front-runner. ""We\'re going to win the Florida primary for the third straight time, and we\'re going to win the state by a landslide next November,"" Trump told a boisterous crowd Saturday evening, before calling to the stage several Florida lawmakers who switched their endorsements from DeSantis ahead of Saturday\'s Florida Freedom Summit. Trump and his newest backers stood beneath graphics that read: ""Florida is Trump Country."" It was a show of strength for Trump in a state where DeSantis has controlled state politics since garnering Trump\'s endorsement in 2018 on his way to winning the first of two gubernatorial elections. Now, two months before the first balloting in the 2024 presidential nomination process, the two men have an increasingly personal and crude rivalry, and the second-term governor faces the reality that Trump has dominated national Republican politics since he launched his first White House bid in 2015, when DeSantis was a little-known Florida congressman. Trump was more than a half-hour into a stemwinding speech Saturday before he mentioned DeSantis, and he did so by ticking through polling results suggesting his wide national lead among Republican voters. Trump later said, in a mocking tone, that DeSantis begged for his backing in 2018: ""I endorsed him and he became a rocket ship in 24 hours. ... Now he\'s like a wounded falling bird from the sky."" DeSantis sidestepped the former president altogether while on stage Saturday afternoon, instead sticking with his argument that his results in Tallahassee prove his conservative mettle. ""Florida has shown the way forward for the Republican Party,"" DeSantis told the crowd, drawing applause for a litany of conservative policy victories in the state. ""No state has done more to beat the left at the institutional level than we have in the state of Florida."" DeSantis, Trump and other candidates signed qualifying paperwork Saturday for Florida\'s March 2024 primary. The primary could prove critical, but only if the governor or other candidates can diminish Trump\'s strength in the early nominating states that come before. ""Weakening DeSantis\' standing in Florida is a clear objective of the Trump campaign,"" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who worked on the 2016 presidential campaign of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. ""His entire message is built on the idea that he is a terrific governor. When Republican officials in Florida are choosing Trump over DeSantis, it really weakens the core of DeSantis\' pitch."" Trump\'s campaign first announced the new slate of Florida endorsements hours before DeSantis took the stage. Trump already had secured support from a majority of Florida\'s U.S. House delegation. The latest flips, first reported by The Messenger, came two days after U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, DeSantis\' predecessor as governor, announced his support for Trump, and when Scott reaffirmed his choice Saturday, Florida Republicans roared. ""You might have seen that I endorsed President Trump,"" Scott said with a smile, pausing for the sustained ovation. ""I don\'t think there\'s any question in my mind. He is the one person running that can really bring strength back to our country."" Scott never mentioned DeSantis. Another 2024 candidate, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, drew boos when he said Trump is wrong for the country and his party. He alluded to Trump\'s multiple pending indictments. The former president also is set to testify Monday in New York as part of a civil fraud trial in which Trump is accused of deceiving banks and insurers by exaggerating his wealth on his annual financial statements. ""Go back to New Jersey!"" some activists yelled at Christie. Unbowed, he chided his fellow Republicans: ""Your anger against the truth is reprehensible."" Off stage, DeSantis downplayed Trump\'s latest show of Florida support. ""This happens in these things,"" he told reporters, flanked by top legislative leaders, Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez and several sheriffs. ""We\'ve had flips the other way in other states. It\'s a dynamic thing. Politicians do what they\'re going to do."" This coming week, DeSantis will join several candidates in Miami for the third Republican debate. Trump will skip, again, and hold a competing event in the nearby suburb of Hialeah. DeSantis was initially expected to be Trump\'s top rival after winning reelection as governor by a huge margin last November. But DeSantis has struggled since he launched his campaign in May and is a distant second now. A Des Moines Register poll published Monday finds him tied in Iowa with Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who served as U.N. ambassador under Trump. Both stood at 16%, 27 percentage points behind the former president. Trump has for months ripped DeSantis as disloyal for running against him and did so again Saturday. The Trump campaign also has mocked DeSantis\' laugh and interactions with voters. DeSantis has pointed to Trump\'s gaffes and suggested that Trump no longer has the same energy he once did. Trump\'s allies have boosted headlines suggesting DeSantis wears lifts in his boots. DeSantis told Newsmax that if ""Donald Trump can summon the balls to show up to the debate, I\'ll wear a boot on my head."" DeSantis\' super political action committee then began selling a set of golf balls with the inscription, ""Ron DeSantis has a pair."" Responded Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung: ""Ron DeSantis is so broke he needs to sell his balls to strangers in order (to) make rent and keep the lights on."" The governor told reporters Saturday that he ""just responded to their nonsense."" He dismissed ""trivialities"" of the campaign as less important than the issues at stake. ""We\'ve got a job to do,"" he said. ""We have a country that we have to fight for."" The campaign references to male anatomy are reminiscent of another Floridian\'s presidential bid against Trump. Rubio in 2016 joked about Trump\'s ""small hands"" in response to Trump\'s personal attacks. Rubio dropped out of the race after losing Florida\'s primary. State party members gave Trump a symbolic win in September, when they voted against requiring Florida primary candidates to pledge to support the eventual nominee in order to run next March. Trump has refused to take a similar pledge required for candidates to participate in national GOP debates.___ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

Matthew Perry died from the acute effects of the anesthetic ketamine, according to the results of an autopsy on the 54-year-old ""Friends"" actor released Friday. The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner said in the autopsy report that Perry also drowned in ""the heated end of his pool,"" but that it was a secondary factor in his Oct. 28 death, deemed an accident. People close to Perry told investigators that he was undergoing ketamine infusion therapy, an experimental treatment used to treat depression and anxiety. But the coroner said the levels of ketamine in Perry\'s body were in the range used for general anesthesia during surgery, and that his last treatment 1 1/2 weeks earlier wouldn\'t explain those levels. The drug is typically metabolized in a matter of hours. The report says coronary artery disease and buprenorphine, which is used to treat opioid use disorder, also contributed. The amount of ketamine detected ""would be enough to make him lose consciousness and lose his posture and his ability to keep himself above the water,"" said Dr. Andrew Stolbach, a medical toxicologist with Johns Hopkins Medicine who reviewed the autopsy report at the request of The Associated Press. ""Using sedative drugs in a pool or hot tub, especially when you\'re alone, is extremely risky and, sadly, here it\'s fatal,"" said Stolbach, who noted that both ketamine and buprenorphine can be used safely. Perry was declared dead after being found unresponsive at his home in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles. Investigators performed the autopsy the following day. The actor had taken drugs in the past but had been ""reportedly clean for 19 months,"" according to the report. Perry had played pickleball earlier in the day, the report says, and his assistant, who lives with him, found him face down in the pool after returning from errands. The assistant told investigators Perry had not been sick, had not made any health complaints, and had not shown evidence of recent alcohol or drug use. Postmortem blood tests showed ""high levels"" of ketamine in his system, which could have raised his blood pressure and heart rate and dulled his impulse to breathe. Buprenorphine, commonly used in opioid addiction and found found in therapeutic levels in Perry\'s blood, could have contributed to the breathing problem, the autopsy said. It comes in a pill or film that dissolves under the tongue. The report said his coronary artery disease would have made him more susceptible to the drugs\' effects. Perry was open about discussing his struggles with addiction dating back to his time on ""Friends"" in the 1990s. ""I loved everything about the show but I was struggling with my addictions which only added to my sense of shame,"" he wrote in his 2022 memoir. ""I had a secret and no one could know."" A woman whose name is redacted in the autopsy report told investigators that Perry had been in good spirits when she spoke to him a few days earlier, but had been taking testosterone shots which she said were making him ""angry and mean."" She said he had quit smoking two weeks earlier. The woman said he had been receiving the ketamine infusions for his mental health, and that his doctor had been giving them to him less often because he had been feeling well. Ketamine is a powerful anesthetic approved by U.S. health regulators for use during surgery, but in the past decade it has emerged as an experimental treatment for a range of psychiatric and hard-to-treat conditions, including depression, anxiety and chronic pain. While not approved by regulators, doctors are free to prescribe drugs these alternate uses if they think their patients could benefit, and hundreds of clinics across the U.S. offer ketamine infusions and other formulations for various health conditions. ___ AP Medical Writer Carla K.

It needs to Live A Salt Life. What was mentioned was Hurricane Ian. The female saltwater turtle was one year old, and Ian hit here one year ago. It’s easy to imagine Ian’s winds and water sweeping the animal off the beach as a dollar-coin sized hatchling, then the retreating storm surge dropped off Little Leonardo at the pond to find a tiny recreational vehicle to call home. Marine sea turtles need seawater, physiologically, to survive. After hatching, they head to the ocean and drink saltwater. This helps activate their specialized salt glands, which aid in excreting excess salt, maintaining ion and a water balance vital for their health. So how did our federally endangered baby green turtle adapt for 12 months to a freshwater pond, and grow far larger than an adult’s hand while there? I have no clue. It was the wrong type of water, the quality of the region’s water was horrible all winter long from 2022-23, and the reports found red tide offshore fouling the oceans and blue-green algae clogging and stinking up freshwater lakes and ponds throughout the region. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles would be proud. And word is that the steroid-looking, ripped-and-mean turtle mascot at the University of Maryland is intimidated by our greenie, who must have decided a RV Park pond was great for a summer 2023 staycation. Or the turtle spent all year Breaking Bad in an RV. I could flipper around these jokes around all night. I’m swimming in water-quality humor. Maybe our little turtle met the Geico gecko and they just had a Summer of Love. Dumb jokes, sure, but I’ll take the opportunity to make them because other than cute sea turtle stories, this summer's environmental news has been killer - deaths from heat, wildfires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes - so much tragedy that my son said to me last night: “Dad, how come all I ever see on the news anymore are dead bodies?” I was at a loss for fatherly words of solace so I just gave him a long, silent hug. Then I said: “Did you hear the one about the sea turtle who lived near some vans down by the pond … “ RED TIDE The red tide organism, Karenia brevis, was observed at background concentrations in two Southwest Florida samples collected over the past week. Other samples collected statewide by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission did not contain K. brevis The organism was observed at background concentrations in two samples off of Sarasota County. That’s it. No reports of fish kills suspected to be related to red tide were received over the past week. No reports of respiratory irritation suspected to be related to red tide were reported in Florida over the past week. No animals died of red tide toxins this week, according to the Clinic for the Rehabilitation of Wildlife on Sanibel Island, which is still rebuilding from the ravages of Hurricane Ian last year. BLUE-GREEN ALGAE There were 39 reported site visits in the past seven days with 39 samples collected. Algal bloom conditions were observed by samplers at four of the sites, none in Southwest Florida. Satellite imagery of the Caloosahatchee River watershed shows no visible bloom potential, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Satellite imagery of Lake Okeechobee shows low to moderate bloom potential on approximately 20% of the lake, primarily in the western half. The FDEP says it is important to remember the blue-green algae potential is subject to change due to rapidly changing environmental conditions or satellite inconsistencies. But for now, and for another week, it looks as if we have skirted a complete outbreak of blue-green algae on the Caloosahatchee River – but there are still several more warm weeks so there is nothing for certain yet. What is red tide? Red tide is one type of harmful algal bloom caused by high concentrations of the toxic dinoflagellate K. brevis, which is a type of microscopic algae found in the Gulf of Mexico. Red tide typically forms naturally offshore, commonly in late summer or early fall, and is carried into coastal waters by winds and currents. Once inshore, these opportunistic organisms can use nearshore nutrient sources to fuel their growth. Blooms typically last into winter or spring, but in some cases, can endure for more than one year. Is red tide harmful? K. brevis produces potent neurotoxins (brevetoxins) that can be harmful to the health of both wildlife and people. Wind and wave action can break open K. brevis cells and release toxins into the air. This is why you should monitor conditions and stay away from beaches where red tide is in bloom. People in coastal areas can experience varying degrees of eye, nose and throat irritation during a red tide bloom. Some individuals with chronic respiratory conditions like asthma or chronic lung disease might experience more severe symptoms. Red tide toxins can also affect the central nervous system of fish and other marine life, which can lead to fish kills. What causes red tide? A red tide bloom develops naturally, but recent studies have discovered mankind's infusion of other nutrients into the mix can make the red tide last longer or get stronger. But biology (the organisms), chemistry (natural or man-made nutrients for growth) and physics (concentrating and transport mechanisms) interact to produce the algal bloom. No one factor causes the development of a red tide bloom. What is blue-green algae? Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are a group of organisms that can live in freshwater, saltwater or brackish water. Large concentrations, called blooms, can change the water color to blue, green, brown, orange or red. Some cyanobacterial blooms can look like foam, scum, or mats on the surface of freshwater lakes and ponds. As algae in a cyanobacterial bloom die, the water may smell bad Is blue-green algae harmful? Different types of blue-green algal bloom species can look different and have different impacts. However, regardless of species, many types of blue-green algae can produce toxins that can make you or your pets sick if swallowed or possibly cause skin and eye irritation. The Florida department of Environmental Protection advises staying out of water where algae is visibly present as specks or mats or where water is discolored. Pets or livestock should not come into contact with algal bloom-impacted water or with algal bloom material or fish on the shoreline. If they do, wash the animals immediately. What causes blue-green algae? Blue-green algae blooms occur when the algae that are normally present grow in numbers more than normal. Within a few days, a bloom can cause clear water to become cloudy. Winds tend to push some floating blooms to the shore where they become more noticeable. Cyanobacterial blooms can form in warm, slow-moving waters that are rich in nutrients. Blooms can occur at any time, but most often occur in late summer or early fall.

The executive vice chancellor of the Florida College System, Clifford Humphrey, confirmed that the mandatory “intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity” surveys were being suspended for 2023 and will be distributed again in the spring. Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida lawmakers ordered annual surveys of nearly 2 million students, faculty and staff across 12 universities and 28 colleges statewide as part of a new law in 2021, amid concerns about what they worried was anti-conservative sentiment on college and university campuses. The law that DeSantis signed in 2021 ordered the Board of Governors, which oversees universities, and the Board of Education, which oversees colleges, “to annually assess intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity at certain institutions,” and said results must be published by Sept. 1 of each year, starting last year. Asked the reason for suspending the surveys this year, the Florida College System noted a law passed last year that pushed back the annual deadline for reporting results of the surveys from Sept. 1 to Dec. 31, starting next year. But the newer law didn’t explicitly allow agencies to skip a year and the new deadlines don’t take effect until next year. The legislation’s sponsor, Rep. Spencer Roach, R-North Fort Myers, said through an aide he was not aware the 2023 survey had been suspended. Roach’s aide said administering the surveys later in the year starting in 2024 would give students more time to form an opinion about their experiences and increase the value of the surveys. In the inaugural round of surveys, most faculty, instructional staff and administrators who responded described themselves as moderate politically – and more of them described themselves as conservative than liberal. Hardly anyone agreed that endorsing a particular political view would help them be promoted or granted tenure, and more of them agreed than disagreed that their campus was equally tolerant of liberal and conservative ideas and beliefs. The Republican-backed law in 2021 requiring the annual political surveys in college classrooms was one of the early steps to prevent what DeSantis has described as efforts to “indoctrinate” students at public universities. Since then, the Legislature has passed laws restricting certain topics from being taught in general education courses, outlawed spending money on most campus diversity programs and set up new reviews for professors whose tenure otherwise would protect them from political interference or retribution. The president of the labor union representing professors at colleges and universities, J. Andrew Gothard of the United Faculty of Florida, said he wasn’t surprised to hear the survey had been suspended. He said that was further evidence that higher education officials in Florida think the survey was inappropriate in its current form. The survey was intended to intimidate staff and faculty from holding or communicating political opinions that may be at odds with DeSantis, said Gothard, who is on leave from Florida Atlantic University to run the professors’ union. “That’s North Korea, not north Florida,” he said. The union openly discouraged professors from filling out the first year’s surveys. There is no legal requirement for students or state employees to participate. The surveys, to be completed online, did not ask participants to identify themselves. Owen Girard, a student at Florida State and president of the conservative group Turning Point USA’s chapter there, said the surveys were an effort to normalize political conversations at universities. He said most college campuses are liberal-leaning, which can cause conservative students like him to shy away from sharing their beliefs. Girard said he faced obstacles at Tallahassee Community College and described the environment at Florida State as better at allowing him to express his conservative views – but said there is still room to improve. Results from the first year’s surveys did not go as expected for conservatives. So few students filled out the surveys – fewer than 1% of more than 1.7 million – that the answers the state collected from them were statistically insignificant. Nearly 10% of almost 120,000 faculty, instructional staff and administrators responded. The lack of student participation in the first year’s round of surveys was blamed partly on bad timing: Those surveys were sent during the end of the semester when many harried students were studying for final exams. At Florida A&M University, for example, only 53 students out of 8,393 filled out the surveys. At Florida International University, only 413 out of 49,477 completed them. The first survey under the law asked students whether they felt their university campus and classes provide an environment for free expression of ideas, opinions or beliefs. It also asked whether their instructors used class time to speak about their political beliefs non-objectively and if they felt comfortable giving their views on controversial and non-controversial topics. Other questions asked students whether they believed their college or instructors were generally more liberal or conservative. A lengthier, 24-question version for faculty and staff asked whether respondents agreed or disagreed with the statements, “I have felt intimidated to share my ideas or political opinions because they were different from those of my colleagues,” and “My institution is equally tolerant and welcoming of both liberal and conservative ideas and beliefs.” It also asked professors, “Where would you place yourself on the following scale: conservative, moderate, liberal, none of the above.” It did not ask that question to students but asked them whether they perceived their professors were conservative or liberal. Faculty across the state sued in federal court to challenge the survey on constitutional grounds, but a judge dismissed the lawsuit for a lack of legal standing. The judge ruled that while professors had legitimate concerns, there was not enough evidence to support their argument that the law would have a chilling effect or subjective fear of punishment if students or faculty held beliefs unpopular with the governor. The lead plaintiff in that case, Professor Emeritus William A. Link at the University of Florida, said he retired in August 2022 amid a series of laws that he said politicized higher education. He said he felt obligated to challenge the surveys in the courtroom. “I felt a sort of obligation to do so, considering how insidious it would have on the morale and the well-being of the university,” he said. “It’s a nefarious attempt on one of the core principles of modern higher education. You keep the politicians out.” Link said his younger colleagues don’t have the freedom to retire as he did. “I’m old enough to be able to get out of it,” he said, “but many of my colleagues that don’t have a choice to do another job must remain in this kind of oppressive environment – demoralizing environment.” ___ This story was produced by Fresh Take Florida, a news service of the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications.

This would be homegrown state jobs for contractors and construction workers, transportation of goods and services within to the state where we could be using those to then allocate those resources to these projects, I mean, the list kind of goes on.” She encourages concerned Floridians to speak to their representatives. “There’s so much funding and so many opportunities that we’ll be seeing come to this state over the next five years – and, just really making them aware this is our federal tax dollars at work coming back to us – if we don’t accept these funds they will go elsewhere, they will go to other states.” WMNF reached out to the Florida Department of Transportation and is still awaiting a response.

Christmas Eve, the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said. And it all started as an argument over Christmas presents before the teens pulled out guns, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said. The 14-year-old was not happy with the amount of presents his 15-year-old brother was getting from their mom. The argument continued to Grandma’s house, where the sister’s kids were going to stay while she went to work. Once at the home, the 14-year-old reportedly pulled out a gun and pointed it at his brother, threatening to shoot him in the head. Gualtieri said an uncle at the home separated the teens and took the 14-year-old outside. Also outside was their sister, 23-year-old Abrielle Baldwin, holding her 11-month-old baby in a carrier. At some point, the sister told the teens to essentially “chill out,” according to Gualtieri. Instead of doing that, the 14-year-old shot her in the chest, “tearing up her insides,” the sheriff said. Her baby was not hurt because the child was in the carrier. Right after the 14-year-old shot Abrielle, sending her crumpling to the ground, the 15-year-old also pulled out a gun and shot his brother in the stomach. Abrielle was rushed to the hospital where she died. The 14-year-old was taken for treatment at the hospital and survived. He remains in the hospital as he recovers but is in custody, the sheriff’s office said. After the shooting, the 15-year-old ran away, discarding the gun and going to a relative’s house in Clearwater. He was later arrested and taken to a juvenile detention center. Gualtieri said both teens were known to carry guns at all times due to recent crimes in the Ridgecrest area.

Ron DeSantis (R) is leading an “assault on free expression in Florida.” “On the extreme side of the ledger, Florida is setting an agenda of unprecedented censorship, rigging the system to favor the speech of those in power and silencing dissenting voices,” said PEN America, a watchdog focused on free expression. “The assault on free expression in Florida is almost without peer in recent U.S. history.” The group pointed to Florida’s Stop W.O.K.E. Act, which restricted teaching about race and gender in schools and businesses, and the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which restricted instruction about sexual orientation in the classroom. Earlier this year, an LGBTQ advocacy group based in St. Petersburg, Fla., warned that Florida “may not be a safe place to visit or take up residence” in a travel advisory. That came in the wake of laws passed in the Sunshine State targeting the LGBTQ community, access to reproductive health care and the loosening of gun restrictions. “Taken in their totality, Florida’s slate of laws and policies targeting basic freedoms and rights pose a serious risk to the health and safety of those traveling to the state,” Equality Florida’s advisory states. PEN America has been a leading voice in the push against book bans in public schools and libraries, which often target books that delve into questions of race, gender and sex. “In examining the state’s recent policy efforts, it can seem that the solution to every problem identified by Florida policy-makers and its governor, Ron DeSantis, is to suppress speech. But not always,” the group wrote. “Importantly, Florida’s speech-related efforts seem designed to protect and enhance the speech of those who hold political power in the state, while simultaneously inhibiting the speech of those who would criticize them or their conduct in office.” The Hill has reached out to DeSantis’s campaign and office for comment.

Will it be considered convenient enough for the masses that it can survive and make a profit...or not? https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2023/09/19/brightline-service-from-miami-to-orlando-starts-soon-here-are-5-things-you-need-to-know/ We\'ll talk about the results of a new survey which claims more people are at their happiest when they reach the age of 70. I\'m not sure I agree with that, and I\'ll want to know at what age you were happier than at any other time in your life! https://studyfinds.org/what-age-peak-happiness/ It\'s hard to imagine the flood of illegal immigrants coming across our wide open southern border could get any worse than it\'s been under the Biden administration, but that\'s exactly what is happening as I write this blog! Some 4,000 illegals have come into the U.S. today alone! Who are these people, where are they from, and how did so many arrive at our border at the same time?! I\'ll have the answers, and we\'ll talk about the solutions to this national nightmare! https://nypost.com/2023/09/18/cartels-sending-migrant-mobs-to-overwhelm-the-us-border/ https://twitter.com/RepDonaldsPress/status/1704567127804461360?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet Hey, I just read that the circus is coming to Orlando after a 6 year absence!

'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'PHOENIX (AP) — Speaker Kevin McCarthy suggested Sunday that an impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden was becoming more likely, calling it “a natural step forward” as Congress soon ends its summer break and House Republicans seek to expand their investigative powers. McCarthy, R-Calif., has so far avoided committing to an impeachment vote or offering a timeline for possible action. Some House Republicans are eager to go after Biden over claims of financial misconduct involving his son Hunter, but the Democratic president has not been shown to have done anything wrong. Meanwhile, McCarthy said passing a short-term spending bill to keep the government running past the end of September would ensure that investigations of Hunter Biden could continue, a pitch directed at conservatives worried a bipartisan deal with Senate Democrats would not cut enough spending. The stopgap measure would buy time to work out a longer-term budget deal before mandatory spending cuts that neither party prefers are imposed in the new year. “If you look at all the information we have been able to gather so far, it is a natural step forward that you would have to go to an impeachment inquiry,” McCarthy told Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” An impeachment inquiry, he said, “provides Congress the apex of legal power to get all the information they need.” McCarthy is walking a tightrope as he faces pressure from members of his party looking to demonstrate support for Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential campaign. But the speaker also risks imperiling the GOP’s fragile House majority. Even if Biden were to be impeached in the House, he is unlikely to be removed from office by the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. With the House set to return to work in mid-September, the Oct. 1 start of the next budget year is fast approaching and a spending deal would be needed to avoid a partial federal closure. “If we shut down, all the government shuts it down, investigation and everything else. It hurts the American public,” McCarthy said. Conservatives, including many from the House Freedom Caucus, are usually loath to get behind short-term funding measures as they push for steeper spending cuts, using the threat of a shutdown as leverage. In June, a small group of conservatives brought the House to a standstill to protest McCarthy’s leadership. All sides had agreed to budget levels during the recent debt ceiling negotiations when Biden and McCarthy struck a deal that established topline spending levels. But McCarthy’s GOP majority rejects those amounts. A stopgap spending bill would improve McCarthy’s negotiating position with the White House and Senate Democrats, the speaker said. “We’re in this discussion together,” he said. “And so we have got to have a stronger hand.” ___ AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report.

(WECT/Gray News) - Officials in North Carolina are warning visitors about a series of Portuguese man o’ war sightings and stings as thousands flock to the state’s beaches for the summer season. Oak Island Water Rescue Chief Pete Grendze said at least six people, including four children, have recently been stung by the jellyfish-looking creatures within the past week. “We have had numerous jellyfish stings in the last couple of days and, in fact, walking the beach today in a 100-yard span I saw five of them up on the beach,” Grendze said. Grendze says the man o’ wars tend to migrate to the area in the summer once the water warms up. He said he’s been stung before by them and described the pain as a constant burning sensation. “It’s like a rope burn that keeps burning, so it’s nasty until you take care of it,” Grendze said. “Then, they usually clear up pretty quickly. Sometimes, they will last several days so you have to keep rinsing the area with fresh water for two to three days afterward.” The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warns that man o’ wars can still sting you weeks after they wash up on shore. Emergency response teams in Oak Island have placed purple flags along the beach to indicate the presence of potentially-dangerous marine life near the shore. Oak Island does not have lifeguards on duty along the beach. Grendze said anyone who comes across a man o’ war should try to stay away from it. “Cover it up if you can,” he said. “Cover it up with sand because that way somebody else won’t accidentally step on it. Leave it alone. You’re not going to get it back in the water. Once they hit land, they’re dead, they’re done. If you do get stung, the best thing they want you to do is to flush the area. If you have vinegar, that’s the best because it neutralizes the toxin.” Grendze said he still believes the best way to deal with a sting is to avoid the man o’ wars and not get stung in the first place. “Just leave them alone because even though they look dead on the ground, their tentacles can still be full of venom,” he said. “So, just watch out, the tentacles could be 2 feet to 3 feet long and you won’t even see them.” Oak Island posts updated beach conditions on the town website.
