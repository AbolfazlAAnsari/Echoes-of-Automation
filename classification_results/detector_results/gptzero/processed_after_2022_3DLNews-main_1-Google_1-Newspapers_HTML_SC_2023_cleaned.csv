lived in the same neighborhood near downtown Greenville where streets were once lined with abandoned houses and vacant lots. She said it still felt like home, a place where everyone knew each other and looked out for one another. When the city of Greenville decided to demolish dilapidated properties to clear the way for new affordable housing, Gambrell remembers feeling hopeful ""they would rebuild the neighborhood but keep the spirit."" Her wish didn’t come true. Gambrell’s small gray house now sits among well-maintained two-story houses with playfully colorful doors that were built with the help of public money. But almost none of Gambrell’s old neighbors are benefiting. Most of them — renters who didn’t have enough money to buy one of the new houses — have long since moved away, she said. City officials don’t know where they went or what became of their lives because they didn’t keep track. The city of Greenville helped developers put up nearly 60 homes in the Green Avenue neighborhood between 2007 and 2016 without ensuring people who lived there for years could remain in the neighborhood. The Green Avenue neighborhood, also known as Washington Heights, is considered by some residents and community activists as an example of the continued displacement of Black people in Greenville. Washington Heights, which is in the Green Avenue neighborhood, was a redevelopment project organized by the city\'s community development office and built out by local home builders Quinn & Satterfield Builders. “My mother lived to be 97,” said Gambrell, 74, who was raised in the neighborhood. “She wanted (the neighborhood) to change, but I don’t think she would like this.” For more than 30 years, Greenville city leaders have used taxpayer subsidies to turn decaying houses and buildings west of downtown into one of the most sought-after places to live in the city. The effort has transformed a once-declining textile town into a regional economic and cultural powerhouse that attracts thousands of newcomers every year. But an investigation by The Greenville News found the city\'s spending has also played a role in the displacement of Black residents from the Green Avenue neighborhood and other historically Black neighborhoods. From 2000 to 2020 — a span that includes the transformation of Washington Heights — the number of Black people living in the district dropped nearly 70%, according to an analysis of Census data compiled by Furman University. At the same time, the white population jumped more than 200%. Read the full Furman University study: An exploration of historic and current population shifts in the city of Greenville and surrounding Greenville County What happened in Washington Heights aligns with 20th century history in the U.S. when ""slum"" clearance, road building and other government-backed urban-renewal projects altered Black neighborhoods and uprooted people from their homes, researchers and community activists said. Derek Hyra, a professor of public administration and policy at American University, said it appears Greenville and other cities have failed to learn lessons from the past. Decades after urban renewal, they keep financing projects that are expanding downtown development into or near Black neighborhoods without building enough affordable housing to allow existing residents to stay. ""This is the new urban renewal,"" Hyra said. ""It is putting pressure on African Americans. It is putting incredible pressure on real estate."" Washington Heights once stood as a destination for working and middle-class Black families. Located just a 10-minute walk from what is now Fluor Field, a minor league baseball stadium for the Class A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, the streets were home to bustling shops and a hospital in the 1940s. Decades of decline led to rampant poverty and crime. By the time city officials and residents devised the plan to build new affordable housing, more than half the people in the neighborhood eligible to work had dropped out of the labor force, according to a city report. Most adults lacked a high school diploma. Greenville administrators devised a plan to demolish more than 70 structures. They said they wanted to build and rehabilitate dozens of other properties that would become affordable homes and rental units. “The plan is sensitive to the neighborhood’s identity while minimizing displacement,” says a city report called the “Green Avenue Revitalization Strategy.” Velma Gooch said the city did not keep its promises. Gooch, 89, has lived in the neighborhood off and on since 1949. She said she and other residents met with city officials to help clean up boarded-up houses and stop drug dealing. Instead, she said, many Black residents were priced out and now nearly all of the new neighbors are white. “When I asked (a city administrator) why there’re no Blacks, they didn’t have an answer,” Gooch said. In written responses to questions submitted by The News, a spokesman for Greenville Mayor Knox White, former newspaperman Bill Fox, said the city did not keep track of how its program impacted existing residents. He did not answer whether the city’s effort led to racial demographic changes in the Green Avenue neighborhood. The spokesman said developer Rick Quinn was one of several homebuilders who worked with the city to build 57 homes in the neighborhood. Quinn said he built houses in Washington Heights that he considered affordable, but the prices remained out of reach for some people living there at that time. Sometimes building new affordable housing in Greenville unintentionally provides an opening for gentrification, he said. “Affordable housing can be its own worst enemy,” Quinn said. Since 2013, home prices have almost tripled. One Quinn & Satterfield three-bedroom house that sold for $150,000 is now estimated at $430,000. A two-bedroom that sold in 2015 for $99,000 is now estimated at $285,000. The city of Greenville’s transformation of Washington Heights allowed some homebuyers to exploit a loophole, said Ken Kolb, a Furman University sociology professor who lives in the neighborhood. Kolb and his team from Furman produced the research on gentrification in Greenville that is the basis for The News\' ""The Cost of Unity"" project. Kolb said some people bought lots for as little as $5,000. He said he and some others paid $15,000 for a lot because their incomes exceeded the city’s median household income. Kolb bought his home in 2014. Instead of building a life in Washington Heights, Kolb said, some newcomers stayed in their homes a couple of years and then rented them. Others bought homes and then quickly sold their houses when prices started to rise, he said. Median household income by race for Census Tract 5, which most closely aligns with the Green Avenue, Greater Sullivan, and Sterling neighborhoods, 2000 - 2019. Data for white households is unavailable for 2020-2021, so data for those years is not shown. Homeownership programs subsidized by other cities often require buyers to occupy their homes for a set number of years and prohibit renting them. The restrictive covenant deeds for property in Washington Heights forbid owners from putting a fence in the front yard and parking cars on their lawns but include no residency requirement, Kolb said. “It’s like less a place to live than a place for people to invest,” he said. “You don’t want your street to be seen as an investment opportunity.

Ramaswamy, who has scored third in some GOP primary national polls, has set himself apart from other 2024 candidates as the son of Indian immigrants who’s founded multi-billion dollar companies, written several books and is hitting the campaign trail with no political experience. But Ramaswamy’s stances on certain issues, such as racial justice and the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, have drawn scrutiny among his rivals, and even some voters. During a campaign event in Iowa last week, for example, Ramaswamy called Juneteenth a ""useless"" holiday, even though he posted a video less than two months ago honoring it, as NBC News first reported. Juneteenth recognizes and celebrates the day that Black Americans were emancipated from slavery. Likewise, after former President Donald Trump\'s recent indictment on his alleged push to overturn the 2020 election, Ramaswamy targeted federal officials, a common reaction among Trump\'s Republican allies. Here’s a closer look at some of Ramaswamy’s recent remarks on the campaign trail and how he\'s echoing calls from the GOP\'s right flank. Ramaswamy told USA TODAY last month that racial minorities are often led into embracing “victimhood,” and he has repeatedly championed meritocracy and hard work on the campaign trail. He has maintained that viewpoint when it comes to Juneteenth. In a social media post shared on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, less than two months ago, Ramaswamy said Juneteenth was the celebration of how far the nation has come and how people can advance through hard work and dedication. ""We don’t just look back and flog ourselves,” he said. In a town hall last month, however, he said that he didn\'t think Juneteenth should be a national holiday. During a campaign event in Iowa, Ramaswamy went further and said that Juneteenth was ""useless"" and suggested canceling the holiday, NBC News reported. 2024 GOP candidate Will Hurd, one of Ramaswamy\'s rivals, criticized Ramaswamy for saying he ""hopes to cancel a holiday that celebrates equality and freedom,"" according to the outlet. ""His gimmicks and shtick aren’t serious,"" Hurd said. After Trump was arraigned last week in a federal courthouse, Ramaswamy said during an event in New Hampshire he would fire everyone in the government who was involved with Trump\'s prosecution. And Ramaswamy previously said he would shut down the FBI and replace it with a similar institution, a move experts warn could create chaos. “I think the FBI as an institution should not exist,” Ramaswamy told USA TODAY. “I think that that is far more practical than it sounds…I do not believe that an institution that entrenched in its culture and way of operating can be reformed."" Ramaswamy\'s recent comments came after he suggested on multiple occasions that Trump\'s indictments are politically motivated. There is no evidence that federal or state officials handling cases against Trump have sought to target his reelection bid. Ramaswamy has also appeared to dodge harsher criticism of Trump on the campaign trail. Trump was charged last week with a conspiracy to obstruct a congressional proceeding on Jan. 6, 2021, as the results of the 2020 election were to be certified. On the same day Trump was indicted, Ramaswamy was asked whether he would have certified the election results like former Vice President Mike Pence did, a question that Ramaswamy did not answer directly, according to Politico. ""I would have never let it get to that point,” Ramaswamy told the outlet. “I would have never put myself — or been part of an administration, if I was in a serious position of leadership — to ever have allowed us to have gotten to that doorstep.” He again said ""we would have never been in that position"" when asked whether he would have sought to stop Trump\'s alleged efforts to steal the 2020 election, Politico reported. Ramaswamy previously told USA TODAY that censorship was responsible for the Jan. 6 attack, refusing to pin responsibility on Trump. He also said he would pardon Trump if elected to the White House. However, he did acknowledge that he would have handled Jan. 6 differently than Trump and that he has not seen any evidence of ballot fraud on a scale that would have changed the electoral outcome. Ramaswamy didn\'t directly comment on his latest remarks to USA TODAY, but instead said that he would support a single Election Day where people can vote, along with other measures Trump has supported, such as using paper ballots.'}]"

The two are related to the wife of Martin Fletcher, a former NBC Middle East and Israel correspondent. On Thursday, Fletcher told me with a lump in his throat that Hamas had kidnapped them. “They were last seen when the terrorists dragged them away with their hands tied,” she added. Judith and Natalie had traveled to Israel from the American city of Evanston, Illinois, to celebrate a Jewish birthday and holiday with other family members. However, on October 7, they were also surprised by a horrific Hamas raid. Today, after being held hostage for nearly fourteen days, they have been released. Hamas said it did so “for humanitarian reasons” and “after Qatari mediation.” Their release also aims to prove to the American people and the whole world that the statements of US President Joe Biden “and his fascist government” are baseless. Yesterday, former NBC correspondent Martin Fletcher provided more information about Hamas’ strategy. Soon things got personal too. “Hostages are used in psychological warfare, and it is a successful tactic. Only today did I learn for sure that two of my wife’s relatives have also been kidnapped.” He added that Hamas fighters were instructed to kill the rioters and use the rest as human shields. “So it became very personal for me.” Fletcher couldn’t hold back his tears at that moment.

A bicyclist looks before crossing Avenue B North near the former Charleston Naval Base on Dec. 5, 2023, in North Charleston. The city plans to redevelop this 70-acre riverfront development known as Battery Park. Andrew J. Whitaker/Staff NORTH CHARLESTON — Without much discussion at the Dec. 14 meeting, City Council voted to approve the contract with developers of the former naval base, taking a crucial step forward in the last few weeks of Mayor Keith Summey\'s tenure. The 70-acre waterfront development called Battery Park is poised to become a hub with shopping, entertainment, restaurants and housing. The project\'s timeline extends to 2032. Story continues below ""The ultimate goal is to create a true downtown,"" Summey told reporters the day after the council meeting. ""This gives us an opportunity to develop a high-rise downtown area that will gradually work its way back to the Old Village."" The plans combine a private redevelopment project that began in 2021, called Navy Yard Charleston, with the Battery Park proposal — the same development team is now involved with both projects which will unfold in the northern part of the old naval yard. In June, City Council voted to begin contract negotiations with developers — Jamestown L.P., WECCO and Weaver Capital Joint Venture — after a committee reviewed seven proposals and the top developers presented plans to council. It took about six months for the contract to be finalized, according to city spokesman Ryan Johnson. It was first presented to council during a special called meeting on Dec. 4 at which it passed with a 7-3 vote. The vote remained the same at the Dec. 14 council meeting — Council members Jerome Heyward, Rhonda Jerome and Mike Brown of District 1 once again voted no. Heyward reiterated the statement he gave 10 days prior. “I’m not against the project, I’m against the process,” he said, adding that there was talk about meeting with the developers ahead of the council meeting, but that did not happen. While some council members previously argued that the new mayor and council should have a say in a project of this magnitude, Summey said it would not be fair to ask the new group to vote on a large project they haven\'t been involved in. Three members of the public spoke during the public hearing, stating the city\'s priorities should be on improving other areas and expressing concerns that the affordable housing piece of the project won\'t be enough.

rewarded for their dedication on Sunday, Oct. 23 at H&S Stockyards by participating in the annual Savannah Valley 4-H Market Hog Sale & Awards Program. Participants sold a total of 10 animals with an average price of $1,081 per animal and a high-selling animal of $1,600. Each participant received 100 percent of their market hog’s sale. Throughout the project, members care for their animals daily and attend workshops to learn more about animal science and record keeping. Participants showcase their project animal at local fairs before auctioning their hog off. Youths submit a record book that contains animal health and financial records to be judged for awards. The 2023 Senior Grand Champion was Alayna Weilnau and the Reserve Senior Champion was Lawson Weilnau. The 2023 Junior Grand Champion was Paige Ulmer and the Reserve Champion was Reace Hutto. 4-H members must also complete leadership and community service hours while enrolled in the project.

Shawna Nievierowski, FNP-BC, works with the practice’s clinical team to prevent, diagnose and treat acute and chronic diseases and conditions of the respiratory system, including lung cancer screening and care coordination. In addition to seeing patients in the practice, she works in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Beaufort Memorial Hospital, treating some of the most severely ill patients. Nievierowski holds a Master of Science and a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from Saginaw Valley State University in University Center, Mich. She worked as a registered nurse in urgent, intensive and emergency care, in addition to caring for patients recovering from open-heart surgery before returning to school to become a nurse practitioner. After earning her nurse practitioner degree and several advanced intensive and critical care certifications, she was recruited into pulmonary care where she developed a passion for the specialty that she’s now worked in for more than a decade. Nievierowski joins Dr. Chris Stafford, a board-certified specialist in pulmonary disease and critical care medicine, and Risa Linford, a board-certified nurse practitioner, at the practice, which is located in Beaufort Memorial Okatie Medical Pavilion, 122 Okatie Center Blvd., Okatie.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 4:38 am In addition to a $500 Million investment by ZF Group in its massive plant in the Gray Court-Owings community of Northern Laurens County, the County Council on Monday adopted paperwork that bumps up potential investment to include other projects at an overall figure of about $750 Million. Two projects were listed by company name - Fibertex and Alupress - while three others are code-named for the time being. This investment should increase county employment by 534 available jobs. The $500 Million investment by ZF is the largest single investment in Laurens County’s history, according to Jon Coleman, executive director of the Laurens County Development Corporation. Action also was taken to facilitate these developments: • Project Tomahawk, a $5.09 Million investment. • Fibertex Nonwovens Inc./Project Thyme, a $17.6 Million investment creating 38 jobs. • Alupress/Project Santa, a $25.988 Million investment creating 64 jobs. • Project Tango, a Duke Energy solar farm, $61 Million investment. • Project Backdraft, a $2.5 Million investment in real and personal property. Actions by the County Council included public hearings and final readings for some fee-in-lieu-of-taxes agreements, second and first readings of these ordinances, and resolutions of inducement. In unrelated matters, Council gave final reading to an ordinance appropriating $500,000 a year to the LCDC from industrial investments for reinvestment in projects, and authorized a land swap in the Professional Park, behind the Laurens County Hospital, with the Laurens County Water and Sewer Commission for a replacement water tank. The Council appointed Jeanne McAllum, human resources manager for Fibertex, and Amanda Munyan, President-CEO of the Laurens County Chamber of Commerce, to the Upper Savannah Workforce Board. Council authorized an agreement with the SC Department of Social Services to accept a $1.5 Million state grant for a new headquarters in Laurens County and set in motion a potential agreement with the City of Clinton to provide space in an existing, city-owned building. Also authorized was an agreement with the SC Department of Natural Resources for two historic markers at the Belfast House, Hwy 56 in Kinards, for Revolutionary War historic sites (Fort Williams and the Battle of Mudlick Creek). Council received a presentation from Brenda Stewart about the non-profit Upstate Pregnancy Center and authorized the development of paperwork to give the group right of first refusal to a piece of property in the Professional Park (formerly a potential site for Senior Options), if the groups raises the money to build a pregnancy counseling and support center. Council Members Luke Rankin, because he is a center board member, and Dianne Anderson, who had questions about duplication of current services for pregnant women, abstained from voting. Council approved a 2024 Holiday Calendar which authorizes 13 official holidays for the county workforce. After a 20-minute closed session, Council authorized a professional services agreement with County Attorney Sandy Cruickshanks; council member Rankin voted “no”.
