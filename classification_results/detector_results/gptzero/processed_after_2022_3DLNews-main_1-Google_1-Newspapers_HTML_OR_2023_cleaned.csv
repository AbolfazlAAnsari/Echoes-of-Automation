'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Photo by CONRAD GOWELL An underwater scene from Malheur Lake of Coontail Hornwort and other healthy, thriving underwater vegetation. By Lauren Brown for Burns Times-Herald Malheur Lake is thriving this year! After two dry years, followed by a hearty snowpack and wet spring in 2023, fresh water inundated the lake in the perfect amount. In those arid periods, the sediments at the lake’s bottom had the opportunity to consolidate and acquire oxygen, enabling a variety of wetland plants to sprout. The drought also led to a significant decline in invasive common carp populations. These elements converged harmoniously, resulting in the emergence of uncommonly clear water conditions across a substantial portion of the Malheur Lake wetlands. “We recently visited the lake, and it looked like a different place,” Sammy King said. King is a research wildlife biologist from Louisiana State University who has been involved with studies at the lake. “The water was clear in many areas [and there was] tremendous production of submergent vegetation, thousands of acres of emergent vegetation, and hundreds of thousands of waterbirds,” King explained. Lake history Over the years, the lake has gone through cycles of health and degradation. Former Malheur National Wildlife Refuge biologist Gary Ivey said, historically, the lake was a diverse deep clearwater marsh that was prime migratory bird habitat. Ivey said that sometime between the 1930s and 1950s, carp were introduced into the lake. In 1955, the refuge conducted its first huge rotenone project to try and kill off the carp. Ivey said photos from the refuge’s narratives state that over one million carp were killed. Carp are destructive to the lake because they out-compete other fish and create turbidity through their suction-feeding eating methods of rooting through the lakebed and stirring sediment into the water column. Killing off more than one million of them helped clear up the water. In 1979, Ivey worked at the refuge as a temporary technician on a nesting study and said the lake was beautiful. Two years prior, once again the lake had been treated with rotenone to kill off the carp. “The water was clear, and there were large stands of bulrush and cattails and lots of sago pondweed,” he said. However, the refuge has never been able to kill all the carp, and they inevitably return to dominate the lake again. Flooding in the 1980s increased the size of the lake to 171,000 acres. It was 17 feet deep at its maximum. The lake went over the highway and flooded the Narrows as well as several nearby ranches. Harney and Malheur lakes became one big body of water, and for a while, it was the largest lake in Oregon, noted Ivey. “During that flood, the emergent marsh vegetation died out because the water was too deep,” he said. “There was no way we could do anything about the carp when the water was so high.” In 1992, because of a drought, the lake receded to 200 to 300 surface acres. The lake and lower part of the Blitzen River were treated with rotenone to remove most of the carp. “In 1993, the lake looked pretty good. In 1994, it was fantastic,” Ivey said. After those floods, the lake flipped to a completely turbid state and had very little clear water or submergent vegetation growth for decades. Having seen the history of wet and dry year cycles, Ivey said he expects the lake to look good this year and very good next year before the carp population starts to dominate again. Conditions improving “If you just saw the lake this year, you would think it is in fantastic health. But we know better. We know the past history of the lake, the really recent history, and we are also trying to figure out what’s going to happen in the future,” Casie Smith said. Smith is an ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey who has been working on a mesocosm study at the lake for the last few years. In the mesocosm study, which was conducted in 2021 and 2023 (but not 2022 because of low water), a change in lake health is evident. “Between 2021 and 2023, we saw the maximum depth double,” Smith said. In 2021, the lake reached a maximum depth of 0.4 meters. This year, the depth of the lake was up to 0.8 meters. Smith said this was because increased snowpack on Steens Mountain created more runoff into the lake. The flush of clear water, coupled with soil conditions and vegetation from the dry cycles, helped lower the turbidity, allowing more light into the water column, which in turn helped plants grow. As a result, Smith noted that there was bulrush poking out of the water in many places and much more sago pondweed, a high-quality food for many migratory birds. King advised a student studying plant establishment processes at Malheur Lake. They were trying to identify what was limiting plant establishment. One theory surmised that seeds were getting buried in the lake sediment and were unable to germinate. They collected soil samples and put them in pots in greenhouses to see what species of plants were present. They found that the seedbank was not limiting. They also looked at the number of plants established in the lake and followed them through the growing season. “During the 2021 growing season, plants did establish but there was poor survival presumably due to low soil moisture and extreme temperatures. During 2022, survival was higher,” he said. A recent visit to the lake was surprising. “I have only been on the lake once this year, but the difference in vegetation coverage was astounding,” he said. He saw significant growth and expansion of both emergent and submergent vegetation. King said that the conditions of the previous years allowed the lake to slowly recede, creating an environment where plants could establish, giving them enough moisture to stay alive during the summer. Relatively low winter lake levels minimized ice scour and allowed plants to survive until the spring when they got a flush of clear water. He also noted that low water levels during the fall allowed the refuge to reduce the carp numbers, which was helpful because carp eat and disrupt the vegetation. “The multi-year combination of events is important for the plant establishment and survival,” he said. Luck and hard work Dominic Bachman, aquatic biologist at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, knows both luck and hard work were responsible for the improved conditions at the lake this year. Drought conditions in 2021 and 2022 killed off many of the carp. When Bachman first started working at Malheur Lake in 2019, he said carp were everywhere. “You could see a carp’s back sticking out of the muddy water just by looking down at almost any time,” he said. “There was a lot of turbidity and wind and very few patches of submergent or new emergent vegetation, which would be eaten up by the birds and carp almost immediately. The water resembled chocolate milk.” Bachman said that arid systems, such as the one at the lake, are meant to dry up. It’s part of their cycle. In this case, in 2021 and 2022, the drying up of the lake also naturally killed many thousands of carp. Bachman said that 30,000 to 50,000 adult carp died off in 2021 and another 10,000 to 15,000 died the following year when the lake shrank to 4,000 acres and a half inch in depth. “Fish can’t live in that anymore,” Bachman explained. While the carp were dying off, the wind swept the water back and forth, for several miles, creating ideal moist soil conditions for vegetation. In the fall, this allowed many species of bulrush, cattails, and burreeds to germinate by seed. This is something that really hasn’t happened for 30 years (since the floods subsided). Even though we have had a dry lakebed, we never had the right conditions for germination. In the fall of 2022, the refuge, partners of the Harney Basin Wetlands Collaborative, and many other partners joined forces to remove 43 tons of carp. It took about 100 people over the course of three to four weeks to do the job. Bachman said they basically removed the vast majority of the carp that were left after two dry years. He noted that the carp numbers were down to a couple hundred adults. “Then we got a really lucky situation where we had a big winter, good snowpack, good snowfall,” Bachman said. “We have a good flush of basically fresh water. That water is flowing into a lake that has a lot of vegetation growing in it, and not just the good hardstem bulrush and cattails that we’re excited about seeing, but also terrestrial vegetation — the same kind of vegetation like foxtails that you battle in your backyard is growing out in this dry lakebed.” All these plants help to hold the lakebed together where the vegetation can thrive and reduce turbidity in the water column.

highly revealing to say the least... (ONTARIO) - Several strains of mycoplasma have been ""engineered"" to become more dangerous. They are now being blamed for AIDS, cancer, CFS, MS, CJD and other neurosystemic diseases. There are 200 species of Mycoplasma. Most are innocuous and do no harm; only four or five are pathogenic. Mycoplasma fermentans (incognitus strain) probably comes from the nucleus of the Brucella bacterium. This disease agent is not a bacterium and not a virus; it is a mutated form of the Brucella bacterium, combined with a visna virus, from which the mycoplasma is extracted. The pathogenic Mycoplasma used to be very innocuous, but biological warfare research conducted between 1942 and the present time has resulted in the creation of more deadly and infectious forms of Mycoplasma. Researchers extracted this mycoplasma from the Brucella bacterium and actually reduced the disease to a crystalline form. They ""weaponized"" it and tested it on an unsuspecting public in North America. Dr Maurice Hilleman, chief virologist for the pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp & Dohme, stated that this disease agent is now carried by everybody in North America and possibly most people throughout the world. Despite reporting flaws, there has clearly been an increased incidence of all the neuro/systemic degenerative diseases since World War II and especially since the 1970s with the arrival of previously unheard-of diseases like chronic fatigue syndrome and AIDS. According to DR Shyh-Ching Lo, senior researcher at The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and one of America\'s top mycoplasma researchers, this disease agent causes many illnesses including AIDS, cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome, Crohn\'s colitis, Type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\'s disease, Wegener\'s disease and collagen-vascular diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer\'s. Dr. Charles Engel, who is with the US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, stated the following at an NIH meeting on February 7, 2000: ""I am now of the view that the probable cause of chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia is the mycoplasma..."" I have all the official documents to prove that mycoplasma is the disease agent in chronic fatigue syndrome/fibromyalgia as well as in AIDS, multiple sclerosis and many other illnesses. Of these, 80% are US or Canadian official government documents, and 20% are articles from peer-reviewed journals such as the Journal of the American Medical Association, New England Journal of Medicine and the Canadian Medical Association Journal. The journal articles and government documents complement each other. How the Mycoplasma Works The mycoplasma acts by entering into the individual cells of the body, depending upon your genetic predisposition. You may develop neurological diseases if the pathogen destroys certain cells in your brain, or you may develop Crohn\'s colitis if the pathogen invades and destroys cells in the lower bowel. Once the mycoplasma gets into the cell, it can lie there doing nothing sometimes for 10, 20 or 30 years, but if a trauma occurs like an accident or a vaccination that doesn\'t take, the mycoplasma can become triggered. Because it is only the DNA particle of the bacterium, it doesn\'t have any organelles to process its own nutrients, so it grows by uptaking pre-formed sterols from its host cell and it literally kills the cell; the cell ruptures and what is left gets dumped into the bloodstream. Creation of the Mycoplasma A Laboratory-Made Disease Agent Many doctors don\'t know about this mycoplasma disease agent because it was developed by the US military in biological warfare experimentation and it was not made public. This pathogen was patented by the United States military and DR Shyh-Ching Lo. I have a copy of the documented patent from the US Patent Office. All the countries at war were experimenting with biological weapons. In 1942, the governments of the United States, Canada and Britain entered into a secret agreement to create two types of biological weapons (one that would kill, and one that was disabling) for use in the war against Germany and Japan, who were also developing biological weapons. While they researched a number of disease pathogens, they primarily focused on the Brucella bacterium and began to weaponize it. From its inception, the biowarfare program was characterized by continuing in-depth review and participation by the most eminent scientists, medical consultants, industrial experts and government officials, and it was classified Top Secret. The US Public Health Service also closely followed the progress of biological warfare research and development from the very start of the program, and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States were working with the military in weaponizing these diseases. These are diseases that have existed for thousands of years, but they have been weaponized -- which means they\'ve been made more contagious and more effective. And they are spreading. The Special Virus Cancer Program, created by the CIA and NIH to develop a deadly pathogen for which humanity had no natural immunity (AIDS), was disguised as a war on cancer but was actually part of MKNAOMI. Many members of the Senate and House of Representatives do not know what has been going on. For example, the US Senate Committee on Government Reform had searched the archives in Washington and other places for the document titled ""The Special Virus Cancer Program: Progress Report No. 8"", and couldn\'t find it. Somehow they heard I had it, called me and asked me to mail it to them. Imagine: a retired schoolteacher being called by the United States Senate and asked for one of their secret documents! The US Senate, through the Government Reform Committee, is trying to stop this type of government research. Crystalline Brucella The title page of a genuine US Senate Study, declassified on February 24, 1977, shows that George Merck, of the pharmaceutical company, Merck Sharp & Dohme (which now makes cures for diseases that at one time it created), reported in 1946 to the US Secretary of War that his researchers had managed ""for the first time"" to ""isolate the disease agent in crystalline form"". They had produced a crystalline bacterial toxin extracted from the Brucella bacterium. The bacterial toxin could be removed in crystalline form and stored, transported and deployed without deteriorating. It could be delivered by other vectors such as insects, aerosol or the food chain (in nature it is delivered within the bacterium). But the factor that is working in the Brucella is the mycoplasma. Brucella is a disease agent that doesn\'t kill people; it disables them. But, according to DR Donald MacArthur of the Pentagon, appearing before a congressional committee in 1969, researchers found that if they had mycoplasma at a certain strength -- actually, 10 to the 10th power (1010) -- it would develop into AIDS, and the person would die from it within a reasonable period of time because it could bypass the natural human defenses. If the strength was 108, the person would manifest with chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia. If it was 107, they would present as wasting; they wouldn\'t die and they wouldn\'t be disabled, but they would not be very interested in life; they would waste away. Most of us have never heard of the disease brucellosis because it largely disappeared when they began pasteurizing milk, which was the carrier. One salt shaker of the pure disease agent in a crystalline form could sicken the entire population of Canada. It is absolutely deadly, not so much in terms of killing the body but disabling it. Because the crystalline disease agent goes into solution in the blood, ordinary blood and tissue tests will not reveal its presence. The mycoplasma will only crystallize at 8.1 pH, and the blood has a pH of 7.4 pH. So the doctor thinks your complaint is ""all in your head"". Crystalline Brucella and Multiple Sclerosis In 1998 in Rochester, New York, I met a former military man, PFC Donald Bentley, who gave me a document and told me: ""I was in the US Army, and I was trained in bacteriological warfare. We were handling a bomb filled with brucellosis, only it wasn\'t brucellosis; it was a Brucella toxin in crystalline form. We were spraying it on the Chinese and North Koreans."" He showed me his certificate listing his training in chemical, biological and radiological warfare. Then he showed me 16 pages of documents given to him by the US military when he was discharged from the service. They linked brucellosis with multiple sclerosis, and stated in one section: ""Veterans with multiple sclerosis, a kind of creeping paralysis developing to a degree of 10% or more disability within two years after separation from active service, may be presumed to be service-connected for disability compensation. Compensation is payable to eligible veterans whose disabilities are due to service."" In other words: ""If you become ill with multiple sclerosis, it is because you were handling this Brucella, we will give you a pension. Don\'t go raising any fuss about it.""

""As people change how they travel, the coast needs to be prepared with EV infrastructure so travelers have places to charge their cars when they travel here, keeping us top of mind as a sustainable and accessible tourism destination,"" the OCVA states. ""With this goal in mind, we are excited to see $364,971 allocated for EV projects spanning the Oregon Coast."" This is the first of three funding rounds, according to the OCVA. More opportunities will be available throughout the year. Contact Finn Johnson (resiliency@thepeoplescoast.com) if you\'d like to learn how your business or organization can apply for and receive these future rebates. For more information about the ODOT Community Charging Rebates Program, visit the ODOT Community Charging Rebates program webpage. Oregon Coast Visitors Association The Oregon Coast Visitors Association (OCVA) is the official Regional Destination Management Organization for the entire Oregon Coast as designated by the Oregon Tourism Commission (dba Travel Oregon). OCVA inspires travel and strengthens collaboration to create and steward a sustainable coastal economy. View our 5-10-24 E-Edition right here! Log In Keep it Clean.

A new wave of concern has swept over Oregon, and its name is cryptosporidium. If you don’t know it, you should prepare to get familiar, because its presence within the source of Portland’s drinking water is something that should be of concern in the near future. While it can get healthy people sick, it’s most dangerous when ingested by the immunocompromised, where in rare cases, it can actually be lethal. Here we will get into the details of cryptosporidium, how it was detected in Portland’s water supply, and what you may be able to do to reduce your risk of getting it. Cryptosporidium is classified as a microorganism, but many people find the word “parasite” to be more fitting. If you are exposed to cryptosporidium, you are at risk of contracting a disease called cryptosporidiosis. It’s a very serious illness, with symptoms including vomiting, fever, diarrhea, and stomach pain. If you happen to have a healthy immune system, you’re in the clear and won’t need to seek any medical treatment, as it will pass and you’ll recover back to normal in no time. If you don’t have a healthy immunity system, that’s where things get uncertain. See, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), those with severely weak immune systems are at legitimate risk of dying from such a disease. This can include people with AIDS, cancer, recent transplant patients, and those with inherited autoimmune disorders. These people, if exposed to cryptosporidium, can possibly contract a disease that is outright fatal to them. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, they estimate that only a small percentage of the population in Portland could experience gastrointestinal distress from the disease. Water was collected from the Bull Run Watershed on Sunday, testing positive for cryptosporidium. The water was last tested back in May, and as of now, Portland Water Bureau does not treat water for cryptosporidium, although they are required to under drinking water regulations. The bureau is working to install filtrations that will keep the parasite out of drinking water, but said filtrations may not be ready until September of 2027, according to the compliance schedule issued by Oregon Health Authority. Until that occurs, public health officials have made sure to implement protections and monitoring on the watershed. As of now, the water is considered to be safe to drink, but that can always change, so it’s important that you always keep yourself updated on the situation. All the counties that receive water from the Bull Run Watershed are as follows: Burlington, City of Gresham, City of Sandy, City of Tualatin, Green Valley, GNR, Hideaway Hills, Lake Grove, Lorna Domestic Water, Lusted, Palatine Hill, Pleasant Home, Raleigh, Rockwood, Skyview Acres, Tualatin Valley, Two Rivers, Valley View, and West Slope Water Districts. If you are unsure as to whether or not your area gets water from Bull Run, contact your water supplier and ask to make sure. With that, let’s get onto how you can reduce your risk of getting sick. As of writing this article, Oregon Health Authority and public health officials at Multnomah County strongly believe that the water is currently safe to drink. The general public does not need to take any serious precautions as of now, but it may not stay that way forever. We will let you know how to reduce your risk of contracting cryptosporidiosis. First and foremost, if you are at all immunocompromised and your drinking water comes from the Bull Run Watershed, you need to consult with your doctor to talk about the safety of you drinking tap water, even if the water is considered safe to drink by the general public. If you are unsure about whether or not your water comes from the watershed, call your local water provider, as a few of them take their water from the same area. If you live with someone or know someone who is immunocompromised, make sure they’re updated on the situation as well. If you are of the general population and you just don’t want to get sick, make sure you check in with your local news every day to see if there are updates on the situation.

The findings, published in the journal Forests, are important for Pacific Northwest forest managers seeking to strike an optimal balance between harvesting and carbon sequestration, an important tool in the fight against climate change. The study by Catherine Carlisle, Temesgen Hailemariam, and Stephen Fitzgerald of the OSU College of Forestry notes that the carbon trapped in the woody biomass of U.S. forests offsets 13% of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. Green plants pull carbon dioxide from the air during photosynthesis, the process through which they use sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide, soil nutrients, and water. Forests in the Northwest stretch across nearly 25 million acres and are among the most productive in the world, the authors say, with forests in the Oregon Coast Range boasting especially high biomass and carbon densities thanks to the range’s wet and mild growing conditions. “Whether short or long harvest rotations are better for maximizing carbon sequestration has been the subject of considerable debate,” said Carlisle, who led the study as a graduate student. “Future management decisions will need to strive to meet harvest requirements while also striving to maintain high rates of carbon sequestration.” The study area for the modeling was the McDonald-Dunn Research Forest, an 11,000-acre woodland northwest of Corvallis owned and managed by the College of Forestry. The forest is in the eastern foothills of the Coast Range, and the dominant species in the McDonald-Dunn overstory is Douglas-fir, Oregon’s state tree and a versatile timber tree that’s a source of boards, railroad ties, plywood veneer, and wood fiber. The researchers inventoried more than 300 stands known from past research to have four different productivity levels – high, medium-high, medium-low, and low – and input stand data into the Forest Vegetation Simulator, a software suite that predicts changes in vegetation in response to natural disturbances or management activities. “Some forest scientists have argued that multiple but shorter rotations lead to greater sequestration rates because of the accelerated growth rates of younger trees compared to mature or old-growth trees,” said Carlisle, who graduated in 2023 and is now a forest carbon analyst at Finite Carbon. “Others say frequent harvesting won’t allow forest carbon to rebound after each subsequent rotation, and thus longer periods between clearcutting are a better choice. And depending on who you ask, thinning will either enhance forest carbon uptake by facilitating growth in residual trees or hurt it by removing above-ground biomass.” Over a 240-year projection time frame, the Oregon State scientists found that for highly productive stands, 60-year rotations with low-intensity thinning at 40 years led to the greatest carbon storage (in the standing trees plus what was removed from the thinning). For stands on less productive sites, they found carbon storage was maximized by rotation periods of 80 years or 120 years. “On these longer rotations, multiple entries for thinning were required to prevent buildup of understory vegetation that would have suppressed the growth of overstory Douglas-fir,” Carlisle said. Moderately productive stands were found to perform the best with 80-year rotations and two low-intensity thinning treatments between harvests, she added. “Forest management decisions in the Northwest in the future will aim to meet harvest requirements while maintaining high sequestration potential of the region’s forests,” Carlisle said. “Management techniques like determining the optimal rotation length and implementing silvicultural treatments can be powerful tools that can allow managers to meet both objectives.” Hailemariam is the Giustina Professor of Forest Management in the College of Forestry and Fitzgerald is a professor of forest resources, engineering, and management.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:50 pm Garold and Donna Howe plan to celebrate their 70ths anniversary Nov. 17 with more than 50 extended family members and friends. There, within the hallways of Gervais High School, a spark was ignited between Garold and Donna Bullard, one that never extinguished. Eight months after the two lovebirds started dating, she 16 and he 17, they were married. That was 1953. “Her mother was dead set against it. His mother was okay with it,” their oldest son Gary recalled the story as it was told. “So, they went behind her mother’s back and his mother took them and signed for them to get married. Her mother said it would never last. It’s lasted 70 years.” “We’re happy,” Donna added. What is their secret for staying happily together all these years? “I knew you were going to ask me that,” Garold, 87, said. “And for the life of me, I couldn’t tell you what the secret of it is.” Gary, 67, jumped in with a possible explanation. “I can tell you from watching them. It’s just tolerance. No relationship is perfect all the time. I’ve never seen him not give in to her. We joke all the time, her being the boss, she pretty much gets what she wants. One person has got to be the giver. So, he does the giving, she seems to be the boss,” Gary said. Having lived now in Dallas for 17 years, the Howes shared some of their memories leading up to the 70th anniversary Nov. 17. Garold, 17, and Donna Howe, 16, were married Nov. 17, 1953. He mother said their union would never last. The first official act as a married couple was approving the results of report cards. “She brought her report card home, and I signed it,” Garold said. “The school wouldn’t accept it, so she quit. The school wouldn’t accept my signature even after we were married.” However, shortly after being married, Garold shipped off to fight in the Korean War in the U.S. Marines. While overseas, Donna moved into his parents’ farm where she pitched in running things, including picking berries. “It was fun,” Donna said. The time spent with the elder Howes rubbed off on young Donna. Garold said he couldn’t believe the change that came over her, saying Donna “became quite domesticated.” “She couldn’t cook her way out of wet paper sack when we got married,” he said, while Donna just nodded. “Then I go to Korea, she lives at my folks’ place. My mom was an exceptional cook. When I got back, she (pointing at Donna) was an exceptional cook.” Unfortunately, those roles were reversed 8 years ago, the day after Garold had a heart attack. After he came home from the hospital, Donna said to him she was going down to get his medicine. “The neighbor lady said that she was layin’ out here in the driveway. She’d had her stroke,” Garold recalled. “So, a week after I had my heart attack, she had her stroke. She never really got over it.” Donna is now wheelchair bound with limited mobility that is exasperated by symptoms of dementia. The men are now the caretakers in the family. “She always took care of the house, took care of the groceries, shopping, cooking,” Gary added. “After she had her stroke, now my dad is an avid cook, an avid baker. As a matter of fact, for their anniversary party, he’s already made 25 dozen cookies and made 12 pies for Thanksgiving dinner.” After Garold spent three years in the Marines, he said he “knocked around” for the most part, woodworking jobs. He worked at the sawmill in Valsetz until it closed and the town dried up. The couple moved to Idaho where Garold became a city employee. “One of those small towns where you were city manager and ditch digger both,” Garold said. “She worked in the post office there.” After retiring, Garold moved the family back to the area, settling on Dallas, after getting tired of the snow. “It snowed a lot there. I decided I’d gotten too old to shovel snow. The last year we lived in Idaho, the peak of roof was 17 feet off ground. The snow settled two feet above the roof,” he said. The Howes became proud parents of seven children. Garold said he redid the math after the recent birth of his newest great grandchild. Including the in-laws, the extend Howe family reached 73, including 18 grandchildren and 29 great-grandchildren. Large families and long marriages run on Garold’s side of the family tree. Garold is the second youngest of 18 kids and his parents just missed their 70th anniversary by two months. “I never heard them say a cross word,” he recalled. “You grow up around that and don’t think much of it until someone says, ‘Well, wait a minute. It’s been 70 years.’ You think, ‘By God. It has been 70 years.’” Gary chimed in to put further perspective on his parents’ longevity. “Her mom only lived to be 67. She’s outlived everybody in her parents’ generation and her generation,” he said. “In my family, old age was not a rare thing,” Garold said. “Dad was 95. I had one sister went to 96. So, I keep telling everybody I have got to go to 96 and two months to outlive them all.” Gary said, even after his heart attack, what keeps his dad young and in shape is the two of them playing 18 round of golf whenever they can, but only if it’s not raining. “And he walks all 18 holes. And I still can’t beat him. He’s the oldest guy out at the (Dallas) golf course,” Gary said. While they’re out hitting the links, Donna hits the pavement on walks with her granddaughter. Two of Gary’s siblings also live in the Dallas area. The rest of the extended family is spread across the U.S. They usually get together on milestone occasions, the last being to celebrate the Howe’s 65th anniversary. This year, they’re expecting more than 50 in town for Thanksgiving. And they’re opening the anniversary celebration to anyone in the community who wants to attend Nov. 25 from 1-5 p.m. at the Meadow Creek neighborhood community center. “We’re having the gang all together,” Garold said. “Looking forward to having them, but I know I’m not going to be able to sit down and have a conversation with all of them. They’ll Talk my fool head off trying to do that.” Looking back at the ingredients to their successful marriage, Garold admitted he didn’t really have any advice for today’s youngsters starting on their journey together. Gary, who’s been married himself for 32 years, said you can learn a lot from observing. “As dad says, everyone grows up. It just takes some longer than others. So, I guess you’re grown up when you realize there’s a reason they’ve been together so long. Maybe they do know something,” he said. After a little prodding, Garold did have a couple nuggets to share, staring with don’t expect it to be perfect all the time. “Things aren’t going to go the'}]"

A crash decades ago in some of the Columbia River’s most important salmon runs came as no surprise to people who relied on them, from Astoria and Ilwaco, Washington, up into Canada.

If there’s a bill you want passed, if there is a program you want to see funded, reach out now to your legislators. The Clatsop County housing study in 2019 was striking in its simplicity. Voters will get a second chance to sustain the Warrenton Community Library. The Oregon Legislature has voted to condemn violence and threats against election workers.

Oregon desperately needs a coordinated, effective, results-oriented and clear water policy that the Legislature has approved and the governor supports. Most experts would agree that the worst marketing plan ever is this: “Our product is pretty much the same as everyone else’s.” Astoria and Warrenton are advancing ballot measures for the November election that would finance improvements to public libraries. Mark Twain is credited with telling readers to buy land because, he warned, they aren’t making more of it. Unfortunately, farmland sold too often is put to other uses and is lost forever.

Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden, along with U.S. Representatives Suzanne Bonamici and Val Hoyle, announced the funding Nov. 1 for Astoria, Coquille Indian Tribe’s Ko’Kwel Wharf, and Newport. “Ports play a crucial role in keeping the economies of Oregon and the entire Pacific Northwest running smoothly—transporting goods, people, and services throughout our region—and we rely on them to export our amazing, homegrown products around the world,” Merkley said. “This funding will provide crucial support to Astoria, the Coquille Indian Tribe, and Newport to improve existing infrastructure, increase storage capabilities, and bolster security while improving operational capacity for these critical ports.” “Oregon’s ports produce jobs and act as economic linchpins for their communities as well as the entire state economy,” Wyden said. “I’m glad these three ports have secured these significant federal infrastructure investments to ensure they can keep exporting our state’s world-renowned products as well as generating economic opportunities for Newport, Astoria, the Coquille Indian Tribe and beyond.” “Pier 2 West in Astoria is crucial to the region’s economy, but the structure has been deteriorating over the years,” Bonamici said. “I’m thrilled that the Port of Astoria will receive close to $25.3 million from USDOT to make overdue repairs to this essential infrastructure.” “I’m thrilled that the Port of Newport will be receiving this important grant to upgrade its port infrastructure,” Hoyle said. “This is exactly the type of support that the federal government should be providing to Oregon’s ports, which are essential for local jobs and businesses on the Oregon coast. I will continue to strongly support investment in Oregon’s coastal communities.” This past spring, Merkley, Wyden and Bonamici sent a letter to U.S. Maritime Administration urging their support for the Port of Astoria’s rehabilitation project application as well as a letter of support from Merkley and Wyden for the Newport operational capacity project application. The federal investments come from the Fiscal Year 2023 Port Infrastructure Development Program. “The Port of Astoria is extremely grateful to be a recipient of Port Infrastructure Development Program funding through MARAD for the rehabilitation of Pier 2 on the Astoria waterfront,” Port of Astoria Executive Director Will Isom said. “The seafood processing cluster on Pier 2 is vital to the Port, the City of Astoria and the entire region. Federal investment into this infrastructure was critical for its future and will help provide a safe, economically viable pier for generations to come!” “The Port of Newport greatly appreciates the support of our Federal Legislators and the Maritime Administration for this investment in our International Terminal,” Port of Newport Executive Director Paula Miranda said. “We are also grateful for our state legislators, stakeholders and community for years of investment in our terminal. This will allow us to expand our operational capacity through the purchase of equipment and the improvement of a nine-acre parcel for lay-down purposes. These enhancements make the Port more attractive to prospective customers and support economic opportunity in Lincoln County.” “The Coquille Indian Tribe is proud to take part in the nationwide effort to rebuild our port infrastructure. With this funding, our Tribal One team will continue their work to rebuild Ko’Kwel Wharf as a productive and reliable economic resource that will help secure the future of the Coquille Tribe and our North Bend community and become a valuable member of the nation’s maritime industry,” Coquille Indian Tribe Chair Brenda Meade said. The Oregon projects funding and descriptions $25,315,758 to Port of Astoria: This project funds the rehabilitation of the Port of Astoria’s Pier 2 West – the region’s hub for seafood processing and maritime commerce – which is in critical need of repairs and rehabilitation. Project elements include: 1) A new steel bulkhead wall with a 75-year lifespan and that will include a new fendering system, 50 ton double bitt bollards, and a cast-in-place concrete bullrail. 2) Removal of the old timber dock. 3) Backfill. 4) Underpinning of the Pier 2 warehouse. 5) Warehouse building concrete slab repairs. 6) New concrete pavement on the pier surface. 7) Construction of a stormwater drainage system. 8) Replacement of a water line and fire hydrants adjacent to the warehouse for fire protection of Pier 2. $3,444,100 to Port of Newport: This project and funding will support the Port of Newport in the grading of nine acres of land adjacent to the port’s existing Newport International Terminal to create additional laydown and storage space; fence three acres of land for increased security; and purchase two loaders to load, unload and move cargo within and around the port, especially breakbulk cargo, which the port’s current cargo handling equipment is not well suited to safely and efficiently handle. These improvements to the Newport International Terminal enable the Port of Newport to continue to support the economic development and prosperity of the Oregon Coast. $7,729,650 to Coquille Indian Tribe: This project funds the following three components: 1) Repairs of the dock face along Lot 2 of Ko’Kwel Wharf that will bring the entire dock area up to safe operating standards and open opportunities for new uses of the terminal and wharf facility. 2) Bring 800-amp service and a shore power outlet box to the wharf to reduce or eliminate the need for idling diesel engines. 3) Support development phase activities leading to the construction of a 600’-700’ extension of the Ko’Kwel Wharf dock.

Jamie Raskin, D-Md., ranking member of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, speaks during a news conference on Republican\'s impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden at the U.S. Capitol, in Washington, on Wednesday. WASHINGTON — The U.S. House on Wednesday authorized the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, with every Republican rallying behind the politically charged process despite lingering concerns among some in the party that the investigation has yet to produce evidence of misconduct by the president. The 221-212 party-line vote put the entire House Republican conference on record in support of an impeachment process that can lead to the ultimate penalty for a president: punishment for what the Constitution describes as “high crimes and misdemeanors,” which can lead to removal from office if convicted in a Senate trial. Biden, in a rare statement about the impeachment effort, questioned the priorities of House Republicans in pursuing an inquiry against him and his family. “Instead of doing anything to help make Americans’ lives better, they are focused on attacking me with lies,” the president said following the vote. “Instead of doing their job on the urgent work that needs to be done, they are choosing to waste time on this baseless political stunt that even Republicans in Congress admit is not supported by facts.” Authorizing the monthslong inquiry ensures that the impeachment investigation extends well into 2024, when Biden will be running for reelection and seems likely to be squaring off against former President Donald Trump — who was twice impeached during his time in the White House. Trump has pushed his GOP allies in Congress to move swiftly on impeaching Biden, part of his broader calls for vengeance and retribution against his political enemies. The decision to hold a vote came as Speaker Mike Johnson and his team faced growing pressure to show progress in what has become a nearly yearlong probe centered around the business dealings of Biden\'s family members. While their investigation has raised ethical questions, no evidence has emerged that Biden acted corruptly or accepted bribes in his current role or previous office as vice president. “We do not take this responsibility lightly and will not prejudge the investigation’s outcome,” Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team said in a joint statement after the vote. “But the evidentiary record is impossible to ignore.” House Democrats stood in united opposition to the inquiry resolution Wednesday, calling it a farce perpetrated by those across the aisle to avenge the two impeachments against Trump. “This whole thing is an extreme political stunt. It has no credibility, no legitimacy, and no integrity. It is a sideshow,"" Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said during a floor debate. Some House Republicans, particularly those hailing from politically divided districts, had been hesitant in recent weeks to take any vote on Biden\'s impeachment, fearing a significant political cost. But GOP leaders have made the case in recent weeks that the resolution is only a step in the process, not a decision to impeach Biden. That message seems to have won over skeptics. “As we have said numerous times before, voting in favor of an impeachment inquiry does not equal impeachment,” Rep. Tom Emmer, a member of the GOP leadership team, said at a news conference Tuesday. Emmer said Republicans “will continue to follow the facts wherever they lead, and if they uncover evidence of treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors, then and only then will the next steps towards impeachment proceedings be considered.” Most of the Republicans reluctant to back the impeachment push have also been swayed by leadership\'s recent argument that authorizing the inquiry will give them better legal standing as the White House has questioned the legal and constitutional basis for their requests for information. A letter last month from a top White House attorney to Republican committee leaders portrayed the GOP investigation as overzealous and illegitimate because the chamber had not yet authorized a formal impeachment inquiry by a vote of the full House. Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, also wrote that when Trump faced the prospect of impeachment by a Democratic-led House in 2019, Johnson had said at the time that any inquiry without a House vote would be a “sham.” Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said this week that while there was no evidence to impeach the president, “that’s also not what the vote this week would be about.” “We have had enough political impeachments in this country,” he said. “I don’t like the stonewalling the administration has done, but listen, if we don’t have the receipts, that should constrain what the House does long-term.” Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who has long been opposed to moving forward with impeachment, said that the White House questioning the legitimacy of the inquiry without a formal vote helped gain his support. “I can defend an inquiry right now,” he told reporters this week. ""Let\'s see what they find out.” House Democrats remained unified in their opposition to the impeachment process, saying it is a farce used by the GOP to take attention away from Trump and his legal woes. “You don’t initiate an impeachment process unless there’s real evidence of impeachable offenses,” said Rep. Jerry Nadler, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, who oversaw the two impeachments into Trump. “There is none here. None.” Democrats and the White House have repeatedly defended the president and his administration\'s cooperation with the investigation thus far, saying it has already made a massive trove of documents available. Congressional investigators have obtained nearly 40,000 pages of subpoenaed bank records and dozens of hours of testimony from key witnesses, including several high-ranking Justice Department officials currently investigating the president\'s son, Hunter Biden. While Republicans say their inquiry is ultimately focused on the president himself, they have taken particular interest in Hunter Biden and his overseas business dealings, from which they accuse the president of personally benefiting. Republicans have also focused a large part of their investigation on whistleblower allegations of interference in the long-running Justice Department investigation into the younger Biden\'s taxes and his gun use. Hunter Biden is currently facing criminal charges in two states from the special counsel investigation. He’s charged with firearm counts in Delaware, alleging he broke laws against drug users having guns in 2018, a period when he has acknowledged struggling with addiction. Special counsel David Weiss filed additional charges last week, alleging he failed to pay about $1.4 million in taxes over a three-year period. Democrats have conceded that while the president\'s son is not perfect, he is a private citizen who is already being held accountable by the justice system. “I mean, there’s a lot of evidence that Hunter Biden did a lot of improper things. He’s been indicted; he’ll stand trial,” Nadler said. “There’s no evidence whatsoever that the president did anything improper.” Hunter Biden arrived for a rare public statement outside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, saying he would not be appearing for his scheduled private deposition that morning. The president\'s son defended himself against years of GOP attacks and said his father has had no financial involvement in his business affairs. His attorney has offered for Biden to testify publicly, citing concerns about Republicans manipulating any private testimony. “Republicans do not want an open process where Americans can see their tactics, expose their baseless inquiry, or hear what I have to say,” Biden said outside the Capitol. “What are they afraid of? I am here.” GOP lawmakers said that since Hunter Biden did not appear, they will begin contempt of Congress proceedings against him. “He just got into more trouble today,” Rep. James Comer, the House Oversight Committee chairman, told reporters Wednesday. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

At a time when many people in Oregon are celebrating the holiday season with friends, coworkers, and loved ones, the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) is launching Rethink the Drink’s new winter advertising campaign to change the conversation about alcohol. Campaign focus The campaign emphasizes the need for people to come together and support one another to be healthy and care for communities. That includes creating healthy environments that support people in their efforts to drink less alcohol. The campaign reveals how common alcohol has become in community settings and asks people to consider ways they can best support their friends and loved ones – and their entire community – to be healthy. Rethink the Drink, informed by significant community and partner engagement, aims to decrease alcohol consumption and related harms in Oregon. Elements of this winter campaign include a website; statewide TV, radio, digital and print advertisements; and Facebook and Instagram pages. Oregon is the only state in the country to initiate a public health campaign of this scale to reach adults 21 and older. By the numbers While younger people in Oregon are drinking less, binge drinking and heavy drinking among adults are on the rise, and are responsible for an estimated 1 in 5 deaths among those ages 20-49. Overall, excessive alcohol use is the third leading cause of preventable death and disease in Oregon. “During December and the holiday season, many people and communities come together at celebrations or events where alcohol may be present,"" OHA Deputy State Health Officer and Epidemiologist Tom Jeanne said. ""We’re trying to start a new conversation to help dial down the pressure around alcohol and help create more supportive community spaces for everyone.” According to Jeanne, the new OHA campaign and messaging explore how alcohol has crept into so many settings of our daily lives, whether that’s at the hair salon, a child’s birthday party, or a baby shower. “Even in moments when people are trying to improve their health, such as a 5k run or during a hike in the woods, many of us find ourselves drinking more,"" Jeanne said. ""This campaign is about caring for one another and for our communities so that we can all be healthy and feel supported.” What the OHA data shows Based on evaluation data from RMC Research for its first campaign in summer 2022, Rethink the Drink achieved its goals and exceeded expectations for the campaign.

Locally heavy rainfall possible. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:18 am On October 27 at 9:45 a.m., a Coos County Sheriff’s deputy attempted to conduct a traffic stop of a sliver Ford Ranger for several traffic violations. The vehicle tried to speed away and abruptly stopped on Whisky Run Road near mile marker 1. The female driver fled from the driver’s seat while a man exited the passenger seat and aggressively approached the deputy. The man was identified as Darryl J. Sullivan (55), who had warrants outstanding for his arrest. Sheriff’s Office K9 Cena tracked the female driver and located her about 250 yards into the brush, hiding at the bottom of a steep hill in the brush. She was identified as Chakara R. Hoyle (31) and was taken into custody for attempting to elude by foot. Hoyle was also cited for driving while suspended. Hoyle and Sullivan were transported to the Coos County Jail, where they were booked and remain in custody. The vehicle was towed from the location as it was not registered to either individual and had a punched ignition, which allowed Hoyle to use a screwdriver as the ignition key.

I don’t know exactly why, but I have been obsessed with all things dark, macabre, and terrifying since a young age. And, ever since I watched Mike Flanagan’s feature film, “Hush,” and his first Netflix horror mini-series, “The Haunting of Hill House,” I’ve kept a close watch for more of his work. I’ve watched every mini-series he’s released on Netflix (“The Haunting of Bly Manor,” “Midnight Mass,” and “The Midnight Club”) since then. I’m sure you could imagine how excited I was when I came across the trailer for Flanagan’s newest mini-series, “The Fall of the House of Usher.” Two of my favorite horror masterminds, in one! Warning: the rest of this article will contain spoilers for the show. Photos from web I love that this adaptation takes place in the present day, rather than the period in which Poe wrote all his stories. I’ve always felt like Flanagan’s work had a Poe-like feel to it, so he was perfect for this newest work. Immediately, I noticed that all the titles of the episodes (aside from Episode One, “A Midnight Dreary) were named after Poe’s short stories: “The Masque of the Red Death,” “Murder in the Rue Morgue,” “The Black Cat,” “The Tell-Tale Heart,” “Goldbug,” “The Pit and the Pendulum,” and finally, “The Raven.” The story of the mini-series follows twins Roderick and Madeline Usher as they rise to power as the CEO and COO of Fortunado Pharmaceuticals, a company that manufactures an opioid drug named “Ligadone.” The show begins with the Ushers attending a funeral for Roderick’s three eldest children, who all died a week after his youngest three children. We are shown the twins’ journey, as well as the children’s untimely deaths, through a series of flashbacks to their upbringing, their takeover of Fortunado Pharmaceuticals, and up to the present day. At the end of the show, we learn that on New Year’s Eve of 1979, Roderick and Madeline trapped former Fortunado CEO Rufus Griswold behind a brick wall (an allusion to Poe’s short story, “The Cask of Amontillado”). Afterward, they meet a strange woman named Verna at a bar where they are trying to establish an alibi. Verna somehow knows their secret and asks if they want to make a deal with her. The deal was essentially that they could achieve success in whatever they wanted, but their bloodline had to end with them, and since they were “brought into the world together” as twins they also had to die together. Each episode pays wonderful homage to the short story it is titled for, with each ending in one of Roderick’s children’s gruesome deaths as they play out the fate of each of Poe’s tales. I absolutely adored the structuring of the series, the modern spin on the classic horror tales, and the thrilling, engaging screenplay and cinematography – and highly recommend the series to all horror and thriller fans.

Rosenblum, 72, said she would step aside to allow “new leadership, new energy, and new initiatives” to come to the Oregon Department of Justice that she has headed since 2012. “I deeply appreciate the faith Oregonians have placed in me these past eleven years,” Rosenblum said in a statement. “At the same time, a job like this belongs to the people of Oregon — not to any one individual.” Oregon Public Broadcasting reported earlier Tuesday that Rosenblum had quietly made it known that she won’t be running in the primary and general election next year.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:09 am Solar panels atop storage units in rural Virginia were funded by a Rural Energy for America Program grant. More farmland across the U.S. will need to host power-generating solar panels for the country to decarbonize the electric grid and meet targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.S. Departments of Energy and Agriculture. But that’s not the sell that officials at the USDA’s Rural Development office use to entice Oregon farmers and rural business owners to get onboard. “We estimate that our customers are saving between 40% and 100% on their electricity bills,” said Margaret Hoffman, Oregon director for the rural development office. Those customers are farmers and small business owners across the state who’ve applied for historic federal funding to put solar panels on their land and businesses through the Rural Energy for America Program. It’s been around since 2008 but received a record $1 billion in funding as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, passed by Congress in 2022. It is now, according to Hoffmann, the single largest investment in rural electrification since the 1930s, and farmers and business owners are eager to jump on it. “We’ve seen a huge uptick of interest in the program,” Hoffman said. Applications for the next round of Rural Energy for America grants will open on Dec. 31. Applications are due March 31, 2024. Recipients can apply for funding up to $1 million. In the last year the office has invested more than $4 million in 38 solar projects in rural Oregon. But challenges with a lack of transmission for the electricity, and a lack of local technical assistance – including help applying for grants to offset the cost of solar installations – remain. Hoffman, who previously served as energy policy advisor for former Oregon Govs. John Kitzhaber and Kate Brown, said it’s something she’s trying to champion as demand for solar in rural Oregon grows. Small scale Hoffman said solar installations that provide community-level energy are the “bread and butter” of the federal rural energy program. Big solar installations, like the state’s first proposed large-scale solar park and farm in the Willamette Valley, have drawn more criticism or concern in rural communities. The Muddy Creek project in Linn County would cover 1,100 acres. The Rural Energy for America program funds projects that wouldn’t require more than a few acres and is geared at smaller solar installations that can provide clean power directly to businesses and neighboring homes. Hoffman said projects can be everything from solar panels on a production facility that cut energy costs, to solar panels on a barn or in a field that can in turn help reduce the high costs of pumping water for farm irrigation. One smaller grant recipient, Trail Distilling in Oregon City, got $73,000 to help pay for roof-mounted solar panels that have brought its energy bills down to about $13 per month, Hoffman said. A $1 million grant to fund a community solar project on city-owned industrial property in Ontario in eastern Oregon is slated to save the city more than $50,000 per year in reduced energy costs. Challenges Critics of the proposed Muddy Creek solar installation on Willamette Valley farmland have said solar developments should happen in eastern Oregon, where there is more abundant and less fertile land. But electric transmission lines from the east part of the state to the west are still underdeveloped, and much of the land is owned by the federal government, which makes siting for solar development difficult. “If you look at the eastern part of the state, there’s a lot of Bureau of Land Management land, there’s a lot of Forest Service land, and some of that land has heightened protection because it’s either sage grouse territory or there’s a threatened plant species or something like that,” Hoffman said. Siting on federal lands, which includes undergoing a rigorous environmental impact assessment, can cost millions. Then, there’s the cost of building the grid that’s needed to transmit the electricity. New transmission lines cost about $1 million per mile to build. “So if you have to build a project that’s 15 miles away from the nearest transmission line, you just added $15 million to your costs,” she said. On top of that, some large utilities charge a “wheeling fee” – essentially charging solar developers and producers a fee for using any part of the utilities’ transmission lines to transfer energy to the utilities’ customers. These more expensive issues aside, Hoffman said the greatest challenge is helping farmers and business owners ask for the federal money they need to develop solar on their own lands. “I think that the biggest challenge that we see is that an agricultural producer and a small business owner need technical assistance in order to write the grant and get all of the materials that are required to access the federal funding together,” Hoffman said. “Any investments we can be making in technical assistance increases the equitable access to our program.” View the 5-30-24 E-Edition for The North Coast Citizen here!

That’s right, as the time continues to march onwards and our societies continue to develop, we continue to uncover more things about the past. Over in Oregon, a research team has uncovered evidence that humans may have roamed the beaver state over 18,000 years ago. In other words, we may have uncovered North America’s oldest human-occupied site yet. I’m going to emphasize that “yet” part right there, because we can guarantee that this is far from the oldest site ever. The only difference is that this one was preserved by the eruption of Mount St. Helens. No, I’m not talking about the one in the 1980s; Mount St. Helens erupted 15,000 years ago, covering everything around it in ash, which can also be a good way to date how old certain discoveries are. If something is found beneath the layer of ash, for example, then it’s without a doubt older. So, let’s move onto the actual findings. So what was found? Well, we’re going to have to go backwards a decade or so, as this has been more than a few years in the making. Ever since 2011, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the University of Oregon’s Museum of Natural and Cultural History Archaeological Field School have partnered together in order to excavate the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter next to Riley, Oregon. The major discovery was made in 2012 by archaeologist Patrick O’Grady. Underneath the 15,000 year old layer of ash, they found camel teeth fragments. Yes, camel teeth, from an animal that is mainly known for traversing Africa and the Middle East. Along with that they found an orange agate scraper with bison blood residue, and in 2015, they found yet another scraper. According to experts at BLM, the “natural layering of the rockshelter sediments” suggests that the scrapers were even older than the volcanic ash and the camel teeth. So, how old are we talking? Well back in 2018, experts did some radiocarbon-dating analysis (a scientific method that can accurately determine the age of organic materials that go back approximately 60,000 years), followed by some double-checking this year, before finally coming out with their conclusion: the teeth date back to approximately 18,250 years ago, older than any known human-occupied North American site yet discovered. Let’s take a moment to think about that. 18,250 thousand years ago, millions and millions of years after the continents had split away from the supercontinent known as “Pangea”, there was a camel. This camel roamed in the place we now know as Oregon, probably the furthest place you’d ever think to find a camel, other than the arctic or the bottom of the ocean. There were multiple camels in Oregon, in fact, but there was one that had been roaming near Riley, Oregon. Then, one day, this camel died. The rest of its species within the North American continent died off as well over time, but because of Mount St. Helens, this particular camel’s teeth were preserved just long enough for researchers to find over 18 millennia later, and thus becoming the sole piece of proof that we as a species roamed Oregon 18,000 years ago; and I bet these ancient Oregonians were still rooting for the Ducks. Humans, just like you and I, roamed around simply trying to get by and survive. They built tools, had families, hinted, gathered, and grew to help shape the United States as we know it today. It makes one wonder what life may have been like all those years ago. When discussing this finding, O’Grady said, “The identification of 15,000-years-old volcanic ash was a shock, then Tom’s 18,000-years-old dates on the enamel, with stone tools and flakes below were even more startling.” Heather Ulrich, leader of BLM Oregon/Washington Archaeology, said that the evidence uncovered, if factual, is an exciting development for those in the field. “Thanks to the partnership with Dr. O’Grady and the University these new dates push our archaeological knowledge of human occupation in North America even farther, perhaps the oldest yet!” Ulrich had said. Is this the oldest site we’ve found? It is, but many archaeologists know that we may be able to find even older signs of human occupation within North America. We just have to know where to look, is all. Who knows what the next discovery will tell us?

sophomore at George Fox University (GFU), I remember sitting on my bed staring at my next assigned reading, “The Tale of Genji” by Murasaki Shikibu. It was a brand new Penguin Classic: shiny and unadulterated by pen scribbles. This was it. The infamous novel that had unraveled the senior class. Every student in the GFU Great Books Program knew the legacy of Genji. And there I was, melodramatic as ever imagining the ensuing fistfights, screaming matches, and hair-pulling to come. Unfortunately, my fantasies were not realized, and the analysis of the text in the seminar discussion was anticlimactic. Disappointed, I was left wondering why this book had enraged so many students in the senior class. One possible, and obvious answer, is its content. Genji is a womanizing Japanese nobleman who, in one part of the book, grooms and kidnaps a young girl named Murasaki. She is 10 and he is 18, and he betrays her trust by raping and marrying her. My class had unanimously agreed that Genji’s actions had been disturbing and heartbreaking! But still, none of us walked out of that seminar classroom upset or resentful towards the professors. The senior class, however, had been angry because no trigger warnings about the book’s sexual assault had been provided. The point of trigger warnings in literature classes is to alert readers to scenes or content that may be distressing. Readers can then choose whether to engage with the material or not. However, trigger warnings in collegiate settings do a disservice to students. When in any other settings are trigger warnings given? Life never tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Hey, just a heads-up but thanks to good-old poverty, you’re going to be adopted tomorrow.” Nothing prepares anyone for tragedy! But lest I sound insensitive, I will admit that reading a book like “The Tale of Genji” could be sensitive for survivors of sexual assault. And as a survivor, myself, I agree. It was sensitive, and I painfully understood Murasaki. There was a comforting pseudo-comradery that grew between us, and the insights I was able to bring to our seminar discussion were unique because of my experience. Had I been given a trigger warning about the events in the book, Genji would have been pre-condemned as a one-dimensionally evil character, and Murasaki would have been cemented in my mind as the underdeveloped character defined only by what happened to her instead of who she could have become. Essentially, trigger warnings in literature quell the potential for character development. Trigger warnings also coddle readers. I came to college at eighteen: I moved from Texas to Oregon, got involved in on-campus leadership opportunities, found ways to pay for college myself, and recently opened a Roth IRA. All to say, I have been working on ‘adulting’ for a couple of years now. But, when I enter the college classroom, I am expected to shed that mantle of responsibility and leave my adult autonomy at the door. Because who am I to know what I can handle? Professors, the now fearful collegiate gods of censorship, are omniscient; they know what content in literary works their students can handle. The sexual assault content may trigger one person, the suicidal ideation another, the domestic violence another, the verbal abuse another, the animal cruelty another, the drug use another, the abortion another, the main character’s name another, and the color of the sky may trigger yet another person. All to say, the list could go on, and it is impossible for professors to protect everyone. Collegiate classrooms, therefore, aren’t safe places–they are trauma-triggering minefields! Sarcasm aside, students and not professors should be cognizant of the material that they feel is triggering. Instead of choosing not to engage with that material, they should be willing to question themselves: what about this content is difficult to process? Asking questions that force self-reflection can be painful, but there is a difference between painful and harmful. Virginia Woolf said it perfectly, “You cannot find peace by avoiding life.” Her own past was smeared with a bloody hand of trauma. Yet in her stream-of-consciousness writing, in her essays “On Being Ill” and “A Sketch of the Past,” and in novels like “Mrs. Dalloway,” she engages with the realities of mental health illnesses in her own life and in the lives of her characters. It was painful for her to reflect on and write about her own experiences, and I admire her all the more for the contributions she made to literature because of her willingness to wrestle with her own trauma. Life does not afford the luxury of trigger warnings, and collegiate classrooms should not either. College students must not resist the uncomfortable in literary texts but embrace it; and instead of passing blame on professors for not having provided trigger warnings and shielding them from sensitive topics, students should do their own independent research on the books in the syllabus. If there is material there that might be difficult to deal with in the classroom, students can reach out to professors and find other ways to still complete the readings and engage with those challenging texts. This hard work will pay off in producing students who are more resilient, perceptive, and thoughtful.'}]"

Locally heavy rainfall possible. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:06 am Reporter Helena Ullha feels like she is falling through the cracks, falling hard. Unable to work because of a myriad of health problems, she scrapes by on $941 a month from social security, plus another $143 in food assistance. Ullha, 51, can barely afford the dilapidated mobile home in Roseburg she shares with her ex-husband. Ullha has been living in the trailer since 2001. She’s not sure how old it is. “I know it’s been here for at least 30 years, because that’s how old the hot water heater is,” she said. The trailer looks worn but otherwise OK from the outside, especially since Ullha had the roof fixed and two windows replaced nearly a decade ago. It’s the inside that’s “not great,” Ullha said. The floors are a problem; they sag in spots and some holes have punched through, including in front of a bathroom, which she has stopped using. The kitchen in Helena Ullha's trailer. Ullha’s Oregon Health Plan insurance covers most of her medical expenses, but not all. That leaves her having to choose between doctor’s visits, medications or gas money. She is years behind on her property taxes. Despite her financial hardship, Ullha said she can’t qualify for most government aid. She is not a senior, has no children and has never worked or paid income taxes because of her disability. She owns her mobile home, so she can’t qualify for rental assistance. “There’s all kinds of help out there, and I’m glad there is, but there’s just not much help for me,” Ullha said. Ullha is not alone. A survey released by the state this year found about a third of Douglas County homeowners spend what’s considered an inordinate amount of money on housing costs, and more than 40% of renters do too. The study found it would take an additional 1,900 affordable units to house everyone in the county considered to be poor. Ullha reached out for help, including writing letters to elected state officials like U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden and Gov. Tina Kotek, to no avail. “I feel like I don’t matter to the state,” she said. “I pretty much feel like if they could lock people like me away, out of sight and out of mind, that would be the end of it.” Helena Ullha inside her trailer in Roseburg. For more than a century, Picher, Oklahoma, was a national center for lead and zinc mining — half of the American bullets and bombshells used in the two world wars came from there. But that mining left behind toxic tailings, which took a toll on residents. A 1994 study found one-third of the children in Picher suffered from lead poisoning. A decade later government officials instituted a mandatory evacuation and buyout of the entire township. To Ullha, Picher was home. From birth, she suffered from ailments, including a reversed spine, cleft palate, lack of lower eyelids, premature aging of her skin and a compromised immune system. She had dental problems; her teeth would not fall out when a new set grew in. “I can’t tell you what it was like to lose a tooth because I had them all pulled,” she said. Ullha’s medical records show doctors often referred to her appearance as “bizarre,” “odd” and “abnormal.” Following an exam when she was 3, the doctor wrote: “Helena is the middle of three children. She has had a bizarre appearance all of her life and her family has had difficulty in dealing with her unusual appearance.” When Ullha was 10 months old, her mother applied for and was awarded social security benefits for her. The first check, $407, came when Ullha was 2. By the time she was 10, Ullha had been hospitalized about two dozen times and undergone even more surgeries. She missed school, a lot, and was held back in several grades. When Ullha was 14, she and her family moved to Sutherlin. Her schoolmates stared a lot and were “standoffish,” she said. Over the next several years the situation at school grew progressively worse. In the 11th grade she dropped out of school, and things quickly spiraled out of control. “I started drinking a lot,” she said. When she was 20, Ullha got married, a decision she soon regretted. “I was way too young and so was he,” she said. “I drank too much and he still had the young-man temper, and that never mixes.” The couple divorced after five years of marriage. In 2001, Ullha moved in with a friend who owned a trailer in the Northpark Mobile Village on Northeast Stephens Street. A decade later the friend died, and Ullha took over ownership of the trailer. Northpark Mobile Village, seen from a hilltop Nov. 7 in Roseburg. Jacob Schlueter, who is the housing and homeless services program manager for United Community Action Network, said the housing crunch is changing the way and conditions in which people live. UCAN often seeks housing for individuals and families, which involves inspecting potential homes to make sure they are safe and livable. The demand for such housing far exceeds the supply, and some of the homes in line to fill that demand are subpar, he said. “We do see housing that is difficult to pass inspection,” Schlueter said. “We will often have to inspect more than once to determine livability, and this checking and rechecking is on the rise as we see more and more alternate living choices. We often see homes where folks have doubled up, especially adult children returning to live with parents.” While local governments and advocates tend to focus on the unhoused, many individuals and families who have homes are perilously close to losing them. A recent survey in Sutherlin found 120 people living in recreational vehicles parked within the city on the property of a relative, friend or landlord. At a Sutherlin City Council meeting last week, Pat Lynch, director of livability services for the city, said the housing crisis has a ripple effect through the community. “We have homeless students, families, on the brink of homelessness. We have too many employers who can’t hire people because there is nothing for them to rent,” Lynch said. “We are in the middle of an enormous shortage of affordable housing.” The vacancy rate, which is hovering at a historic low of 1%, is exacerbating the problem. “I know more affordable housing is coming down the pike, and that different groups are working hard to address housing and homeless issues within the county, but folks need to know that housing is a keystone issue which must be kept at the forefront of our efforts to address community issues,” Schlueter said. “These are our friends, neighbors, family and fellows, and the challenges of housing needs to remain paramount to policy and decision making in Douglas County.” Northpark Mobile Village dates back more than 50 years, said Gary Dever, who managed it for 30 years before retiring two years ago.

A week after Linn County leaders enacted new rules for large-scale industrial farms that would effectively reduce their total numbers — prompting cheers among smaller farmers — a new group came forward to urge a reversal. “This rule change is an effective ban on new beef, dairy, egg, sheep and poultry farms and other parties,” Dave Dillion, president of Portland-based Food Northwest, a food-processing trade association, told Linn County commissioners on Tuesday, Dec. 19. We check back with some of the people we\'ve met along our travels and we catch up with politicos who are trying to come up with solutions. We check back with some of the people we\'ve met along our travels and we catch up with politicos who are trying to come up with solutions. Commissioners didn\'t walk back the new rules, which require 1-mile setbacks between what are called confined animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, and their property lines. Such large setbacks limit the total number of CAFOs in Linn County to less than 100. Nearly two years ago, when large-scale chicken farms were proposed around Scio, neighbors jumped into action. Citing concerns over public health and pollution, they urged Linn County commissioners to stop the intended large-scale chicken farms in their neighborhood. At the time, Linn County leaders\' hands were tied. Only the state could say yea or nay to a request to operate a CAFO. So the group of Scio-based small farmers — and even their children who attend the nearby one-room schoolhouse — went to Salem to advocate a change in the law that would give some power to local government. A one-room school house located in Scio. It\'s not far from a planned confined animal feeding operation. It worked. Senate Bill 85 restricted the amount of groundwater that large CAFOs can use, increased oversight of the animal waste produced and allowed counties to establish setbacks for factory farms. The 1-mile setback commissioners chose at their Tuesday, Dec. 12, meeting limits the number of eligible properties a CAFO could be built in Linn County to 89. The county\'s planning commission had recommended a three-quarter mile setback, which would have put potential buildout at 360. The new rules only apply to new CAFOs, not existing ones. However some members of the public showed up at the Tuesday, Dec. 19, meeting to register their opposition to the new local rules. ""The commission did not engage in relevant stakeholders and relied on incomplete — I\'m going to be polite and say — incorrect information,"" Dillion, the president of Food Northwest, said. He called those that attended the Dec. 12 meeting a “parade of horribles.” He wished that commissioners took him up on the offer to visit a large-scale chicken farm close to Brownsville. Commissioner Roger Nyquist pushed back on the notion that somehow the county had failed to get the word out. “I don\'t know that the gap is ours. We talked about it publicly, we gave notice. And we follow the rules,” Nyquist said. Commissioner Sherrie Sprenger said that she felt compelled to address the claim that the decision was made erroneously. A lot of time went into the research of the claims that were made, she said. She combed through peer-reviewed, scientific articles, she said. “I needed facts, and I didn’t jump on the sky-is-falling statements,” Sprenger said. Research has shown CAFOs can pollute water and air and that nutrient runoff can disturb existing ecosystems. There are also some studies that have found impacts to public health, such as increased risk of asthma. Sprenger also noted that visiting a site would complicate things — she would have had to disclose that she had considered something outside of the regular process. So she wanted to just use the facts in front of her, she added. Sprenger assured the concerned speakers that she was “hard fast on agriculture.” Eric Simon acknowledged that he\'s probably the guy who “started all of this.” He intends to build a large-scale chicken farm in Scio, plans that are currently being challenged in a lawsuit brought by Scio-based CAFO opponents. He said he felt the CAFOs were unfairly represented as having a legacy of pollution and animal cruelty; he and called the findings “animal activist propaganda.” He expressed frustration with the extent of the setback.

It’s a piece of good news during often-gloomy times. Thousands of students may get the chance to become nurses, teachers, authors, and many other occupations that help us across our communities live more positive lives. TheDream.US is already one of the nation’s larger college and career success programs, “having provided more than 10,000 college scholarships to Dreamers attending 80+ partner colleges in 20+ states and Washington, D.C,” declares TheDream.US website. “We believe everyone, regardless of where they were born, should have equitable access to a college education, a meaningful career, and opportunities to contribute to the communities they call home,” the message continues. There are roughly 2 million “Dreamers” in the country, and an estimated 98,000 undocumented students, ages 15 to 19, graduate from a U.S. high school every year. However, only 5-to-10% enroll in college, states TheDream.US website. These students are at a great disadvantage when pursuing higher education: They typically receive no federal aid for college and often have limited access to state aid, with the added detriment of having to pay out-of-state tuition to attend in a state where help might be available. Being unable to officially call America “home” clearly makes it difficult to educate one-self beyond a standard high school diploma. That was previously recognized with the “National Scholarship” that pays up to $33,000 for students who can enroll at more than 80 participating “partner” colleges/universities in nearly two dozen states. [In Oregon, Portland State University and Western Oregon University are partner institutions.] The Opportunity Scholarship was created to serve undocumented students who live in “lock-out states” – where by state law these students effectively have no access because their state will not admit them into universities. The Opportunity Scholarship Award will cover eligible tuition, fees, on-campus housing, and meals for eligible students at one of the partner colleges, up to a maximum of $80,000 for pursuit of a bachelor’s degree.

ONTARIO — A 61-year-old man from Meridian was severely burned during an incident involving liquified natural gas facility near Love’s Travel Center on Thursday afternoon. According to a news release from Ontario Police Department on Thursday night, first responders were dispatched shortly after 4:15 p.m. to the report of a man on fire at the travel center. Members of the Ontario Police & Fire Department(s), along with other local area public safety officials responded and while en route Malheur County 911 dispatch received numerous calls of a large fire associated with the event, according to the release. ”Upon arriving in the area, public safety officials encountered a 61-year-old man that had sustained severe burns to his body. The man was transported via ambulance to a Boise, Id. area hospital. He is identified as Joseph Pesola from Meridian, Idaho,"" reads the release. “A large fire originating from a commercial motor vehicle was located in a vacant lot, directly east of Love’s Travel Center. The location is utilized as a mobile station for the transfer of liquid natural gas.” Firefighters could be seen putting water on a liquid natural gas tanker that had an Air Flow logo on the side. According to Carlos Castenada, general manager for Air Flow, his company leases its equipments out to clients. As such, it was not immediately clear which company was utilizing the tanker. “We rent our equipment to third-party clients and they are in charge of delivering equipment to [various] projects,” he said. When it comes to mobile stations, they can work in a variety of ways, according to Castenada. He said they can either hook directly into a pipeline or tanks and transfer the natural gas with a hose through a vaporizer. “There are many options on how to transfer from line to tank,” he said. In checking with natural gas companies with customers throughout the region, we learned two major suppliers are not connected to the site. “To clarify, neither Intermountain Gas or Cascade Natural Gas owns or operates an LNG facility in Ontario, and our system is not connected to that LNG transfer site,” reads an email from Mark Hanson, spokesman for Intermountain Gas & Cascade Natural Gas this morning. The newspaper is working to learn more about the station in Ontario, as well as obtain an update on Pesola’s condition. First responders helped evacuate the surrounding area while fire departments battled the blaze. No additional injuries were reported. Ontario Fire Department is investigating the incident and will provide more information as it becomes available. Agencies assisting included Malheur County Sheriff’s Office, Oregon State Police, Fruitland Fire Department, Vale Fire Department, New Plymouth Fire Department, Payette County Paramedics, Treasure Valley Paramedics and Parma Ambulance.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:55 pm Jason Moos is the director for the Columbia County Business Resource & Small Business Development Center. As the Small Business Development Director for Columbia County, I’m passionate about the vitality and growth of our local business ecosystem. The heartbeat of our community lies within the small businesses that line our streets, define our neighborhoods, and shape our unique identity. The essence of Columbia County thrives in these organizations, showcasing the craftsmanship, culture, and character that sets us apart. This holiday season, Keep it Local Columbia County’s Wonderland campaign is in full swing. A fun, and interactive rally call to our community to choose local businesses for our festive needs. The initiative highlights the unparalleled value that small businesses bring to our lives and emphasizes the pivotal role they play in our economic landscape, when we spend dollars locally. Last year’s efforts generated over $559,600 in local spending! There’s an intrinsic charm in shopping locally that transcends mere transactions. It’s about forging connections, fostering relationships, and investing in the prosperity of our neighbors. When you buy from a local artisan or a family-owned store, you’re not just acquiring a product; you’re supporting a dream, a livelihood, and a legacy. Your purchase resonates deeply, echoing in the success stories of entrepreneurs striving to make a difference in our community. The impact of shopping locally extends far beyond economic contributions. It bolsters community ties, cultivates a sense of belonging, and fortifies the very fabric of our society. These businesses sponsor Little League teams, participate in local events, and contribute to charitable causes, infusing our community with a sense of solidarity and unity. However, in a world of convenience and global markets, the allure of big-box stores and online giants can be enticing. Yet, the true essence of Columbia County lies in the nooks and crannies of our local shops, where each purchase is an investment in our collective future. The Keep it Local for the Holidays Wonderland campaign isn’t just about encouraging shopping habits; it’s about celebrating the essence of our community. It’s a reminder that every dollar spent locally reverberates, creating a ripple effect that sustains and strengthens our home. By choosing to shop locally this holiday season, you’re not just buying gifts; you’re investing in the backbone of Columbia County. Whether it’s a handcrafted ornament from a local artisan or a unique find from a boutique store, every purchase carries the spirit of our community. Let’s join hands this holiday season and amplify the heartbeat of Columbia County by keeping it local. Together, let’s make a difference, one purchase at a time, and foster a thriving, vibrant community that we are all proud to call home.

Katie Walker takes command of the Gorge Composite at a Change of Command ceremony. THE GORGE — This fall, the leadership of the Gorge Composite Squadron changed hands. On Sept. 19, Capt. Mo Donahue Revier stepped down after leading the squadron since June 2020, and 1st Lt. Katie Walker took command of the Gorge Composite. Then, on Oct. 3, C/Lt. Col. Isaac Walker, after more than two years of leadership, passed command of the cadets to C/2nd Lt. Zachary Luhan. Both Change of Command ceremonies took place at the Hood River Airport, where the squadron regularly meets on Tuesdays at 6:30 p.m. C/2nd Lt. Zachary Luhan and C/Lt. Col. Isaac Walker; Luhan is now in command of cadets. Katie Walker has been a member of the Civil Air Patrol since May 2019. She has served in several leadership roles, but her experience as the deputy commander of cadets has prepared her for this new leadership position. She currently resides in North Bonneville. Luhan joined the Civil Air Patrol in February 2020 and demonstrated commitment by his active participation throughout COVID and virtual meetings. Upon returning to in-person meetings, Luhan was promoted rapidly, held a variety of leadership positions and was well prepared to be the cadet commander, the highest ranking cadet in the Squadron. Luhan attended Mosier Community School and is currently a 10th grade student at Hood River Valley High School. Isaac Walker joined the Civil Air Patrol in February 2019. He has held every leadership position in Gorge Composite Squadron as well in Oregon. As a member of the Civil Air Patrol, he has represented Oregon in Washington, DC, volunteered at the AirVenture in Wisconsin as a Blue Beret, and earned his private pilot’s license. He plans to continue his education in the field of aviation at Walla Walla University. Donahue Revier was one of the founding members of the Gorge Composite Squadron in the fall 2017. Under her leadership, the Squadron was recognized as a Squadron of Merit in 2022, and earned the Quality Cadet Unit Award in 2021, 2022 and 2023. Cadets excelled within the Gorge Composite Squadron and participated in Civil Air Patrol opportunities throughout Oregon and the United States. The ceremony is a symbol of trust and respect. A flag is passed from the resigning commander to the leadership. This signifies the commander passing back the responsibility they were given. Leadership then passes the flag to the new commander, signifying the acceptance of the new responsibility. The hand-off also represents the trust between the two. The ceremony is then concluded, and the flag is returned to its stand. The Gorge Composite Squadron looks forward to its new leadership and celebrates the success of the former commanders. Founded in 1941 and established as the official civilian auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force seven years later, Civil Air Patrol is chartered by Congress as a nonprofit organization for the purposes of youth development, aerospace education, and to promote general aviation. In an auxiliary role as a Total Force partner of the Air Force, CAP operates the world’s largest fleet of single-engine aircraft for search and rescue, disaster relief, training, and education. Civil Air Patrol is dedicated to serving America’s communities, saving lives, and shaping futures. Visit CAP.news or GoCivilAirPatrol.com for more information.
