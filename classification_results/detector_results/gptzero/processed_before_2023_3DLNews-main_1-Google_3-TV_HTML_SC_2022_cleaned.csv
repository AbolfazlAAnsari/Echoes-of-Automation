The family says the cell phone and photo-free open casket in the church sanctuary was an opportunity for loved ones to each say a personal goodbye to Davis. “Can you forgive something like this? No. Can you ever forget it? No. But we have to push through it,” Lee said. “I am so glad for the people who have come through. I bless God for the unity that we have in this family.” Tuesday’s public viewing followed a candlelight vigil held on Nov. 20 at the Woodland High School football field. A celebration of life for Davis is scheduled for Wednesday at 11 a.m. at the Mt. Moriah Missionary Baptist Church on Rivers Avenue. Several Dorchester County District 4 schools plan to dismiss early to allow for a procession through the area to the convention center. Copyright 2022 WCSC. All rights reserved.'}]"

Footage recorded by Brandon Fierro shows the moment the multi-story structure sways then falls onto an Amazon delivery vehicle in the 100 block of Sotille Street. Footage also showed a white truck passing by just seconds before the scaffolding fell. No injuries have been reported in the collapse, but three parked cars were damaged when the structure fell. Among the damaged cars was a dark-colored SUV belonging to Nicole Hurley, who works as a manager for the Merchant, a nearby apartment complex. Hurley said the damage to her car was minimal, with a couple of dents and scratches. “All of the sudden, there was actually a few people in there, and somebody caught it on video,” Hurley said. “That’s what kind of drew our attention to the window to begin with, and I don’t even remember. It just sounded like a loud crash.” The contractor responsible for the scaffolding at the Foundry Point apartment complex is Anchor Restoration. A supervisor on scene said he believes the high winds pulled out the screws anchoring the scaffolding to the side of the building, causing it to fall. Nearby residents like Alexandra Palmisano heard a thunder-like crash from their apartments. “Just a really loud crash, and we saw the Amazon truck was toppled over with the scaffolding,” Palmisano said. “There was another car that was, unfortunately, under the wreckage, too.” The Amazon delivery van, Hurley’s dark-colored SUV and a blue Hyundai sedan were damaged, with the sedan taking the brunt of the impact. The Hyundai’s owner, who did not wish to speak on camera, said the car is most likely totaled, but as for Hurley, she said she will think twice about where she parks her car. “I will definitely try to find somewhere to park before I park on the street,” Hurley said, “but I would imagine that it’s not every day a scaffolding falls on the vehicles.” The owners of the SUV and the sedan said they will take it up with their insurance companies to help them pay for damages.

(WBTV) - Some TikTok videos are getting hundreds and thousands of views, sounding the alarm on people you might see flagging down cars on Interstate 85 exit ramps in Gaston and Mecklenburg counties. Police and local leaders tell WBTV they have heard similar stories and are warning people to steer clear. Drivers have reported the man at exit 27 in Belmont, exit 19 in Gastonia, and the exits to Interstate 485 in Mecklenburg County. “Ladies, do not be a victim,” said Sarah Lee, a radio personality for 96.9 The Kat. Also Read: Police say arcade employee took less than one minute to steal $20,000 “There is a man in North Carolina where I live that seems to be trying to get ladies to stop on exit ramps as you enter a highway, and I saw this with my own eyes yesterday,” said Lee on her TikTok. The video posted shows a man standing outside of a black SUV along an I-85 exit ramp. Drivers have reported the man trying to stop people driving by, at times jumping out in front of cars and waving them down to stop. ”He’ll say something like, ‘I’m going to the airport, I need to get my wife, I need to go pick something up at the airport, I’m out of gas, I just need a quick favor,’ whatever it may be. Then it starts out as it gets more in-depth, then all of a sudden jewelry will come out to try to solidify, ‘Hey I’m not trying to get you over, I’m just trying to get this’ … and the jewelry is not really worth anything,” Chad Brown, the Gaston County Board of Commissioner chair, said. CMPD released a statement saying: “We’re aware of this behavior/incidents going on. It’s been happening for around a year or so in this area. Not all of these interactions are criminal – as many times the individuals are proposing a legitimate civil transaction. There have been some that end up in a report due to the suspects escalating their behavior. As with any safety concerns and crimes committed, we ask people to call 9-1-1 if they were victimized. We also do not recommend stopping to help stranded motorists. You can contact the police department instead to report this type of incident or any suspicious behavior. I don’t have any specific reports or crime stats on this off hand but you are always welcome to file a public records request.” “We cannot let our guard down, I know there are people out there that really need help,” said Lee. “If you see somebody, don’t stop your car. Call the cops; the cops can help them.” “We want to make sure every family is safe this Christmas holiday season, but not just that, we don’t want some innocent person getting hurt, whether it be that person or someone driving,” Brown said. Lee said the man appears to be in his early to mid-30′s and is well-dressed while on the exit ramps. “Ladies, keep your eyes open, do not become a victim. It’s the holiday season, we’re stressed out, we’re tired, we’re mommas, we cannot let our guard down,” said Lee. Drivers have reported this man is driving a black suburban with a Florida license plate. The commissioner said the tags are fake and the guy is only on exits for 10 to 15 minutes, so police have not been able to talk to him yet. Police tell WBTV if drivers witness any incidents or suspicious activity on exit ramps, call 911 to report it. Copyright 2022 WBTV. All rights reserved.'}]"
