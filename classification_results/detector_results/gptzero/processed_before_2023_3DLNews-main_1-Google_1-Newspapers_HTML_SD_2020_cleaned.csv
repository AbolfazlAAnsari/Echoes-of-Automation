Please give us a call at 605-224-7301 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Katlin Johnson and family. A group of business leaders and volunteers with almost no journalism training or experience has banded together to launch a local weekly newspaper in Kingsbury County, S.D., where two weekly papers were closed on April 1 due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. Armed only with an untested business model and promises of help from unpaid volunteers — but steeled by a passion for their communities and a commitment to keeping people informed — the group plans to launch its new newspaper on May 20. The effort to replace the De Smet News and Lake Preston Times, which closed due to financial losses on April 1 after more than a century in operation, originated within the economic development corporations in the two towns. Board members with the De Smet and Lake Preston development corporations were aware of the financial hardships facing American newspapers, and knew that Dale Blegen, longtime owner of the two weekly papers, was looking to retire and sell his businesses. Blegen and owners of other small newspapers were facing slow declines in circulation but even greater losses of advertising revenues amid the pandemic. Still, on April 1, when Blegen published his farewell editions that announced the papers were closing, many locals were shocked, and the closures immediately left a hole in the fabric of the two communities in east-central South Dakota. “At first there was a feeling of loss, of something missing that we had to some degree taken for granted,” said Tim Aughenbaugh, a De Smet business owner who is on the board of the local development corporation. “The more we began to think about it, we realized what an important role a newspaper plays in a community.” The first step was to buy the businesses from Blegen, who published the De Smet paper for 43 years and the Lake Preston publication for 36 years. The development corporations bought the newspapers’ brick buildings in the two towns for a combined $65,000. A survey on Facebook overwhelmingly indicated that, despite years of sporting and civic rivalry between De Smet and Lake Preston, the group should combine the two papers into one countywide paper. The new name will be the Kingsbury Journal. Aughenbaugh began an analysis of the former newspapers’ finances, their business models, methods of production and distribution and the content. The financial analysis showed that the income from subscriptions, legal notices and advertising would allow for a small profit after printing, production and payroll costs were paid. Aughenbaugh concluded that the only way to make the equation work was to eliminate or drastically reduce employee costs. That meant relying almost exclusively on unpaid volunteers from the community to write articles, take photos, design the website and the paper, and get the printed copies distributed around the county. Word of mouth and a social media campaign led to formation of a cadre of about 15 volunteers who have agreed to pool their talents and energies to gather news and produce and distribute the paper. “We’re learning as we go; certainty a lot of us are learning as we go,” Aughenbaugh said. “But I’ve been surprised by how many people have some kind of background in journalism who have come out of the woodwork.” That includes a man who did graphic design and layout at his college paper, a woman who spent several years as a sales manager at the Los Angeles Times, and Katlin Johnson, whose mother, Jeanne Limoges, served as the editor of the Sioux Valley News in Canton, S.D., while Johnson was young. Johnson, 31, a mother of two who is the administrator of the Good Samaritan Society nursing home in De Smet, said she is not certain what role she will play in helping put out the new paper, but expects she will help shepherd through the content of the first few issues. “I’m excited to be helping getting it going again, and I’m willing to help out any way I can,” Johnson said. “Maybe we can bring a fresh start and some fresh ideas, too.” Aughenbaugh said the group has enlisted the help of a design firm that will not only help create the finished product but also provide training to volunteers. Aughenbaugh said at this early stage, he is not too worried about maintaining objectivity or running into problems regarding conflicts of interest or libel, though those topics will be addressed in volunteer training. The new contributors will not be paid for their work, at least at first, Aughenbaugh said. If the paper turns a profit, the volunteers will become what Aughenbaugh refers to as “paid volunteers.” The community-supported, mostly volunteer business model is not without successful precedent in American journalism. In 2009, a group of concerned citizens in Carbondale, Colo., launched a nonprofit weekly paper after the established for-profit weekly, the Valley Journal, shut down. The new paper, the Sopris Sun, now distributes about 4,300 free copies at 80 locations in the ski-resort region of central Colorado each week, said Editor Will Grandbois. The Sopris Sun is now funded about 80% by advertising and the rest from donations from supporters, Grandbois said. Aughenbaugh called Grandbois while doing research before moving forward with the plan to launch a newspaper in Kingsbury County. “I told him that it’s possible, but that it’s not easy,” Grandbois said. “It’s an uphill battle and a labor of love.” Blegen, 76, now entrenched in retirement, said he is hopeful that the new business model will provide financial stability. Aughenbaugh said the new paper will take advantage of advanced technology, including use of the cloud and working remotely, and will be digitally focused and delivered on mobile devices in addition to the printed version. “This is certainly an experiment for us and we have a lot of challenges in front of us,” he said. “But we have a broad skill set here, which I think will benefit us. I do think the pluses will outweigh the minuses. Was the information in this article useful? Thanks for the feedback. Log In Keep it Clean.

Folland has two Versatile 875s manufactured in the early 1980s in Winnipeg and bought a John Deere 4440 last year with 9,000 hours on it, expecting to get another 5,000 hours out of it before he has to make a major repair. “An expensive repair would be $15,000 to $20,000, but you’re still well below the cost of buying a new tractor that’s $150,000 to $250,000. It’s still a fraction of the cost,” Folland said. “That’s why these models are so popular. They’ve stood the test of time, well built, easy to fix, and it’s easy to get parts.” He also said the modifications to newer diesel engines on tractors can cause mechanical problems, and the carbon footprint of an older tractor can be mitigated by using biodiesel, which is produced from soybeans grown in Minnesota and extends the life of an engine because it includes better lubricants than conventional diesel fuel. Combine all that with nostalgia for the tractors of a farmer’s youth, and 30- or 40-year-old tractors are in high demand. That’s a shift from 30 years ago, Peterson said. In 1989, 30-year-old tractors really were antiques. A 1959 tractor at that point would have sold for $2,000 or $3,000 and looked like a different species from the tractors in operation in the 1980s. But tractors from the 1970s and 1980s aren’t so dramatically different from tractors produced in the 2000s, other than the irksome software, and at a time when farmers are struggling financially, older tractors can make a lot of business sense. Folland said his corn crop was better than the Minnesota average in 2019, despite the fact that he farms on the Canadian border and uses 40-year-old equipment. “The main reason we do this is to make money,” Folland said. “Older equipment is a way to reduce your cost per bushel to become more profitable.”'}]"

The result will be a block of local news, broadcast throughout the evening and alternating between both channels. “We have two terrific news teams,” said Jim Berman, president and general manager for KSFY-TV. “The thinking was, ‘Let’s merge them together and create a super team.’” The final KDLT broadcast will wrap this morning. The NBC affiliate’s 60-year history isn’t coming to a close as much as it is undergoing a metamorphosis. Branding will change. Faces will change. The old studio will close, and its daily broadcasts will take shape not in the studio at 3600 S. Westport Ave., but at an anchor desk in the newer KSFY studio in downtown Sioux Falls. One of the main Dakota News Now personalities will be familiar to Sioux Falls viewers. Brian Allen has anchored KSFY broadcasts on the ABC affiliate for the last 13 years and has 17 years of experience in South Dakota’s largest market. Allen doesn’t think he’s ever seen anything like what is about to hit Sioux Falls’ airwaves. But the market is ready for it, Allen added. “There should be a block like this, given the way this city is growing,” Allen said. ‘Groundbreaking’ move KSFY owner Gray Television announced in May 2018 that it was in the process of acquiring Sioux Falls’ NBC affiliate for $32.5 million, shortly after federal regulators eased the rules on media ownership in local markets. Departing from decades-old standards, the FCC announced it would allow mergers between top-four stations on a case-by-case basis, regardless of whether they had been competitors for the same local audience. “We looked for potential transactions where the benefits to the public would be overwhelming,” Robert J. Folliard III, Gray’s vice president of government relations, said in an emailed statement. “KDLT was the perfect choice. Like many local media outlets, KDLT was struggling from intense competition from Internet, cable and satellite giants.” While other markets such as Rapid City and Fargo have similar situations — two stations sharing a single TV news service — the merger between KSFY and KDLT is believed to be the first to test the new FCC rules, Berman said. “This is groundbreaking,” he added. “Everyone in the industry is going to be watching this, from the FCC commissioners on down.” Finalization of the acquisition and FCC approval process was announced Sept. 25. Gray bought KDLT from Red River Broadcast Co. in a move that included equipment and infrastructure across the state of South Dakota. Gray executives were able to show federal officials the public benefits of the acquisition and bringing both Sioux Falls stations together, Folliard said in his statement. “By bringing KDLT into the fold with KSFY, we could not just maintain local news on KDLT but would expand it on both stations,” Folliard said. “Moreover, we could use the combined over-the-air broadcast facilities for both stations to bring free, over-the-air television service to approximately 80,000 people in South Dakota that previously could not receive either ABC or NBC programming with an antenna.” The acquisition did not include KDLT’s old studio building, tucked away behind a commercial district near the intersection of 41st Street and Louise Avenue. Dakota News Now staff will continue to move equipment out of the space for the next couple of months, even after the newly branded newscast goes live. Merger takes shape Berman said he had 17 months to chart a path forward for the two properties before sharing Dakota News Now with the world. The merger could have taken any number of directions, the simplest of which would have been to simulcast all broadcasts to both channels and continue with the pre-existing TV schedule for local news. But it would have meant significantly more job cuts, Berman said “I will tell you a lot of companies would have made that choice,” he said. Staff reductions were still part of process of bringing both news teams into one studio, and the bulk of positions affected were part-time, Berman said. He declined to give the specific number of jobs cut. Launching a new brand and approach to TV news allowed both stations to retain more staff, while also bringing something new to the market. It also increases competition for KELO-TV, which leads the Sioux Falls-based stations in ratings. Owned by Texas-based Nexstar Media Group, the KELO-TV 6 p.m. broadcast was the run-away leader in ratings in November, 2016, the last time the stations were surveyed by the Argus Leader. The evening broadcast reached 18.1 percent of households in the Sioux Falls area market that month, compared to 7.2 percent watching KSFY and 2.8 percent watching KDLT. Dakota News Now will air two hours of news each morning and three hours of news each evening, starting at 4 p.m. The 5-7 a.m. morning show and the 10 p.m. broadcast will be simulcast to both KSFY and KDLT, mostly due to scheduling requirements of network programs. The afternoon and evening broadcasts will be delivered as unique half-hour blocks, with news teams working together from the same studio to provide viewers with more breaking news and in-depth analysis. “We’ll be able to get inside communities like we haven’t before,” afternoon and evening anchor Carleen Wild said. The three-hour block of evening news could be watched in a single sitting, but it isn’t necessarily designed that way, Berman said. Viewers can tune in to the channel and time slot that works best for them, and then get on with the rest of their day. A team of four meteorologists will allow collaboration for reporting the weather during the evening block. Sports will be highlighted during the 10 p.m. broadcasts, with some stories slotted for the 6 p.m. based on scheduling and the prominence of the topic, Berman said. Dakota News Now is also in the process of adding a Pierre news bureau, with reporting staff and the technology to broadcast local interviews for national news organizations. The call letters aren’t going away entirely, Berman said. Anchors will still use them to tease upcoming segments if its on a different channel, and events such as the Olympics will still be unique to the affiliate. 60 years of history KSFY and KDLT joining forces under one ownership group turns a new page for both local TV stations. Both have decades-old roots as South Dakota TV broadcasters. Both went live within two months of each other, KDLT as KORN-TV on June 12, 1960 and KSFY as KSOO Television on July 30, 1960. Gray bought KSFY in 2014 as part of its acquisition of Hoak Media, a move that coincided with the decision to move operations to a new headquarters at 325 S. First Ave. Fargo-based Red River Broadcasting bought KDLT in 1994. The station was losing money before Red River’s decision to sell, with revenue suffering from increased competition for advertising from not just local media companies, but also tech giants such as Facebook and Google, Berman said. “What would have happened inevitably if the merger had not happened – and this is our analysis – long-range, they were going to either have to significantly reduce their staff number or eliminate it all together,” Berman said. Setting the stage Berman has traveled a lot in the last year and half to prepare for the merger. Fargo and Rapid City have undergone similar transitions, and broadcasters in Hawaii and Jacksonville, Fla., have also found ways to bring two stations together for a shared newscast. The staggered approach being used for Dakota News Now is fairly unique, but it still means bulking up coverage, Berman said. “It’s not a three-hour newscast; nobody is going to watch for three hours,” Berman said. “But the goal is going to be, and we’ve made it clear to everyone here, we need to have as much unique content as possible.” Combining the broadcasting infrastructure of both stations will allow Dakota News Now to reach more of South Dakota, giving it a stronger presence in markets such as Aberdeen, Pierre and Mitchell. In addition to bringing together the stations, the rebranding will bring together two separate online presences into a single resource. Both stations will ditch their old websites and apps. Instead, all digital content available on one app and one website, dakotanewsnow.com, as well as newly branded social media profiles. Another huge advantage: A waiver from the FCC will allow both stations to share content from their respective national networks. The most important element of the rebrand is the word “Now,” Berman said. It means'}]"

possibility of breaking the law, Dr. Keith Hansen took a moment to consider his options. If legislation now before South Dakota state lawmakers is made law, Hansen could go to jail if he prescribes the use of a drug commonly used to pause the onset of puberty in children conflicted about their gender identity. The Class 1 misdemeanor could result in up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine. Hansen is a reproductive endocrinologist at Sanford Health in Sioux Falls, where he treated 19 transgender minors last year. What would he do if the bill becomes law? “I mean, I wouldn’t break the law,” Hansen said. “I was an officer in the Navy. “ Hansen’s potential jeopardy is a matter the South Dakota medical community is taking seriously. Both the South Dakota State Medical Association and Sioux Falls-based Sanford Health are standing alongside numerous in-state doctors to oppose the bill, called House Bill 1057. Their opposition, so far, and a wave of negative national attention hasn’t seemed to resonate with lawmakers. The legislation sailed through the overwhelmingly Republican state House and goes before a Senate committee on Monday. South Dakota’s transgender legislation has spurred a striking clash between doctors armed with the consensus of scientific research, and bill proponents equipped with anecdotal evidence and lurid language they use to describe doctors and parents as irresponsible enemies in a battle to protect vulnerable children. Rep. Fred Deutsch, a Republican and a chiropractor from Florence, is HB1057’s main sponsor. In his first introduction of the legislation to fellow lawmakers in a Jan. 22 hearing, he introduced those he had lined up to testify about the bill with a stark description framing the work of Hansen, as others like him, as not even being health care. “This diverse group supports the bill because they believe that the procedures listed in this bill are not health care, but are criminal acts against vulnerable children, who are too young to understand the impact that sterility, mutilation and other health risks that are life long will have on them later in life,” Deutsch said. In the room, people in white medical coats who opposed Deutsch’s bill visibly crowded the seats. Doctor Michelle Schimelpfenig, a board-certified pediatrician with Sanford Health and assistant professor in the department of pediatrics at University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine, referred to the host of doctors in the audience as she pleaded with House lawmakers. “Please don’t let us choose between evidence-based medicine and jail,” she said. Research versus regret A Forum News Service review of the research on transgender children, future regret and mental health shows an overwhelming consensus that aligns with mainstream medical treatment, at odds with what’s been claimed by HB1057’s proponents. The research indicates treating transgender children with reversible puberty blocking drugs such as Lupron is a crucial factor in future happiness and the reduction of the risk of mental health concerns, including the risk of suicide. New research supports these conclusions. Earlier this month the peer-reviewed journal Pediatrics published research showing transgender people who wanted and received puberty blockers had a lower risk of considering suicide than those who wanted the treatment and didn’t get it. “The data is so strong for treating these individuals appropriately and with care, and that it lowers the rate of suicide, suicidal ideation, self-mutilation,” Hansen said. Doctors who care for transgender patients rely on treatment protocols described by Hansen as painstakingly developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Endocrinology Society, based on the latest and best medical research, he said. “It’s not like they just drop in and we give them a shot,” Hansen said. “They have to go through counseling, often times years of counseling and such.” The mismatch in research firepower was evident in HB1057’s first full hearing before state representatives in a Jan. 22 House committee. Bill supporters phoned in out-of-state transgender people who said they had regretted their transitions, and several medical professionals who made claims unsupported by the bulk of medical research. A psychiatrist and therapist claimed a diagnosis of gender dysphoria (the distress over a mismatch between gender identity and sex assigned at birth) isn’t an objective medical condition, a claim refuted by the medical community, and an endocrinologist compared transgender transitions to eugenics experiments conducted by Nazi Germany. A Sioux Falls family practice doctor, Dr. Glen Ritter, described the prescribing of puberty blockers and hormones as criminal acts committed by physicians. Presented with some of the research that contradicted their claims, bill proponents presented the bill’s topic as one where dueling scientific views essentially canceled each other. Representative Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, a co-sponsor of the bill and no known relation to Dr. Hansen at Sanford Health, described the bill in lurid terms he later echoed in a speech on the House floor. He detailed surgical procedures the bill would ban for South Dakota children under age 16, surgeries not recommended or performed by the medical community.

Hansen, the reproductive endocrinologist, said if the bill becomes law he’ll be forced to refer his patients for care at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. “For the life of me, I just don’t know why at this time we’re doing this, when we finally got effective guidelines that are safe, and we’ve reduced the risk of suicide, suicidal ideation, self harming, and the risk of regret is very low according to most studies,” he said.'}]"
