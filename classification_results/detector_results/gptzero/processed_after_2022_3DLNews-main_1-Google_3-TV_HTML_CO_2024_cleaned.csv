people from all over the world, but one of our viewers is sharing a warning that not every connection made while playing these games is as innocent as it seems. News5 spoke with a Pueblo woman who says making a connection playing her favorite online game ""Words With Friends"" sent her life into chaos. When Karen Hochstadter reached out to News5 she was frustrated, scared, and unsure of the situation she found herself in. We were able to help her make a police report and avoid losing any more money to fraudsters. She agreed to sit down with us to share her story in the hopes of helping others avoid an expensive heartbreak. ”I think I like to play to just keep my mind busy and it’s a throwback to my scrabble days as a kid,” said Hochstadter. She says she enjoys playing words with friends online and one of the perks is being able to interact with people from all over the world. ”Since my husband passed away in 2011 I certainly have been playing it more,” she said. Hochstadter says she’s always careful about who she adds and agrees to play with, but a message from one request caught her off guard. ”His plea that I was not playing with him because he was Nigerian and I guess I was insulted that I was accused of that,” said Hochstadter. so, she agreed to play with this new connection. She says he then immediately wanted to take their chat off of the gaming platform. ""We went straight to a friend request and then straight to messenger,” she said. After chatting and sending pictures for a few weeks, Hochstadter says the conversation took a turn. ”He started hitting me up for money because of his hard times I’d say a month after we started talking,” she said. Hochstadter says she did send money because she wanted to help. ”I got to thinking I am the answer to this guy’s prayers,” she admitted. Eventually, after more requests for money, she said she started to feel uneasy about the situation and stopped interacting with him. But then another call came… ""”They will come and get you! They will come to your house and arrest you!"" Hochstadter described what the man said in the call. ""He scared me the way he said that” People claiming to be from the Department of Justice were on the line saying she was in trouble for sending money to someone whose name was associated with a Nigerian terrorist organization. ”And that fine is going to be $16,000 and I go what?!? Right away I said what? That’s not even right,"" she exclaimed. That’s when she contacted News5 and we encouraged her to cut off communication with these imposters and to file a police report with the Pueblo Police Department. She says after talking with News5 and local police, she was able to avoid going any deeper into this expensive situation. ”Thank you! This is very important what you’re doing because it’s going to knock off a little bit of all this stuff happening,"" she said. ""It will take awhile, but keep at it and keep reporting that stuff and investigating it because it’s just so wrong for people to do that.” It turns out Hochstadter\'s experience is not unique. AARP and the attorney general in New Hampshire have put out warnings about how scammers are targeting people playing Words With Friends.

(AP) — A man accused of beheading his father in suburban Philadelphia posted a gruesome video on social media that shows him holding up the severed head and railing against the government, authorities said Wednesday. Justin Mohn, 32, who is charged with first-degree murder and abusing a corpse, was armed and had jumped a fence at a National Guard facility about 100 miles (160 kilometers) away when he was arrested late Tuesday, hours after the killing, a Guard spokeswoman said. The father, identified as Michael F. Mohn, was found decapitated in the bathroom of the home in Levittown where his son also lived. The YouTube video, more than 14 minutes long, showed Justin Mohn picking up the head and identifying his father by name. Police said it appeared he was reading from a script as he encouraged violence against government officials and called his father a traitor to his country. Michael Mohn was a federal employee, an engineer with the geoenvironmental section of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District. “We are deeply saddened to learn of the tragic death of our teammate Michael Mohn. … Our thoughts and prayers are with the Mohn family and we are focused on supporting our grieving employees at this time,” the district said in a statement. It referred any further questions to law enforcement. Police said Michael Mohn’s wife, Denice Mohn, arrived home and found the body about 7 p.m. Tuesday. Officers found the body, a machete and bloody rubber gloves, according to a police affidavit. Denice Mohn told police her husband’s white Toyota Corolla and her son were missing. In a statement, YouTube said the video, which was uploaded and not livestreamed, was removed for violating its graphic violence policy and Justin Mohn’s channel was shut down. Police said the video was online for about five hours. Mohn, who also was arrested on a weapons possession charge, was arraigned Wednesday and held without bail with a hearing scheduled for Feb. 8. Police and prosecutors were expected to release additional details at a news conference Friday. An attorney for Mohn wasn’t listed in court records, and a message seeking comment on his behalf was left at a phone listing for him. The district court office said it had no record of a lawyer representing him. Mohn embraced violent anti-government rhetoric in writings he published online going back several years. In August 2020, Mohn published an online “pamphlet” in which he tried to make the case that people born in or after 1991 — his birth year — should carry out what he termed a “bloody revolution.” He also complained at length about a lawsuit that he lost and encouraged assassinations of family members and public officials. In the video posted after the killing, he described his father as a 20-year federal employee. He also espoused a variety of conspiracy theories and rants about the Biden administration, immigration and the border, fiscal policy, urban crime and the war in Ukraine. Mohn drove his father’s car to Fort Indiantown Gap, where he was taken into custody, Capt. Pete Feeney of the Middletown Township Police Department said. Officials at the facility were told late Tuesday that Mohn’s cellphone had pinged nearby, according to Angela Watson, communications director for the Pennsylvania Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. He was walking and had a gun when he was caught, Watson said. She said he has never been a member of the Pennsylvania National Guard. The house where Michael Mohn’s body was found is in a suburban development of single-family homes. No one answered the door there Wednesday. Neighbors out walking dogs described Justin Mohn as a regular walker in the development, someone they recognized for his odd behavior. Bart DeHaven said he called police a handful of times since the summer after Justin Mohn sat on a raised manhole cover in a park directly across the street from his home and stared at his house. “It’s just sad,” DeHaven said Wednesday morning. “He should have got some kind of help.” Carrie McCarthy said she saw him walking frequently and sitting in the wooded area in the neighborhood. She said someone sent her the YouTube video, which left her stunned. “I screamed. I totally screamed,” she said. “I opened the video and I was like, ‘Oh my God, that’s the guy I see every day, and I knew something was unhinged with him.’” While living in Colorado in 2017, Mohn allegedly harassed employees at the Colorado Springs credit union where he once worked, threatening to sue the business for $10 million unless it agreed to a $2 million settlement. He also allegedly threatened to publish false statements about them or come to the credit union and make false statements to provoke police to attack the employees and then film it. Three employees sought protection orders against Mohn but dropped the case under a settlement in which he promised not to contact them and they paid him $10,000. As part of the case, the workers had submitted the lines from a song or poem written by Mohn that they felt was threatening, entitled “Men Don’t Get No Warning Shot.” In one email submitted as evidence, Mohn accused his co-workers of tampering with evidence in a disciplinary matter against him in 2016 and said the state’s civil rights division was investigating. A man who lived in apartments with Mohn about a decade ago in Colorado Springs recalled hearing Mohn talk at length about conspiracy theories. Davis Rebhan said he left the living situation shortly after Mohn became volatile one night and damaged the walls and other objects. Mohn’s only visitor during the year they lived together was his father, who visited for a weekend, Rebhan said. “I got nothing from that visit that would have made me ever think this would happen,” Rebhan said. “There was nothing that would lead me to believe that Justin didn’t care about his dad. And it was really clear that his dad cared about him because it was clear he had these issues and his dad still came across the country to stay with him.” In 2018, Mohn sued Progressive Insurance, alleging he was discriminated against and later fired from a job at an agency in Colorado Springs because he was a man who was intelligent, overqualified and overeducated. A federal judge said Mohn provided no evidence to indicate he was discriminated against because he was a man — in the length of his training or in being denied promotions to jobs. Progressive said it fired him because he kicked open a door. An appeals court upheld the finding that Mohn did not suffer employment discrimination. Mohn worked for Progressive from October 2016 until August 2017 and sued the company after his employment ended, spokesperson Jeff Sibel said via email. He did not offer any further comment. ___ AP reporters Michael Rubinkam in northeastern Pennsylvania, Claudia Lauer in Philadelphia, Amy Beth Hanson in Helena, Montana, Colleen Slevin in Denver and Mark Scolforo in Harrisburg contributed. ___ This story has corrected the name of the victim’s wife to Denice Mohn, not Denise Mohn.

Please enter a search term. by: Emily Brooks, Rebecca Beitsch, The Hill Posted: Jan 24, 2024 / 09:05 AM MST Updated: Jan 24, 2024 / 02:29 PM MST by: Emily Brooks, Rebecca Beitsch, The Hill Posted: Jan 24, 2024 / 09:05 AM MST Updated: Jan 24, 2024 / 02:29 PM MST Hollywood lawyer and Hunter Biden benefactor Kevin Morris told House GOP investigators that he paid millions of dollars worth of expenses for the president’s son through loans due to a close friendship, with no suggestion or expectation that he would receive any special benefits from the White House or the president. Morris — who has helped Hunter Biden pay for around $5 million of dollars in tax, legal, housing, and public relations expenses — said that while there was not initially a clear agreement for repayment, the terms of an agreement later drawn up by their lawyers doesn’t require repayment until 2025. Morris spoke to the House Oversight, Judiciary, and Ways and Means committees last week in a closed-door interview as part of the Republican investigations into the Biden family’s business dealings and the handling of the tax crimes investigation into Hunter Biden, which Republicans have put under the umbrella of an impeachment inquiry into President Biden. The committees released the transcript of that interview Tuesday. Release of the transcript came after public squabbling over its contents. An attorney for Morris last week accused the Republicans on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee of cherry-picking his testimony soon after it concluded. Oversight Chair Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), in a statement after the interview but before the transcript was released, had seemed to imply that the payments weren’t loans, using the word only in quotes and saying the lawyer had “access” to the White House. Morris said he had been to the White House just three times while Joe Biden was president, and only exchanged pleasantries with the commander in chief. Hunter Biden gave him a tour of the White House in 2021, during which Morris said the president waved and “made a crack about my hair” — “He always makes jokes about my hair.” Morris also attended the 2022 wedding of Naomi Biden, Hunter Biden’s daughter, where he gave the president “a quick hello,” and he attended the Independence Day picnic in 2023. Morris repeatedly said he got no benefit, favor, or consideration from the White House for paying the younger Biden’s taxes and consistently denied any connection with a foreign government. And despite the unorthodox arrangement between the two men, Morris was insistent he expected the loan to be repaid, despite assertions from Republicans they might be forgiven. “I loaned money. I didn’t pay for anything,” Morris said at one point. Ian Sams, the White House spokesperson for Oversight and Investigations, said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the Morris transcript was the “latest in House GOP ‘failure theater,’” saying Morris testified he “never discussed business with President Biden and never sought or received any benefit from him.” The interview, though, provides some insight into a relationship that has long confounded Republicans. Morris has served as both Biden’s attorney and as his friend, saying he felt a connection of brotherhood with the president’s son from their first meeting. “In what I do, I become very close to my clients, and I don’t — you know, and I usually — I almost always become friends with them. That’s just the way I do it. You know, some people don’t think that’s a good idea. That’s just the way I do it. I’m in their life. I’m in their corner,” Morris told investigators. Morris, who made his fortune in part through negotiating deals for the creators of “South Park,” said he first met Hunter Biden in November 2019 at a fundraiser for President Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign. About a week later, he visited Hunter Biden at his home for a five-hour conversation at the urging of a mutual contact, Lanette Phillips. Both men had journeys to sobriety and grew up in the same part of the country. “That was a very profound meeting, and it was, you know, one of the most important meetings of my life. And, you know, at that time and until today, it was my belief that Hunter was being tremendously mistreated,” Morris said. Morris started acting as a general counsel of sorts for Hunter Biden. “I oversee sort of the squad. Sort of like a general counsel. But I am involved in everything,” Morris said, clarifying that one of Hunter Biden’s main attorneys, Abbe Lowell, does not report to him. Just weeks after their first meeting, in January 2020, Morris started loaning Hunter Biden money and paying for various expenses via loans — including moving him and his pregnant wife from a house overrun with paparazzi to another residence, his tax debts, security expenses and more. Morris said loaning the money was his own idea — not Hunter Biden’s. “It’s immodest to talk about that stuff. … I’ve been around for a while, so there’s a lot of charity. I help a lot of friends. I tend to try to help friends more than donate to charities,” Morris told investigators. But he acknowledged he could not recall helping out any other friends to the tune of $5 million — the reported sum he’s sent to Hunter Biden. Though a significant sum for Hunter Biden, the Hollywood lawyer told members of Congress the payments constituted “less than 5 percent” of his total assets. “Hunter never asked me for money,” Morris said. “You know, these are complicated, emotional things, but I — you know, I saw a guy, you know, that was from home, could have been my friend. He was getting — in my opinion, getting the shit beat out of him by the world. I found that he had danger — you know, to my opinion, worrisome lack of support. And he was an individual — and I believe, and still believe today he’s a very good person and a great guy. And, you know, that’s why I decided to step in.“ Initially, there was no formal agreement on repayment — with Morris saying it might not have been documented six months to a year later. An agreement where loan repayment would start in 2025 was struck by other lawyers for Morris and Hunter Biden. “Let me be clear. You know, I’m not an idiot. I know the importance of these things being arm’s length,” Morris said of the loan structure. And while the timeline of a repayment wasn’t made clear, Morris repeatedly asserted he expected to be repaid. When asked by a staffer why he was so confident in that, he shot back, “Because I’m confident in Hunter.” But Morris’s generosity and close client relationships were scrutinized by GOP lawmakers, with Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) describing it as a departure from his own time as a lawyer. “Maybe I wasn’t friendly enough with my clients when I was practicing. I don’t know,” Biggs said. “But the line seems so blurred between you as the professional attorney with Hunter Biden and you with this tremendous affinity, friendship, such that you talk to him every day.” “Because I’m not sure I ever had an attorney-client relationship the way you’re describing,” Biggs added. Morris shrugged that off. “Congressman, I do a lot of things very differently than other people. That’s just — that’s just my style,” he said, noting that in some cases he’s worked for people for free for years. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
