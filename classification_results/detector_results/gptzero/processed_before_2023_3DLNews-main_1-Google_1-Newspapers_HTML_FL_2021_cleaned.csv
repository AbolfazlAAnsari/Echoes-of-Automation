But Fox News shows no remorse for stoking the anger that led to violence against those officers who fought for hours preventing the MAGA mob from possibly kidnapping or killing elected officials and upending our democracy. “Foxitis” is a virus that spreads disinformation rapidly and it depends on “hosts” to infect the public. In order for these hosts to be successful, they must lack common decency and have the ability to shamelessly lie. Sadly, not even the death of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick and the suicide deaths of four other officers after the coup have weaken some Fox hosts' unscrupulous traits. Police officers who fought Trump's mob testified to the House Select Committee, which is investigating the Jan.6 attack. But Fox couldn't allow their damning, gut-wrenching testimony to infect their viewers with the truth, so Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham mocked them, including Fanone. Since Jan. 6, Fox has made shameful attempts to rewrite history. It tried claiming the rioters were Antifa, or called the insurrection a “peaceful protest,” and claimed the FBI orchestrated the assault on the Capitol. “Foxitis” has infected many aspects of our society. Just as we seemed to be nearing the end of the coronavirus pandemic, the delta variant began causing hospitals to rapidly fill with unvaccinated patients. Mississippi has the second-lowest vaccination rate in the country, and last week Dr. Alan Jones of the University of Mississippi Medical Center said the state's hospital system is on the brink of “failure.” COVID-19 cases in Texas are also skyrocketing, causing a shortage of ICU beds, and Texas Children's Hospital is alarmed by having 45 COVID-19 infected children. There are many reasons why some people are vaccine hesitant, but these vaccines have been proven safe and effective at keeping people out of the hospital and from dying. Unfortunately, that message from trusted health experts won't be shared on Fox News. According to Media Matters, Fox undermined vaccination efforts in 60% of its vaccine-related segments from June 28 through July 11. The most urgent crisis facing us today is climate change, but unfortunately “Foxitis” has disastrously infected that issue as well. Last week the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its sixth report. Fox invited Marc Morano, one its favorite climate deniers, to undermine the report by ridiculously claiming it was just intended to “scare everyone.” What should scare everyone is that 234 of the world's climate scientists wrote the IPCC report that constitutes a “code red for humanity.” What should appall everyone is that Morano has no scientific expertise in this area, according to Desmog, a blog that focuses on climate change issues, and he's the communications director for a conservative think tank that has received funding from Exxon Mobil and Chevron. Yet, he's repeatedly allowed to spew debunked, dangerous nonsense on Fox. “Foxitis” is like the coronavirus, if left unchecked it will spread causing more mutations that could be even more dangerous: enter One America News and Newsmax.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'The general counsel for the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office resigned Tuesday after The News-Journal asked about a series of ""More Than White Noise"" videos she had posted on the conservative online platform Rumble. In some of the videos, Theresa Pontieri, who is white, disparaged the Black Lives Matter movement. In one video, she referred to a Black girl who police in Ohio fatally shot as ""thuggy."" In another video, she said she did not condone but understood why those who stormed the U.S. Capitol Building on Jan. 6 were angry that then-Vice President Mike Pence was not supporting former President Donald Trump\'s assertion without evidence that the election was stolen from him. The videos all appear to have been made before Pontieri was hired as general counsel to the Sheriff\'s Office. Her last White Noise video was apparently posted in April. In the hours after The News-Journal contacted Pontieri on Monday, most of the videos were removed from Rumble. The News-Journal recorded audio from some of the videos before their removal. Pontieri started her job as general counsel for the Sheriff’s Office on July 6. The position paid $95,674.78 per year. In one video podcast in April, Pontieri talked about Andrew Brown Jr., a Black man deputies in North Carolina fatally shot on April 21. Brown died from a bullet to the back of the head. A district attorney said the shooting was justified because Brown, who deputies were attempting to arrest, ""used his vehicle as a deadly weapon,"" prompting the deputies to believe it was necessary to use deadly force to protect themselves, according to a USAToday story. Brown’s family said he was driving away from deputies when he was shot in the back. Pontieri said about Brown: ""Imagine that, another Black person gets shot eluding police. Wow, that\'s a unique story line, and now everybody is up in arms because they think the police officers should not have shot him. Whatever.” Battle over flags: On Ormond Beach street, LGBTQ, Black Lives Matter banners wave in war with Confederate flag Schools settlement: New settlement details reveal Duval Schools to pay teacher with Black Lives Matter flag $300,000 Pontieri also commented about Ma’Khia Bryant, a Black 16-year-old girl living in a foster home who police shot dead on April 20. Police body camera video showed Bryant appeared to try to swing a knife at another young Black woman. Pontieri talked about Bryant and Daunte Wright, 20, a Black man who was fatally shot on April 11 in Minnesota by a police officer who yelled Taser but instead drew her pistol and shot him. Former Brooklyn Center Police Officer Kim Potter has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in Wright’s death. “They were both freaking thuggy criminals,” Pontieri said of Bryant and Wright. She dismissed that Bryant was a 16-year-old girl and she said that Wright had a criminal record. ""These are not good people,"" Pontieri said. Flagler County Sheriff’s Office Chief of Staff Mark Strobridge released a statement late Tuesday afternoon saying that Pontieri had resigned. “The statements and choice of words in her on-line commentary do not represent or reflect Sheriff Staly’s proven values,"" Strobridge wrote. ""A private members only podcast, which was made in April 2021 before she was employed with the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office, was brought to our attention on August 23, 2021, and was not disclosed or found in the hiring process. ""The comments were divisive and controversial resulting in the losing effectiveness as the Agency General Counsel. Because of the tone and what was said creates a strained relationship with the community. Ms. Pontieri has elected to resign from her position and the resignation was accepted effective today.” Strobridge also attached a copy of Pontieri’s letter of resignation, which was dated Aug. 24 and addressed to Staly. “Please kindly accept this as my two-week notice of resignation. I have greatly appreciated my time with the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office and I thank you immensely for the opportunity to serve our community,"" the letter stated in part. As general counsel, Pontieri reported to Staly but worked in support of the entire staff, Strobridge wrote. Pontieri was asked in an interview with The News-Journal on Monday whether her views might cause Black and brown people to question whether they could get fair treatment from the Sheriff’s Office. “I don’t make decisions on a day-to-day basis with regard to who is arrested,” Pontieri said. “The crime that they are arrested for, that is in no way, shape or form my role at the Sheriff’s Office. So people should not have a fear with regards to whether they get a fair shake.” In the interview, she said she had stopped doing the videos “a while back” because of the divisiveness in the country. The last video podcast the News-Journal found was in April. Shortly after Pontieri spoke with The News-Journal on Monday, most of her videos were no longer on Rumble. On Tuesday, none of the “More Than White Noise” videos could be found. Pontieri said in the interview with The News-Journal that law enforcement were getting unfairly criticized for outcomes caused by people who were breaking the law and then fleeing from police. She said that the media were quick to criticize police instead of defending the victim, such as the woman Bryant was threatening with a knife. In another video podcast of “More Than White Noise,” Pontieri discussed the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Pontieri said she understood the circumstances behind what happened at the Capitol ""just based on the climate of things and how dismissive everybody has been towards the millions of Americans that feel this election was stolen from them."" Pontieri said she wished that the riot had not happened and wished that there had been no violence. She went on to say: ""But when you get (a) live update saying, OK, (then-Vice President) Mike Pence is literally not doing anything. He\'s just going to fall right in to what they want him to do, he\'s not going to stand up for us, he\'s not even going to lend any credence whatsoever or any support for the president and say anything to the effect of I understand how you all feel. I mean, there\'s just nothing. “When you see that, and you hear that that\'s what\'s happening, you feel hopelessness, and you feel like the only thing that you can do at that point is, is take it one step further. And again, I\'m not condoning it and I wish it hadn\'t happened. But I have to say I get it, I understand, I am angry. I am really angry and I know that there are a lot of people like me that are angry.” Who\'s been arrested?: A look at Jan. 6 riot arrests so far Pontieri also called President Joe Biden the “APOTUS,” meaning “the alleged president of the United States.” In the interview with The News-Journal, Pontieri said some of the comments she made were “satire.” She added she could not say whether Biden received more votes than Trump in the 2020 election. “I don’t have enough information to say whether or not I think Joe Biden is the actual president of the United States,” Pontieri said. “The election came out the way it came out and he is our president.” What does she think Pence should have done? Pontieri said she didn’t have an opinion on that, but added that many people were frustrated that he didn’t do anything. She repeated in the interview that she did not condone the violence on Jan. 6. Pontieri’s comments on her videos concerned Joe Matthews, who is president of the African American Cultural Society in Palm Coast. “People in positions like that shouldn’t express publicly their personal feelings,” said Matthews. “You are supposed to be unbiased in all ways. And to express your bias to the public, it\'s really where people develop a mistrust because they now see that you favor one against the other.” Matthews blasted Pontieri’s views on the Jan. 6 riot. “That is so asinine and so ridiculous for her to think that way,” Matthews said. “These people (the rioters) came with the express purpose of overthrowing the government, because of the lie that then-President Trump was perpetrating.” On Wednesday, told Pontieri had resigned, Matthews said that was the right thing to happen. “Well, I think that based on the things that she spewed and her personal views being public, it’s a good thing that she’s gone,” he said.'}]"

Gallagher & Co. had been trying to buy Harden and Associates Inc. for about 25 years before the deal was completed Dec. 29 for an undisclosed price. CEO M.C. “Ceree” Harden III said Jan. 11 that the company began a succession plan in 2012. He said that in the past several years as the mergers and acquisitions market “heated up,” it became clear to Harden’s leaders that the best financial option for their independently owned company was to align with a larger organization. “We decided we would explore a strategic alignment with larger organizations,” Harden said. “Our criteria for assessing opportunities was No. 1, will it be accretive to the client, will we have more resources to deliver the greater or larger value proposition? No. 2, will it be good for our colleagues and associates? And No. 3, will it be good for the community?” After receiving calls from dozens of possible acquirers, Harden narrowed the options to five companies. Harden and his team set five criteria they wanted an acquirer to meet. They found Gallagher to be the best fit. “Their mission and culture are more aligned with us, they have been an insurance broker for 100 years,” he said. “The scope of resources that they were able to bring to bear to our clients that increase the value proposition was as great or greater than any of the alternatives we looked at,” he said. “We also believed the opportunities available to our associates would be greater in terms of opportunity for promotion and achieving their potential.” Harden offers insurance, risk management, employee benefits and other services to businesses and individuals in Florida. It has a focus on the health care, real estate and construction industries. Harden’s father, M.C. Harden Jr., started the company in 1953. Harden wrote $600 million in premiums last year. It did about the same in 2019, Harden said. Gallagher is a global insurance brokerage, risk management and consulting services firm headquartered in Rolling Meadows, outside of Chicago. It has offices in 49 countries and offers its services in 150 countries through a network of brokers and consultants. Harden will be part of Gallagher’s Southeast division. Eventually, Harden will be rebranded as Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., replacing the signage in front of its office at 501 Riverside Ave. Harden, 67, will become area chairman for Gallagher. He joined the company in 1976 following graduation from the University of Florida. Justin Terry, Harden’s president and chief business development officer, will become a Gallagher senior vice president. Jeremy Miller also will become a Gallagher senior vice president. He served as executive vice president and commercial insurance division account director with Harden. Harden’s team, for the most part, will continue to operate business as usual. There are 140 employees throughout its offices in Jacksonville, Amelia Island and Tampa. “What we’ve seen so far, just keep doing what you’re doing,” Terry said. “Let us give you additional tools with which to execute the work. From what we’ve seen so far, as a consultant, there’s a lot more capacity to help clients.” The merger will help Harden service sectors where it previously didn’t have the expertise.

The ROAR Marching Band of FMU Images of Florida Memorial University, taken from beyond its entrance. Security guards prevented Miami Times reporter Bianca Marcof from entering campus grounds. Florida Memorial University has been placed on probation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) for failure to meet federal and state responsibilities, as well as financial standard requirements. The HBCU’s accreditation was placed on a 12-month “Probation for Good Cause” after the accrediting agency’s board of trustees found the school to be in noncompliance with the core requirements and standards of its principles of accreditation. The public sanction came after the university was at the end of its two-year monitoring period for failure to comply with Core Requirement 4.1 b (governing board characteristics), Standard 13.3 (financial responsibility), Standard 13.4 (control of finances) and Standard 13.6 (federal and state responsibilities). Probation, a much more serious sanction than a warning, is usually brought forth as the final step before an institution is removed from membership. Jaffus Hardrick became FMU's 14th president on March 22, 2019. He served as interim president in 2018. Days after the probation was set, Jaffus Hardrick, FMU president, released a statement addressing the accreditation status: “The issues that led to this action occurred over numerous years of dealing with financial challenges, declining enrollment, and aging infrastructure. Unfortunately, COVID-19 impacted enrollment for academic year 2020, thus affecting overall revenue. The ROAR Marching Band of FMU “As a result of our growth strategies, FMU is well on its way to resolving these issues. New enrollment initiatives, new academic programs, a focus on student life, enhanced infrastructure, the addition of new athletic programs, band, and certificate programs are already yielding positive results to stabilize and grow enrollment.” Hardrick became FMU's 14th president on March 22, 2019, after serving as interim president in 2018. An online petition first posted on change.org, that appears to have started by alumni over the 4th of July holiday weekend, is calling for Hardrick's removal, despite indications from SACSCOC that FMU has demonstrated enough proof for them to assume that the school will sort out all deficiencies within 12 months. “All institutions’ practices are reviewed periodically,” said Janea Johnson, spokesperson for SACSCOC. “Institutions have a five-year report ... and they go up for reaffirmation of accreditation every 10 years.” A special committee was authorized to visit FMU’s Miami Gardens campus, but Johnson did not reveal when the institutional review would take place. “It will happen, it just has not occurred yet,” she said. Adrienne Cooper, FMU provost, said the news was unexpected. “We were a little surprised,” she said. “We knew that we had submitted the report and we just had to wait to hear what SACS had to say.” When asked about infrastructure, Cooper did not name any specific structures, but said FMU has “done upgrades on a number of buildings” for the last several years. For enrollment and student success, she noted that to reflect positive changes, FMU changed its slogan in the beginning of this year to “Own your excellence.” She also mentioned the school’s strategic plan. Introduced this year, FMU’s new slogan reads “Own your excellence.” “[It] really outlines a number of things that we’re doing around enrollment and student success,” Cooper said. The plan details the university’s efforts around student recruitment, such as working with high school counselors and hosting events throughout the tri-county area. For student success, the plan lists providing guest speakers focused on assisting students with employment, and increasing campus pride on campus through promoting and creating events, learning activities, athletics and other traditions. FMU also outlined its intent to strengthen its current aviation, business, education and STEM programs, and endeavoring to develop new programs in health care, such as a physician assistant degree. The university’s ultimate goal, as listed in the plan, is to increase its student body to 3,000. FMU has refused to reveal current enrollment figure to The Miami Times, but numerous sources say it's dipped below 500. According to blackpast.org, in 1976 it had 402 students and by 2008, the enrollment stood at 1,807. In his public statement, Hardrick mentioned that SACSCOC’s board of trustees approved the university’s newest degree program, an online Master of Science in exceptional student education, to be launched in the fall. The university remains accredited, but if financial complications continue to affect the school and total enrollment continues to fall dramatically, FMU’s accreditation may be removed. Florida Memorial University banners lined up across the street from campus. When a college loses accreditation, its students and employees can expect serious consequences. The school would lose out on federal and state funding, and diplomas could become invalidated. Employers and institutions of higher learning cannot accept diplomas from unaccredited colleges, so students in particular would experience difficulty transferring to other institutions before graduating. After reviewing two reports submitted by the university and the SACSCOC special committee, the board will reconsider FMU’s accreditation status in June 2022, when the school will mark one year of probation. The board will either remove it from probation; keep the probation in place for another year; or remove its accreditation for failure to comply. According to SACSCOC’s disclosure statement regarding the university’s status, FMU is expected to have a governing board that exercises fiduciary oversight of the institution, manage its financial resources responsibly, exercise appropriate control over all its finances, and audit financial aid programs as required by federal and state regulations. Cooper believes the university will meet the requirements for continued accreditation next year. “We are making progress every day toward that and even the information that we received from SACS acknowledges that,” she said. “Probation for good cause can only be given if the SACSCOC board of trustees sees progress and believes that you have the potential to meet the requirements in the near future.” The petition circulating for Jaffus Hardrick to be replaced cites reasons beyond the current accreditation probation, including increased and unreported rapes and shootings on campus; a culture of sexual harrassment; a culture of intimidation and retaliation; a continued decline in enrollment; unreliable technology systems; and overall poor leadership. FMU began as the Florida Baptist Institute in 1879, established by members of the Bethlehem Baptist Association in Live Oak, Fla. When shots were fired into one of the school’s buildings, staff members fled to Jacksonville, where Florida Baptist Academy was formed in the basement of Bethel Baptist Church. Classes continued in Live Oak and in 1896 both institutions merged. With a growing student body, the institute moved to St. Augustine in 1918 on part of a 400-acre land known as “Old Homes Plantation,” formerly one of the largest slave plantations in the state. FMU St. Augustine campus 1915-1966 During the civil rights movement in the 1950s and ’60s, students protested segregation, participating in sit-ins, wade-ins and swim-ins. Concerned by race-related violence in the city and feeling unwelcome in St. Augustine, the college bought a tract of land near Opa-locka in 1965 and adopted the name Florida Memorial University in 2004. Today, it is the only HBCU in South Florida and offers 28 undergraduate degree programs and three master’s programs.

(Voltaire) “Do you know why books such as this are so important? Because they have quality. And what does the word quality mean? To me it means texture. This book has pores.” (Professor Faber, Fahrenheit 451) Banned Books Week began in 1982, when it was co-founded by Judith Krug, former director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom at the American Library Association (ALA) and executive director of the Freedom to Read Foundation, in response to the sudden surge in the number of challenges to books in schools, bookstores and libraries. A challenge refers to an attempt to remove or restrict books or materials based on the objections of a person or group; banning means the books or materials have been removed. One of the many challenges was the famous Island Trees School District v. Pico Supreme Court case, in which it was ruled school officials aren\'t allowed to ban books in libraries simply because of their content. Now, Banned Books Week is held during the last week of September to both bring awareness to literature being banned, as well as celebrate the freedom to read. In highlighting attempts, both current and historical, to censor the public\'s ability to read certain books in bookstores, libraries and schools, Banned Books Week opens up discussions into the power literature has to create a uniting force. This year, the ALA\'s Banned Books Week theme is “Books Unite Us. Censorship Divides Us.” “Sharing stories important to us means sharing a part of ourselves. Books reach across boundaries and build connections between readers. Censorship, on the other hand, creates barriers,” the ALA states on its website. “The books featured during Banned Books Week have all been targeted for removal or restriction in libraries and schools. By focusing on efforts across the country to remove or restrict access to books, Banned Books Week draws national attention to the harms of censorship.” “While books have been and continue to be banned, part of the Banned Books Week celebration is the fact that, in a majority of cases, the books have remained available. This happens only thanks to the efforts of librarians, teachers, students and community members who stand up and speak out for the freedom to read,” the ALA website states. Classic novels, many of which are known for being required reading materials in schools, have been challenged numerous times and even banned in various countries. A few of these, as listed by the ALA, include works, such as “The Great Gatsby” by F. Scott Fitzgerald; “The Catcher in the Rye” by JD Salinger; “1984” by George Orwell; “Gone with the Wind” by Margaret Mitchell; “The Color Purple” by Alice Walker; “Brave New World” by Aldous Huxley; “The Lord of the Flies” by William Golding and even “The Lord of the Rings” by J.R.R. Tolkien. Today, Banned Books Week reaches approximately 2.8 billion readers and more than 90,000 publishing industries and library subscribers. However, books continue to be challenged and banned to this day. The ALA goes on to list the top 10 challenged books of 2020. The top themes include racism, racial injustice, stories shared from Black, Indigenous and people of color, as well as LGBTQIA+ content. Included in this list are: • “George” by Alex Gino, which was challenged, banned and restricted for LGBTQIA+ content, conflicting with a religious viewpoint and not reflecting “the values of our community.” • “Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You” by Ibram X. Kendi and Jason Reynolds, which was challenged and banned because of the author\'s public statements and because of claims that the book contains “selective storytelling incidents” and does not encompass racism against all people. • “All American Boys” by Jason Reynolds and Brendan Kiely, which was challenged and banned for profanity, drug use and alcoholism and because it was thought to promote anti-police views, contain divisive topics and be “too much of a sensitive matter right now.” • “Speak” by Laurie Halse Anderson, which was challenged, banned and restricted because it was thought to contain a political viewpoint and it was claimed to be biased against male students and for the novel\'s inclusion of rape and profanity. • “The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian” by Sherman Alexie, which was challenged and banned for profanity, sexual references and allegations of sexual misconduct by the author. • “Something Happened in Our Town: A Child\'s Story About Racial Injustice” by Marianne Celano, Marietta Collins and Ann Hazzard, illustrated by Jennifer Zivoin, which was challenged for “divisive language” and because it was thought to promote anti-police views. • “To Kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee which was challenged and banned for racial slurs and their negative effect on students, featuring a “white savior” character and its perception of the Black experience. • “Of Mice and Men” by John Steinbeck, which was challenged and banned for racial slurs and racist stereotypes and their negative effect on students. • “The Bluest Eye” by Toni Morrison, which was challenged and banned because it was considered sexually explicit and depicts child sexual abuse. • “The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas, which was challenged for profanity and it was thought to promote an anti-police message.

Suspended Sumter commissioner Oren Miller’s felony perjury trial will begin the day after Election Day, a judge ordered Tuesday. Sumter County commissioners remain locked in on delivering the county’s largest property tax-rate cut in 15 years. Sumter County’s foray into providing a no-kill animal shelter has been a failure, commissioners agreed Tuesday. The county will shift to a “socially conscious sheltering” model in a move designed to provide more humane treatment for the animals, the board unanimously decided. Sumter voters on Tuesday rejected an attempt to oust two of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ appointees from the county commission and also voted in two newcomers who have deep backgrounds in public safety. Incumbents Roberta Ulrich and Don Wiley will continue to serve in Districts 1 and 5, respectively. … A few passing clouds. Low 68F. Winds ESE at 5 to 10 mph. A few passing clouds. Low 68F.

The album is split into two parts, the first consisting of all capital-lettered titles to emphasize frustration and surface level emotions. The second half of the track is all lower-case, to highlight the finer details and more complex emotions that come with being in the spotlight. This album is raw, unapologetic, and passionate. 45 SMOKE- A classic example of British drill. Slowthai’s flow throughout the song is hypnotizing as he changes tempo throughout. The song is about making constant mistakes. CANCELLED- This track features Skepta. This is an interesting sounding track. The beginning instrumental is really good, then switches up when it comes to slowthai’s verse. This song seems to be talking about cancel culture. MAZZA- the track itself sounds good. I’m not a huge fan of this track because of the repetition, but it seems like it’s just a fun track for both A$AP Rocky and slowthai. VEX- i’m also not a fan of this track. It’s repetitive and the production is a bit odd. I do like the beginning chorus though, it’s interesting. WOT- This is a short track. It’s about slowthai’s anger at Pop Smoke passing away. At surface level it’s hard to understand, as it has a lot of british slang. DEAD- The bass line on this track is very groovy. Slowthai decides to adapt to a slower flow, which I personally enjoy. This track talks about eternity. PLAY WITH FIRE- This track is a perfect transition into the second half of his album-it has a more mellow track, and the subject matter changes to more personal aspects of slowthai’s life. The end of this track is particularly hypnotizing. i tried- As the first track of the second half, it sets the tone for what’s to come. It has soulful chords with groovy bass. focus- This song is very jazzy in a way. He talks about going against the grain of life. It has some lo-fi aspects to it also. terms- this track starts off with Dominic Fike, the bass is strong and has a simple beat as slowthai raps about the misunderstandings that come with fame. push- The intro to this track is beautiful. Deb Never’s soothing vocals and subtle harmonies are so calming. It’s a nice change of sound, the overall tone of this track is mellow in a good way. nhs- This is another one of my favorite tracks. This song is one of the easier ones to understand, as it keeps slang to a minimum. It’s relatable. feel away- this track is about slowthai’s late brother. This is my favorite on the album, with emotional vocals from James Blake. The cadence of this track is otherworldly-it will leave you thinking. adhd- Slowthai delves into his struggle with ADHD. His mom never believed him as a child, and it’s caused a lot of problems in his life. The sound of this track is unique-it’s calm but there’s a depth to it. Toward the end of the track is a sound byte of slowthai on the phone with his older brother. This track ends abruptly. Overall I enjoyed this album. I had been a fan of slowthai’s appearances with Gorillaz and BROCKHAMPTON so I was excited. This was a good introduction to the sub-genre,”British drill”, which is a gritty, repetitive style of rap. I enjoyed the second half of the album more but overall it was very creative. I’d rate this album a 3.5 out of 5 Spinnaker Sails.

Originally from Jacksonville, he moved to Keystone Heights as a child and remained in the Keystone Lake Region throughout his life as an accomplished, certified building contractor. In the year of 1985, Mike earned his bachelor’s degree in Mechanized Agriculture from the University of Florida, while he and his family of four lived at Indian Lake Ranch, where he grew timber and worked as a cattle rancher for quite some time. A few years later, he became a building contractor, working to improve and build hundreds of homes for families in much of North Florida. Mike later built his dream home, where he enjoyed his life on Melrose Lake. After overcoming his battle with cancer and selling his home in Melrose, he settled down in Green Cove Springs. Mike loved the outdoors. He would always talk about riding his dirt bike all over town during his younger years, camping, hiking, air-boating and getting lost on dirt roads in his Jeep. Mike lived his life to the fullest. He was happy and successful, and his life was a true testament of courage and strength. He was truly a self-made man, who loved his work as much as he loved helping people. Mike always had a smile on his face and would greet you with a firm handshake or a hug. He was quick to crack a joke and had an unforgettable laugh. Mike would, without hesitation, lend a hand to anyone in need. He treated everyone fairly and would go above and beyond as a businessman to take good care of his customers and employees. Mike was a patient and humble man, who enjoyed seeing others succeed and be happy. He will most definitely be missed by his family and the KHHS Class of ‘77, as well as the many friends and acquaintances he had in the Melrose and Keystone Heights areas. He was preceded in death by his father, Gene Delwin Adams; mother, Emmie Katherine Chason; and infant son, Mark Chason Adams. Mike is survived by: his son, Michael B. (Lynn) Adams; and his daughter, Patricia Adams Eyster. He was a proud “Dopah” to his five grandchildren, Michael A. Adams, Chason Mckitrick, Jayden Griffis, Whitney Adams and Sayla Eyster. He is also survived by his brother, John (Patty) Adams; and his sisters, Janet (Dennis) Hall and Kathy (Mike) Fagan; as well as his precious dog, Wendy. A celebration of life will be held for Mike on Saturday, Oct. 9, from 3 p.m. until 8 p.m. at the Keystone Heights Sportsmen’s Club, located at 7180 Airport Road in Starke. The family asks for your favorite photos and memories of Mike to share in lieu of flowers. This will be a true celebration — the way Mike would want it. The family wishes to extend its gratitude to Aaron and Burney Bivens Funeral Home, 529 Kingsley Ave., Orange Park, 904-264-1233, for its services.

Matt Willhite (D-District 86) made a visit to Seagull Services on Wednesday, June 23 to talk about the Purple Alert, new legislation he co-sponsored that lets first responders know when they’re looking for an individual with cognitive or developmental disabilities. Leaders from several of Palm Beach County’s agencies that serve individuals with developmental disabilities, including the Arc of Palm Beach County and the Palm Beach Habilitation Center, gathered with those from Seagull to discuss the Purple Alert and talk with Willhite about the individuals with developmental disabilities they serve. The Purple Alert legislation, signed recently by Gov. Ron DeSantis, triggers a special alert when a person with cognitive or developmental disabilities goes missing. It covers a broad segment of individuals not covered by either the Amber Alert for endangered children or the Silver Alert for missing seniors. “This is going to fill that gap,” Willhite said. “I think it’s a big deal because it’s legislation that if someone is in trouble, every person in the State of Florida that has a cell phone can be notified.” The Purple Alert is designed to work in similar fashion to the other alert systems. While many adults with developmental disabilities, cognitive disabilities or brain injuries could be endangered if they go missing, they fall outside of the parameters for either the Amber Alert or the Silver Alert because of their ages. The Purple Alert allows first responders and the community to know that they’ll be looking for an individual with a developmental disability who may not be able to communicate clearly. “We’re honored to have Rep. Willhite visit with us and meet in person some of the individuals who could benefit from the Purple Alert,” said Michael Cowan, board chair of Seagull Services. “There’s no question that if some of our adult program participants were to wander away from their homes, their lives would be in danger, as they may not be able to ask for help or communicate well with those who could help them.” Willhite co-sponsored the legislation with State Rep. Joe Casello (D-District 90). Both men are firefighters. State Sen. Lori Berman (D-District 31) was responsible for the companion bill in the Florida Senate. Seagull Services is a private, nonprofit social service agency that is dedicated to facilitating improvement in the quality of life of developmentally challenged children and adults. In addition, it serves those who require support to overcome other social and educational barriers to success in their work and personal lives. Seagull offers advocacy and a variety of educational, social and vocational programs designed to encourage achievement, self-reliance and economic independence.

A few minutes later, she returned to an SUV idling in the street. “Another no answer,” she said to the driver, 61-year-old Kevin May. “I’m willing to bet not everyone lives here.” A recent Saturday morning found Horgan, May and 77-year-old Paul Jordan on a mission. They drove around Pasco County seeking to ferret out voter fraud that local and state election officials have affirmed doesn’t exist. Each knock presented an opportunity to find someone whose address didn’t match their voter registration — and cast doubt on Florida’s election systems. “I’m doing this because I want to give America a chance,” Jordan told a reporter. Across Florida, former President Donald Trump’s most ardent supporters are scouring communities for evidence of voter fraud. They are bombarding local elections offices with calls and emails. They are showing up wherever lawmakers are meeting, demanding an audit of last November’s presidential contest that installed Democrat Joe Biden in the White House. In Tallahassee, they emblazoned their demand on a billboard. The push for a recount began months ago in states like Arizona, where Trump lost by a narrow margin. (A much-maligned review of ballots in that state’s largest county, led by a Trump supporter, confirmed Biden’s victory.) But the movement is now bleeding into states Trump won comfortably, including Florida. This month, the Lake County Republican Party passed a resolution demanding Florida audit its election results. A state lawmaker from the same county filed a bill that would do just that. The state’s top officials, however, remain unconvinced. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Trump ally, last week reaffirmed his confidence in Florida’s 2020 result. “What we do in Florida is, there’s a pre- and post-election audit that happens automatically,” DeSantis told reporters Tuesday in St. Petersburg. “So, that has happened. It passed with flying colors.” In a statement, Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee, a DeSantis appointee who oversees state elections, said the vote tally was “accurate, transparent, and conducted in compliance with Florida law.” Republican legislative leaders also aren’t embracing calls for an election review. The speaker of the House, Chris Sprowls, has said that the election went well. A spokeswoman for Senate President Wilton Simpson didn’t respond to a request for comment. Become a Times subscriber to get our afternoon newsletter, The Rundown Want more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox? Let’s get started. Trump, who has urged election reviews in Texas, Georgia and Wisconsin, has made no mention of doing one in Florida. Surveys show that a significant number of Americans have lost trust in elections everywhere. The complicated mechanics of running an election have never been perfect. But they have become fodder for Trump supporters seeking to question the 2020 results and undermine confidence in future elections. Many of the Floridians involved in the effort are affiliated with Defend Florida, an offshoot of a national group called Defend our Union founded by conservatives after Trump’s defeat. Members of the national group talk to each other via chat rooms on Telegram: an encrypted messaging service popular in far-right circles where conspiracy theories thrive. The Tampa Bay Times reviewed thousands of Telegram messages and more than 100 emails to Tampa Bay election offices. They show the role these theories are playing in fueling the recount movement in a state that Trump won by 371,686 votes. Some emails take issue with the use of Dominion-provided voting machines, parroting a conspiracy that has sparked billion-dollar defamation lawsuits against conservative television networks. Others suggest that the vote totals were off in Florida, though amounts vary from a few hundred thousand to 1.5 million. They allege sophisticated schemes involving hacked voting software and hijacked mail-in ballots. Election supervisors say the allegations show a lack of understanding of how voting works. Mark Andersen, the Republican elections supervisor in Bay County in the Florida Panhandle, said he spent two hours on a Zoom call with representatives from Defend Florida explaining how his office makes sure vote counts are accurate. He said the group didn’t know that his county already audits every ballot. Andersen said he was open to considering evidence of fraud but he hasn’t seen any. “Show it to me, if you have it,” he said. “But if you have stuff that’s just bogus, then stop with the bogus behavior.” Floridians like Horgan, May and Jordan press on, undeterred by elections officials. “I don’t care that Trump won Florida,” May wrote in an email this month to Pasco’s supervisor of elections, Brian Corley. “We will prove he won it by far more than you say he did.” ••• Chats run by Defend Florida and Florida First Audits, the local chapter of a national organization working to force election audits in every state, have a combined 15,000 members on Telegram. It’s here that Trump supporters plot counties to target and share email addresses of lawmakers and local officials to flood with messages. They swiftly react to the latest developments in Trump’s election challenges. When DeSantis rebuffed a forensic audit in Florida, the news spread to Telegram. “Has anyone met with the governor to show the proof?” a person asked. “This speaks volumes,” said another. “We need to force it.” “Time for MASSIVE and CONTINUOUS protests in Tallahassee and wherever Gov DeSantis shows up,” added a third. "" ‘Republicans will NOT vote for an Election Integrity Denier’ should be the message.” The groups gained steam in mid-August, after Trump supporter and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell held a multi-day gathering of election skeptics to convince the world that the 2020 election was hacked. They have become a haven for the latest conspiracies and, to a lesser extent, calls for violence. “We just need an old fashioned Civil War,” one person wrote after Arizona’s audit confirmed Biden’s victory there. Moderators in these Telegram groups have struggled to beat back violent rhetoric. One told people to stop chatting about “1776 style armed revolution” and focus on audits. To which someone responded, “As of now, NOTHING we are doing is working. Time to turn up the heat, or accept being slaves.” Emails to the Pinellas, Pasco and Hillsborough elections supervisors reviewed by the Times show how quickly conspiracies spread from Telegram into lobbying. They allege dead voters, illegal voters and underage voters. They question results in counties Trump lost but also have doubts about vote totals in Pasco, Walton, Santa Rosa, Volusia and Lake counties — all GOP strongholds led by Republican election officers. “It’s like the last election didn’t end,” said Corley, who at one point changed his email signature to include the FBI tip line for reporting threats against election workers. “It’s like Groundhog Day.” They often cite the work of Lindell and his associate, Seth Keshel, who provides analysis videos and color-coded maps identifying possible problem counties. In one five-minute video, Keshel crunches some numbers and determines Biden had 30,000 more votes in Hillsborough than he should have. His evidence? His own estimates of what he thinks should have happened based on past results and party registration. Keshel doesn’t have a background in election analysis. He described himself as a tech company sales manager and former baseball analyst on his LinkedIn profile before removing it. He claimed on a conservative podcast to have advised DeSantis’ inner circle on which Florida counties to target, which the governor’s office denied. Keshel said he could not remember who he spoke with and then broke off communication with the Times. Barry Burden, an elections expert at the University of Wisconsin, called Keshel’s work “biased and amateur armchair political analytics to reach an arbitrary conclusion.” Keshel’s estimates conveniently ignored that nearly a third of Florida voters don’t have a registered party, Burden said, and his analysis falsely assumes party registration determines how someone will vote. Yet, Keshel’s video provoked the Hillsborough Republican Party to demand Lee initiate a “forensic audit” of the county’s results. But in the push for forensic audits across the state, not one person has given a clear description of what they mean and want, said Lake County’s Republican supervisor of elections, Alan Hays. “There’s no such thing I’ve found in Florida election code,” Hays said. “We have and always will continue to administer elections in this office in complete compliance with Florida statutes and the rules of the Division of Elections of the Department of State.” “Here’s the sad thing,” Hays said. “When the voters depend more on the word of a pillow salesman than they do on the word of an elections official, we’re in a bad way.” ••• The push to question election security isn’t only taking place online.

other in our lifetime. In spite of an incredibly difficult year, we all have a lot to be thankful for. Take a deep breath and think about what 2020 truly meant to you. We have experienced many impacts upon our lives that we have not witnessed before, some known and some unknown. Hearing the phase, “I never thought this would happen to us,” became commonplace. But to our credit as a people, we are resilient and committed to our way of life and our beliefs. We met the challenge of COVID-19 and its ongoing impact upon each and every part of our lives. We washed our hands, we distanced, we wore masks and we questioned whether to agree with what we were told or act upon our own instincts. Our day-to-day rituals were altered. Many enjoyments of life were denied to us. But all in all, we coped with it as best as we could. With the denial of being able to enjoy socializing, recreational events and sports at all levels, with the elections, civil unrest, racial tensions, financial concerns for the future, unemployment, the loss of many loved ones, the impact of our weather, the many changes to our school district and to education, programs and activities and work-from-home, it just seemed to keep coming and coming. Hopefully, the worst is behind us for the “roaring” 2020s decade. We look to 2021 with great hope but with the knowledge we will be guarded, as time will be needed to transition back to our normal way of life, whatever that will be. Yet 2020 can also be looked at in positive ways. Families spent more time together and enjoyed meals together at home, and we found simple and creative ways to enjoy ourselves along with getting reacquainted with our neighbors. In the true spirit of West Park, our community united and together we continued to fight this disease through the implementation of safety measures, grants for our small businesses and nonprofits; weekly food for seniors and the community at large, and assistance with childcare, mortgage, rent and utilities. The past year has been challenging for many of our Businesses. Covid-19 restrictions has limited businesses and affected retail. As businesses reopened, they were faced with abiding with limited capacity and adhering to safety precautions. I would encourage residents to frequent local businesses. I thank our police and fire employees who continue to serve West Park. This past year our first responders provided care and outstanding service through the pandemic. Our many volunteers continue to be the core of our community and offered support when needed especially during our numerous Food Distributions by serving our community in the raging heat as well as torrential rain. I would like to recognize the many talents of our staff as well as their dedication, commitment, and contributions to our city throughout the year to ensure the day to day operations continued – your efforts are appreciated. In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic affected us all differently. But we were all in this together, we supported one another and we managed. My thought for 2021 is that we experience consistent mutual respect for each other, our opinions and beliefs and redevelop the belief that we can join together to enhance relationships dedicated toward goodwill among all. With all that we experienced in 2020, let us rejoice and commit ourselves to making 2021 a year of recovery, healing, rejuvenation, good health and a genuine love of our city. As 2021 unfolds, I look forward to new beginnings for West Park. So where do we start? We are neighbors. We walk the same sidewalks, grew up here together, and dream of a vibrant city even if we prefer different paths to get there. We must listen to each other. As we enter this great civic conversation, each of us brings with us our own experiences and life stories that shape our relationship with government and our vision for West Park. Sometimes these narratives complement each other. Often they do not. One thing I know, is that we make better decisions when we show respect for all of these perspectives. Some you may agree with and others you may not. And when we disagree, I hope that we will remember that our diversity of opinion reflects the diversity of our residents. Let us govern with respect for each other and with recognition of our shared goal to help the people of West Park thrive. Of course my job is to listen to constituents, but my job is also to lead. Leading takes many forms, beginning with the basics. Leading means making sure people are safe and secure. Leading means being wise and a prudent steward of public dollars and public spaces. Leading means managing our infrastructure so that families and businesses can function and flourish. Leading often means finding the common ground when there is conflict. Our resolutions must be fair and transparent. However, being a leader is more than being a referee. Leadership is about vision. It’s about setting a compass toward a better future and forging a path wide enough for all to walk it with you. As your Mayor I will continue to listen, and seek to better understand the experiences of all who we serve. My door has always been open! Come on in! Please reach out with your ideas, suggestions, and/or concerns. Get information first hand! Remember to contact me at City Hall with your ideas, suggestions or concerns.

CLEWISTON- Expanding of employment opportunities coupled with a struggle to find workers became a common theme during the regular meeting of the Clewiston City Commission. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, “Clewiston has an unemployment rate of 8.2%. The US average is 3.7%. Clewiston has seen the job market increase by 1.4% over the last year. Future job growth over the next ten years is predicted to be 39.3%, which is higher than the US average of 33.5%.” When discussing resolution 2021-41 regarding a land purchase contract for Hato Patrero Farms, Inc. to expand their current enterprise, Commissioner Hillary Hyslope asked how many jobs would be created by the proposed expansion. City Manager Randy Martin responded by saying that the expansion projected a 20% increase in jobs, and the current workforce was made up of 60-70 employees. Commissioner Mali Gardner said while the projected increase in employment opportunities was positive, but that employers had expressed finding workers has become a struggle. She said that a business owner had reported a struggle to hire employees after a number of people went through the application and hiring process, only to decide that “their current situation with unemployment is better than going to work.” The discussion turned to question whether the wages were sufficient, but Garner was not sure if that was the case. They agreed that finding workers had become a nationwide problem, but with benefits ending, maybe it would work itself out in time. Martin said that they are working on training opportunities along with the Hendry County Economic Development Council, and that there were upcoming projects to address hiring and employment issues. The resolution was passed by unanimous consent. Next, the commissioners discussed OSGC Services, LLC. Who submittted a letter of intent, resolution 2021-42. Martin explained the company had intentions to build a 100,000 sq ft warehouse, starting with building and operation an intitial 20,000 sq ft warehouse. They project a need for 40-60 employees initially, and well over 120 employees when in full operation.

Chance of rain 40%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:59 pm James and Norma Theriault before move from Massachusetts to Homestead. People often lose contact with one another unintentionally, even if an individual holds special meaning. Norma Theriault and her older brother James lived in Homestead for a few years in the early 1980s and faced extreme financial hardship. Originally from Massachusetts, their single mother couldn’t afford housing and the two children were determined to do what they could to help. “We had a daily routine. We went to school and after school we would go to Winn Dixie to collect the carts for 5 cent green tickets. We would happily help customers unload their groceries to get the 5 cent return. We also would get tips from them. It was one of those days when we met Jeff Luabe.” Luabe worked for the South Dade News Leader in sales and at the time students could do door-to-door subscription sales that included a chance to win a trip to Disneyland. He hired James and soon after agreed to hire Norma although it was not a usual job for a girl. The impact was a major boost for them. “Our speech included a free copy of the paper and we would start off as, ‘My brother and I are trying to win a trip to Disney World and you can help us by subscribing…’, and “We worked so hard for that trip and came out on top multiple times in a row. But we never did win the trip.” The extra money given to their mother did allow them to move initially into Al’s Guest house, and later into a trailer in Florida City. Throughout this period Luabe did what he could to assist the children and was especially an inspiration to James. “This was a wonderful experience because it made us stronger and showed us anything is possible if you work hard enough,” Theriault explained. The stability didn’t last, however, as their mother remarried, moved them back to Massachusetts, and was murdered when Norma was twelve years old. She and James were separated; she to be raised by her aunt; he to Oklahoma to another relative. One advantage for Norma being in her home state was to remain in touch with Georgia Wojnar, her kindergarten teacher. She, like Jeff Luabe to James, was an inspiration to Norma as the difficult years passed. Service in the military was a way for brother and sister to start a new life and both were accustomed to hard work. James joined the Navy as soon as he could, and Norma chose the Coast Guard where her first assignment was to Fort Lauderdale. (Left) U.S. Coast Guard Boot Camp photo of Norma Theriault, and (right) U.S. Navy Boot Camp photo of James Theriault. In finding himself a single parent to his son, James completed his enlistment and re-entered civilian life to open the small company of Quality Fence and Tree Service in Massachusetts. Norma continued for a career in the Coast Guard “I always wanted to help people,” she said of selecting paths in search and rescue and law enforcement. Assignments to California, Texas, Virginia, and North Carolina as well as Florida took her around the country. Attending her brother’s second wedding brought her together again with the man who had been his best friend since childhood. There was more this time than long-term friendship and being “James’ little sister.” He and Norma married in 2009 and later had a daughter. As a new mother, she did step back a bit from the Coast Guard, was also in the Reserves, and went back into active status until 2018 when she officially retired. The family settled in Florida. but she routinely goes to Massachusetts to assist with aspects of her brother’s expanding business. Despite having lost contact with Jeff Luabe, his kindness and inspiration were important to helping them at a critical point in their young lives. She hasn’t been able to find him through regular search methods. If anyone can put them in touch, Theriault can be reached by email luvinlyf09@gmail.com Log In Keep it Clean.

Academy of Pediatrics issued recommendations Monday for the 2021-22 school year that include everyone older than age 2 wearing masks, regardless of vaccination status. The academy also ""strongly recommends"" in-person learning and urges all who are eligible be vaccinated to protect against COVID-19. AAP said it amplifies the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations for building ventilation, testing, quarantining, cleaning and disinfection in the updated guidance. Dr. Sonja O’Leary, chair of the AAP Council on School Health, said the pandemic has taken a ""heartbreaking toll"" on children. “We need to prioritize getting children back into schools alongside their friends and their teachers -- and we all play a role in making sure it happens safely,” O’Leary said. The announcement comes as new coronavirus cases are rising across the nation. Infections rose in all 50 states on Sunday for the fourth day in a row on a rolling seven-day average, an ominous run not seen since the spring 2020 surge. The weekly rolling average for cases in the United States has nearly tripled in the last month. The pace of deaths also is up sharply – 24.7% from its low point two weeks ago. It also comes as Canada is planning to reopen its borders to vaccinated Americans and guidance from both the CDC and State Department advising against traveling to the United Kingdom due to the growth of the contagious Delta variant. Fact check: COVID-19 vaccines don\'t cause magnetic reactions or contain tracking devices Also in the news: ►U.S. stocks, which had been trading at record levels in recent days, fell sharply in early trading Monday amid worries the pandemic is worsening in hotspots around the world. Global stocks also swooned. ►U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Florida, said Monday he has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus even though he was fully vaccinated. He said he is experiencing mild, flu-like symptoms. ►A federal judge is allowing Indiana University to continue with its COVID-19 vaccine requirement for all students and employees. Eight IU students who sought to block the requirement. ►Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is urging people to work from home again. Dutch infection rates shot up shortly after the government relaxed almost all lockdown measures last month, including allowing nightclubs to reopen. ►Right-wing British commentator Katie Hopkins was deported from Australia on Monday after she boasted on social media that she planned to breach quarantine rules. Hopkins was to appear in a reality television program and was in a 14-day mandatory hotel quarantine in Sydney. 📈Today\'s numbers: The U.S. has had more than 34 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 609,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The global totals: More than 190.5 million cases and 4 million deaths. More than 161.2 million Americans — 48.6% of the population – have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. 📘What we\'re reading: Cuba sent doctors abroad amid the pandemic.

U.S. citizens should avoid travel to the United Kingdom due to a spike in COVID cases, two government agencies said Monday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. State Department each raised the alert levels for the region to their highest levels. The CDC raised the travel advisory for the U.K. to a level 4, meaning ""avoid travel,\'\' citing ""very high\'\' levels of COVID-19. The alert level had been at level 3, which advised travelers to be fully vaccinated before travel to the U.K. and recommended that unvaccinated travelers avoid nonessential travel. The U.K. travel alert has been at level 3 since May. ""Because of the current situation in the United Kingdom, even fully vaccinated travelers may be at risk for getting and spreading COVID-19 variants,\'\' the CDC said in its latest travel health notice update. The United Kingdom, which encompasses England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, wasn\'t alone in being raised to level 4 by the CDC. The British Virgin Islands, Fiji, Indonesia and Zimbabwe also saw alert levels increase. – Dawn Gilbertson Canada will reopen to fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents starting Aug. 9. ""On August 9, 2021, at 12:01 a.m. EDT, fully vaccinated citizens and permanent residents of the United States (U.S.), currently residing in the U.S., will be permitted to enter Canada for discretionary (non-essential) travel,"" Canada\'s public health agency said in a statement. A COVID-19 vaccination must be complete 14 days prior to entry. Children under the age of 12 or who are not yet eligible for vaccination in the U.S. or unvaccinated dependent children will be allowed to enter the country with a fully vaccinated parent, step-parent, tutor or guardian who is eligible to enter Canada. Entry to the country will be denied to U.S. travelers who are not fully vaccinated and all other foreign nationals. Canada leads G20 countries in vaccination rates, with approximately 80% of eligible Canadians vaccinated with their first dose and over 50% of those eligible fully vaccinated. Travelers who wish to enter must have a vaccine that is accepted by the government of Canada, which includes the Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccines, and they must be able to show proof of vaccine in English or French or with a certified translation in addition to the original copy. – Morgan Hines Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said a “seasonal pattern” affecting mainly Sun Belt states is largely to blame for a recent spike in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. DeSantis, a Republican who opposes virus-related mandates, said he thinks berating or ridiculing people who have concerns about the vaccine or simply do not want it is ""not the way to reach folks."" But he said it is important for people to get vaccinated. “If you’re vaccinated and you test positive but you don’t get sick, well the name of the game is to keep people out of the hospital,” DeSantis said. “Seventy-five percent of Floridians over the age of 50 have gotten shots, so we think that’s really, really positive.” Kara Eaker, an alternate on the U.S. women\'s gymnastics team, has tested positive for COVID, coach Al Fong confirmed in a text message to USA TODAY Sports. Alternate Leanne Wong, who trains with Eaker, is also quarantining after being deemed a close contact, Fong said. Opening Ceremonies for the Games in Tokyo are set for Friday. U.S. tennis star Coco Gauff shared Sunday that she tested positive for COVID-19, announcing that she would be withdrawing from the Tokyo Olympics just days before the start of the Games. Olympic organizers revealed Sunday that three residents in the Olympic Village, including two athletes, had tested positive for COVID-19 despite initially clearing arrival protocols. A bipartisan group of criminal justice advocates are asking President Joe Biden to grant clemency and commute sentences of federal prisoners who were allowed to serve their sentences at home because of the pandemic but now face the possibility of going back to prison. Advocates have been pushing Biden to aggressively use his powers citing his campaign promise to cut the federal prison population. ""This is your opportunity to provide second chances to thousands of people who are already safely out of prison, reintegrating back to society, reconnecting with their loved ones, getting jobs and going back to school,"" stated the letter Monday from 20 advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and NAACP. Two more Democratic Texas state lawmakers who fled to Washington, D.C., to stymie passage of a restrictive, GOP-backed voting law have tested positive for COVID-19 despite being vaccinated, according to Texas House Democratic Caucus leadership. That brings the total number to five. A group of the lawmakers traveled by private plane to Washington, D.C., to lobby Congress to pass federal election reform. The lawmakers, however, drew some criticism after photos from the plane appeared to show them traveling without masks. Federal pandemic guidelines require masks to be worn on commercial flights, but not on private aircraft. More experts are calling for vaccinated people to mask up as COVID surges around the country. Almost 5,500 fully vaccinated people have been hospitalized or died from COVID-19, among the more than 160 million people who have been fully vaccinated, the CDC reports.

A pesar de esto, la pugna en el sector de los sedanes deportivos de lujo sigue vibrante, y en ese mundo nos sumergimos de la mano -o al volante para decirlo mejor- del 2021 Lexus IS. El IS es la carta de presentación de Lexus para los que les interese este segmento, pero la vetustez del modelo y la aparición de excelentes y modernos productos provenientes de Genesis, Mercedes Benz o Cadillac, están aplicando presión a Lexus para modernizar el IS. La oferta avejentada de Lexus necesita reformas para tener alguna esperanza de competir y, afortunadamente, estamos viendo cambios en el modelo 2021, que, por no ser radicales, nos dejan con el interrogante de si serán lo suficientemente profundos como para apostar por él. Lexus ha demostrado que, sin estar muchas veces a la vanguardia tecnológica en algunos de sus modelos, es capaz de perfeccionar y mejorar aquí y allá, haciendo que viejas plataformas puedan sentirse vibrantes y vitales. Creo que el 2021 IS 300 es un buen ejemplo de ello. Desde afuera y por dentro El diseño exterior por subjetivo que sea es un punto fuerte en el IS. El sedán enseña proporciones atléticas y buena postura, y no creo que nadie pueda restarle su cuota de elegancia. Lexus integra ahora las luces de circulación diurna en los faros delanteros, en lugar de colocarlos debajo o en el parachoques delantero. Los espejos laterales y las tomas de aire inferiores son nuevos, al igual que el patrón de la gran parrilla en forma de reloj de arena a la que nos hemos acostumbrado con el pasar de los años. También en los pliegues laterales antes de subir al maletero varían en el 2021, siendo ahora más pronunciados. En la parte trasera los cabios son más notables, donde las luces LED han experimentado una revisión dramática, cubriendo de lado a lado esta parte del vehículo, haciendo que la imagen posterior del IS se vea más distintiva sobre todo en la oscuridad. Quien busque un rumbo más agresivo, aún puede obtenerlo en la variante “F Sport” del IS, donde hay parachoques más agresivos y nuevas llantas de 19 pulgadas. A pesar de algunas actualizaciones para 2021, el interior del Lexus IS no se ve muy diferente al de antaño. Puede que en estilo luzca algo anticuado, pero la calidad de construcción sigue siendo impresionante. Los espacios entre paneles son uniformes y bien ceñidos y muchas superficies están cubiertas con materiales de calidad como plásticos suaves, cuero sintético y madera. El tablero ha sido rediseñado con salidas de ventilación circulares y la pantalla de información y entretenimiento de 10.3 pulgadas colocada sobre el tablero, ahora también es táctil ¡Aleluya!, por lo que no tendrá que usar constantemente el frustrante panel táctil estilo computadora portátil. La cabina también hace un gran trabajo amortiguando el ruido de la carretera y del viento, lo que resulta en una experiencia de conducción silenciosa y relajante, engrandecida por la calidad de los asientos delanteros. Aunque puede acomodar a cinco personas, el asiento trasero central trae el inconveniente de la protuberancia en el piso, generada por la barra de transmisión desde el diferencial trasero. El espacio para las piernas y en el maletero tampoco son destacables entre sus competidores. Equipamiento y seguridad Un sistema de info-entretenimiento con pantalla táctil de 8.0 pulgadas es estándar, y también utiliza un panel táctil montado en la consola que seguramente poco utilizará. Una pantalla más grande de 10,3 pulgadas con navegación es opcional. Lástima que, a pesar de incluir una pantalla táctil, la organización de los iconos sigue siendo algo embrollada, a diferencia de sistemas más modernos de la competencia. Apple CarPlay y Android Auto están incluidos, así como Amazon Alexa. En nuestra prueba la conexión y funcionamiento con Android transcurrió sin tropiezos, si descontamos la ausencia de mi aplicación favorita, Waze. Un sistema estéreo premium Mark Levinson con 17 bocinas y 1800 vatios está disponible como opción. Para 2021, el IS obtiene la versión 2.5 del conjunto de tecnologías de seguridad “Safety System Plus” de Lexus de forma estándar. El sistema de pre-colisión incluye asistencia de dirección de emergencia, advertencia de colisión frontal, frenado automático de emergencia con detección de peatones y ciclistas. Lexus asegura un mejor trabajo al detectar y responder a posibles colisiones al girar a la izquierda en el tráfico. El sistema de control de crucero adaptativo incluido funciona hasta detenerse el auto y comprobamos que hace un mejor trabajo cuando intentamos adelantar otro vehículo en la autopista. También se incluyen la advertencia de salida del carril, luces de carretera automáticas y un monitor de punto ciego con alerta de tráfico cruzado trasero. Aplaudimos el compromiso de Lexus con la seguridad, pues solo dejan de forma opcional los sensores de estacionamiento, el sistema de cámaras en 360 grados y el estacionamiento autónomo.
