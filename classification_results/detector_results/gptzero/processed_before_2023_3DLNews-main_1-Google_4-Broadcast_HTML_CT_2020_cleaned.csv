On Saturday, officers responded to a 911 call on Gilman Street for the report of a man holding two guns while standing in the middle of the street. Officers repeatedly, at least 44 times, asked the suspect, identified as Shamar Ogman, to put down the guns. According to a preliminary status report of investigation from State’s Attorney Margaret Kelley, Ogman failed to comply with the requests to drop the weapon. In the body camera video, it appears that he points the rifle in the direction of the officers. At that time, Officer Ashley Martinez fired one shot and struck Ogman. Officers immediately began providing medical treatment. Ogman was taken to Hartford Hospital where he died from his injuries. Body camera videos from Officers Christopher Larson, Ashley Martinez, and Joseph Walsh were released at the direction of the state’s attorney’s office. Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin and Hartford Chief of Police Jason Thody had urged Kelley to release the body camera videos as soon as possible. Following the release of the body camera footage, Bronin released a statement saying, “I want to thank the State’s Attorney for quickly releasing footage of this tragic incident,” said Mayor Bronin. “The videos released today show a very dangerous situation, with a heavily-armed man aiming a rifle at police officers in a residential neighborhood. Any loss of life in our community is painful, and our hearts go out to the family of Mr. Ogman. My thoughts are also with Officer Martinez. No officer ever wants to face a situation like this, and she acted to protect her fellow officers and the public when she felt that she had no other responsible choice.” Martinez has been with the department for four years. “You want to protect yourself, protect your fellow officers and the civilians who may be in the area,” WFSB law Enforcement Analyst Lt. J. Paul Vance said Tuesday. After watching the video, it appears officers asked Ogman at least 44 times to put the gun down. “They would say it 100 times if they could get that person to disarm themselves,” Vance said. Vance analyzed two things leading up to the gunshot. First, the officers distance from the suspect, which appears to be at least 20 yards away. “The distance that can be covered with those tools that the suspect has in their possession is massive, it’s large,” he said. He also explains Officer Ashley Martinez’s movements seconds before firing. “She made the weapon ready, she certainly was observant if you will of all the area around her the best she could see,” Vance said. State police and the state’s attorney’s office is still investigating, but ultimately Vance believes the shooting was justified. “I think the officer unfortunately had to do her duty,” Vance said. The Hartford Police Union released a statement saying, “Officer Ashley Martinez is a 4-year veteran of the Hartford Police Department. In that time Officer Martinez has been assigned to the Patrol Division and is currently assigned to the Intelligence Division. Officer Martinez has excelled at identifying Violent Offenders. Officer Martinez is devoted to serving the citizens of Hartford. On Saturday December 26th, 2020, Officer Martinez’s heroic actions saved the lives of innocent citizens and her fellow officers. The Hartford Police Union and all our members stand by Officer Ashley Martinez and her actions on the night of December 26th, 2020.” Copyright 2022 WFSB. All rights reserved.'}]"
