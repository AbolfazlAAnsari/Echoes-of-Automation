Born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, Seuss attended Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, where he adopted the playful “Doctor” prefix, according to his 1991 New York Times obituary. It remained a pen name as an in-joke referring to his father’s undying wish for him to do something “serious” like study medicine. Not only can the father Seuss take pride in the fact that his son lit up the faces of countless children over his six-decade career, but he may have also been a secret member of New Hampshire’s DeLorean time travel club. There are several instances where it seems Dr. Seuss peered into a crystal ball and magically predicted the future. Most notably, his short story The Sneetches. In it, a group of creatures (Sneetches) who live in the same area (beaches) are visited by a man with a machine that can print stars on their bellies. This leads to a heated dispute between Sneetches with and without stars about which group is “superior.” For extra money, you can add an extra star. And for even more money, you can pay to have your star removed. Remind you of anything? Because to me, that traveling salesman who visited the beach sounds a lot like the guy running a website called Twitter right now. It’s just one of many examples where Seuss was prophetic, with many forecasting notable stories right here in New England.'}]"

In this crowded field, Vancouver-based Filament Health has a unique approach: extracting drugs like psilocybin and mescaline from natural sources, including mushrooms and cacti, rather than synthesizing the ingredients in a laboratory. Filament is studying its mushroom-based psilocybin as a treatment for opioid and stimulant use disorder. And more than a dozen other companies and academic centers are using the company’s drugs in trials of depression, chronic pain and other disorders. Filament CEO Benjamin Lightburn spoke with The Associated Press about the ethical, therapeutic and medical case for using naturally derived psychedelics. The answers have been edited for length and clarity. Q: What do you mean by “natural psychedelics” and how are they produced? A: It means we’re deriving them from natural sources, like plants and fungi, because that is in fact the way that humanity has been interacting with these substances in their natural form for thousands of years. It’s only recently that we had access to synthetic chemical manufacturing techniques. Since our products come from natural sources, we believe it allows people to maintain a certain connection to how humans have been ingesting these substances for years and years and to important aspects of many traditional communities. A natural product contains much more than just one single active compound, right? And so in the case of magic mushrooms, for instance, they contain much more than just psilocybin. They contain other compounds like psilocin and a dozen or more other active ingredients. Just like when you drink a cup of coffee there is much more than just caffeine. There’s a whole entourage of different compounds, which in the case of coffee gives it a flavor, aroma and terroir. Q: Do you think patients will be able to tell the difference when they take these drugs? A: It’s our hypothesis that the presence of these other compounds may contribute to differences or perhaps even improvements in the therapeutic potential of these complex natural mixtures. After all, these substances did evolve in nature alongside humans. Q: Your company also prioritizes ethically and sustainably harvesting these plants. How does that work? A: The iboga plant, which contains the psychedelic ibogaine, is probably the best example of that at Filament. We’ve been working with groups in West Africa, in Gabon, where the iboga plant is indigenous and, in fact, is also involved with important cultural practices by the Bwiti people. So it’s very important for us to make sure that any source of supply that’s being imported from overseas, it’s being done sustainably, No. 1, of course. And No. 2, that the proper procedures for informed consent with the local indigenous community are put in place and procedures for reciprocity and equitable benefit sharing. We obviously believe in sharing the benefit of any commercial products that get manufactured back with the local community who, after all, have been stewarding and shepherding this cultural resource for the previous millennia. Q: What is the advantage of all of these practices when there are so many competitors in the psychedelic space? A: We’re really the only one that is focused 100% on natural. And we’ve actually been able to successfully manufacture these products and get them into clinical trials. There is a ton of interest from different researchers all around the world to use our psychedelic drugs. And there’s a lot of interest, I think, from the investment community to fund our own internal drug development. If you believe psychedelics are a thing that’s going to be here to stay and you believe that people are going to at least want a choice to have a natural psychedelic product, then I think it’s fair to say that Filament is going to be sticking around for the long haul. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

They fear the vibrant person they knew has been lost in the chaos of Simpson\'s murder trial, the questions it raised about race in America and the headlines spawned by his recent death. 1 day ago in Entertainment The four members of the Swedish pop quartet ABBA, who triumphed at the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest with the peppy love song ""Waterloo,"" on Friday got one of the most prestigious knighthoods in Sweden from the Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf. 2 days ago in Lifestyle, Trending If you use Facebook, WhatsApp or Instagram, you\'ve probably noticed a new character pop up answering search queries or eagerly offering tidbits of information in your feeds, with varying degrees of accuracy. 96.5 Live Free CountryCopyright 2024 Saga Communications, Inc.

He was the one bank robber we could pull for; New England’s Al Capone. But back to the bears. Maybe we should call the zoo in China and offer them some of ours, as the region has seen an uptick in encounters between real bears and astonished humans. We had one bear go on a binge at a bakery, another tried to steal a vehicle, and a family of bears was caught on camera trying to take up golf. Bonus: that was just this year.
