The annual average is about 50. The weather service said Iowa has never seen this many tornadoes by this date, which places this year among the top five deadliest tornado seasons, with six dead — including four in Greenfield — and roughly three-dozen injured. There is still a month left in the tornado season, though twisters can strike during any month. In Dec. 2021, Iowa had a record 63 tornadoes in a single day. That was during the state’s second derecho in as many years. That December outbreak set another record for most EF-2 tornadoes in one day, at 21. Iowa’s worst-ever day for deadly tornadoes was May 15, 1968, when the state saw five massive F-5 tornadoes that killed 18 people. By John Wanamaker Iowans may have had someone come to their door this spring, offering to inspect their roof for hail damage and help with an insurance claim for replacement. While it might be tempting, Iowa Insurance Commissioner Doug Ommen advises Iowans to take the time to consider whether or not to file a claim, especially if their roof is relatively new, or near the end of its projected lifespan. “They can’t, by law, cancel you for a replacement. But when it comes time for re-underwriting, those are things to be aware of. Because especially in a tight market like where we are now, I’d hate to see consumers have a roof replaced that they don’t need only a couple years from now not pass underwriting and lose their coverage.” Ommen says there are parts of a house, like roofs and siding, that need regular maintenance. If these items are at or near their projected lifespan, they should be replaced. Severe weather events are becoming more common in the last five years, and home insurance premiums are at record levels. Some carriers have stopped writing policies in Iowa and other Midwestern states, which has led to more people foregoing insurance coverage. The Insurance Information Institute estimates 12% of homeowners nationwide had no insurance in 2022, up from just 5% in 2019. Ommen said that worries him. “Some of us could say well, it’ll pass if we get back to what is a normal business cycle, but in the meantime, we’re still at risk of pretty catastrophic losses due to tornadoes. Those people that have gone bare or are underinsured, those are the folks that keep me up at night. I worry a lot about that.” Iowa’s FAIR Plan Association provides basic coverage to qualified applicants who are unable to find insurance in the voluntary insurance market, but Ommen says it won’t come near covering replacement of a home. By Sheila Brummer Voters will cast their ballots in primary elections in Iowa on Tuesday. The Republican primary for the 4th Congressional District pits political newcomer Kevin Virgil against incumbent Randy Feenstra. David Peterson, a professor of political science at Iowa State University who works and lives in the 4th District, said it would be “shocking” if Feenstra doesn’t win the primary. “Feenstra is a well-known Republican who has worked his way up to the state party and was sort of handpicked by a lot of the leading Republicans in the state to challenge King a few cycles ago. He's done the things that a member of Congress is supposed to do.” Both sides have bashed the other. Campaign mailers from Feenstra question Virgil’s loyalty to Iowa, saying he hasn’t voted in the state since 1992. Virgil tells anyone who will listen that Feenstra isn’t conservative enough and votes against the Constitution. The winner of the contest between Feenstra and Virgil will face Democrat Ryan Melton in November. The insurance supervisor from Nevada doesn’t have a challenger for the primary. During the general election in 2022, he lost to Feenstra by almost 40 points. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on primary day. Read the full story. By Natalie Krebs Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird says her office will resume reimbursing emergency contraception for rape victims under the state’s sexual abuse examination payment program. When Bird took office in January last year, she paused reimbursements for emergency contraception under the program. Her office conducted a 16-month audit of victim services. Bird says following the audit’s conclusion, her office will reimburse all pending claims for emergency contraception. “I want to make it clear that not one victim was denied services due to the audit. Not one victim was delayed in receiving services due to the audit.” Bird says her office will no longer reimburse abortion requests for victims under the program. Following the audit, Bird says her office plans to reinstate a system that notifies victims when a protection order has expired and is proposing to double pay for sexual assault nurse examiners. By Grant Leo Winterer A laborshed study is underway in northeast Iowa to identify strengths and weaknesses in the area’s labor force. The study is an Iowa Workforce Development initiative, and will look at regional salaries, gaps in various sectors, and commute times to get a clearer picture of what the Cedar Valley needs to grow its workforce. Lisa Rivera Skubal, Vice President for Economic Development at Grow Cedar Valley, said the survey could be the first true gauge of the labor force after the pandemic. “The period between 2021 and now has really changed a lot. It’s going to be interesting to see what that looks like, what’s on the mind of the workforce, but also what employers are thinking as well.” Eight northeast Iowa counties will be canvassed, with results expected by the end of the summer. By Rachel Cramer The USDA said there may be help available for farmers affected by recent tornadoes and floods. Several USDA programs offer financial support for losses, including livestock deaths and damage to operations with honeybees, farm-raised fish and orchards. Other programs provide technical assistance to restore farmland or forests, and to remove debris. Impacted producers can contact their local USDA Service Center to report losses and learn more about program options. For assistance with a crop insurance claim, producers and landowners should contact their crop insurance agent. By Grant Gerlock Some top Republicans in Iowa expressed their continued support for Donald Trump after Thursday’s verdict from a New York jury made him the first former president to be convicted of a felony. Trump was convicted on all 34 counts related to falsifying records to keep an alleged affair out of the news during the 2016 presidential election. In a statement, Gov. Kim Reynolds echoed Trump, calling the trial a “sham” and said the only verdict that matters will come at the ballot box in November. Second District Rep. Ashley Hinson said in a social media post the trial was a disgrace. She posted a link to a fundraising website that calls Trump a political prisoner. State Auditor Rob Sand, a Democrat, said the jurors in the Trump case deserve respect, and added that juries he has dealt with in both liberal and conservative areas took the work seriously. By Farah Yousry The latest national abortion count by the Society of Family Planning has found the number of abortions in the U.S. increased last year compared to 2022. The WeCount report looked at abortions over 18 months – between April 2022 and Dec. 2023. It reflects abortions provided in a health care setting, including in-person and virtual care. It does not reflect abortions done outside of the system, like self-managed abortions. The state that saw the largest surge in abortion volume was Illinois, with more than 35,000 extra abortions over the 18-month period. Another takeaway of the report is a surge in the number of abortions provided under shield laws. These laws protect clinicians in several states like New York, Massachusetts and Colorado, who provide telehealth abortions to people who live in states with abortion restrictions or bans. Between Oct. and Dec. 2023, there were an average of nearly 8,000 monthly telehealth abortions provided under shield laws. Read the full story from Side Effects Public Media. By O. Kay Henderson State officials say phone and internet services provided by Lumen Technologies have been disrupted in Iowa due to a water line break at the company’s hub in Des Moines Thursday morning. CenturyLink changed its name to Lumen in 2020 and the extent of the company’s outage is unclear. A spokesperson for Lumen says central and eastern Iowa customers are affected. According to the Iowa Department of Homeland Security, some Lumen customers may not be able to call 911 with their landline phone, so the agency is recommending emergency calls be made from a cell phone if a landline call doesn’t go through. An advisory from Polk County Emergency Management indicates Lumen has brought in generators to try to stabilize the situation at its hub in downtown""}]"

Since then, Anderson has been a staple in the Forest City softball lineup, collecting over 80 hits and batting over .360 for her career with one summer left to go.

Still, you can tell by the number of teammates from multiple sports who showed up to support her during the signing process that she is well-respected amongst her peers – Anderson was appreciative of the support. Playing sports in college runs in the family. Anderson’s sister, Hannah, played basketball at NCAA DIII Wartburg, and Brother, Tyler, played NCAA DII football at Winona State University. She doesn’t know precisely what Central will use her for, which is a credit to her; she has played many different positions while at Forest City and has the ability to impact them with defense or on the bases. Anderson is 41 for 41 in her career, stealing bases with over 80 runs scored. Defensively, in all those games she’s played, she has committed just 20 errors, including only three last year while playing in 22 games.

According to the report, 12.6% of high school students reported using tobacco products compared to 16.5% the year before. 10% reported using e-cigarettes compared to 14.1% the year before. Middle school students reported a slight increase in using tobacco products, going up from 4.5% last year to 6.6.%. “The decline in e-cigarette use among high school students shows great progress, but our work is far from over,” said Deirdre Lawrence Kittner, Ph.D., M.P.H., director of CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health. “Findings from this report underscore the threat that commercial tobacco product use poses to the health of our nation’s youth. It is imperative that we prevent youth from starting to use tobacco and help those who use tobacco to quit.” E-cigarettes have been the most commonly used tobacco product for both middle and high school students. Of active tobacco users, 9 out of 10 reported using e-cigarettes. Officials say that multiple factors continue to influence youth tobacco product use, including flavors, marketing, and misperceptions of harm. You can find more information at the link here.

She was being held on a $12,000 bond in the Page County Jail. **”All charges are merely accusations and the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty in a court of law.”** Posted in News | News AMES, Iowa – Nov. 2, 2023 – People are dying on Iowa roads at alarming rates. Traffic fatalities in our state this year are more than 13 percent higher than the average number of fatalities over the last five years. One of the keys to reducing fatalities and major crashes is to bring awareness to the problem. The Iowa departments of transportation and public safety, along with support from local law enforcement partners, are teaming up to create safety corridors across the state. Using 2016-2020 crash data, six sections of roadways have been identified for focus over the next year: These areas ranked in the top one percent statewide for all crashes and severe crashes. They also had a higher number of single-vehicle, run-off-the-road crashes and rear-end crashes at intersections with speeding and distraction as major causes. Iowans may notice the safety corridor marked with signs. Pavement markings in those areas have been widened to help drivers more easily see them in low-light and inclement weather. In addition, the Iowa State Patrol and local law enforcement will have an increased focus on enforcing the area. Education and communication efforts throughout the year will help remind drivers that practicing good driving behaviors can make the area safer. “We have seen speeds and distraction behind the wheel rise and only 40 percent of those who die on Iowa’s roads are wearing a seatbelt. Unfortunately, our state’s climbing fatality rates are showing the consequences of our individual decisions behind the wheel. We all have someone who is expecting us to return from each trip safely. Creating safety corridors is just another way the DOT can help remind drivers of the role they play in making sure everyone returns home safely,” explained Scott Marler, Iowa Department of Transportation director. “The Iowa State Patrol is committed to reducing traffic collisions, injuries, and preventable deaths on Iowa roadways. We are confident that we can accomplish these goals with collaboration, strong partnerships, and a concerted effort on traffic safety. By working together, we can collectively and proactively address safety concerns across the state of Iowa,” remarked Colonel Nathan Fulk, Iowa State Patrol.

activities for their classrooms during March, with a focus on food and agriculture. Professor Constance Beecher, in Iowa State University’s School of Education, organizes the annual effort, which has reached some 72-thousand young Iowans in all 99 counties just in the few years it’s been around. “It’s really a month-long celebration, kind of a public service campaign, about the importance of reading,” Beecher says, “and especially thinking about the links between reading and agriculture in our state.” In the next few weeks, volunteers will pack up one-thousand book kits to ship out to hundreds of teachers statewide. Teachers were able to sign up for the give-a ways online starting in mid-January and already, all one-thousand kits have been snapped up. “We don’t have a budget for this,” Beecher says. “It’s all sort of goodwill. We go out and try to get grants and so we landed on 1,000 books just as a nice round number of what we thought we could raise some money for, so it’s basically a first come-first serve basis.” While the free books are gone, she says teachers can still get the lesson plans and other elements of the program on the website. Beecher, who’s the family literacy state specialist through Human Sciences Extension and Outreach, says it’s vital to read to young children for language and literacy development, and the program is helping students to reach new heights. “We’ve changed the theme each year to make it fun and interesting,” Beecher says. “So, last year we had a farm-to-table theme. This year, our theme is food science, so we’re really looking at the science of different kinds of food.” Continuing with this year’s food science theme, several of the books focus on topics like bread baking, making ice cream and turning grapes into jelly. They’re accompanied by links to simple recipes and video recordings with the authors. “One of our books is called ‘Bread Lab’ and it was written by people who actually work in the bread lab at Washington State University,” Beecher says. “Kids might not realize that there’s so much science behind recipes and developing food and food safety and that there’s all these really great careers.” The I-S-U Extension is also partnering with Iowa 4-H and the Iowa Agriculture Literacy Foundation on the program.

Posted in Weather | News (Radio Iowa) – Iowa Senator Joni Ernst is joining other Republicans in the U-S Senate who’re calling for an investigation of how the Biden Administration has handled changes in the Free Application for Federal Student Aid — called FAFSA. “The Department of Education wasted time on a lot of socialist schemes and taxpayer funded handouts,” Ernst says. “What we need is transparency for Iowa families and that’s why I’m demanding an investigation.” An estimated 17 million college-bound students who filled out FAFSA forms will have to wait for financial aid offers from schools. That’s because the data in those forms is normally delivered to colleges and universities in the late fall or early winter, but this year’s delivery is now expected in March. It means students likely won’t find out until April how much federal financial aid they qualify for and how much their college of choice might offer in scholarships. “The Biden Department of Education’s botched roll out forced uncertainty this school year,” Ernst says. A federal law passed in late 2020 called for simplifying the FAFSA form. Ernst says it has led to an unfair calculation of a farm family’s ability to come up with the money to pay for a child’s college education. “Their folks have farm ground, they have equipment, so they’re asset rich, but they are cash poor,” Ernst said, “and these ag families should not be forced to sell their farm so that their children can go to college.” Ernst says the Biden Administration should have taken action to change the income, asset and debt calculator in the FAFSA for farm families. Last March,, Ernst sent the U-S Education Secretary a letter, saying the Iowa College Aid Commission had calculated that students from some farm families will see a significant drop in the amount of federal aid they may receive. Last April, Ernst co-sponsored a bill that would have addressed the issue. Posted in News | News (Radio Iowa) – Governor Kim Reynolds has introduced a bill that would require the gender listed on an Iowa driver’s license or birth certificate to match the person’s gender at birth — preventing transgender residents from changing the gender listed on those I-Ds. Reynolds says women and men have unique biological differences and the move will protect women’s health, safety, and privacy in'}]"

Two locally-owned restaurants reached out to WHO 13 News to express to the public that they are going in new directions. “Well, if you’re paying attention, you understand that any of those kinds of market forces can have an impact before you even step foot in the place and I anticipated that,” said Tony Konecne, the owner of The Pelican Post in West Des Moines. “All businesses that are successful think forward and that’s what we do, we don’t spend a whole lot of time looking at the past, we’re thinking forward.” The Pelican Post and Who’s on First in Ankeny both were re-branded and remodeled. Both came under new ownership in 2023 and the owners said the first couple of months went well, but the realization of a potential negative narrative about the building could be hurting foot traffic. “We kind of had our honeymoon period where we had a lot of our friends and family really supporting us on a regular basis, coming in more often then they normally would, so we kind of got used to that,” said Aaron McCombs, co-owner of Who’s on First. “And as we got to about month three, month four, we kind of settled in and started to see what the numbers looked like. And we were kind of asking people why the decline? And there was just a lot of negativity and some things that we weren’t fully aware.” McCombs owns the restaurant with a lifelong friend, Jason Schomer. Both touted their fresh food, service and new looks all as reasons to come check them out.'}]"
