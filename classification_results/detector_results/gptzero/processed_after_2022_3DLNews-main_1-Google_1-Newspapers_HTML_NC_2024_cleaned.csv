RALEIGH — The former state auditor of North Carolina, Beth Wood, never lost an election. She clinched the Democratic primary for the elected office in 2008, defeated a Republican incumbent that fall, and then won reelection in 2012, 2016 and 2020. Wood never lost an election — but she did lose her job, thanks to a series of disastrous decisions that began with a hit-and-run incident in December 2022 and ended with her resignation from the post a year later. Jessica Holmes, an attorney who formerly chaired the Wake County Board of Commissioners, was appointed by Gov. Roy Cooper to replace Wood, and will stand for election this fall. Six Republicans are vying for the chance to displace Holmes from the office of state auditor, one of the 10 elected executives who form North Carolina’s Council of State. The state auditor conducts financial and performance audits of state and local agencies and departments. Although not necessarily a high-profile office, it’s one of the most important in state government — and is best held by an independent-minded leader, not a partisan loyalist or glad-hander eager for higher office. Charles Dingee is a small-business owner and activist who previously chaired the Wake County Young Republicans and the 13th District GOP. He says his commitment to fiscal responsibility, openness, and public service make him the strongest candidate for state auditor. Dingee pledges to “work tirelessly to ensure that government agencies are transparent in their operations, and that all financial transactions are open to public scrutiny.” A former member of the Greensboro City Council, Jim Kee has worked as a farmer, real-estate developer, sales manager, and nonprofit director. “Community service has always been a passion for me,” Kee says. “With two terms of city council experience, I understand what it takes to find solutions, how important it is to work together and navigate the complicated governmental agencies to help get things done.” Another candidate in the race is Anthony Wayne Street, who goes by Tony.

Read more April 24, 2024 Lately, there’s been a lot of talk about relationships in real estate transactions and who works for whom, so we thought we’d take a few minutes to clarify the relationships that REALTORS have with the public. Breaking it down as simply as possible, let’s talk about three separate types of relationship types: the Consumer, the Customer, and the Client.The term Consumer is actually an umbrella term that covers both Customer and Client. It can mean Buyer or Seller, Landlord or Tenant, someone looking to buy or sell today or a year from now. In short, the Consumer is a member of the public that has or may have an interest in the real estate market now, or at some time in the future. To be extremely simple, we can say a member of the public who is eligible to purchase real estate is considered a Consumer.

Robert Kennedy Jr.\'s presidential ambitions resulted in public family drama after a political action committee aired a Super Bowl ad invoking the Democratic family\'s legacy to implicitly compare the independent candidate to his assassinated uncle, President John F. Kennedy. The 30-second spot, financed by the American Values 2024 Super PAC that is backing Kennedy, featured a shortened version of a campaign song that the 35th president used in his 1960 campaign. The spot also mimicked cartoon and newsreel effects using black-and-white pictures of Robert Kennedy Jr. similar to JFK. But in a notable departure from the Kennedy\'s bygone Democratic Party dynasty, the ad urged Americans to ""Vote Independent."" After the game, Kennedy responded to online criticism, including from one of his cousins, emphasizing that his campaign did not produce the spot, which cost an estimated $7 million. ""I\'m so sorry if the Super Bowl advertisement caused anyone in my family pain,"" Kennedy wrote late Sunday night on social media. ""The ad was created and aired by the American Values Super PAC without any involvement or approval from my campaign. … I love you all. God bless you."" Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks Nov. 14 during a campaign event in Columbia, S.C. Still, as of Monday morning, Kennedy had the ad pinned to the top of his X profile. ""Our momentum is growing,"" he wrote. ""It\'s time for an Independent President to heal the divide in our country."" Bobby Shriver, whose mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founded the Special Olympics, hammered his cousin over the spot and his opposition to vaccines for COVID-19 and other diseases. ""My cousin\'s Super Bowl ad used our uncle\'s faces- and my Mother\'s,"" Shriver wrote. ""She would be appalled by his deadly health care views. Respect for science, vaccines, & health care equity were in her DNA."" Shriver, whose father, Sargent Shriver, founded the Peace Corps, also alluded to his own work in expanding health care access in the developing world. Robert Kennedy Jr. responded separately to his cousin: ""Bobby. I\'m so sorry if that advertisement caused you pain. … I send you and your family my sincerest apologies. God bless you."" Cheryl Hines, left, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrive Jan. 30 to the ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" final season premiere at the DGA Theater in Los Angeles. Kennedy is running for president as an independent despite his family\'s status as Democratic Party nobility. It\'s not yet clear whether he can gain ballot access in enough states to mount a true national campaign. But his effort comes in a year when many voters are not enthusiastic about the likelihood of a rematch between President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and former President Donald Trump, a Republican. Any independent or third-party efforts in battleground states could shape the outcome in unpredictable ways. ""It is fitting that the first national ad promoting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\'s candidacy was bought and paid for by Donald Trump\'s largest donor this cycle,"" said Democratic National Committee spokesman Alex Floyd. He was referring to Tim Mellon, a major donor to Trump who also gave American Values $15 million last year, according to federal filings. The DNC already filed a federal complaint alleging that Kennedy\'s campaign is illegally coordinating with American Values to siphon support from Biden, an accusation the PAC denies. A Biden campaign spokesman sidestepped the flap, instead highlighting the president\'s Super Bowl Sunday debut on the social media platform TikTok. The crowd waits for Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy to speak at a Feb. 4 campaign stop at Area 15 in Las Vegas. An email newsletter from American Values framed the ad as an unqualified success, noting a spike in online searches for Kennedy and a statement from his campaign spokeswoman saying the campaign was ""pleasantly surprised and grateful"" for the ad, a different tone than Kennedy\'s statements to his family. At one time, Kennedy was a leading environmental activist, and he was among the younger Kennedy family members who would speak at Democratic Party conventions and events. He has in recent years delved into conspiracy theories and become a face of the anti-vaccine movement. Besides his presidential uncle, who was assassinated in 1963, Kennedy\'s political lineage includes his father, who was U.S. attorney general, a senator from New York and leading presidential candidate at the time of his 1968 assassination. His father\'s longest-lived brother was Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. Sargent Shriver, Bobby Shriver\'s father, ran for president in 1976 as a Democrat.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 2:52 am In a mid-December 2023 column about Allison and John Gahrmann’s Lincolnton B&B White Rose Manor, I listed some of the noteworthy guests who’d stayed with the Gahrmanns over the past several years. Among them were John and Shyral Hyatt, who at the time lived in Atlanta but have since moved to St. Louis, Missouri. They were in Lincolnton for John’s participation in a reenactment of the American Revolution’s Battle of Ramsour’s Mill. In the story, I promised to offer more information about John, the reason for his interest in this important battle, and what it’s like being a reenactor. First, we corresponded by email. John stated, “I am a descendent of James Gilmore (5th great grandfather) who fought in the American Revolution under Colonel Francis Locke. James Gilmore lived in Lincoln County at the time of the battle. He had been captured and paroled at Charleston and returned home around the first of June, 1780. The Battle of Ramsour’s Mill occurred on June 20th, and it seems likely that James Gilmore was a participant although we do not have proof at this time.” Then John and I communicated by phone as he’s living in St. Louis, working as a regional security manager for U.S. Bank. Before we talked about the Battle of Ramsour’s Mill, he pointed out that the westernmost battle of the American Revolution took place in St. Louis, a bit of information that added to my firm belief that John truly loves history and knows it well, especially related to the Revolutionary War. Furthermore, he’s participated in not one but two reenactments of the Battle of Ramsour’s Mill. I wondered about John’s comment in his email that James Gilmore had been “paroled at Charleston.” John explained, “When Charleston fell May 12, 1780, the British captured the entire American army of the Southern Campaign under General Benjamin Lincoln.” Meaning the British had thousands of prisoners to deal with. Among them was James Gilmore. John said there was no way the British could accommodate the lot, so they allowed many to return home if they promised “to sit out the war.” “[James Gilmore] did not,” John emphasized. “Most of them did not.” The reason being that the British hadn’t kept their word, so the Patriots didn’t either. John offered the massacre at Waxhaws as an example of British betrayal. When the Patriots laid down their arms in surrender, they were slaughtered. Further breaking the British deal of parole was when Patriot prisoners were told they had to sign up and fight for the British Crown. So, James Gilmore felt no compunction in disobeying the British parole directives. Speaking about the Patriots’ defeat at Charleston, John wrote in an email, “It was the most terrible defeat in the course of the war. Due to the destruction of the American army and the capture of the most important American port south of New York, many believed that the American cause was lost. The British believed that the South would now easily acquiesce to royal authority and that the rebellion would be rolled up as the British army attacked north from Virginia and the Carolinas.” Pride goeth before a great big fall, though, doesn’t it? And that big thud took place in our own neck of the North Carolina woods: the Battle of Ramsour’s Mill, the first major action of the American Revolution after the fall of Charleston and the Battle of Waxhaws in Lancaster County, South Carolina. Back to John talking on the phone: “At Ramsour’s Mill, it was neighbor fighting neighbor. In some cases, brother fighting brother. It was truly a civil war. Most had no uniforms at all.” In a nutshell, a bunch of loyalists, most plain farmers, serving under Lt. Col. William Moore, British commander in the South, gathered at Ramsour’s Mill to train. Moore had been instructed by Lt. Gen. Lord Charles Cornwallis to recruit loyalists but not to bring them together in one location, to wait until things were organized. Moore, having heard that Patriots were organizing for the purpose of thwarting his efforts, decided to go ahead and rally his approximately 1300 men at Ramsour’s Mill on Clarke’s Creek. Nearly a fourth of them didn’t have guns. A much smaller group, the Patriots learned about the gathering and attacked. “The 400 Patriots were equipped and ready to fight,” said John. “The loyalists, poorly equipped, lacked experience. [The Patriots] approached camp and were spotted. Sentries fired on them. Both sides heard shooting and moved toward it. It was a bloody, confused battle. Hand-to-hand combat. So many died. They didn’t know who was Patriot and who was Loyalist, so the dead were all dumped together in a big hole.” In the end, though, the Loyalists were soundly defeated. John called the battle “the decisive campaign of the revolution. It bought us our freedom.” In an email, John wrote, “[The victory] put new life into the cause of American freedom. After this battle and a blunder by the British in altering terms of parole for the Americans, the flames of revolution ignited across the southern colonies resulting in a bloody and savage civil war between Whigs and Tories. This struggle led directly to the defeat of the British at Yorktown and American independence.” “We wore the British army out” said John, who’s a member of the Sons of the American Revolution and a person who’s conducted extensive genealogical research about his ancestors, including a second forefather, George Cowan, who lived in Lincoln County and fought in the war, and “is even more likely to have fought at Ramsour’s Mill,” John suggested As part of the Sons of the American Revolution and the New Acquisition Militia, John participated in the reenactments at Ramsour’s Mill. To prepare for this and other reenactments, John does research about equipment, clothing, and gear appropriate to the times and events. He decides the character he’d like to represent. “Someone from the Continental line looks very different from someone serving in the militia,” he stated. “I normally present myself as a member of the militia.” John described the militia as men wearing “hunting shirts, leggings, frequently moccasins due to lack of shoes, and hats of which there were a variety of cocked hats because of one corner being cocked up. Some wore feathers in their hats, some deer tails, some items to signify their units.” “Specifically used at Ramsour’s Mill,” John went on, “were pieces of white paper in the hats to indicate they were Patriots. Loyalists indicated their status by using little pieces of pine branches in their hats.” I can imagine hats flying off, clothing torn and dirtied by the efforts of up-close combat. It’s easy to understand how all combatants – Loyalists and Patriots – looked the same as the struggle wore on. As for John’s weapon of choice during reenactments, he carries a rifle rather than a musket. He explained the pros and cons of the sort of rifle used during the American Revolution. It was accurate and fired from a great distance, but it took a minute to load and a bayonet couldn’t be attached to it. Especially during our phone conversations, I sensed much excitement in John’s voice about the war, much conviction that the determined, freedom-seeking Patriots of the South, at Ramsour’s Mill in particular, directly and indirectly secured American freedom. “It’s something for the people of Lincolnton to be proud of,” he concluded.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'A special election in the suburbs of New York to replace disgraced former Rep. George Santos could offer clues about the mindset of suburban voters everywhere as 2024 election contests ramp up across the country. The Tuesday contest for the House seat held by Santos until his recent expulsion is shaping up to be a bellwether in the fight for control of Congress, as candidates test political messages their parties hope will appeal to suburban voters in the fall. It not only could subtract one more vote from Republicans’ narrow majority in the short run but will be monitored carefully for any signals it sends about what suburban voters elsewhere may be thinking entering the highly volatile 2024 election year. The Long Island race pits former U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi, a Democrat who represented the district for three terms before quitting to run for governor, against Republican nominee Mazi Pilip, a county legislator. The seat, which represents suburbs just east of New York City plus a small part of Queens, became vacant after Santos was expelled from the House late last year after getting charged with multiple counts of fraud and stealing from donors. While the Santos scandal gives the race a unique backstory, the candidates have campaigned on issues that could be aimed at suburban voters anywhere, with Republicans hammering away on immigration and crime while Democrats cast themselves as the last line of defense on abortion rights. Tuesday’s special election gives both parties an opportunity to assess strategies for November’s general election, when New York is expected to be a battleground in the fight for control of the House, where Republicans now hold a thin majority. “It’s a bellwether for the rest of the country, in that candidates and political operatives are looking at the strategies and tactics and the messaging to see how it’ll play out in their swing suburbs,” said Larry Levy, dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University on Long Island. “February 13th is really about November 5th, and swing suburban districts all over the country.” The district itself could potentially wind up being reshaped before the November election because of a lingering battle over redistricting in New York, making its status as a measure of voter sentiment in a district that hasn’t changed yet especially interesting. Pilip entered the race with an intriguing personal story. Born in Ethiopia, she left that country at age 12 as part of Operation Solomon, when Israel airlifted some 14,500 Ethiopian Jews in less than two days as civil war and famine raged in the Horn of Africa. The new arrivals struggled to transition from their developing home country to Israel, with many Ethiopian Israelis alleging racist treatment, police harassment and discriminatory slights. As an adult, she served in a gunsmith unit in Israel’s military. She moved to the U.S. after marrying a Ukrainian-American doctor in 2005. Pilip was elected to the Nassau County legislature in 2021. Though she publicly identifies as a Republican, Pilip registered as a Democrat when she got to the U.S. and still hasn’t changed her voter registration. She said she drifted away from the party as it became more liberal. A spokesman said Pilip decided to wait until after the election to formally change her party affiliation to avoid legal complications that could potentially knock her off the ballot. Despite her background, Pilip has hammered Democrats and President Joe Biden over U.S. immigration policy. She has argued for additional policing of the border to stop illegal immigration as well as the construction of a border wall. She held one of her first news conferences of the campaign outside a site in Queens, where New York City officials had set up a large shelter to house homeless migrants, many of whom were bused to New York after crossing the southern border. “This is a big concern for my district,” Pilip said. “A lot of residents very much worry about this. No one asked them if they want to have male migrants living next to their playground. They don’t like that.” Suozzi, a political moderate, has meanwhile distanced himself from policies that have damaged Democrats in the New York suburbs. “The Democratic brand has been decimated over the past three years,” Suozzi said. “It started with crime in New York City and the bail reform that took place and that was very effectively weaponized by the Republicans.” “That crime issue now has been exacerbated by the migrant issue,” he said. As the election nears, Suozzi has increasingly talked about strengthening border policy, pointing out times when he bucked his own party on the issue when he was in Congress. He said recently that he would support a temporary closure of the U.S.-Mexico border to slow the flow of migrants into the country. Biden has used similar rhetoric on the border. The former congressman has also stressed his deep experience in governing — three terms in Congress as well as stints as a mayor and a county executive on Long Island — as evidence he could strike bipartisan agreements on difficult issues, such as ongoing congressional negotiations over border control and the Israel-Hamas war. “This is serious business. This requires some ability and some competence to navigate the politics and the governing and the policy and the domestic and the international,” he said. “She’s unvetted, she’s unprepared and will make things worse.” Pilip, for her part, has aggressively moved to counter criticism from Suozzi and Democrats that she is anti-abortion, a centerpiece of the Democratic Party’s overall election year strategy. Pilip said that while she is personally opposed to abortion, she would oppose any attempt by Congress to ban it nationwide. She has also said mifepristone, an abortion medication, should be available nationally. “Abortion is a personal decision, a personal choice. Every woman should make that decision. Therefore I’m not going to support a national abortion ban and I’m not going to risk a woman’s health care,” Pilip said. Abortion rights have been a winning issue for Democrats in recent elections. Polling has shown a broad swath of Americans support at least some access to the procedure. The race is hard to handicap. Suozzi has some of the advantages that usually come with incumbency. He had a comfortable victory in his last race in the district in 2020, defeating Santos, then a relatively unknown Republican. The same year, Biden beat Donald Trump in the district. But two years later, Santos, falsely portraying himself as a wealthy, Wall Street financial wizard, beat Democrat Robert Zimmerman in the midterm elections. That was part of a wave of Republican victories in Long Island elections in recent years in both congressional and local races. But his spectacular crash-and-burn tenure in Congress could linger in the minds of voters weighing a choice between the parties. Another question that has loomed over the race has been whether the district will exist in its current form for much longer. The state’s highest court threw out New York’s congressional map late last year and ordered a new set of lines to be drawn by the end of February. The ruling was a major win for Democrats in the state who have angled for more favorable congressional districts. It remains unclear exactly what approach Democrats will take on redistricting but the party could try to reshape the district in their favor, no matter who wins, perhaps by including a slightly larger slice of New York City.

Joe Biden returned to an area of the country decimated by industrial outsourcing and emblematic of the fight before him. Biden on Thursday visited the Wisconsin border city of Superior in the northwestern corner of the state, across Lake Superior\'s St. Louis Bay from Duluth, Minn. — two blue communities, known as the Twin Ports, that used to rely on heavy industry and mining. Now they are surrounded by an area that has grown more favorable to Trump as those jobs have evaporated. ""This was the rock-solid Democratic core,"" said Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance in the Hubert H. Humphrey School and the Department of Political Science at the University of Minnesota. ""Over the last 20 years or so, that stronghold is gone."" Biden spoke to supporters gathered at Earth Rider Brewery in Superior and seized on economic trends showing growth outpacing the fall of inflation, touting his administration\'s work to boost job creation by focusing on infrastructure projects — including a new $1 billion plan to replace a key bridge connecting the Twin Ports. ""Things are finally starting to sink in,"" Biden said to the crowd of his economic message reaching voters. ""This bridge is important, but the story we\'re writing is much bigger than that. When you see shovels in the ground and cranes in the sky, and people hard at work on these projects, I hope you feel a renewed sense of pride."" Biden is seeking to boost voters\' views of his handling of economic issues in part by focusing on projects that will create jobs in sectors squeezed by outsourcing. He used the visit to announce new funding to replace the 60-year-old Blatnik Bridge on Interstate 535 that connects Superior to Duluth. Funding for the bridge, which spans St. Louis Bay, will come from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and is part of a $4.9 billion investment toward 37 transportation infrastructure projects across the country. ""For decades people talked about replacing this bridge, but it never got done — until today,"" Biden said in his eighth trip to Wisconsin as president. ""We started investing in America again,"" Biden said. ""Our infrastructure used to be the best in the world ... but over a period of time we stopped investing in America. We stopped investing in ourselves."" The funding for the projects, which Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg this week called ""the next generation of the cathedrals of American infrastructure"" that will help shape the economy, also includes $8 million to expand a safety rest stop for trucks on I-90 in Sparta. The investment for the Blatnik Bridge is the largest of the projects Biden highlighted Thursday. The bridge carries 33,000 vehicles per day and billions of dollars in freight each year, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Biden said Thursday the project is expected to create 10,000 new jobs. The jobs message is critical in this region, Jacobs said. ""Jobs are a huge challenge in this part of Minnesota and Wisconsin,"" Jacobs said. ""Trump has used that to his advantage. The protectionism platform that Trump had and has played beautifully to this area. It\'s just the kind of thing that he can use to appeal to independents and folks who might have been Democrat at one point."" ""In other parts of the country, there\'s a lot of criticism of Trump over the 2020 election denialism, immigration, and other things, but in this part of the country, it\'s really suffered dramatic economic decline,"" he added. Biden\'s stop is one of three in Wisconsin from the president or a top administration official just this week — signaling a hard focus on the battleground state he won four years ago as the 2024 election kicks into gear. Vice President Kamala Harris in a visit to Waukesha County Monday made clear abortion rights would remain central in the race for the White House, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is scheduled to arrive in Milwaukee Friday to highlight Biden\'s job-creation efforts. The president has put recent economic growth and investments in infrastructure at the forefront of his bid to retain the White House, though many Americans, including those in Wisconsin, remain skeptical and have not credited him with the improvements. A Marquette University Law Poll of Wisconsin voters from November found that just 27% of respondents described the economy as “excellent” or “good” while 36% described it as “not so good” and 37% labeled it “poor.” Still, the economy has improved in the last several months, with the inflation rate receding as the impacts of the COVID pandemic slowly fade. The national unemployment rate has hovered around 3.7%, and in Wisconsin, the unemployment rate dropped from 4.6% at the start of 2021 to 3.3% at the beginning of this year, according to the White House. Biden and his team, meanwhile, have consistently tried to send that message of improvement and investment directly to voters, largely through stops like Thursday\'s in Superior. ""We believe that the president is the best messenger,"" Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""If he can go into a state, a rural area, go into Superior, Wisconsin, talk about a project that we invested in because of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, something that the president fought for… I think that’s important."" Wisconsin Republicans ahead of Biden\'s visit, however, sought to dispel those notions and attempted to paint the former president as desperate to win over voters in the swing state. ""Look, there\'s a reason we\'re getting all this tourism in Wisconsin from the White House,"" Republican Party of Wisconsin chairman Brian Schimming told reporters Thursday. ""And that is not that we all know that President Biden will lose Wisconsin in November. It\'s because he\'s lost Wisconsin already."" Schimming cited higher grocery prices Wisconsinites have seen over the past several years. And both Schimming and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin pointed to the U.S.-Mexico border as a major issue Biden needs to deal with. Johnson Thursday morning dismissed a GDP report that showed the economy grew 3.1% over the last year, saying ""the damage has already been done and people are feeling it."" ""I hope people have their eyes open and realize what a disaster his governance has been for their lives, their family, their well-being and for this nation,"" Johnson told the Journal Sentinel. Rep. Tom Tiffany, whose northwestern Wisconsin district includes Superior, said it was ""great"" that the Blatnik Bridge was going to be improved but said it shouldn\'t cost $1 billion in federal funds to do so, attacking Biden for being ""hostile to mining"" and over how the government approves new infrastructure projects. Tiffany voted against the infrastructure bill. Biden likely picked the area to also motivate Democrats in Duluth, Minnesota\'s fifth-most populous city where Biden\'s support remains strong, Jacobs, the University of Minnesota professor, said. ""If Joe Biden is gonna win Minnesota again ... they\'re going to need Duluth\'s support and they\'re going to need good turnout in Duluth"" in order to trim support for Trump in the area, he said. Jacobs said coupled with double-digit support Biden received in Wisconsin\'s Douglas, Bayfield and Ashland counties in 2020, the visit is ""a strategic, efficient trip."" Biden carried Wisconsin in 2020 by about 21,000 votes and carried Minnesota by more than 230,000. Since then, his approval rating in both states has hovered in the 40s. Debby Strop, co-owner of Uncle Loui\'s Cafe in Duluth, told the Journal Sentinel on Thursday she does not identify with either major party but appreciates Biden\'s visit. ""I\'m glad he\'s here. It shows he really cares. If he didn\'t why would he be here?"" she said, noting the cold and foggy weather. Despite this, Strop said she doesn\'t want either Trump or Biden to run. Their age is a major issue for her. Afton Iliff, a 21-year-old Duluth resident who works as a heavy-equipment operator and will work on the bridge replacement project, told the Journal Sentinel she was not aware of who was running for president this year but didn\'t support either candidate when informed. ""I don\'t like either of them. Biden is way too old and Trump is a horrible person,"" Iliff said. ""The people in office are too old. They\'re not even going to see the changes they are voting for. They\'re older than sliced bread."" Iliff said she doesn\'t identify with either political party and is unsure if she\'ll vote in 2024. Small Democratic cities like Superior were an ingredient in Trump’s victory in Wisconsin — cities like Janesville, Platteville, Portage, Prairie du Chien, Ashland, Kenosha, Washburn, Beloit, Black River Falls and Baraboo. Trump lost these cities but by less than Republicans did in 2012, which made them a key to his narrow 2016 victory of about 23,000 votes over Hillary Clinton.

Duncan said numerous shots were fired by the offender throughout the event, but no shots were fired by officers. At 1:30 a.m., the sheriff\'s office posted again on social media that the incident had been resolved. ""It was crazy,"" Sours said. ""It was touch-and-go there at first, but once the police got there, I felt safer and knew they were handling the situation well."" Dean Hensley is the news editor for the Hendersonville Times-News.

Chance of rain 40%. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 2:52 am New recycling compost bins On Jan. 19, 2024, the Office of Sustainability launched its new recycling pilot program to lessen the amount of paper wasted at UNC Charlotte. The program\'s goal is to decrease paper waste by 60%. To accomplish that goal, new paper towel bins were installed in bathrooms in Fretwell. New trash cans, now named paper towel bins, were implemented on each floor of Fretwell. One slot is for paper towels, and another for general waste, which directs the used paper towels for easier sorting and recycling usage. Fretwell was explicitly chosen to start the program because of how the building was set up. ""We chose Fretwell because it\'s academic as well as administrative,"" said Nicholas Weber, the recycling program associate. ""There\'s the office buildings and the classrooms, so you\'re getting a mix of everyone that comes to campus."" By reducing the amount of paper wasted at Charlotte, the University can lower the amount of money wasted each year, resulting in other programs or additions. More advanced trash cans will be added to other buildings on campus. ""Part of it was trying to start with Fretwell as a manageable place,"" said Shannon Caveny-Cox, the solid waste coordinator for the Office of Sustainability. ""There are 14 restrooms that we\'re doing collections out of. It was small enough that we felt that we would be able to take care of all the waste without it becoming a mess."" This new pilot program is a multi-step process that involves a simple yet effective plan. First, workers are assigned throughout the week to pick up the paper towels in the various paper towel bins throughout Fretwell using a 64-gallon roll cart. Any assorted trash that isn\'t paper towels is put into a separate bag. Then, the roll carts are brought to the Fretwells loading dock. A contractor called Earth Farms is on campus during the week to pick up any compostable materials from the dining facilities and the paper towel roll carts. Earth Farms picks up the compostable materials and delivers them to its facility. The materials can be mixed and stored on a large area of land, ultimately becoming compost. This newly created compost is intended to be used for various plant-based tasks. ""As the organic materials decompose, they become a nutrient-rich mixture that can be used as soil,"" said Cox. If the recycling compost program is successful, Charlotte can potentially maintain a cost-effective and environmentally conscious campus in the future.

As technology continues to evolve, so does its role in helping us lead healthier lives. One groundbreaking development in this realm is the use of tech for stress monitoring. These innovative devices have opened up new avenues for promoting wellness by providing real-time insights into our stress levels and aiding us in managing them effectively. Let us delve into the transformative power of wearable tech for stress monitoring and its significant impact on our overall well-being. The journey of wearable tech for stress monitoring began with basic heart rate monitors and pedometers. However, technological advancements have propelled these devices into a new realm of sophistication. Today, wearable tech can seamlessly track an array of physiological and psychological parameters, surpassing the limitations of early iterations. These encompass heart rate variability, skin conductance, sleep patterns, and even emotional states. This multifaceted data collection provides a holistic picture of stress levels and sheds light on triggers, offering a deeper insight into the intricate interplay between mental and physical well-being. This level of understanding proves especially invaluable for individuals grappling with mental health issues or undergoing rehabilitation, enabling them to address stressors with heightened precision and personalized strategies. One of the standout features of tech for stress monitoring is its ability to provide real-time insights. Traditional methods of stress assessment often involve periodic visits to healthcare professionals or self-reporting, both of which may lack accuracy and immediacy. On the other hand, wearable stress monitors offer continuous data collection and analysis, seamlessly integrating into the user's daily routine. This ongoing stream of information empowers users to not only identify stress patterns but also gain a deeper understanding of how various factors impact their stress levels. Armed with this knowledge, individuals can proactively make informed lifestyle adjustments on the go, enhancing their ability to manage stress and promote a sense of overall well-being. The data collected by wearable stress monitoring devices isn't just raw information – it's a valuable resource that can be harnessed for better stress management. Most wearable tech comes with user-friendly apps or platforms that transform complex data into easy-to-understand visualizations. These visual representations allow individuals to track their stress levels over time, pinpoint triggers, and assess the effectiveness of their relaxation techniques. This empowerment fosters a proactive approach to stress management and encourages users to take control of their well-being. What sets wearable tech for stress monitoring apart is its potential for personalization. These devices can adapt to an individual's unique stress profile and provide tailored interventions. For instance, if a person's stress levels are consistently high during a particular time of day, the device may suggest relaxation exercises or mindfulness techniques to practice during that period. This personalized feedback not only enhances stress management but also promotes a sense of support and guidance. Wearable tech proves to be a valuable ally for individuals in addiction recovery who encounter triggers. These devices offer real-time insights into triggers' onset by continuously monitoring physiological responses and emotional states. This proactive awareness equips users with the tools to recognize potential challenges and deal with them effectively. Whether it's through guided breathing exercises, mindfulness techniques, or personalized interventions, wearable tech empowers individuals to navigate triggers and make healthier choices on their journey toward sustained recovery Wearable tech for stress monitoring has the ability to break down barriers to stress management and wellness promotion. It eliminates the need for specialized equipment or clinical visits, making stress monitoring accessible to a broader population. Additionally, the continuous nature of data collection raises awareness about stress patterns that may have otherwise gone unnoticed. This newfound awareness encourages individuals to take proactive steps towards better stress management and improved well-being. As technology continues to advance, the future of wellness promotion is undoubtedly intertwined with tech for stress monitoring.

Academy (GLA) was the primary topic of discussion at a two-hour long special meeting of the Board of Education on Monday night. The board heard a presentation from GLA Principal Heath Foster and GLA teacher Lane Beshears as well as numerous comments from parents and students pleading for continuation of the program. The board did not make a decision on the e-learning academy Monday but did vote to end the Appalachian State University lab school program at Elkin City Schools which began last school year in 2022. The board voted unanimously to end the program on June 30 of this year. Known as The Academy at Elkin, the second of its kind operated by ASU, was hailed with great pride when it first opened at the start of the 2022-23 school year. According to its website, “The Academy at Elkin is a learner-centered community that promotes exploration-based learning. Students are encouraged to think deeply and critically about learning that is meaningful and relevant to their culture, lives, and future.” Javascript is required for you to be able to read premium content.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 2:48 am Although you’d never know it by looking at the campus now, at one time, the land where Guilford Technical Community College now sits was home to a sanatorium that treated tuberculosis, the leading cause of death at the turn of the 20th century. Also called consumption, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the best treatment for the lung disease was thought to be rest and fresh air, often in a rural setting. Patients were often away from their families for years. The first cottage sanatorium in the United States opened in 1920. Reports show that 125 people in Guilford County died of tuberculosis in 1920. With the rural setting in mind, several Greensboro citizens, including Cesar Cone who himself was diagnosed with TB, created the Guilford County Tuberculosis Sanatorium on High Point Road, now East Main Street, on property once owned by the Iddings family. On Dec. 20, 1921, county voters passed a $100,000 bond issue to build and finance a facility to treat tuberculosis patients — away from uninfected local residents. Private donations and the sale of Christmas seals raised another $125,000. According to a report by Mrs. Annette Sloan Tinsley, dated Oct. 31, 1923, “the medical society passed a resolution whereby every case of tuberculosis coming under their observation shall be reported to the county hospital. This makes the hospital a clearing house for all tuberculosis work.” The new brick sanatorium opened Jan. 22, 1924. Reports at the time called it “one of the most modern and best equipped institutions of its kind in the South.” Cost with furnishings was $165,000. “The Guilford County Tuberculosis Sanatorium is the first institution built under the act of 1917, which authorized any county to build and maintain a tuberculosis hospital by bond issue and special tax,” said Dr. J.L. Spruill, the sanatorium’s first superintendent. Main Building at Guilford County Tuberculosis Sanatorium. “The object of this institution is to have a place where the tuberculosis patients of Guilford County can go to be cured, and not a place where people go to die,” said Dr. Spruill. The first floor of the main building housed a waiting room, business office, X-ray rooms, exam rooms, dining room, kitchen and staff dining room. The second floor contained physician’ and nurses’ quarters. There were 60 beds, all situated off porches, and separated for men and women. There also was a wing that provided care for African Americans. A separate children’s ward opened in 1926 with its own dining room and kitchen. At most, the campus treated 140 patients. According to an area newspaper at the time, the “wards were light and pleasant with views of Guilford County. Each ward is screened, faces, the south and affords plenty of sunlight, something needed in the treatment of the disease. The beds will be kept on the porch at all times except when there is a blizzard, or exceedingly stormy weather, making it necessary to move them inside.” Patients were charged $1 per day which included everything but personal laundry. No patient was turned away for inability to pay, however. To say the sanatorium was much-needed in the county would be an understatement. It is believed the sanatorium treated 987 patients in 1937 alone. Many patients were ambulatory and often did crafts, walked on a track, read, exercised and sat in the sun. They received nutritious meals, regular medications and occupational therapy. Some of the embroidery and leatherwork crafts done by patients were sterilized and sold at craft fairs. Dr. M.D. Bonner, who had come to work with Dr. Spruill, succeeded him in 1934. Bonner served until the hospital closed. With the development of drugs to treat the disease, the number of cases in Guilford County dropped and the sanatorium closed in late 1955. Remaining patients were moved to a state sanatorium in Moore County. The Guilford Industrial Educational Center — later Guilford Technical Institute and now GTCC — opened at the location in 1958 as a vocational training center to supplement the public school system. The sanatorium buildings were used for over 18 years before being replaced with modern classroom buildings. This postcard shows the grounds of the sanatorium. East Main Street is on the right and the railroad tracks on the left. Neither are shown. When driving along East Main Street in front of the GTCC campus, notice the ornate gazebo. It is the only original remaining part of the sanatorium and was originally a bus stop. See Dec. 13, 2023, Jamestown News for Shelly Lutzweiler’s address to the Historic Jamestown Society regarding the Iddings family. Three 1958-59 seventh-grade classes at Jamestown Public School have a dubious distinction. They attended school in a sanatorium. A former sanatorium, that is. The Guilford County Tuberculosis Sanatorium, which was located where GTCC is now, closed in 1955, leaving the buildings vacant. As a result of overcrowding in the public school, the three classes of youngsters boarded buses at neighboring Jamestown Elementary for their school day in the main building on the sanatorium campus. They had to wait for the two buses to finish their regular routes, thereby ensuring the students a slightly shorter school day. The classes became closer because they spent a lot of time on the buses. Since there was no cafeteria at the sanatorium, they had to return to the public school for lunch, then travel back to the sanatorium for afternoon classes, with a final trip back at day’s end. Some of the seventh-graders stayed at the public school. Band students practiced during the day and it would have required yet another bus ride. Also, some classes were combination sixth/seventh and didn’t move. Apparently few parents or students objected to attending school in a building that once treated an infectious disease. As a precaution, the building was fumigated before the start of the school year and several times during the stay of the students. Log In Keep it Clean.

Governor Roy Cooper signed an executive order to expand opportunities to citizens previously in prison. Gov. Roy Cooper announced a new initiative Monday to help more formerly incarcerated people successfully transition to stable lives outside of prison. As part of that effort, Cooper signed an executive order directing agencies under his control to coordinate on improving what is known as prison reentry. Each agency has been given specific directives that include identifying more “second chance” employers, increasing access to career services, increasing work release, apprenticeship and employment opportunities, and improving the parole process. “Our communities are much safer, and much stronger, when we come together to help everybody succeed,” Cooper said at a news conference at the Executive Mansion. “We want to make sure that people have real opportunities when they leave prison, that they won’t go back to doing the same things that got them there,” he said. “Strengthening our efforts to support people who are reentering their communities after being incarcerated helps us to do just that.” Under the executive order, North Carolina is also joining Reentry 2030, a national initiative to improve reentry after prison that Alabama and Missouri have also signed onto. Agencies involved include the Department of Adult Correction, the Office of State Human Resources and the Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission. Adult Correction Secretary Todd Ishee announced a number of goals the state intends to achieve by 2030, aligning with the national program, including: ▪ Increasing the number of high school and post-secondary credentials earned by incarcerated people by 75%, ▪ Increasing the number of post-secondary degrees that are available in prisons by 25%, ▪ Increasing the number of Pell Grant partners by 30%, ▪ Reducing the number of incarcerated people being released homeless by 50%, ▪ Allowing every person who is eligible to apply for Medicaid before release, ▪ Increasing the number of apprenticeships completed by incarcerated people by 50%, ▪ And increasing the number of employers that partner to hire incarcerated people by 30%. Ishee said that in addition to the ambitious goals the state is setting for itself, prison and reentry officials are also “presented with a significant opportunity to change how we define success.” Instead of just thinking about recidivism, Ishee said, the prison system needs to do more to measure and talk about positive outcomes like “successful transition back into our communities, steady employment, family reunification” and “attaining higher levels of education and training.” The executive order also calls for increasing the number of local reentry councils in the state, which help people find employment, housing and other services they might need, after returning from prison. Greg Singleton, the dean of workforce and continuing education programs at Central Carolina Community College, said reentry programs had helped him adjust to life outside prison, and inspired him to establish the Craven Pamlico Re-Entry Council in 2016. Singleton, who served four years in federal prison in the 1990s, said one of the reasons reentry councils are effective is because they include formerly incarcerated people, who can connect with people just exiting the prison system in a way others can’t. “I am able to speak from a tone that they cannot,” Singleton said. “I can look an inmate in the eye and say I understand, and that’s what they need.” ______ ©2024 The Charlotte Observer.

Yost | Feb 9, 2024 | News Guilford County Commissioner Pat Tillman had an interesting question at a recent work session of the Guilford County Board of Commissioners where the board was discussing several important Sheriff’s Department issues, such as officer pay and the $27 million construction contract to build a new administrative headquarters for the department. During the discussion, Tillman asked, “Where’s the Sheriff?,” and added that, since he’s been a commissioner, Guilford County Sheriff Danny Rogers hasn’t been there to answer questions, address the board or provide perspective that only the sheriff can provide. Tillman later elaborated on his remarks. “I’ve been on the board for 14 months and we’ve talked about [for the Sheriff’s Department] an airplane, tasers, the new headquarters and many other issues,” and Tillman added that Rogers doesn’t address the board on those issues or even show up for the discussion most of the time. For instance, Rogers wasn’t at the Thursday, Feb. 1 work session when the Board of Commissioners decided to approve a giant contract for the Sheriff’s Department’s new headquarters. Tillman acknowledged that the department does send very well-informed staff to make presentations and answer questions from the board, however, he said he would often like to hear from the man who’s running the show. He said critical issues like officer pay, recruitment and retention, and major projects get discussed without Rogers in the room. “I think it’s important that the high sheriff, elected by the people, be there when we talk about these priorities like personnel retention, filling vacancies and other matters. I know it’s important to him, and I think it would be nice to hear from him on these issues sometimes.” Tillman also said that, in the corporate world, a CEO would almost never be a no-show at a meeting when key matters facing the company were under discussion. Chairman of the Guilford County Board of Commissioners Skip Alston said, after being told of Tillman’s remarks, that the sheriff has more important matters to attend to when presentations to the Board of Commissioners can be addressed by knowledgeable officers with a direct connection to a project or issue. “The sheriff is very busy,” Alston said. “He’s out there protecting the people and out on patrol. He’s got a lot better things to do than sit in a meeting for a couple of hours.” About Scott D.

The term “high sheriff” is an old term from England where the sheriff was the top official in a county and represented the king or queen. Yeah, we know that, Al. Marklsparkl is referencing something else entirely… ——— [ The Reeve was the law enforcement official of the local Lord, charged with enforcing “the law”, which was mostly whatever the Lord said it was. The senior Reeve might cover the whole county, in which case he was called the Shire Reeve, which has mutated over the centuries into…. Sheriff. ] I love someone important ask wheres Danny they too get the run around…shady things going with Danny. 100 people short is unheard of I say before they tackle a new office let’s stock the department with staff first. If not Danny can down size and pull his personnel staff to work in the jail… No new office until the is staffed I say…. I just have to go one more… only thing I’ve seen him do is go to retirement event and vacation hot spots… Skip knows Danny is dirty knowing that if Danny falls Skip will too. According to Skip Alston the Sheriff is so busy out there on Patrol protecting people? Appears to me that he is also missing in action as the Crime Rate, Aggravated Assault Rate, Murder Rate, and Vehicular Crash Rate is at an all time high in Guilford County! Appears to me Guilford County Sheriff Danny Rogers needs to spend less time in clothing stores and spend more time representing the Guilford County Sheriff’s Dept. and enforcing all city, state, and federal laws to protect the safety of the County’s Law Abiding Citizens! Jim Donaldson Whoa Pat….you just about got the race card played! Over 100 staff short and Danny wants a new office….no thank you. He can down size his office move all those folks into the Detention Center which would house everything. —— I just don’t believe that Rogers never attends Commissioner meetings because he’s “out on patrol”. BS. And I wouldn’t be at all surprised if he is indeed “the high Sheriff…” And also about this new office that Danny Rogers wants. If you think if he’s 100 officer short that’s 100 people that money has been put aside for payroll and uniforms. Where is all that money for officers and uniforms? That’s 100 people that’s a lot of money. Danny can downsize he doesn’t need that much office personnel when Sheriff Barnes did much more with a lot less Leave it to Skip to cover for the Sheriff. I agree with Tillman, he needs a presence to the board. Anyone think ol’ Skip would have been as accommodating if BJ Barnes was still the Sheriff?? So Sheriff Brown can’t attend the commissioner’s meeting to discuss major spending requests, because he is out “patrolling” (according to Skip) but his lieutenants are at the meeting instead of patrolling. Anybody else snickering a little bit right now? The sheriff is Near I call bullsh$$ on alston’s answer about the cowboy clown not showing up at commissioners meeting. Patrolling and protecting the citizens, yeah right. What a crock Danny’s busy alright but I’d bet it’s not the kind of busy he should be doing. As far as Alston taking up for the Sheriff just another example of one black hand washing the other. Our sherrif is a racist joke He’s defiantly not out on patrol or protecting the people. Really a 2x fired domestic abuser such as Rodgers should not have access to a weapon at all He can’t legally carry or posses a firearm “…better things to do.,..? Like sending deputies to change locks on residents’ apartments despite the fact their appeal has not been heard. There’s no way that new office should begin at this time.

Read more May 20, 2024 My biggest complaint about writer/director/star John Krasinski’s new movie “IF”… is that it’s a movie. What I mean is that Krasinski clearly has some broad ideas for worldbuilding and there are many interesting characters in the mix, but the movie has to rush so much to stay within the “movie” format of a two-hour runtime that the whole thing is kind of a mess.

The project has signed four new office leases and continues to add spec suites across the portfolio. Additionally, local favorite Seemingly Overzealous Ice Cream will open a pop-up shop in front of Not Just Coffee in May and Maíz Agua Sal (MAS), a modern Mexican scratch kitchen, tortilleria and agave bar, has officially begun service. Barry Fabyan, Co-Managing Director at Stream Realty, which handles office leasing for Lower Tuck, said, “Charlotte’s West Side is hopping; the heavy lifting of establishing this area as a competitive office and retail market has been done, and we are now seeing the fruits of those efforts with the leasing momentum at Lower Tuck.” The office spec suite program has proven effective for Lower Tuck with companies attracted to the modern, turnkey workspaces delivered inside the adaptive reuse settings. The project is pushing forward on six new spec suites spanning 33,000 square feet. The additions will be complete in June and bring Lower Tuck’s spec suites program up to 20 total. Two of the new spec suites have already been leased, which joins two additional spec suite leases signed in the first quarter. The new tenants are as follows: Evans General Contractors taking a 6,500-square-foot space at 800 Gesco Street Design Collaborative, an architecture, engineering and interior design firm, is expanding within the project into a 4,700-square-foot suite at 800 Gesco Street Stimmel Associates, a landscape architecture, engineering, land planning and design firm, has leased 3,900 square feet at 1018 Jay Street Liberty Atlantic Development Group is a full-service commercial real estate company with a focus on rental housing and economic development in North Carolina and will occupy a 2,000-square-foot spec suite at 1018 Jay Street This month, global manufacturing company Positec took occupancy of another 9,000-square-foot spec suite as part of its expansion at 929 Jay Street from 27,000 to 35,500 square feet. “When we entered the Charlotte market in 2022, the move-in ready suite was a perfect option,” noted Kevin Scully, Partner and Senior Architect at Design Collaborative. “Lower Tuck has been great for culture and attracting talent. We have exceeded our growth projections and are delighted that we could relocate to a new larger suite so quickly within the project.” This spring, Seemingly Overzealous will join Lower Tuck in a repurposed camper located in front of Not Just Coffee. The beloved local ice cream brand is owned and operated by partners Garrett Tichy and Jess Berresse, and opened its first location at Camp North End in May 2023. All of its flavors are dairy-free and handmade, with the entire menu designed to accommodate those with food allergies. The ice cream camper will be open on weekends and special occasions by May 1. Maíz Agua Sal (MAS), a modern Mexican scratch kitchen, tortilleria and agave bar from ARDR Hospitality Group (Lincoln Street Kitchen & Cocktails, The Green Room and Craft Tasting Room & Growler Shop) is now open at 1018 Jay Street. About Lower Tuck: Lower Tuck is a district of mid-century warehouses remixed into a creative office and retail campus. The nearly 400,000-square-foot adaptive reuse community spans eight buildings on Jay Street, Gesco Street and Tuckaseegee Road. The project is being developed in three phases; the first phase, which encompasses 929, 1026 and 1018 Jay Street, has been completed and stabilized. The second phase – 800 and 845 Gesco – is under construction now. Third & Urban is the project developer. To learn more visit lowertuck.com.

Construction employment rose in 234, or 65 percent, of 358 metro areas between March 2023 and March 2024, according to an analysis by the Associated General Contractors of America of new government employment data. Association officials noted that demand for a range of projects, from infrastructure to manufacturing and data centers, continues to grow in many parts of the country even as firms struggle to find enough workers. “While high interest rates and post-Covid work patterns are reducing demand for certain types of projects, the overall construction market remains strong and many firms are still expanding their payrolls,” said Ken Simonson, the association’s chief economist. “But most firms are struggling to find enough workers as the number of qualified, available workers remains insufficient to satisfy the demand.” Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif. and Baton Rouge, La. added the most construction jobs (6,200 jobs each or 6 percent and 13 percent, respectively) between March 2023 and March 2024. Other metro areas with large numerical increases include Fort Worth-Arlington, Texas (5,700 jobs, 7 percent); Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Ariz. (5,200 jobs, 3 percent); and Detroit-Dearborn-Livonia, Mich. (5,000 jobs, 22 percent). The largest percentage gain—27 percent—occurred in Fairbanks, Alaska, which added 600 jobs. The pickup in Fairbanks was followed by Redding, Calif. (24 percent, 900 jobs); Detroit; Anchorage, Alaska (20 percent, 1,800 jobs); Danville, Ill. (20 percent, 100 jobs); and Lawton, Okla. (20 percent, 300 jobs). Construction employment declined over the year in 81 metro areas and was unchanged in 43 areas. The largest job loss occurred in New York City (-7,500 jobs, -5 percent), followed by Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minn.-Wis. (-5,700 jobs, -7 percent); Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, Colo.

(-11 percent, -1,300 jobs); and Bellingham, Wash. (-11 percent, -1,000 jobs). Association officials noted that some construction firms are choosing not to bid on projects because they lack sufficient staff to fulfill the work. They warned this will limit competition for vital new infrastructure and economic development projects. They urged Congress and the Biden administration to boost funding for construction education and training programs and to implement reforms to the immigration system. “Policy makers spent decades dismantling once-robust construction education programs, so even if Congress acts soon, it is going to take time to reinvigorate them,” said Jeffrey D. Shoaf, the association’s chief executive officer. “In the meantime, sensible immigration reform measures can allow more people to lawfully enter the country to work in construction and achieve the American dream.” BMO: 71% of Aspiring Homeowners Waiting for Rate Cuts Before Buying a Home; Nearly One-Third Tapping 401(k) Foreclosure activity nationwide shows slight decline U.S. Homeowner equity remains elevated but dips downward again in first quarter Rising insurance costs a growing concern for real estate investors Charlotte’s prestigious Blue Diamond Awards are back!

The investigation began in the summer of 2023, according to a release from the Rowan County Sheriff’s Office. The sheriff’s office, the N.C. State Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security Investigations initiated the investigation into the distribution of fentanyl in Rowan County and nearby locations. Anthony Angle, 53, was arrested as a result of the investigation on Dec. 20, 2023. Angle was arrested at the U.S. Probation Office, where he was for a meeting with his federal probation officer. Angle was charged with two counts of trafficking more than 100 grams of fentanyl. He was placed into the Rowan County Detention Center and given a $500,000 bond. A search warrant was then issued and executed on Angle’s residence, located in the 100 block of Apex Lane in Cleveland. The FBI and Salisbury Police Department assisted in the execution of the warrant and additional evidence was located, according to the release. Angle’s relative, 37-year-old Antonio Eugene Morris, was arrested on Jan. 19 after fleeing from a vehicle stop conducted by the sheriff’s office’s criminal apprehension team. Morris threw approximately 400 grams of a fentanyl and cocaine mixture out of the window during the chase, which was recovered by deputies, according to the release. Morris was charged with two counts of trafficking in fentanyl, maintaining a vehicle for storing a controlled substance, fleeing to elude arrest, attempting to destroy evidence and conspiracy to traffic fentanyl as a result of the incident. Morris was placed in the Rowan County Detention Center and given a $700,000 bond. Angle received an additional count of conspiracy to traffic fentanyl after his relative was arrested and had his bond increased to $525,000. The release states that the investigation is ongoing and is pending federal prosecution.'}]"

You may even make the evening news. If you want a 50-cent town, move to, I shiver just thinking about it, Clemmons. Orange barrels and shopping centers, oh my! I think we should feel fine holding on to a 10-cent town status. While somewhat boring to outsiders looking in at our lack of venues where we could waste our hard-earned money, us 10-centers still care about each other. Sure, we may talk smack about each other from time to time, but when the chips are down, we show up. Don’t expect that in a $50 town. For those of you who don’t know, Emmylou Harris is a music icon and a North Carolina native, so she knows plenty about 10-cent towns. The line is a verse in a song and the title of one of her albums. “Saturday night I’m gonna make myself a name Take a month of Sundays to try and explain.” That line is from the same song, and those of us who grew up in 10-cent or less valuable towns know, there’s some truth in there. Get a speeding ticket as a teenager, and your parents know before you get home. Honky Tonker Billy Joe Shaver knew the perils of being a bit too rowdy in a 10-cent town, as well: “I’m thinkin’ ‘bout raisin’ so doggone much hell, ‘Til I’ll die ‘fore I live it all down, yeehaw.” Here’s a verse from a Guy Clark song that helps sum up what it means to live in a 10-cent town. “Stuff that works, stuff that holds up The kind of stuff you don’t hang on the wall Stuff that’s real, stuff you feel The kind of stuff you reach for when you fall.” Yep, that’s us, all wrapped neatly into one well crafted country song. That’s what American music is, our lives wrapped into songs. That was evident while watching the Grammy Awards on television. Some, or maybe most, of the music aired on the TV show, I didn’t like. It was entertaining, and I appreciated the talent, but the music didn’t move me, and the lyrics, if I could understand them, didn’t touch me. Obviously, they weren’t from 10-cent towns. – Mike Barnhardt'}]"

Harvard President Claudine Gay addresses a hearing of the House Committee on Education on Dec. 5 in Washington.

the United States, many here at UNC Asheville are left wondering if they’ll get to see a winter wonderland before the flowers start to bloom. “Our students get very excited when rumors of snow start flying. Many have been known to chase the snow and drive to the N.C.-Tenn. border to have the best chance of observing dramatic snowfall rates,” Atmospheric Science professor George Miller said. Despite the student enthusiasm for braving harsh conditions when traction is questionable and visibility is poor, Miller said there are two factors making snowfall in Asheville more rare than one might hope. “El Niño activates the right kinds of storms. The type that moves across the Gulf of Mexico to our south and, potentially, brings lots of snow to Asheville. The other factor is to get cold air to Asheville at the same time the gulf low is moving through our region to the south. Getting both components happening at the right time makes these events relatively rare,” Miller said. According to professor Miller, the cold air source has been shrinking measurably over the last several winters. Asheville’s location in the French Broad River Valley also affects the nature of its weather patterns. “If the mountains take on moisture then the river valleys often make us too warm to observe snow. Weather observers in the mountains living at and above 3,000 feet in elevation often report accumulating snow when we here in Asheville just experience cold rain,” Miller said. Atmospheric science senior Alex Parker echoed Miller’s sentiment on how the mountains might impact snowfall in the area. “The mountains can sometimes act as a wall protecting us from heavy snowfall, but sometimes they enhance the snowfall. Which one you get depends on the environmental conditions,” Parker said. The events bringing Asheville the most snow are northwest flow snow events, according to Parker. “The windward side of the mountain range usually gets more snow accumulation than the leeward side. Lifting enhances precipitation on the northwest side of the mountains during these events. This means Asheville won’t get much snow unless the flow from the northwest is strong enough to ‘push’ snow over the mountains and into the valley,” Parker said. On Jan. 19 Asheville got a dusting of snow throughout the day, and according to senior Jason Leveille, several of his classmates got distracted during the snow event, and kept looking at radar and their observation tower to see what was happening on campus. “We all get very excited when there is even a possibility of snow, especially since snow accumulation days on campus have been few and far between for the past couple years. I love watching snow fall, even if it does not accumulate,” said the atmospheric science major. With only one more month of winter left, the window of opportunity for snowfall continues to shrink. Despite this, it’s best to brush up on winter-related protocols in the chance the temperature in Asheville dips, according to Leveille. “Always make sure you dress warmly, especially on days where temperatures go well below freezing. If you don’t have the ability to go places where higher accumulations occur, you can go outside when it snows and just enjoy the sight of it falling. That is something I like to do when it snows because of how pretty it can be,” Leveille said. For anyone who can’t get enough of the snow, greater chances of snowfall are almost guaranteed north of Asheville, along the N.C.-Tenn. border, according to Miller. “The closer you can get yourself to the spine of the Appalachians, the better the chances of having a lot of fun observing and playing in the snow. The best scenario is to get there in plenty of time and have a place to stay as a back-up plan in case more snow accumulates than expected,” Miller said.

Locke finished the game with four points and six rebounds in the Aggies’ CAA victory over Elon. Photo by Joe Daniels/Carolina Peacemaker.A year ago, the North Carolina A&T women’s basketball team started 6-1 in the Coastal Athletic Association. The Aggies went on to post an 8-1 record during the first half of the conference season before going 4-5 over the second half. After the ladies’ 56-42 win over the Elon Phoenix Sunday afternoon at Corbett Sports Center, A&T has won six straight to improve to 12-6 overall and 6-1 in conference play. Junior guard Jordyn Dorsey led the Aggies with 15 points, four rebounds and four assists on 5-for-10 shooting. The Aggies remain in a first-place tie with Stony Brook. Elon fell to 7-13 overall and 3-4 in league play. “They want to get back to where we were last year but finish the job,” said A&T head coach Tarrell Robinson. “(Assistant coach Asia Dozier) said sustainability. Is that a word? But our sustainability has to be on point this year, where it wasn’t last year. I continue to say that to them because I want to remind them this is where we were last year. Now let’s finish the job.” A&T was a perennial power in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC), winning four regular-season and three conference tournament titles in nine seasons under Robinson. The Aggies played their 25th game as a CAA program on Sunday, improving to 18-7 since joining the league. Despite the Aggies being under .500 in the second half last season, they finished only a game out of first place before losing in the first round of the CAA tournament due in part to injury and illness. “We fumbled the ball last year, so we had to step back and see what went wrong,” said Dorsey. “We understand we can’t get comfortable. We can’t forget they picked us eighth. Now, we are at the top, so we are motivated to work harder and get better individually and as a team.” The Aggies have won their previous six games by an average of 10.2 points while holding teams to 31.9 percent shooting from the field and 25.2 percent shooting from 3-point range. On Sunday, the Phoenix shot 28.3 percent from the field and were just 2-for-20 (.100) from three. Elon connected on six field goals in the first quarter and led 15-14 after the first. A&T’s defense got tenacious from there, allowing Elon a combined seven field goals made over the next two quarters combined, including only two in the second period. Despite the outstanding defense, the Aggies did not build a lead against the Phoenix until midway through the third quarter. Maraja Pass made a jump shot to give the Phoenix a 24-22 lead in the third. A&T responded by putting together an 11-0 run that included five points from Chaniya Clark and four points from Dorsey. A Bracone steal and a layup capped the run as the Aggies took a 33-24 lead with 3:01 to play in the third quarter. After an Elon free throw, Laila Acox continued the run as she slipped off a screen and found herself open underneath on the cut. Taila Davis lasered a pass to her for a layup. Ajia James fouled her and Acox completed the 3-point play for a 36-25 lead. A Jessica Booth spinning move for Elon in the lane chopped the lead to nine before Maleia Bracone waited in the corner for a Dorsey pass. Bracone caught the pass and splashed a three to put the Aggies ahead 39-27 with 36 seconds remaining. From the 6-minute mark of the third quarter until Bracone’s shot, the Aggies outscored the Phoenix 17-3. “We are always going to bring that,” Robinson said about the Aggies’ defense. “Offensively, we still have a lot of growth in that area. But there is never an excuse for not defending.” Elon did score the final five points of the third quarter and the first four of the fourth to cut A&T’s lead to 39-36 with 7:42 remaining in the game. But the Aggies gathered themselves again defensively, holding the Phoenix to one field goal over the next 4 1/2 minutes. Iycez Adams’s turnaround jumper cut A&T’s lead to 45-40. But freshman Paris Locke got a steal and scored, and senior D’Mya Tucker drove to the basket and scored. Two Bracone free throws competed A&T’s 6-0 run for a 51-40 lead with 1:55 to play. Elon never got any closer than nine the rest of the way. Clark had 12 points and seven rebounds on 8-for-12 shooting from the line. Bracone added 11 points, connecting on all six free throw attempts. Maya Johnson led the Phoenix with 11 points. A&T will play two of its next three on the road, starting with UNC Wilmington on Friday, Feb. 2 at 7 p.m. “Whatever is in front of us, we are ready,” said Robinson.

Despite the Aggies being under .500 in the second half last season, they finished only a game out of first place before losing in the first round of the CAA tournament due in part to injury and illness. “We fumbled the ball last year, so we had to step back and see what went wrong,” said Dorsey. “We understand we can’t get comfortable. We can’t forget they picked us eighth. Now, we are at the top, so we are motivated to work harder and get better individually and as a team.” The Aggies have won their previous six games by an average of 10.2 points while holding teams to 31.9 percent shooting from the field and 25.2 percent shooting from 3-point range. On Sunday, the Phoenix shot 28.3 percent from the field and were just 2-for-20 (.100) from three. Elon connected on six field goals in the first quarter and led 15-14 after the first. A&T’s defense got tenacious from there, allowing Elon a combined seven field goals made over the next two quarters combined, including only two in the second period. Despite the outstanding defense, the Aggies did not build a lead against the Phoenix until midway through the third quarter. Maraja Pass made a jump shot to give the Phoenix a 24-22 lead in the third. A&T responded by putting together an 11-0 run that included five points from Chaniya Clark and four points from Dorsey. A Bracone steal and a layup capped the run as the Aggies took a 33-24 lead with 3:01 to play in the third quarter. After an Elon free throw, Laila Acox continued the run as she slipped off a screen and found herself open underneath on the cut. Taila Davis lasered a pass to her for a layup. Ajia James fouled her and Acox completed the 3-point play for a 36-25 lead. A Jessica Booth spinning move for Elon in the lane chopped the lead to nine before Maleia Bracone waited in the corner for a Dorsey pass. Bracone caught the pass and splashed a three to put the Aggies ahead 39-27 with 36 seconds remaining. From the 6-minute mark of the third quarter until Bracone’s shot, the Aggies outscored the Phoenix 17-3. “We are always going to bring that,” Robinson'}]"

Yost | Feb 9, 2024 | News If you are walking or driving around Greensboro and see someone who looks like a giant ant, or like someone who just got off the slopes at Aspen but forgot his or her skis, don’t worry – everything’s OK. It’s just that, in Greensboro – as in other cities around the country – fellow residents are starting to wear Apple Vision Pro, the new mixed reality goggles from the iPhone maker. Apple has been selling the devices online and through the Apple Store at Friendly Shopping Center for nearly a week now and, already, area residents are starting to wear them out and about. The goggles let users see the world around them while also allowing them to do all sorts of things such as checking text messages, watching movies, working on virtual computer screens, browsing Safari or doing hundreds of other things. The fact that the goggles are controlled by hand gestures make the ant-like people look even stranger to onlookers because Vision Pro users are constantly waving their hands in the air, pinching their fingers together and pulling virtual objects closer to them. Before the devices launched early this month, many people scoffed at the idea that anyone would buy a relatively heavy headset that looks strange and has a starting cost of $3,500, but Apple sold out online within hours, and now the wait times for purchases has been pushed back to March, though the goggles are sometimes available in Apple Stores. Currently, the devices are only sold in the US, and in other countries people are paying thousands more than the retail price to get the headset. The Vision Pro has been described by reviewers as “amazing,” “next-level” and “magical.” The Apple Store at Friendly has had a steady stream of people coming in for free demonstrations, and one young boy who was leaving the store last weekend after experiencing the presentation had a huge smile on his face and told his father he was “blown away.” In other parts of the country, people have been spotted driving while wearing the headsets as well as using them on planes. Apple is selling them as fast as they can make them – so area residents should expect to see a lot more ant-people out and about waiving their hands in the future. Share: As you pointed out, IDIOTS are being see driving with these things on. This is not a good thing. This has to be the dumbest thing Ive read all week. Thank you for saving it ’til Friday. Let’s see how long it takes for some ignorant fecker to walk out in front of a bus wearing such ridiculous mess. Please bring back Y2k again.

DURHAM, N.C. — After Sunday’s 68-60 overtime loss to Duke, Deja Kelly said her team was pissed off. While head coach Courtney Banghart fielded questions during the post-game press conference, the senior guard and team captain kept her eyes fixed on the back wall, while first-year guard Reniya Kelly stared blankly at her hands in her lap. There was no hiding the palpable disappointment and frustration among North Carolina’s leading scorers. “The mentality has to be you’re pissed off,” Deja Kelly said. “We’re not good right now. We can be, but we’re not right now.” UNC\'s loss at Cameron Indoor Stadium marks the fourth straight loss for the Tar Heels. Offensive inconsistencies and foul trouble for key players took North Carolina out of rhythm and allowed Duke to execute a 15-4 run in extra time to hand UNC its second straight overtime defeat. “We weren’t good enough,” Banghart said. “Obviously, had a chance to win it there. And then, in overtime, they made more plays than us.” These issues aren’t new. After falling to Virginia in January, Kelly said the Tar Heels maintained some positivity. Then came the late-game breakdown in the N.C. State loss. Next, the Virginia Tech overtime heartbreaker in which graduate guard Lexi Donarski wished the team ""could have made a couple more shots at the end."" And now? Another overtime loss to deepen the team’s losing skid. Close, but once again, not good enough. “We got to get better late,” Banghart said. “Or else this is a feeling we’ll continue to feel.” Kelly has a long list of things the Tar Heels need to improve on. First, she pointed to the shooting troubles plaguing North Carolina. Specifically, she said UNC needs to finish around the rim, run more transition offense and find open shots. After putting up 20 points in the third quarter, UNC shot 2-of-14 in the fourth and 3-of-10 in extra time. Once again, this isn’t unfamiliar territory for the Tar Heels. Against then-No. 17 Virginia Tech, a lack of offensive cohesion stunted North Carolina’s efforts in its first ACC overtime battle, as they shot 13 percent from the field in crunch time. Currently, UNC ranks 11th in the conference in field goal percentage, shooting 42 percent from the field. “We’re taking too many contested shots late in the game,"" Banghart said. ""[We don\'t really have] a guy that can get shots for other people, to be honest, at a high enough rate."" Kelly said there also needs to be a focus on UNC\'s defense and rebounding efforts. Because Duke was stripping the ball right out of North Carolina’s hands and collecting so many offensive boards in the final minutes of regulation, she said it slowed down the little momentum her team gathered in the beginning of the first half. More than that, though, she said the Tar Heels need more players to adopt a “killer mentality” — to do whatever is necessary to get the win. One or two people cannot carry the effort on their own.

in Lake Toxaway. It is the second death of a resident there since 2014. Sheriff Chuck Owenby said in a Feb. 7 news release that an autopsy would be performed but the report from the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner might not be available for months. He said the autopsy was being conducted because the child\'s death ""appeared suspicious"" since he had arrived at the camp just 24 hours earlier. Owenby said the medical examiner did say the death was not natural, but that the cause and manner of the death was still pending. He said in the release that investigators applied for and were granted two search warrants for two locations at the camp. ""One location was at the base of the camp at 500 Winding Gap Road, where the incident occurred. The other was at 618 Sundance Lake Road in Pisgah Forest. The reason for the second location was that Trails Carolina camp had moved the other juvenile campers from the cabin where the incident occurred to that location,"" Owenby said in the release. Trails Carolina said in a Feb. 8 news statement that the staff members who were assigned to the cabin where the child died were reportedly placed on leave. ""We\'re not releasing any names at this time,"" Owenby said. Trails Carolina is licensed by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services as a residential therapeutic camp. ""We are shattered by the tragic loss of a young life and our deepest sympathies are with the student’s family and loved ones. Our priority is to acknowledge and respect the unfathomable impact on their lives and maintain the integrity of the investigation into the cause,"" the statement said. ""We are cooperating fully with investigators and have retained outside professionals to assist us in conducting our internal investigation."" A NCDHHS spokesperson said it was notified of the death on the camp earlier this week. ""While we cannot comment on ongoing or possible investigations, Trails Carolina notified NCDHHS Division of Health Service Regulation of a client death on Feb. 3. We extend our sympathy to the person’s family and friends,"" Summer Tonizzo, NCDHHS spokesperson, said in a Feb. 7 email to the Times-News.
