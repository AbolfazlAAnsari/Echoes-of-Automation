""It\'s bringing the world here rather than keeping our world small,"" Albany County Sheriff\'s Deputy Bill Yates told CBS correspondent Jim Axelrod. As word of mouth spread, Akal became a popular under-the-radar destination for truckers looking for something different along the Interstate. Five years later, Pandher\'s Indian cuisine is no longer under-the-radar. He recently opened a second truck stop on Interstate 80 in Nebraska and plans to expand in New Mexico next year. Pandher isn\'t the only business owner serving international cuisine along I-80 in Wyoming. 96 miles east, the Antelope Truck Stop Pronghorn outside of Burns also has an Indian restaurant which attracts customers from around the region.'}]"
