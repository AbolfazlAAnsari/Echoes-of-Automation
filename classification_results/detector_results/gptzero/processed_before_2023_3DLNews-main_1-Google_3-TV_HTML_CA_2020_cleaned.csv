And my habit of forcing my eyes wide open in pictures, making me look perpetually surprised, began to look more ridiculous than cool (happiness is always the best look, kids). When I stopped fighting back my Asian features, I learned to love them and embrace them as part of my identity. There’s power in revealing the simple fact that black hair and dark-colored eyes can also be beautiful. Karen Ho, 22, Animal Crossing enthusiast I was born and raised in San José, California, a large city in the Bay Area where Asian Americans outnumber Whites. However, when I went to a predominantly White college in middle-of-nowhere Upstate New York, there were so few Asian students that I kept getting mistaken as an “international student.” It was a total culture shock. I rolled with it, sidestepping microaggressions like “your English is so good!” with my friend from Hong Kong (whose first language is also English). And early on in the semester, I decided to sneak into an international student dinner with my new friend group composed of half international students and half domestic students. At the dinner, we all got name tags and had to write 1) our name and 2) “Where we were from.” I wrote “Angel” and “California,” but my domestic Asian American friends decided to write that they were from “Korea” and “China” even though they grew up in “L.A.” and “Connecticut.” That first semester of college marked the time when I deeply started contemplating what it meant to be Asian American.

Even though I primarily speak Teochew with my parents (and sprinkle in English phrases to fill in the language gaps), I would rate my level as no better than a fifth-grader. So, when my family and I traveled to our ancestral home of Jieyang, China to visit our relatives in March 2018, I knew I would have to speak only Teochew. I was nervous. I imagined my relatives chiding me for speaking the language so poorly, and that I was an ABC (American-born Chinese). Growing up in the heavily Asian-populated San Gabriel Valley, my parents’ friends would sometimes call me an “ABC;” they were being equally judgmental and playful, but it always made me feel embarrassed that I wasn’t Chinese enough. I expected my relatives in China to call me this, but they never did. Instead, they patiently listened as I spoke slowly, and encouraged me to'}]"

Ziegler says, a new exhibit is in the works. “And over on this side of the launch deck, you are going to eventually see our bear and coyote exhibit and that’s in design,” she said. “We hope to start constructing that this spring or summer. “ The entrance to the Redwood new Redwood Skywalk experience will be included with the standard paid entry into the Sequoia Park Zoo. “People are coming here for the Redwoods, they can kind of start here at the Sequoia Park Zoo, and get a real immersive experience,” said Ziegler. “I mean, nowhere else can you get this high, in a forest like this.” When the Redwood Skywalk is expected to open is still unknown, but they did tell Redwood News a special announcement is coming in early 2021.

She started her reporting career in 2015, working out of NBC5’s Upper Valley bureau, before moving up to the Plattsburgh bureau for several years. There, she covered the aftermath of the 2015 prison break at Clinton Correctional Facility in addition to hundreds of other stories impacting North Country viewers. Liz now reports out of NBC5’s main studio in South Burlington, where she has covered numerous stories that have impacted the lives of Vermonters. There have been many stories that have had an impact on Liz, but one that stands out is the 2019 quintuple murder trial of Steven Bourgoin. Liz spent an entire month in the courtroom, getting to know the families of Mary Harris, Janie Chase Cozzi, Eli Brookens, Cyrus Zschau and Liam Hale, the five teenagers killed at the hands of Bourgoin. She’s done several stories about the impact of their loss on the Mad River Valley community. A poem about kindness, written by Harris, hangs on Liz’s desk in the newsroom Liz is a native New Englander. She grew up in a small town in central Massachusetts and is no stranger to our region's cold winters and muggy summers (though, she prefers the latter). Liz loves traveling, singing, volunteering, exploring the picturesque small towns across our region, and likes to think of herself as a ‘coffee connoisseur’. Liz studied journalism at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Go Minutemen! She spent time in several newsrooms before coming to NBC5. She interned at WCVB-TV in Boston (NBC5’s sister station), WPRI-TV in Providence, RI, and WGGB-TV in Springfield, MA. Liz lives in Chittenden County with her fiancé and Labrador retriever, Marty. When she’s not reporting or drinking a cup of coffee, you can find Liz at the gym, learning a new song on the piano, exploring the outdoors with her dog, cheering on Boston sports teams, or attempting to cook. Liz loves all things local, and is excited to call this region home. If you have any story ideas, or just want to say hi, feel free to send Liz an e-mail: LStrzepa@hearst.com.
