The Daily Leader started as The Lake County Leader, a weekly newspaper, at the town of Herman in 1880. It moved to Madison in 1881 when the towns of Madison and Herman merged. The weekly Sentinel had been started at the town of Madison at a similar time. A decade later, the two newspapers converted to dailies and competed against one another for nearly a half-century before merging in 1938. Three generations of the Stahl family were publishers of the Daily Leader until the mid-1940s. George Hunter bought the newspaper in 1947 and was joined by sons Neil and Merrill. George Hunter continued as publisher until his death in 1966. Merrill Hunter took over as publisher and served until he died in 1990. Jon Hunter has been the publisher since.

Master Sgt. John Wirth (right), senior military science instructor for the ROTC program at South Dakota Mines, and cadets Monty Christo (from left), Sam Elliot and Annaliese Wollman prepare to present arms to begin the Veterans Day Parade on Thursday in downtown Rapid City. Cpl. Richard Parham, a World War II veteran, was the grand marshal for the 2021 Veterans Day Parade on Thursday in downtown Rapid City. Brayden Stephen, 10, a student at Zion Lutheran, listens to speakers with his classmates before the Veterans Day Parade on Thursday in downtown Rapid City. No veteran stood or sat alone during Rapid City’s Veterans Day celebrations on Thursday. Veterans joined each other in drinking coffee at Main Street Square, standing in the chilling wind during the Veterans Day Parade, or over lunch at VFW Post 1273. Civilians, too, joined in the celebrations, thanking those who served for their time in uniform. One particular veteran was honored at the head of the VFW’s luncheon table and was grand marshal for the parade — World War II Army veteran Cpl. Richard Parham. Parham served in the 96th Infantry Division, 381st Regiment during World War II and joined the service as an infantryman. He served in Leyte and Okinawa. ICYMI: Here's a replay of the Journal's live video coverage of the 2021 Rapid City Veterans Day Parade. Parham said people do respect veterans. He said when you’re in combat, it’s another thing altogether. “Your life is at stake and you have to look out for everyone else as well as yourself,” he said during a luncheon at the VFW Post 1273. Parham became a radio operator for a M-7 tank in 1944, despite having no prior experience. He sat exposed in the turret and gave instructions to the driver and gunner inside the tank. While in action in 1945 and loading ammunition for a 105 millimeter Howitzer, an enemy artillery shell exploded and launched a piece of shrapnel above his left eye. The shrapnel was extracted and Parham spent five months in the hospital in Mindoro before returning to the United States. He later received a Purple Heart. Nathan Dahl, Billy Deruter and former Rapid City Mayor Don Barnett were also recognized on Veterans Day during the Main Street Square ceremony. Former mayor Don Barnett speaks before the Veterans Day Parade on Thursday in downtown Rapid City. Barnett said he got a direct commission in the Army Medical Service Corps branch. He said he was a hospital administrator in Vietnam for a year and a half with 400 beds. Barnett said they always had a population of at least 225 patients. He said he was proud to serve his country. “When my country rang the bell, I was happy and proud to serve,” Barnett said. After he came home from Vietnam, Barnett served two terms as mayor. Billy Deruter speaks before the Veterans Day Parade on Thursday in downtown Rapid City. Deruter served in the National Guard for 21 years and recently retired. She said this is her first Veterans Day as an adult not in uniform. She said when she first enlisted in 2000, she wanted to serve for six years and be done — Deruter wanted to see the world and get college assistance. However, it quickly changed after the 9/11 attacks. “I saw poverty that made my stomach quiver,” Deruter said. “Yet it made me who I am today and gave me gratitude and love for the things we have in the places that we live now.” Dahl said growing up he had no idea what a veteran was. He said being a veteran has shaped his life and touched how he talks, acts and the way he holds himself. Dahl said he served for four years. Nathan Dahl speaks before the Veterans Day Parade on Thursday in downtown Rapid City. “When you see a veteran, I want you to just realize that there’s a lot that the military service has done for them and you should thank them from your heart,” he said. “All of the freedoms that you enjoy every day, that comes from the sacrifices they made whether they were deployed, not deployed, whether they were paper pushers or on the front lines.” — Contact Siandhara Bonnet at siandhara.bonnet@rapidcityjournal.com — Get local news delivered to your inbox!

Kevin Cramer, back in Bismarck on Thursday, Jan. 7, after one of the darkest days in American history, said he was disappointed in what was said at President Donald Trump\'s rally before the U.S. Capitol was breached for the first time since 1812. He also, in rather stark terms, said that he would have handled the intruders at the Capitol Jan. 6 in a different way. In a radio interview earlier on Thursday, when Cramer was asked about what he would have done if someone was breaking into the Capitol, he replied, ""If I was in charge of security at the U.S. Capitol and some guy came in busting through the window, I would have put a bullet in his head and thrown him back out the window the other way to show the next person what would happen. But they (the Capitol police) are better trained, and they let them in."" In a later news conference with reporters, he said, ""It\'s not true literally"" that he would have shot someone in the head at the Capitol. He added that the National Guard in Washington, D.C., isn\'t allowed to carry guns. ADVERTISEMENT Ultimately, the rioters who entered and ransacked the Capitol were responsible for their actions, Cramer said, adding they would eventually be identified and tracked down to see what their political leanings were and if they were associated with any organizations. However, he said he was ""disappointed"" in the words of Trump\'s attorney Rudy Giuliani, who used the word ""combat"" in his speech to the rally crowd estimated at 40,000 people at a park near the Capitol before the assault began. ""It\'s a word that has meaning,"" Cramer said. He also said Trump was wrong in calling out Vice President Mike Pence. Constitutionally, Cramer said, Pence had the duty to open envelopes and preside over the congressional certification, but not to change Electoral College votes. The Republican senator said the rally-goers and rioters didn\'t seem to understand that Congress couldn\'t change the Electoral College votes. The reason he didn\'t object to the certification was that, while being a defender of state\'s rights, he, U.S. Sen. John Hoeven and U.S Rep. Kelly Armstrong didn\'t think they had the right to change another state\'s votes. ADVERTISEMENT They do, however, favor a bipartisan commission to look into mostly mail-in voting, Cramer said. Trump urged rally-goers to march to the Capitol, he said. That ""whipped people up,"" and the Trump supporters were passionate. ""But passion isn\'t an excuse for violence,"" Cramer said. He said the rioters ""certainly had encouragement to try to make their case at the Capitol, but a lot of them just took it way too far."" Cramer went on to tell a story about his Uber driver earlier Thursday who told him, in his country of Cameroon the rioters would have been shot before they even got near the Capitol. When asked about whether Trump should be removed from office using the 25th Amendment or through impeachment, he said that would be ""inappropriate, goofy and politically stupid."" Sometimes, ""Trump\'s impulses are extreme,"" he said, and the passion emerges. But Cramer thought the president did the right thing on Thursday after taking a step back, assessing the situation and responding by saying there would be a peaceful transfer of power. The senator said he ""dearly loved"" the president, and he was the ""best president of my lifetime"" for North Dakota and the country. ADVERTISEMENT In the end, though, Cramer said his Trump-supporting friends shouldn\'t try to rationalize what happened at the Capitol.

Home About Us Advertise Business Directory Calendar Extras Football Contest Subscribe Pay Your Bill Online More Tea resident, Julie Frank (pen name Emersyn Park), has always dreamed of becoming an author and writing a book of her own. This year her dream came true. Frank released her first novel titled, “he LOVES me, she loves me NOT.” You may have seen this book on the shelves at Barnes and Noble, but didn’t recognize the author’s name. Frank chose to write her novel under the pen name of Emersyn Park. Frank has lived in the Midwest for the last 25 years with her husband and two sons. Her journey to write and publish a book is a simple one. She has always dreamed of becoming an author like her idols, Gillian Flynn, Colleen Hoover, Dianne Chamberlain, Emily Giffin and Ruth Ware. As a young child, she wrote one-act plays and short stories that her type A personality could control the ending to. In high school her love for reading intensified, and she was often found with her nose in a work of fiction. She also became very active with her high school newspaper and yearbook staffs, where her talent and passion for writing blossomed under the wonderful direction of her journalism teacher. As an adult, many novels crept onto paper but never fully contained Frank’s attention. Her role as a mother was her number one priority. Now that her two sons have grown and become independent, welcomed free time resurfaced. “he LOVES me, she loves me NOT” was born during the COVID19 quarantine. Page, after page, poured out of Frank as if the words had been bottled up and were overflowing. Even though the global pandemic has completely altered our ‘normal,’ it is also credited with giving her the gift of time and opportunity to create an entertaining story that leads its readers to question the basic facts that they were led to believe — not everything is as it appears. We all have a story to tell; whether it’s a great story depends on how you tell it. The Tea Community Library is excited to have Emersyn Park (aka Julie Frank) at the Library Saturday, Oct 30th from 9:30-11:00 for a book signing. Her book can be purchased either at Barnes and Noble or Amazon ahead of time, and there will be copies available while she is here. Refreshments will be served. “We hope you can join us to show support for one of our very own Tea residents,” said librarian Gayla Wipf. © 2023 TeaWeekly \u200b\u200b CAREERS | CONTACT'}]"

SIOUX FALLS (AP) – Minnesota-based Medtronic has agreed to pay $400,000 to South Dakota to resolve allegations that it paid kickbacks to a neurosurgeon, Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg announced Thursday. The settlement resolves allegations that Medtronic paid for more than 100 social events at a restaurant owned by Dr. Wilson Asfora, at Asfora’s request. Medtronic allegedly sponsored the events over a nine-year period to persuade Asfora to use Medtronic products. The agreement is the latest settlement involving Asfora. The former Sanford Health neurosurgeon and two medical device distributorships that he owns also agreed to pay $4.4 million earlier this year to settle allegations that they defrauded the federal government through illegal kickback schemes Sanford Health had already agreed to pay $20 million to settle its role in the kickback scheme. And, last year medical device giant Medtronic agreed to pay $9.2 million for its role in paying kickbacks to Asfora through the restaurant Carnaval Brazilian Grill, which Asfora and his wife owned.

Please give us a call at 605-224-7301 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy A woman wears a mask to slow the spread of COVID-19 while riding a train. A group of residents are trying to persuade members of the South Dakota Legislature to adopt a mask mandate, though members seem very unlikely to approve such a measure. A coalition, calling itself “United Today, Stronger Tomorrow,” supports a statewide facemask requirement. The group of local organizations is launching a sign-on letter for South Dakota residents. It asks the state Legislature to support Senate Bill 125, which requires masks in all businesses across the state “where 6-foot social distancing cannot be achieved or maintained.” According to the United Today, Stronger Tomorrow release, the bill is being brought forward by Sen. Reynold Nesiba, D-Sioux Falls. According to the bill language, the requirement includes no penalty and expires in 100 days, similar to mask ordinances passed in both Sioux Falls and Brookings. Though the bill might not have any penalties attached, Dave Bushaw with the coalition clarified. “So, as we understand the law, a business owner has the right to ask anyone to leave if the business chooses to comply with this mask requirement. Refusal to leave would immediately shift the scenario to a trespassing or another public disturbance issue which, by the discretion and right of the business owner, could involve law enforcement intervention to remove the patron. This is similar to examples such as smoking indoors, not wearing shoes or a shirt, ect.,” Bushaw said. “As for the committee discussions, SB-125 is expected to be assigned to a committee next week as we currently understand.” “The mask requirements have been successfully implemented in cities across the state, including Sioux Falls, Brookings, Vermillion, Huron, and others. They have alleviated the burden on small businesses, kept workers employed, and helped keep local economies operating,” Bushaw added. The sign-on letter can be viewed at https://actionnetwork.org/forms/support-a-south-dakota-statewide-mask-requirement. Was the information in this article useful? Thanks for the feedback.
