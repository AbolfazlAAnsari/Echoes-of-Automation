WHITE SETTLEMENT, Texas - White Settlement police said the man who was featured on Trackdown earlier this week, who is charged with sexual assault of minors, is now behind bars. Steven Skalij faces two felony warrants for sexual assault of a child. Police said Skalij was arrested back in October, but his $500,000 bond was lowered to $100,000. He made that bond, but police found there were additional victims. Related In this week’s Trackdown, White Settlement police are looking for Steven Skalij, who is charged with sexual assault of minors. Skalij had agreed to turn himself in, but he never showed up, police said. White Settlement Police Chief Christopher Cook was on Trackdown to ask for the public\'s help to find Skalij. Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office deputies arrested Skalij at about 1:30 a.m. Saturday. His initial bond was set at $1.5 million on two charges of sexual assault of a child, and it’s since been reduced to $200,000 on those two charges. The move surprised the judge in Tarrant County who issued the initial bond. ""On the second ones, yes. It surprised me. I would have thought with the coverage of the first one, that wouldn’t have happened a second time, but yes, it surprised me,"" Tarrant County Judge Christopher Gregory said. The arrest warrant states Skalij sexually assaulted multiple young girls at a home in White Settlement. Parents of one of the girls reportedly found a graphic video of Skalij and the girl on her cellphone and contacted police. ""Besides our elderly, these are our most vulnerable people in our city and in our nation. We need to be doing a better job at protecting them the best we can,"" Gregory said. This is why Gregory set the initial bond higher. ""That was what warranted increasing it a little bit, in reference to making sure that he wasn’t harming any of the victims again or the public at large,"" he explained. Police said more charges with additional victims are possible. ""It doesn’t surprise me that the police departments are locating or possibly locating more,"" Gregory added.

He said last week that Trump would “burn America to the ground.” He’s also been firm in saying he wouldn’t pardon Trump if he were convicted of a crime, as the former president campaigns amid multiple legal battles. But Christie has struggled to get closer to Trump in the polls, where Trump leads even his closest challengers by double-digits. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling average shows Christie at just 3.3 percent support nationally in the Republican primary, while Trump leads with 64.1 percent. Still, Christie’s team has said it’s ready for the long haul, and the former New Jersey governor in the new ad dismissed calls for the GOP candidates trailing Trump to drop out of the race. “Donald Trump will sell the soul of this country,” Christie warned in the video.

the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon on February 3, 2023 as it hovers over the Central Continental United States. Recovery efforts began short LOS ANGELES - Feb. 4 marks the one-year anniversary the U.S. Air Force downed the infamous Chinese spy balloon which floated above parts of Alaska and the continental U.S. The craft floated at an altitude low enough to be seen with the naked eye, alarming millions of Americans across the country. The surveillance balloon was shot down into the Atlantic near the coast of South Carolina’s Myrtle Beach. Beijing continues to insist the balloon was a civilian object and in no way related to the nation\'s espionage program. China said the balloon was mainly used for meteorological research and went off course due to winds and limited steering capabilities. Despite downplaying the importance of the balloon, China threatened retaliation. In a statement after the craft was shot down, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the use of force by the U.S. was ""an obvious overreaction and a serious violation of international practice. It added: ""China will resolutely uphold the relevant company’s legitimate rights and interests and at the same time reserving the right to take further actions in response."" What exactly is this Chinese Spy Balloon capable of? Mark Chandler with Coastal Carolina University joined LiveNOW from FOX\'s Josh Breslow to share his thoughts. Back in June 2023, the Pentagon said that whatever information the balloon captured was not successfully sent back to Beijing. But the U.S. said that it was a spy balloon without a doubt. Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters at a press conference that while the device had surveillance capabilities, ""it has been our assessment now that [the balloon] did not collect while it was transiting the United States."" ""As we said at the time, we also took steps to mitigate the potential efforts of that balloon,"" Ryder said. In Dec. 2023, Rep. Russell Fry, R-S.C., whose district the balloon was shot down in, introduced legislation to force the Defense Department to submit a report to Congress describing what kind of data was picked up about sensitive U.S. military sites and an analysis of the technology used to build the aircraft and where it came from. ""The Biden administration sat on their hands and let this spy balloon freely fly across the country before shooting it down off the coast of my hometown of Surfside Beach, putting our country’s national security at risk and projecting weakness on the world stage,"" Fry told Fox News Digital Tuesday. ""Almost a year later, we still don’t know the consequences of this administration’s lack of action,"" he added. The report would be due 90 days from the date the proposed Chinese Spy Balloon Assessment Act would become law. Weeks leading up to a contentious election in Taiwan in January, 2023, the island\'s Defense Ministry said they spotted two Chinese balloon flying in the northern region of the country. The balloons crossed the sensitive Taiwan Strait separating the island from China and were detected about 110 nautical miles (204 kilometers) northwest of the northern port city of Keelung on Sunday, the ministry said. Paul Gayes with Coastal Carolina University joined LiveNOW from FOX\'s Josh Breslow to discuss the environmental impact of the downed balloon. It was the second time that month Taiwan reported a Chinese balloon near its territory, after one crossed southwest of Keelung on Dec. 7. Taiwan split from China amid civil war in 1949, but Beijing continues to regard the island of 23 million with its high-tech economy as Chinese territory and has been steadily upping its threat to achieve that goal by military force if necessary.

escuelas y casas de agentes del FBI ha sido detenido en relación con un intento en una mezquita de Florida el año pasado, según documentos judiciales. Alan Winston Filion, de 17 años, fue detenido el mes pasado en su casa de Lancaster, California y extraditado a Florida el martes, según los documentos judiciales. Fue acusado como adulto de cuatro delitos graves, incluidos los cargos relacionados con la denuncia falsa que desencadenó la respuesta de las fuerzas del orden. Noticias de Tejas 24/7 en Telemundo Texas. Mira aquí. Filion se declaró inocente de los cargos. Está detenido sin fianza en el centro penitenciario John E. Polk. Filion está supuestamente detrás de cientos de incidentes de swatting en todo el país dirigidos contra institutos, universidades históricamente negras y los domicilios de agentes del FBI, según una petición presentada por el gobierno para garantizar la detención de Filion en el caso de la mezquita. Incluso habría atacado su propia casa. En mayo del año pasado, agentes de la policía del condado Seminole respondieron a una llamada que decía que estaba armado con una pistola y explosivos y que iba a entrar en la mezquita Masjid Al Hayy de Sanford, Florida para llevar a cabo un tiroteo masivo, según los registros del condado. A su llegada, los agentes dijeron que vieron a una mujer y a sus dos hijos en la entrada del edificio e identificaron la llamada como un engaño tras hablar con ellos, según los registros. Según documentos judiciales recientemente desclasificados y obtenidos por NBC News, la oficina del sheriff del condado de Seminole y el FBI han rastreado los mensajes de Filion en Telegram ofreciendo sus servicios , así como grabaciones de llamadas. Afirman que fue responsable de cientos de incidentes en Luisiana, Maryland, Oklahoma, Pensilvania, Texas y Washington. Los intentos de swatting habrían incluido amenazas de bomba en institutos y en una organización no gubernamental que investiga el extremismo. NBC News informó el año pasado sobre el FBI y su base de datos en línea para el seguimiento y la prevención de swatting que se encuentra en la División de Servicios de Información de Justicia Penal del FBI en Virginia Occidental. Según la declaración jurada de la orden de detención, a raíz de ese reportaje, Filion publicó un diagrama en Internet en el que amenazaba con enviar amenazas de bomba a las instalaciones del FBI en Virginia Occidental y con matar a golpes a jueces de la Corte Suprema y senadores. Poco después, una persona que llamó al 911 afirmó que había escondido tres docenas de bombas de tubo alrededor de las instalaciones del FBI que detonarían en 30 minutos, según la declaración jurada. No se encontró ningún explosivo. En los días siguientes, varios agentes especiales del FBI de las oficinas de Pittsburgh, Oklahoma City y San Antonio, así como el jefe de la División de Servicios de Información de Justicia Penal de Washington D.C., fueron objeto de llamadas de swatting en sus domicilios. Según la declaración jurada de la orden de detención, firmada por un detective de la oficina del sheriff del condado Seminole y un agente del FBI, la voz de la persona que llamó en el incidente de la mezquita coincidía con la de los incidentes de swatting que afectaron a personal del FBI. La declaración jurada también dice que Filion ha publicado muchos comentarios antisemitas en línea y tiene afinidad por ""El Señor de los Anillos"". Afirman que suele referirse a las mismas armas, como AR-15 y bombas de tubo, en sus llamadas, además de hacer referencias a Satanás. También alegan que incluso han encontrado mensajes en los que Filion ha admitido haber hecho swatting en su propia casa, dicen los documentos. Filion y su padre accedieron a una entrevista, pero cuando los agentes preguntaron a Filion si había matado a su propia casa, su padre se mostró confuso y Filion se enfadó y dio por terminada la entrevista, según los documentos judiciales. Un abogado de Filion no respondió inmediatamente a una solicitud de comentarios. En un comunicado, el sheriff del condado Seminole, Dennis Lemma, se refirió a la detención para señalar los peligros del swatting. La declaración jurada de la orden de detención señala que el swatting, que consiste en la denuncia falsa de un delito en curso para atraer a las fuerzas del orden a un lugar determinado, es peligroso tanto para los agentes que responden como para las víctimas y puede provocar la muerte accidental de éstas. Según la declaración jurada, las operaciones de espionaje también consumen importantes recursos policiales y de emergencia. ""El swatting es un delito peligroso y sin sentido, que pone vidas inocentes en situaciones peligrosas y consume valiosos recursos"", declaró Lemma. ""No se equivoquen, seguiremos trabajando incansablemente en colaboración con nuestros socios policiales y el poder judicial para detener a los autores de swatting"". El swatting también es difícil de localizar, ya que quienes realizan las llamadas fraudulentas a menudo utilizan tecnología para disfrazar su voz, la información sobre la persona que llama y su ubicación. El swatting se convirtió en noticia nacional tras varios incidentes de gran repercusión protagonizados por miembros del Congreso, la Casa Blanca y la exembajadora ante las Naciones Unidas Nikki Haley, que aspira a la candidatura republicana a la presidencia. Haley fue objeto de dos incidentes recientes en su casa de Carolina del Sur. Ambos casos se cerraron sin que se produjeran detenciones. Para leer la nota original de NBC News, haz clic aquí.'}]"

The White House declined the network’s request for an interview with the president before the big game, which will air at 6:30 p.m. EST. The Super Bowl is expected to be watched by tens of millions of people around the world. It will be the second consecutive year Biden has not sat for an interview with the network broadcasting the game, a practice that had become somewhat regular tradition in recent years. Last year, Biden declined to sit for an interview with Fox News after granting interviews to the network broadcasting the game in each of his first two years in office, NBC and CBS. Other presidents have also skipped the pre-Super Bowl interview in years past. Former President Trump declined to sit down with NBC News before the 2018 game, Variety noted. This year’s Super Bowl is expected to net tens of millions of viewers for CBS, given recent buzz around pop star Taylor Swift, who is dating Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce.

It\'s also been a major topic in many of your calls to our Scripps News Viewer Hotline. Carol from Minnesota said: ""So you folks are the winners when it comes to the New Hampshire primary. It’s been on all day with me. All of us people with antenna TV thank you, because none of the other stations give a hoot."" Some other viewers had different thoughts. Darius from Illinois said: ""I’m calling about your coverage of the primaries. This is only the second state and already we’ve been bombarded 24/7."" The sheer volume of input we\'ve received about national politics and the remaining presidential candidates shows that many of you are interested in our in-depth political coverage — particularly during a pivotal primary. In fact, some of you want to see even more. SEE MORE: Trump coverage dominates viewer feedback However, we did receive some criticism for breaking away from former President Trump\'s victory speech after the New Hampshire primary. Liz said: ""I just wanted to let you know that I watched last night and you all played Haley’s full speech, but you didn’t play Trump’s and I will never watch you again."" Liz is correct. We ran former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley\'s speech in full and dipped out of the former president\'s speech while it was in progress. But the circumstances here are important to note. Both speeches were given approximately the same amount of airtime — around 10 minutes each. Also, before we cut away from Trump, you\'ll see that he had handed the microphone to a surrogate — former Republican presidential candidate Tim Scott. Therefore, we made the decision to cut away from the speech and provide important context about it, as well as the evening\'s primary results from our reporting team.

A report from the Associated Press said records showed Deborah Lyn Clenney, 57, and Kim Dewayne Clenney, 60, were taken into custody Tuesday in Austin. They were both charged with unauthorized access to a computer, the AP stated. EverythingLubbock.com previously reported Courtney, who was born in Midland, was accused of stabbing Obumseli, her boyfriend, to death in Miami on April 3, 2022. Charges were not immediately filed, but police eventually issued an arrest warrant for Courtney and charged her with murder four months after Obumseli’s death. According to the AP, prosecutors said Obumseli and Courtney, who went by “Courtney Tailer” on Instagram and OnlyFans, had a “tempestuous and combative relationship” that began in November 2020. Courtney had previously claimed she was acting in self-defense at the time of the stabbing. Previous reports said Courtney claimed she threw the knife from about 10 feet away after Obumseli had pushed her to the floor. However, the medical examiner said Obumseli’s injuries could not have been caused by a knife thrown at that distance. Investigators believe Courtney gave her parents Obumseli’s computer at some point between the killing and her arrest, the AP reported. Court documents revealed detectives found messages where the parents discussed trying to gain access to the computer. As of Thursday, Courtney’s parents were no longer at the Travis County jail.

identified the suspect who was shot and killed by police on Tuesday, Jan. 30 as 23-year-old Chad Hartley. Hartley was killed after barricading himself inside a home at the Santa Fe Trail Mobile Home Community, according to the Temple Police Department. Temple PD told 6 News that around 1:15 p.m., officers were dispatched to the 900 block of S. 9th Street because Hartley was threatening to commit suicide. Before officers could arrive, Temple PD said he left the home with a handgun. According to police, when officers arrived, Hartley pointed the gun at them and then barricaded himself inside a mobile home. Temple PD said officers evacuated nearby homes around the location and established a perimeter to contain Hartley. Temple Fire and Rescue and Temple EMS were also reportedly on scene to assist if needed. Temple PD said they established phone communication with Hartley, who continually refused to put the gun down and leave the home. Police stated that around 2:36 p.m., after several negotiation attempts, Hartley pointed the gun at a drone outside the home and then at an officer through an open window. The officer then reportedly shot and killed Hartley, according to Temple PD. Temple PD says officers then entered the residence to provide aid to the Hartley. He was reportedly pronounced dead at 2:45 p.m. The Temple Police Department stated they called in the Texas Rangers to investigate the officer-involved shooting. The officer involved in the incident has been placed on administrative leave with pay as a matter of standard practice, said Temple PD. An internal affairs investigation has reportedly been ordered as well. The case is under investigation, according to Temple PD. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Temple Police Department at 254-298-5500 or the Bell County Crime Stoppers at 254-526-8477 or bellcountycrimestoppers.com.

But until the early part of the 20th Century, the United States was deeply segregated. That’s when millions in the Jim Crow South decided uproot their lives, hoping to live the American Dream. A few months after the Confederate army lost the Civil War, the 13th Amendment was signed, abolishing slavery in the United States. But in the nearly 100 years between the signing of the 13th Amendment and the signing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, something happened that would go on to shape the nation. At the beginning of the 20th Century, 90% of the African American population lived in the South, under conditions that can really only be described as oppressive. Author Brett Gadsden teaches history at Northwestern University. “Lynchings were fairly common occurrence,” he said. “Race riots were a fairly common occurrence. I think so common that we ought to kind of consider them a normal way of being in the Jim Crow South. … And African Americans are looking for a way to fight back. Looking for ways to participate in the democratic process to overturn this system as American citizens.” As Ethan Michaeli, author of “The Defender: How the Legendary Black Newspaper Changed America” points out, what would come to be known as The Great Migration started with great journalism. “Publishing was a fraught enterprise for African Americans in the South, but people did it very courageously and often times risked their lives to publish information that they felt their readers needed to have,” he said. “There were a lot of publishers that had to flee after they published something and there were people who weren’t able to flee and were caught and were killed. … The Defender was unique for decades really, in exposing the horrors of Jim crow segregation in the South.” Launched in 1905, by Robert S. Abbott, the Chicago Defender started as a weekly, at first, distributed by Pullman Porters, which gave the paper the same reach as the railways, making its way deep into the segregated South. “African Americans were literally running for their lives,” Gadsden said. “What makes The Great Migration so important in the larger history of African Americans and the United States in general is the sheer enormity of the numbers.” During the first wave of the great migration, between 1910 and 1940, it’s reported that nearly two million Blacks left the South. “Aa when they migrated to these northern cities, they faced many new challenges and some challenges that look a lot like the ones there were forced to flee,” Gadsden said. “The problem of police violence seemed to follow African Americans wherever they went, housing segregation, school segregation … I don’t think they were under any delusions that this was in a literal sense a promised land.” “African Americans yes, are coming to the North because there are jobs, there are jobs in the North, there are opportunities in the North that are not available in the South,” Michaeli said. “But to be frank, they’re coming at a time that there are jobs in the South as well. There are steel mills in Birmingham just like there are in Gary, Indiana. The difference is in the North there is the opportunity to vote and to organize and participate in the political process in a way that is not available in the South.” “I think it’s important to understand the emergence of these new concentrated, and in quantitative terms, pretty robust Black voting blocks,” Gadsden said. “We begin to see white elected officials begin to address the questions and concerns of their Black constituency, who can vote. And if Black voters didn’t have the option to vote for black representatives they certainly were positioned strategically to weigh in and determine the fate of one or another white candidate. … So much about aa and the ways they’ve resisted their conditions, the ways in which they’ve resisted racial subordination, and White Supremacy is about perfecting the union. … It reveals to us the ways in which African American history is national history.” National Association of Black Journalists President Ken Lemon says the Black press is proud to continue pushing for justice for all. “There’s always more work to do. Every now and then when I talk to people who have the opportunity to be in the media I say I am my ancestor’s wildest dreams. And then there’s always that caveat, but if our ancestors knew what we were capable of today, would they stop here?” Lemon said. “Are we doing enough to say that we’ve stretched the bounds the way The Defender did? Are we doing enough to ensure that coverage duplicates what The Defender was doing at its station in time? So, the challenge never goes away.” In all, it’s believed that 7 million people moved from the South to the North between 1910 and 1970. Half a million stayed in Chicago.

(WWTV) - A 13-year-old Michigan boy is being hailed a hero for his actions when his grandmother was having a medical emergency. “It was really bad. She had pains in her chest, and she was grunting in pain. She was really sweaty. She was like red, like a tomato, like hot. And she was like, puffing up her chest and stuff,” Wyatt Perrin said. Wyatt said he’s had prior experiences with his grandmother having diabetic sugar attacks, but he sprang into action when this most recent one seemed worse than the others. “I’ve never seen that in my entire life. Mostly it’s just sweating and slurring her words, but not ever puffing her chest up in pain like that. Never seen that,” Wyatt said. The teenager’s dad is a Lake County sheriff’s deputy, and he considered calling him but called 911 instead. “If I call my dad, it’s going to take a minute because he could be on a call. He could be there at the office doing work,” Wyatt said. “But if I call 911, it’ll take less time because they have responders that aren’t doing anything and that could come out.” Wyatt also comforted his grandmother who was in pain until emergency responders arrived. “I was holding her hand saying, ‘It’s all right, Grandma. I got you. They’ll be here soon. Don’t worry, all right,’” he said. His grandmother, 78-year-old Mary Perrin, said she doesn’t remember much of what happened but is grateful. She called Wyatt a hero and her guardian angel. “We just hugged for quite a while. He didn’t want to let go of me, and I didn’t want to let go of him,” she said. “Without him calling 911, I would have probably died.” Wyatt’s dad, Rick Perrin, said that being in law enforcement, he was impressed that his son stayed so calm. He’s one proud papa. “I listened to the 911 tape and I was a little taken aback by how calm and collected Wyatt was during that entire event and given his age, I’ve seen adults do way worse than communicating to 911,” Rick Perrin said. Wyatt said he knew remaining relaxed was critical to saving his grandmother’s life. “If I was panicking, then they wouldn’t have gotten their information that fast and I would have forgotten most of the things and it would be really hard for them to get to me,” Wyatt said. Wyatt’s dad said being calm is out of character for Wyatt and that his son really went above and beyond in this situation. Copyright 2024 WWTV via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.'}]"

AUSTIN, Texas (The Texas Tribune) - The University of Texas at Austin is investigating four current and former students after a tense exchange in which the students demanded administrators reinstate two teaching assistants who were dismissed last year amid on-campus disputes over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Administrators have described the Dec. 8 incident as disruptive and potentially illegal. But the students under investigation say that characterization is overblown. They accuse UT-Austin officials of trying to quell their First Amendment right to protest and say the investigation is an example of how the university is targeting students who express support for Palestinians and Palestinian students. “This is an attack on the civil liberties of all UT students,” Evan Scope-Crafts, a Ph.D. candidate and one of the students under investigation, told The Texas Tribune. “This is an attack on anybody who’s trying to fight for the rights of oppressed groups in the United States and abroad.” The four students are Scope-Crafts, Valkyrie Church, Sameeha Rizvi and a student who wishes to remain anonymous. They received letters on Jan. 17 stating the university is investigating them because they “intentionally caused a disruption” inside a school administrator’s office. The letter, provided to the Tribune by the students’ lawyer, said the students possibly violated university policies related to disruptive conduct, failure to comply with directives from officials and unauthorized entry into university buildings. It also says the university is investigating the students for potentially violating local, state or federal laws, but does not specify which laws. “It seemed to be a chance, once again, to just censor and stop students from being able to organize effectively, especially where the administration doesn’t want to listen,” said Rizvi, who graduated from UT-Austin in December and is one of the four students under investigation. UT-Austin did not respond Friday to a request for comment or questions about how administrators say the students’ exchange with Cole transpired. According to Scope-Crafts and Rizvi, a group of 10 to 15 students entered the office suite for Allan Cole, the dean of the Steve Hicks School of Social Work, and were greeted by the administrative staff. They then entered Cole’s office, which was unlocked, and started reading a letter to him. In the letter, they demanded UT-Austin reinstate the teaching assistants who were dismissed last year and publicly state its support for “protecting freedom of speech for Palestinian and pro-Palestinian students on campus.” Both students said Cole was on the phone when they entered his office. When the group of students read the letter, they said, Cole walked out of the room, went to another office and locked the door. Rizvi said they handed the letter to his secretary and headed to a protest happening outside, where dozens of students were also voicing their concern with the school’s decision to remove the teaching assistants. Scope-Crafts said UT police showed up to the protest and started asking him questions about what happened inside the dean’s office. He said he spoke to police briefly before rejoining the protest. The Dec. 8 protest stemmed from the university’s decision last November to dismiss two teaching assistants after they sent a message to their students sharing mental health resources for students affected by the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The message also condemned the university for its “silence around the suffering many of our students, staff and faculty are experiencing.” The school removed the teaching assistants from their positions stating that their message was “inappropriate” and “unprompted.” The teaching assistants’ dismissal occurred amid escalating tensions at college campuses across the country as students have clashed over their support of Israel and Palestine and demanded university leaders take a stand on the fraught and devastating conflict. At UT-Austin, some students called on university leaders to provide more support and protections for Palestinian students on campus. Around that time, Gov. Greg Abbott urged university leaders to protect Jewish students. “You have a leadership responsibility to ensure that there was no one on your campuses that are advocating for genocide or anti-Semitisim,” he told a crowd at a higher education conference in Austin in December. “It is completely unacceptable in the state of Texas, period.” Ever since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack, some UT-Austin students have expressed their discontent with university leaders’ response to the conflict. Students said they were especially upset that the university did nothing to protect Palestinian students or show support after a group of men who appeared to be unaffiliated with the university interrupted a student meeting of the Palestine Solidarity Committee on Oct. 12 and started intimidating students, calling them “fucking terrorists.” Students who were shaken by that event called on the university to condemn the harassment, but administrators stayed silent. The following day, President Jay Hartzell sent a message to the UT-Austin community announcing increased security for Jewish groups on campus, a move that left Palestinian students and their supporters feeling ignored. The teaching assistants, Callie Kennedy and Parham Daghighi, were dismissed from their positions with pay shortly after, following a grievance filed with Cole about their Nov. 16 message. Cole said they would not be reinstated as teaching assistants the following semester. Kennedy and Daghighi were later offered research assistant positions for the spring semester, but told the Tribune their dismissal still amounted to punishment. Students who joined the protest on Dec. 8 said the university’s decision to remove the teaching assistants was an “outsized reaction” and accused the university of suppressing academic freedom, a longstanding principle on college campuses that protects faculty’s speech and research from outside political interference. Days after the students approached Cole in his office, UT-Austin said on social media the university was investigating multiple incidents they believed to be unacceptable. “Protestors crossed the line of acceptable behavior and violated University rules multiple times this week,” the university posted on the social media platform X. “We will not tolerate disruptions to the teaching and research activities of our students, faculty and staff; our campus; or events. We are investigating and will punish those found to violate our rules, policies or the law.” The post does not specifically mention the Dec. 8 incident, but links to an Austin American-Statesman article about the protest and said the “actions taken toward a University leader on Friday stem from intentionally false narratives and a coordinated disinformation campaign. We will protect speech, but we will not tolerate harassment, disruption, and dishonesty.” Two days before the protest outside the school of social work, students also briefly interrupted a university-sponsored event with writer Bari Weiss, one of the founders of the recently created University of Austin, who was invited to campus to discuss the events in Israel and Gaza. Scope-Crafts and Rizvi said they did not hear from the university again regarding the incident at Cole’s office until the first week of the spring semester when they received a letter from Katie McGee, executive director of the university’s Student Conduct and Academic Integrity department. McGee alerted them they were under investigation and that the university had scheduled a meeting with the students on Jan. 22. There, the office would share information they received related to the incident and allow them to respond. According to UT-Austin’s student disciplinary procedures, the school is now expected to provide a ruling in the matter, called an administrative disposition. That document typically includes the university’s investigative findings, any sanctions and options for a resolution. Students can appeal the ruling in a hearing. According to Scope-Crafts, Rizvi and their lawyer, George Lobb, who attended the meeting, university administrators would not exclude suspending or expelling the students as possible disciplinary measures. Scope-Crafts said the administrators “failed to engage in any meaningful way regarding the facts of the case.” “They basically wanted us to admit that our conduct was disruptive, violated university policy, and so on, and apologize for it,” Scope-Crafts said. “We don’t think we’ve done anything wrong,” he added. “We delivered a letter. That was it. And we were fighting or continuing to fight for what we believe is right.” The students said they are still waiting for the university to rule on the case. Scope-Crafts said UT-Austin and colleges across the country have a long history of civil disobedience and peaceful protests, many of which could be considered far more disruptive than the Dec. 8 incident. “For us to be facing charges including disruptive conduct, unauthorized entry, failure to comply, and unspecified violations of local law for simply reading a letter … It’s honestly an astonishing act of hypocrisy by the university,” he said.
