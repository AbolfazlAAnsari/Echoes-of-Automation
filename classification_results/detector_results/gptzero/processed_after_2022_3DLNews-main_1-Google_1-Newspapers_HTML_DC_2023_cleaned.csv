Indian Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has repeated his resolve to gut the current H-1B lottery system replacing it with merit based legal immigration if he wins the White House. “It’s a lottery. Why on earth would you use a lottery when you could just use meritocratic admission instead, restore merit,” he said during an appearance on “Fox News Sunday.” The 38-year-old biotech entrepreneur was responding to host Shannon Bream’s question about why he wanted to gut “the very system that you used in the past to hire high school foreign workers for the pharma company that built much of your wealth.” READ :Vivek Ramaswamy makes hay as the sun shines on him (August 25, 2023) “You’ve called it a form of indentured servitude that can only accrue to the benefit of the company. So why did the company you start use that 29 times in the last five years?” Bream asked referencing Ramaswamy’s interview with Politico a day earlier. “I believe the energy system in this country and energy regulation needs drastic reform too. But I still use water and electricity and turn on the lights,” Ramaswamy responded. “So the fact of the matter is I have an understanding of the regulatory apparatus because I have dealt with it as a CEO and an entrepreneur who’s built multiple companies. What I think is we need to replace the H-1B lottery system. “That’s what people need to appreciate. It’s a lottery. Why on earth would you use a lottery when you could just use meritocratic admission instead, restore merit,” Ramaswamy said. “There’s also lobbying based provisions where companies who sponsor somebody, that H-1B immigrant cannot work for a different company unless they actually have a whole bureaucratic process to go through,” he noted. “We have to gut that system, restore meritocratic immigration, which is skills, not just tech skills, but all kinds of skills to match the needs we have in this country, but also civic commitments to this country,” Ramaswamy said. “Take the citizenship test on the back end. I say move it to the front end even to get a visa,” he said. READ: Vivek Ramaswamy advocates national holiday for single-day voting (August 9, 2023) “So yes, Shannon, I come from a place of understanding. And I’ve played within the rules that have been given to us by the government, but part of my job as US president is to reform those rules to help all Americans. “And I won’t apologize for restoring merit,” said Ramaswamy. “And de-bureaucratizing that legal immigration process. From 2018 through 2023, US Citizenship and Immigration Services approved 29 applications for Ramaswamy’s former company, Roivant Sciences, to hire employees under H-1B visas, which allow US companies to employ foreign workers in tech and other specialized jobs, according to Politico. “The lottery system needs to be replaced by actual meritocratic admission. It’s a form of indentured servitude that only accrues to the benefit of the company that sponsored an H-1B immigrant. I’ll gut it,” he told Politico, adding that the US needs to eliminate chain-based migration. “The people who come as family members are not the meritocratic immigrants who make skills-based contributions to this country.” When asked about the mismatch in Ramaswamy’spolicy stance and his past business practices, press secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Politico the role of a policymaker “is to do what’s right for a country overall: the system is broken and needs to be fixed.” READ: White House asks Congress to revamp outdated H-1B visa program (August 29, 2023) “Vivek believes that regulations overseeing the U.S. energy sector are badly broken, but he still uses water and electricity,” she said in a statement. “This is the same.” In recent years Indian professionals have cornered over 70% of highly sought-after H-1B visas. For fiscal year 2021, US businesses submitted 780,884 applications for just 85,000 available slots, jumping by more than 60 percent. Ramaswamy acknowledged his own experience with immigration during his opening remarks at the first Republican debate in Milwaukee. “My parents came to this country with no money 40 years ago,” he said. “I have gone on to found multi billion-dollar companies.” In the Fox News interview, Ramaswamy also pushed back on polls that show his rising unfavorability among voters, claiming “people are annoyed by my rise.” “The reality is many people are annoyed by my rise and believe that a 38-year-old is too young to be US president.” Bream referenced an opinion piece published in The New York Times last month, which wrote, “Of all the descriptors attached to Vivek Ramaswamy, the 38-year-old political tyro enjoying a bizarre surge in the Republican primary race for second place, the most common one seems to be annoying.” Ramaswamy said his campaign has taken “intense criticism” over the last several weeks. “This is part of the process, so I invite the open debate,” Ramaswamy continued, echoing his past comparison of himself to founding father Thomas Jefferson in discussions about his age. “The fact of the matter is Thomas Jefferson was 33-years-old when he wrote the US Declaration of Independence,” Ramaswamy said. “He also invented the swivel chair while he was at it, by the way. And so, I think we need to revive that spirit.” Bream also touched upon former President Trump’s commanding lead in a recent GOP primary poll by Fox News, which showed Trump securing 60% of the Republican primary vote, compared to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis with 13% and Ramaswamy with 11%. Asked about the point of his campaign as he and other Republican candidates struggle to catch up to Trump, Ramaswamy remained confident in his success. “We came from 0.0 percent to where we are now. I think we’re on track to win this election,” Ramaswamy said.

Riley on December 27, 2023 @JRileyMW A Republican congressman has proposed a bill to prevent child welfare agencies from turning away prospective foster and adoptive parents who refuse to recognize transgender and nonbinary children’s identities. U.S. Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) introduced the bill earlier this month in response to a proposed rule from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The rule would require child welfare agencies to place LGBTQ-identifying children in homes where they will not be mistreated or abused due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. Caregivers for LGBTQ children would be required to receive training on how to provide for any unique needs those youth may have because of their identity. Banks has condemned the rule as discriminatory, impacting prospective parents who do not support the idea of transgender identity or who oppose homosexuality based on their religious beliefs. “The Biden administration is cruelly preventing countless children in the foster care and adoption system from going to loving homes just because parents are opposed to irreversible sex change procedures on kids,” Banks told Fox News Digital. “This isn’t a liberal or conservative issue. This is just plain wrong, and every sane person knows it.” Banks has instead proposed the Sensible Adoption for Every Home Act (SAFE), which would ensure that families that are headed by parents who hold anti-LGBTQ views are not rejected as foster parents. It would enforce that by prohibiting placement agencies that refuse to place LGBTQ children with otherwise qualified couples from receiving federal funds. Even though social transition does not necessarily involve medical interventions, Banks — like many Republicans pushing anti-transgender legislation — equates affirmation with pursuing surgical and hormonal treatments. His bill also seeks to protect parents who oppose psychological treatments or counseling for trans-identifying children, or refuse to use gender-affirming pronouns, from being discriminated against by placement agencies. Other Republicans have attacked the HHS rule, with 18 Republican attorneys general signing a letter opposing the proposed change, reports Fox News. The attorneys general claim the rule change oversteps HHS’s authority, effectively discriminates against people who practice the Christian faith, in violation of the First Amendment, and potentially harms children by limiting the number of available foster homes where LGBTQ children can be placed. As much as Republicans claim it’s unfair to discriminate against non-affirming parents, 13 states currently have laws that allow placement agencies to reject same-sex couples, single or unmarried parents, older opposite-sex couples, interfaith couples, and other prospective parents based on their purported religious beliefs. Such “conscience clause exemptions” were especially popular over a decade ago in conservative-leaning states, even though allowing such rejections also reduced the pool of potential placements for children in the foster care system. Additionally, 21 states have passed bills that prohibit minors from accessing the kind of gender-affirming treatments that Banks rails about in touting his bill, which could potentially make the issue moot, regardless of a foster parent’s personal views. In Congress, Banks has amassed a record that is hostile to LGBTQ rights. He previously co-introduced a bill to allow adults who experience “regret” after undergoing transition-related treatments as youth to sue their former doctors. He introduced another bill earlier this year, in conjunction with Sen. Marco Rubio, seeking to ban transgender individuals from serving in the U.S. military. Last year, Banks submitted a discharge petition to force a vote on a bill to bar transgender women and girls from participating in female-designated sports. Banks was also previously banned from Twitter, prior to Elon Musk’s takeover of the platform, for deliberately misgendering Adm. Rachel Levine, the country’s first transgender four-star admiral with the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and the Assistant Secretary of Health at HHS. By John Riley on April 24, 2024 @JRileyMW Ohio Republican Attorney General Dave Yost is appealing a judge\'s decision to block the state from enforcing its ban on gender-affirming care for minors and a ban prohibiting transgender athletes from competing on female-designated sports teams. Yost filed an emergency motion with the Ohio Supreme Court asking it to overturn a temporary restraining order issued by Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Michael Holbrook, which blocked the law\'s provisions from taking effect for two weeks. Holbrook, a Republican appointee, found that two transgender minors and their parents, who sued to challenge the law in court last month, were likely to suffer ""immediate"" harm, in the form of reduced access to health care providers willing to treat their gender dysphoria, if the law -- which imposes penalties on doctors who prescribe gender-affirming treatments -- were to take effect. By John Riley on May 7, 2024 @JRileyMW An Arkansas trans advocacy group\'s community has been vandalized for at least the fifth time in the past year. The repeated attacks come as Arkansas lawmakers continue to spout anti-transgender rhetoric and push anti-LGBTQ policies. The most recent of these was an executive order by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders that refuses to recognize transgender identity as valid and restricts access to single-sex spaces based on a person\'s assigned sex at birth. The Little Rock-based InTRANSitive has seen repeated acts of vandalism against its community center since opening in December 2021. The vandalism appears to have increased as the organization has become more visible, with its members and staffers speaking out against proposed laws targeting transgender people.

Eisenhower in the Persian Gulf on Dec. 1, 2023. The Eisenhower and its carrier strike group are deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations. (Janae Chambers/U.S. Navy) NAPLES, Italy — The Navy’s decision to keep two aircraft carriers near Israel will make it difficult to meet maintenance schedules unless one returns home by early next year, analysts say. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered USS Gerald R. Ford and the cruiser USS Normandy to remain in the region for several more weeks, The Associated Press reported Friday. Ford deployed from Norfolk, Va., in May, but had its November homecoming delayed following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower arrived in the region in October for its scheduled deployment. Beyond their immense combat and surveillance capabilities, the aircraft carriers serve as a potent political symbol of support for Israel, which has been criticized for civilian casualties and the displacement of most of Gaza’s population during its war to annihilate Hamas. But while the aircraft carriers have kept busy, they haven’t pushed their limits. Ford conducted 2,489 sorties, or flights, from Oct. 9 through Dec. 7, Cmdr. Richlyn Ivey, a spokesperson for U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa/U.S. 6th Fleet, said in an Dec. 12 email. Eisenhower tallied 2,051 sorties from Oct. 24 through Dec. 7, she said. That’s a daily average of about 41 for Ford and 45 for Eisenhower. The carriers are designed to surge to as many as 270 and 240 sorties, respectively, over a 24-hour period, according to the Navy. Aircraft carriers USS Gerald R. Ford and USS Dwight D. Eisenhower sail with other U.S. and allied ships sail in the Mediterranean Sea on Nov. 3, 2023. The carriers have flown more than 4,500 sorties since the start of Israel-Hamas war in October, the Navy said. ( Jacob Mattingly/U.S. Navy) The service didn’t offer additional details about the carriers’ activities or operations. Besides flights, the carrier strike groups’ myriad capabilities include long-range missile tracking and intelligence gathering. But the flight activity suggests Ford could return stateside for needed maintenance and crew rest without undercutting U.S. efforts to keep Iran-backed proxies from broadening the war into a regional conflict, analysts say. “The strategic signaling has fulfilled its purpose,” said Johannes Peters, department manager of the Center for Maritime Strategy and Security at Kiel University in Germany. Pro-Iran groups have launched dozens of drone and missile attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria since the war began, while the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen have launched missiles at shipping in the Red Sea. However, Iran’s national forces haven’t publicly entered the fray. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has skirmished with Israel from the Lebanon border. But Peters noted they aren’t heavily engaged in the fighting. At current levels of conflict, two carriers aren’t necessary, Peters said. Ford’s continued deployment could have future impacts upon the larger fleet, according to naval analysts. Maintenance backlogs, crew fatigue and shortages, and shipyard decay were among contributing factors found to be hurting Navy readiness, according to a Government Accountability Office report released in May. “If we try to do it all, everywhere, we will strain the fleet once again and weaken ourselves should a hot war erupt that directly involves the U.S. as a combatant,” said James Holmes, who chairs the maritime strategy program at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I. The Navy still is working through a maintenance backlog left over from the last time the U.S. kept a constant one- or two-carrier presence in the Middle East at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, Holmes said The Navy did not answer Stars and Stripes questions last week about the impact of an extended deployment on Ford’s maintenance schedule. While the dual-carrier operations are a strain on the service, the flexibility to take action is important, said Sebastian Bruns, a naval security expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. For example, there still is the possibility of a noncombatant evacuation operation from Lebanon. And while a carrier deployment sends a political signal to a region, its departure sends one as well, Bruns said. An F/A-18E Super Hornet lands on the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford on Dec. 6, 2023. The Ford Carrier Strike Group is currently operating in the Mediterranean Sea. (Maxwell Orlosky/U.S. Navy) The service has 11 aircraft carriers, of which five are underway or deployed, according to a USNI News report Dec. 11. Two are in various stages of maintenance, according to posts on official social media pages for USS John C. Stennis and USS George H.W. Bush, while USS Harry S. Truman ended its maintenance period Sunday. USS Abraham Lincoln and USS George Washington appear to be readying for future deployment. USS Nimitz is undergoing planned maintenance but is set for decommissioning in 2026, according to the Navy’s 2024 shipbuilding plan. There are some signs the Navy is adjusting its force posture in the Mediterranean and Middle East. Three U.S.-based destroyers transited the Strait of Gibraltar eastbound within the last week. There are 19 Navy ships in the region, including at least seven in the eastern Mediterranean and 12 in the Red Sea, Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf, AP reported Friday. That destroyer presence could pick up where Ford would leave off, analysts say. The Navy’s destroyer fleet has been active in bringing down missiles and drones heading Israel’s way. The USS Mason, USS Carney and USS Thomas Hudner on duty in the Middle East have shot down 38 drones during their deployments, the Navy said Sunday. Carney has shot down 33 drones, the most recent being 14 attack drones heading towards Israel on Saturday. The Navy, citing DOD policy, wouldn’t say how many or the types of weapons Carney and the other ships used in those operations. “The carrier air wings make an important statement that Washington has options, but the destroyers are the workhorses on a daily basis,” Holmes said.

Rania Khan December 7, 2023 I want to preface this by saying, no, I’m not anti-relationships-in-college. But as an observer from the sidelines, watching as my friends go in and out of relationships (that have been tumultuous, to say the least), it’s hard not to develop a slight sense of caution. I’m definitely not a skeptic when it comes to romance—in fact I’d consider myself a hopeless romantic who has too often been swayed by the impractical fairytales rom-coms feed me. And perhaps that’s where the problem lies. But this isn’t about me. It’s about why we all have such a dire need for companionship. It’s getting colder. And all you can think about is the idea of being snuggled up in a blanket, sipping hot chocolate with a significant other, watching The Holiday or Love, Actually on repeat. Something about winter creeping up is enough to make anyone want to trade the “Hot Girl Summer” mindset for a “Settle Down Winter” one. Or better yet, a “Time to Lower my Standards” mindset, as I like to call it. The need to be in a relationship can be so completely consuming that people will be quick to view themselves as the problem and lower their standards, when it’s more about luck and timing. Furthermore, this downgrade of standards may not be setting them up for a successful and healthy relationship. College is a weird time. You move to an entirely new environment, away from your family and everything familiar to you, and are expected to forge a future for yourself within four years. Not only that, but as you try to make a new place like Georgetown a second home, you’re also attempting to learn more about yourself. What are you passionate about? Who do you like to surround yourself with? What makes you happy? On top of all this, given Georgetown’s highly competitive student body, you’re left constantly questioning whether or not you have enough on your plate to be “successful,” whatever that means. With all these questions to answer, college serves as a perpetual state of experimentation where who you are and what you want to do with your life are bound to constantly shift based on your experiences. Navigating through this trial-and-error process of self-discovery can be stressful. Sometimes relationships, good or toxic, are learning experiences, illuminating things about yourself you wouldn’t have known otherwise. For me, my first relationship showed me that I valued acts of service and quality time above anything else. Other times, you can grow too reliant on your relationship, allowing it to interfere with your journey of self-discovery. And that’s dangerous. This is the time you’re trying to figure out who you are as a person. In that process of experimentation, relationships can be confounding variables, tampering with the answer to your question. Let’s say a friend of mine was struggling to find recreational activities that excite her outside of her current academic commitments. She starts dating someone and they’re really into gymming, so she tags along. Let’s say she doesn’t really enjoy gymming, but tries to embrace it for her partner, letting go of her search for her actual passions. Or, she loves gymming but is dependent on her partner for physically going there. Relationships can seamlessly complicate self-exploration. Everything about your lives become intertwined, especially in an enclosed space like a college campus. Aside from the intoxicating effect of the cold, and how it seems to erode all logic, it’s easy to view a relationship as a one-stop-shop to fix all your current problems or alleviate all your anxieties. According to a study by the National College Health Assessment, over 85% of college students are reported to have felt overwhelmed by daily responsibilities. Fighting with friends? Let me vent to my partner. Grades taking a dip? I’ll study with my partner. Having a career crisis? Let my partner’s shoulder be the one to cry on. It’s hard to imagine how a relationship could contribute to college anxiety. Another one of my observations (yes, I should find better ways to occupy my time) includes that, more often than not, relationships in college tend to move abnormally fast because of the environment they form in. Everyone’s in what seems like a permanent state of anxiety, which can manifest itself in several ways, from extreme vulnerability, to a desire to be cared for, to flat-out toxicity, to the very human fear of being alone. Being away from family also means trying to create your own on campus through the people you surround yourself with. I loved seeing my family every day when I’d come home, so I’ve translated that to my friendships, and seeing them has become an important part of my daily routine. You might try to give a relationship that same sense of routine even though setting boundaries are important to prevent unhealthy attachment. A lack of boundaries may create a wildly codependent relationship and the illusion of “I can’t live without them,” even though you very well did a year ago. Then again, time doesn’t function normally in college. A week can feel like a year and months flash by in seconds. Someone who’s so ingrained in your routine may feel like they’ve been in your life forever. Within this skewed timeline, you might have undergone a multitude of changes, causing your relationship wants and needs to adjust. Suddenly, you’ve outgrown the person (which is perfectly normal during such an exploratory period), but the stability of being with someone is too comforting to leave. So, am I saying relationships in college are inherently prone to disaster, making them not worth pursuing at all? No! They’re absolutely worth exploring, but similar to the experiment-esque method of finding yourself, relationships deserve the same due diligence. Consider your current capacity, your standards (that should not lower), and boundaries. Relationships don’t need to be viewed as high stakes from the get-go, and casual dating has become increasingly popular for its non-exclusive and minimal effort companionship. Casual dating can be used to better understand yourself, the type of partner you are, and the type of partner you seek. And if casual dating doesn’t sound appealing to you, that’s okay too! You can very well learn about yourself outside of your relationships with others. Taking up a stress-free hobby, reading a new book, or journaling offer opportunities for identity introspection.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Voices By Nikki Farnham March 22, 2023 Shiny things rust, and—like so many former “gifted kids”—that’s what happened to me. I’ve been in public schools since second grade, and I always took the hardest classes offered. It wasn’t something my parents and I really needed to discuss—we just knew I would enroll in courses with the highest level of difficulty. To be fair, I kept setting the precedent, advancing year after year with the same A’s I had been earning since the beginning. The topics became increasingly challenging, and I encountered hurdles, but I was pushing myself hard enough to uphold an image of competency. “Principal’s Honor Roll” wasn’t just on my transcript; it was ingrained in my mind. I genuinely loved learning, but I also became addicted to the euphoria of academic validation. It was in my sophomore year of college, however, that everything came apart. I began experiencing a mental block, if it can be called that. It felt as though my mind was underwater, muffling any and all information I was being taught. If my brain had been a sponge for twelve years, it couldn’t absorb one more drop. Something that should have taken me an hour to memorize was taking me repeated attempts to grasp, and I couldn’t understand why my use of time had become so ineffective. Work smarter, not harder, and I was working so, so hard, with nothing to show for it. I perceived others as 10 steps ahead of me, and I was gasping for air trying to catch up. I wasn’t failing by any means, but being subpar over and over again was silently killing me. I kept wondering if I was devolving into a worse version of myself. How had I gone from feeling relatively in-control to struggling so hard to stay afloat? What I was suffering from, I later realized, was the textbook definition of gifted kid burnout. The Mayo Clinic defines burnout as “a state of physical or emotional exhaustion that also involves a sense of reduced accomplishment and loss of personal identity.” “Gifted kid burnout,” however, is an internet term coined by Gen Z in recent years. Plainly put, it refers to students who were placed in advanced-level classes early in their educational careers, only to discover that they can’t maintain the same degree of academic excellence as they get older. They’ve been straight-A students all their life, their personalities slotting perfectly into the spot at the top of the class. But mediocrity crept up on them, until they feel like they have failed their past selves. And that is exactly how I began to see myself. This skewed self-perception, that my worth was defined by academic performance, is not something that materialized overnight. It had been brewing for years, shaped by my environment and pulled from minor, yet formative, experiences: my high school biology teacher guaranteeing me a 5 on the AP exam, and me getting a 4; my being praised as a perfectionist, as if the need to be exceptional at school wasn’t eating me up inside; a guidance counselor saying my SAT score was a golden ticket to the Ivies (it was not). Comments like these forged a reward system in my head, making me disproportionately attached to perfection and academic validation. I began expecting more and more from myself, and as one journal article explains, “because these personal standards are objectively unreachable, they are associated with the uncomfortable feeling that what has been accomplished is incomplete or imperfect.” Even now, the “gifted kid” in me has this fear of becoming discardable, of not getting a second glance if my grades and scholarly endeavors aren’t impressive enough. Societal expectations have drained me, and rather than recognizing the pressure put on me in schools, I’ve been blaming myself for “losing sight” of who I used to be; as if being called “gifted” at the age of 7 meant I couldn’t be anything less than perfect for the rest of my life. For many of us “gifted kids,” the constant praise became an ongoing reminder of how we were viewed by peers, parents, and educators alike—as the “golden” child, the teacher’s pet, the top of the class. We began defining ourselves by our academic reputation, until a series of missteps was enough to send us spiraling. I was gifted as a child, but I can’t maintain straight A’s now, so everyone was wrong. Part of the issue is that failure isn’t something we’re familiar with—not because things always come easy to us, but more so because our work tends to pay off, a linear relationship that has never let us down. But then it does, and inevitably, burnout. There are those who would point out that not all gifted kids experience burnout. Being a gifted kid doesn’t force anyone to be a straight-A student forever. Nevertheless, we have a lot to unlearn, and it will take time to dismantle what we have built ourselves into. I am a product of a world that views failure as shameful, and I refuse to feed into that. A 2019 study found that unhealthy perfectionism is increasing in college students, something that is bound to exacerbate burnout among young adults. We need to endure, though—not as perfect students, but as people who know our mistakes do not retract from our brilliance or self-worth. I believe the solution to this is two-fold. Internally, we need to restructure our entire mentality about what it means to be “gifted.” In Carrie Soto Is Back, one of my all-time favorite books that tackles perfectionism, Taylor Jenkins Reid muses, “Maybe it’s a lie that you have to keep doing what you have always done. That you have to be able to draw a straight line from how you acted yesterday to how you’ll act tomorrow.” From the minute I read that quote, I let it soak into the recesses of my mind. Maybe I can take a break from putting 110% into everything. Maybe it’s ok that I broke my straight-A streak. I wish I had read that book when I was a senior in high school, dead-set on getting into the Ivies. I wish, as a middle schooler, someone had told me to ingrain that sentiment in my mind, instead of my honor roll distinction. It might have saved me from mounting myself on a pedestal so high I became terrified of falling off. The second part of the solution is external: Society has to stop setting this trap in the first place. Teachers should be more conscious when making comments about how they “expected more” on a score. How about reminding straight-A students that it is perfectly acceptable to fall short on an assignment? Growth is not linear, and getting 96’s on a normal basis does not make a 79 “out of character.” Gifted kids are not machines who can churn out A’s just because they have been doing it forever; teachers need to vocalize this, to reassure students that excelling in school does not mean suffocating under the pretense of perfection. Even more, universities need to do a better job of upholding claims of a “holistic” admissions process. Standardized testing is antiquated in nature, and has reached its expiration date. Many experts suggest that such exams are ineffective measures of knowledge, and I wholeheartedly agree. Pushing students to believe that their future hinges on test performance—especially when that test is supposedly representative of an entire country—is detrimentally wrong. Intelligence cannot be gauged by exams alone, and too much of the college application process is contingent on that. To their credit, schools have begun implementing “mental health days” since the pandemic began—excused absences for students who need a mental, emotional, or psychological break from school. My own county now devotes the third Wednesday of every month to a half-day for mental health. Yet society’s approach to high-achieving students is deep-rooted; it will take much more than mental health days to unravel that.

an anti-gay rant in which he accused same-sex parents who had children through surrogacy of engaging in “human trafficking.” For good measure, the far-right provocateur added that having gay parents was worse for a child than having a limb cut off. During the December 4 edition of The Matt Walsh Show on The Daily Wire, the host, known for his harsh anti-LGBTQ views, discussed Fox News commentator Guy Benson’s recent announcement that he and his partner, Adam Wise, had a child via surrogacy. He blasted Benson for speaking to Parade magazine about the birth of his son, Conrad, and being a new parent, and fellow Fox News hosts for congratulating Benson on the expansion of his family. Walsh asserted that by giving the interview to Parade, Benson and Wise had implicitly opened up the discussion of the issues surrounding gay parenting and surrogacy for public debate — thereby enabling social conservatives, like Walsh, to express horror over their personal decisions. Walsh then ran two clips: one of a British-sounding gay couple talking about their experience with surrogacy and how they selected the egg donor, and the other of a former surrogate giving advice and tips to women on how to approach being a surrogate. Based on those clips, he then cast the very act of surrogacy as a selfish, immoral act akin to human trafficking. “A surrogate contractually signs her uterus over to a third party,” he says in a clip posted online by left-wing media watchdog Media Matters for America. “That third party can contractually require her to kill the child in her womb. The third party controls what she says about her pregnancy. They control what she buys with the allowance that she’s given. And then when the nine months are up, she delivers the child and hands them over to the third party, never to see him again. “The contract has been fulfilled.” Walsh continued, “Now, if you hear all of that, how human bodies are rented for money, babies are exchanged as part of contractual agreements, and you think to yourself, ‘Wow, that sounds an awful lot like human trafficking,’ well, that just means you’re more perceptive than the average moderate conservative who is always on hand to wish a hearty congratulations to gay couples who engage in this trafficking. “Because it is indeed human trafficking by definition.” Walsh also lamented the fate of children born via surrogacy to same-sex couples, noting that the child will lack either a mother or a father for the rest of their life. “The end result [of surrogacy] is that a child is immediately torn away from the woman who birthed him and raised intentionally motherless or fatherless as the case may be,” he said. “The child will be deprived of what he needs, which is both a mother and a father, so that the gay couple can get what they want. This is the essence of the whole practice — exchanging the needs of the child for the wants of grown adults.” Walsh rejected the idea of sympathy for gay couples who wish to have children, asserting that, unlike heterosexuals who cannot conceive by natural means, there should be no structures in place to help same-sex couples become parents. “Homosexual unions are sterile by their nature,” he said. “This is a sign from nature, about as glaring and obvious as signs as you can ever see, that gay couples are not meant to have kids. They’re not meant to have kids because they cannot ever have kids, because kids are meant to have both a mom and a dad.” Walsh then conceded that some children are raised in single-parent homes or even orphaned, but maintained that it’s not the intended plan for human life. He also asserted that that’s why he would never applaud birth announcements from same-sex couples, claiming he’s more concerned about the child’s needs than their parents’ desires. “You know, it’s true that some children grow up with one arm or no arms, but that obviously doesn’t make it any more horrific, or any less horrific or barbaric to intentionally chop a child’s arm off,” he said. “[T]o intentionally design a child to only have one [arm], we would all agree is like — it’s like mad scientist horror. But this is essentially what we’re doing with commercial surrogacy,” Walsh concluded. “Only it’s worse because it’s far better for a child to be raised lacking one of his arms than to be raised lacking one of his parents.” By John Riley on May 18, 2024 @JRileyMW Harrison Butker, the kicker for the Kansas City Chiefs, has given any self-respecting LGBTQ person a reason to cheer against the defending Super Bowl champions next football season. On May 11, Butker, a Georgia native, delivered a 20-minute screed ranting against LGBTQ people and working women as part of a commencement address at Benedictine College, a Catholic liberal arts school in Atchison, Kansas. Butker, a self-professed conservative Catholic, whose hostility towards LGBTQ people is much more severe than that of Pope Francis, the current leader of the Catholic Church, used his address to attack President Joe Biden, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Catholic abortion rights supporters, and LGBTQ people who embrace their identity. By John Riley on May 20, 2024 @JRileyMW Pope Francis criticized religious conservatives who object to the Catholic Church\'s more compassionate overtures toward the LGBTQ community during an interview with the CBS news program 60 Minutes. When Nora O\'Donnell noted that he had previously said that ""homosexuality is not a crime,"" the 87-year-old pontiff responded, ""It is a human fact."" He also clarified to O\'Donnell that his December 2023 announcement allowing priests to bless people in same-sex unions does not constitute an endorsement of same-sex marriage, which continues to be contrary to church doctrine. By John Riley on May 22, 2024 @JRileyMW Republicans in the New Hampshire Senate approved three House bills seeking to restrict transgender rights and curb LGBTQ visibility in schools. Now, all three bills head to the desk of Republican Gov. Chris Sununu for his signature into law. The first bill, which passed along party lines in the Republican-controlled House and Senate, bars transgender females in grades 5 to 12 from participating in girls\' sports in public schools, reports the New Hampshire Bulletin. Sununu, like other supporters of the bill, has previously endorsed the bill\'s underlying tenets, namely, that allowing transgender athletes assigned male at birth to compete on female-designated sports teams is inherently unfair to cisgender female athletes.

national identity Vivek Ramaswamy believes as one who has lived the full American dream, he is well qualified to lead America out of a national identity crisis and give pride to the next generation of Americans. Indian American Republican presidential aspirant says Washington needs fewer professional politicians and more people who have actually had true success in the private sector — like him. READ: Vivek Ramaswamy embraces American nationalist identity for 2024 race (June 7, 2023) “I think we need an outsider in the White House,” he says in a wide-ranging interview with Aziz Haniffa for the American Bazaar explaining why he has directly jumped into the 2024 presidential race. “I think we need fewer professional politicians in Washington, DC, and more people who have actually had true success in the private sector,” says the biotech billionaire who has “built multi-billion-dollar companies from scratch.” Born in Cincinnati to Indian immigrant parents, Ramaswamy, 37, also advocates a stronger partnership with India and believes Narendra Modi “has been an excellent prime minister for India.” “I think what we need in the United States and what we can learn from that experience is Modi is a leader that does not apologize for Indian national identity,” he says. Ramaswamy answered questions ranging from what he stands for, to how he differs from other Republican candidates, his lack of criticism of former President Donald Trump and how he would build a stronger partnership with India. READ: Vivek Ramaswamy wants to raise the voting age to 25 (May 12, 2023) Here is the full transcript of the interview. It has been lightly edited for clarity. Aziz Haniffa: I’ve been following you right from the start. You appeared on Fox News show Gutfeld! and Tucker Carlson. You burst into the political scene with a bang. Instead of using the traditional process of other Indian American politicians, such as former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former South Carolina Gov. and US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who were state legislators, congressmen, and then governors. What makes you apart from them and what triggered your jumping into the fray? I know you were flirting a bit with running for the US Senate from Ohio, for the seat vacated by Sen. Bob Portman. There were people pushing you to run for the Senate. But getting into the big leagues and running for the presidency, what triggered you? Was it your book tour, which was very well received? Vivek Ramaswamy: The reality is that I think we need an outsider in the White House. I’ve lived the full American dream. I think we need fewer professional politicians in Washington, DC, and more people who have actually had true success in the private sector. I’ve built multi-billion-dollar companies from scratch. I’ve built multiple successful companies. I’ve written three successful books. I believe my success in the private sector, as a parent, as the father of now two young sons, as a millennial — I’m the first millennial ever to run for US president as a Republican. For me, I don’t believe in some hierarchy. I believe in looking myself in the mirror and asking myself, “How can I have the biggest possible impact that’s positive on this country ?” And for me, that answer was to lead us out of this national identity crisis that we’re in; to give pride to the next generation of Americans, to my two sons and their generation. And I saw no better way to do that than to lead this country as our next president. And, I think, being an outsider is actually an advantage to accomplishing that. READ: Vivek Ramaswamy: from suspected vanity campaigner to a contender (May 10, 2023) AH: One columnist wrote that you are a vegetarian who throws red meat to the Republican base. Are you a MAGA Republican? VR: I’m an unapologetic America-first, pro-American conservative. What does that mean? I think that, as the leader of this country, I will put the interests of Americans first without apologizing for it. That’s what the leader of this nation should do. If you’re the leader of Japan or Poland or India, for that matter — [That] is what makes Modi a good leader of his country — you should do that when you leave your country. But the trap we’ve fallen into in the United States is, by thinking that, if you’re the US president somehow, it’s your job to look after everyone else’s interests and apologize for your own at home. I reject that. I think the job of the next president is to put America first and I do that in a way that I think will unite this country. But I won’t apologize for it. AH: Why have you become such a culture warrior? You could have spoken about your successful entrepreneurship, taking on the entrenched pharmaceutical industry, starting a hedge fund and going after the likes of “woke” — as you allege — investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard. Why is it that you’ve become such a strong cultural warrior, instead of focusing on what really made yourself into this successful entrepreneur? VR: That’s a label that the media attaches to me, and, I think the media is badly broken. Today, the media thrives on polarization. What I’m talking about is actually a unifying vision for this country. I stand for meritocracy. I stand for unapologetically the idea that, no matter who you are or where you came from, or what your skin color is, that you should be able to get ahead in America, based on your own hard work and commitment, and dedication. I call that pro-merit. Somebody else will call that a culture warrior. The labels don’t matter. I’m clear about what I stand for. I stand for the truth. I stand for the principles that this country was founded on. To me, that’s not a cultural warrior. I think that that’s a pro-American leader. I believe that that’s quietly putting the media to one side and the labels they attach. I think that’s what most Americans are actually hungry for and that’s what I’m delivering.

You’ve not only echoed some of his talking points about a two-tier justice system, but also called on all GOP candidates to take a pledge that, if one of them is elected president, they should pardon Donald Trump. You also called for the Espionage Act to be eliminated. Why is that? Some critics argue that “you’re sucking up to Trump” because you’re hoping for a cabinet position at some point. How do you counter that type of contention? VR: Well, I can tell you flat out that I’m not going to take a cabinet position or any second-best position. I’m running to lead this nation. I know that and many people are sensitive when you draw policy contrasts from them. So many of those other campaigns have been perpetuating that narrative. Frankly, I’ve drawn more policy contrasts from Trump than probably most other candidates in this race. But I draw policy contrasts from the others as well. I think debate makes the Republican Party stronger. I think it makes our country stronger. I look forward to facing off with the other candidates on the debate stage, which I’ve qualified for in late August.

She noted that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have regularly worked to uplift Black and Brown communities, including their fight for voting rights, police reform, and cutting prices at the cash register. “Lowering prices is what the president works on every day,” the press secretary asserted. “The prices of eggs, milk, and [other items] are lower than last year. Used cars and truck prices are down, and we will do everything we can to continue to lower prices. The work continues.” The conversation extended to Biden’s recognition of the Black Press’s significance, with Jean-Pierre ensuring ongoing access to the president for regular engagement and discussions. “The President understands the credibility and importance of the Black Press in conveying messages directly to the community. We are committed to ensuring continuous access and engagement,” affirmed Jean-Pierre. “We’re going to ensure [The Black Press] has access to the president. That’s what he wants—he wants to speak directly to you. This president understands the importance of speaking to the Black Press, and he wants to have regular engagement with all of you, and we’re going to make sure that happens.” Stacy M.

More by Stacy M. Brown 1 Comment Thank you for recording and reporting on this interview with White House Press Secretary, Karine Jeanne-Pierre. She, herself, is a marker of one of Biden’s accomplishments. However, most of the accomplishments noted, aside from the HBCUs, summarily lifted the quality of life for most Americans. Voting rights and the George Floyd legislation have gone nowhere. Supporting significant initiatives that affect Black Americans exclusively, like reparations, is always a challenge beyond the President’s reach (And, Obama was no exception)!

revealed that the number of gender confirmation surgeries in the United States tripled during the three years leading up to 2019, as first reported by the New York Post. Based on records of in-patient and out-patient procedures obtained from two national surgery databases, around 4,550 Americans sought transition-related surgical procedures in 2016, with that number more than tripling to 13,000 by 2019, according to the study, published in JAMA Network Open. The study’s authors attribute the rise in surgical procedures to federal and state laws approved during the Obama administration requiring coverage for medically necessary care, including treatments for gender dysphoria. The study only looked at surgical procedures in the years prior to 2020, and not hormonal interventions intended to assist in a gender transition. In total, about 48,00 individuals underwent surgical procedures from 2016 to 2020, while the overall number of “health system encounters for gender identity disorder” tripled during that same time. “The rapid rise [in gender dysphoria diagnoses] suggests that there will be a greater need for clinicians knowledgeable in the care of transgender individuals and with the requisite expertise to perform [gender confirmation surgery] procedures,” the report says. Following an 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling last month, the Campaign for Southern Equality, in partnership with the Birmingham-based Magic City Acceptance Center and Mobile-based Prism United, began informing transgender youth and their families that they could apply for grants from the Southern Trans Youth Emergency Project. The project is designed to educate Alabama families of trans youth about the now-enforceable law barring minors from accessing gender-affirming care, as well as information about out-of-state providers willing to work with trans youth, and up to $500 to help defray the costs of travel, medication, or other logistics.

As a result, several lower-court rulings blocking the bans from being enforced have been paused. Currently, only one statewide ban, in Arkansas, has been declared unconstitutional on its merits by a federal district judge. Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin has asked that the full 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in St. Louis, Missouri, rehear arguments related to a lawsuit challenging the state’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors. In his brief, Griffin noted that the 6th and 11th Circuit Courts of Appeal have found that states have a right to regulate potentially risky medical procedures, and argued that a lower court judge had wrongly decided that the ban was unconstitutional by applying the wrong legal standard to the case. Following that decision, the attorney general’s office appealed the decision to a three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit, which declined to pause a temporary injunction blocking the state from enforcing the law.
