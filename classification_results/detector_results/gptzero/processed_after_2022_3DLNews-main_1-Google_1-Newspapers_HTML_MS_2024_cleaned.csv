'Disclaimer: Susan Mattison was highly requested and recommended as a Know Your Neighbor feature a few months ago. Due to only publishing one per week, unfortunately time ran out and she sadly passed away before she was able to be featured in the column. Her granddaughter, Hailey, still wanted to make sure her Nana got her special, well-deserved spotlight. In a world that is full of self-interest and haste, there are rare souls who stand out for their kindness and genuine care for others. Susan Mattison was undeniably one of these individuals. Born in Corinth, MS, and having lived in Starkville for the majority of her life, Susan became quickly known throughout the community for her hospitality and compassion. The mother of 4 and “Nana” of 5, touched the lives of countless people in ways that will be forever cherished. Married to her sweetheart, Richard Mattison, for 45 years, she became a larger-than-life community member. Her home was a place where everyone was welcome and no one left hungry or unloved. From neighbors to strangers passing through, Susan treated everyone like family. “We could bring anyone over and she could have never met them before and she would still treat them like they were her own,” reflected Hailey, Susan’s granddaughter. “She loved to give little snacks out and had this big tray she would leave on the table full of cookies, chips, and any little snack you could imagine…She couldn’t stand for anyone to go hungry. She made sure that everyone had something to eat, and liked to make brownies–that was her specialty.” A part of multiple foundations including the SIDS Foundation and the Victims of Domestic Violence Awareness foundation, Susan’s impact reached far beyond the walls of her home. Whether it was helping to organize events at her home church, Meadowview Baptist, volunteering her time to help her grandchildren with any of their projects or attending all of their events to celebrate their accomplishments, or simply offering a kind word to someone in need, she embodied the spirit of compassion in everything she did. Her presence was like a warm embrace, wrapping around those in need and lifting them up with support and grace. “This woman was the strongest person I know,” said Hailey. “She was the one person I knew would keep my secrets…Anyone who knew my Nana would think of her and smile because of how funny and happy she was no matter what she was going through at the time.” For more on this story, read our news edition on Thursday, February 8, or click here to subscribe to our e-edition.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Published 10:54 pm Sunday, February 11, 2024 By The Associated Press LAS VEGAS (AP) — Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs are back-to-back Super Bowl champions. Mahomes threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman in overtime, and the Chiefs rallied to beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, becoming the first repeat Super Bowl champs in 19 years and ninth overall. With pop star Taylor Swift watching boyfriend Kelce from a suite, the Chiefs captured their third title in five years and firmly established themselves as a dynasty. The NFL’s first Super Bowl in Las Vegas was a sloppy, mistake-filled affair that was mostly boring until the back-and-forth fourth quarter and OT. It was the second of 58 Super Bowls to be tied after regulation, and the first played under new overtime rules that ensured both teams got the ball. The Chiefs (15-6) trailed 22-19 after Jake Moody kicked a 27-yard field goal on the first possession of overtime, but Mahomes rallied the Chiefs, completing another impressive comeback in a rematch of the Super Bowl four years ago. Mahomes ran 8 yards on fourth-and-1 to keep the Chiefs’ chances alive and then scrambled 19 yards to set up the winning score, which came 14:57 into the extra period — just before what would have been the second OT. Had the Chiefs not scored on the play, the game would have continued into another overtime period. Mahomes was 34-of-46 passing for 333 yards and two touchdowns, and also led the Chiefs with 66 rushing yards. He was named the Super Bowl MVP for the third time, adding this award to the ones from the Chiefs’ previous two championships in Super Bowls LIV and LVII. The 28-year-old Mahomes becomes the fourth starting QB to win three Super Bowls — joining Brady, Joe Montana, Terry Bradshaw and Troy Aikman — and second-youngest. Mahomes and Reid are now halfway to Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, who won six championships in 20 years together with the New England Patriots and were the most recent team to go back-to-back following the 2003-04 seasons. “With all the adversity we’ve been through this season to come through tonight. … I’m proud of the guys,” Mahomes said. “This is awesome. Legendary.” After he connected with a wide-open Hardman, the Chiefs ran on the field as red-and-yellow confetti fell onto the turf. Hardman said he didn’t realize the game was over. “I blacked out man,” he said. “I forgot we actually won the game.” Mahomes sprinted after him in the end zone and shared the good news. “I threw a touchdown to this dude to end the game, and he looked at me,” Mahomes said. “He had no idea. I said, ‘Dude, we just won the Super Bowl.’ He had no idea. He didn’t even celebrate at the beginning.” The most excitement in the first half came when a frustrated Kelce bumped Andy Reid on the sideline, knocking the Chiefs’ 65-year-old coach a few steps back after teammate Isiah Pacheco fumbled inside the red zone during the second quarter. “You guys saw that?” Kelce said. “I’m going to keep it between us unless my ‘mic’d up’ tells the world. I was just telling him how much I loved him.” The action picked up after a crucial blunder by San Francisco’s special teams set up Mahomes’ 16-yard TD pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling for a 13-10 lead. A punt hit off the foot of the 49ers’ Darrell Luter Jr., and returnman Ray Ray McCloud was unable to scoop it up. Brock Purdy and the 49ers (14-6) answered but they couldn’t make enough plays, denying Mr. Irrelevant an opportunity to go from last pick in the 2022 NFL draft to Super Bowl champion. Purdy was 23-of-38 passing for 258 yards and one touchdown, with no interceptions. San Francisco running back Christian McCaffrey had 160 total yards — 80 rushing and 80 more receiving on eight catches — and scored the game’s first touchdown on a 21-yard pass in the second quarter. Niners wide receiver Jauan Jennings threw the TD pass to McCaffrey and caught one of his own in the fourth quarter, joining Eagles quarterback Nick Foles six years ago as the only players to do both in the Super Bowl. After Moody’s 53-yard field goal gave the Niners a 19-16 lead with 1:53 remaining, Mahomes and Kelce went to work. Mahomes connected with Kelce for a 22-yard gain to set up Harrison Butker’s tying kick, a 29-yarder with 3 seconds left. Butker kicked four field goals, including a Super Bowl-record 57-yarder in the third quarter. Moody had set the record with a 55-yard field goal that opened the scoring, but it only lasted about a quarter and a half. A holding call on Kansas City’s Trent McDuffie extended San Francisco’s opening drive of overtime and Purdy made key throws to drive the 49ers to the Chiefs 9. But San Francisco settled for a field goal. San Francisco’s Kyle Shanahan fell to 0-2 as a head coach in Super Bowls and 0-3 overall, including a loss when he was offensive coordinator for Atlanta. That was the game in which Brady and the Patriots rallied from a 28-3 deficit to win in overtime. The Chiefs were hardly dominant during the regular season and entered the playoffs as the AFC’s No. 3 seed. They won at Buffalo and at Baltimore in the postseason — the first road playoff games of Mahomes’ career — and entered the Super Bowl as 2 1/2-point underdogs, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. “The Kansas City Chiefs are never underdogs. Just know that,” Mahomes said. Do you think the new Vicksburg animal shelter will be worth the wait? View Results'}]"

Blige, Mariah Carey, Cher, Lenny Kravitz, the late Sinéad O’Connor and heavy metal\'s so-called Prince of Darkness are some the 2024 nominees for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, a wide musical net that also includes the pop-soul of Sade and Britpoppers Oasis. Ozzy Osbourne, who led many parents in the 1980s to clutch their pearls with his devil imagery and sludgy music, gets the nod as a solo artist, having already gone into the hall with Black Sabbath. Nominations also were handed to hip-hop duo Eric B. & Rakim, soft rockers Foreigner, singer-guitarist Peter Frampton, alt-rockers Jane’s Addiction and Dave Matthews Band, and dance icons Kool & the Gang. ""Continuing in the true spirit of rock ‘n’ roll, these artists have created their own sounds that have impacted generations and influenced countless others that have followed in their footsteps,” said John Sykes, Chairman of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation in a statement. Ten of the 15 nominees are on the ballot for the first time, including Carey, Cher, Foreigner, Frampton, Kool & the Gang, Kravitz, Oasis, O’Connor, Osbourne and Sade. Sade, whose 1980s soft rock hits include “Smooth Operator” and “The Sweetest Taboo,” is having a moment, having last year been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Carey, with 19 No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, Blige with eight multi-platinum albums and nine Grammy Awards, and Cher — the only artist to have a No. 1 song in each of the past six decades — would help boost the number of women in the hall. Artists must have released their first commercial recording at least 25 years before they’re eligible for induction. The induction ceremony will take place in Cleveland this fall. Nominees will be voted on by more than 1,000 artists, historians and music industry professionals. Fans can vote online or in person at the museum, with the top five artists picked by the public making up a “fans’ ballot” that will be tallied with the other professional ballots. Last year, Missy Elliott, Willie Nelson, Sheryl Crow, Chaka Khan, “Soul Train” creator Don Cornelius, Kate Bush and the late George Michael were some of the artists who got into the hall. ___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

In the Capitol for a rare weekend session, the Senate voted again to move forward with the assistance as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky issued stark warnings about the consequences of abandoning longtime U.S. allies in Europe. “Today it’s no exaggeration to say that the eyes of the world are on the United States Senate,” McConnell said. “Our allies and partners are hoping that the indispensable nation, the leader of the free world, has the resolve to continue.” Sunday\'s 67-27 vote to move forward on the $95.3 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other countries comes as former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, is trying to kill the assistance and has escalated his attacks on the NATO military alliance. Trump posted on his social media platform over the weekend that the U.S. should consider loaning Ukraine money, not giving it to them, saying that “The United States of America should be ‘stupid’ no longer!” And the former president said Saturday at a campaign rally in South Carolina that Russia should be able to do “whatever the hell they want” to NATO members who do not meet their defense spending targets. He recounted a story he has told before about an unidentified NATO member who confronted him over his threat not to help them. While McConnell has made helping Ukraine a top issue, an increasing number of members in his GOP conference have followed Trump’s lead and are opposing the aid, which Senate leaders have been trying to pass for months. Without mentioning Trump by name, McConnell said in his opening remarks Sunday that “American leadership matters, and it is in question.” Schumer said that if America doesn’t assist Ukraine, “Putin is all too likely to succeed.” “The only right answer to this threat is for the Senate to face it down unflinchingly by passing this bill as soon as we can,"" Schumer said before the vote. Amid shortages on the battlefield, the package would provide $60 billion for Ukraine, mostly to purchase U.S.-made defense equipment, including munitions and air defense systems that authorities say it desperately needs as Russia batters the country. It includes $8 billion for the government in Kyiv and other assistance. It would also provide $14 billion for Israel’s war with Hamas, $8 billion for Taiwan and partners in the Indo-Pacific to counter China, and $9.2 billion in humanitarian assistance for Gaza. The Senate is pushing through several procedural votes on the slimmed-down package after an attempt to pair it with legislation to stem migration at the U.S. border collapsed. Objections from Republicans adamantly opposed to the aid have delayed quick action, forcing the weekend votes as negotiations continue over potential amendments to the legislation. Senators were still trying to negotiate a deal on amendments Sunday but it was uncertain whether they could come to an agreement that would move up a final vote. If there continue to be objections, a final vote could come midweek. Schumer has said he is open to amendments -– most of which would be likely to fail -– but he forced senators to stay in session through the weekend to try and speed up the process. “I can\'t remember the last time the Senate was in session on Super Bowl Sunday,” Schumer said as he opened the session. “But as I\'ve said all week long, we\'re going to keep working on this bill until the job is done.” In Sunday\'s vote, 18 Republicans voted to move forward with the measure — giving supporters optimism that it will eventually pass. But the debate over the aid has deeply divided the Senate GOP conference, with McConnell digging in to support it while some of the most adamant opponents of sending money to Ukraine have increasingly criticized the party leader. “America is being invaded every day at our southern border,” Florida Sen. Rick Scott posted on X, formerly Twitter, as voting got underway. “Why would we vote to send money and resources to secure Ukraine’s border before we secure our own?” Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said the debt is a huge problem, ""and yet they’re wanting to pass a bill to send money we don’t have. So it’s not a sign of strength, and it’s a sign of weakness.” Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said that he can understand the reservations that voters have about voting for foreign aid, but that U.S. senators, who are privy to classified briefings, should understand “what’s at stake if Putin wins.” “And so some people around here if they really are being driven just by the perceptions of their base, they should grow a spine,” he said. Even if the Senate does pass the package, its future is deeply uncertain in the House, where a large majority of GOP lawmakers are firmly allied with Trump. Speaker Mike Johnson has been noncommittal on the aid and has said he wants the Senate process to play out. Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, a former House member who voted to move forward on the aid, noted that some members of the House have threatened to try and remove Johnson, as they did his predecessor Kevin McCarthy, if he holds a vote on Ukraine. Still, “Speaker Johnson is now sitting in classified briefings that he hadn’t had the privilege to sit in” before he was speaker, Mullin said. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

members on the Marshall County zoning board, community opposition to rezoning of a 94-acre tract of land in the Barringer Road and Farley Road was approved unanimously. The rezoning request by John Porter of the parcel has met strong community opposition because residents are concerned about the density of the housing the developer will build, about increased traffic, flooding and other concerns. There were seven objections to the rezoning of the property from RE to R3 and the names of 15 additional objectors not included in the original seven were received at zoning. The zoning board reminded the community group that the rezoning does not have any bearing on the developer’s plans to construct new homes on the property. Kurt Sanders was appointed by District 2 supervisor Johnny Walker to replace Joe Hurdle on the zoning board. David Johnson was appointed by District 5 supervisor Ronnie O’Neil Bennett to replace J.R. Wilson. At the February 5 board of supervisors meeting, Bennett replaced his zoning board appointee with Greg Work. The other members of the zoning board are Bobby Bonds representing District 3, Clista Ash representing District 1 and Kent Falkner representing District 4. Robert Reaves, of Arlington, Tenn., spoke first representing John Porter. Reaves said the development would have 45 homes on the site and have smaller lots than those usually built in Residential Estates zones. “We also have an industrial site nearby,” he said, adding that industrial workers will want to live closer to their employer. “You could actually do it with one-acre lots, and with one-acre lots it could be with no rezoning,” Sanders said. “How many houses do you propose to put in there?” Ash asked. “We don’t know,” Reaves said. “You don’t know what you are building?” Ash asked. Zoning administrator Ken Jones explained that the developer does not want to draw up plans for the development until it first gets the property rezoned. “We are here for rezoning today and don’t have a set of plans,” Reaves said. “We know it’s going to be houses only,” Jones said. Reaves said it would be single family residential with public water and sewer, curbs and gutters. “It seems like you should have plans,” Bonds said. Zoning board president Kent Falkner asked if there were any objections. The community response has been well organized from the start and different members of those residents living in the Farley Ridge subdivision took turns explaining the community’s position. Michael Whitson, a 27-year resident of Farley Ridge, owns six parcels totaling 34 acres across the road from the prospective development. He had a petition with 100 signatures opposing the rezoning and said 60 percent of the residents in Farley Ridge oppose the rezoning. His main points were that there must be a public need (for housing in this case) and the character of the neighborhood has changed. He said the need for housing in Marshall County already has been met. He cited 400 homes at Cayce Point 500 homes at Twin Lakes, subdivisions already approved. The city of Byhalia just approved a large subdivision south of I-22 and an apartment complex north of I-22. “These already approved developments will meet the housing need for North Marshall County for years,” Whitson said. Porter said about 150 houses have been sold in the price range of $230,000, with sewer and smaller lots. “You have to get $140,000 to $150,000 to make a profit on it,” he said. “We will put in curb and gutter, sewer and water. We know there is a need.” He said everyone cannot afford half-million dollar homes. Jones said the 94 acres, under the R3 zoning, can also be used for industrial development. Maureen Whitson said the 94 acres should be zoned for industrial. Michael Whitson said he has been in the area 25 years before Chickasaw Trail Industrial Park was developed and he argued that with the trail there has been a change in the character of the area. Porter interjected that he has half-milliondollar houses and lots “just sitting there.” This supported his assertion that more affordable housing is needed. Kayla Crisp argued that addition of 400 new homes on Barringer Road will amount to a traffic load on the road of one vehicle every eight and a half seconds. Susan Walker, who owns 13 acres on Landen Circle, addressed the current problem with floodwaters and silting on her property making about half her property on the back side unusable. She said silting is now taking place in Nonconnah Creek which makes it carry off less stormwater runoff and also silts the Coldwater River. She said the land is sandy and very erodible and soil is carried off in the water beginning all the way up to Wingo Road. “It’s asphalt and concrete and does not adsorb water. It just increases the velocity coming down,” she said. Tracey Talley, who lives across the road from one of Porter’s housing projects on Barringer Road, said she is “a direct victim of present construction.” “We would prefer it stay RE to protect from flooding of all this water,” she said. “We want to grow, but we want to grow healthy. “We have substantial housing development already approved. I think we’ve had too many.” She said there are a variety of prices and styles already available in the county. “Even the board of supervisors said `we’re approving these too fast,’ “ she said. Bonds said he recently walked down Barringer. And the stormwater drains on Barringer are already three-fourth full of silt. “We have to sustain our growth in a smart and slower way,” Talley said. “We’re saturated (in housing).” “It’s booming,” Bonds said. “It’s changing. You can’t stop people buying the land and doing something.” One last cry for help came from Daryl Rowley, who said when he bought his lot there was just a trickle of water. “I can’t make a move because of water,” Rowley said. “Farley Ridge is like a river. How can we build more houses when we can’t take care of what we have. I can’t believe this is going on. What about us? I’m stuck and it’s like nobody cares. I dug a pond to catch water and I still can’t build a house. Mud, trash, everything comes across my property.” Porter said he is totally in compliance. He said he put $3 million in the county sewer project in the area. “One-half acre lots make no sense whatever,” he said. “The math just doesn’t work.

Still no general manager has been hired to lead the Holly Springs Utility Department. Mayor Sharon Gipson held a motion to hire Ernest Campbell as general manager of the utility department and held one general laborer spot in the street department. Michael Gause was approved to work as general laborer in the Water Division of HSUD, with a vote of 3-1 with Ward 1 alderman Bernita Fountain opposing the motion. Supervisor Terry Sims, with the water division, requested the hiring of Jamari Stone to work in the water department as general laborer. “We are really shorthanded right now,” Sims said. “We really need him. We are short a crew and I gotta make the crew up.” Ward 3 alderman Colter Teel expressed concern about hiring anyone at the time because he said he is concerned about having the money to add more employees because of the budget. “I’m just worried, maybe too cautious,” Teel said. “I just don’t know.” Gipson said she would not have brought positions like Stone forward if she didn’t feel confident the money is there to pay the salaries. “Of course, we had a few storms and I am confident we have the money,” the mayor said. “I am asking along with the division supervisor that he be approved.” Stone was not at the meeting but had been present at two other meetings when his name was on the agenda. The board approved a motion to hire Tommy Tucker as a general laborer in Building and Grounds. It was Tucker’s third time on the agenda for the position. Fountain said she has concerns about hiring help because she is concerned, as is Teel, if there will be money to pay additional employee salaries. “We also have the winter coming up and are trying to maintain what we have,” she said. Fountain said she is worried about having more power outages during the winter and that preventative maintenance should be taking place. “I don’t want to have a situation of mass outages during harsher winter,” she said, making a motion to hire Tucker. Gipson said Tucker is an experienced electrician and plumber, and will also help keep the grass cut. Tucker said he has his own mowing business but it is winter here and grass cutting is at a standstill. Ward 2 alderman Andre Jones seconded the motion to hire Tucker and he was approved 3-1 with Teel voting against the motion. Aldermanat- Large Dexter Shipp was absent. Ivory L. Steward was recommended for the job of operator in the Right-Of-Way Division by Chester Lesueur, supervisor of right-of-way crews. “We are definitely short in the right-of-way department,” Lesueur said. “We have a lot of new service and a lot of times you have to cut the right-ofway first. It would definitely increase your revenue.” Teel made a motion to hire Steward at $16.60 an hour. He has experience with operating heavy equipment. Merriweather seconded the motion and it passed by unanimous vote of 4-0. The board also considered a motion to hire Robert L. Thomas in the utility department as supervisor of the right-of-way division. Merriweather made a motion to hire and Teel seconded, but Fountain and Jones opposed the motion. Gipson broke the tie putting Thomas in the position as supervisor. In other business, the board of aldermen: • authorized a request for cash #3 for $183,047 for payment on the fire station expansion. • approved a transfer of $79,822 to the general operating fund for a pay request for work on the fire station expansion. • approved transfer of $129,796 from payroll to the general operating fund. The money comes out of $500,0000 set aside from the American Rescue Plan ACT fund to help the city make payroll. At the Dec. 19, 2023, meeting the board approved transfer of $135,089 from the ARPA fund to the general fund to make the city payroll. The total so far from ARPA to make city payroll comes to $264,885 or just over half of the money approved for payroll from ARPA fund. • approved transfer of $1,942 to the general operating fund for nCourt settlement. • authorized payment of $1,559 to the Department of Finance and Administration for November Municipal Court Settlements. • approved travel for Tracy Reynolds and Terry Sims to attend the Mississippi National Gas Association training class in Tupelo for required credits.
