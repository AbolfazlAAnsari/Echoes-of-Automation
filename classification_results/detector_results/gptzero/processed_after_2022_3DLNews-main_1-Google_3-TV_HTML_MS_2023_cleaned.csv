This was around the time that President Biden granted these three sites a national park designation. Alan Spears, with the National Parks Conservation Association, took me to Graball Landing — where Emmett Till\'s body was pulled from the Tallahatchie River. I was struck by how peaceful and quiet the area was. I think about how something so calming and beautiful could also be a place where something horrific happened — that we’re still reconciling today. The history of Mississippi is so complicated, and I think it\'s important in my role as a community engagement reporter, that I visit communities that are still grappling with the past and searching for a way forward. Danny McArthur, environmental justice reporter, based in Tupelo Back in June, I was writing a story about aging Black farmers and how they’re passing on their knowledge to the next generation. I went to Louisville, Mississippi, and talked with Alonzo Miller, an older Black farmer who\'s kind of become a mentor for other aspiring farmers. We were just kind of going through his background and I asked him how he got to this point. Even after all these years, he remembers his band director, who showed him a way to get into college when he previously didn\'t see a path. “He said, ‘You can get a scholarship and go to school,’” Miller remembers. “He taught me how to play trombone.” It showed me how this idea of pouring into the next generation of farmers is very personal for him.

Kat Stromquist, senior reporter covering justice, incarceration and gun violence, based in New Orleans I\'d gone to a media briefing for NOLA Full Circle, this project trying to use a public health approach to fight gun violence in New Orleans. We\'d gathered under the I-10 Expressway as it begins to run along Claiborne Avenue. The highway has a controversial history for the way it affected Black neighborhoods in the city. When the briefing started, Ansel Augustine led a prayer. As he talked, we could hear the heavy ""chuck-chuck"" of cars going by on the highway overhead. I\'m new to radio, and this was one of the first events I brought my recording equipment out to. It stuck out in my mind because, as a print reporter, I might not have registered the background noise. But here it was so evident and provided a much clearer picture in my mind: people coming together on a rainy morning in an emotionally charged place. I\'m looking forward to more moments like that.
