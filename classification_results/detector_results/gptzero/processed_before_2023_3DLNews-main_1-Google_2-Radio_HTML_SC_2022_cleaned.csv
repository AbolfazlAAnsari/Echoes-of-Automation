Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the court that the city discriminated against the activist, Harold Shurtleff, because of his “religious viewpoint,” even though it had routinely approved applications for the use of one of the three flagpoles outside City Hall that fly the U.S., Massachusetts and Boston flags. Occasionally, the city takes down its own pennant and temporarily hoists another flag. Shurtleff and his Camp Constitution wanted to fly a white banner with a red cross on a blue background in the upper left corner, called the Christian flag. Breyer said the case hinged on whether the flag-flying is an act of the government, in which case Boston can do whatever it wants, or private parties like Shurtleff. Breyer wrote that “the city’s lack of meaningful involvement in the selection of flags or the crafting of their messages leads us to classify the flag raisings as private, not government, speech—though nothing prevents Boston from changing its policies going forward.” The city has said that in the event of a loss at the Supreme Court it probably will change its policy to take more control of what flags can fly. The case is Shurtleff v. Boston, 20-1800. Share this story: Get exclusive music and faith content and enter contests with our weekly email!

interesting life. Most ordinary young men in their twenties aren\'t responsible for 38 amazing children, but David is far from ordinary. Rather hear the story? Click here to listen. As a child David tragically lost both parents in a car accident. A caring uncle took over his care, but sadly lost his battle with cancer after a few short years, leaving David an orphan. As a very young teenager on the streets of hectic Kampala, Uganda, David had to collect plastic bottles on the street in order to have enough money to buy food. There were many nights that David went to bed hungry. Through the providence of God, David met a kind pastor in the middle of an outdoor service. The man of God became like a surrogate father to David and even offered to pay him to clean the church. David earned enough money to find a place to live--a rare feat for a 13-year-old. He never forgot life on the streets and would often try to feed the other orphan children who were alone and desperately trying to survive. Soon after that, a woman posted about David\'s story on Facebook. More money began to pour in--enough for David to start to feed not only himself, but the other children as well. David is now ""father"" to 38 children. He has taught them the Word of God, how to worship and sing praises to Him. He also takes care to feed each child flavorful, healthy food. All of them have a safe place to eat, grow, learn and be loved. David says they are ""one big, happy family."" You can connect with him here on Instagram. You can watch some of his amazing videos here on YouTube. Here\'s a link to David\'s non-profit Yahweh Children Ministries.
