Saturday. The Boeing Starliner spacecraft is likely to lift off from Cape Canaveral Saturday, sending two NASA astronauts to the Space Station. The launch of a ULA Atlas V rocket is scheduled for 12:25 Saturday. The weather forecast calls for 90% favorable conditions. The Starliner spacecraft has been plagued by problems: software issues, corroded valves, flammable tape inside the capsule, a helium leak, and parachute issues. But NASA and Boeing are confident that Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will have a safe journey to the space station and back. Assuming a successful flight, NASA will clear the Starliner for crew flights on a regular basis, starting next year. Meanwhile, SpaceX continues its cadence of regular Starlink satellite launches. The next Falcon 9 liftoff may come between 6:43 and 11:14PM this evening. Brevard pedestrians beware. Brevard County ranked among the country’s deadliest metro areas for pedestrians. That’s according to a study released Thursday by Smart Growth America. Brevard ranked No. 11 among the country\'s 100 largest metropolitan areas. That’s actually an improvement. The Space Coast has ranked as high as No. 2 for pedestrian danger. The most dangerous area in the country: Memphis, Tenn. Can Trump vote in Florida this November? Now that Donald Trump has been found guilty, some question whether he’ll be able to vote in November in Florida. State law says Florida residents (such as Trump) with felony convictions in other states are ineligible to vote in Florida. But there’s a caveat: that law applies only if the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted. Trump was found guilty in New York, and New York allows felons to vote as long as they are not actually behind bars. And it’s highly unlikely Trump will be in jail before November. Florida still says black people benefited from slavery. For yet another year, Florida public school students will continue to learn that Black Americans in some way benefited from slavery. On Wednesday, the Florida Board of Education approved the state\'s 2024 social studies standards. They include an African American history curriculum that has caused discomfort among the state\'s Black communities, who say some of the lessons are “inaccurate."" One of those inaccuracies, they say, is: “…slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.” For almost a year, Black communities across Florida, have petitioned the Florida Department of Education to remove the language, to no avail. How Florida ranks in student loan debt. Florida continues to rank high nationally for total federal student loan debt. Borrowers in Florida owe more than $100 billion. That’s the third-highest amount of federal student loan debt in the country. The average student loan burden in Florida is over $38,000 per borrower. The age group that owes the most is 35 to 49 years old. The state with the most student loan debt: California. Public pools help residents cool down. As the streak of hot weather continues, some Brevard residents jump into their backyard pool. But if you don’t have your own pool, there are six public swimming pools you can use in Brevard. Many offer open swim, lap swim, and swimming lessons. Check FloridaToday.com for locations.
