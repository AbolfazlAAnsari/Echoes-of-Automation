On Wednesday morning, the Marshall County Sheriff\'s Office got a 911 call about a shooting at the Hilldale Apartments on Hilldale Lane. There was one man injured; he had to be airlifted to Baptist Health Hospital in Paducah after he was shot in the wrist. Some neighbors who live in the apartments say the shooting happened right between the breezeway of two apartments. Detectives confirmed on Wednesday that a crew from WK&T, a local telecommunications company, was setting up something in one of these apartments. Detective Samantha Mighell with the Marshall County Sheriff\'s Department says they don’t have a description of a suspect just yet. “They’re not 100% certain. From what we heard, he heard the shot and then felt that he had been shot, and as far as anything else about the suspect, we’re still looking into that,” she said. Mighell added that the victim is okay; he sustained serious injuries, but they were not life-threatening. Detective Mighell also said that they do believe the area is safe, but they have increased patrols. ""It’s not like we have any concerns that there would be someone out there trying to hurt people just randomly; that’s not what our initial investigation is leaning toward,” she said. Mighell asked that if you have any additional information to call the Marshall County Sheriff\'s Department and say you have information about this case. Their number is (270) 527-3112.

Austin\'s unannounced hospitalization, which was not disclosed to the media or Biden and other senior administration officials for days, raised major questions about transparency and communications within the Biden administration.

Austin last took questions from the media more than one month ago on Dec. 20 when he visited the USS Gerald R. Ford, an aircraft carrier operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Two days later after returning to the United States, Austin underwent surgery to treat prostate cancer, a procedure which required general anesthesia and an overnight stay. His surgery and hospital stay, as well as his diagnosis with prostate cancer in early-December, was not revealed to the president and to senior administration officials until after the New Year when he was hospitalized a second time for complications from the surgery. Video above: Lloyd Austin says he\'s \'still recovering\' Austin remained in the hospital for two weeks, leaving on Jan. 15. He then worked from home until this past Monday, when he returned to the Pentagon for a bilateral meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. At the time, Austin said, ""I feel good and recovering well, but still recovering."" Biden acknowledged earlier this month that Austin’s failure to notify him about his hospitalization was a lapse in judgment. Austin’s chief of staff, Kelly Magsamen, directed a 30-day review of the Pentagon’s processes and procedures for notifying senior national security leaders and the White House when the Defense secretary needs to transfer authorities to the deputy secretary, which was required during Austin’s hospitalization. The Defense Department Inspector General launched a separate investigation of whether the Pentagon had the appropriate policies in places to ensure an effective transfer or power and duties.
