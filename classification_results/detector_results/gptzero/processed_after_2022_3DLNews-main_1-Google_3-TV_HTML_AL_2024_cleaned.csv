(WSFA) - The Alabama Public Library Service has officially voted to not renew its membership with the American Library Association. The ALA is a librarian professional development organization that has recently come under fire in Alabama. Opponents contend it promotes Marxism, discriminates against faith-based organizations, and supports keeping sexual content in libraries. Gov. Kay Ivey threatened to cut funding to the state’s public libraries in October, saying she wants to restrict funds for libraries that don’t adopt policies to require more parental supervision in libraries. After the governor’s letter, the APLS sought to vote in November to disaffiliate from the ALA but postponed that action until Tuesday to study how breaking away from the group will impact local libraries. The states public library service voted to end its membership with the ALA because some members say the discourse became a distraction. Local public libraries, however, have their own membership with the organization. Some supporters of the decision to cut ties believe local libraries will follow in the state’s steps to end their own membership, but Hannah Reese with Clean Up Alabama says ending a membership is not enough. She’s calling for a complete disaffiliation from the ALA. “Just not renewing the membership is not what we’ve asked for,” Reese explained. :It’s the APLS having to go through what they’ve determined to be policy and reflecting on the influence of the ALA and what parts don’t reflect Alabama values.” Matt Layne, who serves as president of the Alabama Library Association said he feels like there’s “a bit of a manufactured outrage that’s occurred in our state regarding the American Library Association.” Tuesday’s decision is not the end of the ALA debate. At Ivey’s request, Wednesday marks the beginning of the process to that could change the state’s public library service administrative code, which requires local libraries to publicly renew and vote on memberships with the ALA. That’s something many libraries already do. The public can submit comments on those administrative changes starting Wednesday. Not reading this story on the WSFA News App?

The Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office contacted bear experts at Florida Fish and Wildlife, who transported the cubs to a secure location while they investigated how they showed up in the area. Authorities found that the cubs escaped from a self-proclaimed bear trainer that kept them in an enclosure at a residence on Old River Road.
