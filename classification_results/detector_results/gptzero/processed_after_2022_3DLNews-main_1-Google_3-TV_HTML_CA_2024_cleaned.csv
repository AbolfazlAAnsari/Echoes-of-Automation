Four years ago, both groups helped Biden win the state by just 11,400 votes, making him the first Democratic candidate to carry Arizona in over 20 years. This year, these voters are expected to not only be influential in the race for the White House but also for control of Congress. In between, there are young, Native voters deciding how to use their electoral power. But strategists and politicians familiar with organizing Native voters agree: more needs to be done to court this significant voting bloc. ""Native voters are powerful, and we can\'t be ignored anymore. We\'ve shown that,"" said Jaynie Parrish, executive director of Arizona Native Vote. Parrish is part of the Navajo Nation. ""And we just need other people to meet us where we are and get on board."" The battleground state is home to 22 federally recognizedNative tribes and nations. The U.S. Census estimates that more than 300,000 people in Arizona identify as Native American. Each tribal government and community, whether it\'s rural or urban, has its own unique governance, history and challenges to participating in state and federal elections. ""We are fighting against structures that weren\'t built for us. ... They weren\'t meant for us there. They were trying to kill us all. We\'re not supposed to be here,"" Parrish said. ""We\'re not supposed to be voters."" Organizers say challenges remain with outreach from the Democratic and Republican parties. Outreach that goes beyond asking for a vote. Arizona GOP state Rep.

""That one Native American vote on that reservation, no matter what party, is just as important as my [own] vote."" Cook said that he has seen limited attempts to bridge that gap from his party in Arizona, something he sees as shortsighted when many conservative issues could overlap with issues in Native communities. ""Tribal members on reservations have a lot in common with those people that live off reservations in small rural communities,"" he said. ""They want good schools and education opportunities. They want good jobs, but really careers to raise families on. They want good roads and bridges and stuff for their kids. And they want to live in safe communities."" When asked who is responsible for conducting outreach to tribal members, the Republican National Committee told NPR it doesn\'t have a point person but isrolling out voting resources in Navajo. The Arizona GOP did not respond to NPR\'s requests about tribal outreach, but there are signs that statewide candidates acknowledge the need to mobilize the community. Kari Lake, a Republican running for Arizona Senate, has a Natives for Kari Lake group. Democrats have a head start. They formed outreach roles on the national level at the Democratic National Committee, down to the local Navajo County office. Loren Marshall, 38, is the director of campaigns and engagement for Northeast Arizona Native Democrats, a project of the Navajo County Democrats. Marshall, who wasn\'t registered to vote until 2020, works to get tribal members registered to vote and has put an emphasis on courting young voters. She said she\'s encountered pushback from younger voters over not wanting to be active in a system that damaged their communities. ""\'Why would we want to participate or get involved in something that just has not been something that we\'ve practiced or something that we\'ve done as Natives\',"" Marshall said, repeating comments she\'d heard. Still, she said she\'s confident turnout will be high for Democrats this year, partially due to their focus on community-based organizing. ""We\'re going to be able to get a lot of folks to come out, and the voter turnout is going to be pretty high,"" Marshall said. ""It\'s going to be a great election year in tribal communities."" Arizona ranks as the top third state where young voters are most likely to shape the presidential race, according to data from Tufts University, and the top state for young voter impact on the Senate election.

Sitting in a classroom at the Phoenix Indian Center in December, the six voters open up about where they are from. Their tribes, hometowns and reservations span across urban and rural areas and state and country borders. Ferreira: That there\'s nothing going on in our community.

Pereira: I think people, at least specifically with the Hia-Ced, what I\'ve heard is like people just call us Mexicans or like, \'oh, you guys aren\'t really Native.\' And you know, the border crossed us. We didn\'t cross the border. Holgate: I think so many times outsiders will come into our communities just assuming that, \'I need to be the voice for you or the savior for you,\' when in reality, we have so many educated people and people who are entrepreneurs and pioneers in different areas. Lopez: People will come onto our reservation to practice shooting their guns because they just think it\'s empty farmland or they don\'t know that it\'s an actual community living there. They just think it\'s like farmland in between the two cities. The six tribal members all agreed on one overarching theme: politicians on both sides of the aisle haven\'t taken the time to get to know their communities. They detailed problems with water access, poor infrastructure and fracturing business sectors. Problems they wish they could tell candidates vying for their votes. Pereira: When they get the opportunity for a photo op, they\'re just using students to come out and take a few pictures, and that\'s it. I would rarely get an opportunity to say what I\'m doing, and if I did speak, it would be 2.5 seconds and they\'re gone. They really don\'t care. But because you\'re Native and because you\'re you, they really just want you in the picture. Holgate: I\'ve also had leaders who have really changed my life because they come, they go to my grandmother\'s house and they see that she doesn\'t have running water. ... And I think there\'s so many politicians who stop at the parade and that\'s like the most exposure they\'ll ever have. Whether or not they were old enough to vote in 2020, all six referenced the last presidential election as a defining moment where they felt their voice was heard. Native Americans have only had the right to vote in federal elections for 100 years — a right several reflected was still fought for by their elders for decades after. To these six, the act of voting also honors that past. Henry: You hear it all the time: \'Vote. Your vote matters. Your vote matters.\' And for so long ours didn\'t. It felt like we had no influence, no power. So 2020 was where everything kind of turned around. And it showed a lot of people, and it showed a lot of us, the potential we have. So ever since then, I keep up with the voting. Ferreira: I heard a lot of the politicians saying that \'Hey, we need the Native vote.\' We didn\'t necessarily show up in 2016 as much as we should have. ... It didn\'t feel like it mattered until 2020. That was the first time it felt like it mattered because it was the first time that we decided the election. Holgate: Voting and politics in general, is more of a family thing for me. ... As an indigenous person ... we\'re fighting for land, and for water and for natural resources. And it just feels so lonely at times, especially being in an urban setting where most of your friends are non-Native, urban. They have no clue about what we\'re facing back home or what our families are facing. And that\'s always a struggle. I think it\'s a lonely journey, voting and stuff for me. Medina: Something that I have personal encounters with every time I clock in with my job is a huge drug issue. A lot of fentanyl [has] leaked into my community where there\'s countless overdoses to the point where I\'m afraid of running out of Narcan and doing CPR on these subjects. Holgate: Education\'s so huge for us in Native and indigenous populations. But I think something that I\'m starting to look at now is, how do I empower students from tribal nations in high school to graduate? Pereira: We are'}]"

(KSEE/KGPE) – A shelter-in-place was imposed and later lifted at Clovis High School on Tuesday following what school district officials say was a phone call alleging suspicious activity in the area. According to the Clovis Unified School District, students continued instruction while law enforcement worked to check the perimeter of the campus. The action was prompted by a phone call – but officials did not elaborate on what was said during the phone call. District officials say a shelter-in-place is not a lockdown. The shelter-in-place protocol requires students to stay indoors and doors are locked – with all other instructional activities continuing as normal. The incident comes five days after a similar incident at a Clovis Unified campus, impacting Clovis East High School, Reyburn Intermediate and Reagan Elementary. That incident was also prompted by a phone call threat. Law enforcement has since confirmed that Clovis High School is safe and normal operations have resumed on campus.

The Dow fell 317 points, or 0.8%, posting its worst day since December. The S&P 500 slid 1.6% on Wednesday in its worst day since September. The Nasdaq Composite lost 2.2%, its worst session since October. Wednesday\'s declines came after Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his post-meeting conference discouraged investor hopes for a rate cut as soon as March, sending equities tumbling. ""I think the market has been getting ahead of itself, with pricing in many more rate cuts, because it will be associated with a much weaker economy if they were to cut as many times as the market is currently pricing,"" Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok told CNBC\'s ""Squawk on the Street"" Thursday. Bond yields slumped further, with the 10-year Treasury reaching a one-month low. The benchmark was last 9 basis points lower at 3.87%.

Investors haven\'t been this bullish in six weeks, since the week before Christmas. Bearish opinion on the outlook for stock prices over the coming six months only dipped to 24.5% from 26.1% last week (still well below the historical average of 31.0%, also for a 13th week). Neutral sentiment — that stocks will be little changed in the next six months — narrowed to 26.4% from 34.6%.

Shares of the industrial stock fell 3% after the company missed expectations for revenue in the fourth quarter. That made it the worst performer in the Dow and only member stock down more than 1%.

Walgreens and Amgen were the next biggest gainers, rising more than 2% each. — Alex Harring Updated projections from the Atlanta branch of the Federal Reserve shows that the U.S. economy is gaining strength. The Atlanta Fed\'s GDPNow estimate jumped 4.2% growth for the first quarter in its weekly update. The same projection called for 3.0% growth last week. According to the release, the increase was driven by improved projections for both personal consumption and private investment.

The 50-year-old’s death in October was ruled an accident brought on by positional asphyxia due to “acute alcohol intoxication.” It was initially identified as an apparent “cardiac event” by “General Hospital” co-star Maurice Bernard, who confirmed Christopher’s death in a post on Instagram. Coronary artery atherosclerosis, which is a thickening of arteries from build-ups of fat or cholesterol, was also named by the medical examiner as a contributing factor in his death. The soap star, who was open about his experience struggling with bipolar depression and substance abuse, was found dead in his downtown San Diego apartment on Oct. 31 by a friend. The friend called 9-1-1 after Christopher was found unresponsive in his bedroom, although the medical examiner said paramedics confirmed his death “without medical intervention due to postmortem changes.” It remains unclear how long Christopher was unresponsive in his apartment before he was found. After his death was announced, multiple colleagues took to social media to remember Christopher and his time-honored work in daytime television. “Tyler was a truly talented individual that lit up the screen in every scene he performed and relished bringing joy to his loyal fans through his acting,” Bernard wrote of his late colleague in his Instagram post. “Tyler was a sweet soul and wonderful friend to all of those who knew him.” Christopher was best known for his portrayal of Nikolas Cassadine on the iconic medical soap opera, “General Hospital.” After a two-decade tenure on the show, he took on the role of Stefan DiMera for “Days of Our Lives” between 2018 and 2019. He earned Daytime Emmys for both of the roles, as well as multiple nominations. Along with the two daytime soaps, Christopher also worked on the ABC Family drama series “The Lying Game” and guested on such series as “The Twilight Zone,” “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” “Family Law,” “Charmed,” “Angel” and “The Pretender.” His film credits include “Shouting Secrets,” “Out of the Black,” and “Max Winslow and the House of Secrets.” In 2008, Christopher married former ESPN reporter Brienne Pedigo, although the couple later divorced in 2021. They share two children: Greysun James Christopher and Boheme Christopher. He was also briefly married to “Desperate Housewives” alum Eva Longoria from 2002 to 2004.

scores, feds say Commercial driver\'s license applicants promised passing scores, feds say The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. Commercial driver\'s license applicants promised passing scores, feds say Four current and former Massachusetts State Police troopers and two civilians are facing federal charges in connection with a bribery conspiracy that gave guaranteed passing scores on commercial driver\'s licenses to applicants. Acting U.S. Attorney Joshua Levy said that Sgt. Gary Cederquist, 58, of Stoughton, Trooper Joel Rogers, 54, of Bridgewater, and civilians Scott Camara, 42, of Rehoboth, and Eric Mathison, 47, of Boston, were arrested this week. Retired State Troopers Calvin Butner, 63, of Halifax and Perry Mendes, 63, of Wareham were also arrested in Florida. “The grand jury indictment against these six men includes charges of extortion, honest services mail fraud, conspiracy, false statements and falsification of records. In short, as alleged in this indictment, the CDLs were for sale and troopers were bribed with free goods to pass applicants no matter how they performed on the tests,” Levy said. Cederquist allegedly received personal benefits for passing unqualified applicants, including a new driveway valued at over $10,000 and a $2,000 snow blower. To secure a CDL, an operator must pass three tests — a vehicle inspection, a basic skills test and a road test — to operate large vehicles such as oil tankers and school buses. “Under federal law, these CDL tests are administered at the state level, and here in Massachusetts, that responsibility is vested with the state police in a particular unit known as the Commercial Drivers Licensing Unit,” Levy said. Cederquist, Rogers, Mathison and Camara were arraigned in Boston federal court Tuesday afternoon and were released with conditions. State Police said Cederquist has been suspended. Butner and Mendes were in Boston federal court on Wednesday. The 74-count indictment alleges that starting in August 2018, Cederquist, Butner and Mendes, who were part of the unit, used their positions to falsify results on the basic skills test for certain applicants, Levy said. Rogers allegedly joined the conspiracy in 2022. The civilians — Mathison and Camara, a Fall River firefighter — either provided free goods or conspired with the troopers to pass applicants who did not actually pass the test. Several text messages between the defendants are highlighted in the indictment. “They jokingly talked about golden treatments and golden handshakes, referring to giving guaranteed passes to certain CDL applicants regardless of how they did on the tests,” Levy said. In one text message, Butner talks about an applicant who is performing required maneuvers and he described him as “a mess” and said the applicant owes Cederquist ""prime rib"" for passing the test. In another message, Cederquist allegedly texted Mathison, ""This kid is an idiot” and “No idea what he is doing.” Levy said all CDL recipients identified as not qualified in the course of the investigation have been reported to the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. “The Massachusetts State Police demand and expect all members to conduct themselves with integrity, honesty and in accordance with all federal and state laws and Department policies, rules and regulations. The Department condemns the actions of the four current and former CDL Unit members as alleged in the federal indictment and our internal affairs investigation. The alleged misconduct of those defendants is the antithesis of and in stark contrast to the values, character, and integrity exhibited by the overwhelming majority of our Troopers every day in service to the public,"" said Massachusetts State Police Department Interim Superintendent Colonel John Mawn Jr. ""I appreciate the investigation by the Attorney General\'s Office and the work of the Mass State Police getting to the bottom of this. It’s a matter that was investigated initially during my time as the AG, so I\'m familiar with this investigation and I\'m pleased to see the indictments today,"" said Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey. ""There needs to be accountability and transparency in everything that’s done and that’s an important indictment."" State police say they have already implemented reforms to the CDL unit so that there\'s more accountability and an internal investigation is underway. The U.S. Attorney said they have identified more than two dozen drivers who may be on the road with fraudulent CDL licenses, and they\'ve referred those names to the RMV. Applicants in Massachusetts may apply for a CDL beginning at age 18. However, Federal Regulations state that a license holder, including CDL holders, must be 21 years of age to drive a commercial motor vehicle in interstate commerce.

At conservative America’s favorite news source, the Republican nomination process is essentially over and has been for awhile, leaving DeSantis and Haley annoyed at perceived favoritism to Trump. Hardly grateful, the former president regularly tears into Fox for what he sees as disloyalty, even ripping his former White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, now a Fox contributor. The discontent illustrates the ongoing importance of Fox News as an agenda-setter that frequently drives, and not simply reflects, Republican politics. No one can get to the top of the GOP’s hill without it. It’s also a testament to Fox’s power and influence, said Brian Stelter, media critic and author of two books about Fox News. In a “Fox & Friends” appearance, Haley suggested her questioners seemed eager to “coronate” Trump. Shortly before DeSantis ended his own campaign, he said that conservative media outlets like Fox are afraid to challenge the ex-president for fear of losing their audience. The past few months were a hard fall for DeSantis, once the beneficiary of so much attention that the Florida governor signed bills for the network’s cameras. He’s made 47 appearances on Fox since last September. Haley had 45 appearances in that time, and Trump six. “I think they were ready to move on from Trump, but the base of the party was not,” said Erick Erickson, whose conservative talk show airs on 45 stations across the country. “At the end of the day, these are their viewers and they don’t want to alienate them.” The DeSantis campaign was upset about Fox’s town hall with Trump before the Iowa caucuses, when anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum received criticism for treating their subject gently. Trump had demanded — and received — a 9 p.m. Eastern time slot on Fox for a Jan. 10 town hall to blunt the impact of DeSantis and Haley, appearing in their only one-on-one debate the same time on CNN. Fox held separate pre-Iowa town halls for DeSantis and Haley, but at 6 p.m. before prime time. The DeSantis team felt Trump received little pushback from Fox when he decided to skip debates. They were angry that surrogates for the former president showed up at post-debate “spin rooms” even with the candidate absent, said a person close to the campaign who spoke candidly on condition of anonymity. Frustration boiled over when DeSantis’ campaign manager, James Uthmeier, felt that a Fox graphic didn’t show the extent of the candidate’s appearances in Iowa. “Fox has turned into full-blown Trump TV,” Uthmeier wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Fox did not make an executive available for an interview for this story. But a representative said that Trump surrogates were on scene post-debate because they had been booked for appearances by other networks. The 6 p.m. town halls weren’t as much a disadvantage as it seemed, since they followed “The Five,” Fox’s most-watched show. On Jan. 16, the day after the Iowa caucus, Fox’s Laura Ingraham urged both DeSantis and Haley to clear the field for Trump. “If she drops out today, if she came to terms with the fact that the GOP is a populist party, if she started vigorously campaigning for Trump, she could perhaps rebuild some of the trust that she’s lost with the GOP base,” Ingraham said. During her testy “Fox & Friends” appearance on the morning of the New Hampshire primary, Haley rebuffed host Brian Kilmeade when he asked what would constitute a strong showing for her that day. Asked by Ainsley Earhardt if she would withdraw if she lost New Hampshire, Haley said she would not. Kilmeade later repeated the same question. “I don’t care how much y’all want to coronate Donald Trump,” Haley said. “At the end of the day, that’s not what America wants. America wants a choice.” Kilmeade told her, “I really wonder why you think we’re the enemy.” One possibility: she had watched Trump give Kilmeade a tour of his plane earlier in New Hampshire. “You look like you’re in fightin’ shape,” Kilmeade said as he greeted the former president. “How much weight did you lose?” “I get their annoyance,” Erickson said. “They’ve got a right to be annoyed by it, (with Fox) essentially pushing them to bow to a reality that they were not prepared to acknowledge.” A Fox spokeswoman noted that, in response to Kilmeade’s “enemy” comment, Haley said “because I’ve looked at the media,” implying a broader criticism. She and DeSantis aren’t staying away, though; both accepted invitations to appear on Fox after making their criticisms. During an interview with New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Haley surrogate, Fox’s Harris Faulkner pushed back when Sununu questioned whether Trump’s age had affected his cognitive abilities — a frequent Fox topic when President Joe Biden is the subject. “The guy is nearly 80 years old,” Sununu said. “He’s 77,” Faulkner replied. “Yes, that’s nearly 80,” Sununu said. “We’ll do the math later.” Faulkner admonished Sununu for calling Trump a coward for not debating. “No name calling,” she said. “We don’t do name calling.” This is the first presidential campaign since the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit against the network for spreading lies in its post-2020 election coverage, which Fox settled for $787 million last year. Reams of internal documents released as part of that case showed how Fox executives and personalities greatly feared losing Trump fans in their audience by telling them things they didn’t want to hear. The same management is in place now. Last week, a half hour after a New York jury ordered Trump to pay writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her, Fox’s “The Five” didn’t mention the news. The same hour, MSNBC talked of nothing else. The New York Times put the verdict on its front page Saturday, although not as the lead story. Meanwhile, Trump has maintained a steady stream of invective about Fox on his Truth Social website. His attack on his former press secretary came after she noted on Fox that Biden had a fairly good night in New Hampshire and that Trump should turn his attention to the general election. “I don’t need any advice from RINO Kayleigh McEnany on Fox,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, referencing the conservative slur Republican in Name Only. “Just had a GIANT victory … and she’s telling me what I could do better.” Trump frequently targets “Fox & Friends” host Steve Doocy for the host’s occasional fact checks. “Whatever happened to this guy???” Trump wrote. “Hard to believe how one-sided Fox is,” Trump wrote in one post. “What a difference from past … No wonder the Republican base no longer cares about them.” Fox had no comment on Trump’s posts. “The key for Fox is, are they going to silence the voices that have raised some concerns and skepticism, which they haven’t done so far, and credit to them for doing that,” Erickson said. “Trump is trying to bully and cajole and get people to fall in line so they don’t utter anything critical.” ___ David Bauder covers media for The Associated Press.

la noche, los republicanos de Iowa se dirigirán a escuelas y centros comunitarios para participar en sus primeros caucuses en el país, el paso inicial en el proceso de nominación presidencial de meses del Partido Republicano. Los eventos se llevarán a cabo en 1,657 distritos electorales en los 99 condados del estado. Noticias de California 24/7 en Telemundo 52. Mira aquí. Aquí hay un resumen rápido de cómo funcionan los caucus y cómo los habitantes de Iowa votarán por sus candidatos presidenciales republicanos preferidos. El lunes 15 de enero, a partir de las 8 p.m. ET, que son las 7 p.m. en Iowa. Los votantes elegibles deben tener al menos 18 años antes del 5 de noviembre de 2024, que es el día de las elecciones generales. Para participar en esta contienda republicana, los asistentes al caucus deben estar registrados en el Partido Republicano, pero no es necesario que hayan sido republicanos desde siempre. Los independientes o demócratas que quieran participar pueden volver a registrarse para hacerlo, y las encuestas sugieren que varios habitantes de Iowa están aprovechando esa opción en ausencia de caucus demócratas competitivos. El registro de votantes el mismo día está disponible para aquellos que no se registraron como republicanos de antemano o para aquellos que nunca antes se reunieron ni votaron. Es importante recordar que los demócratas y los republicanos llevan a cabo sus asambleas electorales de dos maneras muy diferentes. Los republicanos seleccionan a su candidato mediante una simple votación secreta, a diferencia del demócrata que baraja de un extremo a otro del lugar del caucus. Los asistentes al caucus llegarán antes de las 7 p.m. Tomografía computarizada y registro. Después de eso, se encargarán de algunas medidas procesales, como elegir presidentes y secretarios de distrito. Luego, los nuevos presidentes invitarán a los partidarios de los candidatos presidenciales a dirigirse a la sala. Después de esos discursos, los asistentes al caucus recibirán sus boletas y emitirán sus votos por sus candidatos preferidos. Los votos se recogen, se tabulan y luego, normalmente, se anuncian en la sala. El Partido Republicano de Iowa tiene un proceso para que los distritos electorales carguen sus resultados no oficiales en una aplicación web. Luego, esos resultados pasan por un proceso de verificación y se publicarán en línea a través de un enlace en el sitio web del partido estatal, que se publicará el día de las asambleas. Hay 40 delegados republicanos en juego en la contienda (de un total de 2.429 que se otorgarán): 25 delegados generales, 12 delegados de distrito del Congreso y tres miembros del RNC. Los candidatos reciben el número de delegados igual a su participación en el voto estatal. Por ejemplo, el 28% de Ted Cruz en las asambleas electorales del Partido Republicano de Iowa de 2016 se tradujo en ocho delegados, en comparación con los siete del 24% de Donald Trump y el 23% de Marco Rubio, mientras que los otros candidatos se dividieron el resto.

Short-term exposure to the chemical can cause dizziness, drowsiness and headaches. Long-term exposure can result in liver damage and cancer concerns, the EPA said. An interim report by the National Transportation Safety Board indicated that a hotbox detector found the temperature of one of the train\'s wheel bearings was 253 degrees above the ambient temperature. Anything above 200 degrees is considered critical. Trending stories at Scrippsnews.com'}]"
