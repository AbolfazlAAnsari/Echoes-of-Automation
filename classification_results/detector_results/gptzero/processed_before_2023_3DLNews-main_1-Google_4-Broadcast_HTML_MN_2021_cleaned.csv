El aumento de migrantes irregulares a través de la selva del Darién que buscan llegar a EE.

Es por tal razón que, en apoyo al Gobierno de Panamá, el organismo internacional ha instalado dos estaciones de registro de migrantes en el país centroamericano para brindar asistencia humanitaria a los miles de personas en tránsito. Solo entre enero y septiembre de este año la institución reportó que más de 91.300 migrantes, en su mayoría haitianos, han atravesado desde Colombia el Tapón del Darién hacia Panamá buscando llegar a Estados Unidos, Canadá o México. La cifra, ha triplicado el récord anterior de 30.000 personas en la misma ruta durante todo 2016.

La institución asegura que de la cifra total, cerca de 13.000 provenían de Cuba y unos 15.00, de Venezuela; el resto de países de Asia y África. Un dato que preocupa a la institución es el aumento de la migración infantil, el que ha quedado en evidencia ante el alarmante número de menores que llegan a Panamá por la ruta del Darién. Mientras que en 2017 los niños representaban el 2% del movimiento migratorio por la frontera entre Colombia y Panamá, entre enero y septiembre de este año ya representan el 20%. El jefe de misión de la OIM dijo que «la respuesta a las necesidades de los migrantes que transitan irregularmente por Panamá plantea importantes retos relacionados principalmente con la financiación». E hizo un llamado a los países a redoblar la coordinación con otros gobiernos y a la cooperación internacional para “responder a las necesidades humanitarias de la población en tránsito». Desde la perspectiva de Paz la situación que enfrentan los migrantes irregulares en tránsito en la región “debe ser abordada desde un enfoque regional y no puede ser responsabilidad de un solo país”.'}]"

JOSEPH, Minn. (KTTC) – It was a typical night in St. Joseph, Minn. October 22, 1989. 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling, his young brother and another friend, took their bicycles down the street from the Wetterling home to rent a movie from a corner store. Jacob didn’t return home that night. “They did everything right. There was no way he should have been abducted,” Former Mayo Clinic pediatrician and co-founder of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children Dr. Daniel Broughton said. When the boys were on their route back to the Wetterling home, a man came out of the bushes with a gun. He took Jacob, and instructed the others to run. Dr. Broughton co-founded the center in 1984, just a few years before Jacob was taken. He met Jacob’s mother, Patty Wetterling, at conference at Rochester’s Kahler Hotel a few years later. They’ve been friends ever since. “The story was really, really frightening,” Broughton said. “And potent and rare.” The St. Joseph community was on edge after Jacob went missing. “The school bike racks, normally full, were almost empty today. Because so many parents opted to escort their children to school,” an NBC reporter said during a newscast in 1989. The search for Jacob was on -- and would be, for the next 27 years. “Jacob Wetterling is part of all of our children’s history in Minnesota,” former WCCO-TV reporter Caroline Lowe said. Lowe spent 34 years with WCCO, reporting on Jacob’s case from the beginning. She recalls sitting in the Wetterling living room, talking with Patty, mother to mother. “Just knowing that Patty and Jerry, and the siblings kept that same house all those years,” she said. “Patty and Jerry wouldn’t move just in case Jacob would call someday, or show up. Just trying to imagine what they were going through, just trying to think about it, now, was just horrible.” In the decades searching for answers of Jacob’s whereabouts, hope kept alive. Flyers, billboards, even music pushed the search forward. “He’ll be home soon,” Patty said in 1989, hugging community members after a memorial for her son. “He had to feel it, you guys. He’s coming home soon.” “People were still concerned until the day he was found,” Broughton said, adding that support like that, is what sets Minnesotans apart. Jacob was found Sept. 2016. “It’s always been ‘where’s Jacob?’ And suddenly, Jacob’s been found,” Lowe said. “It’s something really hard to wrap your mind around.” Lowe recalls hopping on the first flight after learning the news. She sat front row in the court room, listening to the man who killed Jacob, all those years ago, give the gruesome details. 53-year-old Danny Heinrich was the man that took the 11-year-old, molesting him before fatally shooting him. Heinrick led law enforcement to Jacob’s burial site; farmland across the highway in Paynesville, a town just a few miles away from St. Joseph. “That was a hard time on everybody,” Broughton recalls. “I won’t go into the law enforcement issues but there were some. Maybe it couldn’t have been solved. Maybe it should’ve been. It’s always hard to know.” In 2021, years after Jacob was found, Patty Wetterling remains a board member for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. “She became such a spokesperson, not just for missing children, but for child advocacy and exploited children,” Broughton said. “It ended a chapter, but they were so involved at that time and just kept going.” While Jacob’s story is heartbreaking, the legacy he leaves behind, fuels exactly what fueled those looking for him those 27 years: hope. “Jacob he’s taught us all how to live, how to love, how to fair, how to be kind,” Patty said, shortly after Jacob was found. “He speaks to the world that he knew, that we all believe in. That it is a worth fighting for. His legacy will go on.” A lot has changed since 1989, and Jacob’s story plays a part. When Dr. Broughton helped start the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, about 66 percent of the cases were resolved. In present day, that number has jumped to 95 percent. Dr. Broughton has observed several societal changes in how children are raised present day. The first relates to stranger danger. Broughton says most of the time when a child is taken or abused, it’s from someone they know. While it’s good for children to remain aware of some strangers, a stranger, like a police officer, may be able to help them out of a dangerous situation. The second is the idea of “tattling.” Now, children are encouraged to disclose. “It’s really important that kids come forward,” Broughton said. Lastly, Broughton discussed the importance of computer safety. “Computer safely is really important and every school should teach that,” he said. “And it should be age appropriate, because it goes all the way through high school.” While the internet can be a scary place, especially for vulnerable kids, it can also be a powerful one. That’s why Broughton believes kids need to be trained on how to better navigate and use it safely. “The internet and technology is why the 95, 96 percent are being found today,” Broughton said.

SUPERIOR, Wis. – As warmer days start popping up in the forecast, many Northlanders are thinking spring and preparing for summer adventures. One family who recently moved to the area is now settling in as they prepare for their first year in business at The Backyard on Amnicon Lake. “This last year has been a different year for us, and we just decided to jump in,” said Amanda Nordby, owner of The Backyard on Amnicon Lake. The COVID-19 pandemic is prompting many business owners to take a pause and rethink their future moving forward, but for Chase and Amanda Nordby, their dreams are coming true. “It’s very exciting; it’s one thing we’ve dreamed about for 8-10 years,” said Chase Nordby, owner of The Backyard on Amnicon Lake. “I don’t feel like I’m working every day! I get to come in and talk to everybody in the community and provide a service that people want,” said Amanda. They’ve always had a passion to one day own a place encompassing entertainment and relaxation. “We’ve kind of been a team with this whole thing,” said Chase. “We have three kids and it’s something we want to bring, excitement, and have a place that people can come and relax at.” Their ownership became official on New Year’s Eve. “It’s the perfect place to go and relax and have a beer, have a drink,” said Amanda. Now just over two months in, the family is anxious as they anticipate what summer will bring. “We’ve been told that it’s supposed to get busy, and we’re excited about it,” said Amanda. The Backyard is bursting with opportunity for success. The business not only offers food, drinks, and entertainment but a campground that comes with beautiful views of Amnicon Lake. “He gets to do the outside work while I’m in here cooking pizzas, subs, and wraps,” said Amanda. While Chase tends to chores outside, Amanda puts her years of restaurant experience to work inside serving ice-cold beverages, and handcrafted bites to eat. “The pizza business is still the same as it was before us coming in which is great,” said Chase. Amanda even took time to learn from the previous owners, keeping consistency and customer satisfaction for the pizzas so many have come to love over the years. “The community has been fantastic. I couldn’t have asked for a better place to move and start a business,” said Amanda. The Nordby’s might be the most excited Northlanders waiting for the snow to melt, and summer to set in. But for now, they’re taking their time to get acquainted with customers and prepare for a successful first year as their dream becomes a reality. “We hope that it’s a family-oriented place for people to go relax and escape life,” said Amanda. The Backyard is open Tuesday through Sunday. Click here for more information.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 7:10 am News Director - Alexandria Local legislators Mary Franson (R-Dist 8B) and Paul Anderson (R-Dist 12B). SAINT PAUL, MN – Ahead of an expected announcement this week by Governor Walz loosening Minnesota's COVID restrictions, Rep. Mary Franson, R-Alexandria, is calling for a transparent and concrete end of the peacetime emergency. Just this week, Florida lifted all remaining COVID restrictions, and Governors of Democrat states like New York and California have established target dates for the lifting of capacity limits and other COVID restrictions. Other deep-blue states like Connecticut lifted capacity limits starting as far back as March. “The period of emergency is over,” said Franson. “The Governor’s emergency powers should not be used as a bargaining chip in budget negotiations. In fact, no budget deals should be struck until the emergency powers end and there’s a complete ban on vaccine passports/certification. As session draws to a close, the Senate should hold all budget bills, vote to end the emergency powers and ban vaccine passports/certification. If the House rejects ending the emergency powers and the passport bill, then the Senate should send a lights on bill and sine die. It is time for Governor Walz to join other governors, lift COVID restrictions, and end the emergency powers. “We continue heading in the right direction, with vaccines doing well and infection rates remaining low,” Rep. Paul Anderson said. “The governor even has indicated the State Fair will be pretty much back to normal this summer, so I encourage him to work with legislators on setting out a timeline based on data to fully reopen our state and get us back on track. The public deserves clear communication regarding our steps forward and information on how the governor plans to peel back his emergency powers that have been in place for around 14 months, especially since our state no longer faces an actual emergency.” House Republicans have voted nearly 20 times to end the peacetime emergency and have put forward numerous proposals to end or modify the governor’s Chapter 12 powers, as well as proposals to establish timelines and metrics that would end the peacetime emergency. Walz is expected to announce a significant loosening of COVID restrictions Thursday. The governor will likely keep a statewide mask mandate in place when he dials back COVID restrictions. It would be difficult for Walz to do that if he relinquished his emergency powers. (Alexandria, MN) 2021 had so much complexity to it.
