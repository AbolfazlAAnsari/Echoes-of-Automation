Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:11 pm Black vulture pauses in the bare branches of an oak tree. Congress is mulling a pair of bills aimed at helping livestock producers protect their calves, kids and lambs from predatory vultures. The bills, one in the U.S. House and the other in the Senate, target Coragyps atratus, the black vulture, a bird protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. The law enacts treaties between the United States and Canada, in 1916; Mexico in 1936, Japan in 1972, and Russia in 1976. The law prohibits the “take” – killing, capturing, selling, trading, and transport – of protected migratory bird species without prior authorization by the Department of Interior U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Black vultures are the subject of two bills filed in Congress. Vultures are known to be carrion-eaters, cleaning up roadkill or other carcasses. However, black vultures also hunt. Among its targets are newborn cattle, goats and sheep. The species is found in North and South America and is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as a species of “least concern.” While estimates suggest that black vultures are responsible for the loss of thousands of calves every year, as a protected species, the bird may not be killed without a permit. Because of the complexities of the treaties, obtaining a permit is not a simple process and permits are limited. Arkansas producers, permits are available through an agreement with the Arkansas Farm Bureau. What once required a minimum of two or three weeks has been reduced to a couple of days. The aim of the bills, HR1437 and S3358, both named the Black Vulture Relief Act of 2023, is to allow livestock producers to “take” black vultures without a permit so long as the take is necessary to protect livestock, said Brigit Rollins, staff attorney for the National Agricultural Law Center. In November, Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma introduced the Black Vulture Relief Act which would allow livestock producers to take black vultures without a permit so long as the take is necessary to protect livestock. A similar bill was introduced in the House last March by Rep. John Rose of Tennessee. “It’s an issue that’s been gaining prominence over the last few years, so the fact that a bill has been introduced in Congress specifically addressing it speaks to how quickly this issue has risen in importance,” Rollins said. Dana Martin Stewart of Martin Cattle Company in Judsonia has lost calves to vultures through the years. “It is extremely frustrating to see our calves hunted by vultures and to have very little recourse,” she said. “We spend a lot of extra time during calving season checking pastures, making sure they are up and able to nurse before the vultures get to them first. “Losing a calf because of vultures is not only an economic loss, but also a loss of genetics that have been years in the making,” Stewart said. In the fall of 2023, representatives from the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and the United States Cattlemen’s Association testified to Congress about the costs of vulture predation. “They were reporting that the number of producers affected by black vultures could range anywhere from 15 percent per state to as high as 33 percent of producers in heavily impacted areas such as Florida,” said Maggie Justice, extension beef production specialist for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services reported “that black vulture attacks on cattle increased by almost 25 percent between 2020 to 2022, based on the cases in which they were called to assist,” Justice said. “Oftentimes the vultures are going after calves as they are being born and the loss of a newborn calf can cost a producer on average, $2,000 or higher,” Justice said. “And that number only increases if the dam is harmed at this time as well.” Quantifying attacks is difficult. Cows often calve out of sight of humans and humans often don’t catch the birds in the act of killing livestock. “Some livestock producers might assume the loss was to a coyote. Other times it could be a stillborn calf,” said Becky McPeake, extension wildlife specialist for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture. “By the time the producer arrives, they might see the vultures cleaning up the carcass, not knowing whether the birds caused the death or not.” There are two vulture species in Arkansas. Turkey vultures are characterized by their red heads, and black vultures, with black heads. Both are year-round residents. “Turkey vultures typically are solitary and seek carcasses by smell and sight. As a single bird, they are not known to take live animals and are relatively unaggressive,” McPeake said. “Black vultures are aggressive, as they work in groups and attack vulnerable animals. Black vultures are also known to follow a turkey vulture and rob them of their carcass.” McPeake said that “some attribute climate change to their spread from their southern range into the U.S. As they have spread northward, more producers have been impacted.” USDA, in its publication “Vultures,” also suggests that a ban on the pesticide DDT in 1972 may have also helped vulture populations. “Also, vultures have benefited from fragmentation of the landscape by humans, which creates mosaics of forested and open areas for roosting, nesting and foraging,” the USDA publication states. “Vultures have clearly adapted and thrived in the presence of human activity.” Justice said if a producer does not have a permit, there are some ways to help protect their herd: Making sure that cattle calve in areas near human activity. “This will not only help in case of emergencies during calving but can also help to keep an eye out for vultures taking an interest in your group.” Scare off black vultures with loud noises so they won’t return to your pasture. Find and change whatever is attracting the vultures to a pasture before they become established. Consider adding guard animals to the herd such as guardian dogs or donkeys. “The biggest piece of advice would be that as soon as you see a black vulture near your property reach out to your Wildlife Service and your county extension agent for assistance looking into the correct depredation permits, as well as reimbursement for animal losses through the Livestock Indemnity Program,” Justice said.

Around 300 people protesting Israel’s war against Palestine blocked the Interstate 40 Hernando de Soto bridge from around 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. This came as the only other bridge across the river –a bridge that carries Interstate 55 — was closed for repair work. Both bridges are now open. The protest was organized by Memphis Voices for Palestine and Palestinian Memphians who have relatives in both Gaza and the West Bank, according to a report from the Memphis Commercial-Appeal. Jana Abuirshaid, the spokesperson for Memphis Voices for Palestine, told the newspaper that the protesters assembled Saturday to demand a ceasefire in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. She said she felt a sense of guilt and obligation to speak on behalf of Palestinians who were in Gaza and the West Bank, while her own family had come to the U.S., according to the Commercial-Appeal’s report. At first, protesters left the westbound lanes open, but at around 3:45 p.m., when the Memphis Police Department arrived, both lanes became blocked. Cars and semi-trucks backed up for miles. By 4:30 p.m., most of the protesters left the bridge, and by 5 p.m., the incident was over.

Worthen is a 20-year veteran of the journalism industry and has covered just about every topic there is. He has a passion for writing and telling stories.

Additionally, Worthen has been a prolific freelance journalist for two decades, and has been published in several travel magazines and on travel websites.

The Hermitage City Council met August 19, 2021 for the monthly meeting of the City Council. Present were council members Mary Moore, Jane Durden, and Chris Ledbetter. Mayor Tonya Kendrix presided. Also present were City Treasurer Angela Dawson, Police Chief Ben Poole, City Recorder Karla Ramos and City Attorney James Hamilton. Minutes and financial reports were approved. The Council approved the 2020 Water/Sewer Audit, opened a new account for ARPA funds, opened an account for a Community Facilities grant, and received reports from the police, fire, water, sewer, street and animal control personnel. The Council then approved the disaster response team report. Bids for garbage collection in the city limits were reviewed from GFL and Get Rid of It, both private companies. After hearing from representatives of both firms, the Council voted to accept the bid from GFL and begin negotiations for a contract. Current plans being negotiated include one-time-a-week residential pickup and twice-a-week commercial pickup. No price has yet to be approved. In other business, the Council voted to accept funds for a generator and computers, and to approve a bid for replacement of City Hall flooring. The Council then approved the appointment of Don Smith to the Hermitage Housing Authority Board. The consideration of levying some type city millage was tabled for further discussion. The Mayor reported on Community Fest 2021, Fall Festival, Spirit of Christmas and office remodel update. Coach Hembree stated he was excited with the prospects for the 2021 season, although it will be a difficult schedule starting out with a highly ranked 5A team to begin the year, followed by a highly ranked 4A team, a team from Louisiana, and starting the conference season with a highly ranked team. Several class 8-4A opponents will be good and Warren will have to continue to develop and play well every week. The Lumberjacks have nine starters returning on offense and eight on defense. Coach Hembree says he has a good sophomore class and many of them will provide depth. Warren is rated number three in class 4A by Hootens, and number four by other publications. They should be fun to watch. Fans are urged to come out and support the young men as they carry forward the tradition of Lumberjack Football. The first regular season game is set for Friday night, September 3 at White Hall against the highly ranked class 5A Bulldogs. The game will kickoff at 7:00pm.

All friends and family are invited to attend. This annual event is held the first Saturday in September each year. Hope you can make it... We want to take this week to remind Arkansans to obey all traffic laws whenever they are near a school bus. It is illegal to pass a stopped school bus whenever its red lights are flashing, as students are present. The fines, penalties, and punishment for anyone found guilty of illegally passing a stopped school bus were increased dramatically by Act 2128 of 2005, also known as Isaac’s Law. The legislation was named in honor of Isaac Brian, an elementary school student in the Bryant School District who was struck and killed when a driver illegally passed his school bus while students were exiting the vehicle. The law requires drivers to stop on two-lane and four-lane highways in both directions, even those with a middle lane. Drivers cannot attempt to pass in any direction until the school bus vehicle has finished receiving or discharging its passengers and is in motion again. In the 2021 Regular Session, the General Assembly passed Act 264 to clarify the distance and areas where drivers must stop. It states drivers must come to a complete stop no less than 30 feet from the bus when it stops to load or unload passengers. This 30 feet perimeter would apply to public roads, private or public property open to the general public, and any driveway or parking lot belonging to a public school. It is estimated that close to 350,000 students ride a school bus. Buses make stops in every Arkansas community. Remember: Flashing Red means Kids Ahead.

Korean-American relations as the new Global Center for K-Food hosts an inaugural event to celebrate the Lunar New Year. Han-Seok Seo, professor of sensory and consumer science for the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station, founded the Global Center for K-Food in December to promote innovation in food science and agricultural technology centered on Korean food. The Lunar New Year event will take place from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the Food Science Building, 2650 N. Young Ave., in Fayetteville. Because of space limitations, the event will be held over three, 40-minute sessions beginning at 11 a.m., noon and 1 p.m. Each session can accommodate about 35 people. For those would like to attend the event, please make reservations online. The Global Center for K-Food is a part of the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station, the research arm of the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture. ""Our center is dedicated to playing an instrumental role in fostering diverse, healthy, and sustainable global food systems, underpinned by robust research, education, and outreach initiatives,"" Seo said. ""Diversity includes research methods and research populations, as well as research topics and interdisciplinary research projects."" Seo said the center\'s objectives include fostering collaborative research, especially food-related projects, between U.S. and Korean researchers and professionals, education and outreach, culinary diplomacy, and entrepreneurship activation. Part of that education and outreach, he said, will be to conduct workshops, seminars and public events to raise awareness of the health benefits of the Korean diet, the innovations of food-tech and dining environment, and the impact of cultural diversity. Seo also envisions the center hosting international culinary events to bring together chefs, food enthusiasts and scholars ""to showcase the richness of Korean gastronomy."" Jeyam Subbiah, professor and food science department, said the Global Center for K-Food will foster innovation and collaboration in the food industry by developing Korean and fusion foods that cater to the diverse needs of consumers. Faculty and graduate students in the department of food science come from various cultures, Subbiah pointed out. ""Through research, extension and producing a workforce exposed to dynamic international food trends, we support the global food industry,"" Subbiah said. ""This center will strengthen and add a distinct flavor to our portfolio, fostering innovation and collaboration in the food industry by developing Korean and fusion foods that cater to the diverse needs of consumers."" By exploring Korean cuisine and its links to other cultures, Subbiah said food science students will learn how to develop fusion foods, ""which combine the best of different culinary traditions."" KOREA AND ARKANSAS While Arkansas may not be as universally acknowledged for its Korean presence as some other states, Seo said Korean culture is woven into its fabric with such features as the American Taekwondo Association Headquarters, the Arkansas Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History in Little Rock, and a growing community of Korean start-up companies in northwest Arkansas. Seo, who first temporarily visited the United States in 2003, pointed out that 2023 was the 120th anniversary of the arrival of the first 102 Korean immigrants to the United States and the 70th anniversary of the alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea. ""With no existing center dedicated to K-Food in the United States and beyond, this initiative, aligned with the 70th anniversary of the alliance, promises abundant opportunities for mutual growth in research, education, and culinary diplomacy,"" Seo said. The Feb. 9 event will recognize those historical numbers by offering 102 bowls of Tteokguk -- a sliced rice cake soup -- to participants. Tteokguk, a traditional Korean dish, is customarily savored during the Lunar New Year Day. Seo said the dish features ""thinly sliced rice cakes simmered in a rich meat broth, garnished with julienned cooked eggs, tender marinated meat, and finely shredded dried seaweed, creating a harmonious blend of appearance, flavors, and textures."" Coincidentally, Seo\'s office number in the food science department is 102. KOREAN CULTURE Though Koreans have been in the U.S. for more than a century, aspects of Korean culture have recently risen in popularity such as the Korean pop music known as ""K-Pop,"" from groups like BTS, and ""K-Dramas,"" including the Netflix series ""Squid Game."" Korean cuisine has followed suit. According to The Food Institute, interest in Korean food rose 90 percent in the 12 months before Jan. 2022. Arkansas and South Korea share some similarities, Seo said, including a focus on rice and chicken as foods, and four distinct seasons. Korean-style fried chicken was selected as the favorite Korean food outside of Korea, according to a recent survey by Korea\'s Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs and its affiliated Korean Food Promotion Institute. Kimchi, a traditional Korean dish with salted and fermented vegetables, was the most well-known Korean food but not the favorite dish of international consumers, the survey noted. In terms of recognizability, kimchi was followed by bibimbap, which is rice mixed with meat, vegetables, and spicy pepper paste; Korean-style fried chicken; bulgogi, marinated grilled meat; and gogigui, barbecued meat. When asked about their perceptions of Korean food, respondents called it ""savory,"" ""reasonably priced,"" ""popular,"" and ""recently trendy."" With 60 percent of the 9,000 respondents in 18 major international cities saying they know Korean food ""well,"" the survey indicates a growing familiarity with the nation\'s cuisine. In a symbolic gesture, the Global Center for K-Food was founded on the 2023 winter solstice, the year\'s shortest day, signifying ""new beginnings and the promise of a brighter future ahead,"" Seo said. ""Just like many major corporations that originated in garages, the Global Center for K-Food too had its humble beginnings in a small corner of my lab,"" Seo added. ""However, this center is destined to expand into an international nexus for showcasing and exploring K-Food, along with its associated technology and culture."" Growth of the center is expected to be fueled by interdisciplinary and international partnerships involving students, staff, faculty and professionals from the University of Arkansas System and various other institutions and countries. ""The essence of such interdisciplinary, diverse and harmonious collaborations is reflected in the center\'s logo, which portrays a bowl of colorful bibimbap,"" Seo said, expressing his dedication. In bibimbap, the term ""bibim"" signifies ""mixing,"" while ""bap"" refers to cooked rice, symbolizing a harmonious blend of cooked rice intermingled with meat, various vegetables, spicy pepper paste, and a touch of sesame oil, creating a colorful and flavorful culinary experience.

have been hit with the ultimate punishment for violating New York\'s powerful anti-fraud law. An Associated Press analysis of nearly 70 years of civil cases under the law showed that such a penalty has only been imposed a dozen previous times, and Trump\'s case stands apart in a significant way: It\'s the only big business found that was threatened with a shutdown without a showing of obvious victims and major losses. Lawyers for the state in Trump\'s monthslong civil trial have argued that the principles of fair play in business alone are enough to justify a harsh penalty, but even they aren\'t calling for the prospect of liquidation of his businesses and properties raised by a judge. And some legal experts worry that if the judge goes out of his way to punish the former president with that worst-case scenario, it could make it easier for courts to wipe out companies in the future. ""This is a basically a death penalty for a business,"" said Columbia University law professor Eric Talley. ""Is he getting his just desserts because of the fraud, or because people don\'t like him?"" AP\'s review of nearly 150 reported cases since New York\'s ""repeated fraud"" statute was passed in 1956 showed that nearly every previous time a company was taken away, victims and losses were key factors. Customers had lost money or bought defective products or never received services ordered, leaving them cheated and angry. What\'s more, businesses were taken over almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress and protect potential victims. They included a phony psychologist who sold dubious treatments, a fake lawyer who sold false claims he could get students into law school, and businessmen who marketed financial advice but instead swindled people out of their home deeds. In Trump\'s case, his company stopped sending exaggerated financial figures about his net worth to Deutsche Bank and others at least two years ago, but a court-appointed monitor noted that was only after he was sued and that other financial documents continued to contain errors and misrepresentations. And though the bank offered Trump lower interest rates because he had agreed to personally guarantee the loans with his own money, it\'s not clear how much better the rates were because of the inflated figures.

Added University of Michigan law professor William Thomas, ""Who suffered here? We haven\'t seen a long list of victims."" \'DISSOLUTION\' OF AN EMPIRE? Trump, the Republican presidential frontrunner, has focused his ire at potentially losing his business at both the Democratic New York attorney general who brought the case and the judge presiding over it. In an order last September that\'s currently under appeal, State Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron said Trump had indeed committed fraud and should have the state certificates needed to run many of his New York companies revoked. He said Trump should then be stripped of control over those companies, which are the official owners of his Fifth Avenue headquarters and other marquee properties, and have them turned over to a receiver who will manage the ""dissolution"" of them. What the judge left unclear is what he meant by ""dissolution,"" whether that referred to the liquidation of entities that control properties or the properties themselves. Asked specifically in court whether Trump\'s buildings would be literally sold off as in a bankruptcy, Engoron said he would clarify at a later date. In a worst case, as interpreted by legal experts, Engoron could decide dissolution means stripping the real estate mogul of not only of his New York holdings such as Trump Tower and his 40 Wall Street skyscraper, but his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, a Chicago hotel and condo building, and several golf clubs, including ones in Miami, Los Angeles and Scotland. For her part, New York Attorney General Letitia James has asked that Trump be banned from doing business in New York and pay $370 million, what she estimates is saved interest and other ""ill-gotten gains."" But she never asked for a property sale and may not even want one. Said one of her lawyers, Kevin Wallace, in his closing argument, ""I don\'t think we are looking for anything that would cause the liquidation of business."" Engoron said that by Jan. 31 he will issue a ruling that is expected to decide on the cash penalty and business ban and clarify his ""dissolution"" order. A HISTORY OF PUNISHMENTS Notably, New York\'s anti-fraud statute, known as Executive Law 63(12), is clear that a finding of fraud does not require intent to deceive or that anyone actually gets duped or loses money. The attorney general must only show ""repeated fraudulent or illegal acts."" But the AP analysis, based on a search of reported 63(12) cases in legal databases LexisNexis and Westlaw, found that victims and losses were factors when it came to deciding whether to take over a business. A breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago, for instance, for using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director salaries, perks and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms, research and help for survivors. A private equity firm faking big investment success was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors. A mental health facility was shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds while neglecting patients. There may be more dissolved companies than AP found. Legal experts caution that some 63(12) cases never show up in legal databases because they were settled, dropped or otherwise not reported. Still, the only case the AP found of a business dissolved under the anti-fraud law without citing actual victims or losses was a relatively small company closed in 1972 for writing term papers for college students. In that case, the attorney general said the victim was ""the integrity of the educational process."" This is not Trump\'s first run-in with New York\'s anti-fraud law. His nonprofit Trump Foundation agreed to shut down in 2018 over allegations he misused funds for political and business interests. And his Trump University was sued under the law in 2013 for allegedly misleading thousands of students with false promises of success but it had closed before it could be shuttered by the courts. Trump eventually settled this and related cases for $25 million. Decades of 63(12) legal history also showed many cases where defendants socked customers with big losses and still got to keep running their businesses. A judge in 2001 declined to appoint a receiver to take over a porn site despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers who thought they were getting ""free tours."" In fact, the owners tried to cover up their tricks and shifted money overseas. Still, the judge said appointing a receiver was an ""extraordinary remedy"" that should be used sparingly and that a preliminary injunction was good enough. Years later, prosecutors in a separate criminal case said the Gambino mob family was running the business and put several operators in prison. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden, usurious interest rates got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn\'t commit fraud in the future. And a judge refused a request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011 after a customer drowned and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides or none at all. Instead, he ordered only that the owner post a $50,000 bond and clean up his act. The company is still being run, under a different name, by the same family today. TRUMP\'S CASE Trump\'s case involved 11 years of financial statements with values based on disputed and sometimes outright false descriptions of properties used as collateral should his loans go bust. Among them: Trump exaggerated the size of his Manhattan penthouse apartment by three times. He listed unfinished buildings as if they were complete, and apartments under rent-control as if they were free of such rules. He showed restricted funds as if they were liquid cash.

Willis hired special prosecutor Nathan Wade in November 2021 to assist her investigation into whether the Republican ex-president and others broke any laws as they tried to overturn his loss in the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Since Trump and 18 others were indicted in August, Wade has led the team of lawyers Willis assembled to prosecute the case. Among the acts listed in the indictment was a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call in which Trump urged fellow Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ""find"" the 11,780 votes needed to overturn his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump has pleaded not guilty, and his attorneys have said he was within his rights to challenge election results. The filing was the first time that Willis or Wade has directly addressed the allegations of a relationship in the nearly four weeks since they first surfaced in a filing by a defendant in the election case. In an affidavit accompanying the filing, Wade said that in 2022, he and the district attorney had developed a personal relationship in addition to their ""professional association and friendship."" But he also said that he had never lived with Willis or shared a financial account or household expenses with her. He said that none of the funds paid to him as part of the job have been shared with Willis, an attempt to undercut defense lawyer claims of a conflict of interest. Wade described himself and Willis as ""both financially independent professionals; expenses or personal travel were roughly divided equally between us."" ""At times,"" Wade said, ""I have made and purchased travel for District Attorney Willis and myself from my personal funds. At other times District Attorney Willis has made and purchased travel for she and I from her personal funds."" ""I have no financial interest in the outcome of the 2020 election interference case or in the conviction of any defendant,"" he wrote. The Friday filing by Willis\' team came in response to a motion filed last month by defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant, who represents Trump co-defendant Michael Roman. The motion alleged that Willis and Wade were in an inappropriate romantic relationship that created a conflict of interest. The filing seeks to dismiss the case and to have Willis and Wade and their offices barred from further prosecuting the case. Trump and at least one other co-defendant, Georgia attorney Robert Cheeley, have filed motions to join Roman\'s effort to dismiss the indictment and remove Willis from the case. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who\'s presiding over the election case, has set a Feb. 15 hearing on Roman\'s motion. Willis and Wade are among a dozen witnesses Merchant has subpoenaed to testify at that hearing. The Friday filing asks McAfee to dismiss the motions without a hearing, saying they ""have no merit."" Willis\' team\'s filing argues that Willis has no financial or personal conflict of interest that justifies removing her or her office from the case. It also calls the attacks on Wade\'s qualifications ""factually inaccurate, unsupported, and malicious."" The filing calls the allegations raised ""salacious"" and says they ""garnered the media attention they were designed to obtain."" Trump and other critics of Willis, an elected Democrat, have capitalized on allegations about the relationship between Willis and Wade, using them to try to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the case. The former president has also accused Willis -- and the prosecutors in three other criminal cases against him -- of engaging in political attacks as he appears poised to become the 2024 Republican nominee for president. Roman\'s motion questions Wade\'s qualifications to be involved in a complex prosecution under Georgia\'s anti-racketeering law. The response from the district attorney fiercely defended Wade\'s qualifications to lead the prosecution team, saying he ""has long distinguished himself as an exceptionally talented litigator with significant trial experience."" Exhibits attached to the filing include pictures of awards Wade has received over the years for his legal work. Willis also attached Facebook posts from Merchant in 2016 supporting Wade\'s campaign to become a Cobb County Superior Court judge. In one post, Merchant described Wade as ""ethical"" and said he has ""demonstrated his ability to be fair and impartial."" Roman\'s motion also accused Willis of personally profiting from the case, saying she had paid Wade more than $650,000 for his work and then benefited when Wade used his earnings to pay for vacations the pair took together. Roman\'s motion did not include any concrete proof for the allegations of a romantic relationship between Willis and Wade. But in a filing in Wade\'s divorce case, his wife included credit card statements that showed Wade had bought plane tickets for Willis to travel with him to San Francisco and Miami. Also Friday, U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, sent Willis a subpoena for any documents or communications related to her office\'s receipt and use of federal funds, as well as any documents or communications referring or relating to any allegations of the misuse of federal funds by her office. ""We are proud of our grant programs and our partnership with the Department of Justice that makes Fulton County a safer, more just place,"" Willis said Friday in a statement responding to Jordan\'s subpoena. Jordan has sent several letters to Willis since September requesting information. Each time, she has refused to send the requested information, saying the congressman\'s requests violate the principles of federalism and separation of powers and accusing him of trying to interfere with a criminal prosecution. ------ Associated Press writers Eric Tucker in Washington and Alanna Durkin Richer in Boston contributed.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'LOCAL COLUMNIST February 4, 2024 at 12:00 a.m. by Richard Mason As I do my walk-run, which has become a lot more walk than run, I usually try to kill the boredom by thinking of what I could write about. Of course, a columnist must write an original column, which means no repeats. Well, I\'m somewhere north of 300 columns, and I\'ve covered a lot of ground both figuratively and metaphorically. The next part of being a good columnist is he or she must write something that is of interest to Arkansas readers. This past week, as I headed north toward Smackover, walking along the 167 Highway Bypass, one of the first flashes of interest was the amount of roadside trash. In my several years of walking-jogging, I\'ve spotted and sometimes picked up trash items, everything from a kitten to a Bible. By the way; the kitten was adopted, and it is doing well. Of course, most of the stuff along the side of the road was and is just trash. Beer and soft drink cans, Styrofoam cups, or whatever was in the back of pickup trucks whizzing along at 75 miles an hour make up most of the roadside trash, and from my traveling both foreign and domestic, I can confidently say Arkansas\'s roadway are in the top category when it comes to how much trash is there. Then, as I kept thinking of things to write about, it occurred to me that if we take a deeper look at the amount of trash not only along our roads, but in our downtowns, we are a nation of litterers. That\'s right, and if there is something we all have in common, it is that we litter. Although we might not throw beer cans out our truck\'s window, we are guilty of littering. Let me explain: Over the past couple of weeks with all the ice, sleet, and snow, most city trash trucks didn\'t run. Of course, a heavy frost will shut down a lot of schools and city services, but these past weeks were true work or study from home times. Was it climate change caused by global warming? You\'re damn right it was. ""Yes, Virginia global warming is real!"" The ice, snow, and cold records are a direct result of global warming. For some reason, the Arctic and Antarctic are heating faster than the rest of the planet, and that allows the Arctic and Antarctic Vortexes to break out and send out wave after wave of super fridge air. Now, back to the litter column. In a couple of days, trash built up to the point where city and private dumpsters were overflowing until a lot of trash was just thrown on the ground beside the dumpster. I was shocked at the amount of trash that was in the dumpsters or piled beside them from just a few days of no pickups. We, and that includes yours truly, are trashy people. I know you may say ""So what? That trash is going to a land fill."" Yes, most of it is, but that still makes it trash, and the tons upon tons of trash is just moved from one trash pile to another. Did it ever occur to you that global warming, which is causing climate change, is caused by the unnecessary use of energy it takes to produce those daily tons upon tons of trash? Or how much wasted energy it takes to incinerate the daily trash? 2023 was the hottest year on record, and 2024 looks on target to break that record, and the bottom line to this heating is wasted energy. That is how we litter in an indirect way. Let\'s say you purchase aspirins at the store. You take the little box home, open it up and take the aspirin bottle out. Then you toss the box and the cotton from the bottle in the trash. Right? Okay, now consider this and multiply it by a billion or so worldwide, and consider how much energy is just wasted and percolates carbon up into the atmosphere. We are a nation in a world of Wasted Energy People, and you and I litter every time we use one use items. It is obvious that unless there is a cataclysmic shift in attitude that we are going to continue that wasteful habit. Of course, our spineless legislature could pass laws prohibiting the commercial use of one-use items, in stores and food outlets. That would mean no plastic straws, or spoons, or Styrofoam cups, no plastic bags and all bottled drinks would be in returnable bottles. Oh, it will happen after searing summer heat of 130 degrees turns fall into summer and summer into hell. Unless we wake up and kick some legislature\'s collective butts, it is going to take living with Hell on Earth to start the ball rolling. We should treat every item we use as whether it is litter or non-litter. It can be done, but with the current shrug your shoulders and mutter, ""Hot \'nough for ya?"" response, our children and grandchildren and going to live in a Hell on Earth because we obviously don\'t give a ****. Of course, not only will they have to suffer through the heat, millions of climate refuges will flood the borders of more temperate countries, and the thousands we see fleeing from Central America to the United States will be replace by millions both in North America, but also in temperate Europe. But not only do we refuse to legislative any commonsense anti-littering laws, we don\'t enforce the ones we have. When I was on the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality Commission, we pushed the Arkansas Highway Department to raise the fine for littering to $1000, and they did. Hundreds of litter report calls later, but not one fine of $1000 has been levied. Okay, I think I have made my point: we are a state in a nation full of litterers. You litter, I litter, and we all litter, but until that little fact sinks into our backwards brains, we are going to set record after record temperatures until probably our grandchildren are going to have to enact draconian laws to reverse global warming because the drastic climate changes portends to destroy our civilization as we know it.
