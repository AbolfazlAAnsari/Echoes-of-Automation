(CBS 58) -- For years, discussions about legalizing marijuana in Wisconsin have stalled, but Republican legislative leaders are now showing interest in passing legislation to legalize cannabis for medical purposes in the new year. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said his caucus plans to unveil a medical marijuana bill in January. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Rochester) believes there\'s a ""path"" to passing medical marijuana legislation in his chamber. ""Most Assembly Republicans I talk to are in favor of some version of medical marijuana and it\'s taken us a while to make sure we have the votes,"" Vos said. Vos did not reveal the details of what\'s included in the bill, but he suggested it would reflect some aspects of Minnesota\'s medical marijuana program that launched in 2015. This year Minnesota became the 23rd state to legalize recreational cannabis. Prior to that, it was only legal to use in some forms for medical purposes such as oils, pills and other non-smokeable products. Vos says support is building in his caucus for a similar medical marijuana program in Wisconsin. ""When [Minnesota] started their program, it wasn\'t widespread, it wasn\'t on every street corner, it wasn\'t like other states have done - it was more of a controlled mechanism,"" Vos said. Senate Republicans are also moving closer to backing medical marijuana, LeMahieu said. ""The devil is always in the details on a bill like that, but I think there is a path to get it through our caucus,"" LeMahieu said. Both Vos and LeMahieu have previously said they only support launching a medical marijuana program that focuses on treating chronic pain. While there are few known details about the GOP bill, proposals to legalize cannabis for medical and recreational purposes have yet to gain momentum in the Republican-controlled legislature. Last year was the first time a marijuana proposal received a public hearing since 2009, but the bill never advanced out of committee. That proposal, authored by Republican Sen. Mary Felzkowski, would have partially legalized cannabis for medical purposes. Felzkowski, who\'s reportedly working on a medical cannabis bill, did not respond to request for comment. Any bill that is proposed is unlikely to receive praise from Democrats. Many are opposed to restrictive marijuana laws and prefer measures to legalize cannabis for recreational use. Democratic Senator Melissa Agard, a longtime champion of cannabis legalization, was skeptical about Republicans\' commitment to medical marijuana. ""The bills that have been brought forth in previous sessions have missed the mark for our caucus,"" Agard said. ""If we are actually going to address the public safety issues, if we are actually going to address people\'s access…full legalization is the way to go."" Gov. Tony Evers’ 2023-25 biennial budget included a plan to legalize marijuana for individuals 21 or older, but it was quickly rejected by Republicans. Polling has shown broad support for a marijuana program in Wisconsin. Sixty-nine percent of Wisconsin residents support legalizing marijuana, according to polling conducted by Marquette University Law School last year. Even more Wisconsinites, 83%, said they back legalizing medical marijuana if it\'s prescribed by a doctor a similar MU poll found in 2019.'}]"

shortages MADISON (WKOW) -- A new policy brief places the blame for ongoing drug shortages at hospitals at the feet of a few massive middlemen in the healthcare supply marketplace. The American Economic Liberties Project published the brief Thursday. Titled ""The Dirty Secret of Drug Shortages,"" it levels a lot of blame on group purchasing organizations (GPO) for the shortage of basic drugs like painkillers and chemotherapy drugs. ""[Shortages] may not affect every single one of Wisconsin residents,"" Sara Sirota, the brief\'s author said. ""But there are certainly populations, whether it be cancer patients, whether it be parents of newborns, people that need pain relievers in hospitals that are simply not able to get the medications that they need."" Hospitals across the country, and in Wisconsin, have long struggled to keep adequate stocks of many cheap generic drugs used in to treat many ailments. ""The shortage crisis that we currently are facing is unprecedented,"" Sirota said. GPOs act as middlemen, helping hospitals buy drugs and other medical supplies from manufacturers. A GPO will represent multiple hospitals in a bid to buy at a bulk discount. ""The overwhelming majority of 5,000 or so hospitals basically go to these three middlemen to get the supplies that they need,"" Sirota said, in referenced to the few largest GPOs who dominate the market with their buying power. The GPO business model is based on charging the manufacturers for the right to sell to member hospitals. ""These middlemen exert so much pressure on manufacturers, specifically on the low cost generic drugs that are currently in shortage, that no manufacturer wants to make them,"" Sirota said. Shortages have forced local hospitals like SSM Health St. Mary\'s to adapt and come up with creative solutions. Drug shortages have persisted for so long that SSM Health now has codified processes for managing them. The healthcare provider helped found CivicaRx in 2018. CivicaRx is a nonprofit that manufacturers generic medications for member hospitals. But the 60 medications it makes are far from everything a hospital needs. The American Economic Liberties Project policy brief advocates for the government to regulate GPOs. Without some kind of large scale change, shortages are likely to persist.

In a video obtained by CBS 58, you can see the moments leading up to a deadly crash. ""Clothes and belongings all over the road, carnage from the car,"" that’s the scene Normandin witnessed in front of the famous custard stand when the crash happened. ""I barely got to the exit of Cousins when I seen them go through, so luckily I had a good couple of feet,"" said Normandin. As seen on video, a Chevy Equinox was speeding south on 27th Street and ran through a red light. The Equinox hit a Chevy Cruz, which was heading east on Oklahoma Avenue. The impact of the crash flipped the Equinox several times down 27th Street. The car would eventually come to a stop after hitting a light pole in front of Leon\'s Frozen Custard. Police said the Equinox had two people inside; the passenger, a 22-year-old woman, was pronounced dead on the scene. The driver was taken to Froedtert Hospital listed in critical condition. ""This is an ongoing thing, the racing down the street at great speed,"" said Ronald Schneider, owner of Leon\'s. Schneider has been on 27th Street for more than 40 years, and he said speeding on the stretch of road has been a constant issue. ""We see it all the time, and all you can do is cross your fingers and hope it doesn’t end up like it did last night,"" said Schneider. Schneider called on city leaders to step in. ""Why don’t we react before the problem? Why don’t we fix it before it gets to this point?"" said Schneider. According to public records, there have been 21 crashes year to date at the intersection of 27th and Oklahoma. Updated on Dec. 13 at 5:27 a.m. MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- A 22-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene of a car accident near 27th and Oklahoma Tuesday, Dec. 12, and police say the driver is currently hospitalized in critical condition.

LAFAYETTE COUNTY (WKOW) -- A Darlington couple is facing dozens of charges after investigators say they let nearly 200 goats die in their care. Stephanie and Kyle Lincicum are charged with 20 counts of mistreatment of animals, 20 counts of intentionally failing to provide food for an animal, along with timely disposition of known carcasses and theft. Court records show the Lincicums came to an agreement with the farm property owner that they would take over operations and eventually purchase the farm from her. Investigators with the Lafayette County Sheriff\'s Office said it turned south when the Farm Service Agency called to report a number of deceased goats on the property. Sheriff Reg Gill said deputies soon learned there were nearly 200 goats on the farm with only two still alive but barely standing up. ""By tracking records through feed companies and things like that, it had been quite some time since they\'ve actually purchased any feed,"" Gill said. According to the criminal complaint, investigators brought a veterinarian to the scene who observed the deceased goats. She reported signs of starvation and signs of \'no flowing water for weeks\'. The sheriff and veterinarian made the decision to euthanize the two remaining goats who they claimed were extremely weak and \'did not have a single ounce of fat on their bodies.\' When asked what happened to the goats, the complaint states the Lincicums claimed the goats got sick a few years ago and were treated for worms, parasites and pneumonia. However, the couple said after the vet treated the goats, they kept dying. Deputies asked if they called the vet to come back but documents show they did not. Instead, investigators report more goats were purchased and those eventually died too. ""This was brought on just by lack of taking care of them,"" Gill said. ""And obviously very devastating to see that many animals just left to die."" Court documents also show the couple is accused of selling several of the goats and making a profit of more than $37,000. Gill said the couple technically did not own the goats and did not have the right to sell them in the first place without the owner\'s consent. ""They reported that they were putting the money back into the farm,"" he added. ""However, it doesn\'t appear that that was the case."" Instead, investigators believe they used the money for their own needs. A woman who knows the couple said she sadly isn\'t shocked. ""It\'s just heartbreaking to think about,"" she said. Adding, ""Just imagine all of those babies crying, just the noise that they would have been making."" The woman said there is no excuse or reason for someone to hurt an innocent animal. If found guilty, the couple could both serve prison time. ""To have a situation where they\'re just not fed and basically starved to death, that\'s very unusual for for us [county],"" Gill said.

When talking about Wolfe Tuesday, Vos said there are problems that have ""in some ways"" already been addressed.

""We had Ron Johnson get reelected to the United States Senate. So, I think we need to move forward and talk about the issues that matter to most Wisconsinites. And that is not, for most Wisconsinites, obsessing about Meagan Wolfe,"" Vos said. Five Assembly Republicans brought forward 15 articles of impeachment against Wolfe in September. The Wisconsin Elections Commission staff put together what they\'re calling a fact check document countering false claims in each article. For example, one article of impeachment states Wolfe unlawfully failed to remove names from the state\'s voter roll, while WEC says removing names from the voter roll is illegal and keeping names on the roll but changing current voter status is a tool to protect against fraud. Vos says though he can\'t predict the future it\'s unlikely a vote on Wolfe\'s status will come up any time soon.

Musk’s latest decision builds on the growing rift between the platform and news organizations who for years used it to build their audiences. Among his more controversial moves was a decision to upend the site’s verification system. Under Twitter’s previous leadership, journalists — no matter how small their outlet — could receive a blue checkmark next to their username that verified they were who they said they were. Celebrities and other public figures could also receive a verification. That changed when Musk ended the verification process and Twitter started doling out blue checkmarks to anyone who wanted one — without verifying their identity — as long as they pay a monthly subscription fee.

New York (CNN) — Rupert Murdoch, the powerful right-wing media mogul who built and oversaw one of the world’s most influential news empires, announced Thursday that he will step down as chairman of his companies, Fox Corporation and News Corporation. “For my entire professional life, I have been engaged daily with news and ideas, and that will not change,” Murdoch, 92, wrote in a memo to employees. “But the time is right for me to take on different roles, knowing that we have truly talented teams.” As the leader of Fox and News Corporation, which publishes influential broadsheets such as The Wall Street Journal and tabloid New York Post, Murdoch has for decades commanded considerable influence in the Republican Party, matched by only a select few. His retirement comes at a key moment in the media industry as entrenched entertainment giants confront a sweeping transformation of the traditional television and film business and consumers rapidly gravitate toward streaming services. Murdoch’s decision to step down as chairman of his companies will also send shockwaves through the political world, just as the 2024 presidential race heats up. Fox News remains ensnared in litigation stemming from the network’s peddling of former President Donald Trump’s election lies in the wake of the 2020 election. Stepping into his shoes, Murdoch’s eldest son, Lachlan, who already serves as chief executive of Fox Corporation, will become sole chairman of both companies. Murdoch described Lachlan as “a passionate, principled leader.” It’s unclear if Fox’s direction will change under Lachlan, but Rupert signaled that Lachlan will maintain the right-wing editorial bent his media companies are known for. “My father firmly believed in freedom, and Lachlan is absolutely committed to the cause,” Murdoch told employees in his memo. “Self- serving bureaucracies are seeking to silence those who would question their provenance and purpose. Elites have open contempt for those who are not members of their rarefied class. Most of the media is in cahoots with those elites, peddling political narratives rather than pursuing the truth.” Rupert Murdoch, who assured staffers he is in “robust health,” said that in his new role as chairman emeritus he would still be “involved every day in the contest of ideas.” However, Lachlan Murdoch has privately criticized Trump, saying that he disagrees with much of the way the former President behaves, people familiar with the matter told CNN last year. In some comments, Murdoch had gone as far as to tell people that he believes if Trump were to run again, it would be bad for the country. Murdoch’s foray into the media business began in the 1950s with a small Australian newspaper chain, In 1969, Murdoch landed his first major overseas prize with the purchase of the UK’s News of the World. He went on to acquire The Sun and The Times and The Sunday Times of London, building a newspaper empire that gave him unrivaled reach and political influence in Britain. Murdoch became a major Hollywood executive in 1985 when he purchased Twentieth Century Fox from oilman Marvin Davis for $600 million. In 1986, Murdoch got into the television business after he purchased several US television stations and created Fox Broadcasting. He launched UK satellite pay-TV broadcaster Sky in 1989, before merging it with a major rival just a year later after a bruising price war. But his UK empire foundered two decades later as a consequence of a hacking scandal at the News of the World. Murdoch shut the Sunday tabloid – one of Britain’s oldest and best-selling newspapers — in July 2011 amid public outrage over allegations that the outlet had illegally eavesdropped on murder and terror victims, politicians and celebrities. The scandal forced him to abandon a bid to take control of Sky. He made another bid for the pay-TV broadcaster in 2016, but it became ensnared by UK media regulators who worried that the deal would give the Murdoch family too much influence in Britain and concerns over its commitment to uphold UK broadcasting standards. Comcast swooped in at the last minute and outbid Fox for Sky. Murdoch sold much of his media empire, including the Twentieth Century Fox film studio, to Disney in a massive $71 billion deal in 2019. He was left with a much leaner broadcast portfolio, consisting of Fox News and Fox Sports. Fox News launched in 1996 as a conservative startup competitor to CNN. It eventually became the top cable news channel in America by playing into conservative narratives. The channel, however, veered from its roots in conservative news as former President Donald Trump ascended to power in the Republican Party in 2015, becoming an unabashed home of right-wing propaganda aimed at propping up the scandal-ridden White House. In recent years, under Murdoch, Fox News has advanced baseless conspiracy theories, including the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential election. The lies Fox News pushed about the election spawned two massive defamation lawsuits from voting technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic. Fox earlier this year settled the Dominion lawsuit for a historic $787.5 million. The Smartmatic lawsuit, however, continues to make its way through the court system. Fox News announced Murdoch’s retirement on its air Thursday morning, with anchor Bill Hemmer praising the network’s founder. “Rupert Murdoch created all of this and so much more across America and the globe,” Hemmer said. “His life’s work has left an indelible imprint on the global media landscape. His contributions are both innumerable and extraordinary and we thank him for letting us be a part of it all.” “Without him, we would not be here,” anchor Dana Perino added.
