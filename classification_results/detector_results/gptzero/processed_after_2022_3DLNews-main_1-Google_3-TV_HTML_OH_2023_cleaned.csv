Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:50 pm Assignment Editor LIMA, OH (WLIO) - Marijuana has been legal for adults to use in Ohio for a few weeks now, but a lot of people don’t really know what that means. Since Ohio lawmakers failed to make changes to the voter approved law before it took effect on December 7th, law enforcement is using the language that was on the ballot. If you are 21 years and older, it is legal to consume cannabis on your property, not in public. People are allowed to grow up to 6 plants for an individual, or 12 for a household. Despite it being legal, there is still no place to legally buy it and that may not happen until late 2024. People are not allowed to sell marijuana but you are allowed to give 6 plants or a small amount of marijuana to another adult. Police stress that is a very small amount that you are allowed to carry on you. “Possession is again when you are out and about, whether you are traveling in your car or walking down the street, it’s a very, very small amount,” says Major James Baker, Lima Police Department. “The product, more of the raw product that kind of thing, it’s 2.5 ounces, which is very, very small. The extract, that when it goes through this process, you get 15 grams. You are talking about a very, very small amount. “ The rules for being impaired from marijuana have not changed. “Don’t drive under the influence,” adds Baker. “Check with your employers. Just because it is legal, like alcohol. Alcohol is legal, but you can’t go into your workplace intoxicated. You can’t drink during your work times. So, I am sure those things will still carry over. But check with your employer to get clarification on that.” Baker says that marijuana is still illegal on a federal level, which creates some issues with Ohio’s new law.

The United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on Wednesday announced that an additional six arrests have been made in an alleged conspiracy to sell human body parts on the Internet that involved a former Cumberland County man last year. Jeremy Pauley, 41, whom court records list as a resident of Bloomsburg, but was called an Enola resident by police at the time of his arrest last August, was the first to be charged in the conspiracy after police received numerous calls from those concerned about his sale of ""oddities"" online. The initial investigation determined Pauley had several human body parts in the basement of his Enola home, including human brains, a human heart, and other human organs, police said. A second alleged conspirator, Candace Chapman Scott, of Little Rock, Arkansas, was indicted in her state earlier this year for her alleged role in the conspiracy. She is accused of using her job at Arkansas Central Mortuary Services to access and sell human body parts to Pauley, including fetuses, brains, hearts, lungs, genitalia, large pieces of skin and other items. On Wednesday, U.S. Attorney Gerard M. Karam announced the indictment of several alleged co-conspirators. They are: The six suspects were indicted by a federal grand jury on conspiracy and interstate transport of stolen goods charges, Karam said. According to Karam, the indictments and information allege that a nationwide network of individuals bought and sold human remains stolen from Harvard Medical School, in addition to the Arkansas mortuary where Scott was employed. The charges allege that from 2018 through 2022, Cedric Lodge, who managed the morgue for the Anatomical Gifts Program at Harvard Medical School, located in Boston, Massachusetts, stole organs and other parts of cadavers donated for medical research and education before their scheduled cremations. Lodge at times transported stolen remains from Boston to his home, where he and his wife, Denise Lodge, sold the remains to Katrina Maclean, Joshua Taylor, and others, making arrangements via cellular telephone and social media websites. At times, Cedric Lodge allowed Maclean and Taylor to enter the morgue at Harvard Medical School and examine cadavers to choose what to purchase, the indictment claims. On some occasions, Taylor transported stolen remains back to Pennsylvania. On other occasions, the Lodges shipped stolen remains to Taylor and others out of state, according to the indictment. Maclean and Taylor resold the stolen remains to other people, including Pauley, for profit, Karam said. Pauley also purchased stolen human remains from Scott, who stole remains from her employer, according to Karam. Scott allegedly stole parts of cadavers she was supposed to have cremated, many of which had been donated to and used for research and educational purposes by an area medical school, as well as the corpses of two stillborn babies who were supposed to be cremated and returned as cremains to their families, the indictment claims. Scott sold the stolen remains to Pauley and shipped them to Pauley in Cumberland County. Pauley then allegedly sold many of the stolen remains he purchased to other individuals, including Matthew Lampi, according to Karam. Lampi and Pauley bought and sold from each other over an extended period of time and exchanged over $100,000 in online payments, Karam said. A preliminary hearing for Pauley, which has already been postponed five times, has been set for July 5, court records show. “Some crimes defy understanding,” said Karam. “The theft and trafficking of human remains strikes at the very essence of what makes us human. It is particularly egregious that so many of the victims here volunteered to allow their remains to be used to educate medical professionals and advance the interests of science and healing. For them and their families to be taken advantage of in the name of profit is appalling. With these charges, we are seeking to secure some measure of justice for all these victims.

From the beginning, this has been a multi-jurisdictional investigation, and our two offices have worked side by side to bring justice for these victims.” ""The defendants violated the trust of the deceased and their families all in the name of greed,"" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Jacqueline Maguire.

Please enter a search term. by: Ella Lee, Zach Schonfeld, The Hill Posted: Nov 20, 2023 / 01:52 PM EST Updated: Nov 21, 2023 / 08:05 PM EST by: Ella Lee, Zach Schonfeld, The Hill Posted: Nov 20, 2023 / 01:52 PM EST Updated: Nov 21, 2023 / 08:05 PM EST A three-judge appeals court panel expressed skepticism of former President Trump’s attempt to throw out the gag order in his federal 2020 election subversion case, but the judges Monday did seem open to narrowing the order’s scope. Trump’s legal team contends the gag order, which bars Trump from targeting key figures in his case — witnesses, special counsel Jack Smith and court staff — chills protected political speech in violation of Trump’s First Amendment rights. But that argument almost immediately received pushback from the panel of three judges, all appointed by Democratic presidents, who rigorously questioned whether the real-world threats that often follow Trump’s attacks should be preempted and the extent to which the former president’s 2024 campaign informs his counsel’s legal arguments. “Labeling it ‘core political speech’ begs the question of whether it is, in fact, political speech, or whether it is political speech aimed at derailing or corrupting the criminal justice system,” said Judge Patricia Millett, an Obama appointee. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan imposed the gag order last month upon prosecutors’ request, who cited Trump’s social media posts and other comments attacking individuals involved in the case since Trump was indicted on four felony charges in August. Trump pleaded not guilty. The gag order is on hold until the appeals panel issues its ruling. If Trump loses, his lawyers have vowed to take the issue to the Supreme Court. Millett was especially vocal during Monday’s argument, repeatedly pressing Trump attorney John Sauer with hypotheticals and appearing visibly frustrated at times. Millett questioned what speech would be banned under Trump’s proposed standard that wouldn’t already be criminal in itself. “The gag order in this case installs a single federal district judge as a filter for core political speech, leading presidential candidates and virtually every American voter in the United States at the very height of a presidential campaign,” said Sauer, a former Missouri solicitor general. Sauer contended that prosecutors had not shown sufficient evidence to impose the gag order, noting that many of the threats the government references in its request occurred in 2020. “Counsel, I think the concern is that it seems, at times, your position would be that the district court’s hands are tied until we actually know there has already been harm to the integrity of the trial,” said Judge Brad Garcia, an appointee of President Biden, to whom Trump lost in 2020. Sauer was accompanied in the courtroom by multiple other attorneys who have been representing Trump in the case, including John Lauro, Todd Blanche, Emil Bove and Gregory Singer. Trump himself did not attend. Smith was in attendance for Monday’s argument, sitting in the first row behind the prosecution table. Molly Gaston and Thomas Windom, two senior prosecutors on the case, sat in the row behind Smith. The prosecution — represented by Cecil VanDevender, an assistant special counsel — argued that Trump’s “well-established practice” of using his political platform to target adversaries poses a “significant and immediate risk to the fairness and integrity” of the case. He said some 16 people connected to Trump’s various legal cases have received threats after the former president pointed his rage in their direction, including the Democratic district attorneys who brought the New York and Georgia criminal cases against Trump and the New York judge presiding over the former president’s ongoing civil fraud trial. Trump’s online attacks have often resulted in real-world threats by his supporters against the former president’s purported foes. Millett noted that Trump has millions of social media followers, and that those named on his accounts are often “threatened and harassed.” “The notion that there was some dynamic that existed in 2020 that has since abated or gone stale I think is wrong,” VanDevender said. The panel on Monday, however, appeared not fully convinced by the government’s broad interpretation of the gag order, suggesting that its position “doesn’t seem to give much balance at all” to the protections afforded to political speech under the First Amendment. “The notion that high-profile public figures or governmental officials — who have taken on enormous responsibility, like prosecutors — can’t stand up to some inflammatory language seems to me to contradict Supreme Court precedent, and it seems to me sort of a very troubling lack of balance on the free speech side on the part of prosecution in this case,” Millett said. Judge Cornelia Pillard raised concern at one point about the gag order’s language, which restricts comments that “target” certain individuals. Trump’s attorneys are arguing it is unconstitutionally vague. “I think you’re right that that targeting does raise a little bit of unclarity,” said Pillard, an Obama appointee. The fine line prosecutors are asking the Appeals Court to draw was underlined during an exchange in which Millett questioned language that would or wouldn’t be allowed under the government’s ideal interpretation of the gag order. VanDevender repeatedly argued that attacks undermining any potential witness’s credibility would be unacceptable speech under their interpretation of the order. “Can he say they’re an untruth speaker?” Millett asked. “Yes,” VanDevender replied. Blanche, one of Trump’s attorneys, cracked up at that exchange, later placing his hand over his face and shaking his head side to side. “But he can’t say they’re a liar,” Millet added.

The departure of Christina Collins comes amid a lawsuit over major changes made to the board by state lawmakers and after the board itself passed a controversial resolution that she opposed. Collins was elected to the board in 2021. Her school board district was redrawn after she was elected to a four-year term. Christina Collins, Ohio State Board of Education member speaks during a December 2022 meeting. [Ohiochannel]Collins joined the other Democratic-leaning members of the board to oppose a provision of the new budget that eliminated the Ohio Department of Education, replacing it with the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce. That law, which took effect in October, also transferred power over curriculum and academic standards away from the 19-member board, 11 of whom are elected. Those powers were moved to DEW, which is headed by a new cabinet-level director. Steve Dackin, who was the state school superintendent for 11 days last year before resigning over ethics concerns about inside information he had before getting that job, was appointed to that position last month. “The change with the board in the mid-biennium budget, I mean, that’s a huge change to the board’s role. I believe the board is a constitutional body and I believe it should have retained the duties that it has,” Collins said, adding that she’ll stay on the suit as a parent affected by the change. Earlier this year, the board passed a resolution against a federal rule that requires schools to investigate claims of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity or risk losing their school breakfast and lunch funding. Collins opposed that resolution, which angered LGBTQ advocates and caused consternation on the board for months. Collins said her decision to step down from the board isn’t based on any of those things. She said having a baby in November ultimately led to her decision: “I truly need to be a little more protective of my time.” Collins’ resignation is effective at the end of this year. She won’t say what her next chapter brings but she hints she will continue to work with educational policy. Collins ran for the House last year in a heavily Republican district, losing to incumbent Rep. Sharon Ray (R-Medina).'}]"

According to Cleveland police, the woman struck a parked car in the 3700 block of W. 130th Street around 9 p.m. This is in the city’s Jefferson neighborhood. After the crash, the woman exited her vehicle and was struck by another vehicle. A neighbor who asked not to be identified told 19 News, “The people in that corner home asked her if she was okay. She was conscious and she told them she was alright. They went back into the house, and they said they heard another commotion, when they came back outside, she was lying down on the ground, and she was dead already.” EMS pronounced the woman wearing a Merry Christmas sweater dead at the scene. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner identified her as Cassandra Fear. Fear owned Fear’s Confections in Lakewood and 19 News interviewed Fear in April 2020 regarding candy stores getting ready for Easter during a pandemic. Her store closed in March after 13 years in business. Neighbors who live on the stretch of West 130th near Cooley and North say drivers who often travel more than twice the 35-mile-per-hour speed limit have made it dangerous for anyone who lives, travels, or walks in the area. Luke Eusebgio, who lives on West 130th between North Road and Interstate 71, says motorists cut through on the street to get to the interstate and put anyone in their path in serious danger. “In my short time at that residence, my car was parked legally on the side of the street in front of my house. It was rear-ended and totaled overnight by a passing driver who was going too fast. My housemate’s vehicle was parked on the other side of the street, legally parked and it was also slammed into from the back and was totaled completely as well. It’s a residential street, a bunch of homes, you don’t just want traffic flying up and down that street at times going 50 or 60 miles per hour,” said Eusebgio. Neighbor Latasha Harris believes a number of things could help, “I mean lowering the speed limit possibly I would say.” Other neighbors suggested a stop sign at the intersection of W. 130th and North. Cleveland police said the deadly accident remains under investigation and there are no arrests at this time. Copyright 2023 WOIO. All rights reserved.'}]"
