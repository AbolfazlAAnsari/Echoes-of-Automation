often too small for the eye to see. They\'re created as plastic degrades. And they\'re everywhere. They\'re in oceans, thanks to plastic garbage. They\'re in fish. They find their way into the water we drink in various ways, from surface runoff and wastewater effluent to particles deposited from the atmosphere. And they\'re released in huge quantities from plastic baby bottles when they\'re used to prepare formula according to standard guidelines, a new study in the journal Nature Food finds. The study suggests that bottle-fed infants around the world may be consuming more than 1.5 million particles of microplastics per day on average. But the researchers caution that parents should not be alarmed by the findings. That\'s because we still don\'t have enough evidence of health risks posed by microplastic consumptions by infants or adults. For example, last year, the World Health Organizationreleased a report saying that there\'s not enough evidence to conclude that microplastics in drinking water pose a risk to human health, though it said more research is needed to draw firmer conclusions. ""At the moment, there is no need to be afraid,"" said Philipp Schwabl, a physician and researcher at the Medical University of Vienna who authored a study thatfound microplastics in human excrement. ""But it is an open question and definitely an unmet [research] need."" ""The last thing we want to do is unduly alarm parents,"" saidJohn Boland, a professor of chemistry and materials science researcher at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland and one of the authors of the Nature Foodstudy. Boland said he and his co-authors decided to look at microplastics released by plastic baby bottles in part because there are a small number of products on the market. Worldwide, baby bottles made of polypropylene represent about 82% of the market, he said, and a small number of manufacturers dominate sales. That made it easier to get a ""comprehensive view of the market, and that also allowed us to actually look at the global potential of this issue,"" he says. The researchers selected 10 types of plastic baby bottles, representative of nearly 70% of the global market, and measured the levels of microplastics released when they were used to prepare infant formula accordingto guidelines set by WHO. Those guidelines call for mixing powdered formula with water heated to at least 158 degrees Fahrenheit to reduce bacteria loads. What they found was that the release of microplastics was highly temperature sensitive, Boland said. ""What\'s happening is that there\'s an interaction between the [plastic] polymer and the water,"" Boland said. ""It\'s almost like a flaking of the surface of the actual plastic itself."" Hotter water exacerbates that flaking, and so does shaking the bottle. When the researchers filled the plastic baby bottles with room temperature water and shook them for about 60 seconds, to simulate normal formula preparations, ""you get hundreds of thousands of microplastics,"" he said. When they increased that temperature to 158 F, the bottles released anywhere from 1 million to 16 million particles per liter. The bottles also released trillions of even smaller nanoplastics — tiny bits of plastic ranging in size from 10 nanometers up to 1 micron – so many that ""we stopped counting them,"" he said. The plastic bottles continued to release microplastic particles over 21 days of testing. The researchers then used global sales data for plastic baby bottles and information on national breastfeeding rates to estimate the potential exposure to microplastics for infants around the world in the first 12 months of life. Overall, they estimated that the average infant consumes more than 1.5 million microplastics particles per day. But those estimates varied drastically depending on the region of the world. Infants in higher-income parts of the world, including North America and Europe, where breastfeeding rates are lower, could potentially be consuming well over 2 million microplastic particles per day, they estimated. Meanwhile, in China, where glass baby bottles are more popular, the average infant\'s consumption of microplastics is estimated to be in the ""tens of thousands"" of particles, Boland said. Infants and Asia and Africa had the lowest potential exposure, they estimated. While the health effects of microplastics are still unknown, parents can significantly reduce their infants\' exposure by adding some steps to their bottle preparation routine, Boland said. He recommends letting plastic bottles cool completely after sterilization in hot water, then rinsing them out at least three times with water that\'s been allowed to cool to room temperature after being sterilized by boiling. (Make sure to boil it in glass or stainless steel, the researchers advise.) If using powdered formula, prepare it with 158 F water in a glass container, then let it cool to room temperature before transferring it to a plastic baby bottle for feeding. And whether preparing formula or warming breast milk, never use the microwave to heat it up, Boland said, because that can create ""pockets of really superheated water adjacent to the plastic, and that gives rise to copious quantities of microplastics."" While the levels of microplastics detected by the new Nature Food study are quite high, they are in line with levels reported by a2019 study that found that plastic tea bags – the kind often found in pyramid-shaped bags – can release billions of plastic microparticles when steeped in hot water, noted Schwabl, who wrote acommentary in Nature Food on the findings from Boland and his colleagues. That further suggests temperature is an important factor in influencing microplastics release, Schwabl said. Researchers from Trinity College Dublin also found that plastic tea kettles, plastic instant noodle cups and plastic food storage containers all released similarly high levels of microplastics when subjected to heat. Schwabl said that points to a need for more research into microplastics released from plastic food storage containers, especially when they are subjected to higher temperatures. As for what those microplastics may be doing in our bodies, the evidence so far is quite limited and unclear, Schwabl said. He noted someresearch has found microplastics can cause inflammation in rodents and accumulate in their guts and other organs, while other studies ""show they do not harm."" ""The threshold at which they cause problems has not been determined for humans,"" Schwabl said.

NPR\'s Lulu Garcia-Navarro spoke to Kandace Springs about the long-ruminating idea, the importance of Billie Holiday\'s ""Strange Fruit,"" and running into Norah Jones in the bathroom at the Nashville airport. Listen to the radio version at the audio link above and read on for highlights of the interview. On her long-standing desire to record a tribute to her heroes My dad was playing me Nina Simone since I was eight years old, and then he gave me a Norah Jones record, and then he gave me a Roberta Flack record and I took some classes through my teens into — now I\'m 31. Over time I\'ve grown listening to these artists and learning their tone and texture and the way they interpret songs. I just love the way they write stuff and sing; it just has moved me over the years. Most of them play and were really, really strong characters as well, so I\'ve learned a lot from them. It\'s a tribute record to give back to what they\'ve inspired me to do as an artist. On how a chance encounter with Norah Jones led to a collaboration honoring Ella Fitzgerald It was really cool meeting up with Norah. I ran into her at the bathroom, of all places, in the Nashville airport. She had done something else, and I was coming back from doing the Winter Jazz Fest in New York, and we just met there coming out of the [bathroom]. We exchanged numbers, and I texted her a little bit later and she was like ""Absolutely, I would love to be on your record."" We\'ve kind of known each other for the last six, seven years since I signed with Blue Note, but just never really gotten close like that, so it\'s really nice. And she invited me over to her apartment and we sat down at her little upright piano and picked out songs. We were playing everything from like ""Lush Life"" and ""Sophisticated Lady"" and all these awesome songs that Ella did and we landed on ""Angel Eyes."" It was one of the happiest moments of my life. I remember listening to her when I was like 12 or 13 years old and hearing her on the radio, and my dad would always joke ""That girl stole your gig,"" because she plays piano and sings. I really looked up to her, and to actually sit less than 10 feet from her — she was on a beautiful Steinway and I sat down at a little vintage Wurlitzer, a 140B model. And we both played and took turns doing the verse lines and started harmonizing at the end. It\'s just a moment I\'ll never forget. And her skill is just impeccable. On getting mentored by Prince I just posted a video, this is in 2014, of me doing a cover of Sam Smith\'s ""Stay With Me."" You know, that song was a big thing at that time. And I put it on YouTube and then another blog company retweeted it for us, just to help. And apparently Prince saw it and he retweeted it and then he called my record label. Before I know it, literally four days later, I\'m at Paisley Park with him there, with New Power Generation Quartet and Third Eye Girl all in the same room. It was amazing, it\'s something I\'ll never forget. The thing he would always say is to not cover up my voice too much and stick with live instruments and production like that. And I agree with him. My dad would always say the same thing as well, so I respect that a lot. On covering Billie Holiday\'s ""Strange Fruit"" I always describe the song as beautiful and yet it\'s ugly; it\'s bittersweet when you listen to it and the lyrics. It\'s a time in history that people should be aware of, and just think about Billie Holiday in the \'30s when she came out and sang it, what she would have been going through at that time. It took a lot of bravery. But the song is a timeless song. I think the younger generation should be aware of it and hear it. One fascinating story about Billie: When she would sing it, she would tell her audience not to applaud after she performed that song. And after the last note rang, they would turn the lights off and she would leave the stage. And when they turned the lights back on there would be no one there, just to kind of leave an impact.
