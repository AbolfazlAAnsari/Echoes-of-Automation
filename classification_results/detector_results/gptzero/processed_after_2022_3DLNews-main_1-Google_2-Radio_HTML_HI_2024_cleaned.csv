February 16, 2024 at 5:02 PM ET A New York judge has ordered former President Donald Trump and executives at the Trump Organization to pay over $364 million in a civil fraud case, handing a win to New

The Friday decision from Judge Arthur Engoron orders Trump and his flagship organization to pay the bulk of that amount: almost $355 million. Trump\'s two sons and co-defendants, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., are each liable for $4 million. Allen Weisselberg, a former Trump Organization executive, is liable for $1 million. The total is even higher with interest — more than $450 million overall, according to the attorney general\'s office. ""Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological.

The judge also decided to limit Trump and his co-defendants\' ability to do business in the Empire State. Trump and his companies are prohibited from serving as an officer or director of any New York business or applying for loans for three years. His sons are limited from similar leadership roles for two years. Jeffrey McConney, ex-controller of the Trump Organization and also a defendant, was not ordered to pay any amount, but he and Weisselberg are permanently barred from serving in the financial control function of any New York corporation or similar business entity registered or licensed in New York state.

Engoron had already determined that there was fraud and that the former president, his sons and other executives were liable. Throughout the trial, legal teams argued whether the value of notable Trump properties, such as Manhattan\'s Trump Tower and 40 Wall Street, were inflated deliberately.
