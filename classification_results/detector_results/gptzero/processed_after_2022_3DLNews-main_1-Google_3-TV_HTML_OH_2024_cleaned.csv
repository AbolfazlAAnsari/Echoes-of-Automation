An order by Judge Tanya Chutkan says the court will set a ""new schedule if and when the mandate is returned."" The case is being held up as Trump argues he should not have been charged, claiming he is entitled to presidential immunity. The immunity argument is currently being considered by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Arguments in front of the three-judge panel were heard in January. The judges expressed skepticism that Trump was immune from prosecution. However, it\'s unclear when the ruling will be announced. No matter the decision, the ruling could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to expedite a hearing on the issue. A lower court already ruled that Trump was not immune from prosecution. Trump, the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, has pleaded not guilty to four counts, including conspiracy charges and obstructing or impeding the certification of the electoral vote. If Trump were to be elected president again, he would appoint the person overseeing the Justice Department, which brought this case. Trump is currently facing 91 charges in several states for his actions during and after his presidency.

The Protecting Students on Campus Act would give students more information about the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in the Department of Education and their right to file a civil rights complaint if they are discriminated against on campus based on their gender or race. The bill was introduced by Democratic Pennsylvania Sens. Bob Casey and John Fetterman, along with Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.). “Diversity is our strength as a country. No student should face hostility or violence for who they are, what they look like, where they’re from, or what they believe,” Fetterman said in a statement. “Amid a despicable rise in antisemitism and Islamophobia in our country, I am proud to introduce this bill with my colleagues to empower students facing discrimination to take action and hold universities accountable in protecting students.” The bill would require colleges to post a link to the OCR’s website on their main homepage and post materials around campus on how to file a complaint. The OCR would also have to tell Congress on a monthly basis how many complaints were filed, how long complaints have taken to get addressed and plans to address the complaints. OCR would not be able to close a complaint based on other investigations besides their own and the Education Department inspector general would have to investigate schools that get higher numbers of complaints. “No student should be harassed or attacked at school just because of who they are,” said Cassidy. “This legislation holds colleges and universities accountable and ensures discrimination against students is never ignored.” The legislation comes after a spike in antisemitism and Islamophobia on campus since the war between Israel and Hamas began in early October.

Kramer, the co-founder of the protopunk Detroit band the MC5 that thrashed out such hardcore anthems as “Kick Out the Jams” and influenced everyone from the Clash to Rage Against the Machine, has died at age 75. Kramer died Friday at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, according to Jason Heath, a close friend and executive director of Kramer’s nonprofit Jail Guitar Doors USA. Heath said the cause of death was pancreatic cancer. From the late 1960s to early 1970s, no band was closer to the revolutionary spirit of the time than the MC5, which featured Kramer and Fred “Sonic” Smith on guitars, Rob Tyner on vocals, Michael Davis on bass and Dennis “Machine Gun” Thompson on drums. Managed for a time by White Panther co-founder John Sinclair, they were known for their raw, uncompromising music, which they envisioned as the soundtrack for the uprising to come. “Brother Wayne Kramer was the best man I’ve ever known,” Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello wrote on Instagram Friday. “He possessed a one of a kind mixture of deep wisdom & profound compassion, beautiful empathy and tenacious conviction. His band the MC5 basically invented punk rock music.” The band had little commercial success and its core lineup did not last beyond the early 1970s, but its legacy endured, both for its sound and for its fusing of music to political action. Kramer, who had a long history of legal battles and substance abuse, would tell his story in the 2018 memoir “The Hard Stuff: Dope, Crime, the MC5, and My Life of Impossibilities.” Morello is among the musicians appearing on a new MC5 album, “Heavy Lifting,” which comes out this spring and includes Kramer and Thompson from the original group. Slash, Vernon Reid and William DuVall of Alice in Chains also contributed. “Pushing music forward, carrying a message of self-efficacy and empowerment — and just to have fun,” Kramer told Mojo magazine in December. “It’s all in the MC5. Creativity is the solution for the challenges we face.” Thompson is now the band’s only surviving member. Kramer and Smith had known each other since their teens and played with various other musicians around Detroit before the core lineup was in place, in the mid-1960s. At Tyner’s suggestions, they called themselves the MC5, short for Motor City Five, and emulated the Rolling Stones, the Who, and other hard rock bands of the era. By 1968, they had built a substantial local following and were influenced by Marxism, the White Panthers, the Beats and other social-political movements. The MC5 was more radical politically than most of its peers, and otherwise louder and more daring. They were virtually the only band to perform during the infamous 1968 Democratic National Convention, in Chicago, where police were beating up anti-war protesters. “Kick Out the Jams” was their most famous song, and opened with an unprintable call to arms: “Kick out the jams motherf--——-!” A live album of the same name reached the top 40 in 1969, their highest-charting release. They also released the studio albums “Back in the USA” and “High Time” before breaking up at the end of 1972. Kramer would lead various incarnations of the MC5 over the following decades, and perform with Was (Not Was) among other groups. But for a time he sank into the life of what he called “a small-time Detroit criminal.” He was arrested on drug charges in 1975 and sentenced to four years in prison. Jail Guitar Doors, which provides inmates with musical instruments, is named for a Clash song that refers to his struggles: “Let me tell you ‘bout Wayne and his deals of cocaine.” Survivors include his wife, Margaret Saadi, and son, Francis.
