A student-led daily news production called the Mully News took flight at the Muldown Elementary School this month. Students record a video for the news show featuring the Pledge of Allegiance, weather report, what’s on the lunch menu for the day, along with other fun news or happenings going on throughout the school. The program was most needed by certain students who were having a hard time finding a sense of purpose at school, according to Muldown behavior specialist Mandy Dobbs, and there’s been a positive shift across the entire school since it began. Along with the help of Muldown’s technology integration specialist Kate Preston, Dobbs and a core group of students implemented the new program. The Mully News has a core group of five students that produce the news everyday, but many other kids across all grades of the school are wanting to get involved as well — so many that Dobbs says kids are filling out applications and there is a list of students just waiting for their opportunity to be on the news. “Different kids get to come in and either read a poem or get to come be a news anchor,” she said. “Now that we have our core group we’re just kind of making it bigger and letting other kids have that opportunity to be on the news and feel that sense of purpose and the culture that we have in there, so it’s pretty cool.” Students record the news program every afternoon and then it is uploaded to the school’s website so students, staff and parents can all access it. It is shown in all the classrooms in the morning each day on large smartboards. Third-grader Hudson Clark, who helped found the program with Dobbs, is the main news reporter and often interviews people within the school for special reports to be included in the morning news. The Mully News also replaces morning announcements that used to be read by a student over the loudspeakers in the school, but had to be eliminated due to COVID-19 safety precautions. “Kids are wanting to be a part of it,” Dobbs said. “Teachers are coming and saying, hey my kids turned in applications when is it their turn — they’re just wanting to be a part of it.” Dobbs noted that all grades are getting involved in the schoolwide program. For the kindergarten and first graders who can’t yet read as well as the older students, they can lead the school in the pledge or recite other small news items. And the group has plans to keep expanding the news program to include more in depth reports — these reports could double as a piece for the news and also be a part of their academic learning. In addition, staff and students across the school are giving their own ideas on what to include in the Mully News. “We’re just slowly adding more things in there; teachers have been coming up to us and giving us ideas what they’re thinking or what their kids are talking about — so it kind of feels like a whole schoolwide thing right now,” Dobbs said. The group had to learn the technology associated with producing the program. The school ordered a green screen and the students record the news in front of it everyday with an application on a tablet. They use a laptop with the script typed on it to use as a teleprompter, but in the future they are looking into more advanced technology to show the script. Dobbs helps come up with some of the ideas and types up the script for now, but in the future she wants it to be solely in the hands of the students. “The point of it is so that it will be completely student run, so most of it is student run at this time,” she said. Since the group first began recording the news at the end of March there’s been noticeable changes in the students involved as they’ve found purpose and have pride in doing a specific job daily, Dobbs notes. “They just really needed something to help drive them in wanting to come to school and wanting to try hard,” Dobbs explained. She said the program also gives students a break in their class schedule and engages them in a way of learning and opportunity to learn that’s not necessarily academically focused. “It’s increasing their responsibility as students; students kind of need that just to feel that purpose and that meaningfulness,” she said.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:33 pm Acantha photo by Nancy Thornton The Brady Methodist Church in Brady is 100 years old this year. A shared celebration is planned with the Dutton Methodist Church on April 10 and 11. When Dutton mom Kelbe Blanchet had her first child, Kadence Mary, she wanted her baptized in the same church where she and her mother, Kathy “Bitsi” Wells, before her were baptized, the United Methodist Church in Brady. It was an important decision, she said, one that her husband, Cody, understood was based on the strong sentiments she holds for her family’s church, that along with the United Methodist Church in Dutton, will celebrate their 100th anniversaries this weekend. The Blanchets was married in the Dutton Methodist Church. Kadence was baptized last Nov. 29 when she was about 18 months old and her baby brother, Daniel, now 2 months old, will have his baptism there at a future date, she said. Kelbe Blanchet said her family on both sides, the Kauks and the Weikums, have attended the church in Brady for many years. But, like most small rural towns in Montana that have stopped growing, Brady has more elderly people than young ones now. “In Brady, not a lot of community is left. I went to school in Dutton so both places have meaning, but Brady now has a lot of elderly people. It’s sad to see towns dying. The church helps people to come together. It’s great that they continue worshiping there,” she said. Both churches in the Brady and Dutton communities will celebrate their 100th anniversary on April 10 and April 11. Dutton events on April 10 from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. include a sing-along, time for sharing stories and recognition of longtime members, previous pastors and district superintendents. Brady events on April 10 from 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. include a sing-along with storytelling and recognition of longtime members, descendants of charter members, previous pastors and district superintendents. Cake and coffee will follow. United Methodist Bishop Elaine Stanovsky will make a presentation at both events. On April 11, each congregation will worship at their regular times, 9:15 a.m. in Brady, and 11 a.m. in Dutton. A joint potluck dinner will begin about 12:30 p.m. in Dutton. The public is invited to all events. The Rev. Alice Ebi Kestler, the pastor at both churches since 1998, will join in the celebration. “I really like the pastor,” Kelbe Blanchet said. Kelbe’s grandparents, Harvey and Joan Weikum, were married in the Brady church in 1973, and raised two daughters while farming and ranching in the Brady area. Joan Weikum, who is the church treasurer, said the Brady congregation has 57 members. Commemorative pictures were taken a few months ago. Joan Weikum owns Fred’s Insurance in Brady and is the treasurer for the Brady County Water and Sewer District. In an interview last fall, she was pragmatic about the continued survival of the town and the church she loves. “We used to have Sunday School,” she said, but as fewer young people became the norm, a Tuesday school was opened serving the grades 7-12 youth group. “But that’s gone now, with no school in town,” Weikum said. “We had a women’s group and friendship circles; we did a lot of things,” she said. The history of Brady was published in 1999 and it tells the story of the churches in Brady. Weikum said the community has Mildred Trost to thank for maintaining a Methodist church scrapbook with clippings from 1910 to 1985. Weikum said Brady was a thriving community in its hayday. Then “the banks went broke in 1930s, and two to three hotels burned down. We used to have three elevators, now there’s only one,” she said. She bought the insurance business in 1988 from Fred Froebel who also owned a now-closed supermarket in town. The church was not big enough for the Weikum’s marriage ceremony in 1973, she said, adding that it’s too small for most funerals, too, but that hasn’t prevented the congregation from maintaining the picturesque structure. The church pews seat only so many, she said, but the old Sunday school room can seat 130 to 150 people. “We used to have big choirs, as many as 100 people,” she said. “My kids moved away and everybody in church is in their later 40s and 50s. Very few of the young stay, but the church is still alive,” she said. She recalled the big Christmas programs with 80 children, when the now closed high school had 100 students. “We had lots of little ones. It was quite a pageant. We used to have a birthday cake for Jesus with one candle. Then cake and goodies in the basement,” she said. The church history is included in “On the Track of History: Brady, Montana, During the 20th Century, 1909-1999.” Copies are available for purchase from Janice Farkell, Brady, MT 59416. The purchase price is $40, plus $5 for postage.

Stacks of cadaver trays and rolling racks fill a yard at Acela Truck Co. in Belgrade on Thursday, August 13, 2020. Funeral director Kevin Spitzer has been overwhelmed with COVID-related deaths in the small city of Aberdeen, South Dakota. He and his two colleagues at the Spitzer-Miller Funeral Home are working 12-15 hours a day, seven days a week, to keep up with the demand in the community of 26,000. The funerals are sparsely attended, which would have been unthinkable before the pandemic. “We had a funeral for a younger man one recent Saturday, and not 20 people came, because most everyone was just afraid,” he said. As COVID-19 has spread from big cities to rural communities, it has stressed not only hospitals, but also what some euphemistically call “last responders.” The crush has overwhelmed morgues, funeral homes and religious leaders, required ingenuity and even changed the rituals of honoring the dead. Officials in many smaller cities and towns learned from seeing the overflow of bodies during this spring’s first wave of COVID-19 deaths in places such as Detroit, where nurses at Detroit Medical Center Sinai-Grace Hospital alerted the media to bodies accumulating in hospital storage rooms. They watched as New York hospitals and funeral homes marshaled refrigerated trucks to store bodies. More than 600 bodies of people who died in the spring COVID-19 surge remain in freezer trucks on the Brooklyn waterfront because officials can’t find next of kin, or relatives are also sick or unable to pay for burial. People like Dr. Robert Kurtzman, Montana’s chief medical examiner, took heed. Last spring, he worked with funeral directors and others to study the state’s morgue capacity. After looking at COVID-19 projections, the state arranged with the Montana National Guard to have 13 refrigerated semi trucks ready to dispatch anywhere in the state. “We are already in a precarious position, and the projections present a scary proposition,” he said. “We need to be ready for worst-case scenarios.” Chad Towner, CEO of St. Joseph Health System, which has two hospitals in northern Indiana, ordered two refrigerated semitrailers in April. For a time, things were relatively quiet. But the pandemic has hit. “I told a friend who was a COVID-19 doubter that if my wife needed a bed today, I could not arrange one. That’s the dire situation we face here,” Towner said. “All our competitors in the area are in the same boat, and we’re working together instead of competing.” Although the freezer trucks have not yet been needed, he worries that the sharp increase in cases, and those anticipated from Thanksgiving travel and gatherings, will make last-resort measures necessary. “We recently had four deaths in one afternoon,” said Towner. “A priest approached me to say he’d been asked to provide last rites to three patients in one hour.” Moving bodies from the hospital morgue is a slower process than usual, he said. “Morticians and funeral homes are overflowing as well. Families that are sick or quarantined at the time of the loved one’s death often can’t work with us on a transfer, meaning bodies are here longer. The entire system is stressed to the tipping point,” said Towner. Private enterprise has created a solution for smaller communities. In Bozeman, a specialty truck company is retrofitting trailers that can be pulled by an SUV or a pickup. Acela Truck Co. has already sold hundreds of the pull-behind refrigerated units created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. They range from 9 to 53 feet and have racks that each hold four body trays. “We’re very busy and have orders in all of the lower 48 states,” said CEO David Ronsen. Acela has partnered with Mopec, a Wisconsin autopsy supply company, to help sell and deliver the new product. Billings Clinic also anticipated a flood of deaths last spring by reserving a semitrailer for delivery, if needed. The clinic, which has just two morgue spaces, has dealt with at least 80 COVID-19 deaths, including seven on the weekend after Thanksgiving. Chief Nursing Officer Laurie Smith said the hospital is at capacity, despite adding beds by converting office space and building an addition. The hospital, which currently has 335 beds, so far has handled the additional deaths through what she calls a “sad partnership” with funeral homes, which have been quickly picking up bodies the hospital cannot store. The hospital does its best to allow relatives to say goodbye, but that often involves family members standing at an interior window outside the patient’s room, using a computer tablet to communicate their last words. That is just one way in which the rituals of grieving have changed during COVID-19. Typical congregational hymns are pretty much gone, as are choirs. “We are using mostly recordings, sometimes a soloist,” said Spitzer. Funeral home directors who pride themselves on spending time comforting grieving families say they are so busy that some days they have to rush out from one funeral to begin the next one. “Families are being robbed of the whole funeral rite experience and losing the support of having friends and family around them,” said Shauna Kjos-Miotke of Fiksdal Funeral Home in Webster, South Dakota. Native communities have not only been among the hardest hit with COVID-19 illnesses and deaths, but their grieving rituals have been among the most seriously disrupted. “Normally a funeral is a two- or three-day process with hundreds of people,” said Josiah Hugs, a Crow tribal member who is the outreach coordinator for Billings Urban Indian Health and Wellness Center. “Now there is no time to tell stories about the person, not a lot of singing and praying.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:26 pm During any given election cycle, campaign ads with gun-toting politicians donning hunting vests and poised to shoot a target out of frame bombard every television viewer in Montana. Unlike in most states, Montanans can’t assume these politicians have an “R” by their name when they get to the ballot box. According to the World Population Review, two-thirds of Montanans own at least one firearm, making it the state with the highest gun ownership rate in the nation. Guns manifest in the political culture with House Bill 102, which would allow for concealed carry of firearms without a permit on college campuses. It is one of the most right-leaning, deregulatory pieces of legislation to come out of the past legislative session, and passed on party lines before being temporarily halted by a judge in a lawsuit between the Board of Regents and the attorney general. Despite blocks in the courts, HB 102 passed its readings and votes quickly, partially due to cohesive lobbying efforts in support of it and a lack of pro-gun control legislators. “The anti-gun side of this debate in Montana has no contenders. They have no traction,” Gary Marbut, president of the Montana Shooting Sports Association (MSSA), said. “We’ve had many bills with popular support over the years, but until 2020, we had Steve Bullock vetoing many of them despite their majority support in the legislature. That’s not the case anymore.” Gun politics are, in short, Marbut’s bread and butter. He is the head of the largest gun rights interest group in the state, the author of multiple books on gun politics. He claims he authored much of the pro-gun legislation of the past few decades, including HB 102. His organization, MSSA, has seen 70 of its legislative initiatives passed and enacted into law, with many others falling victim to former Governor Steve Bullock’s veto pen, as well as Brian Schweitzer’s, his Democratic predecessor. The Democratic party’s 16-year reign on the Montana governorship ended in 2020, and Republicans and pro-gun advocates are pleased with their leverage in the legislature. “This was our first unified Republican government in 16 years and our legislators rightly took advantage of that,” the UM College Republicans stated in an email. Marbut and the UM College Republicans agreed that after the 2020 election, the left and gun control advocates have no significant voice or place in gun politics in Montana anymore, with Marbut even stating that MSSA has not needed to spend a lot of its resources in lieu of the shifted political climate. “We have chosen not to spend money in the last couple of election cycles because it has not been necessary. Montana voters no longer want to elect people who are anti-gun,” Marbut said. “We can spend our money more effectively than the candidates can anyways.” Despite the relaxation of several gun control provisions passed under Democratic governorships in past legislative sessions, multiple smaller committees and government bodies resolved to oppose HB 102. The Associated Students of the University of Montana voted almost unanimously in its resolution to oppose the bill in a 22-1 vote count. “ASUM has taken the position that HB 102 is not a well-informed policy, and it is not the right way to ensure safety on our campus,” ASUM President Noah Durnell said. “The bill could foster a culture on campus that could make students feel unsafe and even have unthinkable, destructive outcomes.” Moms Demand Action and Helena Youth Against Gun Violence (HYAGV), activist groups that advocate for more restrictions on gun access and ownership, are concerned for their future roles in gun legislation negotiations. Clara McRae, a UM student, co-founder of HYAGV and organizer of the Helena March For Our Lives, felt troubled by recent political culture developments in both the state and nationwide. “There has been a recent hardcore ideological shift in the past five years to the right, and interest groups are capitalizing on it to spread rhetorical arguments and generally find ways to deregulate all levels of government,” McRae said. It’s been three years since the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida that sparked a national student movement for sweeping gun control reforms. McRae said she is not satisfied with the results of their efforts and is losing faith in the room for gun control expansion under the current government electoral system. “Since the March For Our Lives, nothing has really changed for the better, and some things have changed for the worse, especially over the past legislative session,” McRae said. “[Student activists] should just continue what we’re doing, but we might need even larger reforms before we have a chance to turn the tides.” Moms Demand Action, a pro-gun control lobbying group that emerged in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, continued its advocacy through the last legislative session. Volunteers with the Montana chapter see the gun policy situation as regressive and damaging to their past advocacy and legislation efforts. “In Montana, we had pretty good common sense gun laws up until this legislative session. I’ll say that we definitely lost a lot of ground and our voices were not heard during the legislative session, but we are still here and working,” Sherri Sprigg, a volunteer with the Montana chapter of Moms Demand Action, said. “Moms Demand Action is not an anti-gun group. We just promote common sense and safe gun legislation, which a lot of voters do not understand.” Sprigg also recognized the ideological shift that McRae noted, yet the UM College Republicans asserted that although gun control advocates do not have a lot of traction in Montana, they still have an advantage in the media and public gun rights messaging. “We feel many students are ill-informed, both about gun rights generally and HB 102 specifically, because they’ve been misinformed by the media and anti-gun individuals,” the UM College Republicans said. “If students were more informed about the gun purchasing process and why we have a right to bear arms, they would be more in support of HB 102.” Marbut said Gov. Greg Gianforte wanted HB 102 to be the first bill on his desk to sign, so supporters for the bill in the legislature hurried it through all the readings and votes. Gun control advocates claimed this was a deliberate strategy on behalf of the bill sponsors and gun rights interest groups to limit the opportunity for opposing voices to be heard. “National and statewide interest groups have a huge role in gun politics in Montana, which is a huge reason why HB 102 got passed so efficiently,” Durnell of ASUM said. “The bill went through the legislature very fast, which was intentional to avoid massive public backlash on behalf of the sponsors.” Activists against HB 102 are concerned with the culture the bill could create on college campuses, as well as the possibility of an increased rate of suicide by firearm with greater gun availability. “HB 102 could definitely have dangerous consequences on college campuses, and it is not supported by any evidence,” McRae said. “Lax gun restrictions on college campuses have had mixed results, but it sets a bad cultural precedent that could make students feel unsafe.” “We are mostly concerned with the enabling of more firearm suicides, but there is no evidence that introducing more guns into a space would prevent any mass shootings,” Sprigg said. “By allowing for wide access to guns in public spaces like HB 102, we could see increased suicide rates among students, who have already dealt with a lot mentally with COVID-19.” In contrast, advocates for HB 102 question gun-free zones and champion the ability for people to possess guns as a means of defense. “HB 102 would eliminate dangerous gun-free zones where, statistically, mostly criminals possess guns,” Marbut said.

MMA fighter Chad Stephens, left, poses with Brandon Olsen. Olsen has been training the young MMA fighter for the past four years. Stephens won his first pay-per-view match in 43 seconds. Chad Stephens came to Hamilton looking to learn how to fight. He found his mentor there. On this morning almost four years later, the 24-year-old from Jamaica sits quietly along the edge of the mats of the Olsen-Behring MMA dojo amongst the piercing sound of steel against concrete. Workers are busy installing the wood strips that will hold the mats in place while Stephens’ mixed martial arts professor, Brandon Olsen, puts actor Luke Grimes — aka Yellowstone’s Kaycee Dutton — through the paces. It’s not quite been a month since Stephens won his first pay-per-view mixed martial arts match in Kalispell in 43 seconds with a move called the lion killer choke. He’s anxious for his next opportunity to prove that he belongs in that world. Life has never been easy for Stephens. “My dad passed away when I was young,” Stephens said. “I looked up to him. Ever since then, each fight I win, it is for him. When I lose, it feels like I lose him more. I can’t afford that because I’ve lost enough in my life already.” Olsen is a former mixed martial arts fighter who spent years traveling the country fighting in cage matches for pay-for-view bouts. He began his journey into the sport as a wrestler at Corvallis High School. He returned to the Bitterroot Valley to share his knowledge with others. Today, Olsen works with children as young as 3 and seniors into their 80s at his dojo in Hamilton. His team of youngsters regularly come home with gold and silver medals from tournaments around the state. “There is something in this sport for everyone,” Olsen said. “I’ve trained people in wheelchairs. I’ve trained people who have had strokes. I train kids with autism.” “There is stuff to teach anybody, regardless of their situation,” he said. “I have had kids who are really shy and introverted and they come out of class being outgoing and confident. I’ve seen people who have had strokes learn to move better and strengthen their bodies.” For others, martial arts provides an outlet for the challenges they've faced in life. “My grandma used to say that if you hit a dog long enough, it’s going to go crazy,” Stephens said. “I want to be able to let my hurt out in a way that’s safe. If someone beats me, it is what it is. I can show my sportsmanship with a hug after a match.” “If I wasn’t doing anything with fighting, I would probably lose myself,” Stephens said. “I would be at a gym working out, but it wouldn’t be enough. Making contact with someone else is what’s important for me.” Mixed Martial Arts is a sport that offers its practitioners a chance to display their training and work on their art, Olsen said. “We get to prove what we do works and that it’s effective in self-defense,” he said. “Before they had these competitions, it was really hard to know what worked in a fight and what didn’t. People were teaching all these things and nobody put them to the test.” “Martial arts has progressed in the United States more the last 30 years than it had in the last couple hundred,” he said. “All of these things that people did in ancient times when there was hand-to-hand combat had been lost to time.” “You look at the ancient Greek and Roman wall paintings and murals and they show some of the same moves that we use today,” Olsen said. “People had just forgotten about them.” Stephens doesn’t know when his next MMA match will be. He isn’t certain at this point whether his path will take him to the professional level. He’s working two jobs in Hamilton and trains whenever he has the time. When he can, Stephens helps Olsen work with the youngsters who learn jujitsu, kickboxing, boxing and wrestling. “I know that I continue to improve,” Stephens said. “I guarantee that I will. There’s always something to learn. There’s no limit to the techniques. No one can learn the whole thing.” Olsen smiles. “People are discovering new things every day,” he said. “The art is evolving every day. It’s an exciting time for mixed martial arts.” Subscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:39 pm Editor Dr. Anthony Fauci, a lead advisor on President Biden's Coronavirus Task Force, talks with Char-Koosta News about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and why tribal nations should get it when it is available. Key member of President Biden’s COVID-19 task force and Director of National Institute of Health Dr. Anthony Fauci talks to Char-Koosta News about the vaccine and the virus it’s meant to stop Char-Koosta News Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institute of Health (NIH) and a top adviser on President Biden’s COVID-19 task force, spoke with Char-Koosta News last week about the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines released by Pfizer and Moderna. Despite over 44 million vaccinations ‘going into arms’ since early December, skepticism of vaccine safety has discouraged many from rolling up their sleeves, despite the death toll from COVID-19 passing the half million mark. For many in the country, vaccine distrust comes from disinformation and a lack of understanding how vaccines are created. Government use of medicine has been used to experiment on minorities without their knowledge or permission. For tribal nations, the skepticism is also historical. Federal aid to tribes has either been minimal or non-existent; used to sterilize indigenous women; used to eradicate tribes; and more. This question came to Dr. Fauci’s attention at last week’s ‘fireside chat’ at the University of Montana's Mansfield Lecture series in Missoula where Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes Chairwoman Shelly Fyant asked him why Indigenous People’s should trust the federal government’s push to vaccinate everyone in the United States. Speaking to Char-Koosta News, Dr. Fauci expanded his answer to Fyant as to why Tribal Nation’s should get the COVID-19 vaccination. He acknowledged the Federal Government’s role in breaking the trust of minorities, saying, “There are reasons there is hesitancy on the part of minority communities, because if you’re African American or Native American or Hispanic, that the Federal Government in some cases has not really treated minority populations well.” Dr. Fauci says that to confront the skepticism, one must respect the skepticism and concerns, not criticize it, and to convey understanding of them. The first concern Dr. Fauci addressed is the speed in which the vaccine was developed and released to the public. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in January 2020 and eleven months later a vaccine was released. Skeptics voice concern that because of the expedited nature of developing, testing and releasing a vaccine in less than a year when most medicines take years for approval, there are major safety issues that may arise from the COVID-19 vaccine, such as debilitating side effects. Dr. Fauci assures the public that this was not the case. “That is really a reflection of the scientific advances that have been made over the previous decade or more. So, it isn’t cutting corners, it isn’t sacrificing safety, it’s not sacrificing scientific integrity. It is an example of what years of scientific investment can do.” Dr. Fauci described the process of creating the vaccine in a presentation to the National Indian Health Board in October 2020. In January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease COVID-19 was sequenced and shared with the scientific community. Learned from previous viral outbreaks such as those from the now-extinct SARS-COV-1 in 2002-2003 and the MERS outbreak in the Middle East in 2012-present, virologists and epidemiologists were able to identify the type of virus causing COVID-19. “The experience we had in the early phases of vaccine development for MERS was an important step toward getting a successful vaccine for COVID-19,” Dr. Fauci told CKN. Utilizing scientific breakthroughs, vaccine candidates were developed and went through three trial stages, culminating in human tests where results from participants from a wide variety of financial, ethnic and geographic backgrounds were collected and analyzed. Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) was a participant. Throughout the process, ethical standards are practiced. Both pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna submitted their results to independent science organizations for scrutiny before heading to the Federal Drug Administration for final analysis and Emergency Use Authorization. Other companies such as Astra-Zeneca and Johnson & Johnson are going through similar scrutiny with their vaccine candidates. To Char-Koosta News, Dr. Fauci said minority groups, who have been treated badly by the Government and believe the pharmaceutical companies are taking advantage of them, ask ‘How do they trust that the vaccine works, and is truly safe and effective?’ “Since then, ethical considerations, ethical programs, ethical constraints have been put into effect that make it impossible to have the kinds of really somewhat, if not frankly, unethical things that have been done,” he said. “That just can’t happen now under the guidelines we have, number one, and number two, the decisions of whether something is safe and effective is made by independent bodies who are not beholden to the Federal Government or to the companies. They’re beholden to the general public, including the Tribal Nations.” As part of President Biden’s COVID-19 Task Force, Dr. Fauci works closely with other entities including the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to not only develop strategies to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but to avoid disparity in treatments to minority groups. According to the CDC, Native Americans and Alaska Natives are 1.9 times more likely to be infected, 3.7 times more likely to be hospitalized and 2.4 times likely to die from COVID-19 than white persons. These rates are higher than African American persons. Got to Montana's COVID-19 dashboard to learn more. As of Tuesday, February 23, in Montana, American Indians or Alaska Natives made up 11 percent of the 99,040 COVID-19 cases and 17 percent of the 1,341 deaths. Indigenous people make up 6.7 percent of Montana’s population. In Lake County, 10 of the 27 COVID-19 related deaths were Native American. In his presentation to the NIHB, Dr. Fauci described the longstanding systemic health and social inequities driving the COVID-19 disparities: discrimination; limited healthcare access and use; occupation – disproportionately essential workers where remote work or physical distancing is impossible; education, income and wealth gaps; and housing, particularly in households that contain many people and generations, and communities where prevention strategies are difficult to follow. Compounding the infection rates are underlying health issues – comorbidities – in tribal communities such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity. COVID-19 infections severely affect persons with these comorbidities, often resulting in hospitalizations and sometime death. “We understand the disparities, we are trying to overcome them, and we are trying as best as possible to get equity in getting Tribal Nations to have access to the vaccines when they become available,” Dr. Fauci said to CKN. “President Biden has established an equity task force and he has put Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith as the Chairperson on that task force, which is really quite important.” Nunez-Smith is African American, and is an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Yale School of Medicine, where she is also Associate Dean for Health Equity Research and founding director of the Equity Research and Innovation Center. According to minorityhealth.hhs.gov, “The Task Force is part of the government-wide effort to identify and eliminate health and social disparities that result in disproportionately higher rates of exposure, illness, hospitalization and death related to COVID-19. The Task Force’s mission is to provide specific recommendations to the President of the United States for mitigating inequities caused or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and for preventing such inequities in the future.” Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett was instrumental in creating the mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines. CKN asked Dr. Fauci if encouraging minorities and young people to learn virology and epidemiological sciences to develop vaccines and therapeutics would help boost confidence. “Yeah, absolutely. I always encourage minority populations to get involved in science in general and certainly in medical sciences,” he said. “I mean there’s nothing better than having a member of your own group and community be involved in the science of what’s going on to generate trust in that science. A good example is one of the lead scientists to develop the mRNA vaccine is Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett. Dr. Corbett is an African American woman. When the African Americans see that one of their own is a major player in developing the vaccine, that generates a considerable about of confidence in them (vaccines).” A lack of confidence in vaccines, distrust in the scientific methods or processes, and even conspiracy theories surrounding vaccines have caused skeptics to declare that they won’t get it even if offered.

Contractors working for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took samples at Butte High School and an adjacent apartment building to establish whether a chemical contaminant plume in their vicinity poses a health risk. The shuttered Unique Cleaners at 345 S. Main St. is one suspected source. Contractors working for the EPA conducted indoor air quality sampling Oct. 30 at Butte High School to determine whether there was an immediate health threat linked to the potential presence of chemical vapors from a contaminated groundwater plume. In essence, the five samples suggested there was no such threat. Only one sampling unit, which was placed in an unoccupied crawl space with a dirt floor, showed a detectable level of solvents, the EPA said. The agency said “those results were well below the risk-based screening levels used for evaluation of potential immediate health concerns.” Ultimately, the EPA reported that “validated data received at this time indicates there is no immediate health concern.” Judy Jonart, superintendent of Butte School District No. 1, was briefed this week about the EPA’s testing results. She said Thursday that she was thrilled that the air quality sampling in October did not detect an immediate health threat. She noted that testing by the EPA’s contractor will continue. Joseph Chisholm, the EPA’s project lead for the site, said additional testing will include installing a small port in the structure’s slab. EPA said it also plans to test the air quality in an apartment building near the high school but hasn’t reached the building’s owner yet. A groundwater plume containing toxic chemicals commonly used in commercial dry cleaning is believed to lurk underneath a portion of Butte High School and the apartment building. The Montana Department of Environmental Quality first detected the solvent plume in 2009. The EPA contracted for a preliminary investigation of the site over a decade later — raising pointed questions about why the investigation was delayed for so long. The report was completed this past summer and shared with Butte-Silver Bow officials this fall. The report found the site posed a potential risk to human health and recommended that a thorough site inspection be completed to find out for sure. EPA toxicologist Charlie Partridge has said the chemical concentrations found in 2009 present a fairly low risk to people, as does the potential exposure pathway. In 2009, tetrachloroethylene (PCE) was detected in groundwater near Butte High at more than double the state’s standards. The highest concentration was 12 micrograms per liter and the standard is 5 micrograms per liter. The contamination was over 20 feet deep. PCE is commonly used in dry cleaning solvents, adhesives and degreasing aerosols like brake cleaner. The chemical can cause neurological, kidney and liver damage, and is a probable carcinogen. Also detected in the plume was trichloroethylene (TCE), another chemical used in a variety of industrial products and by commercial dry cleaners for spot removal. According to the National Cancer Institute, TCE can cause kidney cancer and may be associated with increased risk for other cancers as well. The contaminated groundwater was first discovered during excavation for the bleachers at Butte High’s Naranche Stadium in 2009, according to the 2021 report to the EPA. Butte School District No. 1 hired Butte-based engineering firm Water and Environmental Technologies to monitor the area with 10 shallow wells in 2009, according to the report, and the data was provided to the DEQ. The DEQ had conducted a 2008 investigation of the closed Unique Dry Cleaners facility at 345 S. Main St. — directly northwest of the high school and right across the street from Naranche Stadium. Given the proximity to the school and field, the DEQ considered the facility a likely source for the contaminants. This year’s report to the EPA also named Unique Cleaners as a possible source. Unique Cleaners did use PCE from the 1930s until approximately 1999, according to the report, but another dry cleaner and other industrial shops also operated in the immediate area. “We cannot definitively say that it was Unique Cleaners because those are common chemicals that are used in industrial settings. It's just a likely source, considering what is around that location,” Chisholm said. The chief concern is the potential impact to students, staff and faculty working at Butte High, and to residents of the apartment building at 436 S. Main St. The plume is suspected to sit underneath part of both buildings, as well as a couple of nearby businesses, Chisholm said. Partridge assessed the risk based on the concentrations found in 2009. “We believe that the risk is fairly low,” Partridge said in October. Solvents can vaporize from groundwater, move into the air, and accumulate in the indoor air of overlying structures. Kevin Stone, public information specialist with the DEQ, said that the plume was considered a low risk when first discovered because there wasn’t a pathway to drinking water. “That coupled with the relatively low concentrations that we saw in the groundwater data led us to believe this was a low-risk site,” he said.

An interim legislative committee on Thursday unanimously voted to reject industry rules proposed by the Department of Revenue\'s new cannabis division, with plans to rework the proposal early next week. The deadline to wrap up the department\'s rules is quickly approaching, with legalization taking full effect Jan. 1 and marijuana providers gearing up for the state\'s first recreational market. But lawmakers on Thursday took issue with several of the rules proposed by the Cannabis Control Division, including labeling terminology and growing capacities for the tribes, each of which were afforded a single, license as part of the Legislature\'s legalization framework bill passed earlier this year. The department develops rules to essentially fill in the gaps left in legislation, although lawmakers said Thursday the rules were running afoul of their intent when they wrote the bill. ""The one thing we are charged with, being the Legislature, is we do the policy,"" Sen. Jason Ellsworth, R-Hamilton, said. ""The Department of Revenue doesn\'t do policy."" The committee has called back several rules already this year, although the department has said it\'s only following the law as lawmakers wrote it. In House Bill 701, the legalization framework bill, lawmakers prohibited cannabis providers from selling hemp. The revenue department then, told providers they would not be able to sell CBD, a derivative of hemp. The Economic Affairs Interim Committee in November asked the Cannabis Control Division to fix the issue, again arguing it went against their intent. Sen. Shane Morigeau, D-Missoula, took issue Thursday with the department\'s interpretation of the law — which stated tribes would be allowed one tier 1 license, the smallest capacity license to grow cannabis. The department\'s proposed rule would not allow tribes to scale up their operation and apply for a higher tiered license. ""Our intent throughout the process has always been that it be fair and equitable, that these entities, these tribes can tier up through that system,"" Morigeau said. Jameson Walker, the committee\'s staff attorney, said his reading of the provision did not specifically allow tribes a license higher than tier 1, but it did not necessarily prevent it, either. ""It\'s in the gray area,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Department of Revenue said Thursday no tribe has applied for a license. Ellsworth made the motion that threw the brakes on the department\'s rules until Monday, when the department will meet with the committee again at 2 p.m. to retool the proposals. Kristan Barbour, the Cannabis Control Division administrator, said during the meeting they remain willing to work with the committee. ""We look forward to having these discussions in the coming days,"" Barbour said. Sen.

Craig Widhalm, incoming Valier Schools Superintendent, and the Valier School District Board of Trustees held an open meeting on Thursday, April 29, to begin discussion on the possibility of transitioning to a four-day school week. An audience of 19 community members and school district staff members attended the meeting. Widhalm made it clear that a four-day student week was not an action item for the 2021-22 school year, but a topic that merits discussion going forward. Pros and cons to changing the schedule were voiced during the meeting. Frequently expressed concerns during the meeting from those opposing a shortened week included: •More unsupervised hours for students with working parents. •Fewer meals provided for low-income families. •Possible lack of subject retention over the longer weekends. Those supporting a shortened school week cited: •More family and rest time for busy students. •Fewer travel hours on hazardous roads. •Attracting and retaining teachers. The Valier School District is currently seeking to fill at least six teaching positions for the 2021-22 school year. Widhalm, who is currently the superintendent at Denton, noted the Denton School District transitioned to a four-day week this school year. He pointed out a four-day week “does not save money” and “staffing is the biggest issue.” He also shared creative ways that the district worked with patrons to address day care and other needs the four-day schedule presented. While there appeared to be more support for a shortened week for high school students than for elementary, Widhalm clarified that both schools must be on the same schedule under the teachers union Collaborative Bargaining Agreement. After much discussion from the board and audience, it was proposed to form a committee comprised of staff, board members and parents to explore the data and reach out to districts that have moved to a four-day schedule. Their goal is to determine if, and when, the change would be in best interest of Valier students. Additionally, public meetings to discuss the committee’s findings would be held prior to moving forward with any changes to the current schedule. Those attending last week’s meeting agreed there is a real need to find creative ways to attract and retain teachers and improve attendance and academic performance by students.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:35 pm Danny Edmo, Dutch Lunak, JC Augare and Scottie Augare continue to provide Native stunt riding in television and movie productions, along with many talented riders from Blackfeet Country. “There will be a season two, and I get to coordinate that,” said Danny Edmo, stunt coordinator for the new hit series, Reservation Dogs. “I did all but the pilot episode, and it’s opened a lot of doors for us as Native people.” The 37-year-old stunt coordinator began his life’s journey at home on the Blackfeet Reservation. “I grew up with rodeo – steers and bulls,” Danny said. “My dad, Jack Edmo Sr., and Alan Sherman raised bucking horses so I’ve been on a horse since I can remember…that’s what got me started in rodeo.” A graduate of Browning High School, Danny was on the championship State A basketball team in 2001 and 2002. At the same time, he was into rodeo “pretty heavy” up through 2004, competing in the Indian National Finals Rodeo in 1999, 2003 and 2004. After high school, Danny moved to New Mexico when his father took a job with the Indian Health Service. He was there in 2004 when he competed at the INFR in California, winning the championship in bull riding. Returning to Albuquerque for Christmas with his family, Danny attended a New Year’s Eve party where a casting agent was looking for Native Americans who could ride bareback. The next day, Jack told Danny’s sisters about the offer. Since they needed a family member who was over 18 to go with them, Danny volunteered to come along. “When [my sisters] were getting their fittings, they asked if I wanted to get dressed for $150, and I thought, okay, I can do that before college and rodeo so I did it,” Danny said. “A week later on Jan. 1, it was cold and I was dressed up so I walked out on a hill for the Sand Creek Massacre scene, and some horses came over the hill with Scotty [Augare], Dutch [Lunak] and Beau [Michael]. We saw each other and they said, do you want to ride? And I said yes I do!” They were filming the television series, Into the West. “It took off from there,” Danny said. “I worked the next summer with the same coordinator on a bunch of Native stuff and slowly worked my way up and knowing people.” That small, some might say fated, beginning led to his more central position in movie making. “I get phone calls asking to work different shows, so I’m getting all the Native guys together,” he said. “Now that Dutch and Scotty aren’t stunting, I’m filling in their shoes.” As for Reservation Dogs, Danny was called in their search for an all-Native American production. “They reached out and recommended me for the job so I talked to a couple others,” Danny said. “They helped me out and gave me a shot, and it’s worked out awesome. The directors and actors are a blast to work with. It’s like being in a family, and all my success I owe to Dutch and Scotty.” So far, Reservation Dogs is a complete success. “Yeah, I’ve been hearing [good feedback],” he said. “It’s crazy; it’s awesome. It’s all Native, and it’s the first I’ve seen of that in forever. The story is Native – it’s all about them.” As for his predecessors, Danny has nothing but praise for those who came before. “Dutch and Scotty paved the way for everything,” he said. “I got a stunt group (Wagon Burner Stunts), and I’m bringing people from home. The Momberg boys and the younger generation are starting to come up and help. Native Americans are starting to do Native American stunts. We’re capable of doing all that, and we’re getting respect.” Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language. PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR CAPS LOCK.

Alpine Artisans\' Open Book Club and the Seeley Lake Historical Society are co-sponsoring McCarthy reading from her biography on Thursday, June 6 at the Seeley Lake Foundation Building at 7 p.m. Visit the historical museum\'s Maclean display that same day from 10:00 am until 6:30 pm to see their collection of Maclean... A day before Montana’s Drought and Water Supply Advisory Committee met to discuss the low precipitation levels of April and look at what was in store for the months to come, a traffic-stopping, Search and Rescue-compelling snowstorm occurred on Bozeman Pass on May 8. According to KBZK, the interstate was closed for almost 24 hours and some travelers were stuck in their cars for 15 hours. Those presenting at the committee meeting — including representatives from the Natural Resources Conservation Service and the U.S. Geological Survey ... The Lolo National Forest Plan Revision committee held the first of four meetings region-wide in Seeley Lake on Monday, May 20 at the Community Hall. Thirty people filled the chairs and contributed comments on draft alternatives to the proposed Lolo National Forest Plan. ""We just closed the scoping comment period on the proposed Lolo Forest Plan,"" Carolyn Upton, Lolo Forest Supervisor, said. ""Then I had a great idea, why don\'t we go to the communities to see if we got the issues right?"" The three issues the National Forest suggested for... Thirty-five years ago... Thursday June 1, 1989 Montana Senators seek compensation for forest fire losses Montana Senators Max Baucus and Conrad Burns are seeking $10 million in compensation for property losses from wildfires originating in Yellowstone National Park or National Forests in Montana and Wyoming. In a letter sent recently by Baucus, Burns and Wyoming Senators Malcome Wallop and Alan Simpson to Senator Robert Byrd, Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Department of the Interior, the... Montanans appreciate our locally grown food, from vegetables to huckleberries, raw honey and grass-fed beef. Can we say the same about our wood products? By supporting the forest industry in Montana, you are ensuring that wood products are coming from forests managed with some of the most stringent environmental laws in the world. The Missoula Chapter of the Society of American Foresters (SAF) supports investment in our local forest products industry. Montana’s identity is rooted in our forests. Sustaining the capacity for active forest... In a recent Letter to the Editor, Don Larson contends that the waterfront and riverfront properties are the worst septic effluent polluters on our lakes and waterfront. That is speculation. Even if it were proven to be true, how does that address the known elevated groundwater nitrate issue within the district? Mr. Larson’s comments on testing and repairing waterfront septic systems on all the lakes has merit but again, how does that address the known issue within the district? And, is there any reason why we can’t do what Mr. Larson... The winter of 2024 will be remembered as one of the driest winters on record for Montana. According to the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), the average statewide snow water equivalent (a measure of how much water is in our snowpack) was only about an inch above the 30-year-average record low in March. In the Mission Mountains of the upper Swan River watershed, the snow water equivalent was 36% below average. These conditions aren\'t a complete surprise, as forecasters predicted... To the people and voters of Seeley Lake, I thank you for the opportunity and honor of representing you in the Montana Legislature for the past eight years. Under Montana Law, I am ineligible to run again this year but, fortunately, there is a candidate who can and will serve the people of Seeley Lake very effectively. Rep. John Fitzpatrick, who currently represents Deer Lodge and Granite Counties, is now running in a new district which adds Powell County and Seeley Lake to the remainder of his old district. John Fitzpatrick served with me on... I’m grateful for the spiritual places we can go to get away from the busyness of life, like the temple or even a quiet room in our homes. I have also found that being in nature and its peacefulness has helped me connect with Heavenly Father. Is it great to feel the warmth of the sun on my skin, smelling the scent of fresh rainfall, or hearing the sound of a babbling creek. These things have allowed me to quiet my soul and prepare my heart to connect with heaven. Even the simplicity of... Greetings from the Chesapeake Bay. We have been working our way up through Virginia, now Maryland, through the lands of earliest English exploration, American Revolution, Civil War and other scrimmages/wars/skullduggery that created this country. Last week we visited the very battlefield at Yorktown, where English General Cornwallis blew a fourth quarter lead and surrendered to George Washington. All this history has filled me with patriotic fervor, a desire to give back to honor all the... In this season of Montana State politics, I cannot resist laying my hammer down, pen this letter to the editor, and expose the ugly and completely dishonest smear campaign that John Fitzpatrick is hurling at the public against Dave Kesler, candidate for House District 76. The citizens of Montana, and particularly your district, should be utterly appalled at the lies. Dave Kesler is an intelligent, honest, hard working and dedicated father who gives much to others. He will represent your district and all Montanans with integrity and truth, not... Powered by ROAR Online Publication Software from Lions Light Corporation © Copyright 2024'}]"
