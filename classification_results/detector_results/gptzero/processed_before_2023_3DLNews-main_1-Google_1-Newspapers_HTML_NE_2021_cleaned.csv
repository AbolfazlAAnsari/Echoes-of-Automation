The Jewell location, managed by John Herrmann, is adding to their grain handling capacity. Next to the ""old"" concrete grain silos is a new, 72 foot in diameter, 120 foot tall, silo. This new addition to the Jewell elevator location will hold 400,000 bushels. The first bushels will not be wheat from the soon to be harvested fields. The structure is complete but the machinery infrastructure is still being put in place. Actually, the first harvest to use the structure will be the 2021 soybean harvest. Much discussion and planning went into what type of a facility should be added to the location and where to place it. The new silo was deemed to be ""the best bang for the buck."" According to Kris Allen, general manager, the RFCU goal is to ""keep up with the combines and trucks"" of today. With the new addition, the old wooden elevator will be phased out during the next three years. The wooden elevator was built after a fire destroyed an even older elevator on Feb. 26, 1968.

Joe Ricketts is launching an online national news service called Straight Arrow News. The address of Straight Arrow News is listed as 9140 West Dodge Road. Take a look at the top photos from 2020 as captured by the photojournalist of the Omaha World-Herald LINCOLN — Billionaire businessman and philanthropist Joe Ricketts is preparing another venture into the news business, and he’s chosen Omaha as his launching pad. Ricketts is hiring staff to launch an online national news outlet called Straight Arrow News that he said will do what other outlets aren’t doing — providing news without a political slant. “I think there’s a gap in the market — there’s no source for unbiased, fact-based news. And I believe there’s a business opportunity there,” he said. “Some people say you can’t have unbiased news. I want to prove them wrong with Straight Arrow News,” he said. In the past few weeks, online job advertisements have been posted for a video editor, senior producer, news reporter, and motion graphics designer/producer for Straightarrownews.com. The ads say the endeavor will be “dedicated to unbiased, nonpartisan reporting” and is projected to start in February. The company was incorporated in Delaware in July. An October filing in New York State lists the company’ address as 9140 West Dodge Road. That is also the address of Hugo Enterprises, the holding company of for-profit and nonprofit endeavors of Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade. His family also owns the Chicago Cubs, and he opened a religious retreat center called Cloisters on the Platte south of Gretna. Ricketts said Straight Arrow does not involve any members of his family. That would include a son who’s the state’s top political figure, Gov. Pete Ricketts. It won’t be the first foray into journalism for Joe Ricketts, a leading funder of national conservative causes who is based in Wyoming. In 2009, he launched DNAinfo, a news website devoted to local news in New York City and Chicago. He bought another New York-based news site, Gothamist, in 2017, then merged the two. The news operation was said to have 9 million readers a month before Ricketts abruptly shut it down in November 2017 after staffers voted to form a union. He had written a blog months earlier saying unions create “a corrosive us-against-them dynamic” that harms business success. There were also reports that the news services were unprofitable. Ricketts, in response to emailed questions last week, said he plans Straight Arrow to be a “sustainable company” that generates profit. “I’ve built my career on the idea that a good business is one that serves an unmet customer need,” he said. “The market (now) is only giving them polarized, opinionated coverage.” He declined to say how large of a staff he is hiring or when exactly the service will launch, but he said Straight Arrow would initially focus on national news. Modern technology, Ricketts said, allows such an operation to be based anywhere there’s talent. And, he said, “there’s no place with more talented people than Omaha.” But he added that he’s still assembling a staff, who could come from anywhere. When asked about the launch of non-biased news source, Gary Kebbel, a professor emeritus of journalism at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said Straight Arrow News is a great name. “I think most people will say that’s exactly what they want,” Kebbel said, but he’s not convinced that is really, truly what they’re seeking. People’s attitudes about bias in news, he said, are colored by their own opinions. And people with strong political opinions on the right or left tend to be more passionate about seeking out stories than those in the middle of the spectrum, Kebbel said. Who will be the audience for this? he asked. Will Ricketts be providing something that Fox News isn’t? “I wonder if people would be open to it knowing (Ricketts’) background as a conservative, and if that will bring a certain amount of audience,” he said. “Or will they be ticked off if it’s not conservative enough, or ticked off if it’s truly nonbiased and nonpartisan?” Ricketts expressed confidence and said he will be building in “safeguards” so that his startup will truly deliver news without bias or political spin. “When Straight Arrow News is live, I think people will see there is an approach to news — news without bias — that is going to feel like a breath of fresh air,” he said.

The Hubbard Gap Fire in the Wildcat Hills south of Scottsbluff injured six firefighters and burned 4,000 acres in late August. The state’s dedicated firefighting plane plus six others were used in firefighting in 2020, compared with two or three in a normal year. But what’s normal is changing. A firefighter from a federal agency watches heavy fuels burn through the night inside the fire lines of the Aristocrat Fire near Chadron on Aug. 28. A landspout near Grant, Nebraska. Over the summer, a cluster of landspouts made for riveting photography. More than a dozen reports of landspouts were reported in Nebraska and northeastern Colorado on July 8, 2020. No damage was reported. This photo was taken near Thedford, Nebraska, shortly after 8 p.m. The sharp swing from one of Nebraska’s wettest years on record to widespread drought dominated the weather headlines in 2020. Through November, Nebraska was in the midst of its 15th driest year out of 126, while 2019 was the state’s third wettest. Most noticeable was August 2020, the state’s driest August on record. Weather extremes are normal in Nebraska because the state sits at the crossroads of continental climate patterns, said Martha Shulksi, Nebraska state climatologist. That can make it hard to detect the inflection of climate change, but global warming has supercharged the atmosphere with energy, she said. “More variations and back-to-back extremes (very wet to dry) are the signature of climate change,” she said. The following are five noteworthy weather stories of the year. Browning stalks of corn near Winslow, Nebraska, in September. Drought: At the start of 2020, not an acre of Nebraska was in drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Now, more than 99% of Nebraska is in drought, with half in severe to extreme drought. The state hasn’t seen a drought this extensive since the flash drought of 2012 lingered into 2013, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, based at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Rangeland declined so much that some ranchers sold cattle early to save on feed. Several counties were designated disasters. Wildfires: The state’s driest August on record fueled large range fires. By early September, the state had recorded more than 625 wildfires, the most since 2012, the state’s record year. The Hubbard Gap Fire in the Nebraska Panhandle left six volunteer firefighters injured, prompted two emergency evacuations and devoured 4,000 acres. The Aristocrat Fire near Chadron erupted the day after the Hubbard Gap Fire, and the two large fires severely taxed resources. The Hubbard Gap Fire burned nearly 4,000 acres in late August and proved dangerous and difficult to fight. It occurred mostly in the Wildcat Hills south of Scottsbluff, though some of it broke through to the grasslands and cropland along the hills. Firefighters contained it before it could get going in the flats. Hazy skies: Smoke from massive wildfires in western states turned Nebraska’s skies hazy and milky. For the most part, the smoke from the tragic fires remained in the upper atmosphere and did little more than enhance Nebraska sunsets. But there were days when it did filter down and affect air quality. At one point in September, visibility in the North Platte area dropped to about a mile, said Chris Buttler, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. Landspouts: The year was light on tornadoes, but clusters of landspouts occurred over the summer in Nebraska, lighting up social media and making for riveting photography. Landspouts lack the strength of traditional tornadoes and often appear as thin ropes. In July, the National Weather Service received more than a dozen reports of landspouts in western Nebraska and a handful in Colorado. Derecho: Eastern Nebraska was dealt a glancing blow by the derecho that devastated Iowa. Derechos are long-lived, straight-line wind storms, and this one traveled 770 miles, causing $7.5 billion in damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In Omaha and surrounding areas, about 57,000 customers of the Omaha Public Power District lost power, making the storm one of the 10 worst in the utility’s history. Other big weather news in 2019 included damaging winds and thunderstorms in south-central Nebraska, ice jam flooding in eastern Nebraska and snowstorms in September, October and late December.

Bill and Ruth Scott ""I just felt so grateful for their help and keeping me alive,"" Bill Scott said of the care he received in North Platte. ""It\'s a special thing for me to see the results out there."" The new emergency department at Great Plains Health in North Platte has helped patients and boosted staff morale. Bill Scott’s daily cigarette nearly killed him. But not in the way you might expect. Scott, a well-known Omaha philanthropist, suffered a spinal cord injury after he tripped and hit his head when he went out for an evening cigarette. Doctors at Great Plains Health in North Platte helped to stabilize Scott before sending him to Omaha for a brief hospital stay and rehab. After rehabilitation sessions, Scott fully recovered from the injury. Years later, Scott, who was Warren Buffett’s first employee, and Scott’s wife, Ruth, decided to show their gratitude for the care he was given in North Platte. The hospital recently opened an expanded and upgraded emergency room, thanks in part to a donation from the Scotts, who both are 90 years old. Bill and Ruth Scott decided to show their gratitude for the care Bill received in North Platte. The hospital recently opened an expanded and upgraded emergency room, thanks in part to a donation from the Scotts, who both are 90 years old. In 2005, Scott went on a golf trip with friends to the Sand Hills Golf Club near Mullen, Nebraska. After playing 18 holes and having dinner, Scott went back to his room. At about 10 p.m., he went outside for a cigarette. Scott slipped on a rug and hit his head on a heavy deck chair. He was knocked unconscious for several hours. He came to around 4:30 a.m., but couldn’t stand up. “I was wondering what was going to happen to me,” Scott said. “I didn’t have much in the way of ability to do anything.” Scott crawled over to a window and tapped on the glass. One of his fellow golfers was up getting a drink of water and heard the noise. Scott was rushed to the North Platte hospital. When he arrived, it was clear he had suffered a spinal cord injury, said Dr. James Smith, who examined him. Scott still was unable to move his arms and legs correctly. Smith quickly diagnosed him with central cord syndrome, which damaged the fibers inside his spinal cord. The condition is rare, Smith said, noting that he treats a case about once every five to 10 years. Scott was responsive but confused when he arrived at the hospital. He also arrived with a temperature of about 90 degrees because he had been lying outside all night. Once Scott was stable, he was transferred to the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Scott said he remembers tapping on the window, but everything after that is blank until he arrived in Omaha. Ruth Scott said she met her husband when he arrived at the Omaha hospital. Until then, she wasn’t aware of how bad his condition was. “A couple days later, when two big strong physical therapists got him out of bed,” she said, “his legs just wiggled in the air like noodles.” Scott stayed at the med center for about 10 days. Then he was transferred to Omaha’s Immanuel Medical Center for rehabilitation. Scott’s main focus was on walking again, but he also had to gain better control of his hands. He couldn’t swing a golf club or play the trumpet. “I had a polka band I wanted to get back to playing with,” Scott said. “That was a big inspiration for me, and it worked.” Eventually, Scott was back to swinging golf clubs and playing in the band. He reached out to Smith to tell him about his progress. Smith was amazed. “He’s made such a wonderful recovery,” Smith said. “Obviously, he’s a fighter.” Scott asked Smith what charities he supported. Smith told him about his children’s school in North Platte. Scott wanted to make a donation. Through his work for Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway, Scott had accumulated enough stock to become independently wealthy. He retired in the early 1990s. The Scotts, both Ashland natives, have made multimillion-dollar donations to a long list of causes at the University of Nebraska, including at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Smith and his former patient have kept in touch over the years with emails and phone calls. Scott reaches out every year on the day of the accident — Aug. 22. It’s what Smith calls “Bill Scott Day.” “Bill just got to thinking he owed that doctor a lot,” Ruth Scott said. So in 2013, Scott sent Smith another email, asking if there was any way he and his wife could help the North Platte hospital. In fact, the hospital’s emergency department was outdated, cramped and crowded. Patients sometimes were placed in the hallways. The emergency department at Great Plains Health in North Platte officially reopened in October after undergoing an extensive remodeling. The remodeling was made possible in part by a donation from Bill and Ruth Scott of Omaha. The Scotts offered $5 million toward the $15.5 million emergency department expansion project at Great Plains Health. The hospital had $5 million in hand already. It would be up to the community to raise the additional money. “I just felt so grateful for their help and keeping me alive,” Scott said. “It’s a special thing for me to see the results out there.” The expansion doubled the number of rooms in the emergency department. One room is designed to treat victims of sexual assaults. Other rooms are designed to treat people with behavioral health issues. Eight rooms have been designed with negative pressure, which has helped in treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Officials broke ground on the expansion project in 2018. The department officially reopened in October. “They’ve had a huge impact on the health care in west-central Nebraska,” said Mel McNea, CEO of Great Plains Health.

Buffalo Bills center Mitch Morse (60) points to a defender before snapping the ball during the second quarter at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park. Bills offensive tackles Daryl Williams and Dion Dawkins turned in technically sound performances against star pass rushers Chase Young and Montez Sweat. Give quarterback Josh Allen and offensive coordinator Brian Daboll big assists in preventing the Washington Football Team from getting a single sack in the Bills’ 43-21 victory. Williams blocked Young, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2020 draft, 34 times in pass protection and gave up only four hurries, according to Buffalo News charts. Dawkins blocked Sweat 29 times in pass protection and gave up only one hurry. Both offensive tackles got their hands on the big edge rushers and almost never got beaten cleanly. It was just the third time in the last 31 games that Washington was held without a sack. But it was a team effort. The Bills focused on the quick passing game and exploited Washington’s linebackers in the middle of the field in zone coverage. “That’s great,” guard Jon Feliciano said. “When Josh is out there getting the ball out quick, it kind of brings the D-line down because they're like, ‘Damn, how am I supposed to get a sack when the ball is going out this quick?’ ” The Bills did a little bit of chipping on the edge rushers with a running back or tight end, but not a lot. Daboll used play action to cause the Washington pass rush to respect the run for a beat or two on pass plays. Allen was 11 of 14 for 181 yards and a touchdown on play-action fakes. “That's one thing I think we did today that was put them in good situations,” Allen said. “And there were a couple of plays, we alerted some checks to get out of bad situations. They played well, they executed, they communicated well. It's fun to play back there when you have that confidence in them. And I've got, you know, supreme confidence in our front five right now.” Allen was sensational when he faced pressure. His first two touchdown passes and his touchdown run all came when he calmly navigated pressure in the pocket. “I'm watching an offensive line improve every week,” said coach Sean McDermott. “It's not where it needs to be yet, and we're not where we need to be. I'm not where I need to be. Just embracing that, and let's go back to work, let's put on the blue jeans and the hard hat and go back to work and earn it. And I thought they did a good job.” Washington put the onus on its front four to get pressure. Defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio blitzed Allen on only 5 of 46 dropbacks, according to News charts. Allen was 5 of 5 for 68 yards vs. rushes of five or more, and that included the 41-yard deep pass to Emmanuel Sanders. Williams and Dawkins did a good job of using their long arms to get their hands on the defensive ends and steer them wide of the quarterback. Feliciano got help double-teaming Jonathan Allen on occasion, and the 2017 first-round pick managed only one pressure. “I feel like 93, Jon Allen, doesn't get the credit he deserves,” Feliciano said. “I think he's the best guy on their front, the dude’s a werewolf.” It was a good thing the outside matchups went well for Buffalo, because guard Cody Ford struggled with the speed of defensive tackle Daron Payne, the 13th overall pick in 2018. By The News’ count, Ford gave up eight pressures to Payne. Pro Football Focus gave Ford 12 pressures allowed. The best thing that can be said about Ford is most of the time, he protected inside but was getting beaten to the outside by Payne’s speed. That allowed Allen to step up in the pocket. On the first six pressures allowed by Ford to Payne, Allen was 5 for 5 for 104 yards. One of those was a poised slide in the pocket by Allen to avoid Payne and throw a 23-yard third-down completion to Gabriel Davis. On the next one, Payne got across Ford’s face and flushed Allen to the right sideline, where he threw a 28-yard TD pass to Emmanuel Sanders. If more than one Bills lineman had been giving up pressure on any given play – as happened in the season opener against Pittsburgh – Payne might have had a bigger impact on the game. “Going into this game, we knew that that they had that hype,” Dawkins said. “There's a lot of high-profile guys, all first-round guys, all high-caliber dudes. And we just knew that we had to worry about ourselves, cuz you can get lost in the sauce, honestly, if you take that approach like, ‘Man, that's Chase Young, that's Sweat, that's Payne, that's Allen.
