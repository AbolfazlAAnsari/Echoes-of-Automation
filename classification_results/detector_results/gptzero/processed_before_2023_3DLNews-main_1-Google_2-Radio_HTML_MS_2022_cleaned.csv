Kenyatta ‘Kesha Webster was found dead in Jackson on March 26th. Shawmayné Marie, a 27 year old from Gulfport, was shot and killed on June 21. And Jimmie ‘Jay’ Lee, who was gender nonconforming, was killed in early July. Jensen Matar, Director at the TRANS Program, says a ceremony is being held on Sunday this week to remember those who have died or are victims of abuse. “We make it as big of a deal as we can to make sure that those people are not forgotten, and they are celebrated, and that we work towards a better future where trans and non-binary people are not murdered simply because they decide to be honest with themselves and live in their truth,” says Matar. Despite this being Trans Awareness Week, Governor Tate Reeves shared on social media Wednesday his plans to limit the rights of trans and non-binary youth. In what the governor is proposing as a ‘Parent’s Bill of Rights’, the policy would allow parents to prevent teachers from calling their children by preferred pronouns or names. Matar says policies such as this can contribute to the already high suicide rate of trans youth. Matar says “He’s targeting young trans children because it’s the hot topic right now and he knows he can get a rise out of folks on social media. But there’s actually no real way to implement this anyways.” Ceremonies for the Trans Day of Remembrance are being held in several cities across the state, and allies are invited to attend a ceremony in Jackson Sunday afternoon.'}]"
