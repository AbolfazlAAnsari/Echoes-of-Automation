(WSMV/Gray News) – An arrest affidavit for music star Darius Rucker shows that the alleged offenses happened nearly a year ago in Tennessee. Rucker, known for being the lead singer of Hootie & the Blowfish and his solo career in the country music scene, was arrested nearly a year after he was found with psychedelic drugs during a traffic stop in Franklin, Tennessee, the affidavit said. On Feb. 19, 2023, a Franklin Police Department officer pulled Rucker over for a traffic violation on Murfreesboro Road. Police said they smelled the odor of marijuana coming from the singer’s GMC pickup. When asked, Rucker said had “smoked weed in the vehicle,” but not that night, according to the affidavit. Police said they searched the vehicle, and an officer found 14 unstamped, grayish and purple pills and a THC pen, which read “88.5% THC,” the affidavit said. Police said they also found a blunt on Rucker. Rucker told police his girlfriend gave him the items and he did not know what the pills were. Police released Rucker from the scene without charges, pending the identification of the 14 pills. An arrest warrant was signed after the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said the pills tested positive for psilocybin, a psychedelic and Schedule I controlled substance. Rucker is facing charges of simple possession, casual exchange and violation of registration law. He was released Thursday on a $10,500 bond. Hootie & the Blowfish, of which Rucker is a member, is set to return to the road this summer. “Darius Rucker is fully cooperating with authorities related to misdemeanor charges,” Rucker’s attorney Mark Puryear said.
