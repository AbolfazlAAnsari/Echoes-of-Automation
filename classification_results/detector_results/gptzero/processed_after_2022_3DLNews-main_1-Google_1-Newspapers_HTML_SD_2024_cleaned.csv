Theoretically speaking, the United States will be having a presidential election in 2024. Everybody acts as if it’s a sure thing. Political “horse race” coverage dominates the news. Debates, rallies and candidate speeches take place. Newspapers and TV news outlets publish polling results every few days. Everybody’s familiar with the ritual, and everybody plays along. That’s the whole point of rituals. All the solemn mummery of holding a presidential election, right down to the balloons and silly hats, exists to reassure the public that everything will be all right. That’s why phony democratic elections are the essence of dictatorial regimes around the world. Everybody plays the game. Russia, China, Myanmar — you name it. Record voter turnout is assured. Vladimir Putin will no doubt win a thunderous majority. But real democracies can be fragile things. Let’s try an analogy from the sports page. Consider the recent national collegiate football championship. What would we say about it if one team — say, the Michigan Wolverines — showed up with assault rifles and vowed to shoot referees who threw penalty flags adverse to them? Well, we wouldn’t call it a football game. So how can we call it a proper election when everybody knows that the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party, one Donald J. Trump, will refuse to accept defeat? Adam Serwer puts it this way in The Atlantic: “There is something naive to assuming that Trump would accept such a verdict from the electorate a second time when he didn’t accept it the first time. Neither a close election nor a sound defeat matters when Trump can induce his supporters to believe any fiction he conjures.” And there appears to be little doubt that he can. The GOP front-runner’s campaign appearances in Iowa have been almost phantasmagoric of late. He has gone so far as to post a TV commercial on his Truth Social website claiming that he is God’s Chosen One. Narrated in the electronically re-created voice of the late radio pitchman Paul Harvey, the ad begins like this: “And on June 14, 1946, God looked down on his planned paradise, and said, ‘I need a caretaker.’ So God gave us Trump.” Got that? Trump’s birth was divinely inspired. Try to imagine the hullabaloo if President Joe Biden even hinted at such a thing. They’d say the old fool had clearly lost it. “Dementia” would be the kindest diagnosis. Instead, what Biden did say in a speech near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, was that Trump was an unpatriotic sore loser, and nothing more. “Trump lost 60 court cases. Sixty. Trump lost the Republican-controlled states. Trump lost before a Trump-appointed judge — and then judges — and Trump lost before the United States Supreme Court ... “Trump lost recount after recount after recount and state after state. But in desperation and weakness, Trump and his MAGA followers went after election officials.” Biden described Trump’s actions and inaction during the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol as “among the worst derelictions of duty by a president in American history: an attempt to overturn a free and fair election by force and violence.” And Trump’s response? He went all sixth-grade bully on the president before an audience of Iowa supporters. “Did you see him? He was stuttering through the whole thing,” Trump told a crowd in Sioux Center, Iowa. “He’s saying I’m a threat to democracy. “’He’s a threat to d-d-democracy,’” he continued, pretending to stutter. “Couldn’t read the word.” Many in the audience, who, of course, hadn’t seen Biden’s speech, chortled. “The remark was not true,” The Washington Post reported. “Biden said the word ‘democracy’ 29 times in his speech, never stuttering over it.” As if that wasn’t lowdown and infantile enough, Trump dragged the late Sen. John McCain into it, mimicking McCain’s inability to raise his arm over his head due to injuries sustained under torture in a North Vietnamese prison camp. Trump was never fit to shine McCain’s shoes. Not that he’d know how. The great tribune of the common man hires butlers for that. Outraged MAGA supporters should do themselves the favor of watching the video of these incidents before sending me threatening emails. Otherwise, knock yourselves out. Alternatively, check out the video of Trump telling a credulous Lou Dobbs the other day that thanks to Biden, gasoline now sells for “5, 6, 7 and even $8 a gallon.” I don’t know about you, but I filled up yesterday for $2.37. Another few months of Trump’s screeching and whining, and all but the dullest MAGA cultists are apt to catch on. So no, I think there’s little chance of Trump winning a national election. But that’s not the point, which is that there’s no possibility of this profoundly disordered man conceding defeat, and every chance that the authoritarians mobilizing behind his candidacy — the Steve Bannons and Stephen Millers — will be far better prepared the second time around.

Lindbergh Jr., the 20-month-old son of Charles and Anne Lindbergh. (Hauptmann was later executed.) On this date: • In 1633, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei arrived in Rome for trial before the Inquisition, accused of defending Copernican theory that the Earth revolved around the sun instead of the other way around. (Galileo was found vehemently suspect of heresy and ended up being sentenced to a form of house arrest.) • In 1933, the Warsaw Convention, governing airlines\' liability for international carriage of persons, luggage and goods, went into effect. • In 1939, Justice Louis D. Brandeis retired from the U.S. Supreme Court. (He was succeeded by William O. Douglas.) • In 1965, during the Vietnam War, President Lyndon B. Johnson authorized Operation Rolling Thunder, an extended bombing campaign against the North Vietnamese. • In 1972, the film ""Cabaret,"" directed by Bob Fosse, based on John Kander and Fred Ebb\'s musical of the same name, starring Liza Minnelli and Michael York, was released. • In 1980, the 13th Winter Olympics opened in Lake Placid, New York. • In 1991, during Operation Desert Storm, allied warplanes destroyed an underground shelter in Baghdad that had been identified as a military command center; Iraqi officials said 500 civilians were killed. • In 1996, the rock musical ""Rent,"" by Jonathan Larson, opened off-Broadway less than three weeks after Larson\'s death. • In 2000, Charles Schulz\'s final ""Peanuts"" strip ran in Sunday newspapers, the day after the cartoonist died in his sleep at his California home at age 77. • In 2002, John Walker Lindh pleaded not guilty in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, to conspiring to kill Americans and supporting the Taliban and terrorist organizations. (Lindh later pleaded guilty to lesser offenses and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.) • In 2011, Egypt\'s military leaders dissolved parliament, suspended the constitution and promised elections in moves cautiously welcomed by protesters who had helped topple President Hosni Mubarak. • In 2013, beginning a long farewell to his flock, a weary Pope Benedict XVI celebrated his final public Mass as pontiff, presiding over Ash Wednesday services inside St. Peter\'s Basilica at the Vatican. • In 2016, Justice Antonin Scalia, the influential conservative and most provocative member of the U.S. Supreme Court, was found dead at a private residence in the Big Bend area of West Texas; he was 79. • In 2017, President Donald Trump\'s embattled national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned following reports he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his contacts with Russia. • In 2018, President Donald Trump\'s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, said he had paid $130,000 out of his own pocket to a porn actress who claimed to have had a sexual relationship with Trump. • In 2021, former President Donald Trump was acquitted by the Senate at his second impeachment trial, the first to involve a former president, in which he was accused of inciting the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6; seven Republicans joined all 50 Democrats in voting to convict, but it was far from the two-thirds threshold required. • In 2022, playing in their home stadium, the Los Angeles Rams beat the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 in the Super Bowl. • In 2023, David Jude Jolicoeur aka Trugoy the Dove, one of the founding members of the hip-hop trio De La Soul, died at age 54.

One interesting aspect of writing a newspaper column is reader letters and emails. Lately, mine have been more supportive and friendly than not. I usually try to respond, although I’ve fallen down on the job of late. So, if you’ve sent me a fan letter and haven’t heard back, my apologies. I do read them all. Especially the ones from people who are fond of cows. Oddly, given the state of permanent outrage in which many Trumpers appear to live, it’s been months since I’ve gotten a death threat. Maybe that’s because it’s pretty much impossible to send an anonymous email. You can create a false identity, but it’s harder to disguise where a message has originated. People learn these things from watching CSI programs on TV. Then there are the ones from people who claim they refuse to read my offerings but are outraged anyway. They tend to be online tough guys. Here’s a classic of the genre: “Just when I didn’t think you could say anything stupider, I never read your articles just your stupid headlines because it’s when I turn the page how can you say Trump’s mental health when you’ve been looking at four years of the most stupid man ever as president as a former marine combat infantry man I despise the fact your even in my country, get the [bleep] out my country you Commie!!!” Well, it’s my country too, Ace. None of my friends who are former Marines appear to think their service has given them ownership rights. But then they don’t brag about their service, either, so it makes me wonder about the true extent of our hero’s combat experience. The figure of the miles gloriosus, or braggart soldier, has been a stock character in comedy since the Roman dramatist Plautus wrote a play with that title circa 206 B.C. Shakespeare’s Sir John Falstaff is perhaps the most famous example: a blowhard and a rascal who considers honor and courage delusions. A bit like Trump, actually, but much funnier. It’s also remarkable how many are stymied by what I call the Mystery of the Apostrophe. You know, as in “your” Trump Derangement Syndrome [or TDS] vs. “you’re a Commie.” Sixth-grade stuff. Speaking of elementary school, my son Gavin’s invariable response when he got his hand caught in the cookie jar was, “What about Doug?” Doug being his younger brother, equally prone to foraging for treats. Just so my aggrieved correspondents, who ask, “What about Joe?” A classic example, politer than most: “You completely ignore the facts regarding your man, Joe Biden’s, continuous and accelerating cognitive decline and focus on the mental decline of Donald Trump. Yes, it’s true that he spouts off ridiculous, misleading and sometimes dangerous statements, but you, as a member of the liberal state-run democratic media, are scared to death that Trump may win the election and COMPLETELY IGNORE the daily gaffes, errors, lies and total decline of Biden’s mental ability and capacity. I long for the days when the media was unbiased and reported facts, not just your slanting of what you consider to be facts that you believe that the general public needs to know according to your agenda.” You’ve got to love that “state-run democratic media” part. I can’t decide what’s more foolish: this fellow’s seeming belief that the small-city Tennessee newspaper where he found my column is part of the “state-run democratic media” or that I’m in it for the big bucks. “Of course it is clear to me and others that you do this for the $$$’s. It’s easy to profit by spewing hate on a popular figure.” What’s clear to me is that this fellow — one of several who made similar accusations — has no idea what’s been going on in the news media since the advent of the internet. Newspapers have been going out of business in droves. Many also appear to have no concept of the distinction between news coverage and opinion columns, which are expected to be factual, yes, but also opinionated. What I’m still waiting for is a single correspondent who can identify a factual error in the column that set them off, which concerned Trump’s crazy confusing of former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and his Republican primary opponent Nikki Haley. What made Trump’s “gaffe” truly outrageous is that the whole thing was based upon a particularly brazen and thunderous lie. Specifically, that there was ever a phone conversation between then-President Trump and anybody at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, regarding military protection for Congress. Did not happen. Trump made no such call. Pelosi never received one. Haley bore no responsibility and was nowhere in the vicinity. I’ve challenged several of my correspondents to show me any remotely similar episode involving Biden. One guy said he once called Kamala Harris “President Harris.” Otherwise, crickets.

the Kansas City Chiefs parade shooting for Wednesday, Feb. 14. For the latest news on shooting, view our live updates file for Thursday, Feb. 15. Bullets ripped through crowds of spectators following a Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl victory parade attended by tens of thousands Wednesday, killing one and injuring at least 21 others in the nation\'s latest shooting assault at a major sports or concert venue. Kansas City, Missouri, police confirmed shots were fired west of Union Station at around 2 p.m. local time. Interim Fire Chief Ross Grundyson said at a news conference that 22 people suffered gunshot wounds, including one fatality, eight with immediately life-threatening injuries, seven with life-threatening injuries, and six with minor injuries. Several people near the parade route were carried away on stretchers. Lisa Augustine, spokesperson for Children’s Mercy Kansas City, said the hospital was treating 12 patients from the rally, including 11 children, some of whom suffered gunshot wounds. Police Chief Stacey Graves said three people have been detained, but detectives are investigating whether one person was among a group of bystanders who assisted police and possibly tackled an assailant. “I’m angry at what happened today. The people who came to this celebration should expect a safe environment,” Graves said at a news conference. Radio station KKFI said in a Facebook post Wednesday evening that DJ Lisa Lopez-Galvan, host of “Taste of Tejano,” was killed in the shooting. “This senseless act has taken a beautiful person from her family and this KC Community,” KKFI said. Lopez-Galvan, whose DJ name was “Lisa G,” was an extrovert and devoted mother from a prominent Latino family in the area, said Rosa Izurieta and Martha Ramirez, two childhood friends who worked with her at a staffing company. Izurieta said Lopez-Galvan had attended the parade with her husband and her adult son, a die-hard Kansas City sports fan who also was shot. “She’s the type of person who would jump in front of a bullet for anybody — that would be Lisa,” Izurieta said. Some of the Chiefs\' players spoke at the rally but were not in the line of fire when shots rang out. A team official said players and coaches were not injured and were on buses leaving the area. More than 800 law enforcement officers were providing security for the parade route, Graves said. Several hundred thousand people had been expected to attend the parade celebrating the Chiefs\' championship victory Sunday. President Joe Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland were briefed on the shooting. Biden said late Wednesday night that the shooting stirs deep emotion because of its ties to a Super Bowl celebration and he asked people to ""make your voice heard in Congress."" He said the end goal is to ban assault weapons, to limit high-capacity magazines, strengthen background checks, and keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn\'t have them. ""The Super Bowl is the most unifying event in America,"" Biden said. ""Nothing brings more of us together. And the celebration of a Super Bowl win is a moment that brings a joy that can’t be matched to the winning team and their supporters. For this joy to be turned to tragedy today in Kansas City cuts deep in the American soul."" Agents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were at the parade and assisting local police, the Justice Department said in a statement. Shootings at victory rallies are not unheard of in recent years. After the Denver Nuggets’ championship parade last year, a shooting took place in downtown Denver that injured two people, though police said they didn’t believe the incident was associated with the actual celebration. Also last year, an argument resulted in shots being fired at a parking lot near the Texas Rangers’ World Series championship parade. Nobody was injured. A shooting at a concert in Dallas left one dead and 16 injured in 2022. In October 2017, a gunman opened fire on the crowd attending the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada from his 32nd-floor suites in the Mandalay Bay hotel. He fired more than 1,000 rounds, killing 60 people and wounding at least 413 in what remains the deadliest mass shooting by a single gunman in American history. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson said he was at the parade with first lady Teresa Parson when shots were fired, but they had safely evacuated. “State law enforcement personnel are assisting local authorities in response efforts,” Gov. Parson said in a social media post. “As we wait to learn more, our hearts go out to the victims.” Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly was also at the rally but posted an update that she was safe. “At the end of the Chiefs rally, shots were fired near Union Station. I have been evacuated and am out of harm\'s way. I encourage everyone to follow instructions and updates from @kcpolice. Please stay safe,” Kelly said on X, formerly Twitter. Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas attended the parade with his wife and mother and had to run for cover when gunfire broke out. “I think that’s something that all of us who are parents, who are just regular people living each day, have to decide what we wish to do about,” Lucas said. “Parades, rallies, schools, movies. It seems like almost nothing is safe.” Kevin Sanders, 53, of Lenexa, Kansas, said he heard what sounded like firecrackers and then people running. After that initial flurry, calm returned, and he didn’t think much of it. But he said 10 minutes later, ambulances started showing up. “It sucks that someone had to ruin the celebration, but we are in a big city,” Sanders said. Ofilio Martinez, 48, said he heard shots fired a couple blocks away about 10 or 15 minutes before the gunfire near the Union Station rally. “This is making me nervous, scared,” he said. Gunfire broke out less than half an hour after Chiefs fans concluded their parade in celebration of the Super Bowl victory. The rally was scheduled to end at Union Station with speeches by players and coaches. Photos: Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade went from celebration to deadly shooting Fans in Kansas City got to experience yet another parade celebrating the Super Bowl champions. This year, Tara Bennett said it was more special as she and her friends cheered the team on throughout the season and defended their title as Super Bowl Champions. ""It was exciting and so much fun seeing the players coming down and having fun with people with their family celebrating the city,"" Bennett, a Kansas City resident, said. ""It was beautiful today and we kept taking layers off because it was warm with the sun beating down."" That was ripped away when she saw news about a possible shooting spread as she and her friend walked toward their car. Their fears were confirmed when they turned on the radio.

Visitation will begin at 1 p.m. on Wednesday, one hour prior to the funeral, at the Hamill Community Hall in Hamill, SD. Joseph Leroy “Joe” Fott passed away peacefully at home in Hamill South Dakota on May 17, 2024. Joe was born on Nov. 26, 1941 to Joseph and Anna (Fortuna) Fott in Winner South Dakota, joining his siblings brother Lawrence and sister Adeline on the family farm near Hamill South Dakota. Joe attended North Fairview grade school near Hamill and high school in Winner, SD, graduating from high school in 1959. He attended Greer Technical Institute in Wilmington, Illinois for diesel and construction mechanics after high school. Joe joined the South Dakota National Guard and did basic training in Fort Leonard Wood, MO, and served in the Chamberlain South Dakota Guard 200th Engineer Bridge Company until discharge in 1970. Joe and Judith Mae Gordon were married on May 8, 1965 and had two children, Joseph Wade in 1966 and Joy Michele in 1969. Joe spent his entire life farming and ranching on the family farm in Hamill. Joe said that he had not worked a day in his life because he enjoyed everything involved with the farm. Joe especially loved anything with an engine and wheels or tracks, and spent many long days in the seat of a tractor with a smile on his face and a steady hand on the steering wheel working on the farm. Joe was happy to share his knowledge and offer a helping hand to his neighbors and friends. Joe was a very outgoing and social person, meeting people and making new friends wherever he went. Joe loved to take road trips when a good rain would pause the farming, wife Judy would hear “how soon can you be ready to leave?” and had many adventures while visiting many of the western states he would say “I wonder what is down that road? Lets go find out.” Joe loved to hunt and started hunting at a young age. Joe and his family shared their love of hunting and the bounty of the Hamill farm with friends from near and far, making lifelong friends and lasting memories in the fields and hills. In the late 1970’s, Joe hosted then South Dakota governor Bill Janklow for a pheasant hunt on the farm, this hunt was the start of what became the South Dakota Governor’s Hunt that Joe and his family helped to host for 25 years. Later in life, Joe was not able to continue actively working on the farm due to physical limitations. He did not want to retire from the farm, and always wanted to be out monitoring the equipment, crops and cows, and sharing his experiences and knowledge with neighbors and daughter Joy who is operating the family farm. Joe is preceded in death by his parents Joseph Fott and Anna (Fortuna) Fott, sister Adeline Hight, brother Lawrence as well as his uncle John Fott and aunt Bessie (Fott) Petr and many aunts and uncle from the Fortuna side of the family. Joe is survived by wife Judy (Gordon) Fott, son Joseph Wade and wife Wendy and children Joseph Stephen and Anna Helena, daughter Joy Michele and spouse Faye Heinis and Cynthia. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Joe’s name to Hamill Community Hall or the Tripp County 4H.

your floors clean is about like using a kitchen colander to stem the flow of Niagara Falls. This is especially true if you have pets or children or pets that you consider to be your children. The combination of melting snow and bare earth creates that fascinating substance known as mud. Kids and pets are drawn to mud like iron to a humungous electromagnet that’s powerful enough to pull the rivets out of the Eiffel Tower. Mud magnetism is by no means limited to kids and pets. My wife and I live on a gravel road. No matter how often we wash our car, it insists on wearing a thick coat of grime. On the one hand, there isn’t much point in washing the car if it’s just going to get dirty again on our drive home. On the other hand, the carwash removes about 30 pounds of gunk. This decrease in weight probably increases our fuel efficiency. A small fortune could be had by reclaiming all the gravel that’s removed each week at our local carwash. At this time of year, we can have warm, sunny days that might cause us to imagine that we live in the balmy subtropics. But then an icy gale will sweep down from the north, shattering our fantasies like a rose that has been dunked in liquid nitrogen. The upside of such a dramatic climatic swing is that the mud becomes frozen. The downside is that the mud becomes frozen. This is especially problematic if the gravel road that runs past your home has ruts that closely resemble utility trenches. Mud was a coveted playground material when I was a grade schooler. Kids – especially boys – were drawn inexorably to mudpuddles, as if crooning enchantresses were luring them into the shoe-snatching mire. A crop of carrots could have been raised in the mud that we tracked into the school. Our school’s janitor developed a severe facial tic whenever we tromped into the building after a muddy recess. An overnight Arctic blast would freeze the mud, preserving our tracks like so many fossilized dinosaur footprints. A paleontologist would probably have concluded that the creatures who left the tracks were small, hyperactive bipeds. During recess the boys played a game called kickball, a combination of soccer and “kill the carrier” except with fewer rules. Who am I kidding? There were no rules. A mob of shouting, wild-eyed boys were chasing the ball one recess when the playground had become a permafrost landscape of rugged ruts and treacherous tracks. The ball suddenly appeared before me. This was my chance! I would kick that ball so epically that it would be chronicled in my hometown newspaper six decades later! I was sprinting like a jackrabbit and lining up my kick when stars burst before my eyes. Looking around, I discovered that I was lying on the ground and that the side of my head had struck an especially jagged chunk of frozen mud. In keeping with the “no rules” rule of kickball, another boy had tripped me in the midst of my windup. Mud suddenly lost much of its appeal. So did kickball.
