Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:32 pm Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announces on Nov. 11 that there would be a full hand recount of ballots cast in the presidential race. ATLANTA — Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger shot down 2020 election conspiracy theories during a town hall call Thursday for District 8 residents in South Georgia. Despite claims of election fraud, falsely suggesting the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump, Raffensperger assured callers all votes were counted and recounted several times in the 2020 election — and the four people who cast ballots for dead people will be prosecuted. “It was alleged that there was 10,315 dead people that voted in Georgia,” Raffesnperger said. “I wrote a letter to Congress on Jan. 6, and I said there\'s two that we found. Since that time we found two more. Only four dead people voted in the state of Georgia. And so those people that assumed those identities will be brought before the state election board for prosecution and sent over to the Attorney General\'s Office."" A new death tracking system, Electronic Registration Information Center — which is used by more than 30 states— has been fully deployed in Georgia this year, he said. After an audit and two recounts — including a hand recount — of more than 5 million ballots cast during the November 2020 elections, an estimated 28,000 Georgians skipped voting in the Presidential race, but voted in other races on the same ballots, Raffensperger said. “That audit that we did, the hand recount, on all 5 million ballots proved two things. One is the accuracy of the machine, two is that the machines did not flip the votes and, also the results were what they were, that President Trump did come up short,” Raffesnperger said. Following the controversial election, Georgia lawmakers passed the Republican-led Voter Integrity Act this year. Several other Republican states have passed or are deliberating similar legislation. ""With the continued onslaught of Republican-led anti-voter efforts in Georgia and states across the country, our work protecting the freedom to vote could not be more urgent during this critical time for our nation and democracy,” said Cianti Stewart-Reid, new executive director of Fair Fight Action, a national voting rights organization founded by Democrat gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.

On the topic of absentee ballots, one caller during Raffensperger\'s town hall speculated that the state entered into a settlement agreement with voting rights activist, and now gubernatorial candidate, Abrams. Raffensperger said the agreement, “Signature Match Settlement Agreement,” was with the Georgia Democratic Party. “This agreement made sure that our signature matching requirements were in place both at the absentee ballot application phase and at the absentee ballot return stage when the voters sent their ballots back into the counties,” he said. “Activists groups have been suing us to eliminate signature matching and we beat that back.

columns that entertain you. It’s a tough job, but somebody needs to do it. Today, I write about our friends Down Under. Australia, that is, not Lower Alabama. Apparently political correctness isn’t as big a deal down there. Yet. I’ve been watching a show called “Rake” about an Australian lawyer and politician that is hysterical, but way too imprudent for many. However, this column is about Rangas. Yep, Rangas. What is a Ranga? A person with red hair. A caveat I assume you know; I am a redhead. In Australia, the slang name, “Ranga,” for redheads, comes out of orangutans, the primate. Known for its orange hair, dashing good looks, and sense of humor, which you know if you’ve seen “Every Which Way But Loose” and “Any Which Way You Can,” movies in which Clint Eastwood plays second fiddle to Clyde, an orangutan. A vastly underrated comedy movie twin-bill, the movies showcased orangutans as talented primates out for a good time. Apparently in Australia, redheads are considered in the same vein as orangutans by some, while others enjoy my sensibility of just laughing. According to “Crikey” magazine: “The word ranga first received wide exposure in 2007 when it was used in the first episode of the popular television comedy series ‘Summer Heights High.’ The context was schoolyard bullying: Doug: How is it OK for you to bully Ben? Jonah: ’Cause he’s a ranga. Doug: A what? Jonah: A ranga, sir. ’Cause he’s got red hair. Orangutan, that’s what we call him. Doug: And does that make it OK for him to be bullied, because he has red hair? Jonah: Well, people are racist to FOBs… Leon: To us. Jonah: So, so we can be racist to rangas. Doug: But redheads aren’t a race, Jonah. Leon: But sir, there’s heaps of them. They’re everywhere.” I don’t normally quote such long pieces, but that is funny, I don’t care who you are! The latest hullabaloo got started when the Adelaide Zoo (in Australia) had a promotion offering redheads free zoo admission because one day, we’ll all be extinct, like the orangutans. That’s a bit of a stretch, I know. No less an authority than “National Geographic” magazine says we redheads have at most, 100 years left. It’s based on climate change, as Nat Geo thinks the warmer temps are going to kill us pale-skinned carrot tops. I don’t have the time or space to point out Nat Geo’s long history of bad predictions, racism, bribery and fraud. In this modern world, with sunscreen, umbrellas and dermatologists at our beck and call, I’m confident redheads aren’t going to face extinction anytime soon. Julia Gillard, a former prime minister for the Aussies, is a redhead. She doesn’t take offense at the Ranga moniker, though enough Aussies did that the zoo canceled the promotion. Ms. Gillard was asked if blondes have more fun, and she replied, “No, I’m convinced redheads do, OK. Go the rangas!” Me? I’m with Ms. Gillard. Laugh it off. Have fun with it. People want to make fun of us because we are superior intellects, poets, writers, artists, singers, songwriters, lawyers, doctors, sheet metal mechanics and well, just generally superior human beings. If you aren’t a natural redhead, hair dye isn’t going to give you our superhuman traits, but maybe you’ll feel better. And that’s worth something.

Winds SE at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:10 pm According to a press conference held outside the Appling County Courthouse on Tuesday, January 26, one of Baxley’s very own announced candidacy for the Republican Governor seat held by Brian Kemp. Governor Kemp is serving his first term as Governor. Dr. Kandiss Taylor is a Baxley native and is currently employed as an educator with the Appling County Board of Education where she has been for the past 18 years. Dr. Taylor is the wife of Ryan Taylor who is also an educator, and together, they share three school-aged children. She is passionate about election voting reform, the economy, education, mental health, the working class, fair taxation, small business, gun rights, protecting life, and Georgia Grown. When asked what made her decide to run, she responded, “We have to have morality over money. Georgia has been in the National News in a negative way for the past several months, which has been embarrassing. I have been asked nonstop after my election in November to run for Governor. After much prayer and discussion with my husband and family, I decided to answer the call to be the leader of my beautiful native state.” Public service is not new to Dr. Taylor. She has served in a public school system as a 3rd grade teacher, school counselor, testing coordinator, student services coordinator, and homeless liaison. “The welfare, education, and safety of our children is of utmost importance to me. I want to see the focus of our government move to issues that matter and impact our daily life. It’s time to move away from the influence of special interest groups. I’ve been a conservative all of my life. I didn’t just decide to jump on this train. We need integrity that won’t be shaken in these seats,” she said. Dr. Kandiss Taylor says she is running to give Georgia an option that is conservative, fair, and working class. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

Brian Kemp has issued in response to the shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline. The Alpharetta-based company that supplies nearly half of the gasoline consumed on the East Coast reported a ransomware attack last Friday that forced a shutdown of a 5,500-mile pipeline running from Texas to New Jersey. The FBI blamed the attack on DarkSide, a group of hackers believed to operate out of Russia or Eastern Europe. To help relieve gasoline shortages brought on by the shutdown, Kemp issued an executive order Monday suspending federal regulations governing the number of hours commercial truck drivers can operate and waiving normal weight, height and length limits on trucks subject to state “oversize” permits. The order also suspends the collection of gasoline and diesel fuel taxes during the emergency and prohibits price gouging. Georgia governors have issued similar executive orders during other disruptions in fuel supplies, usually following hurricanes or other natural disasters that affect refineries or pipelines. The shutdown of the Colonial pipeline is expected to send pump prices higher and force refiners to cut production because they can’t transport the fuel. Kemp urged motorists not to panic. “There is no need to rush to the gas station to fill up every tank you have and hoard gas,” he said. “With the measures we have taken today, I am hopeful we can get more supply to stations and get through to this weekend when we hope Colonial will return to normal.” Colonial officials say they are working on “substantially restoring operational service” by the end of this week. Kemp’s executive order is due to expire at 11:59 p.m. Saturday. Read The Elberton Star, Elberton, Georgia The Elberton Star Mailing Address: P.O.

Eventually the owners, the Fuqua Family Trust, graciously gave the space to the city with the understanding the city would use it as a park. “We’re calling it the ‘Park on the Square’ for now,” said Pippin. “It will feature exposed brick walls, a canopy of steel beams overhead allowing for full view of the sky above, inviting spaces to rest or visit with friends amidst greenery and maybe a little art. “We are trying to preserve as much of the Fuqua building’s façade as possible, to preserve its history and assure it complements the wonderful stock of old, historic buildings in our downtown square,” said Pippin. “If all owners of downtown buildings will work together to preserve our historic landscape by using historic color palates, preserving brick detail and architectural features of the structures, coupled with our beautifully restored historic courthouse and the greenery around the square, we will create an outstanding Southern landscape second to no other city square in Georgia.” The city council agreed to pay up to $355,000 for the park, which includes removing the decaying floor and roof of the building and installing more than 60 steel support beams to keep the side walls from caving in. That is what the crane will be used for. “That is going to involve a large crane, and at some point will require us to block off Second Street for a period of time,” Pippin told the council at their Nov. 2 meeting. “The chief (Police Chief James Morgan) and I met with the construction company, and I learned that the crane is going to be so big that it will sit on Second Street and stretch to the very end of that building. “The crane will be there to remove beams and structures, but also to install 60+ plus steel beams in the building and on the sides to shore up those walls. It is very tedious work. The beams are steel and very heavy. A mishap could be disastrous, so that’s why we’re working with professional companies, insured companies that know what they’re doing.” Construction crews will begin work on the final demolition of the Fuqua building on Monday, Nov. 15, requiring the placement of dumpsters on Second Street and the closure of six parking spaces. A crane will arrive on Monday, Nov. 22, requiring the closure of Second Street between Oak and Mulberry Streets. The crane will be removed by the end of the day on Wednesday, Nov. 24, and will return on Monday, Nov. 29, if needed. “We regret the inconveniences the demo and construction will cause over these next few weeks,” said Pippin, “but everyone is requested to keep in mind that a beautiful, new park will be ready for use in early 2022!” The second project is a massive repair and renovation of the old New York Store building on the corner of Third and Oak streets by its owner. The building is getting a new roof and a complete façade restoration. “It, too, is going to involve a crane, but the big invasive part of the New York building is they are going to have scaffolding as tall as the building on both street sides. That will involve that whole corner of Oak and Third streets.” Chief Morgan said he spoke with the company doing the work and explained what will happen. “The scaffolding will be bolted together and rigged by a professional rigging company,” said Morgan. They’ll have a debris net that will keep debris from coming out toward the street and underneath. They’ll leave openings for the businesses there to transact business, and it will be safe for them because there will be an overhead board covering for pedestrians to walk under. “We will redirect the sidewalk traffic out into the parking area on the street and put up a barrier there. This will not pose too much of a problem on vehicular traffic. It might slow it down some, but we don’t see it closing the road unless we have to actually help getting the crane in place. The crane will be staged on Oak Street. I think it will go pretty quickly once they get it in place.” This construction will also begin on Nov. 15 with the erection of scaffolding on Third Street in front of the building. A crane will be set up on Oak Street alongside the building for one day only on Nov. 19. The scaffolding should be removed by Dec. 3.

Please join, you are needed. Father of Hope, As we wait, let us feel your breath upon us. We are not a people who wait in vain. We are not a people who will be defeated by exhaustion. We are not a people who wait in the dark. We will wait in the refuge of your hand. We will stand within your strength. We will shine our light to offer a path home. Lord we are aware we need your very blood to get us home. It is high price, but it is price already paid. We claim it as the only thing we have of worth. Yet, even in knowing our poverty, we are aware of our abundance. Help us Lord to accept your lavish gifts. Lord open us to the pouring over you desire to bestow upon us. We are so thirsty Father. We need to see your face Lord. We ache to feel your touch. Lord, you are invited. You are invited to show yourself in every space of our city, and especially in our Cherokee Street area. For the very land we cry out for your healing, your might. Lord raise a people to bring a strength, a wisdom and a courage for the residents in this area. And as you do, we will wait on you. We will wait, breathing the very breath you gave us.'}]"

year’s National Newspaper Week (Oct. 3 – 9) Indeed, there’s always been lots of “real” at newspapers. Real stories, real journalism, real work, real deadlines, real honesty, real facts, real changes and, now, real threats. This is the 81st annual National Newspaper Week, a time to reflect on the job of newspapers to keep all things “real” such as real conversation, real democracy, real science, real trade, real fact-sharing, real faith and real friends. Of course we hear lots these days about what’s not real— o-called fake news and alternative facts and the non-stop stream of internet-based noise, disruptions and misinformation. The job of newspapers in America, and especially for community newspapers in thousands of hometowns like ours, has never been more challenging — or more challenged. Once upon a time, newspaper circulation grew faster than the country’s population. In many places, newspaper subscriptions actually outnumbered total households. But since at least the 1980s, newspaper circulation in America has been on a steady and worsening decline. At the same time, newspapers remain the top choice for people seeking real news and reliable information. More than half of all Americans still subscribe or pay for newspapers or access to their websites. America’s newspaper audience exceeds today’s TV news watchers. Less than five percent of this audience tune into FOX, CNN or MSNBC, according to a recent National Newspaper Association survey. Just 11 percent of the survey’s respondents said the internet was their primary news source. Newspapers have survived the advent of radio and broadcast TV. But the threat of 24/7 internet-delivered media, commercials and amusement is disrupting the very reality for which newspapers were first invented. More and more people can’t tell the difference between real news and fake news. We use Facebook for faceless conversations, and we won’t accept that social media is very often anti-social. No amount of tweets will protect the public’s right to know or watchdog our government. A growing number of people, especially younger ones, think real news should be free and magically appear on their smart phones. Real journalists are losing their jobs because the old business model of newspapers is busted. Advertising revenues are declining faster than circulation at most newspapers, and hundreds of hometown papers have gone out of business in just the past few years. “Keeping it real” has become a rallying cry in newsrooms and news websites where journalists are trying to reinvent themselves and keep real news alive — and paid for. What is the future for newspapers? Cars are now driving themselves and keyboards are disappearing from computers and offices. In addition to newspapers, all news — including the real kind — is now being delivered to our phones or even via brain implants. Who knows what is next? The real matter here is not so much keeping newspapers real; rather it is keeping journalism real. Real news requires fact-checking, research, practice, trust-building and a devotion to truth, honesty and democratic decision making. Real newspapers were born in times before electricity and telegraphs. Real newspapers have witnessed and experienced changing realities, including the founding of this nation, world wars, space travel and personal computers, and next, robots and artificial intelligence. Whatever reality that newspapers next face to stay real and keep real news alive will require real readers and real revenues.

Hyperlocal news for metro Atlanta With Buckhead crime on the rise, it seems just about everyone in the neighborhood has crime-fighting ideas, from the kitchen-sink approach of the new “Buckhead Security Plan” developed by local organizations to a nonprofit’s call for separate cityhood. But discussion goes astray, says one criminologist, with some classic misperceptions, including crime fear that outpaces crime reality, and the notion that crime is a neighborhood-wide phenomenon rather than hyperlocal to specific blocks or buildings. And while many residents are demanding crime-fighting action from officials — including at a Jan. 4 City Hall protest — statistics show that many of them are ignoring the Atlanta Police Department’s pleas to help stop the easily preventable crime of car break-ins, by far the most common offense and one that sucks resources away from other police work. “Put simply, there’s a disconnect between where crime is occurring and the demographics most likely to be victimized, and the areas and demographic who have the highest levels of fear,” says Joshua Hinkle, a Georgia State University criminologist who specializes in evidence-based policing and fear of crime. While the crime rate has risen in Buckhead, he said, “crime and risk of victimization there are still way lower than in, say, the south part of the city where the real crime hot spots are concentrated in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods.” Research shows that middle-class suburbs tend to have higher crime fears than disadvantaged areas with higher crime rates, and vice versa, Hinkle said. And older women are the demographic most fearful of crime, while young males are the most likely to be victims of violent crime. With crime fear and crime reality existing somewhat separately, police work can be a victim of its own success. “In some studies, including one of my own, it’s found that police crackdowns may increase fear even if crime [or] disorder was successfully reduced,” Hinkle said. Maj. Andrew Senzer, the commander of Buckhead’s Zone 2 police precinct, has said in community meetings that local crime rates are rising in key violent and property categories, but well below other areas of the city. A review of the APD’s annual report for 2020 on the most common or serious incidents bears that out. The report is based on a standard list of charges long used for national crime reporting: larceny, auto thefts, burglary, aggravated assault, robbery, homicide and manslaughter. The 2020 stats show Zone 2 lower in numbers and percentages than the rest of the city in all violent crime categories. Squelching crime means understanding its causes, and that’s not easy on the current violent-crime wave. Buckhead and Atlanta are not alone in seeing a huge spike in shootings and killings, as cities nationwide are dealing with the same issues. “Pandemic, Social Unrest and Crime in U.S. Cities,” a report on 2020’s national crime rates produced by the Washington, D.C. think tank the Council on Criminal Justice, said the extraordinary year had some obvious effects, like burglary rates falling due to people staying home. Less clear is why homicides, aggravated assaults and gun assaults began increasing dramatically over 2019 numbers in late May. The timing coincides with the start of racial justice protests over the police killing of George Floyd, but criminologists in the report say it’s too soon to tell whether there is any connection. In Buckhead, discussion of crime often uses the term very broadly to mean everything from high-profile murder to illicit water-selling, and as something that occurs throughout the large neighborhood. But crime doesn’t work that way. “Crime problems, even in high-crime neighborhoods, tend to be very localized,” says Hinkle, “and what works on one block may not be applicable to the root causes of crime on another block in the same part of the city.” While residents often call for higher police visibility everywhere, the crime is in those “hot spots,” as the hyperlocalized crime sites are known. “There’s a very strong evidence base that hot-spots policing is more effective than purely random patrol,” said Hinkle. Cooling off a hot spot often does not involve police at all, but rather some other strategy, he said. Those strategies are at work in Zone 2. Senzer told the Buckhead Community Improvement District board on Jan. 27 that his officers are focused on two hot spots: the 2300 block of Peachtree Road and the Pharr Road corridor in Buckhead Village. And one of the tactics is bureaucratic, as city officials and investigators are checking on possible mis-licensed late-night businesses that they believe are among the root causes of violent crime. But most crime is not violent. “What’s really driving crime in Zone 2 is auto crimes…,” Senzer told the Buckhead CID. The APD stats show that auto theft and larceny from vehicles comprised around 63% of all Zone 2 crimes reported in 2020. That drives officers crazy because taking a theft report can burn a couple of hours and the crime is often easily preventable — most of the thefts involve unlocked vehicles with valuables inside, APD says. “During an eight-hour shift, depending on where you’re at, the day of the week, time of the year, all those kinds of things, you can easily take four or five reports like that in a day and it will take up your whole day,” said Officer Steve Avery, an APD spokesperson. The “Buckhead Security Plan” gained national press attention for proposing expanded and coordinated security patrols. Unmentioned was its boosting of APD’s “Clean Car Campaign” begging residents to stop making auto crimes so easy. Hinkle had a mixed view of the “Buckhead Security Plan.” The parts focused on hot-spot policing and crime-solving cameras look promising, he said, while “zero-tolerance” language refers to a crackdown style with a track record that is mixed on crime-fighting but clear on race and class bias, he said. Based on current research, Hinkle said, “the most promising police strategy would be one that applied problem-solving strategies to identify and target root causes of crime problems in long-term hot spots, coupled with community policing to help reduce fear and improve police-community relationships and collaboration.” –John Ruch with reporting and data analysis by Maggie Lee John Ruch is an Atlanta-based journalist.

Project SEARCH provides work experiences combined with training in employability and independent living skills to help participants with significant disabilities make successful transitions from school to productive adult life. Participation requirements include: — must be eligible for Vocational Rehabilitation services — must be 18-21 years old — must have a strong desire to work — must be entering the last year of school/training and be ready to enter the workforce at the conclusion of the program — must have good attendance — must have appropriate grooming and hygiene Participants receive job training at Ebenezer Middle School with the support of a certified special education instructor and skills trainer from the school district, a job coach from B&B Services and career guidance from Vocational Rehabilitation. They will develop skills in team building, workplace safety, technology, self advocacy, financial literacy, health and wellness, employment preparation and employment maintenance. “When Project SEARCH first started, it was at Effingham Hospital,” Project SEARCH instructor Jennifer Spitko said. “When COVID-19 hit, we moved it to Ebenezer Middle School and it’s awesome there. (Students) go through internships in the media center, the front office, the cafeteria, their’s custodial and they help with athletics. They go through the whole school and pick three internships to try through the year. “They are treated like staff.” Spitko said Project SEARCH has a high success rate. “It’s a really great program,” she said. “I have seen so many students who have grown so much doing it. I have a very rewarding job.” Benji Peth emerged from Project SEARCH six years ago. He has a reputation for outstanding custodial work at Marlow Elementary School. “I just like to help clean up,” he said. Peth also helps to keep the school atmosphere light and lively through a special talent. “I do voices,” he said before mimicking the comical sounds of Elmo of Sesame Street fame and Scooby-Doo. Peth, however, will take a no-nonsense approach with students if the situation requires it. “They know I am all fun and games but when it comes time to quiet down and it comes to my job — I am serious,” he said. Elijah Black is the epitome of seriousness. He arrives for work at the Effingham County Board of Education Central Office spiffily dressed. He’s been doing so for five years. “He is always neat as a pin,” Executive Director of Human Resources Susan Hartzog said. “He always does a great job and always speaks to everyone. He will do whatever we ask him to do.” Black’s duties include shredding documents and alphabetizing files. “It’s very rewarding to see students grow and wind up proud and independent,” Spitko said. “It makes their families proud, too.

Len Hauss. I can close my eyes and see the Yellow Jackets’ fullback, no. 41, piledriving Jesup to a 1959 state football championship. I can imagine hearing the shoulder pads pop as he blocked for the Georgia Bulldogs. And I’ll never forget the days when NFL players introduced themselves before televised games. Len Hauss put his hometown on the map. No. 56, the All-Pro center of the Washington Redskins, would say, with a grin, “I’m Len Hauss from Jesup, Georgia. I catch more redbreasts than anyone in the NFL.” Fifteen years ago, Gov. Sonny Perdue asked to go fishing in one of our lakes. I couldn’t go that day, but I arranged for the best fisherman I knew to be the governor’s guide, the retired captain of the ’Skins. Len and Sonny filled the boat. Len filled thousands of lives with inspiration, too. I am one of the many inspired by Len. Len and I met right here in First Baptist Church. On a Sunday morning in May 1957, the Rev. Floyd Jenkins baptized us both. As I stood on the baptism pool’s steps, I watched Brother Jenkins lift Len from the water. Then it was my turn. And during those years, my mother was First Baptist Church’s youth department director. Two of her favorite teenagers were Janis Johnson and Len Hauss. For as long as Mother lived, she’d reminisce about those days and smile. Mother and Len’s sister, Lenelle, team-taught an adult Sunday school class for years. The Hauss, Johnson and NeSmith families have loved each for more than 70 years. Thank you, Janis, for giving me this honor to remember Len. There are so many memories, like the time Len came to Athens for Charley Trippi Day. The event was organized by Loran Smith, who traveled with me today. Charley Trippi is arguably the most gifted athlete to ever play for the Georgia Bulldogs. On Dec. 14, Charley blew out every one of his 100 birthday candles. Charley was on Wally Butts’ 1960’s coaching staff when Len went to Georgia as a combination fullback and linebacker. During Charley’s special day, I listened to Charley and Len banter back and forth. Charley teased, “Lenny, you had a great NFL career. And that nice pension check you are drawing, well, I think you ought to share some of it with me.” Len stepped back and asked, “Coach, why would you say?” “Well, Lenny,” Charley said, “I was the one who convinced Coach Butts to switch you to center. You wouldn’t have made it in the pros as a fullback, but you were a great All-Pro center.” I can still hear Charley and Lenny laughing. Len Hauss and I shared two beloved mentors—Jimmy Sullivan and Dr. Lanier Harrell. For as long as Jimmy Sullivan lived, Len and I knew that Mr. Sullivan was always cheering for us. And there’s Dr. Lanier Harrell, a loyal listener and an irreplaceable source of wisdom. If Wayne County were to compile a list of legends, I’m sure Mr. Sullivan and Doc would agree. Let’s put Len at the top. And, Janis, I know Len would have agreed with me. Jimmy Sullivan and Doc would have to be on that list of legends, too. I never told Len this, but he was one of my boyhood heroes. Len and that championship team are why, as a skinny 122-pound freshman, I just had to be a Yellow Jacket. I wanted to play on the same field where Len Hauss earned All-America honors. There was no future for me in football, but I carried the value of teamwork into my future.

That experience is where I also learned the importance of having a backbone and the guts to stand up against all odds. For whatever success I have had or will have, I can thank Len for helping to inspire me to strap on a football helmet. In my generation, I know that am not alone in saying that. People die twice. First, the heart stops. Len Hauss’ heart stopped on Dec. 15. The second time a person dies is when the stories and the memories stop. Len Hauss, in his 79 years, left enough memories that his legend will never stop. What an inspiration. What a blessing. What a friend. Thank you, Len Hauss. dnesmith@cninewspapers.com Read Jesup Press Sentinel Jesup Press-Sentinel Mailing Address: 252 W.

Several employees wrote letters recognizing Deputy Brott for his hard work and dedication to the Sheriff’s Office, but especially recognized him for his hard work on our software transition. “Bruce came to us from another agency and had previous experience with the software system that we are implementing,” Sheriff Gulledge said. “He was a vital part of the software transition and helped teach other Deputies the system. We are extremely proud of the job that he does for the Sheriff’s Office and the citizens of Paulding County.” Deputy Brott was presented with a Certificate of Appreciation from the Board of Commissioners along with a “Dinner for Two” Gift Card from Texas Roadhouse.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 6:10 pm Surrounded by his family, senior Keith Robbins signs his letter of intent to play basketball at Belmont University Wednesday. The 6-foot-4 shooting guard will play his final season of high school basketball at John Milledge before making his way to Belmont in Nashville. Basketball has taken Keith Robbins many different places. Now the sport he loves is taking him to Nashville, Tenn. where he’ll be a Belmont University Bruin. Robbins, a 6-foot-4 shooting guard, signed to the Division I Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) school in front of friends and family Wednesday. After graduating high school, Robbins will join one of the country’s winningest men’s basketball programs in recent years. Led by head coach and Belmont alum Casey Alexander, the Bruins have won 12 of the last 16 regular season OVC titles, and they are one of just six DI programs to tally 50 wins or more over the last two seasons. Despite not playing in a “major” conference, Belmont men’s hoops is so well-respected that the team is receiving votes in the Associated Press Top 25 rankings. “It feels great and it’s a dream come true,” Robbins said on making his college destination official. “My family has made a lot of sacrifices to make this happen and I’ve put a lot of work in to get here. I’ve been playing basketball non-stop ever since I was about 5 or 6 years old, traveling back and forth from Milledgeville to Atlanta, and now it’s all paid off.” Robbins got his first look at Belmont in early June. He already had other college offers in hand, but the Nashville college was his first official visit on the recruiting trail. He wound up not needing to take any more. A couple days spent thinking and talking it over post-visit, he committed to becoming a Bruin. Belmont’s Coach Alexander had this to say once Robbins’ signing was made official Wednesday: “Our staff watched Keith play on many occasions and what stood out to us immediately was his versatility on both ends. His length, skill set, toughness and understanding will give us the flexibility to use him in a number of ways. Beyond that, now that we’ve spent a lot of time together with him, we know he’s a Belmont guy on and off the floor. We have great anticipation for his future at Belmont.” Robbins’ final landing spot worked out even though his varsity basketball career has been quite the winding road. He attended GMC Prep his freshman and sophomore years where he played under local coaching legend James Lunsford. Robbins was hurt most of his freshman year, but did get to play a full season as a 10th-grader when he averaged 14.8 points, six rebounds, four assists, over two steals and better than a block per game. That’s been his only full season of high school basketball to date. Robbins transferred to St. Francis near Atlanta his junior year, but was ruled ineligible about midway through the season with the GHSA citing his family’s dual residency as the reason. “That was one of the worst things to ever happen to me,” Robbins said candidly. “It wasn’t easy going through that with my family.” Rather than allow rust to accumulate once he was forced to sit out, Robbins continued to work and put his game on display in front of college coaches through his AAU program, Team Dickerson out of Atlanta. This year alone, he was named a top performer at 13 different AAU showcases, gaining him great exposure. Following the GHSA’s ruling of ineligibility, the standout player has returned to Milledgeville as he’s enrolled at John Milledge Academy for his senior year. The school’s Trojan Center, where he’ll play his final varsity season, is where he signed his letter of intent to Belmont Wednesday. Before heading north to Nashville, Robbins hopes to finish off his high school career the best way possible while competing with JMA head coach David Gallagher’s defending GISA AAA state champs. “I’m super excited to play in my hometown again and hopefully bring back another state championship this year,” said Robbins.

Betsoft and then young creators like the famous Quickspin. Born in 2011, this newcomer has created a place for itself among the best online casinos, thanks to a creative touch that is as fun as it is intoxicating. The vertical movements of the bubbles from below give an ambivalent impression. Whether the trees are sunk in water or a magical mist blankets the landscape, we can't be sure. What is certain is that this effect gives a beautiful aura of mysticism which is ultimately in line with the theme. The reels get a selection of classic symbols, mostly fruit, but you'll find they come with a retro design style borrowed from the 70s. They certainly don't look like classic fruit symbols, which is a plus for them . Diamonds, Lucky Seven, a golden bell, apples, plums, oranges and cherries will be the regulars. The function symbols are accompanied by the Pick Me and Wild logos. The Scatter symbols are the two Druids inhabiting the Enchanted Forest. Each time one of them appears on the reels with a stack of Wild symbols, the Wild Charge feature is activated. Once charged with Druid Magic, each Wild awards a Re-Spin and stays on the reels with the Scatter. If luck smiles on you, your bet is multiplied by the number shown on the box. If, for example, you place your bet on square 40 with your 500 chip, your win is calculated as follows: 40 x 500 = 20,000. Animating the game like any other professional animator, he activates a big wheel which stops after a few turns on a slice bearing a number by which the player's bet is multiplied. For their part, players place bets before each round and interact with the host live via the game interface. Net Entertainment (or NetEnt for short) is one of the most respectable, well-represented and influential video slot developers in the world. Created in 1996, this Swedish giant has since produced countless games covering all kinds of themes. While their competitors or would-be competitors try to find the niche, NetEnt plays on all fronts. Game conditions must also be met within the specified time. Only wagers placed on Slots, Keno and Scratch Cards contribute to the game requirements. Welcome bonuses may be subject to change, so please always check the promotions page and read all relevant terms and conditions. (Example: the wheel stops on the 7x space, then on 2x on the next spin, then the wheel designates the N°10. The gain is calculated as follows: 10 x 7 x 2 = 140. If you bet the 10 , so you get 140 times the amount wagered from the payout. The facilitator turns the big wheel which is made up of 54 segments representing the following numbers: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 40. The wheel has 54 segments with 6 numbers (1, 2, 5, 10, 20 or 40). Each number has a unique color. The host then spins the wheel and if it lands on your number, you win. Because of this simplicity, all types of people can have fun on Dream Catcher. Almost all live casinos are accessible on Android. Please note that Google does not allow real money games. For this reason, you will not find Dream Catcher live casino apps on Google play. To play Dream Catcher, which is only accessible with real money, you must connect to the live casino sites via your Android's chrome browser or another browser if possible. The Quickspin publisher offers around twenty different reel games: to hell with the quantity, with Quickspin, the perfection of its few games takes precedence over the choice it offers.

John Kennedy, R-Macon, chair of the Senate redistricting and reapportionment committee, urged his colleagues to approve the proposed House district map. The Senate approved the map 32-21 Friday, Nov. 12. Screenshot from Senate floor live video. ATLANTA — Georgia’s new House and Senate district maps for the next 10 years are on their way to final approval following party debates and public opposition to the Republican-led proposals. The Statehouse’s proposed 180 districts and state Senate’s proposal for its 56 districts now await a signature from Gov. Brian Kemp. State Sen. John Kennedy, R-Macon, said during the House Legislative and Congressional Reapportionment Committee meeting Nov. 10 that the map reduces the county plots from 39 to 30. The map, he said, has 14 majority-minority and six minority-opportunity districts. “As y\'all know, we probably know we currently have 34 Republican senators. It\'s a 34/22 split,” said Kennedy, chair of the Senate redistricting and reapportionment committee. “This map proposes basically to take us to 33 Republican Senate districts, and that\'s a recognition of the trends and changes that we\'re all seeing in politics but also making sure that we\'re in compliance and acting in good faith with the numbers that we\'ve seen.” Jana Grant, vice chair of Fair Districts Georgia — which partnered with Princeton Gerrymandering Project to generate more than 1 million potentially “fair maps,” said the groups graded the Senate map as an “F.” The Senate map falls outside of the groups’ benchmark that allows for 28 to 32 Republican districts and 24 to 28 Democratic districts on minority representation. “According to our analysis, the current state Senate map provides minorities 34 districts in which to elect candidates of their choice, 20 districts in which minorities are the majority and 14 minority influence districts,” Grant said. “The Senate map you\'re considering tonight maintains the 20 minority majority districts, but has one less minority influence district on competitiveness.” House committee chair Bonnie Rich said the House\'s proposed map has four sets of incumbent pairings: one pair of Democrat incumbents, two pairs of Republican incumbents and one Democrat-Republican pairing. Metro areas have seen a majority of the focus of district changes as metro areas have had more than half of the state’s growth in the last 10 years — particularly in minority populations. The Democrat incumbent pairing in the House proposal comes from Districts 106 and 102. “Why was it necessary to pair those two. I mean Gwinnett County is one of the fastest growing counties in the state and it should be large enough to add another district in the county,” said Senate Minority Leader Gloria Butler, a member of the Senate redistricting committee. Rich responded that another district (109) had been added to Gwinnett in the proposal. “If we just drew maps in Gwinnett County, then that may not have been a necessary pairing. But in trying to apply the guidelines, including respecting jurisdictional boundaries, the pairing was inevitable and I think it\'s pretty good that we ended up with only one Democrat and parent pairing,"" Rich said. ""I mean, as you see, we have more Republicans paired than we do Democrat so it certainly was not something that we tried to do or we actually tried not to; we tried to not pair incumbents wherever possible.” McDonough Mayor Patti Garrett said she did not support her city being represented by four representatives under the House redistricting proposal. District 109, which represents McDonough, is currently held by a Democrat. “We\'re a city of 4.7 square miles and 25,000 people,” Garrett said. “When I first saw the redistricting maps, I thought we\'d gone to three which we were supporting having one you know. It just makes sense for good governance for elections and for communities of interest to ... have fewer state representatives and certainly the population numbers don\'t really support that many members."" Rich said the House map — which received a ""B"" grade from the two nonpartisan redistricting groups — has 49 majority Black voting age population districts, which was an increase of only one district over the current House districts. ""In addition to the 49 of those voting rights districts, as we call them, we also drew 27, minority opportunity districts,"" Rich said. The current makeup of the Georgia House is 103 Republicans and 77 Democrats. The House map proposal was approved in the Senate 32-21, along Party lines. The House map proposal was approved in the Senate 32-21 on Nov. 12 along party lines. The Senate map approved in the House Nov. 15 in a 96-70 vote. The maps were poised to pass, as Republicans currently make up the majority on the committee during a time when more Georgia voters are voting Democrat; Kennedy also indicated there\'s an unwritten agreement among the chambers to not change the other chamber\'s proposal. ""They don\'t change and involve themselves in the process of deciding what senate districts will look like. They honor that process and pass our map,"" Kennedy said Friday before the Senate vote on the House map. ""We traditionally have done the same thing and I would ask this body to honor their work in presenting their map to us for our passage. ""However, we do have our own independent obligations and I think those are minimally to make sure that what they have sent us in this bill is constitutional, that it\'s legal, and that it\'s been and is involved in a fair process,"" Kennedy continued. ""And I will tell you that all three of those points are — absolutely yes. On the constitutional side. Our first responsibility, of course, is to balance the population under the U.S. Constitution and they have done that just as we did on our side."" The two chambers will now have to agree on Georgia\'s new congressional districts. The state\'s two U.S. senators were both elected Democrats in 2020, an election year that flipped Georgia, a historically Republican state, to a Democratic state. Currently, Georgia\'s U.S. representatives are nearly evenly split among parties, with six of the 14 seats held by Democrats. ""We are a 50/50 state. We are a battleground state,"" said Rep. Bee Nguyen in speaking against the Senate map Nov. 15. ""We are a swing state. This map tells us a different story. This map creates a 60/40 split with the advantage given to the Republican Party for the next 10 years."" Maps become effective upon Gov. Kemp\'s signature. On day five of the General Assembly\'s special session Tuesday, the House Legislative and Congressional Reapportionment committee approved the recommended new House district map for the General Assembly to consider. The Senate voted 32-21 in favor of the map on Nov. 12. Lt. Governor Geoff Duncan, Senator John F. Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Redistricting and Reapportionment Committee, and members of the Senate Majority Caucus released a proposed draft of Georgia’s Senate Districts on Nov. 2, the day before the start of Georgia\'s special session for redistricting.

Low 67F. Winds SE at 5 to 10 mph.. Cloudy. Low 67F. Winds SE at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:40 pm ATLANTA (AP) — Johnny Isakson, an affable Georgia Republican politician who rose from the ranks of the state legislature to become a U.S. senator known as an effective, behind-the-scenes consensus builder, died Sunday. He was 76. Isakson died in his sleep before dawn at his home in Atlanta, his son John Isakson told The Associated Press. He said that although his father had Parkinson\'s disease, the cause of death was not immediately apparent. ""He was a great man and I will miss him,"" John Isakson said. Johnny Isakson, whose real estate business made him a millionaire, spent more than four decades in Georgia political life. In the Senate, he was the architect of a popular tax credit for first-time home buyers that he said would help invigorate the struggling housing market. As chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, he worked to expand programs offering more private health care choices for veterans. Isakson\'s famous motto was, ""There are two types of people in this world: friends and future friends."" That approach made him exceedingly popular among colleagues. President Joe Biden, who served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with Isakson, said in a statement Sunday that he and the late senator ""found common ground built on mutual respect for each other and the institutions that govern our nation."" Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, on Sunday referred to Isakson as ""one of my very best friends in the Senate."" ""His infectious warmth and charisma, his generosity, and his integrity made Johnny one of the most admired and beloved people in the Capitol,"" McConnell said in a statement. In 2015, while gearing up to seek a third term in the Senate, Isakson disclosed that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson\'s, a chronic and progressive movement disorder that had left him with a noticeably slower, shuffling gait. Soon after winning reelection in 2016, he underwent a scheduled surgery on his back to address spinal deterioration. He frequently depended on a cane or wheelchair in later years. In August 2019, not long after fracturing four ribs in a fall at his Washington apartment, Isakson announced he would retire at year\'s end with two years remaining in his term. In a farewell Senate speech, he pleaded for bipartisanship at a time of bitter divisions between Republicans and Democrats. He cited his long friendship with U.S. Rep. John Lewis, an Atlanta Democrat and civil rights hero, as an example of two men willing to put party aside to work on common problems. ""Let\'s solve the problem and then see what happens,"" Isakson said. ""Most people who call people names and point fingers are people who don\'t have a solution themselves."" In his statement Sunday, Biden said, ""In Johnny\'s memory, let us heed the wisdom he offered upon retiring from the Senate."" Lewis, who died last year, saluted Isakson on the House floor in 2019, saying, ""We always found a way to get along and do the work the people deserve."" An Atlanta native, Isakson failed in his first bid for elected office: a seat on the Cobb County Commission in 1974. Two years later, he was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, becoming the only Republican to beat a Democratic incumbent in Georgia the same year Jimmy Carter was elected president. Isakson served 17 years in the state House and Senate. Always in the minority in Georgia\'s General Assembly, he helped blaze the path toward the GOP ascendancy of the 2000s, fueled by Atlanta\'s suburban boom. By the end of Isakson\'s career, some of those same suburbs were swinging back toward Democrats. ""As a businessman and a gifted retail politician, Johnny paved the way for the modern Republican Party in Georgia, but he never let partisan politics get in the way of doing what was right,"" Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said in a statement. Isakson suffered humbling setbacks before ascending to the Senate. In 1990, he lost the race for governor to Democrat Zell Miller. In 1996, Guy Millner defeated him in a Republican primary for Senate before Millner lost to Democrat Max Cleland. Many observers chalked up the loss to Isakson not being tough enough on abortion. In the primary race, Isakson ran a television advertisement in which he said that while he was against the government funding or promoting abortion, he would ""not vote to amend the Constitution to make criminals of women and their doctors."" ""I trust my wife, my daughter and the women of Georgia to make the right choice,"" he said. He later changed his mind on the contentious issue. Isakson\'s jump to Congress came about in 1998, when U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich decided not to seek reelection. Isakson won a 1999 special election to fill the suburban Atlanta seat. He finally made it to the U.S. Senate in 2004 when he defeated Democrat Denise Majette with 58% of the vote. He served with Georgia senior Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a close friend and classmate from the University of Georgia. Isakson was viewed as a prohibitive early favorite to succeed Republican Sonny Perdue in the governor\'s mansion in 2010. But he opted instead to seek a second term in the Senate. While there, he developed a reputation as a moderate, although he rarely split with his party on key votes. He was a lead negotiator in 2007 on immigration legislation that President George W. Bush backed but ultimately abandoned after it met strong resistance from the right. Isakson supported limited school vouchers and played a major role in crafting Bush\'s signature education plan, the No Child Left Behind Act. He also pushed an unsuccessful compromise bill on the politically charged issue of stem cell research that would have expanded research funding while also ensuring that human embryos weren\'t harmed. That deal-making approach has fallen out of favor for many voters, but Isakson\'s lineage remains a presence in Georgia politics. State Attorney General Chris Carr was the former senator\'s chief of staff. ""When I was a young man just getting started in politics, I wanted to be like Johnny Isakson,"" Carr said Sunday. Democratic Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock said ""all of Georgia"" grieves Isakson\'s death. Warnock, who took over Isakson\'s old seat after defeating Republican Kelly Loeffler in a January runoff, had a special connection to Isakson, who attended an annual service in honor of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. The church\'s pulpit was King\'s and later became Warnock\'s. Isakson\'s ""model of public service is an example to future generations of leaders on how to stand on principle and make progress while also governing with compassion and a heart for compromise,"" Warnock said Sunday. Isakson graduated from the University of Georgia in 1966 and joined his family-owned company, Northside Realty in Cobb County, a year later. It grew to one of the largest independent residential real estate brokerage companies in the country during his more than 20 years at the helm. Isakson also served in the Georgia Air National Guard from 1966 to 1972. He is survived by his wife, Diane, whom he married in 1968; three children and nine grandchildren. ___ Bynum reported from Savannah, Georgia. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

Low around 65F. Winds light and variable.. Mostly cloudy skies. Low around 65F. Winds light and variable. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:09 pm Jeremy Malone One minute they’re giving you grateful hugs. The next they’re breaking your finger. Such has been the life for Forsyth police Cpl. Jeremy Malone over the past few days. Malone went to help a Forsyth woman who called police from a shot house at 252 Kynette Street who couldn’t find her keys. The call came in around 9:15 p.m. on Dec. 12. According to the report, Sonya Bowden of Forsyth told Malone she wanted to leave but was unable to find her keys. Malone noted they would not let him into the shot house to look for her keys. She told him they had already looked inside but could not find them. Malone checked the area but was unsuccessful and said he could not do much more for her. Bowden appeared to be drunk so he offered her a ride home so she could try again in the morning. While talking with her, Malone kept hearing a jingling sound and after a few seconds, saw her keys were clipped to her bra strap. Bowden was extremely happy to have found her keys and wanted to drive home. But Malone told her she wasn’t in a condition to drive. After talking with him for a minute, she decided to let him give her a ride. He took her home and when she got out, she became emotional while thanking him and started crying and hugging him. He made sure she was ok and walked her to her door where she was able to go inside safely. Two weeks later, on Christmas Day, Malone wasn’t so well received. Around 10:53 p.m., Malone was patrolling Forsyth Gardens when he saw a group in front of the F building. As he got closer, he noticed someone lying on the ground. He began walking toward the group and heard several people yelling “stop, it’s the police!” as he approached. He then realized two people were tussling on the ground and rushed to the fight. The man on the bottom, Brendan Scott, kicked at Malone’s face and Malone narrowly dodged the blow by leaning back and catching Scott’s leg as it passed. Malone then tried to roll Scott over so he could be handcuffed but the person on top of Scott was preventing the cuffing and Malone told him to get off. Scott then began throwing punches at Malone which he dodged and blocked. Malone nearly had him cuffed when he lost the cuffs on the ground during the fight. They tussled on the ground a few seconds longer and Scott got up and ran but slipped and Malone quickly tackled him to the ground. Scott continued swinging at Malone who realized his right pinky was hurt. Due to the injury, Malone decided to pin Scott to avoid further injuries. Malone tried to call for help on his radio during the fight, but it was knocked off and got wrapped around Scott. Malone also lost his body camera but was able to find his radio mic and called for help. Meanwhile, people were surrounding them, and Malone felt several people pulling on him and his gear from different directions. He then asked for help in emergency mode. Others were trying to attack Scott while Malone was holding him down and he had to keep telling them to stop and back off. Malone was struck several times during the fight but was unsure if it was Scott or others around him as well. Forsyth officer John Bogdan soon arrived and helped handcuff Scott. Shortly after, officer Anais Benjamin and several Monroe County deputies arrived. Deputies took Scott to a patrol car while Malone spoke to Porsha Scott, Scott’s sister, the complainant. She said her brother went to her home at apartment F3 and was acting “crazy.” She said he was yelling and trying to fight people and at one point, poured beer all over himself. Ms. Scott stated that Scott then kicked her 1-year-old child in the head and that was when others stepped in. Ms. Scott also said that someone tried to stop Scott and they went to the ground. While standing at the patrol cars trying to get Scott into the vehicle, Clymeria Watts went to the cars and began trying to keep the officers from dealing with Scott. Malone and the deputies kept telling her to back away while they were dealing with the scene, but Watts refused to obey. A deputy then handcuffed her for not listening and repeatedly walking up to the patrol car. Bogdan charged her with obstruction and took her to the Monroe County Jail. Scott was jailed for felony obstruction and cruelty to children. EMS checked Malone’s hand and took him to the Monroe County Hospital. It was determined that his bone was chipped during the fight.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 5:20 pm Globular clusters are roughly spherical collections of extremely old stars, and around 150 of them are scattered around our galaxy. Hubble is one of the best telescopes for studying these, as its extremely high resolution lets astronomers see individual stars, even in the crowded core. The clusters all look very similar, and in Hubble’s images it can be quite hard to tell them apart – and they all look much like NGC 411, pictured here. And yet appearances can be deceptive: NGC 411 is in fact not a globular cluster, and its stars are not old. It isn’t even in the Milky Way. NGC 411 is classified as an open cluster. Less tightly bound than a globular cluster, the stars in open clusters tend to drift apart over time as they age, whereas globulars have survived for well over 10 billion years of galactic history. NGC 411 is a relative youngster — not much more than a tenth of this age. Far from being a relic of the early years of the Universe, the stars in NGC 411 are in fact a fraction of the age of the Sun. The stars in NGC 411 are all roughly the same age, having formed in one go from one cloud of gas. But they are not all the same size. Hubble’s image shows a wide range of colours and brightnesses in the cluster’s stars. These tell astronomers many facts about the stars, including their mass, temperature and evolutionary phase. Blue stars, for instance, have higher surface temperatures than red ones. The image is a composite produced from ultraviolet, visible and infrared observations made by Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3. This filter set lets the telescope “see” colours slightly further beyond red and the violet ends of the spectrum. The current mystery in astronomy is dark matter. Billions of dollars in research funds are spent, and many astronomers study this all-consuming mystery. Since 1884, astronomers have realized the motion of galaxies suggests there is unseen matter in the universe. Over time, astronomers began to suspect this wasn’t simply material that we couldn’t see, but something entirely different. Astronomers madly search for dark matter without knowing its exact nature. It’s the hot mystery in astronomy and physics today. The dark matter mystery overshadows a second mystery, a mystery as old as dark matter. Stars collect in clusters. Gas and dust collect in great clouds, some glowing and some unseen. All this collects into massive assemblies called galaxies, and galaxies collect in clusters of galaxies. These collections are held together by gravity. Another collection, and one of my favorites to observe, are globular clusters. Globular clusters are at the heart of the second mystery. These spherically shaped clusters contain a hundred thousand to a million stars. Their name derives from the Latin globulus, “a small sphere.” Nearly all galaxies have globulars. They are as old as the host galaxy itself. They are low in heavy elements because they formed early in the universe’s history. Over 150 globulars reside in the Milky Way, and they are scattered in its outer fringes. A few are observable in binoculars, but their great distance makes them appear like “a small sphere.” The Milky Way’s sister, the Andromeda galaxy, contains over 500 globulars. Some giant galaxies have over 10,000 globulars. How globulars form is not fully understood. Galaxies typically flatten into disks or at least a highly oval shape because of the spin in the initial clouds of gas from which their stars formed. Globulars don’t flatten into a disk because they have little spin. The mystery is why not? Everything in the universe spins; planets, our solar system, stars, and galaxies. Why not globular clusters? That is the mystery. Maybe, just maybe, understanding this mystery would be a clue to understanding dark matter. This image of a globular cluster in the Milky Way was taken using the Hubble Space Telescope and released in 2013 by NASA. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

Till Next Time, Georgia Southern Pro-Palestinian Rallies held on Georgia Southern Campuses Credit: @blessedhandsbarbershopboro on Instagram Jahvarius KendrickJanuary 26, 2021 At about 8 o’clock in the morning, in a medium size room, you see two barbers getting ready for the day. One barber is already cutting hair on his client, and another is setting up equipment for her appointment. As you try to walk inside you are prevented from coming straight in, you get stopped and scanned with a forehead temperature scanner before you go inside. But as you walk inside you hear the sounds of clippers buzzing, the casual conversations between the clients and the barbers and even the sound of a TV playing in the background. Although there is hardly anyone here, there is still a social atmosphere that you can feel by being in the shop. It reminds you of life before the pandemic. As you get comfortable, you hear the door get locked behind you and see other customers have to go through the same routine, reminding you that the pandemic is still so nearby in our new normal. This is an average morning at Blessed Hands barber shop. While some mornings may not start this early, this is how life has been during the pandemic. More masks and social distancing, less crowded barbershops, all for the safety of both the barbers and their customers. O the Barber The first barber that I interviewed went by the name O the Barber, and she shared how the pandemic had affected her in her personal life. “I had a best friend back home, and his uncle passed away from COVID,” said O, “We [were] at his house doing a low country boil, and the next week we got a phone call saying that he was in the hospital and passed away.” Home for O is about an eight-and-a-half hour drive back to Jackson, Mississippi. O ended up coming to Statesboro when Georgia Southern’s track coach insisted that she come for a visit, and she’s been here ever since. During her time on the GS track team, O started to become more involved with barbering, and she started pitching herself to other athletes. “A lot of times when we [were] in the training room, I would just tell them, ‘Hey man, let me cut your hair.’” O later detailed what her method was to cutting hair and how her style may be different from other barbers. In this case her client wanted a box haircut. “I fade down. When I first started cutting hair, I used to fade up, but I used to have issues because when I would run in to the bulk, I’d run out of room,” said O. “So when you go in, basically, you take your one-and-a-half up top, and you create your separation between your sides and the top, and you fade down from there.” O’s method of cutting hair was enough for her clients, and even some of her former teammates, to keep coming back. On the day of our interview, O had been in contact with former track and field teammate Samantha Cook about a new change in her hairstyle. O, of course, obliged. Samantha Cook Cook, a fifth grade math teacher, detailed the reason for her interest in getting a new haircut. “I actually decided to do a big cut. Like I said, I had the baby, and I’m ready to make a change.” Cook had her son in the middle of the pandemic, and she spoke candidly about her pregnancy experience during that time. “Just doing the pregnancy alone was hard,” said Cook, “And then of course I didn’t get to celebrate the baby shower, nothing, so it was really hard because you’re supposed to have this wonderful time in your life, and I got it taken away.” Cook has also had to get used to working remotely during the school semester. Cook works for Georgia Cyber Academy, an online school that has started to gain traction in Georgia. Despite the students being online, Cook’s class attendance can still be spotty for various reasons. “I can have a class of 40 and maybe 20 will be there participating, and there is nothing really we can do about it.” Cook also detailed how it has been dealing with parents during the pandemic and their concerns for their child’s education. “I get emails from 8 a.m. until nine at night. Parents are always in my inbox. If they can’t get a hold of me [through] email, they’ll call me because I have my zoom open 24 hours a day,” said Cook. “They are very vocal because they want their kids to get their education, and they are very vocal if the kids are struggling. What else can they do? I’m really big on making sure they know I’m there.” At the end of our conversation Cook finally revealed what her new haircut was going to be: a skin-fade underneath her long hair. Junior The next barber that I interviewed at Blessed hands went by the name of Junior. Before he officially became a barber, Junior was cutting hair while incarcerated and was wondering what he would do for work once he got released. “I used to cut hair while I was locked up with a comb and razor,” said Junior, “In my last bid, I was like, man, what was I going to do when I get out?” said Jr. “I remembered I had clippers, and me and one of my partners sat down and dissected the barber game, and I was like, ‘Sounds good. Hell, I’ma give it a try.’” Junior also revealed that his 14-year-old son caught COVID-19 and had moderate symptoms for about two weeks before finally getting back to normal. Junior’s initial reaction to his son contracting the virus was of concern, but it also let him know just how real the virus was. “That let me know that it was real,” said Junior, “It hit home. I was like that s— really real.” Because of his son’s contraction of COVID-19, Junior took two weeks off, and his son went back to go live with his mom to quarantine. During this time, Junior went to get tested for COVID before eventually returning back to work once his results were negative. “When I got my results back, I caught back up, letting people know everything was good,” said Junior. James As I was finishing up my interview with Junior, I noticed a barber in the shop that I still had not interviewed. I had asked him earlier in the morning, but he did not want to do it. However, after a little bit of coaxing from the other barbers in the shop, he eventually warmed up to the idea, making jokes about how he wasn’t good in front of the camera. “[I] opened [Blessed Hands] in July of last year,” said James. To my surprise, I had unknowingly ran into an interview with the shop owner. Once he noticed that I was unaware he chuckled and continued to tell his story. James opened up Blessed Hands barber shop with another barber named Monty, who had been cutting hair with James for about five years. The two were cutting hair with Kingdom Cuts, a barbershop that was close by GS’ campus, before they eventually opened up the shop that I was currently in, Blessed Hands. James originally started barbering when he was in middle school, learning how to cut from his brother-in-law. He became more interested in barbering after his uncle had a stroke. “He couldn’t do nothing for himself, so I picked up the clippers, had to cut his hair, had to shave him.” After a period of time, James moved away from Georgia until he came back in 2007. The transition was like he was starting back over again. “Had to start off like I was a new barber, like I wasn’t from around here,” said James. “I had to get out. We call it beat the streets, telling them where you work at, you know, promote yourself.” After a while, James was able to get his name out in the Statesboro community and he began to gain more clients. While people are still trying to get adjusted to our new normal because of COVID-19, the pandemic hasn’t kept things down at Blessed Hands. When asked just how well his business is doing, James grinned up under his mask. “I plead the fifth. Everybody eating.” Editor’s note: This story was written for a class by Jahvarius Kendrick who is not a member of our staff. The George-Anne has decided to publish his story.
