EAST LANSING – After seven days of rest, the Michigan State men’s basketball team opened up Big Ten conference play against the No. 23 Wisconsin. The Badgers shocked the Spartans in a 70-57 win at the Breslin Center. MSU has fallen to 4-4 on the season, a loss that MSU head coach Tom Izzo took full responsibility for. “We’re not tough enough right now and that’s all me, so blame me, not the players,” Izzo said. The Badgers came out strong, as junior forward Stephen Crowl and junior guard Chucky Hepburn’s three-pointers gave the Badgers an early 9-2 lead. After the slow start, the Spartans ended the scoring slump with a Jeremy Fears and-one layup and a three-pointer from Tre Holloman cut the Wisconsin lead to 13-8 with under 12 minutes to play in the first half. The Badgers, however, fired right back, as a 7-0 run made it 20-8 with sophomore guard AJ Storr leading the way. Whenever it seemed like the Spartans had momentum and were getting back into the game, the Badgers fired right back as they headed into halftime with a 34-23 lead, ending the half on a 6-0 run. AJ Storr led the Badgers with 12 points shooting 2-for-2 from three-point range. Stephen Crowl also contributed with 11 first-half points shooting 3 for 3 from three-point range. MSU struggled to guard the perimeter, allowing six Wisconsin three-pointers in the first half, and had seven first-half turnovers, as the Badgers scored 12 points off MSU turnovers. “They were physical, they were tough. Give [Greg] Gard and his team a lot of credit, they played well, I thought they defended really well,” said Izzo. In the second half, the Spartans cut the deficit to eight, with senior guard Tyson Walker and senior guard AJ Hoggard leading the way for MSU as the Badgers led 40-32 four minutes into the second half. AJ Hoggard and Tyson Walker continued the offensive momentum, with a plethora of three-pointers to cut the deficit to 47-43. The back-and-forth play continued as the Badgers led the Spartans 56-50 with under eight minutes to play. After both teams went scoreless for over a minute, AJ Storr’s three-point field goal increased the Badgers’ lead to 59-50 with 6:06 to play. Down the stretch, MSU’s offensive struggles allowed the Badgers to capitalize on offense, with three-point shooting and second-chance points, leading to an impressive Big Ten victory. Offensive rebounding continued to be an issue for MSU, giving up 11 offensive boards, along with giving up 19 second-chance points. “That shouldn’t happen to us, and it’s my fault because I’m getting soft,” said Izzo AJ Storr led the Badgers with 22 points, while Steven Crowl also contributed with 18 points. Tyson Walker led the Spartans with 22 points, with 16 of those points coming in the second half on 9-of-20 shooting in the loss. The Spartans will next travel on the road to Lincoln on Sunday, Dec. 10 to take on the Nebraska Cornhuskers.

Using data to look toward the future, the DNR predicts that 434,000 people will purchase a deer hunting license in 2030. This represents a 25% decline from the number of licensed hunters in 2019. The current and projected declines are part of a national trend, with very few exceptions, especially when looking at states that have experienced little to no population growth in decades, like Michigan.

DTE Energy says it may take months before the Fermi 2 nuclear power plant returns to full power because of substantial repairs needed on a reactor water pump. DTE Energy has shut down its Fermi 2 nuclear power plant near Monroe because of an excess of hydrogen gas in a cooling system for the main electrical generator. The Fermi 2 Nuclear Power Plant returned to service Friday when operators synchronized the plant to DTE Energy\'s electrical system, following a safe, successful refueling and maintenance outage that began March 26. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission says a weeklong shutdown in September at Palisades nuclear power plant in southwestern Michigan was caused by workers and supervisors not following proper safety procedures. Federal regulators are investigating an accidental shooting involving a security officer at Michigan\'s Fermi 2 nuclear power plant. Officials at Fermi 2 Nuclear Power Plant said they have notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that they intend to apply for renewal of Fermi 2\'s operating license.

Thyroid cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the thyroid. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. The thyroid produces hormones that regulate heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and weight. Thyroid cancer might not cause any symptoms at first.

On Friday morning Fox 17 Meteorologist Haleigh Vaughn shared on her Facebook page the personal news of her Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis. It didn't take long for West Michigan to show love and support for Haleigh as she recovers from surgery. Just like everyone else, I'm hoping for a fast and speedy recovery for Haleigh.

Fish, who joined in 2012 and has been a big part of their success over the last decade. Fans are pretty bummed and for good reason, expressing dismay over Fish\'s departure while showing gratitude for all he\'s done for the band during his 11-year tenure. Still, people can be pretty dramatic and some fans feel entitled to know the exact reasoning for this decision, simply because they\'ve supported the band through the years. Bring Me the Horizon issued a statement this morning (Dec. 22), informing fans they had split with Fish. The keyboardist reshared this statement, noting that he is ""grateful"" for his time in the group and wishes them well while looking forward to his own future. With such vague, generalized statements from each party, fans are dying to know more details. A band\'s internal dynamics are very private and what goes on behind the scenes are often kept out of view of the public eye. What this means is there\'s drama that goes on all the time that we\'re never aware of and if the band wants to keep matters private, that\'s up to them. It\'s natural to be curious, but one fan took a moment to remind everyone ""we\'re not entitled to know their reasoning,"" in response to some outcries that were observed. Fans had suspected something was up last week regarding Fish\'s status in the band. Now that a statement has arrived, some are disgruntled that it didn\'t say all they had hoped it would.

'(JERUSALEM) — National security adviser Jake Sullivan touched down in Israel on Thursday with a blunt message from the Biden administration imploring the Israeli government to lower the intensity of its sweeping military campaign in Gaza as soon as possible, U.S. officials told ABC News. The officials said that the administration will stand behind Israel as it seeks to destroy Hamas but that it expects the country’s strategy to pivot from an all-out assault and toward more targeted, tactical operations aimed at eliminating Hamas’ leaders and hideouts, as well as recovering hostages. White House spokesperson John Kirby declined to set any specific timeline for the transition during a Thursday press briefing but said that Sullivan discussed it happening “during the near future” during his face-to-face meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the other members of Israel’s war cabinet. Kirby said that Sullivan also reiterated U.S. support for Israel and the administration’s commitment to bringing home the scores of hostages still held by Hamas during his meeting with Netanyahu, but that he also “asked hard questions” about the next phase of Israel’s offensive and “discussed efforts Israel is now undertaking to be more surgical and precise in their targeting.” President Joe Biden also said Thursday that he wants Israel to “be more careful” with their attacks in Gaza and be focused on “how to save civilian lives” as casualties continue to climb. “I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives, not stop going after a Hamas, but be more careful,” he said during an event at the National Institutes of Health on Thursday. The president was asked whether he wanted Israel to scale back its assault on Gaza by the end of the year as reported by The New York Times and move to a lower intensity phase, but he did not address that question. Israeli officials have not yet publicly commented on their engagements, but local press reports claimed that Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Sullivan that Israel still needed months of war to stamp out Hamas. Differing outlooks on how long the full-blown fighting should last is just one potential threat to the coalition between the U.S. and Israel. Growing international and domestic backlash to the conflict have also tested the Biden administration’s resolve. A senior State Department official said that in previous closed-door meetings with U.S. officials, Israel has given vague forecasts regarding how long its campaign will take but that its initial operations in the northern Gaza were completed faster than both countries originally anticipated. A principal counselor to the president, Sullivan is one of a handful of top-level Washington officials that have been traveling to the Middle East at a routine clip in the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack as the administration attempts to both demonstrate support for Israel and rein in its retaliation, while also seeking to cool tempers in neighboring countries to prevent the conflict from escalating into a regional war. Senior officials say that each leg of the administration’s shuttle diplomacy strategy has been driven by a clear goal, such as convincing the Israeli government to allow desperately needed aid into Gaza or to implement humanitarian pauses in the warfare. The administration’s push for precision in Israel’s military operations comes days after Biden delivered some of his harshest criticism for Israel’s battle tactics to date, remarking at a campaign fundraiser that the country was beginning to lose international support due to “the indiscriminate bombing that takes place,” according to a White House transcript. While the U.S. hasn’t launched any investigation into whether Israel may have committed war crimes in Gaza, administration officials have publicly expressed their dismay at the large numbers of casualties suffered in the enclave. More than 18,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. More than 1,200 people were killed in Israel during Hamas’ attacks, according to the Israeli prime minister’s office. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Wednesday said he believed Biden was speaking about Israel’s “large-scale bombing campaign that we’ve seen where thousands of civilians have been killed.” “We’ve seen too many civilians killed,” he added. The staggering death toll has riled other countries in the region — including Saudi Arabia, which was previously on a track toward establishing diplomatic ties with Israel, a development the Biden administration says would be instrumental in ensuring long-term peace for the Middle East. Ahead of his visit to Israel, Sullivan stopped in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, where he met with Prime Minister and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss a number of issues, “including ongoing efforts to create new conditions for an enduring and sustainable peace between Israelis and Palestinians,” according to the White House.

a complaint in the Michigan Court of Claims on Tuesday seeking to bar Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson from disqualifying him from the 2024 presidential ballot. Former President Donald Trump arrives at a commit to caucus rally, Sunday, Oct. 29, 2023, in Sioux City, Iowa. This week, Donald Trump filed a complaint in Michigan’s Court of Claims seeking to stop efforts in the state to disqualify him from the 2024 presidential ballot. Plaintiffs in the pending cases argue that Trump’s actions surrounding the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol amount to an attempted insurrection, or rebellion, that disqualifies him under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It’s just the latest in a series of battles taking place in the courts – both in Michigan and nationally – exploring whether or not the Amendment precludes the former president’s candidacy. Law professors David Orentlicher and Richard Broughton joined Detroit Today on Thursday to share their insights on the lawsuits and the ethical and political concerns that surround them, along with Mark Brewer, an attorney representing the plaintiffs in one of the cases seeking to bar Trump from the 2024 ballot. GUEST: Mark Brewer is a partner and attorney at the Goodman Acker law firm. He represents plaintiffs in a case seeking to disqualify former president Donald Trump from appearing on the 2024 ballot, and believes Trump should be disqualified from appearing on the Michigan ballot in 2024 because he violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. “Donald Trump has violated this rule that says not only can he not run for president, but he can never run or serve in public office again,” says Brewer. “That’s how serious it is to engage in an insurrection to try to overthrow the government of the United States.” David Orentlicher is a Law Professor at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. He says if Trump’s involvement in the January 6th storming of the capital is interpreted as “engaging in an insurrection”, that rule would be applied too broadly. “If you use this definition, it would apply to Trump, and others that participated in the January 6th violence, but also to those who use force to resist governmental authority for any reason,” says Orentlicher. Richard Broughton is law professor at the University of Detroit-Mercy and a U.S. Constitution expert. He says the purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment is to prevent individuals who have betrayed their oath to the constitution from serving in public office. “If you have taken an oath to support the constitution and then you have betrayed that oath, you shouldn’t be allowed to serve in public office,” says Broughton.

Last week, GOP Chairwoman Kristina Karamo filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Michigan Republican Party against a trust that control’s the party’s former Lansing headquarters. As reported by the Detroit News, the lawsuit filed in Ingham County Circuit Court effectively pits Karamo against a group of former party leaders and longtime donors who govern the trust — 11 months before the November 2024 presidential election. The filing was made after a bank warned the party last month it was in default on a more than $500,000 line of credit, with hopes that the state GOP could regain ownership of the downtown Lansing building in order to sell it to help pay down the debt. Now, state Republican Party leaders in two of Michigan’s largest counties are pushing for Karamo’s removal as chairwoman of the state’s GOP. So what is at the root cause of all this chaos within the Michigan Republican Party and why are some of its members seeking to oust Karamo? Oakland County Republican Party Chairman Vance Patrick, Michigan GOP state committee member Bree Moeggenberg and Detroit News reporter Craig Mauger joined Detroit Today on Monday to discuss. Guests: Vance Patrick is a chairman of the Oakland County Republican Party. He wants to remove Kristina Karamo as chair of the state party. He says the discord in the Republican Party is so bad, the party chair issued an ill-conceived lawsuit in order to get desperately-needed money. “You can’t make this stuff up,” said. Patrick. Bree Moeggenberg is a committeewoman for District 2 of the state Republican Party, which includes Mount Pleasant. She says the party needs to come together to build a coalition between moderates and Trump-supporting Republicans. “They have to be willing to build a leadership team of every single faction,” said Moeggenberg.

You may remember Toldo as Leslie LoBue when she landed in the area as a Meteorologist and medical reporter at Flint\'s WJRT-TV (ABC-12) in July of 2004. She changed her on-air name to Leslie Toldo after getting married and left the ABC affiliate unceremoniously after nearly 10 years in May of 2014. She joined WEYI-TV and WSMH-TV (now collectively known as Mid-Michigan Now) about a year later and is a frequent contributor to \'My City\' magazine. Toldo has also worked at television stations in Detroit, Jackson, Mississippi, and Casper, Wyoming, according to her LinkedIn page. If you\'ve followed her on social media, you are likely aware that she\'s an animal lover as well as a wedding and funeral officiant. As of this publication, the journalist has not yet announced what she\'ll be doing in the future, but indicates on Facebook that she\'ll be staying in the area, saying she ""will continue to work, play, and contribute here."" We reached out to Toldo, and when queried by co-anchor Mike Woolfolk during her last newscast this morning (Jan 2), she remained tight-lipped about her next career move. In the video below, Toldo hints that we\'ll soon know what she\'s up to quipping, ""I\'ll be making an announcement this week about where I\'m going and what I\'m doing and all that junk."" Stay tuned.'}]"

Voices in the green movement, that has been sweeping across the globe, have raised the red flag on cow farts that have been ravaging the planet Earth. Along with Bessie, the beloved gas guzzlers that have been gracing the Michigan roadways since 1908 have also had a target pasted on their bumper. In an ironic twist of fate, the two have become a match made in Heaven. Sort of. It seems that Bessie’s milk can be processed and provide a greener transportation fuel. Another surprising twist, the milk will be transformed into vodka, and it’s all going to take place in the sleepy little Village of Constantine, Michigan. It’s official, and a press release from the Office of the Governor proves it. On Tuesday, May 23rd, Governor Gretchen Whitmer joined the Michigan Economic Development Corporation in announcing Michigan Strategic Fund (MSF) approval of a new dairy processing facility in the village of Constantine that will reduce the carbon footprint of dairy byproduct and bring new jobs and infrastructure to the community. It’s a joint venture between Michigan Milk Producers Association (MMPA) and Dairy Distillery USA. Dairy Distillery, a Canadian company, has developed technology to transform milk permeate, a byproduct of milk and other dairy processing, into ethanol. And the MSF is so convinced that they approved a $2 million Michigan Business Development Program performance-based grant and a 15-year State Essential Services Assessment exemption valued at $682,500 in support of the project. The word on the street is that the project is expected to create 12 well-paying jobs and generate a total capital investment of $41.1 million. Also, it seems that Michigan beat out our neighbor to the south, Indiana, to host the project. According to Dairy Distillery, Dairy Distillery developed technology to transform a lactose-rich dairy byproduct, called milk permeate into vodka, aptly named Vodkow. This high value use of milk permeate caught the attention of MMPA whose Constantine, MI facility produces 14,000 tons a year that’s being used for animal feed. Looking to create more value for its dairy farmer members, MMPA partnered with Dairy Distillery to build a plant to process its milk permeate into 2.2 million gallons of ethanol. So yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. Methane isn’t the only gas that Bessie will be producing.'}]"
