Ladapo called on the FDA to halt the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine because of possible cancer risks among others. Gov. Ron DeSantis said ""no"" to mask mandates ever returning to Florida. The number of Florida residents testing positive for COVID-19 has decreased in the past two weeks, but the coronavirus has killed more than 78,500 residents since the pandemic started in 2020, according to data released Friday. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released data Friday that showed 4,341 Florida hospital inpatients had COVID-19, down from 4,430 in a Thursday count. Three former employees have sued Walt Disney World, saying they were fired after refusing to wear face masks and get the COVID-19 vaccine due to religious reasons, according to a lawsuit. Florida has topped 71,000 new COVID-19 cases in each of the past five weeks, a report released Friday by the state Department of Health shows. It has exceeded 73,000 reported cases in each of the past four weeks — including totaling 74,481 cases during the week that started June 24 and ended Thursday. Publix says its pharmacies will not administer vaccines to children under the age of 5 at this time. The COVID-19 positivity rate in Florida continues to climb. It’s up to 17.2%. Two months ago it was only 4.9%. The rise has some wondering if they should get a second booster shot to better protect themselves. Florida doctors will be able to order COVID-19 vaccines for children under 5 from the federal government, the White House said Friday, after Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state would not order and distribute the shots in the state. Florida is the only state that hasn’t preordered COVID-19 vaccines for toddlers in anticipation of their final approval by the federal government, and Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday that he won’t facilitate their distribution, though he said they’ll be available to those who want them. As the federal Food and Drug Administration weighs approval of COVID-19 vaccinations for children under age 5, Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo is opposed to the potential change. The First District Court of Appeal said Monday it will hear arguments next month in a potential class-action lawsuit that contends the University of Florida should refund fees to students who were forced to learn remotely in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of Florida hospital inpatients with COVID-19 increased nearly 17 percent during the past week. Florida saw a jump in COVID-19 cases last week, while reported deaths of Florida residents during the pandemic climbed to more than 74,300. The number of Florida hospital inpatients with COVID-19 jumped 24 percent during the past week President Joe Biden appealed to world leaders for a renewed international commitment to attacking COVID-19 and ordered flags lowered to half-staff for the tragic milestone. Florida has exceeded 74,000 resident deaths from COVID-19, while newly reported cases steadily climb, according to data released Friday by the state Department of Health. The COVID-19 pandemic pushed many healthcare workers to the brink, causing many to leave the field. The COVID-19 pandemic pushed many healthcare workers to the brink, causing many to leave the field Florida\'s death toll in the coronavirus pandemic was nearing 74,000 deaths among residents based on data released by the state last week. The number of Florida hospital inpatients with COVID-19 has inched up after falling below 1,000, according to data posted online Thursday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is here and forecasters and meteorologists agree that it could be an extremely active season with the potential for more tropical storms and hurricanes due to weather patterns and warmer ocean waters.

Witnesses said it happened at around 11:15 a.m. local time. The building is a grain elevator and soybean-crusher facility owned by Heartland Crush, according to property records. The facility is operated by C6-Zero, a company that converts used roofing shingles into biodiesel and other products. Flames continued to be visible from the building for hours, with a large plume of smoke emanating from the building that was visible at long distances. Around 30 people were inside at the time of the incident, according to officials. As of mid-afternoon, 10 to 15 people were reported hurt, but there were no fatalities. Some of the injured had already been treated and released. Officials from the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics said that they were operating in their procedures for a “mass casualty event” and were standing by until the fire was extinguished. Several medical helicopters were dispatched to the scene, along with multiple fire departments. Officials have evacuated several nearby homes and are urging people to avoid being outside due to the smoke. Residents who were evacuated were told they could go to the Iowa County Transportation Building. There was no timeline on when people would be allowed back to their homes because of the air quality concerns and the potential for additional explosions at the plant. The fire was difficult to extinguish, according to officials, because of the materials in the plant. Firefighters were using foam to douse the flames. The City of Marengo said that water in the city may have a brown color to it on Thursday because of the excess water usage by firefighters. The facility has been in operation in Marengo since 2017.
