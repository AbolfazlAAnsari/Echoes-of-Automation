December 15, 2023 by Editor by Nathan Boddy A recent ribbon-cutting ceremony for Hamilton’s new fire station on Foxfield Street means that the time is right for a decision about the future of the historic fire station building. To that end, the City of Hamilton assembled a 12-person steering committee which has analyzed a preliminary architectural report and narrowed the options to three. The city now seeks greater input on the three options through open houses and an online survey. On Wednesday, December 20th there will be two open houses at the old fire station located at the corner of 3rd and State Streets in Hamilton. The first will run from 12 to 1:30 p.m., and the second from 5:30 until 7:30 p.m. Furthermore, residents are invited to read about the three viable options and submit their preference via an online survey, the link for which is provided below. Hard copies of the survey can also be found at the Bitterroot Public Library and City Hall. The old fire station was constructed in1906 to serve as a town hall, fire station and library, but in recent years had found itself woefully undersized for the purpose of public safety. With the fire station now located east of Highway 93, however, the historic building near the center of downtown can now be considered for its next chapter. Among the three options for the building are two which would see the return of city hall to the historic building after a 30+ year stay in the Bedford Building, which has been its home since 1989. Yet another could see the development of a mixed use facility on the site. Regardless of the option chosen, the building would undoubtedly require modernization updates such as access, HVAC, plumbing and electric. The Bitterroot Public Library is of pivotal interest during the decision process, as the library itself could be expanded to include portions of the historic site currently occupied by the fire bays on State Street, or removed entirely to inhabit the Bedford Building. Matthew Rohrbach, City Planner, says that the city has an interest in, “checking in with our community to figure out what we want to see there,” and that the preferred option will be sent before the City Council, which will make the ultimate decision. “We know that whatever option is chosen it could be a long road to completion,” he said, adding that they will develop a rigorous financial strategy to accomplish the chosen plan. That strategy will include seeking a variety of state and federal grants to offset costs.

Filed Under: News Hobo Hilton says December 26, 2023 at 12:54 PM Hold this thought: The old fire station was constructed in 1906… Look around town at all of the buildings that have been recently demolished. It is not cost effective to upgrade a building that is 117 years old. In layman’s terms “it’s a can of worms”. Demo it out, haul it to a land fill and make the site “shovel ready”. Build a new building up to current codes and finance it with Federal Grants. This is really not complicated. Hobo Ty paddock says December 17, 2023 at 9:13 AM Library is of no use these days. Move city hall and dmv and drivers license in and leave them there. Matt Watts says December 15, 2023 at 9:57 PM The link doesn’t work on phones to submit ideas for the old fire hall. Travis Sanderson says December 15, 2023 at 9:40 PM Use it as a safe haven for when people’s houses catch fire instead of sending them to a hotel. Send them to the the old fire station and build the insurance. So this way they have a place to stay. The old fire station has plenty of room and has a kitchen bathroom. Everything upstairs and has 2 bays that can maybe use to park their vehicles and build the insurance. This way, money comes in to pay for everything that we do for those people. Hobo Hilton says December 29, 2023 at 3:24 PM Your plan would require a management team, maintenance team and insurance in order to house people. Put a pencil to that cost. Motel stay is covered by home owner’s insurance. Many properties in Ravalli County have no insurance coverage due to run down conditions. Housing those people will turn into a can of worms since they will have no where to go. Alcoholics Anonymous is open to all who have a desire to stop drinking.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:53 pm The Teton Antique Steam and Gas Association’s 40th annual Threshing Bee and Bazaar will be held Sept. 15-17 on the TASGA grounds in Choteau. The grounds will be open from noon to 5 p.m. on Friday and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Admission is $10 a person or $25 a family and is good for all three days. Children 12 and under will be admitted free of charge. Owners are welcome to bring their dogs, but the dogs must be on a leash. The Threshing Bee grounds are located on the east side of town, two blocks south of the Choteau City Park. The grounds are accessed by a lane along the south side of the Weatherbeater Arena. Daily activities include a threshing demonstration at 1 p.m. and parade of tractors at 3 p.m. There will also be tractor-drawn train rides for children who are seated in converted storage drums from approximately 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. A horse and wagon team is tentatively scheduled to be on hand (fall seeding permitting) to offer wagon rides. On Saturday at noon, the club will serve cupcakes in honor of the organization’s 40th anniversary. There are only two founding members still alive, current member Rick Corey, and past member Bob Facklam. The club is dedicating this year’s bee to member Sandy Corey, Rick’s wife, who has been active with the threshing bee for the past 10 years. The club will have an electronic slide show featuring vintage photos and more on the history of the organization running on a continuous loop on a screen in the storage end of the depot building. The club will have campfire mugs with the organization’s new logo and 40th anniversary imprinted on them for sale as mementos of the occasion. TASGA will also have sweatshirts with the new logo and T-shirts and hats with the old logo on sale. Susie Durocher of Choteau will be operating a food concession, serving lunch on Friday starting at noon, and then breakfast and lunch on Saturday and Sunday. A kettle corn vendor is also planning to attend and have kettle corn and caramel corn for sale. The Montana Pullers Association on Saturday only will offer children’s pedal-tractor pulls in which a child gets to drive a pedal-operated tractor pulling a weighted sled. Jerry Coburn will oversee the blacksmith shop and give a demonstration each day. Andy Watson, owner of Big Sky Pottery in Fairfield and Bynum, will give pottery demonstrations on Friday and Saturday. Returning for a third year will be a display of old sewing machines and a few quilts. Janice Tucker is in charge of this display, which will be at the depot. Two women from Dutton will be at the bee doing yarn spinning demonstrations. Club members are hoping to have their letter press up and running using a block with the organization’s new logo on it. Barbara Larsen of Choteau is organizing other local musicians to provide music at the grounds during the bee, and the Choteau Community Band will play a one-hour concert from 11 a.m. to noon on Saturday on the front deck of the depot. Sunday will include a church service at 9 a.m. in the TASGA Country Church led by the Accordion Gospel Players from Great Falls. The accordion players plan to stay after the service and perform during the day. The club is expecting to have half a dozen or more vendors with items for sale the threshing bee. Sandy Corey said club members Lacetta and Craig Isenberg will have a booth with their alpaca products for sale. Club member Pasha Oldham, who does Native American beading, will also have a booth with beautiful handmade items. Conservation Grains, based in Choteau, will have its locally sourced and milled flours and baking mixes for sale and the Teton County Health Department will offer lead testing of soil samples and capillary blood testing of children for lead levels. “Exhibitors, crafters and vendors are welcome to come and participate for one day or all three,” Corey said. Those interested do not have to pre-register but Corey encourages her to contact her before the bee at 406-466-5409 so she can set space aside for vendors. There will be demonstrations at some of the shops throughout the event. Club members cut and bind the grain and haul the grain to be used in the threshing demonstrations. The group also made a trip to the mountains to gather logs to be cut in the sawmill. There will also be stationary engines and vintage tractors to see on the grounds. There are displays of tools and other treasurers throughout the buildings for those attending to find. Buildings on the grounds include the Old Time Print Shop, TASGA Country Church, a homestead house, schoolhouse, blacksmith shop, the Collins Post Office and the Choteau Train Depot. This summer, the organization has started work to add a General Store to the threshing bee grounds. Bob Frick and his sister Cecile Frick Smiley have donated a former garage, constructed in 1936, east of Dutton to TASGA. The building is on a trailer right now, but the club is working to get a foundation set for it, and will then begin converting it to a general store, that will be located near the current announcers stand in the middle of the TASGA grounds. Sandy Corey said the group will move the post office boxes into the general store, which will also have barber’s and dentist’s chairs set up in it, and is looking for donations of pre-1950s items to go in the store. Fairfield artist Diane Hausmann has drawn a sketch of what the building will look like once it is finished, and TASGA has set up donation cans to raise money for the renovation. The group will also be selling raffle tickets for a variety of prizes. The drawing will be held Sunday at 4 p.m. Ticket holders do not need to be present to win. The TASGA association was formed in 1983. There are about 30 members with an average of 20 attending the meetings. “We welcomed a few new members this year and would love to have others join us as well,” Sandy Corey said. The first few bees were held at Ove Larson’s property north of Choteau. The group elected to find a central location for the group. Choteau was selected and land was leased from both the town and county beside the Choteau Weatherbeater Arena. According to Rick Corey, when the group acquired the old train depot, things really began to take off. There has been a lot more added and hundreds of hours of volunteer labor to bring the grounds up to where they are today. TASGA welcomes people of all ages to join. The association meets at 2 p.m. on the last Sunday of each month and is always looking for new members. Dues are $15 a year. TASGA members volunteer their time at the grounds. Throughout the year, they do general maintenance and scheduled painting projects. The Threshing Bee event is the group’s biggest fundraiser of the year. The funds raised at this year’s bee are earmarked to pay for the scraping and painting of the original Choteau Depot building and for work on the new general store. In general, the club uses all funds raised to pay for yearly expenses and help the club preserve local history. The club members welcome everyone to attend the three-day event and enjoy looking around the grounds and taking part in the activities that are planned. “The weekend is always filled with fun for all ages,” Sandy Corey said.

your mobile phone will likely become your most important device. As such, it’s essential to know how to use the latest technology available, including eSIM. In this article, we’ll delve into the world of eSIM, explore how it works, and discuss its pros and cons, particularly in South Korea. We’ll also answer some frequently asked questions about mobile operators in South Korea to help you make an informed decision. eSIM stands for “embedded SIM,” a digital SIM card that comes integrated with a compatible device, eliminating the need for a physical SIM card. It is essentially a programmable chip that can connect to a mobile network, enabling voice, messaging, and data services. To use eSIM, your device must be compatible with the technology. If it is, you can activate your eSIM by scanning a QR code or downloading a mobile app from your mobile operator. Once activated, eSIM works the same way as a physical SIM card but offers greater flexibility and convenience since you can switch carriers without having to change the SIM card physically. Yes, South Korea supports eSIM, and many mobile operators offer eSIM services. However, not all devices are compatible with eSIM technology, so it’s essential to check if your device supports eSIM before buying a new plan. eSIM in South Korea eliminates the need for a physical SIM card, which means no more swapping out SIM cards when traveling or changing mobile carriers. This convenience makes eSIM particularly useful for international travelers. With eSIM, you have access to more mobile operator options, including prepaid plans that you can purchase directly from your device. This means you can choose the best plan that suits your needs without being tied to a specific carrier or location. Activating eSIM is straightforward, and you can do it from the comfort of your home using a QR code or mobile app. Since eSIM is built into the device, there’s no risk of losing or damaging your physical SIM card. Also, eSIM provides better security features than traditional SIM cards, such as two-factor authentication and remote deactivation. Not all devices support eSIM technology, which means you may need to purchase a new device if you want to use an eSIM plan. Although many mobile operators offer eSIM services, some still do not, which limits your options when choosing a carrier. eSIM plans are generally more expensive than traditional plans, which may not be ideal for users on a budget. As with any data plan, eSIM plans have their limitations. Therefore, it’s essential to ensure you purchase a plan that offers sufficient data coverage for your usage needs. The amount of data you require depends on various factors, such as your usage habits, streaming habits, and how long you’ll be staying in South Korea. However, here are some guidelines to help you estimate your data usage: It’s essential to note that these estimates may vary depending on your usage habits and device type. South Korea has three major mobile operators: SK Telecom, KT Corp, and LG Uplus. Each operator offers different plans and packages, so it’s essential to compare their services and prices before choosing the best one for you. Currently, SK Telecom is the most popular mobile operator in South Korea due to its extensive coverage and high-speed internet. However, KT Corp and LG Uplus also offer competitive packages and are worth considering. In conclusion, eSIM technology offers many benefits for mobile users in South Korea, including convenience, more options, and better security. However, it’s essential to consider the cons, such as device compatibility and cost, before switching to an eSIM plan. When choosing a mobile operator in South Korea, it’s crucial to compare their services and prices to determine which one best suits your usage needs. By doing so, you can enjoy fast, reliable, and affordable mobile services that meet your needs.

I don't have to go through several companies to run a dental office. I can login into my ADIT app and access all the data I need to continue to drive growth and performance with staff. I also like that we go to ONE single software for multiple uses. I love that I have a dedicated account manager and team that is super responsive and collaborative. The offerings are always expanding with new features and capabilities… and without any add on costs! I think Adit must have plans to take over the market space for all things dental. It’s such a great way to simplify what could be contracts and systems from a large number of vendors. Adit is EXTREMELY helpful with new patient acquisition. The ability to sort data and see, in real-time, what is happening at our practices is invaluable. Their reporting and support is really great too. The software allowed me to get rid of a lot of stand-alone products that I was having to log into and maintain (and pay for!) We love the confirmation texts, emails and new patient paperwork that's sent out to the patients. Also the website is user friendly. We love the patient forms that can be emailed to the patient and filled out without the need for them to be printed out. Also love the automatic appointment reminders and the option to book new appointments online. Very Useful software and simple to use by our team. Recommend it to every dental practice to increase efficiency. Integration with my patient management software makes the Website and Scheduling integration very effective. We use the platform for many aspects and really enjoy the communication between the office and patient. The reports and audio recordings help us coach and train to ensure we are providing the best patient experience. Overall we love that we went with Adit.

The woman sustained severe injuries to her chest and abdomen and was transported to Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center. Her condition at this time is unknown, according to the release. The woman was walking with one other person by the North Shore of Lake Yellowstone on Monday, July 17 when they saw two bison. The hikers turned to walk away from the bison, but one of the bison charged and gored the woman. “It is unknown how close the individuals were to the bison when it charged,” the release stated. The release went on to describe safety around bison, which are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans. During the months of July and August, bison can become aggravated more quickly due to mating season. The release advised: “Use extra caution and give them additional space during this time.” The public affairs office suggests a 25 yard distance from large animals like bison, elk, bighorn sheep, deer, moose and coyotes. For animals like bears and wolves, the office suggests a 100 yard distance of separation. This is the first bison goring incident recorded this year, with the last incident occurring on June 28, 2022.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:56 pm Is there truly anything better than when football season comes around? Fresh cut grass, community members supporting their local school colors, hard-hitting unbelievable plays, school spirit, the roaring of the crowd; there truly isn’t many other times that brings communities together than showing up on a Friday night to watch the Purple People Eaters of Cut Bank’s High School football team. With questions looming about how the football team will look this season after Coach Dylan Johnston’s resignation, the football team was needing a new identity, goals, and especially, leadership. As the CBHS football team took the field, it was already an underdog on multiple prediction websites having CBHS losing by 36. However, this did not phase the CBHS Purple People Eaters as they won decisively over the storied football team of Townsend. Offensively the team was consistently moving the ball, plays were executed, and most of all, many spectators could see that the football team was having a great time. Defensively, the PACK were all over the field making play after play, making timely turnovers, and working together like a Wolfpack to keep Townsend from scoring. “It is a great way to start a season,” Coach Coop (Cooper) said, “first game jitters with penalties hurt a little, but execution by the Purple People Eaters was excellent; it was nice to see a fun atmosphere on the sidelines, including the local community, and our boys really thrive on the support.” CBHS looks to knock off Jefferson County next week as they are coming into Cut Bank after losing to Florence 27-0 in Boulder.

delivered to your inbox! Tourists from all over the world flock to Logan Pass for expansive views at Glacier National Park. On the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, Brent Anderson was on California\'s warm southern coast. He may not have fully realized then that he would not get any real sleep for the next three days — and within 24 hours would be hanging off the side of a mountain in Glacier National Park in single-digit temps. It was a mountainside no human had been on before. Over Nov. 29–30, 49-year-old Anderson, a longtime Missoulian and Montana native who now lives near Hamilton, and Missoula\'s Dallin Carey, 32, made a nonstop 25-hour push up the north face of Bearhat Mountain. Their route, believed to be a first ascent, scaled 4,000 vertical feet of rock, solid seasonal ice and steep snow. The descent from the summit took another 11 hours, with a snowstorm blowing in. Dallin Carey, left, and Brent Anderson stand atop Bearhat Peak in Glacier National Park on Nov. 30, 2023. The pair claimed the first ascent of the mountain\'s 4,000-foot north face on their third attempt over the past six years. Bearhat Mountain sits at 8,689 feet elevation immediately east of Avalanche Lake, a popular day hike in the park. Many summer climbers reach the summit via a scramble along the mountain\'s south ridge after a short approach on the Hidden Lake boardwalk from Logan Pass. But the peak\'s north face, towering over the trail-devoid Hidden Creek valley and opposite the south face of Mount Cannon, is rarely seen. In winter, a trickle of water flowing from a snow basin near the summit freezes into a line of ice stretching about 3,000 vertical feet down to the valley. Ice that, for Anderson and Carey, was waiting to be climbed. The pair free-climbed the route: They used ropes and removable gear placed into rock and ice for protection in case of a fall, but they didn\'t use the gear or ropes to ascend the route. Rather, they used only their hands and feet, albeit with sharp crampons and ice tools, to climb. And they did it in a fast and light alpine style — a single upward push carrying all of their gear with them, with no outside support. In a Dec. 8 interview, the pair gave their route a traditional name, the Anderson-Carey Route, and rated the extensive ice portions as up to grade WI4 — (Winter Ice grade 4) a mixture of vertical and near-vertical ice for long, continuous stretches. In six years of research, poring over American Alpine Club journals and other accounts, Carey found no evidence of anyone taking on Bearhat\'s north face. That wasn\'t entirely a surprise. Glacier isn\'t as popular a mountaineering destination as the volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest or the massive granite spires and peaks of Alaska and the Canadian Rockies — not to mention the Alps, Himalaya or Andes. And Glacier\'s peaks are notoriously crumbly, rife with loose blocks and insecure placements for climbing gear. ""It’s probably not a route that’s going to get done, ever again,"" Carey said. But that\'s not to say it wasn\'t a significant feat. Some of the most daring and difficult ascents around the world are seldom, if ever, repeated. Dallin Carey leads a pitch of vertical ice on the north face of Bearhat Peak on Nov. 29. Carey and Brent Anderson climbed 25 hours nonstop to record the first ascent of the face. Chris Gibisch, a 44-year-old professional mountain climber from Missoula, has notched first ascents in China, India and North America, including setting a new high point on Alaska\'s famed Moose\'s Tooth before the mountain was eventually climbed. In a phone interview last week, a month before he was set to fly to Patagonia, Gibisch said that Glacier is often overlooked despite holding top-tier mountaineering challenges. ""I think people can kind of downplay Glacier National Park because it’s in the Lower 48, it’s not Alaska,"" he said. ""But I’ve given the warning, it’s f---ing real out there."" He said Glacier\'s challenge lies not only in route difficulty and length, but in differing conditions between 4,000 and 8,000 feet elevation, short days, avalanche risk, inconsistent ice, temperamental weather and challenging approaches through dense brush and timber. He said the unpredictability of Glacier\'s relatively low elevation — Will there be any ice? Will there be too much snow? — in some ways makes it more challenging than high-altitude Himalayan peaks where climbers can more often count on frozen-solid conditions. ""It takes a lot of tenacity, which is what they’ve done,"" he said. ""I really appreciate knowing how much effort these guys put in, spotting that route."" An annotated image from Google Earth shows the approximate route of Brent Anderson and Dallin Carey\'s first ascent of the north face of Bearhat Mountain in Glacier National Park. Michael Moore, a veteran climber and former longtime Missoulian reporter and editor, made first ascents in the Northern Cascades in the 1980s, including the north faces of Mount Shuksan, Mount Kent and Mount Snoqualmie. He summited Denali, in Alaska and the highest peak in North America, via the Cassin Ridge in \'83. ""I think almost anything, big mountains in Glacier, north faces, it’s going to be an ordeal,"" Moore, 67, said in a Dec. 13 interview. Of Anderson and Carey, he said, ""They’ve been at it for a long time, together, and they always seem to have — there’s something waiting. There’s something in Glacier that they want to get."" Gibisch called Anderson and Carey\'s first ascent of Bearhat\'s north face ""spectacular."" ""I was super pumped to see them do it,"" he said. ""Just from my experience I knew it was a lot of work."" Anderson\'s flight from San Diego landed in Missoula around 11:45 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 28. Carey was headed to see family in his native Colorado a few days later. In between, they had a few days to climb. Anderson, an estate manager, and Carey, a civil engineer, have been climbing together since 2016. They originally planned to visit Canada in late November to climb some “mega routes,” Carey said. But Carey and his family hiked to Avalanche Lake a few days prior and saw the ice routes on the backside of the lake were frozen up, meaning Bearhat likely was, too. So the plan changed: The pair would take on Bearhat once again. It wasn\'t their first time. Their first attempt at the route was in November 2018, the Monday before Thanksgiving. With overloaded packs and no trail to the base of the climb, it took the pair most of a day just to reach the bottom of the route. After another day, that one spent climbing, they were only one-third of the way up. Wanting to be with family for Thanksgiving, they bailed. The next year, 2019, they reached the base a bit quicker and hit their previous high-point after 4.5 hours of climbing. But about two-thirds of the way to the summit, climbing through the night, they got off route. The error revealed that they\'d overcorrected from the year before: After they rappelled down to where they made their mistake, they didn\'t have enough food or fuel left to complete the climb. They\'d gone too light. ""We came off that mountain and bought brighter headlamps,"" Anderson said, to which Carey gave a laughing reply: ""We can\'t get lost again."" ""It was like 1 a.m. when we got boxed out,"" Anderson said, ""which was a shame because we were so close."" They didn\'t get on the route in 2020 or \'21 — one year was too snowy, which increased avalanche risk at the top, and one year was too warm for ice to form. And last year the road to Avalanche trailhead was closed for construction in the late fall. This year, Carey said, ""everything finally came together."" From the airport, Anderson drove to his house at the mouth of Blodgett Canyon, packed his gear, drove back to Missoula and picked up Carey at 3:45 a.m. Nov. 29. Carey drove so Anderson could get a small nap in during the drive, and both took a short nap in the trailhead parking lot. They set out on foot at 8 a.m. After two prior times on the wall and more than a dozen hikes to the base, the approach this year took just 2.5 hours, instead of a day.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:57 pm When the fog parted above the Washington-Grizzly Stadium this afternoon, a crowd was able to see Mount Sentinel’s “M” with colors draped over the letter to form a massive Palestinian flag. Although the exact people who did it are unconfirmed, an Instagram page called “MT4Palestine” took credit for the act. It claims 15 people helped unroll 9000 square feet of butcher paper from the top of the M around noon today, aiming to reveal it at the kickoff of the Brawl of the Wild. The plan took around two weeks to come to fruition, the page said in a direct message to the Kaimin. “We took this action to send a message to our politicians, especially Jon Tester and Steve Daines, that we hold them accountable for the Israeli genocide of the Palestinian people,” the page said in a message to the Kaimin. Both Daines and Tester have spoken against a ceasefire in the Israel-Palestine conflict. Notably, Daines is collaborating with United States Rep. Ryan Zinke on bills seeking to block Palestinians from asylum and immigration in the United States. “Here in Montana, we don’t have a Golden Gate Bridge to shut down,” said Drew Mozzer, a Missoula community member and co-owner of River City Brews who helped plan the display, “but we do have an M and ‘Cat-Griz’ game that is awfully important to 27,000 people.” However, the thick fog that hung over Missoula until around 3:45 p.m. prevented anyone from seeing the Palestinian flag display until around the end of the game. Around an hour afterward, University of Montana staff members tore the paper down, UM spokesperson Dave Kuntz said. This was not the first time Missoulians have used materials like paper and plastic to turn the M into a message. In October 2018, the M was turned into “IMPEACH” and “F U TRUMP” when former president Donald Trump visited Missoula, and the extra letters were promptly taken down by UM staff. Displaying banners without permission on the M is a violation of the facilities use policy, Kuntz explained. “While the University is a public forum, there are things called time, place and manner laws,” Kuntz said. “The display specifically can’t interrupt academic proceedings, University activities or operation, and it can’t interfere with the rights of others.” However, according to the facilities use policy provided on UM’s website, “unplanned expressive activity” can happen in outdoor spaces like the M so long as they don’t violate time, place and manner restrictions. The rub, Kuntz said, primarily lies in how the M is a University space and the display was politically charged in nature. Historically, the M and the Brawl of the Wild has been the site of many protests and public calls. In 2013, Kuntz remembered crop dusters flying political flags around the Bobcat Stadium in Bozeman. The University of Montana Police Department is looking into the event, Kuntz said, but the worst that could happen to anyone found is punishment through the student conduct code or similar processes.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 7:00 pm PABLO — Busse introduced himself and met with Tribal Council to discuss issues important to tribal members as he campaigns. Growing up on a farm in a small town in rural Kansas and living in Kalispell for the past 30 years have given him an appreciation for Montana’s way of life. “Montana has made me a better person,” Busse said. “I feel the state is being made into a playground for billionaires and taken away from everyday Montanans.” Busse enjoys hunting and the outdoors with his family. Some of his favorite memories with family in the outdoors are at places on the reservation. He also enjoys spending time on the Blackfeet Reservation where he’s made several friends. “I’m worried that all of our Montana kids aren’t going to be able to live and experience this place like we did,” Busse said. For many years, he worked in the firearms industry and helped build one of the world’s top gun companies. Conservative politics, racism, and rampant fear-mongering motivated Busse to end his 30-year career in the firearms industry. Called a whistleblower, Busse turned his back on the gun industry and their questionable tactics. Believing that decency and responsibility were no longer valued by the gun industry frustrated Busse. He wrote a book called “Gunfight-My Battle against the Industry that Radicalized America.” Busse appeared on the Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Al Franken’s Podcast, NowThis News, CNN, Vice News, Chris Hayes Podcast, and ABC News to talk about his battle against the gun industry’s tactics to increase profits. On Sept. 14, Busse announced he was running for Governor. Although Busse has never held political office, he is known as an environmental advocate who served in leadership roles for conservation organizations. “I’m worried that the Republican supermajority and this governor are imperiling many of the things that I think are sacred and special about Montana. I think one of those is our relationship with our Native populations. I think that some of the racist, ugly rhetoric that has come out of the Republican Party in the last two or three years is terrible. It’s embarrassing. It takes us back to a time when there wasn’t respect, and I’m deeply, deeply troubled about it,” Busse said when asked why he wanted to run for governor. Seeing outright racism during the last legislative session appalled Busse. Seeing first hand how elected officials felt that it was okay to think the way they did and speak openly didn’t sit right with Busse. So far on his campaign tour, he’s traveled hundreds of miles and visited the Flathead and Blackfeet Reservations. With plans to visit every reservation and rural towns, in addition to the larger cities in Montana, Busse hopes to engage with the real Montanans. He told Tribal Council that representing all of Montana, including rural and tribal communities, is a priority. “I’m going to spend a lot of time in the rural areas of the state because they’re important,” Busse said. Tribal leaders expressed support for Medicaid expansion and ensuring tribal consultation on policy decisions that impact Native communities. Tribal leaders requested that Busse maintain liaison positions to continue communication between the state and tribes on policy issues. Busse said he is committed to maintaining or strengthening those positions. Education was also a key topic. Tribal members emphasized the importance of the Indian Education for All program and ensuring curriculum taught the history and culture of Montana tribes from an indigenous perspective. “Education should be provided through your lens, not through somebody else’s lens,” Busse agreed. Economic development on reservation was another priority discussed. CSKT operates businesses to be self-sufficient and fund tribal government services without taxation. Busse pledged cooperation on economic development as governor. Busse criticized the Republican supermajority in the state legislature and current Gov. Greg Gianforte for policies he says are making the state unaffordable for working people. He cited rising housing costs, underfunding of public schools and a lack of respect for scientific wildlife management. “My point here is that the governor and the state are instituting policies that are making this stuff worse, not making it better.” If elected, Busse said his top priorities would be improving public education by fully funding public schools and teachers, implementing a fairer tax system and housing policies for working Montanans to be able to afford to live here, implementing scientific management of wildlife and agencies, and rural health care accessible to everyone. “If anything, we should make life easier on Montana residents,” Busse said. Busse will continue campaigning across Montana in the lead-up to the 2024 election. At this point, he’s running unopposed in the primary and is set to run against current Republican Gov. Gianforte.

T… The Valier Panther football team clinched a spot in the playoffs and a first round home playoff game with a win over fifth-ranked Power-Dutton-Brady (PDB) on Senior Night Friday in Valier. Homecoming is always a hard week to battle through games because teams are usually dealing with a lot of extra festivities and worn down players. Add the seasonal flu that is going around, and Valier had to really battle against Cascade to win in 5 (27-25, 21-25, 25-20, 15-25, 15-6). The Valier Panthers took on the Sunburst Refiners on Friday night in Valier for the Panthers’ homecoming game and won 38-0. The Valier Panthers improved to 3-1 overall and 2-0 in conference with a 61-7 win over the Great Falls Central Catholic Mustangs under the lights at Memorial Stadium on Saturday night in Great Falls. Cross country teams from nine regional high schools and several middle schools got an early look at where they stand in the young season during the annual Mike Reynolds Time Trials on Friday at the Cut Bank Golf and Country Club. The Shelby Coyotes football team opened its conference schedule with a big win against Harlem 44-22. Following a bye in the season’s first week, the Cut Bank Wolves opened their 2022 football campaign at home Friday night against the Eureka Lions under clear skies and with temperatures in the low 90s. The Shelby Coyote Volleyball team spent their weekend in the east, losing to Malta 19-25, 23-25, 25-18, and 18-25. Shelby then competed in the Chinook tournament, and left pool play in first, defeated Valier, before losing to Chinook. The Lady Indians volleyball team hosted the Lady Wolves on Friday, Sept. 2, at the Tipi Dome. They beat their opponents in the first set, 25-20, but came up short in an extended second set, 24-26. They regained their feet in the third round, 25-20, but were unable to close the deal in the fo… Rodeo fans had every opportunity last week to catch some of the youngest future stars in action over several days as Jimi Champ’s BHS Ag class sponsored its junior high/high school rodeo. Coach Kadie Briggs is in her third year as head coach of the Lady Panthers Volleyball Team. With an additional three years on the coaching staff and eight returning seniors, experience promises to be a favorable factor in the Panthers’ season. “Last week was a whirlwind with five tournaments in eight days,” Browning golf coach Brian Harrell said of the 2022 team. Their efforts encompassed Columbia Falls, Havre, Shelby, Whitefish and Ronan. Cut Bank cross country coach Jared Berkram encourages his team as he runs near Mylee Barry on Aug. 18 at the Rumney Ranch. Runners endured a hot and hilly 5k.
