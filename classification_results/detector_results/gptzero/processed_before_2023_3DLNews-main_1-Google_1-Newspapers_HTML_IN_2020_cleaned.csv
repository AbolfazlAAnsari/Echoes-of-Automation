Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 3:56 pm Editor, The Daily Clarion Nick Michas fires up The Ole Hokey Pokey machine, a nostalgic favorite concession at the Gibson County Fair that he restored in 2016. PRINCETON Mr. Fireworks. Mr. Heritage Days. Mr. Christmas Lights. Mr. Princeton. If a project boosted the City of Princeton, Nick Michas was all about it. He was the genial host of Princeton’s “Heritage Days Feud.” He raised money for the Salvation Army canned food drive. He raised money and climbed into a bucket truck for many Christmas seasons to decorate the down. He solicited donations and organized the city’s annual Independence Day Fireworks for decades. Michas, 84, one of Princeton’s most devoted volunteers, passed away peacefully in his sleep Friday. He worked in law enforcement for more than 30 years, sworn in as one of the first merit deputies in the Gibson County Sheriff’s Office in 1972, retiring in 1990 but going to work the next day as a Princeton Police Department dispatcher. In his tenure as chief of the PPD, he and Deputy Jim Stoll took convicted murderer Richard Branum into custody during a countywide pursuit of the killer of Oakland City police officer Michael Deno. When he retired from the Princeton PPD in 2001, he planned to devote more time to other pursuits. And he did. Dave Rhinefort, a retired Princeton Police officer who worked with Michas, learned the news in church Sunday. “A lot will be said about Nick; but if ever there was a ‘Mr. Princeton,’ it would be Nick Michas. He will be sorely missed!” “What a loss to the community,” reflected former Daily Clarion publisher Gary Blackburn, when he learned the news Saturday. “Nick and Peg were a team, always doing good works. We lost a part of the best team in Princeton.” Princeton Mayor Greg Wright described Michas as “one of the most community-minded individuals I have ever met.” Wright, who also serves as Gibson County Historian, said Michas was a big influence on his own interest in local history. “Way back in 1984, he assisted in the courthouse centennial celebration pamphlet and gave tours during the Golden Heritage Days festival. Princeton is a much better place because of him and his family, and the fact that they were part of our town and among our citizens.” George Rehnquist volunteered with Nick and Peg Michas for many years. “Probably one of my first times working with them was when we reinvented Heritage Days a long time ago. He always had the best interests of this community foremost in everything he did,” said Rehnquist. “There was a lot of time sacrificed on his part, and he was never expecting or wanting a lot of thanks for it. He was always out there, doing for other people. We in the community certainly benefited a great deal from his services. He and Peg made a great team.” Rehnquist last saw Michas a week or so ago, when he was leaving the CVS store and spotted Michas driving a Willys Jeepster. Four years ago, Michas set his sights on restoring the Jeep, and his wife said he just recently put in a new radiator. “Last Sunday, a week ago, he took it out for the first time,” Peg Michas said. “He was thrilled.” Michas was again tinkering in the garage with the top of the vehicle last Thursday. “He came out of the garage and asked me, ‘You wanna go for a ride?’ ” she remembered. “I had just had my hair done and said, ‘I don’t think so,’ and he grinned and told me, ‘You worry too much.’ I said, ‘That’s my job,’ ” his wife remembered. Peg thought no more about it, but this weekend, she had some regrets that he didn’t get that last drive in the Jeep. And then she learned that neighbors spotted Nick on a solo drive without her, the day before he passed away. “He got his ride in. He left and got back without me knowing. He didn’t want to worry me.” People person“Nick was a people person,” said Peg, who celebrated 60 years of marriage to Nick earlier this year. “He lived to serve. He served his church. He served the community. He just liked people. But the greatest loves in his life are his kids and his grandkids. They all called him ‘Grandpa Fix-it.’ He fixed everything for them.” Her husband’s volunteerism was boots-on-the-ground style. “He never started anything for somebody else to do,” she said. “He started it for him to do it.” She said it wasn’t her husband’s style to start something and delegate. “He would say, ‘This is something I’m going to do, do you want to join me?’ ” Those projects included the Christmas lights project, which involved soliciting donations, then climbing into a bucket truck to install them on light poles through town for nearly 20 years. He served 40 years as president of Princeton Area Betterment, founding the Golden Heritage Days festival in 1980, and launching the Independence Day fireworks three years later. Michas also served on the advisory board of The Salvation Army of Gibson-Pike Counties. He chaired the annual You Can Help food drive every Christmas since 1994 — even campaigning for one of the drives from his hospital bed. “He really loved the You Can Help Drive,” said Peg. “He had not really been able to do it, but he did it anyway.” She said her husband spent a lot of time trying to decide on whether to cancel this year’s July 4 fireworks campaign. “It just about killed him to have to cancel,” she said. “But he did it for the sake of others. They (businesses) didn’t have the money and he didn’t think he should ask for it.” Michas was a lifetime member of the Gibson County Fair Board, where he spent years volunteering. “He just loved people. He really did. It didn’t matter where he was.” Family-wise, he’s remembered by his kinsmen as “the greatest jokester and the best storyteller of all time,” Peg said. “When he told a funny joke and it went over really well, we heard it a lot,” she laughed. Peg said a cousin of Nicks told her: “I want to live like Nick lived. He lived happy.” She agrees. He was surrounded by family and left this world in his sleep, a happy man. Funeral service is Wednesday at 10 a.m. at Bethel Memorial Church in Princeton. Visitation is from 2-8 p.m. Tuesday at the church, to allow plenty of time for friends and family to attend. All precautions for COVID-19 are being observed, and Peg said she, her children and grandchildren want everyone to come and feel welcome and safe at the visitation and services.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:00 pm Anytime Fitness celebrated the grand opening of its new location in Frankfort with a ribbon cutting ceremony Tuesday at 2410 E. Wabash Street. Members of the Clinton County Chambers of Commerce and City of Frankfort Community Development Director Annie Bacon were on hand to celebrate another new business in Frankfort. “The grand-opening events and even just opening in general is a fabulous feeling,” said Nicole Cianci, regional director for Anytime Fitness. “It is one thing to sign everyone up and get everyone excited to be in here, but the faces and the reactions of getting to see what they get to finally work out on and get into – it is the best feeling in the world. To be able to change people’s lives and see the reactions of their new journey – grand openings are about that.” The new Frankfort club opened in late May under the guidance of Facility Manager Kaylie Davids and Assistant Manager Charles Ballard. “They are both raised here and live here, so they know the community very well,” Cianci said. “Honestly, (Frankfort) needed it. When we looked around, this town had the YMCA. I think, from my understanding, another gym had closed down – a ‘mom and pop,’ which is sad. The biggest thing is to make sure that any town has the resources. This was a good town. The demographics were good and to see that it was a very limited list of where you could go to get healthy. That was something we wanted to make an impact on.” Cianci says that things have been great at the Frankfort location since it began signing up members several months ago. “We have a couple hundred members,” she said. “The nice thing about Anytime Fitness is it is 24 hours, and it is worldwide. So, we have a lot of members who have joined and they travel, which is great. They can use it anywhere they go. For people who work the crazy-schedule business hours where they can’t make it in until 1 a.m. or 2 a..m, they are still able to come here. Just being able to give everyone the convenience factor was huge. So, opening up, we have done really well. “Now, obviously, we anticipated opening much sooner than May,” Cianci added. “Luckily, we have been able to open, and it went great.” The coronavirus pandemic and Governor Eric Holcomb’s resulting stay-at-home order put Frankfort’s Anytime Fitness in a holding pattern for a few months. “We started (work on the club) in the winter,” Cianci said. “With permits and contractors, there is so much that goes into it. But everyone worked really hard. It got pushed back a little and, as soon as we were getting ready to open, coronavirus hit.” Cianci said that, once the governor lifted the restriction on gyms, people were ready to work out. “People were coming in with open arms,” she said. “People want to work out. People want to stay healthy, and people were ready to do that when we opened.” Cianci said that providing a safe workout space during this pandemic became the top priority for Anytime Fitness. “When all of this happened, we sat down as a team at our corporate office,” she said. “We had to make sure that these clubs were safe. So, the biggest priority was that we closed down, and absolutely everything got disinfected. We wiped everything down from head to toe. First, we started with cleaning and then we took extra precautions. We stopped things like towel service, unfortunately. We did things like Fresh Fruit Monday and Thirsty Thursday, which will come back. We unfortunately did have to take a few of those things away, but we put in the safety precautions. We added more hand sanitizers around all the walls. There are fit wipes everywhere, sanitation wipes, we added a whole table with microfiber rags and sanitation spray so that members feel more comfortable being able to grab their own sanitation, their own rag and really being to wipe things down before and after. We did obviously implemented the 6-feet social distancing. We have decals on our floor, and we did space out the cardio to every other being able to be used for right now. After this slows down a little bit, all of the cardio will be accessible. “It was a smooth transition,” Cianci continued. “Everyone is abiding by it. Everyone is wiping down their equipment. We are constantly cleaning. Bathrooms are checked every half hour. It is the top priority. The last thing we want to do is close a club and have people not be able to exercise because I know during this entire thing a lot of people that never even struggled maybe emotionally, mentally, physically, struggled, and it was very hard. So, for us to be able to open and make people feel safe is a top priority.” Cianci says that Anytime Fitness’ convenience and staff are what set them apart. “The no-excuse factor really goes into play because it is 24 hours, 7 days a week, 365 days a year,” sje said. “There are no excuses. You have to have time for yourself. We have made it available to you. It is a key fob swipe. Our security is high-end. You have a key to access the facility. You have private facility restrooms, which is great. You don’t have to go in a locker room and change and shower in front of anyone else. You go in, change privately, come out and do your thing. “It is the convenience factor that sets us aside from everyone else,” she continued. “You can go to any gym and find a treadmill. You can go anywhere and find a bike. But, not only do we have the top-of-the-line equipment, what sets us aside is our staff. It is me, it is Kaylie, it is Charles. It is the people who are working in our clubs with our customers and our clients to make sure that when they walk through that door, they are comfortable. That when they come here for their first workout and they are nervous, we are here to help them. That is what we have that other people do not have. We get to know our members like family. When people walk into this gym, we want them to feel like this is their separate home.” Cianci also mentioned that Anytime Fitness has a “Silver Sneakers” program. “It is for people who are 65 and up, through their insurance, and it covers their gym membership,” she said. Thought Anytime Fitness had its ribbon cutting ceremony Tuesday, the celebration of its grand opening will continue with a Health Fair from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. each day through Thursday. “Kaylie partnered up with the Humane Society, and we have been collecting cleaning supplies and different supplies (cat and god food, pet toys, bleach, HE laundry detergent, etc.) to give to the Humane Society, We are doing a dollar raffle right now, and all the proceeds are going to the Humane Society. They are also going to be coming here so that people can possibly adopt a little pet if they want.” Local businesses have donated a variety of raffle prizes. “We wanted to promote health and promote fitness, but also make it engaging,” Cianci said. “We are having fun little activities to get raffle tickets. These grand-opening events are fun. It is really just about getting to know the members and partnering up with the community. “I want to thank Frankfort for welcoming us with open arms,” she added. “Everyone has been so great. Everyone who comes in comes in with a smile. This has been a great town to open a club in. I am really excited to continue to watch where this goes and hopefully help as many people in the community as possible.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles. Success!

For many drinkers, however, it can be difficult to identify exactly when their drinking habits turned into an unpleasant situation.

Alcohol.org conducted a survey of 4,957 drinkers to find out how many can identify with some of these warning signs and symptoms of alcoholism in themselves. It was discovered that overall, 1 in 10 drinkers in Indiana (10%) said they could identify with at least one sign of alcoholism. Nationally, this figure was thirteen percent: 15% of men felt this way as compared to 11% of women. This figure was highest in Delaware (38%) and lowest in North Carolina, where just 6% of drinkers said they could identify with at least one sign of alcoholism. Of those Indiana drinkers who said they identify with at least one sign of alcoholism (national figures in brackets): Intoxication can leave you in an altered mental state, especially if you were feeling down or troubled prior to drinking. Some people lose control over their actions when intoxicated, which can lead to regrets and consequences. Despite things like recommended guidelines and alcohol serving amounts, it’s important to note that alcoholism has varying ranges and greatly differs depending on the individual and a host of other circumstances, like their physiological and mental state. Two drinks might be pushing it over the edge for someone who may notice symptoms of alcoholism in their drinking habits but another person might be able to have four drinks without any indication of a further pressing issue. In addition to the above signs and symptoms that could indicate a potential problem with alcohol, Alcohol.org explains several others which could hint towards alcoholism:'}]"

'“Snoddy’s” Coal Creek Cemetery located 7.1 miles south of Covington, Indiana sits in the middle of peaceful wooded scenery. Coal Creek flows past the cemetery on the west side. The cemetery is a perfect destination for a nice Sunday drive. It is the final resting place of several families with local history connections. It is actually two separate cemeteries. The “old” part located to the north side of Snoddy’s Road is Snoddy’s Cemetery located in Wabash Township and sits on the southwest corner of land owned currently by John Nail. This is a closed cemetery; meaning burials no longer take place here. The old cemetery is maintained by the board that oversees the Coal Creek Cemetery located south across Snoddy’s Road. Coal Creek Cemetery is an active cemetery and is located in Fulton Township, at 2351 West Snoddy Road. “Snoddy’s” is attached to this cemetery to distinguish another Fountain County Coal Creek Cemetery located in Richland Township. The “old” Snoddy’s Cemetery is the final resting place of Samuel I. Snoddy and some of his family members. Descendants of John Hardesty are also here. Snoddy and Hardesty had purchased Headley saw and grist Mill together in 1851. Hardesty later sold his half to George Mosier who later sold to Samuel I. Snoddy. Mr. Snoddy tore the mill down and rebuilt a flourmill and developed the land around the mill creating Snoddytown. He sold the Mill to a couple of his sons who built a new dam in 1906. The mill was torn down in 1980 by then owner Betty Snoddy Hembrey. The dam is still there. Other old names that can be found on the old side are: Abernathy, Allen, Elwell, Keller, McLain, Penner, Ricketts, Robbins, Scratcher, Snyder Shoemaker, Thomas, Richardson, Yocum and others. It is speculated that Coal Creek cemetery (the new side) in Fulton Township burials began about 1900. That date is the earliest death dates that can be found. Local history books state that Wilson Richardson donated land for a church to be built in 1896 at the Northwest corner of the land where the cemetery is currently located. It was dedicated as the United Brethren by Rev. R.J. Newgent and known as Coal Creek Chapel. It was abandoned and eventually torn down about 1970. The cemetery property deed states Wilson F. Richardson sold 3.5 acres of land immediately surrounding the church to the Coal Creek Cemetery Association in 1922 for $375. Wilson F. Richardson died five years later and was buried in the cemetery. Wilson was a descendant of Daniel Richardson Sr., the first landowner (1822) Wabash Township that later became Fulton Township. Many family names can be found on the new side of folks who were a part of the Coal Mine boom of the 1870’s at Stringtown. Most were coal miners but some were mine owners or those who leased the mines. A few of the names are; Rowell, Berto, Martin, McLain, Mycroft, Snoddy, Spoonamore, Winters, Thomas and others. Several generations of the Snoddy family held various positions on the Cemetery board over the years. Betty Snoddy Hembrey, the last “Snoddy” board member resigned at the end of 2011. Betty passed in 2014 and of course buried here. Getting board members is not an easy task. By 2013 there were only three members, President Kim McKinney, Treasurer Buffy White and Secretary Kim Martin. Fortunately, the Rick and Betty Rahm family of Stringtown have been donating their time and money to help. They have picked up trash and sticks, met with monument setters, mowed, donated a new cemetery sign, flagpole, United States flag and military flag and see that the flags are hung and taken care of. There is more than one generation of Rahms buried at Coal Creek Cemetery. In September of 2018, President Kim McKinney died unexpectedly. Kim, who also lived at Stringtown, took great care of the cemetery. I remember one winter Kim had to mark a grave in knee high snow when no one else could get down there. She and her grandsons would clean up the cemetery also. They put out and picked up Memorial flags. Kim is buried here as well as several family members. It has been hard to find a replacement for Kim, but I am happy to announce that Ron Crowder has recently accepted the position of President. Ron has been a board member in the past and many Crowder names can be found in the cemetery. Buffy White continues as the Treasurer. Buffy has been on the board for over 10 years. Kim Martin has been a member almost 9 years. Buffy and Kim have 5 generations of family buried in the two cemeteries. If you are interested in any information regarding the cemetery please contact Buffy 765-585-0821 or Kim 765-793-4123 or Ron 765-793-2880. Like all cemeteries financial support for the upkeep of the cemetery is crucial. The board members receive no money. We are volunteers and actually spend our own money on office supplies and postage needs. When you purchase a burial spot you receive a deed and that becomes your land. You do need to follow certain guidelines set by the cemetery board such as not planting trees and notifying a board member if selling your lot or having a monument set up. Purchasing a burial lot does not include the cost of mowing and maintaining said lot. Memorial Day used to be a traditional time of year when family members would make a donation to cemeteries to offset the cost of mowing for the upcoming summer. It seems to be a forgotten tradition anymore. Please consider donating to any cemetery you have family in. Shaun Smith’s mowing crew has been mowing since 2017. Shaun has family buried at Coal Creek Cemetery. Coal Creek would like to have the cemetery mowed every week but we cannot do that without funds. We have to look at what we have every spring and divide that by what each mowing costs and that’s how many times we can have it mowed. The cost to mow every week from May through September would be about $6,000 at the present rate. Cost of gas can make the price fluctuate. The last few years we have only had a budget of about $3,800 to $4,200. Any amount donated is helpful. Another helpful way is when a family member passes away; in lieu of flowers you can have donations go the Coal Creek Cemetery or a cemetery of your choice. To make a donation to Coal Creek Cemetery send a check to Coal Creek Cemetery in care of Buffy White, 1001 2nd St. Covington, IN 47932. Regardless of where your loved ones are buried, please help defray mowing and upkeep cost with a donation. Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup. Error!

An eastbound South Shore Line train departs from the Hammond station. Regular train services resumed after construction was concluded. CHESTERTON — More than 450 online attendees got an update on the $420.3 million Double Track project to speed passenger rail service between Gary and Michigan City. The project aims to reduce travel time between Chicago and Michigan City from 1 hour 41 minutes to 67 minutes, putting Michigan City solidly within commuting distance. The Double Track and West Lake Corridor projects are projected to attract more than $2 billion in private investment near the rail lines over the next 20 years, said Mike Noland, president and general manager of the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District, which operates the South Shore Line. Construction of the Double Track project is expected to begin next year. The impact in Michigan City is arguably the biggest along the entire stretch of the Double Track project. Noland presented the changes during an online open house Wednesday night. Michigan City’s historic station, with its iconic terra cotta façade, will be removed. However, the façade will be incorporated into the new station. “We’re doing a façade-ectomy,” Noland said, to rebuild it brick by brick. A three-story garage is incorporated into the design, with the roof serving as the third level. Surface parking is much cheaper to build, but if demand for development of the surface parking area warrants, two additional levels could be added to the parking garage, Noland said. A lot 40 feet wide west of the new station, along Franklin Street, is being designated for a future transit-oriented development. That new building would connect to the station and parking garage. Michigan City is planning to apply for quiet zone status, which would forbid South Shore Line trains from blowing their horns in the city. Helping qualify for this status includes closing a number of grade crossings. Along 10th Street in Michigan City, crossings will be eliminated at three streets — Carlton, Donnelly and Claire. Along 11th Street, there will be 10 crossings eliminated — Kentucky, Tennessee, Elson, Manhattan, Buffalo, Pine, Spring, Cedar, York and Maple. In addition, the station will mean making 11th Street one-way, for eastbound traffic only. Gary’s Miller area also will see substantial changes. U.S. 12 will be rerouted onto Melton Road to allow for a new station and a second set of tracks. At the Ogden Dunes/Portage station, parking is being added south of U.S. 12, with a pedestrian crossing to be added on U.S. 12 at Hillcrest Road to accommodate access to the station. Along the entire length of the project, four new bridges will be built. Once the project is completed, additional trains will be added, including six trains for rush hour, Noland said. NICTD plans to increase the number of daily trains from 39 to 55, he said. “We’re going to get more toward hourly service off-peak,” Noland said. In addition to the second set of tracks to Michigan City, train speeds will be increased by skipping some stations along the way, he said. The Double Track project will require about 1,000 construction jobs, Noland said. Transit-oriented development within a mile of the tracks for the entire rail network will add an estimated 6,000 to 7,000 construction jobs over 20 years, he said. Expensive high-level platforms will be built at the new stations, but not at Beverly Shores, which will keep its historic station. There aren’t enough riders boarding the train there to justify the cost, Noland said. Those platforms allow riders to step directly onto the train, rather than climb the steps onto the rail car. High-level platforms allow passengers to board the train much faster, speeding travel times, Noland said. Plans for the project are online at doubletrack-nwi.com.

Sotheby’s. Najeeb Khan, the former owner and head of Interlogic Outsourcing Inc., was accused by KeyBank last year of a multimilion-dollar fraud. Khan later resigned from the company and sold it to Pennylvania-based payroll firm PrimePay. He has also been embroiled in multiple lawsuits by KeyBank and former clients who realized money withdrawn from their accounts for federal tax withholdings was never sent to the Internal Revenue Service. After Khan declared personal bankruptcy in October, a judge ordered that much of Khan’s expansive car collection be sold at auction and the proceeds used to pay his creditors. In total, Khan owns 281 vehicles, according to court records. According to a release from RM Sotheby’s, the “Elkhart Collection” features more than 230 cars, 30 motorcycles, truck, trailers and other memorabilia. “The culmination of decades of careful and targeted collecting of some of the finest motorcars by a single owner, the Elkhart Collection comprises some of the most exceptional marques and models in automotive history,” the release said. The auction will be held in Elkhart on May 1 and 2, and will be offered “almost entirely without reserve,” meaning there is no minimum price to buy some of the cars. They range in value from $10,000 to the “multimillion-dollar mark,” Sotheby’s said in its release. The cars in the collection include a 1903 Clement 12/16 HP Tonneau and a 2006 Ford GT Heritage Edition formerly owned by hockey star Wayne Gretzky. Sotheby’s has not yet released information on all of the cars. “The quality of the cars and the way that the Elkhart Collection has been maintained and looked after is incredible,” Gord Duff, global head of auctions for RM Sotheby’s, said in the release. “The building that they’ve been housed in is much more than a storage facility and has been designed specifically for the care of collector cars.” According to bankruptcy documents, Khan’s combined assets total around $98 million, including the value of the car collection, but his liabilities exceed $126 million. Former IOI clients that have claims against Khan include Catholic dioceses in Charlotte, Raleigh, Palm Beach and New Orleans. Other former clients demanding repayment in the case are home builder Commodore Corporation, and more than 60 former IOI clients represented by the Jones Law Office in South Bend. Khan has not been charged with a crime but is “fully cooperating” with a federal investigation, according to court filings. He allegedly “used his position to perpetrate a significant and ongoing scheme of intentional financial mismanagement against the IOI entities, their customers and their financial institution,” company lawyers wrote in documents included in Khan’s bankruptcy case.'}]"

But as many taxpayers are awaiting their stimulus checks the IRS took a moment to address three common stimulus concerns that taxpayers want to resolve. The IRS “Get My Payment” app says that my economic impact payment was sent to an account I don’t recognize. Why is that, and how do I get my payment? If you had your taxes prepared professionally or prepared them yourself on a DIY tax site, you likely had the option to pay your tax prep or software fees through your refund versus paying them on the spot. Taxpayers have the ability to have fees removed from their refund, or apply for a tax refund advance or loan through using tax refund settlement products. Under-banked taxpayers don’t have to wait on the IRS to mail a check and can also use refund settlement products to have their refunds deposited to a prepaid debit card or pick up a check from their tax preparer more promptly. When using these products, a temporary account is created for the taxpayer by the tax product bank and the refund goes to that account first, then out for disbursement. If you used one of these services, that’s likely the account and routing number you see in the IRS “Get My Payment” app. According to the IRS, if your stimulus payment is sent to one of these accounts, it will be sent back to the IRS and then sent to the taxpayer in the mail. Why am I receiving an error message when entering my personal information or tax information? When entering information, some taxpayers are receiving error messages about their personal info. It’s possible that this is simply from taxpayer error or an information mismatch. First double check the information you are entering, make sure that your input is correct. Consider the address is formatted on the return or enter your address how its formatted by the United States Postal Service. Be sure to match the information you’re entering to that of your last tax return. Enter your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), Refund Amount or Amount Owed directly from your form 1040 or tax transcript. If for some reason it doesn’t accept the 2019 tax return info, try your 2018 tax return instead. I didn’t receive the correct economic impact payment amount. What can I do now? Errors in the amount you were paid doesn’t mean it’s all said and done. Taxpayers who didn’t receive the amount they were entitled to will be able to claim the difference when they file their 2020 tax return next tax season. If they were overpaid based on their return, they also won’t be required to pay it back when they file next year. According to the IRS, those who qualified for a lesser payment amount or didn’t qualify at all based on their 2018 or 2019 tax return may receive the full payment if they qualify for the 2020 tax year. Taxpayers see the difference on their 2020 tax return. Retirement and Disability beneficiaries who weren’t required to file for 2018 or 2019 were able to receive their payments automatically but had to enter dependent information in the “Non-filers-Enter payment Here” tool to get the $500 additional payment for their dependents. This information had to be entered before the “$500 Push” deadlines corresponding with beneficiary type. If they didn’t enter the information wasn’t entered in time, they may still qualify to get the payment later.

The driver they hired napped in their red passenger van as the crew got to work on Tuesday. Speaking mostly in Dutch, the crew of seven toiled under sunny blue skies, putting back together a barn they had recently dismantled on a farm in Ossian, just south of Fort Wayne. [sc:text-divider text-divider-title=”Story continues below gallery” ]Click here to purchase photos from this gallery Dean and Charla Fout were thrilled to watch the work unfold on their 90-acre farm on Grandison Road, just off County Road E. 100 North. Friends and neighbors drove down their long gravel drive to take a closer look throughout the week. The Amish men stood perched atop the framework of the 31-foot-tall barn, skillfully hammering each piece into place. Dressed in dark pants with suspenders and light blue button-down shirts, with straw hats shielding their eyes from the sun, the crew worked methodically to resurrect the 60-by-36-foot red barn. The previous owner had been looking for someone to dismantle and haul the barn away, preferably someone who wanted to reconstruct it elsewhere, so the old barn could continue its purpose somewhere else. She said it had been in her husband’s family for generations. Fout, who had been looking to expand the calving operation on his Charlottesville farm, was happy to oblige. His herd of 22 Angus cattle had outgrown the 24-by-12 foot barn he’d been using for calving. When he found the old barn listed on Facebook, he quickly set into motion a plan to build a walkout basement on his property to set the base for the barn’s new home. He was thrilled to find an Amish crew willing to both dismantle and rebuild the barn, knowing they’d do a fine job of resurrecting the piece of Hoosier history on his property. “It’s amazing to watch them work,” said Fout, who works full-time as the security manager at Covance in Greenfield. “They carve each wood stake by hand, whittling them down from a block of wood,” he said. Crew leader Johnny Schwartz said the wood stakes driven into the old wood beams are stronger than contemporary metal hardware. This was the fourth barn reconstruction project for Schwartz, who owns JB Roofing & Construction in Ohio. He and his crew typically do roofing work, but he loves the chance to rebuild historic old barns, he said. “I think they’re a lot better, a lot stronger than newer barns,” he said. “These old barns are built with pride; they’re meant to last. They’ll last forever if they don’t leak.” When dismantling Fout’s barn last month, Schwartz’s crew carefully labeled each piece — attaching a small white numbered tag to each one. They sketched out a map to show how each piece would fit back together. Last week they arrived to lay out the pieces on the ground of Fout’s property. On Tuesday they reassembled the framing, tying a rope around each section before lowering them into place with a crane. On Wednesday they once again made the two-hour drive to set the roof trusses into place. BASC Construction, a Charlottesville company owned by Fout’s friend, Brad Henderson, is overseeing the project and will soon add a new metal roof. Fout’s son Evan’s company, Fout Concepts, is overseeing the project design. Fout will likely power-wash the original wood exterior and repaint it white, to match the other white barns with green roofs on his property. “I want it to blend in while preserving its historic look,” said Fout, a lifelong Hancock County resident. He and his wife have lived on the family farm since 1993. Fout had no intention of becoming a cattle farmer until his sons Evan, 26, and Cole, 24, showed an interest in showing cattle as teens at the local 4-H fair. “All 22 head of cattle we have came from the heifers the boys showed in 4-H and their offspring,” said Fout, who’s thrilled to move the growing calving operation into the stately historic barn. He was also thrilled about the price tag. Including paying the original owner $4,000 for the barn, the cost to dismantle, transport and rebuild it will cost about $100,000, said Fout, compared to building a comparable new barn for close to $180,000. The barn should be complete in time for calving season in early January, he said. Nobody covers Hancock County like the Daily Reporter. 22 W.

The four Disney Star Wars movies alone grossed more than $4.8 billion at the box office. That figure doesn’t even count any monies generated by the franchise in merchandising or at the theme parks, which opened in 2019. What would you think if I were to tell you that the Disney/Star Wars merger was not the first “big idea” to land on the House of The Mouse doorstep? There was another big idea that was nearly floated out of Anaheim over fifty years ago. And this one came from “Uncle Walt” himself. Well, to paraphrase Winnie the Pooh, Walt Disney’s rumbly tummy anyway. Believe it or not, there was a time when Disneyland and McDonald’s nearly partnered up. This was not a proposal made by a couple of opportunistic bandwagon jumpers; there was history behind this love affair. Walt Disney and Ray Kroc first met in a Connecticut Army camp in 1918 while both were teenaged dreamers known only to their families. Both men were born near Chicago, Illinois less than a year apart. Walter Elias Disney was born in Chicago’s Hermosa neighborhood on December 5, 1901 and Ray Albert Kroc in Oak Park, Illinois, on October 5, 1902. In mid-1918, Walt Disney dropped out of high school at 16 and attempted to join the United States Army to fight against the Germans, but he was rejected because he was too young. Undeterred, Disney forged the date on his birth certificate and joined the Red Cross in September 1918 as an ambulance driver. Ironically, Walt began his ambulance corps training at a burned down amusement park near the University of Chicago where he was taught by mechanics from the Yellow Cab Company how to repair motors and drive cars over rough terrain. Likewise, Ray Kroc dropped out of school, lied about his age and joined the Red Cross as an ambulance driver at the age of 15. Disney was shipped to France, arriving in November, after the Armistice. The only action Disney participated in was drawing cartoons on the side of ambulances. As for Kroc, the war ended shortly after he enlisted. In his 1977 autobiography Grinding It Out: The Making of McDonald’s, Ray Kroc said this about his old war buddy, “In my company, which assembled in Connecticut for training, was another fellow who had lied about his age to get in. He was regarded as a strange duck, because whenever we had time off and went out on the town to chase girls, he stayed in camp drawing pictures. His name was Walt Disney.” While training to be a driver in Ambulance Company A, Disney and Kroc became friends. Ironically, at the same time, a couple of young idealistic writers, also from Chicago, were serving in the ambulance corps; Ernest Hemingway and John Dos Passos. These four men shared not only an occupation but a desire to revolutionize American writing, entertainment and pop culture. However, this article ain’t that deep and talking about Hemingway and Dos Passos is above my pay grade. This article is about pop culture at it’s finest. After Ray and Walt returned to the U.S. independently, they both headed out to Southern California seeking fame and fortune — Disney as an animator, even though the cartoon industry was headquartered in New York City, and Kroc as a businessman, even though California was still a relative backwater in the business world. Disney struggled for a time but finally caught on in 1928 with a cartoon about a mouse called “Steamboat Willie” — the first cartoon with synchronized sound. For Kroc, it would take a little bit longer for his ship to come in — 26 years to be specific. Disney’s story is well known, but Kroc’s story might be worth a revisit. Kroc was working as a traveling salesman for the Mixmaster Corporation when he met two brothers who were tearing it up in San Bernardino. Richard and Maurice “Mac” McDonald, who curiously shared the same middle name (James), developed a restaurant using what they called the “Speedee Service System.” The new restaurant proved a rousing success, especially with teenagers, and the brothers were soon making $40,000 a year, big money back then. By 1953, the brothers had set their sights on franchising with a goal of making $1 million before they turned 50. Their first step was to buy eight shiny new milkshake machines. Curious why one business would need eight machines, Ray visited the McDonalds’, took one glance at the brothers’ method of cooking hamburgers assembly-line-style to get the food out to the customers more quickly, and he immediately saw dollar signs. In 1954, the McDonald brothers partnered with Ray Kroc. Around this same time (April 1954) Walt Disney unveiled his plans for a bold new concept in family fun parks he planned to call Disneyland. As soon as Ray Kroc heard the news about this new mega-fun park, he knew that hungry teenagers would flock to it by the carload. Kroc knew that he’d finally found the perfect place to build his first McDonald’s franchise. In late 1954, Ray sent a letter to his old ambulance corps buddy, it read, in part, “Dear Walt . . . I look over the Company A picture we had taken in Sound Beach, Conn. many times and recall a lot of pleasant memories.” Then Kroc cut to the chase, “I have very recently taken over the national franchise of the McDonald’s system. I would like to inquire if there may be an opportunity for a McDonald’s in your Disneyland Development.” Walt responded cordially to the former Red Cross ambulance driver’s note by saying that he would be handing the proposal over to the Disneyland executive in charge of concessions. Walt explained that he was “currently confining his activities to the creative side” while the Disney Company “raced to complete the theme park on time.” The Disney Archives has a copy of Kroc’s letter and Walt’s response. Kroc claimed he never received a response from the vice president in charge of concessions. From there, well, nobody knows. For the answer, you need look no further than the fact that there are no McDonald’s at Disney. It should be noted that there were some franchise restaurants in Disneyland during those first first years. They included the Aunt Jemima pancake and waffle house in Frontierland and the Chicken of the Sea Pirate Ship in Fantasyland. To his dying day, Ray Kroc insisted that the reason the “world’s first McDonald’s” was not featured inside Disneyland at the park’s July 17, 1955 grand opening was because the head of concessions had tried to force Ray to raise the price of his french fries by a nickle (from 10 cents to 15 cents) for the Disneyland crowd. Kroc, the man in charge of McDonald’s franchising, believed that he was being charged a franchise fee by virtue of Walt Disney Productions tacking on a concessionaire’s fee. Kroc, the consummate businessman, said he wasn’t about to give away a third of his profits while gouging his customers. Great story, but by the time Disneyland debuted, Kroc had only opened one McDonald’s franchise (in Des Plaines, Illinois on April 15, 1955). So he had no loyal customers to offend . . . yet. Well, no customers within 2,000 miles anyway. It is more likely to say that while the executives in charge of Disneyland’s concessions were undoubtedly intrigued by Ray’s “fast food” proposal, and “war buddy” or not, Kroc just didn’t have enough experience in the restaurant business to take that gamble. So, despite how Kroc spun the tale to reporters from the 1950s forward, while there was some discussion of putting a McDonald’s inside the theme park, the project never really made it past the talking stage. But Ray Kroc would never let the truth stand in the way of a good story. Ray Kroc eventually bought the brothers out in 1961, a year after Walt Disney received TWO stars on the Hollywood walk of fame: one for movies, the other for television. All business partnership questions aside, the parallels between the two men continued. Both men were vehement conservative Republicans. Disney famously wore a Barry Goldwater for President pin to the White House in 1964 when President Lyndon B. Johnson presented the Presidential medal of Freedom to the animator. Kroc donated $255,000 to Richard Nixon’s reelection campaign in 1972, and was accused by some, including N.J. Senator Harrison Williams, of trying to influence Nixon to veto a minimum wage bill making its way through Congress (which was then $1.60 per hour,'}]"

As of Jan. 1, 2020, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (DAA) for Fiscal Year 2019 allows service-disabled veterans, former prisoners of war and Purple Heart recipients, in addition to VA-designated caregivers, access to most MWR (morale, welfare and recreation) facilities and programs on base. The Greene County Daily World reached out to NSA Crane Public Affairs Officer Jeffree Nagan to provide a more detailed explanation of what this access means for local veterans. Nagan said after the approval of the DAA, Crane leadership met to discuss what exactly that means for impacted veterans and how they can best utilize their access to the base. \x93NSA Crane cares about those who serve. Whether they served two years or 20 years, we want to give them a place to take advantage of the opportunities available to them,\x94 Nagan explained. The DAA gives veterans and designated caregivers access to non-appropriate funded programs, which includes most MWR facilities on base. In addition to the programs laid out in the DAA, Crane leadership have also extended some availabilities to the approved veterans, such as access to Lake Greenwood, which includes camping, cabins and boating. With a state-issued fishing license and the MWR-issued fishing permits available on base, the approved veterans will be able to fish on the lake. They must check in and out of the kiosk in the Environmental Education Center \x93Under the act, fishing is not prohibited, but it\x92s also not offered,\x94 Nagan said, noting this was an added benefit put in place by Crane leadership. Another added privileged included at Crane base is archery hunting. \x93NSA Crane is known in the area as a good place to hunt. Though it is not included under this act, our leadership wanted to extend hunting privileges. Though, it is only archery and in designated areas,\x94 Nagan explained. \x93This is something we think many veterans will take advantage of.\x94 The individual must have a state-issued hunting license and MWR-issued hunting permit. The DAA also allows access to the VA Telehealth Clinic on base, which is a satellite clinic that allows veterans to meet with medical professionals without making the long drive to the closest VA clinic. \x93This is not a full clinic. It is meant to make acute diagnoses without having to make the trip to a VA clinic,\x94 Nagan explained. Veterans must already be approved to enter the base under the DAA, and have to make an appointment before visiting the clinic by calling 317-988-2514. In addition, the DAA allows the approved veteran to sponsor up to three individuals who are not disabled veterans to come on base with the individual or approved healthcare provider. Nagan explained this means the veteran can bring along the designated caregiver plus up to three others, but the veteran has to bee with the sponsored individuals at all times and the veteran is responsible for their actions. Nagan noted as NSA Crane familiarizes itself with the impact of the DAA on the base, they may make adjustments without notice to ensure the security of the base. How can veterans gain access to base? While the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (DAA) for Fiscal Year 2019 allows local veterans access to military bases, including the local Naval Support Activity Crane, there are some steps to take before gaining access. NSA Crane Public Affairs Officer Jeffree Nagan provided information upon request regarding the steps to gain access specifically to NSA Crane. First, the qualifying veteran, which includes service-disabled veterans, former prisoners of war and Purple Heart recipients, must have a Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC) issued by the VA. Nagan noted it is important for the VHIC to show their eligibility status in order to qualify under the DAA. In addition, designated caregivers for disabled veterans must obtain an eligibility letter from the VA. Nagan noted most of the access and information needed apply to both the approved veteran and VA-designated caregiver. These individuals must also go through processing and vetting before being approved access to the base. In order to start processing, the veteran and caregiver must go to the NSA Crane Visitors Center during business hours, and bring along two forms of identification, which can include their VHIC and/or driver\x92s license, and complete a SECNAV form 5512/1. Veterans, as well as caregivers, will then have a background check that includes the sex offender registry, NCIC, FBI and criminal history to search for any active warrants. In addition, There will be a Department of Defense debarment order check. If driving on the base, the individual must also have their driver\x92s license, registration and proof of insurance. For veterans and their caregivers, the vetting process must be redone annually. If a non-veteran or caregiver is being sponsored, they must also meet the same criteria and fill out the SECNAV form 5512/1, but they must be vetted every 180 days at the Visitors Center or Crane Gate Once all of the criteria is met, approved veterans, under the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act, will have access to commissary and exchange, and most Moral, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) opportunities on base.

This particular young man set out on a two-day murder spree. Wearing a ski mask and armed with a knife, he killed four people, including a geriatric couple, in their own homes. When finally apprehended and interrogated, the man was happy to admit to the killings and his eerie reasoning behind them—he wanted nothing more than to become a famous serial killer. This case and others like it have sparked a national conversation. In recent years, The New York Times has asked “How Should the News Media Cover Mass Shooters?” followed by Los Angeles Times, which posed the question “Are the Media Complicit in Mass Shootings?” The answer is simple: by giving a name and identity to mass murderers, media organizations are handing these murderers the fame they desire on a silver platter, as well as encouraging copycats who crave the same fame. In a 2018 study conducted by Brad J. Bushman, it was found that narcissistic traits largely drive the psychology and behavior of mass shooters. Moreover, the study demonstrated that media outlets provide a stage for narcissistic individuals to become “stars” through extreme acts of violence, such as mass murders. Media coverage of mass killers rewards the perpetrators with infamy, acts as an incentive for future fame-seekers to commit violent acts, and even provides a reason for these mass murderers to kill as many victims as possible in order to obtain more media attention. The FBI, the International Police Association, victims’ families, and even media organization members themselves have released statements calling on media organizations to quit publishing the names and photographs of mass murderers. Instead of plastering a mass murderer’s name and photograph on every television news program and on the front page of each newspaper, the media should shift their focus; direct attention to the victims of the crime. Talk about the wounded. Put a spotlight on the heroes. Stop naming the murderers. Stop identifying the killers in these mass murders. Stop handing them the publicity they desire. Stop making them famous.

has changed a lot of things in 2020. However, it might spur a renewed interest in Christmas Light Tours because a family can jump in the car and drive around to see holiday magic without the worry of social distancing. The tradition has sparked a website to help those interested in seeing elaborate holiday light displays \x96www.christmaslightfinder.com. When searching the website for the Clay County area, there aren\x92t any local displays in the database. That is why The Brazil Times staff is organizing a list of local displays to help people interested in taking a light tour this year, not to drive around looking for them aimlessly. We have a few so far, including: 8427 N St Rd 59, Brazil 424 East Oak Street, Brazil 503 N Meridian Street, Brazil 689 W Emerald Drive, Brazil 1300 Block of North Forest Lane, Brazil 8440 N St Andrew\x92s Glen, Brazil 8270 N St Andrews Drive, Brazil There are also several displays along North Murphy Avenue, north of Brazil. A few displays are still in the works, including 689 W. Emerald, Brazil. Of course, Forest Park is aglow with holiday lights, and local businesses have or are also in the work of creating light displays. But, we know more displays, big or small, new or old, out there that will make the young at heart smile and conjure up memories of the holiday past. To add your display to the list, call The Times Office at 812-446-2216.

Johnson hung the very first string of 80 red, white, and blue hand-wired electric lights together and wound them around his Christmas tree. The tree was placed on a trunk with a revolving pedestal, all powered by a generator. The lights drew a crowd, who stopped to peer at the glowing marvel. It was the start of a tradition and the practice of doing more each year. Johnson\x92s display the next year had 120 lights. As light displays became a favorite event during the holidays, the advent of cars allowed people to travel to see the best. However, it\x92s a bit unclear about the date or whom to give credit for the mobile light tour\x92s idea during the holidays. During the 1910s, the National Electric Lamp Company, ultimately bought out by General Electric, in Cleveland purchased an abandoned vineyard seven miles outside Cleveland and construction began for Nela Park, the first industrial park in the world, featuring electricity. In 1925 the campus began sponsoring outdoor Christmas displays, with \x93Yuletide Greetings\x94 signage across the engineering building\x92s rooftop. By the third year, the lighting designers added searchlights and twinkling stars. Local residents had started making pilgrimages by automobiles to Nela Park, stopping just outside the gates to sit and watch in wonder as the lights changed. With time the Nela designers wanted to build more interest. They created a drive-through plan where families could see lighted Christmas trees and small scenes as they traveled through the property. The company sponsored design contests for the employees, which increased excitement about each year\x92s new plan. Like most of the rest of the country, Nela Park went dark during World War II. The holiday tradition did not resume until 1949. However, Nela Park\x92s prominence was evident by the 1950s, when Bing Crosby appeared to sing \x93White Christmas\x94 at the opening of the holiday season. The tradition of outdoor holiday lighting established at Nela Park had a firm foothold throughout the country by the 1960s. Outlining the house in lights, stringing lights through trees, and lacing them through bushes became popular, along with elaborate holiday scenes and lighted reindeer, all of which delight passersby.
