That number includes a little-seen 1954 TV adaptation of Ian Fleming\'s first 007 book, Casino Royale, which was published just a year earlier. That same work has shown up as two other films over the next five decades. We outline the Stories Behind All 26 James Bond Movies below, revealing the history and secrets of the longest-running franchise in film history. \'Casino Royale\' (1954) The first adaptation of Ian Fleming\'s James Bond was an episode of the TV anthology series Climax! Played by Barry Nelson, the protagonist is referred to as ""Jimmy,"" not James Bond, and is Americanized in the teleplay. The show also featured Peter Lorre as the villain, Le Chiffre. Due to the novel\'s rights being sold prior to the combined production relationship between Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, Casino Royale would be adapted again in the late \'60s as a satire starring David Niven as James Bond. In 1999, MGM agreed to pay $5 million to Sony Pictures Entertainment to cement its rights to the entire Bond franchise, as well as to obtain the rights to Casino Royale. Read More: Sean Connery Was Not the First James Bond \'Dr. No\' (1962) Few movies debut as ""franchise-ready"" as Dr. No did, even though the Hollywood of the \'60s wasn\'t as obsessed with universe-building as it is now. The first James Bond 007 film was made by Eon Productions, a union between rivals Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman that merged to secure the rights to Ian Fleming\'s literary output. In Dr. No, Bond (Sean Connery) is sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a fellow agent. In so doing, Bond, with the help of Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress), foils the nefarious Dr. No\'s (Joseph Wiseman) plans for world domination. Almost all the pieces are in place: James Bond\'s inclinations for action and lust, broad-brush villains, massive villain lairs (designed by series regular Ken Adam), Bond girls and the iconic theme song written by Monty Norman, complete with instantly recognizable twangy guitar over the top. Read More: How \'Dr. No\' Launched James Bond and Changed Moviegoing Forever \'From Russia With Love\' (1963) One year later, James Bond returned in From Russia With Love, again featuring the hard-edged Connery as well as Dr. No director Terence Young. Bond is dispatched to enable the defection of Soviet consulate clerk Tatiana Romanova. Agents of SPECTRE Donald Grant (Robert Shaw) and Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya) attempt to subvert the defection and take possession of a code-breaking Lektor machine, the bargaining chip for Romanova. At the time, America\'s fascination with Bond was in full force, with President John F. Kennedy stating From Russia With Love was one of his favorite novels. Production was put into high gear to capitalize on the fervor. However, production designer Ken Adam could not participate because he was working on Stanley Kubrick\'s Dr. Strangelove, so Dr. No art director Syd Cain filled in. Two important pieces of the Bond cinematic team arrive with From Russia With Love: Composer John Barry provides the score for the film and will be integral to the series until the \'80s, and Desmond Llewellyn makes his first appearance as MI6\'s quartermaster Major Boothroyd, known in later installments simply as ""Q."" Read More: Why James Bond\'s \'From Russia With Love\' Still Packs a Punch \'Goldfinger\' (1964) If James Bond was a sensation after From Russia With Love, he was a full-fledged phenomenon after Goldfinger. It was the first movie helmed by action director Guy Hamilton and introduced a few new wrinkles that would stay within the Bond fabric. Auric Goldfinger plans to contaminate the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, bathing the gold in nuclear radiation and making it inaccessible for a lifetime. This would instantly make Goldfinger\'s horde of gold the dominant international gold cache and, by extension, make him the leader of the world. It\'s up to Bond to stop him, his henchman Oddjob and chemical weapons expert Pussy Galore. Goldfinger introduces some of the campy aspects that the Bond series would be known for later and also eases the main character\'s behavior toward women. While hardly a champion against misogyny, previous outings showed Bond as likely to kill women as kiss them. With this edition, he\'s far more inclined toward the latter. Another trope that comes into its own in Goldfinger is the archenemy monologue. While seen in part in the previous films, Goldfinger ups the ante as he reveals his insidious plot while Bond, tied to a metal table. has a laser slowly inching toward his crotch. Bond defiantly asks, ""You expect me to talk?"" Goldfinger scoffs, ""No, Mr. Bond! I expect you to die!"" Read More: 55 Years Ago: ‘Goldfinger’ Helps Define the James Bond Film \'Thunderball\' (1965) Behind the scenes, the Bond series always dealt with conflict. The alliance between Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli was strictly a marriage of convenience to secure and maintain the rights to Ian Fleming\'s literary catalog. Likewise, not all of Fleming\'s works were 100 percent his. Thunderball was initially a movie script based on an original story by Fleming, Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham, developed before the Eon Productions deal. When that production fell through, Fleming wrote a novel based on the script\'s story elements. In 1961, McClory and Whittingham sued Fleming, claiming partial authorship. The lawsuit was settled out of court. McClory retained certain screen rights to the novel\'s story, plot and characters, and this chip would be cashed in as 1983\'s Never Say Never Again. Such compromises would also cause Casino Royale, initially sold for the 1954 teleplay, to be out of Eon Productions\' control. Read More: 55 Years Ago: ‘Thunderball’ Takes James Bond Fun to New Heights \'You Only Live Twice\' (1967) Heralded in 1967 as Sean Connery\'s final go-round as James Bond, You Only Live Twice pits the Americans versus the Russians in a high-stakes standoff over mutual spacecraft disappearing in orbit. Meanwhile, MI6 believes it is a trap created by SPECTRE to pit the two superpowers against each other, resulting in chaos and allowing the enemy force to take control after the two nations have battered each other down to size. You Only Live Twice offers the first look at the face of SPECTRE\'s kingpin, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. (Before, only his hand was seen petting his cat.) The screenplay was adapted by novelist Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), who would also work with producer Broccoli on the adaptation of Fleming\'s children\'s book Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

After Ratoff\'s death, the rights were passed on to Charles K. Feldman, who subsequently produced the satirical Bond spoof Casino Royale starring David Niven as Bond, Woody Allen as Jimmy Bond - in a nod to the TV version - and Peter Sellers as yet another James Bond. This edition of Casino Royale is a product of its time, less interested in being Bond-like than in being groovy and madcap. Ursula Andress, previously Honey Ryder in Dr. No, appears as Vesper Lynd. And in a feat of inspired casting, Orson Welles plays the villainous Le Chiffre.

Eon had originally planned to shoot The Man With the Golden Gun in Cambodia with Roger Moore taking up the James Bond mantel. But the Vietnam War made that impossible, and Moore left, albeit temporarily, the world of James Bond. Why Lazenby? Eon wanted a new actor it could groom for stardom, rather than a big name that might overshadow the Bond character. (Moore was already a TV star.) Lazenby had a similar build to Sean Connery, meaning costumes and props could be reused. More importantly, producer Harry Saltzman liked Lazenby\'s confidence, seeing it as sufficiently Bond-like. The big twist of On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service is Bond\'s romance and marriage to Countess Tracy DiVincenzo. The role was played by Diana Rigg, fresh from her career-making role of super-agent Emma Peel on TV\'s The Avengers. The movie attempts to have it both ways, edging toward the peace-love counterculture while also driving Bond back to his tough-guy persona from Fleming\'s books. Lazenby\'s personal inclinations were more toward the former. That, coupled with his arrogance that had been considered a virtue earlier, made him difficult to work with. The final nail in Lazenby\'s 007 coffin was not that the movie underperformed at the box office (it did), but that he felt the role was beneath him,'}]"
