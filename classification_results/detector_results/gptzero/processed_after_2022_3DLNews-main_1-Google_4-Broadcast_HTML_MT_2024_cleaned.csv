Martin Gary F. Martin was born on June 4, 1936 to parents Francis L. Martin and Velva Mae(Major) Martin in Williston, North Dakota. He was the oldest of six brothers: Robert, Thomas, Dennis, Lyle, Douglas and William.

Gary attended Minot State College before entering the U.S. Army in 1955. He trained in Fort Chaffee, Arkansas and Fort Sill, Oklahoma before shipping to Germany. He served in Germany until 1957 when he was called home to Williston, North Dakota when his mother passed away at the age of 42. Six weeks later his father died, also at age 42. At 20 years old he was left with six younger brothers ages 18 to 18 months. He was Honorably Discharged at Fort Riley, Kansas in August 1957. While home for his father’s funeral Gary met Judi Scarr who was a student at Concordia College, Moorhead, Minnesota. In 1958 Judi began teaching in Grenora, North Dakota. Gary married the love of his life, Judi Scarr in 1959. The fall of 1959 Judi obtained a teaching position in the Dickinson, North Dakota school system. Gary entered Dickinson State College in1959.

In 1962 Gary and Judi moved to Culbertson, Montana where Gary taught and coached winning Championships in Football and Basketball. In 1966 Gary received his Master’s Degree in School Administration at Montana State University, Bozeman. He was named Superintendent of the Culbertson School System that same year and served as their Superintendent until 1972. Their daughter Lisa Lynn (1964) and Robert Gary (1968) were born in Culbertson. In 1972 Gary was named the Superintendent of Schools in Glasgow. He served as Superintendent there for 27 years until the summer of 1999. During this time North Star School was opened at the Glasgow Air Force Base serving the Air Force, Mountain Plains programs and later the Family Training Center families. Enrollment in the Glasgow School System exceeded 2000 students. During this time the HS football field was moved from the Fairgrounds to its present location along with an all-weather track, lights, bleachers, concession stands and restrooms. Additional classrooms were added to the Eastside Elementary School along with remodeling to transfer that school into a Middle School concept. The grade organizational pattern was changed to a K-5, 6,7,8 and a 9-12 grouping. New shops were constructed at the High School. The old Jr. High School was demolished for safety purposes. The old shop facilities were remodeled into a boardroom, administrative offices and district warehouses along with bus barns. New bleachers were added at the High School, remodeled locker rooms, additional restrooms were added in the gymnasium area and two new scoreboards installed. Gary was proud of these accomplishments. Gary was also very proud of the Glasgow Community support and tradition of the schools, the best school song and the reputation of the Glasgow School System. He appreciated the dedicated school board members, his administrative staff, the teachers, coaches, and all of their efforts for the Glasgow students. Gary was a member of the American School Administrators, Montana School Administrators of which he served as president and Phi Delta Kappa educational organization. Gary was on the original team from Montana that enabled the Montana Schools to participate in Close Up for students to visit Washington D.C. and an original organizer of the Valley County Crisis Line. Gary was a member of First Lutheran Church in Glasgow and the Kiwanis Club for many years. Gary loved to travel with his wife and best friend, Judi and family especially to Mexico where they were involved in a Mission and summers at Flathead Lake. Gary and Judi spent many winters in Arizona where Gary played on a softball team for men over 55. He loved spending time with his beloved family especially his prized grandchildren: Jordan, Austin, Macy Kay and Reece. Gary was a loving husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, athlete, teacher, coach, administrator, Notre Dame, Yankee and Scottie fan, and a loyal friend. Gary was also known for his quick wit and awesome sense of humor. Gary was preceded in death by his and Judi’s twin babies, his parents, Velva and Francis Martin and all of his younger brothers: Robert, Thomas, Dennis, Lyle, Douglas and William, his parents-in-law, Harold and Judythe Scarr and several sisters and brothers-in-law. Gary is survived by his loving wife, Judi of 65 years, his most loved children: daughter, Lisa Martin Hines (Randy), son Robert Gary Martin (Brooke), his grandchildren Jordan Hines Wenzel (Zach), Austin Hines, Macy Martin and Reece Martin and several special nieces and nephews.

The Missoula Redevelopment Agency pitched the city project to the Montana Board of Investments on Tuesday and was granted a bond worth $2.8 million under a new state program. “The loan committee approved our request for $2.8 million for the Ravara housing project,” Annie Gorski told the Missoula Current on Thursday. “This is really another milestone – a step forward towards being able to start construction on this project. It’s another piece of funding the project.” The state bond is a key piece of the project’s overall funding formula and is included in a $9.8 million bond to cover project costs. The City Council must approve all bond requests and is expected to discuss the measure in the coming weeks. The funding will help build a workforce housing project off Scott Street and its associated infrastructure, including roads and utilities. It will also cover a funding gap between the true cost of building the workforce housing and selling it to households earning around 120% of the area median income. “A project of this scale requires a lot of different programs,” Gorski said. “It’s a big deal to leverage state funding, tax increment, local bank funding and other sources to make this project happen. This project would not happen but for all of these different programs being leveraged.” The city purchased 19 acres off Scott Street in 2020 for $6.6 million. Roughly nine acres of the property, which was formerly home to White Pine Sash, was cleaned to residential standards and will soon be redeveloped into a blend of workforce and market-rate housing. Of the nine acres set aside for housing, three will be broken off and placed into a community land trust. Current plans for that portion of the project call for 89 for-sale units, including 46 income-restricted units. The city has partnered with Ravara to complete the project. To help build the market-rate portion of the project and its necessary infrastructure, MRA approached the Montana Board of Investments in hopes of landing the Housing Infrastructure Revolving Loan Bond. At the same time, MRA’s board of commissioners last month recommended approving a bond not to exceed $9.8 million to round out the project costs. Broken down, around $5.7 million from the city bond will cover additional infrastructure costs, such as street extensions, utilities, lighting and landscaping, among other things. The remaining $4 million covers the funding gap for workforce housing. Now that MRA has received the state bond – and if the City Council approves the city bond – Ravara will likely start construction this spring. “The first piece will likely begin in March.

The report described Biden as a “sympathetic,” “well-meaning” and elderly man with ""poor memory"" and accused him of forgetting major events such as the day his son Beau died. It provided these details in an effort to explain why the special counsel declined to recommend charges against the president. President Biden aggressively decried these allegations during a sudden press conference Thursday night, insisting to reporters “my memory is fine.” Moments later, President Biden confused the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, giving further fodder to Americans skeptical of Biden\'s mental acuity. Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Friday she still fears “the potential for a second term for former President Donald Trump,” according to WGHN. She explained there is “a lot at stake” in November’s election and urged voters to stand by Biden throughout the shock generated by the report.

Dean Phillips, D-Minn., told Fox News the report bolsters Donald Trump\'s chances of returning to the White House and should be a wake-up call for Democrats. An anonymous Democratic House member told NBC News the report made their worst fears come true. “It’s a nightmare,” the member told the outlet. “It weakens President Biden electorally, and Donald Trump would be a disaster and an authoritarian. For Democrats, we’re in a grim situation.” A House Democrat reportedly told Axios that the special counsel report is ""obviously concerning,"" and another reportedly replied ""oy vey"" when reacting to the report\'s contents. Biden, 81, has long faced scrutiny over his cognitive abilities. These concerns reached a fever pitch this week as the president repeatedly blundered the names of current world leaders at campaign fundraising events, claiming to have spoken with Germany’s Helmut Kohl at the 2021 G7 Summit despite the former world leader having passed away.
