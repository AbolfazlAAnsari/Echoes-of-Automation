One notorious player in this underworld is Tamil Rockers, a website infamous for uploading newly released movies on the very day they hit theaters. This article delves into the intricate web of piracy, its impact on the film industry, the challenges faced by authorities, and the eventual downfall of Tamil Rockers. India’s Copyright Act of 1957 stands as a sentinel against the theft of creative works. Individuals found guilty of pirating or selling copyrighted materials can face a fine of three lakh Indian Rupees and a prison sentence of three months. Despite these stringent measures, illegal websites like Tamil Rockers continue to thrive, offering easy access to pirated content. Tamil Rockers emerged as a notable player within the Bootleg Recording Network (BRN), a realm where audio and video recordings are illicitly shared before their official release. The act of capturing and distributing such materials, termed bootlegging, saw hidden cameras capturing movies within theaters. The recordings were then converted into CDs, forming the backbone of this underground enterprise. The film “Shivaji,” featuring the acclaimed southern Indian actor Rajinikanth, became a glaring example of piracy’s ramifications. The movie’s widespread piracy not only permeated the state of Tamil Nadu but also ignited a surge in internet usage. The film’s release prompted theater owners to tighten security by banning cameras, yet resourceful pirates still managed to surreptitiously record and distribute the movie online. Fuelled by overwhelming demand, pirate websites like Tamil Rockers transformed into thriving businesses. The inception of a public torrent website in 2011 further solidified their presence. Indian and Hollywood pirated films found a home on Tamil Rockers, attracting a vast audience. The process of converting videos into high-resolution formats and utilizing powerful CPUs enabled efficient storage and distribution. Tamil Rockers capitalized on peer-to-peer sharing mechanisms, allowing users to download unauthorized content through magnet links and torrent files. The operation necessitated a team of at least 10 individuals, including students covertly recording new releases. The rapid expansion of this network showcased both its profitability and its ability to lure in new recruits. While piracy wreaked havoc on the film industry, it inadvertently created a digital theater for those unable to afford traditional cinema experiences. The authorities’ attempts to curb piracy were met with challenges, as website administrators constantly altered domain names to evade detection. A cold war ensued between Tamil Rockers and film companies, prompting desperate efforts to combat the piracy menace. Despite numerous complaints and reports to law enforcement agencies, the culprits behind Tamil Rockers remained elusive. The website’s revenue generation relied heavily on pop-up advertisements, contributing to their illicit gains. In a significant breakthrough, five individuals, including two owners of Tamil Rockers, were apprehended in March 2018, shedding light on the immense profits reaped from piracy. The culmination of diligent investigative work led to the takedown of Tamil Rockers on October 19, 2020. The website’s reign of piracy came to an end, marking a significant victory for authorities in their battle against online piracy. The tale of Tamil Rockers serves as a testament to the intricate world of online piracy, its impact on industries, and the ongoing struggle to combat it. As technology evolves, so do the methods of piracy, necessitating continuous vigilance to protect intellectual property and creative endeavors. Email: [email protected]'}]"

The fashion is a scarf with one, two or three segments attached with snaps. The statement is respect for the environment. Scalf\'s scarves are created with eco-friendly materials and processes. Cutting and sewing are done with zero waste, which means no fabric ends up in landfills. The scarves can be used over and over again as a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic, another eco-friendly feature. “People were asking me to make fabric masks, but I didn\'t want to contribute to the waste they create. I\'m an environmentally conscious person,“ Scalf said. ""Besides being re-usable, the scarves are functional when you use them as a mask. You don\'t have to deal with putting it on and taking it off. It\'s always on."" A Canton native who has been a fashion designer for more than 10 years, Scalf is the creative director and founder of the Lily Vinita brand. She\'s participated in some of the fashion industry\'s largest shows such as Paris Fashion Week, and her creations have been sold on the Home Shopping Network. Scalf, 35, operates her online business out of her Morton home and The Nest co-working space in Peoria, with hopes of someday opening a brick-and-mortar store. She has one employee and she said she\'s looking for more. Scalf changed the name of her fashion design business from LilyV to Lily Vinita (Vinita is her middle name) earlier this year and changed her focus from custom designed dresses to eco-friendly apparel. According to the Lily Vinita website, Scalf\'s scarves ""are digitally printed on organic natural combed cotton using environmentally friendly dyes and manufacturing processes. The prints are created using a highly saturated, pigment-based, archival ink through inkjet printers that emit a fine mist of tiny ink droplets onto the surface."" Last month, Scalf launched her first scarf collection, which she calls her activist collection. ""I wanted to tap into the political climate,"" she said. Her activist scarves are in skin tones and accented by the phrases, ""Embrace love,"" ""Support kindness"" and ""Empower equality."" They range in price from $29.99 to $69.99 for the full collection, not including shipping and handling. Scalf plans to launch an environment-focused scarf collection with floral prints next month. The Lily Vinita website is www.lilyvinita.com. Steve Stein can be reached at (248) 224-2616 or stevestein21@yahoo.com. Follow him on Twitter @SpartanSteve.'}]"

Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune Customers shop at Pete's Fresh Market in Oak Park March 19, one day before the village is set to 'shelter-in-place' for two weeks. With the village of Oak Park preparing to begin a two-week shelter-in-place order Friday March 20, local grocery stores were experiencing an uptick in shoppers hours before the order was to take effect.On Wednesday March 18, Mayor Anan Abu-Taleb announced the village had issued a shelter-in-place order for its residents, which will last from March 20 through at least April 3.The move came after one of its residents, a man in his 30s, tested positive for the coronavirus, or COVID-19. The man was screened and tested at Rush Oak Park Hospital, but is at home recovering in isolation. Rush Oak Park later announced two of its emergency room doctors have also tested positive for COVID-19. A second Oak Park resident, a woman in her 40s, tested positive March 20.Groceries busy but orderlyAt Carnival Grocery, 824 S. Oak Park Ave., owner Arthur Paris said his store was doing three to four times its normal volume of sales on March 20. Paris also owns Carnival Foods in Lincoln Park.“Yesterday and today, we’ve been extremely busy,” Paris said. “We’ve seen a lot of new faces in the store today. Everybody’s in an upbeat mood though, and it’s a community atmosphere.”Paris said the store was receiving a lot of orders for deliveries, particularly from elderly and disabled people and those who want to stay out of the public. Asia Brown shops at Pete’s Fresh Market in Oak Park on March 19, one day before the village is set to ‘shelter-in-place’ for two weeks. As the village of Oak Park prepares for a shelter-in-place ordinance due to take effect from March 20 through April 3, the shelves at Carnival Grocery, 824 S. Oak Park Ave., remained largely stocked Thursday.“We’re taking care of the ones we can,” Paris said. “The people who do the phone orders with older customers are some very kind human beings. It’s been a lot of work and time consuming.” Store hours at Carnival remain unchanged, Paris said, and he has yet to place limits on certain grocery items.While hand sanitizer, bleach and paper products are sold out, Paris said there are plenty of groceries still on the shelves.“People are very worried about getting their stores restocked,” Paris said. “People didn’t know this was coming so there was no time to increase inventory sizes. Suppliers of perishable goods have been making regular deliveries and getting us a regular amount of goods. It’s non-perishable goods that we had a hard time getting replaced. The store is open for business and we have lots of groceries and fresh produce to sell.” Chamika Moore shops at Pete’s Fresh Market in Oak Park March 19, one day before the village is set to ‘shelter-in-place’ for two weeks..‘Elder hour’ at 7 a.m.At Pete’s Fresh Market, 259 Lake St., executive officer Vanessa Dremonas said volume has noticeably increased since the COVID-19 pandemic began, but says things have been orderly.“Our store has been busier than usual this past week,” Dremonas said. “We have every register open, but we have the crowds under control and are moving people through the store as quickly as possible.”Dremonas said Pete’s is introducing an “elder hour” from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. Monday through Friday for senior citizens to shop, and regular store hours will run from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. for the general public.At Sugar Beet, a community-owned grocery cooperative at 812 Madison St., business has seen a steady increase, according to interim manager Jen Wenschhof-Gallogly.In response, Sugar Beet has also altered its hours of operation. Between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m., the store is open for a “senior and elevated risk” shopping hour, while regular shopping takes place between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. Tatiana Lane (left) and Shantara Barber shop for seniors and people who are under quarantine through Instacart at Pete’s Fresh Market in Oak Park March 19.“We’ve had more customers than normal since March 12,” Wenschhof-Gallogly said. “[We] are concentrating on maintaining the health and safety of our community and their access to food.”Jewel-Osco, which has Oak Park locations at 7036 Roosevelt Road and 438 W. Madison St., had adjusted its daily hours in order to restock and deep clean its stores. Hours of operation are now 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.“We are asking customers to respect quantity limits of select, high-demand items like hand sanitizers and household cleaners to help ensure more of our neighbors can find the products they need,” spokeswoman Mary Frances Trucco said. “We’re refilling high-demand products as quickly as we can.”Shelter order stresses ‘gravity’ of situation, not meant to penalizeWhile the shelter-in-place order is in effect, residents will still be able to leave their homes to visit “essential” services, such as grocery stores, doctor’s offices, food banks, convenience stores, gas stations, etc.“What we are trying to do here is to make people understand the gravity of the situation,” Abu-Taleb said. “In the meantime, we don’t want people to panic.” Customers shop at Pete’s Fresh Market in Oak Park March 19, one day before the village is set to ‘shelter-in-place’ for two weeks.While the language in the order states violations can result in a Class A misdemeanor, Abu-Taleb said the goal is not to arrest people and place them in jail, but rather use the ordinance to explain the gravity of the COVID-19 pandemic.“This is not to penalize people,” Abu-Taleb said. “We are not going to be heavy-handed with enforcement. This is to help people protect themselves and protect others. We are not interested in making it more difficult for people [to live their lives], but we do have staff that will communicate with those folks who may not be taking this as seriously as they should. This is a way to reach out to people who may not know how serious this is and how this virus uses us against one another to harm us.”sschering@pioneerlocal.comTwitter: @steveschering On Wednesday March 18, Mayor Anan Abu-Taleb announced the village had issued a shelter-in-place order for its residents, which will last from March 20 through at least April 3.

CHICAGOâ\x80\x94From its inception in 1979 until today, The Final Call newspaper has consistently delivered a message dedicated to the resurrection of the Black man and woman of America and the world. â\x80\x9cThe Final Call has a unique mission and purpose and when you look back at our first edition, essentially it was about the survival of the Black nation. Forty years later that still is the question, concern and missionâ\x80\x94in particular coming after the first Black president. We have seen a whitelash â\x80¦ a president who has really shown what is deep in the hearts of the people and how vulnerable our people remain,â\x80\x9d said Final Call editor in chief Richard B. Muhammad. (L) The Fruit of Islam (FOI) are the men of the Nation of Islam. (R) The brothers diligently spread the teachings of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad as taught by the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan through The Final Call newspaper. (L) Jr. FOI hold copies of The Final Call dedicated to the late Aretha Franklin. (R) The Final Call newspaper is available in cities around the country. At the upcoming Nation of Islam national convention in Detroit, Savioursâ\x80\x99 Day 2020, Feb. 21-23 in the Motor City, The Final Call will mark 40 years of publishing with a banquet and celebration that will also pay tribute to the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan, the founder and publisher of the award-winning newspaper. The dinner, which is open to the public, will be held Friday, Feb. 21, at the TCF Center Ballroom, in downtown Detroit. The doors will open for the evening program at 6 p.m. EDT. Tickets are $100 and a table of 10 seats is available for $1,000. Individual tickets and table tickets can be ordered atÂ www.noi.org. â\x80\x9cThis will be an incredible night, an historic night and an opportunity to recognize those who have worked hard to establish The Final Call and to show love, appreciation and gratitude to the man whose vision, sacrifice and integrity lie at the cornerstone of any success that Allah and His Christ have allowed us to have,â\x80\x9d said Mr. Muhammad. Dr. Conrad Worrill â\x80\x9cThose of us who read Muhammad Speaks were delighted when we discovered that the Minister was relaunching it under a new masthead, The Final Call, because nowhere else could we get the kind of editorial content that was published in Muhammad Speaks,â\x80\x9d said Dr. Conrad Worrill, chairman emeritus of the National Black United Front (NBUF) and longtime Final Call reader and contributing columnist. Launched in the basement of Minister Farrakhanâ\x80\x99s home in 1979, The Final Call has a reputation in the Black community by being a fearless, uncompromising seeker of truth. The year 2019 marked its 40th year of continuous publication. â\x80\x9cOur people need a voice. They need a guardian, a watchman, someone who will stand and point out these dangers, and contradictions, call us to unity and to the word and mission and the saving message of the most Honorable Elijah Muhammad, which Minister Farrakhan has been delivering to us now for 44 years in the absence of his teacher. An essential part of delivering that message is The Final Call newspaper,â\x80\x9d added Mr. Muhammad. Richard B. Muhammad The Final Call remains Black Americaâ\x80\x99s sole nationally distributed, independent, Black-owned print newspaper. It also has a digital edition and an active presence on social media platforms. But before social media that brought news to people across the country in real time, The Final Call had reporters and writers connecting the dots by showing Black people in New York what was happening in Los Angeles and vice versa and covering all in between. In 1996, The Final Call amplified the three-part series by investigative reporter Gary Webb of the San Jose Mercury News that exposed a cocaine distribution network connected to the Central Intelligence Agency and the Nicaraguan Contras that helped ignite the South Central Los Angeles crack epidemic and feed the drug crisis in different parts of the country. â\x80\x9cThe Final Call is really the only national weekly Black newspaper that we have in the United States,â\x80\x9d said Dr. Ray Winbush, director of the Institute for Urban Research at Morgan State University. â\x80\x9cThe Final Call gives me news I canâ\x80\x99t see anywhere else. Whether it was Trayvon Martin, the massacre in Charleston, and other similar events, The Final Call went into depth in these stories. Other publications just reported the facts, but The Final Call puts things into historical context.â\x80\x9d â\x80\x9cAdditionally, I love the repetition of What the Muslims Want section. Since the days of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, the Muslims have been consistent on reparations. To repeat that every week reminds us of the task still ahead of us,â\x80\x9d added Dr. Winbush. The FOI work hard spreading a kind word and sharing Islam through The Final Call newspaper which is an award-winning independent Black-weekly that was founded by the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan. The Final Call enjoys a growing customer base and is available in print and in digital. The Final Call championed the wrongly convicted, many rotting in jail for decades, long before mainstream media took notice. â\x80\x9cLast year I was staring death in the face but I am alive to keep fighting. I know it was due in large part to the support of Minister Farrakhan and the story that appeared in The Final Call newspaper. The Final Call helped to save my life. Without that story my plight would not have spread as fast and my wrongful execution would have been carried out in darkness,â\x80\x9d said Reggie Clemons in a Final Call interview referring to an article the newspaper published in June 2009. Furthermore, Minister Farrakhan has been able to send reporters overseas to conferences and to get firsthand accounts of international issues affecting Black people. â\x80\x9cThanks to the brothers selling the paper, we are the only Black newspaper with the resources to send reporters throughout the world. We went to Switzerland to cover our peopleâ\x80\x99s fight against genocide, Sudan to cover the North vs South issues, to Liberia to cover the war, to Kenya to investigate AIDSâ\x80\x99 treatment discovery, to Zimbabwe to cover the land dispute and many more issues, events and conferences in South Africa, Nigeria, and Ghana,â\x80\x9d said James G. Muhammad, a former Final Call editor in chief. He continues to work for the institution he helped build as a valuable and active contributing editor. â\x80\x9cThe Final Call is the best paper in America. Not only Black America, itâ\x80\x99s the best. It covers news that not only White newspapers but other Black papers donâ\x80\x99t cover,â\x80\x9d said Rev. Albert Sampson, a Chicago-based pastor, activist and longtime friend of Minister Farrakhan. â\x80\x9cIt has no corporate advertising and the distribution is phenomenal,â\x80\x9d he said. Snoop Dogg, Nas and Steve Harvey checking out The Final Call which hit a milestone in celebrating 40 years in publishing. On Friday, Feb. 21 at Savioursâ\x80\x99 Day in Detroit there will be a celebratory banquet to recognize four decades of publishing and to pay tribute to Min. Farrakhan.""}]"

The early-morning fire was contained to the top two stories of the building, at 504 S. Rawlings St. Investigators believed the fire was the result of arson, but a suspect was never identified. The Carbondale Police Department currently lists the fire as a cold case. Javascript is required for you to be able to read premium content. Please enable it in your browser settings. According to a Southern Illinoisan story the day after the fire, some residents suffered multiple fractures after jumping out of windows of the three-story building. One woman\'s pelvis was crushed when she landed. ""It was a long way down,"" then- Jackson County coroner Dr. Jerry Thurman told The Southern following the fire. ""I\'m amazed that more people weren\'t killed."" The day after the fire, the front page of The Southern listed four of the five eventual victims who died in the fire: Cheng Teck Wong, 23, of Malaysia; Ronald A. Moy, 23, of Chicago; Kimioko Ajioka, 25, of Japan; and Lai Hung Tam, 23, of Hong Kong. The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms joined the investigation of the fire, which authorities believed from the beginning was the result of arson. Following the fire, thousands of clothing and food items, campus services and cash donations poured in for victims. Thirty-one SIUC students were displaced by the fire. Federal agents helped to investigate the fire. But it remains unsolved. From the Dec. 10, 1992, issue of The Southern: ""Those who were closest to 25-year-old Kimiko Ajioka, a Southern Illinois University at Carbondale student who died in the fire Sunday at The Pyramids apartment complex, say she represented the spirit of a Japanese saying, \'Hakoi-ri-Musume.\' ""The phrase means \'a well-kept treasure.\' ""Kimiko, from Osaka, Japan, was one of five SIUC students killed in the fire early Sunday. Kimiko\'s mother, Reiko, and her four brothers and sisters were together in Southern Illinois Wednesday to make funeral arrangements and to establish a memorial fund in her name. ""Many other families of the international students killed or injured in the fire are making their way to Carbondale this week. The International Student Association is making arrangements for the relatives to stay with families in Carbondale, rather than in hotels. ""When deciding to study in America four years ago, Kimiko knew she would have plenty of support when attending SIUC. Her aunt, Masako Shin, lives in Herrin, and her uncle, Yutaka Toyota, lives in Chicago. Both are SIUC graduates and helped ease her transition from Japan to Carbondale. ""\'In the last two years, she often told me that her four years here had been one of the happiest times of her life,\' said Shin. \'She was a very traditional Japanese young girl. She loved the fresh air of Carbondale, and she was free to think, free to speak, more so than in Japan.\' ""Kimiko was a traditional Japanese dancer, a very intricate and formal type of dance similar to ballet. She had taken three lessons a week for many years as a child to learn the art."" — Brian Mattmiller, The Southern, Dec. 10, 1992 From The Southern, Dec. 11, 1992: ""Arson investigators comb rubble ""Investigators in Carbondale Thursday wrapped up an extensive on-site investigation of the apartment building where fire killed five Southern Illinois University at Carbondale students Sunday. ""Police Chief Don Strom said investigators continue following up leads, but they have no suspects in the arson investigation."" Police said five years after the fire that they believed one person acted alone to set the fatal fire that killed five people, and that the suspect was not living in the Carbondale area then, five years after the incident. Police also said then they did not believe the crime was racially motivated. The investigation at that point had taken police and federal agents to 10 states and Japan, and had involved the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, SIUC and state police, the Illinois State Fire Marshal\'s Office, the federal departments of Justice, State and Treasury, and Interpol. A memorial stands near Campus Lake. The plaque on the memorial reads: ""The world will never know what their young lives could have given. May time ease our grief into passion for making this world more peaceful for all its people."" The Carbondale Police Department currently lists the fire as a cold case. A reward of $6,000 is offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction of those responsible for setting the fire. Firefighters and first responders stand behind Carbondale Mayor John “Mike” Henry as he speaks during a memorial service marking the 25th anniversary of the fire, which killed five SIU students, held on Dec. 6, 2017, at SIU\'s campus lake. Carbondale Police Chief Jeff Grubbs spoke at the memorial, saying his department still has a strong commitment to solving the case. K. Janis Esch wrote in the Dec. 7, 2017, edition of The Southern: “You certainly don’t want to put odds on your ability to successfully resolve an incident, especially one that happened so long ago, but some of the irony associated with that is that there are still several of us that remain at the police department who are in leadership positions that keep that case alive,” Grubbs said. Grubbs was among the three patrol officers who responded to the fire at the time and continue to serve in the police department. “Obviously all the first responders, once we saw the significance of what was occurring that night and those who were desperately trying to escape the smoke and the flames — it’s one of those moments in life that you still have vivid memories of and hope that tragedies like that don’t ever occur again,” Grubbs said. He said people could still be out there, either in the U.S. or in other countries, who have information pertaining to the fire. “Even if they don’t realize the significance of that information, we would simply call upon them to provide (it) to us, to help us get to a point where we can resolve an incident as tragic as this one was,” Grubbs said. SIU and Carbondale community members gathered at Campus Lake in 2017 to mark the 25th anniversary of the fire and remember the victims.

This problem is discussed in a variety of ways in conversations everyday in our communities throughout America.

One such person who addressed this problem is the Honorable Marcus Mosiah Garvey, when he presented his formula for learning in his courses on African Philosophy in the 1930s. I think it is only appropriate to review Mr. Garvey’s formula for learning as we continue to build the Reparations Movement and seek specific guideposts to our development as a people. These lessons and guideposts in learning can be found in Marcus Garvey, Message to the People, The Course of African Philosophy, edited by Dr. Tony Martin. Lesson 1: One must never stop reading. Read everything that you can read, that is of standard knowledge. Don’t waste time reading trashy literature. The idea is that personal experience is not enough for a human to get all the useful knowledge of life, because the individual life is too short, so we must feed on the experience of others. Lesson 2: Read history incessantly until you master it. This means your own national history, the history of the world, social history, industrial history, and the history of the different sciences; but primarily, the history of man. If you do not know what went on before you came here and what is happening at the time you live, but away from you, you will not know the world and will be ignorant of the world and mankind. Lesson 3: To be able to read intelligently, you must first be able to master the language of your country. To do this, you must be well acquainted with its grammar and the science of it. People judge you by your writing and your speech. If you write badly and incorrectly they become prejudiced toward your intelligence, and if you speak badly and incorrectly, those who hear you become disgusted and will not pay much attention to you, but in their hearts laugh after you. Lesson 4: A leader who is to teach men and present any fact of truth to man must first be taught in his subject. Lesson 5: Never write or speak on a subject you know nothing about, for there is always somebody who knows that particular subject to laugh at you or to ask you embarrassing questions that may make others laugh at you. Lesson 6: You should read four hours a day. The best time to read is in the evening after you have retired from your work and after you have rested and before sleeping hours, but do so before morning, so that during your sleeping hours what you read may become subconscious, that is to say, planted in your memory. Lesson 7: Never keep the constant company of anybody who doesn’t know as much as you or (is) as educated as you, and from whom you cannot learn something from or reciprocate your learning. Lesson 8: Continue always in the application of the things you desire educationally, culturally, or otherwise, and never give up until you reach your objective. Lesson 9: Try never to repeat yourself in any one discourse in saying the same thing over and over again except when you are making new points, because repetition is tiresome and it annoys those who hear the repetition. Lesson 10: Knowledge is power. When you know a thing and can hold your ground on that thing and win over your opponents on that thing, those who hear you learn to have confidence in you and will trust your ability. Lesson 11: In reading books written by white authors, of whatever kind, be aware of the fact that they are not written for your particular benefit of your race.

In life, she was the daughter of former slaves and a high school dropout who rose from poverty to extreme wealth as a pioneering hair care magnate. Today, she rests beneath a small, modest iron headstone that bears her epitaph. It also bears the inscription “beauty pioneer.” Buried with Annie Malone is a remarkable achievement that few know about today. For decades, many have learned from history books and documentaries that Madam C.J. Walker was America’s first Black millionaire—a businesswoman who amassed a fortune with her hair grooming empire for Black women. However, today few know that Malone was actually the first self-made female Black millionaire, not Walker, who was a student of Malone’s before she hit it big on her own. Fate brought the two together in St. Louis and their lives would remain linked forever. It was Malone who used the straightening comb to build her fortune before Walker got hold of it and turned it into a moneymaker for herself, too. It would be one of several products that Walker claimed as hers as the two became fierce rivals. With similar backgrounds and ambitions, they blazed a trail for a future generation of hair beauty pioneers. Eventually, Walker’s legacy would grow and overshadow Malone as fame and fortune would take both Black women in two different directions in their lives. With a sprawling estate, luxury cars and a thriving business, Walker died at the height of her wealth and success. Malone did not. Lawsuits, ugly divorces and IRS bills claimed Malone’s groundbreaking empire and tarnished her legacy that she spent an entire life building. Today, Malone’s legacy is largely forgotten while Walker’s success remains the story of record. Along with Johnson Products, Soft Sheen, S.B. Fuller, Murray Cosmetics Company and Johnson Publishing Company’s Fashion Fair, Malone would help establish Chicago as the capital of the Black hair grooming business. She would operate her empire on an entire block of grand mansions on what is now called South King Drive. Where the legendary Black newspaper Chicago Defender and Irvin C. Mollison Elementary School now stand is where the mansions that housed Malone’s Poro College once stood and produced thousands of aspiring beauticians and hair care agents. Malone was born on August 9, 1869 in Metropolis, IL. Located some 366 miles from Chicago, it’s a town that sits on the Ohio River and near the Kentucky state border. Malone was the tenth of 11 children. Like most slaves, her father, Robert Turnbo, joined the Union Army during the Civil War. Malone’s parents died when she was young. Her frequent illnesses forced her to drop out of high school; she turned to hairdressing as her only skill. With her older sister as a surrogate parent, the family moved to Lovejoy, IL. Founded as the nation’s oldest predominantly Black city in 1838, the town of Lovejoy is also known as the place where abolitionist, Elijah Lovejoy, was murdered by a pro-slavery mob in 1837. It was here Malone began learning the science of hair texture differences for people of color. She began experimenting with chemicals and developed her hair care skills before she found her calling as a beauty care specialist. She envisioned a way of straightening hair without using soap, goose fat, heavy oils, butter and bacon grease and other materials that damaged the scalp and caused broken hair follicles. In 1905, the family moved to St. Louis, MO, which then had the nation’s fourth largest Black population. Malone set up a hair care business in Ville, an upwardly mobile area northwest of downtown St. Louis. She hired three Black women as assistants who would go door-to-door selling the products and performing product demonstrations. One of her protégés was Walker, who moved to St. Louis from Delta, LA in 1888 where she was born on a plantation in 1857. Her maiden name then was Sarah Breedlove and she learned about hair grooming from her brothers who were barbers in St. Louis. Walker also suffered with severe dandruff and other scalp ailments caused by the application of harsh products, such as lye. ANNIE MALONE In 1903, Malone married Nelson Pope, but the couple divorced four years later. In 1904, Malone’s reputation exploded as she promoted her “Great Wonderful Hair Grower” product at the St. Louis World’s Fair. In 1906, Breedlove stepped out of her boss’ shadow and moved to Denver where she married Charles Joseph Walker. With a new name, Walker began experimenting with her own hair care products. That year, Malone picked “Poro” as the name of her business and trademarked it. “Poro” is a West African word for “an organization that’s dedicated to discipline and enhancing the body physically.” It fit well with Malone’s belief that Black women would feel better about themselves if they improved their self-image and beauty. Malone established Poro Products for hair care and beauty products as well as the Poro System for her merchandising, distribution and marketing systems. She also built a massive $1 million Poro building in St. Louis that served as the company’s headquarters and meeting place for social and business events. Selling her product through press conferences and advertisements in the Black Press, Malone also conducted demonstrations in the Black churches and Black women’s clubs. In 1914, Malone—then named Annie Turnbo-Pope—married Aaron Eugene Malone, who served as president and chief manager of his wife’s company. In 1918, Malone established the Poro College of Beauty, according to the State Historical Society of Missouri. The school would eventually expand to other cities with a workforce totaling 75,000 women beauty agents. As Malone’s former protégé, Walker moved to Indianapolis in 1910 where she would train some 40,000 “Walker Agents” to grow her business. Walker developed similar products as her rival, but she would also be more business savvy and a marketing guru. Instead of the “Great Wonderful Hair Grower,” Walker would sell the “Madam Walker’s Wonderful Hair Grower.” And whereas Malone took her product’s name from an African word, Walker took it one step further and claimed that ingredients in her hair products were of African origin. Walker also took the straightening comb and made the teeth wider to produce straighter hair. As a result, sales sizzled, according to an article by prominent Black Harvard Prof. Henry Louis Gates, Jr. The article also stated Walker added “Madam” in front of her name because it had a French cache while “defying many white people’s tendency to refer to Black women by their first names, or worse, as ‘Auntie.’” In addition to hair care products, Walker sold customers a lifestyle that included a concept of total hygiene and beauty. And while graduates of Malone’s Poro College of Beauty received certificates, graduates of Walker’s “Leila College” received diplomas. By 1913, Madam Walker had offices and beauty culture schools in Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Brooklyn and New York.. Eight years after Walker’s death in 1919, her daughter, A’Lelia Walker, completed the construction of a four-story Walker Theatre Company building, similar in looks to Malone’s Poro building in St. Louis. Both Malone and Walker were generous philanthropists. Malone donated $25,000—then the largest private donation—to Howard University’s Medical School and $25,000 to start a YMCA in a Black neighborhood in St. Louis. Walker contributed $1,000 to build the first Black YMCA in Indianapolis. As far as wealth, Malone was earning and spending millions years before Walker’s empire got off the ground. By the 1920s, Malone’s wealth was estimated at $14 million ($200 million today when adjusted for inflation). The Philadelphia Tribune reported that Malone paid some $40,000 in taxes in the mid-1920s. A highly publicized, six-year legal battle ended in a nasty divorce. Malone’s husband, who argued he helped the business grow by his contacts, received $200,000 in 1927. Three years later, Malone moved her empire to Chicago, where she bought four mansions that occupied an entire city block on South Parkway. Known as the “Poro Block,” Malone’s mansion at 4411 South Parkway (today it is King Drive) was once owned by John R. Thompson, a prominent businessman who did not allow Blacks to eat in his restaurants. According to an article in the Chicago Defender, Malone’s arrival in Chicago was met with a lavish reception attended by Defender founder Robert S. Abbott. From various reports, Pilgrim Baptist Church music director Thomas Dorsey wrote his famous hymn, “Precious Lord, Take My Hand,” while sitting at a piano inside a mansion on the Poro College Campus in 1932 following the death of both his wife and infant. Despite its warm reception in Chicago, Malone’s business never achieved the level of success it had when it was headquartered in St. Louis. While she traveled to expand her empire, she left the day-to-day affairs to unscrupulous managers who were either inexperienced or dishonest. She was the target of several lawsuits, including one by an employee who sued her after claiming credit to Malone’s'}]"

Christopher Span, UI Professor of Education Policy, Organization and Leadership Our nation is at the crossroads. We face a crisis in national leadership, a viral pandemic that has led to a health and economic catastrophe unparalleled in the nation’s history, and uncurtailed, unrelenting racial injustice. In less than three months, more than 100,000 people have lost their lives to COVID-19, more than 40 million Americans are unemployed, and everyone feels unsettled. The lives lost to this pandemic are unequal. They disproportionately consist of the most vulnerable in our nation — family members with compromised immune systems, our elders in nursing homes, and African American, Latinx and Indigenous citizens forced to reside and work in high-density, impoverished, segregated spaces. On top of all this uncertainty and disruption, and for nearly two weeks now, we have watched people take to the streets and march in protest because of the senseless death of Minneapolis citizen George Floyd, who died from asphyxiation because of the sustained compressed pressure police officers placed on his neck and back for nearly nine minutes. Mr. Floyd died on May 25th, apparently over a dispute regarding the legitimacy of a $20 bill. He wasn’t the first African American to be harassed, targeted or die over something so trivial. The list of trivial affronts toward African Americans, unfortunately, is unending in the history of America. A false allegation, supposedly whistling at a White woman, reckless eyeballing Whites, a toy gun, a cigarette, a soda pop, a lemonade stand, a barbeque grill, a traffic light, no turn signal, a broken taillight, speeding, jogging, bird watching, walking home, talking back, loud music, congregating on a street corner, a hoodie, a mask. All should be seen as maddeningly senseless reasons to target and kill people, but for far too long and for far too many people in our nation — as demonstrated through prolonged silence or public sanctioning — these everyday considerations are seemingly normal and acceptable reasons for Black people to be harassed and killed. Had there not been a courageous teenager willing to share the entirety of the incident she recorded with her cell phone, it is almost certain none of the four officers would have lost their jobs, or been arrested and charged for the death of Mr. Floyd. In fact, the day after Mr. Floyd’s murder, a police statement was released describing him as a “suspected forger” who “appeared to be under the influence” who “physically resisted officers,"" and who appeared to be “suffering medical distress."" Aside from repeatedly declaring that he could not breathe to the officers assaulting him — perhaps this is what the statement meant by “suffering medical distress” — the rest of the police statement was a complete misrepresentation of what happened when the video footage was released, and the general public viewed it with horrification. The statement seems to be an intentionally fabricated lie. Notwithstanding, much of America — before the video and subsequent protests — was ready to willingly accept it as unquestionable truth. The police statement sharply contrasts the accounts of the bystanders heard on the video who witnessed Mr. Floyd’s senseless death; it omitted their pleas for the officers to ease or end the assault on Mr. Floyd; it failed to mention their shouts of “he can’t breathe” or “you’re killing him”; it intentionally left out the collective discretionary actions these officers undertook as they violently assaulted Mr. Floyd to the point of unconsciousness and death. The testimonials, recounting, presence, frustrations, pains, angst and pleas of Mr. Floyd’s community and people were ignored, never asked for, or silenced. They went unheard. They weren’t present in the police statement justifying the violent death of Mr. Floyd; a statement incontestably accepted as factual by state and local authorities, and a general public believing George Floyd must have done something wrong and the police were simply there to arrest Floyd to make a bad situation right. After all, weren’t the police called to apprehend a potential forger? Bystanders witnessing Floyd’s murder knew better, but still they went unheard. It wasn’t until days later, after the 10-minute video of this teenage bystander was released, and people started protesting because of what they saw in this video, that all the officers were fired, and the officer who knelt on Mr. Floyd’s neck and killed him, was charged and arrested for third-degree manslaughter. Only days ago were all the offending officers charged with second-degree manslaughter, but many in the nation don’t believe they will be convicted. Rarely are police convicted of assault and murder. As mass organization and protests continue in every state of the Union, many wonder if the officers culpable in the death of Mr. Floyd will ever be truly held accountable for their actions and blatant abuse of power and public trust. The videoing of the tortured death of Mr. Floyd, to me, stands apart from previous recordings capturing the senseless death of African Americans at the hands of the police, or from someone White deputizing themselves as the police of Black people. The knee on the neck of this Black man metaphorically defined America’s domineering oppressive history and relationship with Black people. It compressed and captured 400-plus years of unacknowledged history, and triggered stressors of the unadulterated anxiety, trauma, pain, even powerlessness, of what life is like as a Black person in America. The video thrust forward one of this nation’s most uncomfortable longstanding unacknowledged and painful truths. The truth that regardless of circumstance or persona, Black life does not matter, not equally at least, in America. The truth that America has had an extremely difficult time fully accepting and treating African Americans as equals in society. Not amid five decades of “freedom” for Black people following 35 decades of slavery and segregation by law. Not amid countless videos and photographs capturing the violent history Black people have had with White supremacy, slavery, segregation (by law and cultural practice), mass incarceration, systemic racism and the police. Not amid electing and reelecting this nation’s first Black President. Not even amid a viral contagion disproportionately impacting and killing African Americans, and denying them a chance to grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones together as family. The video reminded everyday Americans — regardless of background — of how uncompassionate this nation can be when a people are stamped as property (or less than), or a deficit, or a problem from the very day they arrived or were born in this country. Protests to the murder of George Floyd reveal everyday people’s frustrations to this reality. They know America can be better, and African Americans deserve better. The protesters come from generations of Americans who have given their all to progressing this nation; whose parents and grandparents fought in wars to preserve democracy. The protestors are people who still show up to work despite the risks this viral pandemic plaguing humanity poses to their health and safety. They’re people historically forced to accept racism and denial as everyday facts of life. They are people who care about the well-being of others when the same is not afforded to them and theirs. They live in communities under-resourced, undernourished, under-educated, underemployed, under siege, underfunded, under surveillance and under the knee of generations of policies and expectations that cared more about preserving slavery and segregation than promoting freedom and equality. They are people who, as children, learned with pride to recite the words of the Preamble of the Constitution in their elementary classrooms, but who, as adults, don’t feel like these words apply or belong to them.

Simultaneously known as 16-Inch or Slow Pitch, Softball is serious business and the most intense and competitive extracurricular sport in Chicago. Softball began here in 1887 but didn\'t become the no-glove 16-inch variety until the 1920\'s. The bigger and softer balls (giggle) became popular during the Great Depression because players weren\'t required to afford a glove. Almost every summer night you can find a game or join a league along the lake. Local hospitals are also able to easily tell when slow pitch season has started due to the significant rise in emergency room walk-ins with jammed or broken fingers. Broken fingers which are worn like a badge of honor. 20 Minutes Forget traffic or any other potential complications, 20 minutes is the estimated travel time to get anywhere in Chicago.

Alderman/Alderwoman (Chicago) - aka The Little Mayors - aka The Vassals (as part of the greater Chicago Democratic Party Feudal System). Aldermen/women are elected by popular vote every four years, on the last Tuesday in February. In the event that no candidate garners more than fifty percent of the vote, a run-off election is held on the first Tuesday in April. New terms begin at noon on the third Monday in May following the election. Chicago elects 50 Aldermen/women from 50 wards, an extraordinary number as compared to most major American cities. For example, New York City has over three times Chicago\'s population but elects a similar number of 51 alderpersons. Los Angeles and Philadelphia each elect 15 alderpersons, comparatively. A Chicago Alderman/Alderwoman has, historically, been one of the most unique city government political positions in the entire United States. In addition to its publicly outlined legislative duties (more can be found under ""City Council""), Chicago\'s aldermen/women are generally given exceptional deference, called ""aldermanic privilege"" or ""aldermanic prerogative"", to control city decisions and services within their ward. This is an unwritten and informal practice that emerged in the early 20th century and gives aldermen/women control over zoning, licenses, permits, property-tax reductions, city contracts, and patronage jobs in their wards. It is often based on ""understandings"" among members or on ""arrangements"" with city administrators who find it expedient to routinely comply with aldermanic requests. Using common sense, this obviously leads to corruption through the institution, and the Chicago City Council and its elected Aldermen/women are among the nation\'s most notoriously corrupt. In fact, the City Council has often been described as the epicenter of political corruption in town. For example, between 1973 and 2012, there were 100 different sitting members of the Council. Of that group of 100, there were 31 members convicted for official corruption, proving a conviction rate of nearly one-third. To reiterate, that\'s just those officially convicted. For larger example, an investigation after the 2013 election found that over half of Chicago Aldermen/women took illegal campaign contributions. Bags - aka Cornhole. Outside of Chicagoland, you\'re likely to know the game as ""Cornhole."" The game where you throw bean bags onto boards of wood with a hole in the middle from however many paces you and your friends decide while day drinking. Here in Chicagoland, it\'s rare to find it called ""Cornhole"" and you\'ll almost certainly hear it called ""Bags."" Bang! Bang! International travelers are well aware that Chicago\'s reputation as an old gang town precedes them. ""Bang Bang"" is a nickname for Chicago heard in many places around the globe. For example: ""Where are you from?"" ""Chicago."" ""Oh...Bang! Bang!"" Followed by a smile and finger guns. Bean, The - aka Cloud Gate Like the artist who created the sculpture, we initially hated ""The Bean"" as a nickname. It\'s not that the sculpture\'s actual name, ""Cloud Gate,"" was any better (it\'s not). In all honesty, at first we didn\'t really like the sculpture at all. However, as with all things, time has a way of altering initial perspectives. And, like the Picasso in Daley Plaza, ""The Bean"" has grown on us and we now see it as kind of charming, in its own way. If anything, it makes for an easy landmark to meet a friend in Millenium Park. Blagojevich - aka Rod Blagojevich, aka Governor Blagojevich, aka Blago. Perhaps the most media hungry and attention seeking politician in Chicago and Illinois history. Trust us, that is really saying something. Rod Blagojevich was found guilty of public corruption after he attempted to solicit bribes to occupy the U.S. Senate seat vacated by then President-Elect Barack Obama. He was impeached by the Illinois legislature in 2009, later convicted, and ultimately sentenced to 14 years in federal prison. Despite his conviction, rather than be known as a criminal or political mastermind, he is largely remembered by locals as some combination of an overeager beaver and bumbling buffoon who was a product of the Chicago political machine and just practicing business as usual per the Chicago political machine\'s modus operandi. After his pardon, his wife Patti\'s reputation solidified as positive. She stood by her man during his stint in the slammer and worked hard to get him released. For obvious reasons, such loyalty is a highly respected quality in Chicago. Billy Goat Tavern - aka Billy Goat The Billy Goat Tavern is a chain of taverns located in Chicago. It achieved fame primarily through newspaper columns by Mike Royko, a supposed curse on the Chicago Cubs, and the Olympia Cafe sketch on Saturday Night Live. Being situated between the offices of the Chicago Tribune and the old Chicago Sun-Times building led to the tavern\'s mention in several regular newspaper columns and was a regular hangout for city reporters. The address is 430 N. Michigan Ave. on the Lower Level. Near the Tribune Tower and Wrigley Building, go to the west side of Michigan Ave. Look for a sign and walk down the stairs and it\'ll be there. Bishop Ford (Freeway) - aka Interstate (I) 94, aka Illinois Route 394, aka Calumet Expressway. Part of I-94 and separately Illinois Route 394 is the Bishop Ford Freeway. It starts at the southern terminus of the Dan Ryan Expressway and heads first southeast and then south through southern Chicago and into Chicago\'s southern suburbs, where it intersects with the western end of the Kingery Expressway and the eastern end of the Tri-State Tollway, then continues on further into the south suburbs before downgrading to a surface highway and eventually terminating into Dixie Highway (Illinois Route 1) south of Crete, Illinois. The portion of the Bishop Ford Freeway north of the interchange with the Kingery Expressway is signed as Interstate 94; south of that point it is signed as Illinois Route 394. Blue Line (CTA) - aka West-Northwest Line, aka O\'Hare Route The Blue Line is physically the longest ""L"" route in the city but the 2nd busiest by weekday passengers. Like the Red Line, it contains 33 stations. If coming/going to O\'Hare airport, the Blue Line is the line you need to take. The Blue Line runs 24/7/365. Blues (Chicago Style) The recipe for Chicago Blues is as follows: grab a guitar and sing as Charlotte Forten told you to sing, ""with a full heart and troubled spirit."" Best practices add a harp (harmonica). Technically, that\'s all you really need. After that, drums and bass are always welcome. A piano is similarly not required but a welcome addition. You can find a Blues club in almost every Chicago neighborhood. Blues Brothers, (The) Arguably the greatest Chicago movie of all time. We would argue it is the greatest Chicago movie of all time but the John Hughes film fans are a strange bunch and we don\'t really want to deal with the backlash from them right now. Boss For as long as anyone can remember, the term ""Boss"" has referred to the true political power, the unofficial King(s) of Chicago which, due to its sheer size and domineering attitude toward'}]"

8 retail storefronts and 70% of 84 residential units occupied. More than two-thirds of the residences will be set aside below the market rate. Developed by Brinshore Development and the Michaels Organization, 4400 Grove broke ground in February 2019, backed by $38 million in public funds from the city and the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA), including $7.2 million in Tax Increment Financing (TIF) and $1.9 million in low-income housing tax credits. But the planning extended back years before that. ""A month after I started my job as alderman of the 4th Ward, I met with the development team, I met with the hardworking group regarding this future project. That was four and a half years ago,"" said Sophia King, acknowledging former Ald. Shirley Newsome (4th), CHA Central Advisory Council President Francine Washington and Washington Park Local Advisory Council Vice President Betty Thompson. The community room at 4400 Grove ""It was a project that had long been gestating in the community, for almost 15 years, and it would be the first project where my influence would play a role. It would signal community values for housing and community development for years to come. An apartment dining room at 4400 Grove ""I\'m a firm believer that equity should be at the forefront of everything that we do, and that we should be bold in our efforts to change our community for the better, but it has the be deliberate,"" she continued. She said that 4400 Grove ""was completed with more than 61% minority participation"" and that 36% of contractors were African American. ""It just showed that we can do this,"" King said. ""That fallacy that there\'s nobody out there, that we can\'t find anybody is just false, and we cannot continue to believe in it."" CHA CEO Tracey Scott noted that all of 4400 Grove\'s mixed-income residents will be able to enjoy the building\'s amenities: a community room, a fitness center, a business center and a landscaped outdoor space behind it. ""Further, at a time when businesses are shutting down amid a global pandemic, this project is providing the opportunity for new and minority-owned local businesses,"" she added. Mayor Lori Lightfoot, for her part, observed that all business tenants at 4400 Grove are people of color. The lobby at 4400 Grove ""This is exactly the kind of economic empowerment our city needs, must focus on and create more of, and one that\'s amplified through our INVEST South/West initiative, which brings together public and private sector partners on our South and West sides that have been neglected for far too long,"" she said. ""Because 4400 Grove is on this corridor for INVEST South/West, it will benefit from our ongoing work to revive Cottage Grove and serve as an anchor development for the entire street, making this development critical to the continued investment in Bronzeville."" Ald. Sophia King (4th), fifth from right, poses with business tenants at 4400 Grove. ""We brought eight business owners who are community-based to a project that nobody thought could happen, and they definitely didn\'t think it could happen in twelve months,"" said Executive Director Rhonda McFarland of the Quad Communities Development Corporation, the local business improvement district. ""This is what you did when you work with our on-the-ground business partners."" Reached for comment after the opening, Thompson with the Washington Park Local Advisory Council said her years-long involvement with the planning came directly from her two decades of living in a similar development — CHA\'s Lake Parc Place, 3983 S. Lake Park Ave. — and seeing it become ""a traditional public housing development."" ""I would not like to see that happen with (Woodlawn) Station nor Shops & Lofts at 47, and I\'m afraid that that\'s what\'s going to happen because of the politics in this city,"" she said. She observed a shortage of affordable and low-income housing in Chicago and said Lake Parc Place, built in 1963 as the Lake Michigan high-rises, had been an attempted model mixed-income community around the turn of the millennium. But she said maintenance quality has declined today. ""The services are different because the income levels have changed,"" she said, with market-rate renters leaving because of a decline in quality. Nevertheless, Thompson has hopes that 4400 Grove and the other new mixed-income developments will be better maintained because the city is advertising its investment into the properties. But she also hopes that the developments will become home to settled communities. ""As long as they keep the property maintained and the rules maintained, that building is going to be great,"" she said. ""It\'s going wonderful."" a.gettinger@hpherald.com Reporter Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language. PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR CAPS LOCK.

Неговата дъщеря Камил съобщи, че той е починал в събота вечер, като добави, че подробностите за погребението в прочутото парижко гробище Пер Лашез ще бъдат съобщени по-късно. Марсо, чието истинско име е Марсел Манжел, стана световноизвестен с образа на Бип, създаден през 1947 като тъжен клоун с тебеширено бяло лице, раирано сако и смачкана шапка. Марсо се слави с това, че собственоръчно е съживил пантомимата след края на Втората световна война, след като в продължение на две десетилетия то беше засенчвано от нямото кино. Марсо беше вдъхновен да стане мим от велики американски артисти на нямото кино като Чарли Чаплин, Бъстър Китън и Хари Лангдън. Неговата трупа Compagnie Marcel Marceau беше единствената група за пантомима в света през 50-те и 60-те години и се радваше на голяма популярност в цял свят. От 1969 до 1971 той ръководеше училището за пантомима във Франция – Ecole Internationale de Mime, преди да създаде своята Ecole Internationale de Mimodrame в Париж през 1978 година. Той участва и в няколко филма. През 2001 той беше избран за посланик на добра воля на ООН за възрастните хора.'}]"

After discussing possible cannabis businesses for more than a month, the Mount Carroll City Council approved two ordinances at its Thursday, Dec. 19, meeting. The first ordinance essentially ""opts in"" the city to allowing cannabis-related businesses. It does establish that such businesses must not be within 300 feet of any pre-existing public or private nursery schools; preschools; primary or secondary schools; day care center; day care homes or residential care homes; property zoned or used for residential purposes. This distance was originally 1,500 feet in the draft presented at the Dec. 10 meeting. However, Mayor Carl Bates, City Attorney Ron Coplan and council members agreed that in a smaller community, this distance could prevent any development. The council also adopted an ordinance establishing 3 percent Cannabis Retailer\'s Occupation Tax. Both of the ordinances were approved unanimously, with no additional discussion. At this point, the city has not set any zoning on which types of cannabis-related businesses will be allowed in specific areas in the city. Earlier Thursday, Dec. 19, the Carroll County Board discussed potential zoning for these types of businesses. Zoning Administrator Jeremy Hughes presented a report to the board from the Dec. 2 Zoning Board of Appeals meeting where a possible ordinance for cannabis-related businesses was discussed. Hughes said three options were examined at that meeting: regulate all categories of this type of businesses by special use permit; regulate them by a conditional license, similar to a liquor license; opt out and prohibit cannabis-related businesses in the unincorporated areas of the county. Hughes said the ZBA recommended option one, utilizing special use permits, with the possibility of prohibiting locations of onsite consumption or retail. ""It certainly gives you a lot more options and a lot more involvement makes it into the public,"" said Hughes, about using special use permits for the businesses. Hughes added that the special use permit process slows things down, giving people a chance to comment during public meetings on the potential business. He said the board could establish setback (approved distances) from churches, schools, parks and other such locations. He emphasized that any restrictions designated as part of the special use permit would need to be followed by the businesses. The board agreed that the special use permit format would be the best for cannabis-related businesses in unincorporated portions of the county. Hughes said they have no way of knowing if anyone will want to place such a business in these portions of the county. ""Who knows, that\'s why we\'re here,"" Hughes said. The ZBA will continue discussion on the matter at its next meeting on Jan. 6, with the hope of approving a draft ordinance to present to the county board next month. The county board also briefly discussed the creation of a zero-tolerance policy for county employees related to cannabis. The county currently has a policy prohibiting the use of alcohol at work. ""I think the cannabis is going to be a little more tricky,"" County Administrator Mike Doty said. He explained that marijuana can ""linger"" in a person\'s system for a month or so, noting most drug tests are not sensitive enough to exactly pinpoint when cannabis was consumed. Doty said the county has already been told by its insurance carrier that they will not be able to drug test for marijuana for pre-employment as part of the interview process anymore.

The stories and myths of Charlie Birger live on almost a century after his death. Birger’s myth looms large in Southern Illinois where nearly 100 years ago he and his men brought horrific violence to Franklin and Williamson counties, filling many graves in the process. Birger was born in about 1880 in Russia and came to the U.S. at the age of 8 with his family — they settled near the St. Louis area. He was a lot of things in his life — immigrant turned soldier, turned cowboy, turned coal miner, turned gangster. Bill Owens, a board member for the Franklin County Historic Preservation Society, said it was likely the allure of the booming coal industry that brought one of the region\'s biggest characters to Southern Illinois. A fence at the rear of the old Franklin County Jail pictured in 2006 surrounds a replica of the gallows built on the exact spot, according to the jail museum, where bootlegging gangster Charlie Birger was hanged April 19, 1928. Owens said he has heard a lot of stories about how Birger got his foot in the door with bootlegging alcohol — he said folklore can get in the way of facts sometimes. But, he felt confident in one thing: Charlie Birger likely didn’t come to power peacefully. Owens said Birger “strong-armed” his way into the booming business. Carl Shelton Owens said that, eventually, Birger’s gang butt heads with the other local bootlegging outfit run by Carl Shelton. According to previous reporting by The Southern, the beef centered around distribution and disputes over turf. Tommy guns rang out from the inside of armored trucks and Owens said even the first aerial bombing recorded in the U.S. was between the Birger and Shelton Gangs — the Sheltons were trying to destroy Birger\'s hideout, the Shady Rest food stand on Route 13 between Marion and Harrisburg.

The bombing destroyed his porch, but didn’t kill Adams. A month later, Birger sent two hit men to finish the job. And, two years later, Birger was at the gallows. The gallows that were used in the hanging of notorious ganster, Charlie Birger, in 1928 are on display at the Franklin County Historic Jail Museum in Benton. ""The judge just wouldn’t buy it,” Owens said. Owens said Birger had been arrested many times before and said he believes Birger thought the case would be thrown out. Perhaps the most famous element of Birger’s story is that of his death. Statistics aside about his being the last public hanging in the state — incidentally, Owens said the gallows used for Birger’s death was also used in the last public hanging in the U.S. in 1936 — his last words have become famous on their own. A replica of the noose used to hang Birger. Owens said there is some debate over whether this or the variant “It\'s a beautiful day” were Birger’s last, but he feels confident in the former. The words read like poetry and Owens said he thinks there is a sense of regret in them. He said the day of the hanging was sunny, and in mid-April the world was in bloom. “I’m losing what’s really important. It’s a beautiful world and I’ve thrown it all away,” Owens said of what he imagines was going through Birger’s mind just before the end. Then again, Owens admits he was also high on morphine — though Owens said he suspects this was a habit he had established before his conviction, so the dose he got before being walked out to his death may have been commonplace for him. Volunteering at the museum, Owens said he hears all kinds of stories from visitors about their family connection to the Birger story. Keeping that history alive means keeping part of their family history alive, too. Charlie Birger stood in this spot inside the Franklin County Jail the night before his hanging and allowed St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Roy Alexander to interview him and take this picture. Birger said Alexander was one of the only people he trusted to tell his story acurately. ""Everybody feels connected,” Owens said. “It brings Birger back to life for them.” According to the news report, 500 people were present to watch Birger\'s hanging. ""Erect and nonchalant, almost debonair, Birger walked to his death,"" the story reads. ""The procession emerged from the jail at 9:50 a.m., headed by Sheriff James Pritchard ... (Birger) moved at an easy pace, stopping to shake hands with several persons on the way through the stockade to the gallows a distance of 100 feet. The condemned man mounted the steps. Smiling, he pointed a finger at some man in the crowd and waved his hand ... Birger nodded and closed his eyes an instant. Quickly the black cap was slipped over his head ... True to the code of gangland, Birger died without \'squealing.\' \'Beautiful world,\' he said which standing on the scaffold. \'I\'ve forgiven everybody.\'"" Get up-to-the-minute news sent straight to your device.'}]"

On a shoestring he put on dozens of plays and musicals andtrained hundreds of young teen aspiring actors, singers, dancers. More importantly, he encouraged us to discover and express all aspects of ourselves, with a firm and critical guidance motivated by generosity, humor and kindness that touched us all – I didn’t know a single kid who didn;t have respect and love for Tom. Theater was so important esp for kids who were troubled ignored abused or just confused, and Tom helped so many. It was a long time ago and a different piece of my life but I can see on social media how many of my friends then mourn and miss him now. I’m sure his friends at SIU will appreciate hearing this. Nicholas Holt • Dec 21, 2020 at 1:45 pm Tom Kidd was also the director of Athens Creative Theater in Athens Georgia from the mid-1970’s through the early 80’s. Tom inspired so many of us to the beauty and power of creativity. As Athens grew into the art town that produced REM and the B52s, many of us local kids brought what Tom Kidd gave us to the growing Athens Art scene. His contribution will never be forgotten. He was exceptional. Sincerely, Dr. Nicholas A. Holt Margaret Holt • Dec 21, 2020 at 12:42 pm In the late 70s Tom Kidd was the director of Athens Creative Theatre, Athens, Georgia. My son had the benefit as a very young child to be part of the young thespians. I will say and my son would say that he was a “marker” person in his life and development. I will always be grateful to the way he worked with children in our community. I am deeply saddened to know of his passing. In 1979 he was the director in December of “The Best Christmas Pageant Ever.” I will never forget these productions.

When intruders targeted Dan and Barbara Donovan’s Niles home earlier this month, they picked the wrong couple to burglarize.Instead of fleeing the modest brick house with valuables, the three men ran in fear as Dan, 81, chased them out the door with an antique shillelagh, a wooden Irish walking stick that once belonged to his grandfather.“I hit the one guy on the back of his head,” Donovan, a former Marine, recalled. “I’m certain he had a headache.”It was late afternoon on Nov. 4 when the couple, 50-year residents of Niles, heard a knock at their door and found a man wearing a reflective vest and a face mask standing outside. The visitor, who was carrying what appeared to be tools, said he was there to check their “fuse box” due a recent fire in the area.Barbara Donovan said the visit did not immediately seem unusual.“We had received a letter from the electric company the day before,” Donovan said, explaining that the letter indicated work would be taking place in their area and would include power outages. “So when he said he was with the electric company, we let him in.”What the couple didn’t immediately realize was that the man wasn’t a utility worker — and he wasn’t alone. As he led the couple into the basement of their home, two additional people sneaked inside through the now unlocked door.Downstairs, Barbara Donovan began to feel suspicious about the man who was looking over her electric circuit panel. “I kept backing up and he kept saying, ‘Come over by me,'” Barbara said. “He said, ‘If you’re home alone, you won’t know what to do,’ and kept telling me to come closer to him. I thought that was kind of weird.” Dan Donovan holds the shillelagh, an Irish walking stick, that he used to chase intruders from his Niles home on Nov. 4.Suddenly, Barbara heard the squeak of floorboards above her head.“I yelled, ‘Danny! Somebody’s in our bedroom!” she said.Barbara bounded up the steps, followed by her husband and the so-called utility worker. When they reached the main floor, the Donovans discovered there were more than just the three of them inside.“I started chasing them to get them out of my house,” Dan Donovan said.That’s when he grabbed his grandfather’s shillelagh, which was propped up in the corner of the couple’s dining room.“I was trying to find some type of persuasive weapon,” Donovan said. “So I picked up the Irish shillelagh and that turned out to be the equalizer because I managed to chase them out of the house.”One of the men was carrying what Donovan recognized to be a pillowcase from bedroom. Shouting and swinging the shillelagh, Dan Donovan said he struck the man in the back of the head with the end of the walking stick, but he didn’t drop the pillowcase. He followed his partners in crime outside, but Donovan continued his pursuit. Barefoot, he approached the SUV they had parked in his driveway and began hitting it with the walking stick.“I managed to get a good swing at the windshield and the rear window,” he said. “I think I cracked them both.”In the meantime, Barbara Donovan said she was on the phone to police, who arrived shortly after the intruders fled the scene.In all the excitement, and due to the darkening skies, Donovan acknowledged he was unable to get the license plate number or the make and model of the SUV.Niles police, in their report of the incident, categorized what happened to the Donovans as a “ruse entry,” a common scam in which thieves, posing as utility workers, landscapers, other types of workers or neighbors, approach a home and lure the residents outside or into another part of the house while their partners sneak in and search for jewelry, cash and other small valuables.The Donovans say they still aren’t quite sure what, if anything, the burglars stole, but they do know their pillowcase was taken and their bedroom drawers had been removed and rummaged through.“They just scared the heck out of us,” Barbara said.The couple acknowledged they feel somewhat chagrined that they didn’t catch on right away that they were victims of a scammer. Even their children, they say, ask them why they let the first man inside. Barbara points to the letter they received the day earlier from ComEd, though she now wonders if that, too, was part of the scam.For his part, Dan Donovan praises his wife for quickly catching on to what the scammers were up to. The incident has taught him to be more alert, he said, and he urges others to do the same.And while he doesn’t consider himself a hero, Barbara does.“I felt a lot better when I saw him with the shillelagh because he was chasing them out of the house,” she said.“Hopefully they got nothing more than a headache and hopefully they pursue another occupation,” Dan Donovan said.jjohnson@chicagotribune.comTwitter: @Jen_Tribune Instead of fleeing the modest brick house with valuables, the three men ran in fear as Dan, 81, chased them out the door with an antique shillelagh, a wooden Irish walking stick that once belonged to his grandfather. “I hit the one guy on the back of his head,” Donovan, a former Marine, recalled. “I’m certain he had a headache.” It was late afternoon on Nov. 4 when the couple, 50-year residents of Niles, heard a knock at their door and found a man wearing a reflective vest and a face mask standing outside.

Low 54F. Winds light and variable.. Cloudy skies this evening will become partly cloudy after midnight. Low 54F. Winds light and variable. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 7:40 pm By SAMANTHA PIDDE As all Illinois public schools remain closed during April due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students and teachers continue to practice remote learning techniques from home. The West Carroll School Board formally approved the district\'s E-learning and remote learning plan at its March 31 meeting. The district used three days for remote planning for staff to prepare for the new learning format and to allow students and families to pick up materials, if needed. Students will receive either a pass or incomplete for grading purposes. West Carroll Supt. Julie Katzenberger said that while teachers will mostly conduct remote learning days online, families with students in grades 3-12 without internet access have been able to pick up learning packets from the district at designated times. Otherwise, all assignments are found on the district\'s website under teacher pages. All students in grades pre-kindergarten through second grade needed to pick up materials. Katzenberger said the pick-up times were staggered over three days by grade level to minimize potential COVID-19 exposure. Chromebooks were available to some grade levels as well. The first Remote Learning Day was Friday, April 3, and ""West Carroll staff is doing a great job adapting to remote learning,"" Katzenberger said. Jess Ervin of Savanna, mother of two West Carroll Primary School students, said in an email Friday, Aug. 10, that things are going well after a full week of E-learning. “The kids really enjoyed seeing each other,” she said. Miss Yingling asked what they had been doing and told them if they have any questions about any of the E-learning assignments to email her and she will help them through anything. “Aside from their Google classroom assignments, all teachers have made sure all students have their passwords for all learning websites that they use daily in the classroom and we are able to go to those websites, login and continue with the program while the teachers can track their continued progress. We get emails from teachers that suggest sites for all subjects, experiments, and outdoor activities.” Added Ervin, “All teachers are quick to respond with any help and also have been keeping in touch to keep moral up! I am very happy with the way WC Primary is handling our transition to this new normal for our kids. “Ms. Rein, the principal, has started recording the morning announcements and posting them on the WC Primary Facebook page daily. It helps the kids get in the school routine and assures them that the entire staff is thinking about them every day as they would if they were sitting in a classroom, walking the halls, in the cafeteria or on the playground.” Gov. Pritzker\'s order also suspends state assessments for spring 2020, including the Constitution exam. This action also officially ended assessment activity statewide for the Illinois Assessment of Readiness, Illinois Science Assessment, SAT, and Dynamic Learning Maps-Alternate Assessment for the 2019-20 school year. ""Illinois recognizes that the free SAT provided by the state is the only opportunity many students get to take a college entrance exam,” said Katzenberger. “Illinois State Board of Education is working with the College Board on developing options to allow current 11th grade students to take the SAT in the fall.” The county’s other two school districts are utilizing similar remote learning methods. In Chadwick-Milledgeville, kindergarten-fifth grade students are logging into Class Dojo and other learning sites to complete assignments. Older students are recording their attendance through the district\'s Teacherease website and utilizing a variety of learning platforms for instruction. Computers have been provided to K-5 students without home computers. ""Parents, we appreciate your support and encouragement of your students during Instructional Remote Learning Days,"" Milledgeville Supt. Tim Schurman said in an email to parents. ""We also encourage parents to discuss your expectations with your children regarding the importance of doing the work."" Eastland School District also is utilizing similar E-learning plans. ""During this time, on-site learning will remain suspended but our schools\' commitment to learning and education will remain open and learning will continue for all students - just through a different format,"" Supt. Alex Kasher posted on the district\'s Facebook page. School districts also are providing free meals (breakfast and lunch) for students who need them. Katzenberger said that between March 17-30, 838 ""Grab and Go"" meals were served at sites in each of the three towns. From March 23-27, the district\'s transportation department delivered 1,186 meals. ""Staff are doing an amazing job preparing and delivering meals to students in the West Carroll schools,"" said Katzenberger. ""We miss our students and hope that everyone is staying home and staying safe."" West Carroll continues to offer its ""Grab and Go"" meals at the WCPS, district office and the bus barn in Thomson between 8-9:30 a.m. Both breakfast and lunch can be picked up at those times. Families unable to make it to those locations can contact the district for delivery. Delivery is from 8 a.m.-noon Monday through Friday. The Chadwick-Milledgeville district is conducting a sack lunch delivery program Monday through Friday. People may call 815-225-7141 each day by 9:30 a.m. to request lunches for their students. Lunches will include a sandwich, vegetable, fruit, and snack. There is no cost for these lunches, for students 18 and under, currently enrolled in the district and sack lunches will be delivered to homes by C.U.S.D #399 employees around noon each day. Eastland is offering meals for every school day, but is only holding pick up of their grab-and-go meals twice a week. More than one meal will be distributed at a time. Meals can be picked up at either school building from 11:30 a.m.-1 p.m. Monday and Wednesday.

The St. Louis Regional Chamber, AllianceSTL, Civic Progress, Downtown STL, Inc. and Arch to Park will combine their strengths into one organization known as Greater St. Louis, Inc. The group’s growth agenda will focus on creating jobs, expanding equity and improving St. Louis’ global competitiveness. The Metro East will place a crucial role moving forward, representatives of the effort told the Illinois Business Journal. “For the past several months, our organizations have been working closely together in the same building with most of us on the same floor, and that strengthened the spirit of collaboration among our teams,” says Tom Chulick, current president and CEO of the St. Louis Regional Chamber, who previously announced his retirement at the end of the year. “The leadership of our organizations began exploring the benefits of making that collaboration permanent through an integration.” The design of Greater St. Louis, Inc. is adapted from other best-in-class regions, some larger and smaller than St. Louis, including Charlotte, Denver, Des Moines, Indianapolis and Pittsburgh. Under this new model, effective Jan. 1, 2021, Greater St. Louis, Inc. will serve the 15-county St. Louis metropolitan region as a unified flagship organization with a bold strategy and agenda. Under Greater St. Louis, Inc., four affiliates will execute highly focused strategic functions: AllianceSTL (business attraction); ChamberSTL (public policy and advocacy); CentralCitySTL (strengthening Downtown and the urban core); and the Greater St. Louis Foundation (funding to support Greater St. Louis, Inc.’s charitable activities). Greater St. Louis, Inc. will be led by a chief executive officer. Each affiliate will be led by a president, who will report to the CEO of Greater St. Louis, Inc. Members of current organizations, such as the Regional Chamber, Downtown STL, Inc. and Civic Progress, will transition to be Greater St. Louis, Inc. members and will receive enhanced member services and engagement opportunities to help shape and implement the agenda. The organization will welcome businesses of all sizes to join as new members. Businesses may sign up to receive information about membership on the Greater St. Louis, Inc. website. “We must work together as a unified metro area across both sides of the river to help businesses and communities grow,” says Edmond Brown, founder and president of ELB Enterprises, Inc. of Alorton, Ill., and a longtime member of the St. Louis Regional Chamber Executive Committee. “I am excited by this vision of unity and inclusive growth to address some of the inequities in our community, and I look forward to seeing social and economic parity in the region.” Civic Progress, which helped build the capacity of many of the current organizations since its inception in 1953, will wind down operations at the end of the year. Its current President, Tom Santel, will retire but serve as a consultant to Greater St. Louis, Inc. during a transition period. “The establishment of Greater St. Louis, Inc. is a tremendous step forward that will enhance our region’s economic competitiveness and position it for strong inclusive growth in the future,” says Warner Baxter, current chair of Civic Progress. “This combination is consistent with Civic Progress’ legacy of taking bold steps to drive economic development for the St. Louis region.” The of the current organizations have asked Enterprise Holdings executive chairman, civic leader and philanthropist Andrew C. Taylor (left in photo) to serve as Greater St. Louis, Inc.’s founding chair. “I am proud to take on this role because I strongly believe we need this new integrated approach to economic development to advance growth and prosperity,” says Taylor, who currently chairs Arch to Park. “I love St. Louis, and I want our region to thrive for future generations.” Jason Hall, the current chief executive officer of Arch to Park (center in photo), will serve as Greater St. Louis, Inc.’s CEO. Valerie Patton, currently Senior Vice President, Inclusion & Talent Attraction, at the St. Louis Regional Chamber (right in photo), will serve as chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer of Greater St. Louis, Inc. and President of the Greater St. Louis Foundation. Hall and Patton were selected by the current board chairs of the combining organizations. Hall, Patton and Taylor have taken steps to incorporate Greater St. Louis, Inc. “It is an honor to lead Greater St. Louis, Inc.,” says Hall, a Granite City native who has an extensive background and track record in economic development, public policy and urban core revitalization. “Through this combination of strengths of five existing organizations, we are taking a bold step in renewing our commitment to being a vibrant, high-growth region that creates more opportunities for all. Economic transformation requires leadership, vision, and a long-term commitment to working together for shared outcomes. Greater St. Louis, Inc. gives us an opportunity to work together in the decades ahead to engage more people and businesses so that we can all achieve the ambition we have for St. Louis together.” Hall previously served as director and deputy director of the Missouri Department of Economic Development and as executive director of the Missouri Technology Corporation. “Greater St. Louis, Inc. will be a catalyst for increasing the number of quality jobs while also implementing strategies to achieve broad-based prosperity,” says Patton. “At the heart of Greater St. Louis, Inc. will be a focus on integrating principles of diversity, equity and inclusion into every element of the organization’s growth agenda. We must ensure that the broadest range of people and places benefit from economic growth. This work will make meaningful contributions to closing unacceptable racial disparities.” Patton is the founding executive director of the St. Louis Business Diversity Initiative, which helps professional people of color address the challenges they face in the workplace. She also launched the first-of-its-kind St. Louis Diverse Business Accelerator. “Everyone is aligned around making a meaningful, positive systems-change toward inclusive economic growth,” says Ken Cella, the St. Louis Regional Chamber’s current board chair. “By combining our efforts, the talents, strengths and perspectives of our organizations, we believe we can enable all in our St. Louis regional family to thrive.” Additionally, Steve Johnson will continue to lead the region’s coordinated business attraction efforts as chief business attraction officer of Greater St. Louis, Inc. and President of AllianceSTL. “The formation of AllianceSTL was an important step and investment in expanding our region’s business attraction capacity, and combining with other economic development groups. Greater St. Louis, Inc. will take that vision to a whole new level,” says Suzanne Sitherwood, the current AllianceSTL Board Chair. “We’re showing the world that St. Louis is ready to compete for new jobs, new businesses and new investment.” AllianceSTL was responsible for a major win in June, when Accenture Federal Services announced plans to open an Advanced Technology Services Center in St. Louis and bring up to 1,400 new technology jobs to the area over five years. AllianceSTL will continue to collaborate with local economic development organizations across the bistate metropolitan area to attract jobs and capital investment to St. Louis. Missy Kelley, the current CEO of Downtown STL, Inc. will transition into a new senior role in Greater St. Louis, Inc. One of Kelley’s initial responsibilities will be transitioning current Downtown STL, Inc. stakeholders and members and communication and economic development activities into the new organization. Over the past several years, Downtown STL, Inc. and Arch to Park collaborated with a broad range of Downtown stakeholders to develop Design Downtown STL, the first comprehensive and community-led downtown plan since Downtown Now! in 1999. During the first year, Greater St. Louis, Inc. will work with Downtown and urban core stakeholders to define the optimal structure for leading this critical work going forward. During the interim, the work to strengthen the urban core will be carried out under a common banner of CentralCitySTL. “Downtown St. Louis is the front door to our entire region,” says Ellen Theroff, board chair-elect of Downtown STL, Inc. “As we have seen in high-growth metro areas around the country, we cannot grow our region without a vibrant and growing urban core. Greater St. Louis, Inc. elevates Downtown and the urban core as a regional priority and sets a vision for inclusive growth that will have profound impacts throughout the region.” “Downtown and the urban core are experiencing tremendous momentum, with billions of dollars of investment underway,” says David Kemper, the chair of Arch to Park’s real estate fund. “Greater St. Louis, Inc. gives us the right platform to build on that momentum at scale.” Additional leaders of Greater St. Louis, Inc. will be named in the months ahead. Prior to the five organizations combining, internationally recognized economic development expert Bruce Katz, of New Localism Associates, was developing a 10-year, metro-scale, inclusive growth plan.

Brandon Marshall made the mistake during his Harvard appearance on Monday night of being honest about his misgivings toward the Miami Dolphins’ game plan against the Jets, and now he’s getting drilled for it. Check out what former NFL executive Michael Lombardi, now an analyst on the NFL Network, told WQAM’s Joe Rose this morning: “No receiver drops more balls than Brandon Marshall in the league,” Lombardi said. “He’s one of the top five receivers in dropping passes. … I wrote on my Twitter account that he’s not a No. 1 receiver. People [were] all over. Some agreed, some were giving me a bunch of junk, but the reality of it is No. 1 receivers don’t drop passes. Number 1 receivers are able to get down the field and make explosive plays.” Marshall, you’ll recall, caught just six passes for 109 yards in the 24-6 loss to the Jets on the Monday night stage. But he also was targeted a team-high13 times, dropped a tough chance in the end zone and stumbled out of bounds 46 yards into what could have been a much longer touchdown reception. “Brandon Marshall is a good player,” Lombardi continued. “He really is. And I’ve said this before, but he’s a yards-after-catch receiver. He needs to break tackles and get open. What he allowed [Darrelle] Revis to do to him showed he’s not a No. 1 guy. He’s got enough skills to be a No. 1 player but he doesn’t play like it, especially when he drops the ball.” Marshall does indeed lead all NFL receivers with seven drops — five for potential touchdowns — on 61 total targets. By comparison, Santonio Holmes has been targeted 40 times with the Jets and has zero drops. Hakeem Nicks, whom the Dolphins will face this Sunday against the Giants, hasn’t dropped any of the 50 passes sent his way. Marshall’s average of 14.2 yards per catch is tied for 47th in the league, a tick below Brian Hartline, the Dolphins’ leader at 14.3. However, Marshall also is on pace for a 1,288-yard receiving season, which would be the second-best of his career. His 34 catches put him on pace to finish with 91, which would mark a second time in as many years with the Dolphins in which he failed to reach triple digits. “For [Marshall] to take shots at the game plan, I think is really unfair,” Lombardi said. “It’s kind of a low blow. He could have done a couple things to help that team win [against the Jets], like catch a touchdown pass early in the game or not run out of bounds when nobody was pushing him out of bounds.” Your turn. Is Marshall still a No. 1 receiver? Was Lombardi fair in this criticism? Or have you had enough of the Beast/Monster halfway through his second season in a Dolphins uniform?

Larson is postponed at this time. He was the man his son will always hope to be someday. A former Methodist minister and a legend on the religion beat, Roy Larson was The Chicago Reporter’s second publisher, succeeding founder John McDermott. He died last Tuesday at 90, according to his son Mark Larson. “He always seemed to be embroiled in some controversy and it felt so noble to me,” Larson said of his father. Those controversies peaked in September 1981, when Larson, William Clements and Gene Mustain at the Chicago Sun-Times broke a story that shook Chicago and the Catholic establishment. After 18 months, the team reported that Cardinal John Patrick Cody was under investigation for allegedly funneling upwards of $1 million in archdiocese funds to a friend. “I remember during the Cardinal Cody story he would talk to us about it but in hushed terms,” Larson said, “He whispered in his own house.” Larson remembers heading down to the Billy Goat Tavern on Lower Michigan Avenue with his father the night before the story ran to get the first copies from the press and meeting Mike Royko there. “He wanted us to be a part of it,” he said. Larson, a religion reporter and editor at the Chicago Sun Times before he joined the Reporter, established his legacy largely on the strength of that investigation, which was among the first to probe the Catholic church, an entity that at the time seemed beyond reproach in the city. Cody died in 1982 and the investigation was ultimately closed before any of the allegations could be proven. Writing for Nieman Reports about the work in 2003, Larson quoted Don H. Reuben, an attorney for Cody, who said at the time, “the Cardinal is answerable to Rome and to God, not to the Sun-Times.” Larson, who worked alongside Roger Ebert and Royko, left the Sun-Times after Rupert Murdoch bought the paper. “My dad was crestfallen, he loved his job at the Sun-Times,” Larson said, “He loved to go to work.” Larson would lead the Reporter from 1985 to 1994 before handing over the reins to Laura Washington, a star reporter who had left the publication to join the Harold Washington administration. “I started there at kind of an interesting time. Some things are really fuzzy, like who exactly did what story or when something occurred, but everything was full of energy,” Larson told the Reporter in a 2013 interview. “Harold Washington had just become the first black mayor, and that raised many questions and small debates about how the Reporter should report this.” “Roy brought his considerable skills as a newsman to the Reporter at a critical time,” said Washington, now a columnist for the Sun-Times. “That take-no-prisoners philosophy encouraged us to reach high and probe deeply.” “He was a stickler for both facts and fairness that kept the Reporter honest and effective,” she said. “In the pursuit of truth, we will go where the news is, and rarely is it possible to know beforehand precisely where that will lead,” Larson wrote in the July 1985 issue of the Reporter, the first with his name atop the masthead. “I agreed to take on this job because I believe the Chicago area needs The Chicago Reporter.” The issue featured stories from Ben Joravsky, now at the Sun-Times and the Chicago Reader, on disparities in disbursements of community development block grants, the paucity of blacks and Hispanics in suburban gifted programs by reporter Kevin Blackistone and a profile by Susan Gallagher on the competitive pressures facing Harold P. Pierce, the man behind Harold’s Chicken, and his “Cadillac” delivery service. Washington credits Larson with introducing a more intellectual approach to the publication, which was primarily known for “statistical indictments of American society’s shortcomings,” according to 1987 Chicago Tribune profile marking the Reporter’s 15th anniversary. “He took us to a new level by introducing essays, literature, book reviews, and new designs that made the Reporter’s work far more accessible and engaging,” she said. “What Larson set out to do was professionalize the Reporter,” said Tom Brune, Washington bureau chief of Newsday and Chicago Reporter alum. “A little more so than McDermott and the kid editors who ran the place.” “He was very important, he kept the Reporter going,” Brune said. One of the biggest investigations under Larson’s leadership came in June 1986, when reporter Martha Allen broke a story about the presence of asbestos pipe insulation at the Ida B. Wells public housing complex on the South Side. After learning that workers were removing the dangerous substance from Chicago Housing Authority offices there, the Reporter obtained and analyzed samples that showed residents were being exposed at several public housing projects. Eventually, the CHA removed asbestos from “more than 1,200 homes in the Ida B. Wells, Wells Extension, Altgeld, Murray and Darrow housing complexes” at a cost of at least $8.9 million, according to the August 1987 edition of the Reporter. Organizing around the issue was a part of former President Barack Obama’s community activism in Chicago and was chronicled in his book “Dreams From My Father.” “It was a very strong big story. Larson oversaw it. That was a big feather in his cap,” said Brune. During Larson’s tenure, the Reporter also went from spartan newsletter to polished magazine. “When I got there, it was horrible, just ugly, even by 1980s standards,” said John Schrag, who was hired in 1985 as a reporter and rose to managing editor under Larson. He is now executive editor of the Pamplin Media Group in Portland, Oregon. “He recognized that it needed to look better. We were one of the first organizations to do what was then called desktop publishing.” Larson also hired reporter Laurie Abraham to launch “Sick and Poor in Chicago,” a series on urban healthcare that debuted in September 1989 and would later become a book by Abraham titled “Mama Might Be Better Off Dead: The Failure of Health Care in Urban America.” A lengthy excerpt appeared in the Chicago Reader in 1993. According to the acknowledgements section of the book, Larson hired Abraham “to bring ‘people’ into the investigative publication’s health care reporting. We envisioned a series of stories on health care for the poor, though neither of us was sure what form it should take. But, Roy said, if the articles were successful, perhaps I might expand the series into a book. Roy’s trust in me, his faith in both my writing and my ability to conceive and execute such a project, launched the book.” In 1990, Linda Lenz, a former colleague of Larson’s at the Sun-Times, arrived at Community Renewal Society, the Reporter’s parent organization, with an idea to cover education that would become Catalyst Chicago magazine. “Roy melded my idea with CRS’s idea for a newsletter for parents, and together we went in search of funding. As it turned out, the MacArthur and Joyce foundations had been looking for a way to track implementation of the Reform Act, and The Chicago Community Trust was interested in assisting parents,” Lenz wrote in 2015, before the publication merged with the Reporter. Larson also served as its publisher. A look at Larson’s legacy “A lot of organizations do not survive the succession of their founder,” Schrag said, “and The Chicago Reporter did. I think Roy gets all the credit for that. He hired a good staff. He let us do our jobs. He kept the financial ship afloat. He gave us a vision.” Larson left the Reporter in 1994 to establish the Garrett-Medill Center for Religion and the News Media, a joint project of Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary and the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, according to a 40th anniversary Reporter profile. Larson was born and raised in Moline, Illinois, and edited “Line O’ Type,” his school paper, according to a profile published by the Religion News Association to celebrate a 2014 lifetime achievement award. He graduated in 1951 from Augustana College with a bachelor’s degree and received a Master of Divinity degree from Garrett-Evangelical in 1955. Larson was living at the Monarch Landing senior community in Naperville, according to his son Mark. He is also survived by his wife Dorothy — they would have celebrated their 70th anniversary this year — his daughter Jodie, and seven grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.

Alumni Hall Alumni features the School of Nursing, School of Education, Health and Human Behavior, the Air Force ROTC, and a number of departments, such as geography, psychology and aerospace studies. 4. Peck Hall Peck Hall houses the College of Arts and Sciences and many general education classes. The Departments of Anthropology, Political Science, History, Sociology, Social Work, English, Foreign Languages & Literature and Philosophy also call Peck Hall home. 5. Lovejoy Library Not only is Lovejoy home to all of our library resources, its basement also contains Information Technology Services. Here, one can get assistance when trying to connect a game console to the internet in the residence halls, resetting their e-ID or connecting to Eduroam, the campus Wi-Fi for students. The library is named after Elijah P. Lovejoy, a local reporter and editor who advocated for the abolition of slavery before the Civil War. Lovejoy was killed by a pro-slavery mob in Alton, Illinois. 6. Dunham Hall Because the building is named after beloved dancer and choreographer Katherine Dunham, it’s only fitting it houses the Department of Theater and Dance as well as a large theater. The Departments of Music and Mass Communications can also be found in Dunham. SIUE’s jazz radio station, WSIE-FM, is housed in the basement. 7. Science Buildings Together, Science East and Science West contain most of the university’s biology, chemistry, physics and environmental sciences classes, as well as the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. 8. Morris University Center The MUC is the hub of campus. Numerous dining options are held within its walls (see page 11), as well as Dining Services’ offices. On the lower level, you’ll find Cougar Lanes, which features a bowling alley, pool tables, ping-pong tables and a video game arcade. 9. Art and Design Buildings The two Art and Design buildings, Art and Design and Art and Design West, house the department’s main office, as well as an art gallery. Most art classes are held here. 10. Center for Spirituality & Sustainability Known as “the dome” due to its geodesic shape, the center offers a place for all faiths to come together, as well as quiet spaces to connect with one’s spiritual side. The building is home to the interfaith organization Baha’i of Edwardsville, Holy Temple Lifeline Ministry services, Light of Compassion Buddhist Society and the Newman Catholic Community. 11. Metcalf Student Experimental Theater This is the second theater on campus, and, as its name suggests, it is designed to give students the opportunity to explore many different aspects of theater production. Like Dunham, the Metcalf also hosts shows. The theater was named after former budget director James F. Metcalf, and fans of the television show “Roseanne” will recognize him as the father of Tony award winning actress Laurie Metcalf. 12. Student Fitness Center The Student Fitness Center is the campus’ go-to workout destination, as it boasts two weight rooms, an indoor track and cardio machines. Here, one will be able to join group fitness classes and obtain information about intramural sports. The SFC also has courts that can be reserved to play basketball, volleyball, tennis or soccer. One can also visit SIUE’s indoor pool, rock climbing wall, racquetball courts or saunas (which are now closed due to COVID-19) inside the SFC. 13. Vadalabene Center Here, Cougars volleyball and basketball go head to head with their competition. The VC is also where students can find numerous applied health classes. 14. Early Childhood Center The Early Childhood Center provides childcare for students, faculty and other SIUE community members. The ECC serves children ages 2-5, and the program runs year-round. In addition, some of the School of Education, Health and Human Behavior’s classes and practicums are held here. 16. University Police In the event you need to file a police report, visit the University Police Department. Contact University Police through their non-emergency line at 650-3324. 19. Engineering Building You can find School of Engineering classes, advisers, professors and administrators here. It is one of the largest buildings on campus, and its blue windows make it one of the most distinctive buildings at SIUE. 23. 200 University Park This building is home to the School of Pharmacy and the University Marketing and Communications department. At the beginning of each semester, it is filled with students visiting Textbook Services. 27. School of Pharmacy Lab Located next to 200 University Park, the School of Pharmacy Lab is home to SOP lab classes. 29. Ralph Korte Stadium Korte is where SIUE’s soccer and track teams host their home games and meets. The area around the stadium is where soccer tailgating is held. 32. Stratton Quadrangle This semi-grassy area between the MUC, Lovejoy Library, Dunham Hall, Peck Hall and Rendleman Hall is more commonly known as “The Quad.” The MUC Truck, SIUE’s food truck, often visits The Quad, and many public events take place here (although there may be fewer this year due to COVID-19). Near Dunham and Lovejoy, one will see a large, spray-painted rock. “The Rock” is available to be painted by all students. 46. Student Success Center Connected to the MUC is the SSC, which features a computer lab, an open lounge and group meeting spaces. To best serve students, these amenities are open 24 hours, seven days a week. The SSC is also home to ACCESS, the Career Development Center, Counseling Services, Health Service and International Student Services. 49. Simmon’s Baseball Complex Here, SIUE’s baseball team practices and hosts home games. The Roy E. Lee Field, named for the first Cougar baseball coach, is located inside the complex.

plunging 70%, Dallas software company CEO Rishi Khanna quickly decided to cut the salaries of all 12 of his employees rather than lay some of them off. Job cuts, he says, would have hurt employee morale at the firm, ISHIR. Plus, he adds, “we did not want to lose any of our key people.” And with layoffs ravaging the economy, staffers were receptive to the pay cuts even though they still put in 40 hours or more a week. “I knew many people that were already being furloughed or totally laid off,” says Bill Luisi, ISHIR’s senior director of sales, who took a 20% pay cut. “I felt grateful to have an opportunity.” The layoffs and furloughs of more than 25 million U.S. workers have understandably fueled most of the nation’s anguish over the coronavirus recession. But that\'s not the only economic setback for workers: Many companies are trimming employees’ hours or wages to reduce costs – either instead of, or in addition to, the job cuts. For workers, a smaller paycheck may be a welcome alternative to losing a job, but economists say it still could hurt consumer spending and the economy, and represent an even more enduring legacy of the downturn than the layoffs. . Nearly half of the nation’s net job losses in early spring have been recouped, though recovering the rest could take a few years, economists say. Still, “you’ll see the employment level be restored more quickly than wage growth,” says economist Dante DeAntonio of Moody’s Analytics. Across the economy, most workers are not seeing their pay cut, but they are grappling with wage freezes or meager increases. From March through June, employers froze the wages of 58% of their workers, up from 36% during the same period last year, according to a recent study by the University of Chicago and payroll processor ADP. In the second quarter, the wages and salaries of private-sector workers edged up 0.4%, the smallest increase in five years, according to the Labor Department’s Employment Cost Index. Most affected by the reductions in hours or pay are furloughed employees returning to work, socking them with a one-two punch of financial distress. And while cuts in hours – which result in lower weekly paychecks, of course – are more prevalent, a historically large share of U.S. employers, like ISHIR, have taken the unusual step of reducing hourly wages or salaries during the downturn. Classic cars: These 1990s vehicles are hot on the collectible car market In April, the vast majority of unemployed Americans – 18 million -- said they were on temporary layoff or furlough, Labor Department figures show. About 40% of furloughed employees have returned to work, according to Gusto, a payroll and benefits provider to more than 100,000 small businesses. Of those, 29% have come back to fewer hours or lower wages, according to figures through August that Gusto provided exclusively to USA TODAY. That compares with just 17% of a much smaller pool of furloughed workers called back during the same period last year. Many workers have been recalled by restaurants or shops, for example, that mostly or completely shut down in the early days of the crisis, and then reopened but without indoor dining or at lower capacity and limited hours. That curtailed workers’ schedules and pay. “When they come back, it doesn’t mean they’re coming back to a rosy picture,” says Sarah Gustafson, Gusto’s lead data scientist. “They’re kind of getting a double whammy.” San Diego-based Positive Adventures, which runs corporate team-building and outdoor youth education events, furloughed most of its nine full-time employees in March when sales vanished, CEO Melissa Lopez says. After she secured a forgivable federal loan, she brought back five of the workers and generated some revenue through summer camps and virtual events. But in July, after she exhausted the federal money and with sales still down 80%, she scaled back their schedules to 20 to 30 hours a week. When she did, “I was so nervous I would lose people,” Lopez says. She says she expects to restore their hours when business returns, though she’s unsure when that will happen.

While lower-paid hourly workers are more likely to see their schedules, rather than their hourly wages, trimmed, salaried employees are more likely to suffer outright pay cuts, Gusto’s data shows. That’s partly because it can be difficult to clip the hours of salaried employees who don’t punch a clock, says Daniel Sternberg, Gusto’s head of data science. Nearly 7 million workers endured wage decreases from March through June, according to the study by the University of Chicago and ADP. Among employees who weren’t laid off during that period, 6.2% suffered wage cuts, up from 1.6% during the same period last year, the study says. During the Great Recession of 2007-09, 6% of workers took wage cuts but many firms may still slice pay this year, the report says, suggesting the eventual share could be far higher. “Base wage cuts are a remarkable feature of the labor market in the Pandemic Recession,” the study says. Traditionally, companies prefer to lay off some workers than reduce wages broadly, which typically hurts morale and prompts the best staffers to leave, say Sudarshan Sampath, research director for PayScale, a compensation data and software company that advises employers. Layoffs, by contrast, offer firms an opportunity to cut the worst performers, he says. And while employee schedules can be expanded as business comes back, wages can be more difficult to restore because ""there\'s not as clear a mechanism"" other than employers keeping their word , Moody’s DeAntonio says. Pay cuts also can hurt morale by implying that workers are performing poorly, Gustafson says. But this slump is different. The sudden and dramatic plunge in revenue as states shut down businesses in March forced many firms to do whatever they could to survive. And many companies believed the “pandemic’s impact on business performance would be short-lived,” Sampath says. The highest-paid workers have been hit hardest by the pay reductions, with 13.4% of employees in the top 20% based on wages experiencing salary cuts between March and June, says the University of Chicago-ADP study. With layoffs prevalent, pay cuts at the top could represent “shared sacrifice across the organization,” Sternberg says. Early in the crisis, myriad companies announced executive pay cuts, including Delta, Marriott, Bed Bath and Beyond, Nordstrom and Macy’s. Khanna, the Dallas software CEO, says he couldn’t lay off ISHIR\'s poor performers because his boutique firm has none. And he couldn’t reduce employee hours because they’re focused on completing projects for other companies and often put in more than 40 hours a week. He decided to cut the pay of top executives by 20%; midlevel managers by 15%; and lower-level employees by 10%. He says he wanted to minimize the pain for young workers already coping with relatively low salaries. Luisi, the sales director, says his 20% cut has prompted him to defer the planned renovation of his kitchen and living room -- a $50,000 project – and the purchase of a new bike. “I looked at this as an extraordinary time,” says Luisi, who has worked in the software business for more than four decades and earns a six-figure salary. Goodbye to the office?: \'We’re compiling lessons learned\': GM, Facebook, Twitter policies pave the way for remote work across US Although many workers are taking wage reductions in stride, stagnant pay or meager increases could be tough for the economy to shake. Even after the nation recovered all the jobs lost in the Great Recession by early 2014, modest annual wage growth of about 2% persisted for more than another year. “We’ve had a long period of low inflation,” DeAntonio says, a dynamic that limits the ability and need of businesses to boost pay. “That’s not a driver of strong wage growth.”'}]"
