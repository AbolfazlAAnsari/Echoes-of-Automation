The man then gestured to the Mexico side of the boundary, where additional armed subjects were located. There were no reported injuries, according to a CBP spokesman. Over the last month, Sasabe, Mexico, has become a hotbed of cartel violence and almost all residents have fled the area. The news comes as Fox Business reported that 10 IEDs were found and an armed man was taken into custody. CBP could not confirm the discovery of the IEDs as it says it cannot comment on information in leaked communications. But officials did say sectors routinely provide officer safety alerts to agents to notify them of what is occurring in the field and to remind them to maintain their vigilance and take care of each other. But Fox Business reported the IEDs were seized by the Mexican military. Sasabe is not the only border town dealing with cartel violence. An Arivaca rancher told 13 News that she heard a gun battle on Wednesday. “We could hear automatic weapons and the helicopters were here, Border Patrol was here, so they were making sure that you know, we were safe,” said Lori Lindsay, who owns Tres Bellotas Ranch.
