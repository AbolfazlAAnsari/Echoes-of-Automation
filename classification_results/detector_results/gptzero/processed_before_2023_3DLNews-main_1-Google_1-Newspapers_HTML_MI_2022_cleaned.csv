Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 10:17 pm Sports Editor Cadillac’s Charlie Howell scrambles for some yardage during Friday’s Big North Conference contest at Gaylord. GAYLORD — There’s some cliche out there about defense winning championships. Or something like that. if that’s the case, it worked for Cadillac on Friday. The Vikings struggled mightily offensively but forced turnovers and made big plays when they needed to defensively in beating Gaylord 19-9 in a Big North Conference football contest. The win gives Cadillac (3-2 overall, 2-0 BNC) at least a share of the league title. They can win it outright next Friday at Petoskey as the league goes with just four teams this season. Cadillac forced Gaylord (3-2, 1-1) into four turnovers and it led directly to the Vikings’ scoring opportunities. “We got turnovers and that’s been a big point of emphasis for us,” Cadillac coach Shawn Jackson said. “We got three-and-outs and we got takeaways. “The kids did a great job there tonight.” The biggest takeaway might’ve come in the second quarter. Cadillac’s Seth Dilley got a sack and a fumble recovery and the Vikings converted it into a 13-yard pass play from Charlie Howell to Grant Williams for a 6-3 lead with 6:00 to go in the fisrt half. “That was a huge play,” Jackson said. “We might’ve gone into halftime down 3-0. “The kids rallied to the ball and we played really well on defense.” The teams traded turnovers in the third quarter as Cadillac sputtered offensively. That’s something Jackson said needs to be fixed and fast. “We just played poorly offensively,” he said. “We’d get three or four yards and then we’d break down up front. “We just never got going. I think it’s finding the right people in the right places on the line. We’ve got to re-evaluate what we’re doing up front.” Cadillac deflected a pass early in the fourth quarter and Derek Rood scored on a 1-yard run a play later to make it 12-3 with 11:50 remaining. The Vikings forced another turnover and scored on a 3-yard pass from Howell to Rood for a 19-3 lead with 6:10 remaining. The Vikings totaled just 122 yards of offense. Howell was 8 of 22 for 50 yards while Kaleb McKinley carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. Chris Reinhold led the way defensively with 10 tackles while Teegan Baker had 10 tackles and picked off a pass. Eli Main added seven tackles while Keenan Suminski also picked off a pass. Dilley had two fumble recoveries and Evan Hughes forced a fumble. sports@cadillacnews.com | 775-NEWS (6397) Sports Editor Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'By Don Rush on September 28, 2022No Comment I must be getting soft (and, not just in the belly). It seems the older I get the softer I get in regards to demeanor. I prefer not to yell, jump up and down like an angry three-year-old, point fingers nor call people names (unless it’s actually their names). I think I know why, too. I’ve always kinda’ gone against the expected grain. I’ve done things my way, even if it ain’t the right way. Speaking of right ways, the way to write political letters to the editor these days is to go against today’s societal norms. These days we’ve been brain-washed to believe the only way to express our political viewpoints is not to tout them, it’s to point fingers, call names and demean those with differing political views. It’s in the broadcast commercials we hear and see. It’s in the posts we read on social media. And, here at your community newspaper, we’re starting to get letters to the editor with that same “damn the other guy” writing style. I, like many of you, ain’t a fan of that. I know, I know. I know there are still some history buffs out there who know and who are gonna’ ring my chimes and say, “But, Don. Even back in the earliest years of this Constitutionally Limited Republic, politics has been dirty and ugly. Newspapers used to run articles defaming and possibly libeling people all the time. Stop being so soft. Why are you wimping out now, 240 years later? ” (I’ll answer that question in a jiff, but first . . .) For those not familiar with the term “Constitutionally Limited Republic,” what I am about to type might blow your mind. Many folks think I’m a far right-winged, loony-toon, neo-nazi because I have stated before the United States really isn’t a true democracy (where nine cannibals can vote to eat the tenth). The US is a constitutionally limited republic. This is not a “conservative” notion. Just the opposite, it’s a “political philosophy of limited government” where “government is limited in power.” And, it is a “key concept in the history of liberalism.” The creation of the US was a liberal idea. So, if I believe this, what does that make me – liberal or conservative? Okay, let’s get back on track. Why am I wimping out now, 240 years later when it comes to publishing letters to the editor for our community newspaper? As Liz Barrett Browning once wrote, “Let me count the ways.” 1. Because we are a “community” newspaper. Community is made up of people. People are neighbors and I would hope that they are good neighbors. I would promote civility in our community. Does yelling or screaming at your neighbor really make anyone feel good? 2. If it’s really popular on social media, it’s probably a good idea not to follow suit. 3. Letters attacking others often lead community newspapers to be sued for libel – most libel suits brought against newspapers are not from the articles they publish, rather from the letters to the editor written by someone else and published without first vetting said letters. I know lawyers are all sweet, cuddly wonderful people, but I’d rather not have to give them extra money to defend a libel suit. 4. Last, and most important, I am wimping out, because I can. If you don’t like it, tough. Go cry about the social injustices of one Donald Rush, Neanderthal Philosopher on social media if it makes you feel better. I am still not gonna’ run your letter. We will publish your letter if it meets our “Letters Policy” which we run regularly. In these politically charged times where everyone is so passionate this can be challenging. So, I’m gonna make it easy for you. In your political letters, with reason, write why you are for something or someone, versus tearing down the opposing view or candidate. It’s best to use researched information versus copied pablum from some partisan source. Easy squeezy, right! Include your name, your address and your daytime phone number. We will not publish your contact information, but we run letters from local people about local issues. If a letter is addressed from out of town or state and not really about something local, I feel no compulsion to run it. We use the phone number to verify you are the actual letter writer and not someone pretending to be you (which is easily done online). So, there you go. Some tough love from the old softy. Be nice in your letters to the editor. Good voting to all!

It\'s almost easier to say what didn\'t happen than what did. Last year was no exception, as the greater Coldwater area faced rejection of a millage that would have financially supported Branch County\'s nursing home facility, a looming budget strain for the county and a midterm election that heralded a sea change in Michigan. Here\'s what we deemed the most impactful topics of 2022: What is next for Maple Lawn? The county-owned nursing home continues to hold its with cash flow month to month, but its long-term financially viability is uncertain after voters balked in November at a five-year millage that would have supported the facility. Voters turned down a five-year .99 millage Nov. 8 that would have provided long-term funding for the financially troubled county-owned nursing home. The tax would have generated $1.656 million per year, or $8.28 million over five years. The state is seeking repayment of $874,976 in Medicaid funds based on reduced occupancy during COVID-19 for the past two years. Before the state agreed to delay repayments, Maple Lawn Administrator Jayne Sabaitis went to the Branch County Commission and received permission to borrow up to $1 million in American Rescue Plan funds to cover cash flow to keep paying employees and expenses. She has not yet needed that county money. In 2016, the Branch County commission approved $9.96 million in 30-year revenue bonds to add 31 more private rooms and completely renovate the nursing home — even though it had lost money in four of its previous seven years. Maple Lawn is using Medicare, Medicaid and federal reimbursement — which comprise about 90 percent of its revenues — to make those payments. What began as a fairly benign school board meeting in Quincy ended in controversy after staff aired grievances over pay scale confusion and unruly behavior in the middle and high school lunchrooms. At the heart of the issue is what many schools across the state and the country face: low staffing challenges. Because the district is struggling to attract new staff, the superintendent began working with administrators to identify strategies to reduce the numbers of students in the lunchroom at one time. Since the issue was brought to the board\'s attention, staff have separated the seventh and eighth grade lunch periods, reducing the numbers to 90 students rather than the nearly 200 students that previously frequented the room at once. The challenge included the layout of the building because the high school and middle school are joined. Compounding that was the employee shortage since the 2020 COVID-19 shutdown. Officials said they are continuing to work toward creative ways to bring on more staff. Other areas of Branch County also saw challenges in attracting workers. The county itself saw 20-30 open positions at the beginning of the year. In January, administrator Bud Norman said it was a similar outlook for the national economy, where the U.S. saw up to 11.09 million vacancies in November 2021. Over the year and heading in to 2023 planning, multiple areas of the county requested either raises or more staffing. By the end of the year, the county had its books balanced, but warned of a possible financial crisis in 2024 if current trends continue. Commissioners approved the 2023 budget in December, but had to dip into its savings by more than $1 million to do so. The county slashed funding for some safety net funds that benefit children and said expenses need to be cut or more revenues identified to ensure the county is solvent into 2024. One of the most drawn-out issues of the year ... will stretch into another year as a decision on the long-proposed solar farm in Ovid Township will now have to wait at least until Jan. 9. Apex Clean Energy is asking for the township\'s blessing on a special-use permit to build a Colwater solar farm. At issue are setback requirements, complaints of residents and evolving zoning rules and procedures in local government. The 150-megawatt solar farm would span 1,109 acres under lease in Ovid Township and 571 acres in Coldwater Township. The morning after the November midterm election, Democratic Michiganders awoke to discover they\'d kept the governorship, secretary of state and attorney general offices — in addition to passing all three statewide proposals and flipping the state House and Senate for the first time since the \'80s. Following the U.S. Supreme Court\'s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June, voters approved an amendment to enshrine abortion rights in the state\'s constitution. Proposal 3 establishes a ""fundamental right to reproductive freedom"" which includes — but is not limited to — the right to seek abortion. It also protects a right to contraception and infertility care. Michigan voters also adopted Proposal 2, a wide-ranging constitutional amendment to establish early voting, preempt efforts to enact more stringent voter ID rules and expand access to absentee voting. Perhaps the most bipartisan support came for Proposal 1, a ballot proposal that modifies term limits for state legislators and requires them, the governor and others holding top elected offices in the state to disclose information about their finances that could reveal potential conflicts of interest.'}]"

Mortgage rates fell back to 6.61% based on data released Nov. 17. Mortgage rates don\'t directly track the Fed’s rate hikes. Instead, mortgage rates follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which is influenced by inflation expectations. The downturn in housing, Manaenkov said, is likely to drive businesses to be more cautious due to deteriorating economic projections. Banks are likely to tighten credit further and households are bound to cut back spending and increase savings. All will drive a fading momentum for the U.S. economy, he said. More:Fed hikes interest rate again by 75 basis points as inflation refuses to cool After the Fed\'s latest rate hike in early November, the short-term federal funds rate now runs in the range of 3.75% to 4%. It had been close to zero before the rate hikes began. The Fed is expected to raise rates, possibly by 50 basis points according to some forecasts, at its next meeting Dec. 13 and Dec. 14. The U-M forecast anticipates that the Fed could start cutting short term interest rates by early 2024, which would help to stabilize the job market. More:Is a recession inevitable in 2023? What the experts are saying Michigan\'s auto industry, though, could end up being better off than in previous recessions, according to the report, thanks to a backlog of demand that will help car and truck sales grow in a tough economy. The U-M forecast calls for car and light truck sales to grow to 15.5 million by 2024 — up from 13.9 million in 2022 — as supply chains improve and inventories continue to normalize. The forecast calls for 15.1 million cars and light trucks to be sold in 2023. The auto industry\'s shift to electrification, the economists said, should support labor demand with investments in assembly and battery production plants. ""If the auto industry is able to avoid major potholes ahead, it could end up towing the state\'s labor market forward along with it,"" according to the Michigan Economic Outlook. Michigan\'s construction and nonautomotive manufacturing industries face a ""challenging environment with rising interest rates, a strong dollar, and weak national growth,"" the report noted. ""We are hoping that continued strength in the automotive sector will shield Michigan from the brunt of the recession."" Michigan\'s unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 4.1% through the middle of 2023. It it expected to hit 4.7% by early 2024. But U-M economists say the Michigan jobless rate will begin declining again in late 2024, as the national economy improves. Contact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com. Follow her on Twitter @tompor.

Feb. 21, 2022. (StringerTASS via Getty Images via JTA) (JTA) — All of the posturing and fears and hypothesizing became reality early Thursday morning in Ukraine, as Russia launched a full-scale armed invasion by land and sea. Tens of thousands of Jews live in Ukraine, making it home to one of the world’s largest Jewish communities — one with a complicated history, tainted by persecution and upheaval, that is tangibly affecting their response to the attack. Here’s a breakdown of who they are, where they live and what they are experiencing. We’ll add to this explainer as we learn more. What do you want to know about Ukraine’s Jews right now? Let us know. After weeks of ominous reports on Russia’s plans to attempt to annex parts of Ukraine — a former member of the Soviet Union that has over time grown close to NATO and Western powers, a fact that infuriates the Kremlin — Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on television early Thursday that he had initiated a “special military operation.” As he did so, explosions were heard in the capital Kyiv and several other large Ukrainian cities. This is the second time in the past decade that Putin has invaded parts of the country — in 2014, Russia annexed territory in the Crimea region, kickstarting months of fighting near the two countries’ borders. But early signs show that this new conflict could quickly progress to a larger-scale affair. Explosions and Russian troops have now been reported all the way from Crimea in the east to the Lviv area in the west, and Ukrainian officials are estimating dozens of soldiers and civilians are already dead. Most analysts are calling the escalation Europe’s most significant armed conflict since World War II. Over 10,000 Russian and Ukrainian troops were killed in the 2014 war. This is a difficult question to answer with specificity, complicated by the cultural makeup of Ukrainian Jewry and its history. A 2020 demographic study of European Jewry puts the number of Ukrainians who identify as Jews at 43,000. But some estimates of people with Jewish ancestry quadruple that number. Despite centuries of antisemitism and pogroms that condensed Jewish populations into pockets of Eastern Europe, such as the Pale of Settlement, which included a large portion of modern Ukraine — and was known for its shtetls, and as the setting of “Fiddler on the Roof” — it is estimated that over 1.5 million Jews lived in what is now Ukraine on the eve of World War II. Approximately 1 million of those Jews were killed in the Holocaust, but a 1989 census estimated that close to half a million lived in Ukraine in 1989, before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Under Soviet rule, Jews were persecuted and additionally denied the right to emigrate, forced to hide much of their religious practice in a society rife with antisemitism. After the Soviet Union collapsed, close to 80% of those Jews left for Israel and elsewhere. Many of those who remained are elderly and poor, and others are disconnected from their Jewish heritage, perhaps from the decades of persecution. For example, the 2020 demographic survey estimated that besides a “core” population of 43,000 Jews, around 200,000 Ukrainians are technically eligible for Israeli citizenship, meaning that they have identifiable Jewish ancestry. The European Jewish Congress says that number could be as high as 400,000. We’ve covered attempts by international Jewish organizations to care for the country’s remaining Jewish population, to revitalize younger generations of Ukrainian Jews and even to attract some to Israel. Most of Ukraine’s Jews live in the country’s largest cities, but some, especially elderly ones, live in smaller cities and scattered impoverished villages. So this list — which contains estimates of people with Jewish heritage, some provided by the communities themselves — is not comprehensive. Because Russia’s attack has taken aim at the entire country, all Jewish communities face exposure to violence and the consequences of war. Kyiv: Ukraine’s capital city of close to 3 million people is home to about 110,000 Jews and half a dozen active synagogues. Dnipro: This eastern city, which was off limits for unauthorized civilians during the Communist era because of its multiple military complexes, now has about 60,000 Jews, according to communal figures. It houses kosher restaurants, a synagogue, a mikvah and multiple Jewish-owned businesses, and in 2012 construction finished on a 22-story building that’s shaped like a menorah. Kharkiv: This industrial city near the Russian border is one of Ukraine’s largest, and about 45,000 Jews call it home, according to the community’s own statistics. Odessa: This southern port city of about a million people also has 45,000 Jews, according to communal statistics, four active synagogues, a Jewish museum, two Jewish community centers and no fewer than a dozen Jewish schools or kindergartens. It also is home to four orphanages for Jewish children, run by the Hasidic Chabad-Lubavitch movement. In the late 19th century, Jews made up over a third of the city’s population. Uman: This small city houses the grave of the 18th-century Hasidic Rabbi Nahman of Breslov, which attracts ten of thousands of Hasidic Jews in an annual tribute pilgrimage. But a few hundred Jews, mostly Israelis, now live there year-round. Lviv: This western city, near Poland, is home to a few small Jewish communities of 100-200 people each. Given their traumatic history, Ukrainian Jews are feeling more than a little frightened at the possibility of a protracted war. In Odessa, Rabbi Shlomo Baksht explained to his orphan children that “there was a war but that they are not being targeted.” He told our Cnaan Lipshiz that some were assured by that, “but others not really and the fear stayed in their eyes.” Last month we reported that some were getting their suitcases ready. But due to the widespread nature of the violence, erupting from all sides — which led Ukrainian airports to cancel all commercial flights — many local Jews, like non-Jews, are being forced to stay put for now. For many of the elderly experiencing poverty, anxiety and seclusion already worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, the situation will bring new physical and psychological challenges, said Amos Lev-Ran, a senior employee of the former-Soviet-Union division of the U.S.-based American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee charity, or JDC, which is a major provider of care to needy Jews in Ukraine. ”As things worsen, those needs are becoming more pressing,” Lev-Ran said. The JDC has already been stepping up its contributions in recent months, adding $4.4 million in aid spending since November. Some others — mostly of a generation removed from the Soviet Union era — have assimilated into Ukraine’s patriotic culture, and want to protect their homeland at all costs. “I put off making any big purchases. I want to buy weapons,” Vlodymyr Zeev Vaksman, the 40-year-old chair of Odessa’s Tiferet Masorti community, told JTA earlier this month. That said, thousands of Ukrainians are also fleeing into nearby countries such as Poland and Hungary. Last weekend, a letter that Bathsheba Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, sent to the U.N.’s high commissioner for human rights began circulating. In it, Crocker wrote that the United States believes that in the aftermath of an invasion, Russia will look to target a list of specific people “who oppose Russian actions” through “killings, kidnappings/forced disappearances, unjust detentions, and the use of torture.” On that list, Crocker wrote, alongside political dissidents, LGBTQ activists and others, are “vulnerable populations such as religious and ethnic minorities.” That prompted some on social media to speculate whether that includes Jews.

precious for the Koledo family. Here Bridget Koledo and her husband Ed share some quality time on the water with their sons, Tony (left) and Jimmy. Submitted photo View Newspaper Group is pleased to announce that Bridget Koledo has joined their team as a marketing specialist. Koledo will focus on helping customers in Fenton, Linden, Holly, Grand Blanc, Ortonville and Goodrich grow their business through marketing in the Tri-County Times, Genesee County View and The Citizen. She also will work with the View Newspaper Group brand team to execute community events including the first-ever View Lady Classic golf outing in Fenton on Monday, Aug. 29 at Fenton Farms Golf Club and the fourth annual Bottles, Brews & News craft beer and wine fest set for Sept. 24 in downtown Fenton. Koledo, a former Linden school teacher, is no stranger to community involvement. Linden Community Schools was proud to call her one of their own for over 15 years during which she worked as an elementary teacher specializing in math and science, and excelling in her role as an educator and team player. Prior to joining Linden schools, Koledo worked as a pharmaceutical sales representative. She now sees herself with a new challenge where she can continue within a team environment. “Working with nonprofit organizations and completing sales and marketing projects is an absolute dream job description. It was a natural fit for me; combining all the past experiences I have had,” Koledo said. “Teaching has been a gift that I will miss dearly. The kids are the best part of every single day. I had so much fun, and I love all the connections that I had with them.” Bringing the same level of passion and excitement to her next position is her top priority. Koledo, who works closely with Advertising Director Pete Clinton and Brand Manager Emily Caswell, started in July and has hit the ground running visiting clients and helping prep for the two big community events ahead. “We were fortunate to have met Bridget when she volunteered at our craft beer event last fall,” said View Newspaper Group Publisher Wes Smith. “Thanks to her positive energy and desire to get it right, we knew she’d be a great fit to our team. When we learned she may be interested in leaving her post with Linden schools we got to work creating a position that was the perfect fit for her skillset and our needs. We are thrilled to have Bridget as part of the View Newspaper Group family.” Outside of work, Koledo enjoys spending time with her husband Ed Koledo, executive director of Southern Lakes Parks & Recreation and their two sons. The family spends many hours doing outside activities such as boating and fishing, and working on local events together as a family. “Our boys have spent many hours with us in our community involvement with my past teaching and Ed’s work here in the local area. It’s in the family genes and I expect that will continue in this new avenue,” Koledo said. “I’m excited to be here and eager to help local businesses and nonprofits excel.” View Newspaper Group is a locally owned, locally connected news organization committed to making meaningful connections between readers, clients and their communities. With a print-first philosophy, View focuses on the growth and strength of each of their 14 locally owned community newspapers while continuing to look for new ways to expand.

Peter Meijer, R-Grand Rapids, mingles with supporters during his primary election watch party at the Social House Kitchen and Bar in downtown Grand Rapids on Tuesday, Aug. 2, 2022. John Gibbs is challenging Meijer in the Republican primary for the 3rd Congressional District. (Cory Morse | MLive.com) Cory Morse | MLive.com GRAND RAPIDS, MI — After winning election in 2020, Republican U.S. Rep. Peter Meijer went to Washington eager to promote conservative principles such as limited government and economic freedom, and to find ways to boost bipartisanship. But Meijer, R-Grand Rapids Township, whose time in office is now coming to a close, soon found himself facing a situation he never could have predicted. Rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, and Meijer joined nine other House Republicans in voting to impeach former President Donald Trump for inciting the insurrection. Ultimately, it was a vote that cost Meijer his job. “At the end of the day, if I had a nickel for every Republican colleague who said I totally agree with you, I wish I could have cast the vote but it would be too politically difficult, I would have a lot of nickels,” said Meijer, who was defeated 52% to 48% in the August Republican primary by Trump-endorsed candidate John Gibbs. Gibbs, who targeted Meijer because of his impeachment vote, lost to Democrat Hillary Scholten 55% to 42% in the November general election. She’s the first Democrat elected to represent Grand Rapids in Congress since 1974. During an interview, Meijer, an Iraq war veteran whose family founded the Meijer grocery store chain, reflected on his time in Congress. He spoke about his victories, his regrets, as well as the Jan. 6 insurrection and his vote to impeach Trump. “It was certainly the honor of a lifetime to be able to represent my hometown in Congress, and to fill some pretty big shoes,” said Meijer, referring to his past Republican congressmen who held the seat, including former President Gerald Ford, Paul Henry and Vern Ehlers. Moving forward, Meijer said he’s still planning his next steps. But he will remain in West Michigan and will be looking for new ways to serve the community and advance the policies and priorities he values. He also said he’s not ruling out another run for office. “My goal in running for office was to serve, and that goal has not changed,” he said. “The capacity in which I’m serving might.” He added, “I’m going to continue to stay engaged on moving a lot of the issues we were working on at the federal level. But also, I really saw the limitations of what the federal government can do when it comes to addressing a lot of the issues most top of mind to folks in West Michigan.” While Meijer, 34, drew the most headlines for his impeachment vote, he said he was proud of what he accomplished in office. The East Grand Rapids Public Schools graduate said four of his bills were signed into law. That’s double the previous record of two bills from a freshman congressman, he said. His bills included efforts to increase awareness of human trafficking, create a national supply chain database, and establish a Department of Homeland Security trade and economic security council, he said. They also include a commission to modernize and strengthen the State Department. “I think it’s easy to make it look like you’re doing something if you’re dropping a lot of pieces of legislation,” Meijer said. “But if those bills are going nowhere and you’re not putting in the hard work to get it across the finish line, you’re not moving the needle, you’re just wasting oxygen.” Other achievements included securing $7.2 million to help connect hundreds of homes in a Cascade Township neighborhood, whose wells were polluted by PFAS, to municipal water.

The idea behind the ads was to promote Gibbs because he was seen as an easier candidate for Scholten to beat in the November general election. “I really think it was,” Meijer said when asked if the DCCC was one of the factors that helped Gibbs defeat Meijer in the primary. “Gibbs wasn’t able to afford a single TV ad, and he needed it.” Reflecting on his loss and the state of the GOP, Meijer said the Republican party needs to reevaluate its strategy and the candidates it’s putting up for election, given how poorly the party performed in the 2022 mid-term election, he said. Democrats swept the statewide offices and won control of the state House and Senate. “With the exception of some countywide officials, come Jan. 3 at noon I won’t be represented by a single Republican in any legislative capacity,” Meijer said. “That’s pretty depressing. That should be a time for the party here in Michigan to take stock, see what went wrong.” In his final days in office, one of Meijer’s priorities was the passage of the Afghan Adjustment Act. Meijer, a frequent and vocal critic of the Biden administration’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, said the act was important because it would have provided Afghans evacuated from their country a pathway to apply for permanent residency in the U.S. Ultimately, the Senate did not include the act in a final, year-end spending package. “The fact that we weren’t able to get this done is incredibly disappointing,” said Meijer, who spoke about the need to pass the legislation in his final speech from the House floor. “It’s an insult on top of the moral injury and shame that was the catastrophic withdrawal.” With his time in office coming to an end, Meijer, of Grand Rapids Township, is back in West Michigan — and he says he intends to stay here. “West Michigan is my home,” he said. “It cracks me up. There are people who are like ‘Are you going to stay in D.C.? Why? I rented an apartment here while I was a member. West Michigan is home.” Read more: Grand Rapids business district awarded state grant Historic Flat Iron building in Grand Rapids sold to Cleveland firm for $9.75M 57-unit market rate apartment building planned for downtown Grand Rapids If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

a graduation ceremony in Corunna on Tuesday evening, Aug. 23. Sheriff Brian BeGole and Emergency Manager Jeff Weiss joined the 23 graduates. The new SAR team will assist the Shiawassee County Sheriff’s Office and other first responders in seeking missing/absent person(s) such as they recently did at the Shiawassee County Fair. The team is a multi-disciplinary organization comprised solely of volunteers. (Independent Photo/Karen Mead-Elford) The Shiawassee County Sheriff’s Office held a graduation ceremony for the newly formed Shiawassee County Search and Rescue team (SAR) on Tuesday, Aug. 23 at the Corunna Community Center. Twenty-three individuals successfully passed the training to become certified members of the new group. Event speakers included Shiawassee County Emergency Manager Jeff Weiss, Shiawassee County Sheriff Brian BeGole, Sheriff’s Office Chaplain Todd Evans and SAR Team Commander Mike Johns. Family members and friends attended to support the graduates for the ceremony. The SAR Team is composed entirely of volunteers in service to the Shiawassee County community and neighboring areas. The group is overseen by the Shiawassee County Sheriff’s Office. The first graduating class included the following team members: Gregory Barber, Jerald Bila, Christopher Campbell, Travis DeVoe, Katie Dodge, Jennifer Drummond, Dale Franks, Heather Griffin, Michael Johns, Heidi Lewicki, Thomas McCardell, Carolyn Reneaud, Debi Ritter, Scott Ritter, Robert Schultz Jr., Melissa Sellers, Eric Stechschulte, Douglas Svarc, Ashlea Sweatman, Perry Thompson, Linda Thorsby, Paul Wilde and Willie Wilson. “I’m extremely proud of the search and rescue volunteers that come in on a monthly basis, put their heart into it, put their time into it and put their money into it,” Weiss stated early in the ceremony. He offered the team had started out with 44 initial applicants, but following a background check, that number came down to 42, with 23 successfully graduating. Weiss announced two more had been approved just that day to start the training. “Tonight is a great night,” BeGole stated to attendees. “We get to celebrate your achievement in completing the search and rescue training and the milestone of having the Sheriff’s Office first search and rescue team.” Later, BeGole emphasized that Shiawassee is a great place to live and an even greater place to serve, expressing his gratitude to the graduates and their families for all of the commitment and support in developing the team. The SAR mission statement focuses on providing a “well-trained, professional team of volunteers who are prepared to respond rapidly, effectively and safely to serve as an additional resource to the Shiawassee County Sheriff’s Office in search and rescue of lost, missing and overdue persons.” Going forward, SAR team members will also offer support to first responders if needed. Basic requirements include being at least 18, passing a background check and future annual checks, successfully completing the training, volunteering minus expectation of pay/recognition, attending mandatory meetings and more. SAR Team Commander Mike Johns stated it took over 1,000 hours each in just basic training for the team. Johns also shared some recent stories related to SAR volunteers who had worked at the Shiawassee County Fair as part of the training. Three missing person scenarios were quickly and happily resolved at the fairgrounds due to SAR volunteers. Over 380 hours were contributed by SAR volunteers during the fair. After each graduate received a certificate and had a photo with BeGole, refreshments and cake were served. If interested in finding out more about the SAR team or becoming a team member, please contact Emergency Manager/Dept. of Homeland Security Jeff Weiss at (989) 743-3411 ext. 2620 or at jweiss@shiawassee.net.'}]"

Stoltman, who started a week ago, previously was town manager in Kremmling, Colorado. (Betsy Bloom/Daily News photo) NORWAY — The city of Norway is under new management. Ray Anderson officially retired Friday after 22 1/2 years with Norway’s city government, the past 21 as city manager. His successor, Dan Stoltman, had his first day on the job Monday. Anderson had intended to retire in October but an initial search failed to find his replacement, so he stayed on while a second round was conducted. The city hired Stoltman, then town manager in Kremmling, Colorado, in February. The 56-year-old Anderson said the time was right to step away from the job, noting his father died at age 55 so never got to enjoy retirement. “I just wanted to stay flexible,” Anderson said. He intends to do some consulting, he said, “take my experience in project management, policy — there’s several different areas where I can help out.” Anderson started with the city in 1999 as director of the Norway Department of Power and Light, the community’s not-for-profit electric utility, then advanced to administrator 1 1/2 years later. Before that, the 1989 Michigan Technological University graduate worked on refinery shutdowns at Chicago Bridge & Iron Company. Born and raised in Norway, Anderson said he will remain in the community with his wife, Andrea. They have two daughters: Christina, 23, like her dad an MTU graduate, now working for the Target Corp. in Minneapolis; and Anna, 21, enrolled in the arts program at the University of Michigan. He also will remain available to his successor, who didn’t reach Norway until April 18. Stoltman arrived about 4:30 p.m. after 1,300 miles on the road and by 7 p.m. was attending his first city council meeting. A native of Milford, Michigan, the 40-year-old Stoltman was town manager in Kremmling, a community west of Boulder, Colo., for three years. But he previously had been assistant city manager for four years in Washburn, Wis., in Bayfield County on Lake Superior. Norway was an opportunity to be closer to family downstate and to friends they made in northern Wisconsin. The Upper Peninsula also offered the kind of country he and his girlfriend prefer, Stoltman said. “It was a positive move for me,” he said. He earned his undergraduate degree at Oakland University and then a master’s degree at Eastern Michigan University. His initial impression of Norway is “it’s been great so far, welcoming … the community seems really solid, well planned.” He said he looks forward to learning about the community and finding a house in Norway.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Meet Alice Wong. She’s the founder and director of the Disability Visibility Project, an online creative space for promoting and sharing disability media, as well as the editorial mind behind the 2020 essay collection Disability Visibility: First-Person Stories from the Twenty-First Century (which has since been adapted for young adults). Wong’s writings on disability justice have also been published in countless publications, including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and Radiolab, among others. “She’s not just talking the talk,” says fellow author Stephanie Foo (more on her in a bit!). “She’s so community-oriented and so about lifting all of us up.” But while Wong elected to write—in fact, her favorite space at school was the library—the advocacy part chose her. She explains, “I’m an activist whether I wanted to be or not, because I am a disabled person born into a non-disabled world.” Obtaining the tools to engage in that activism, though, often means breaking a few conventions, especially since Wong finds most traditional forms of activism inaccessible. “So,” she says, “I made it my own.” This is where her debut memoir, Year of the Tiger, enters the frame. Born in the wake of Wong’s preceding anthology (2020’s Disability Visibility), the book aims to accelerate that movement’s momentum. Coincidentally, 2022 would also be Wong’s year—like the year she was born (1974), it was also a Chinese Year of the Tiger. Add a little pandemic-stoked urgency and future uncertainty to the fire, and she had the perfect publication storm. “Reflecting on what I’d done,” she says, “the title came to me for a memoir.” Wong, however, was resolute in telling that story on her own terms. “Many memoirs bore me and seem very self-aggrandizing,” she says. “I wanted to show people what I’ve done instead of telling [them about] my life.” To do this, she chose to layer her book with a selection of mixed media—including commissioned artwork, podcasts, and even a few SMS clips—interspersed with her past publications, ranging from funny to slightly profane. Telling the StoryYear of the Tiger will be the subject of an upcoming event with the National Writers Series, though due to health concerns, Wong is not able to appear. Stephanie Foo, journalist and acclaimed author of What My Bones Know: A Memoir of Healing from Complex Trauma, will be speaking on Wong’s behalf. For Foo, the book’s multi-sensory narrative—and the landscape of Wong’s lived experience—opens the door for real conversation. “The format of the book is really [important],” she says, “because it embodies the message that we can break the rules to create a world that’s accessible to disabled folks.” She adds that the book was also gloriously bereft of the pity society often pins on the disabled community. “[Wong’s work] sort of shatters that view of, ‘look at how courageous this person is to be disabled and merely surviving,’” Foo explains. Instead, both she and Wong promote a more nuanced take on disability, one that confronts limitations while still celebrating the fullness of life. In doing so, they’re destroying the ableist narrative and replacing it with one of inclusivity that extends to marginalized folks of all stripes. “Stories shape how we see ourselves. That’s why it’s so important that books like [Wong’s] are out there,” says Foo. “They’re critical to our zeitgeist.” Foo’s own memoir, What My Bones Know, details her complex-PTSD diagnosis (that’s a disorder caused by long-term trauma) and the subsequent journey to both understand and heal from her condition. Her early search for literature, though, yielded only clinical accounts. “I wanted to immerse myself in a first-person narrative on c-PTSD, and I didn’t see any [books] that described the experience of possessing it,” she says. So Foo set out to write one herself. It’s in this realm of reframing those ideals that Wong’s work intersects with hers. “I really wanted to create something that was, [like Year of the Tiger], a little outrageous, a little funny,” she notes. “[Celebration] isn’t something we see enough in the disabled narrative. Of all the books I had read, the [attitude] surrounding c-PTSD was one of being broken inside. And I was like, that cannot be the only way we see ourselves.” Listening and LearningHow can folks better support those within that community? Both Wong and Foo agree that literature is a great place to start. “We are in a time where there is a wealth of disabled wisdom in print. Educate yourself and get politicized,” says Wong. She says this is not only to show support for those authors, but also to avoid the embarrassing error of making an incorrect assumption. Foo explains, “Often a mistake that people make is trying to give [disabled] people what they think they need,” when, regardless of how well-intended the gesture, “that is not what we need at all.” Consequently, the development of equitable infrastructure is an equally-important goal, and Foo says reshaping our understanding of “normal” is critical to creating them. No two human experiences are the same, and what might feel effortless to one person could be the keystone to survival for another. To put the concept in perspective, Foo invites readers to consider the kind of impact an exceptional condition might have on something as basic as going to work. “For example, I don’t know that I’ll ever have a job again that I have to go into an office for,” she says, “so, having employers that understand and can work around that is really key.” Those accommodations, however, are not always met, thanks in large part to injustices ingrained in our labor laws. When that happens, Foo says, “You have to figure out how to fill those holes. You’re really just fighting for yourself.” When a system fails one person, though, it fails everyone involved. This is where writers like Foo and Wong, whose work aims to fill a societal void, inherently carry an activist torch. “You see the holes that people fall through because you’ve fallen through them yourself,” Foo explains. “You also have to fight for everyone else.” About the EventThis virtual event takes place at 7pm on Thursday, December 8, and will feature a conversation with Stephanie Foo on behalf of Alice Wong.

Cinemas building once stood on Court Street between Belsay and Genesee roads. Ric Rubio, representing Serra Works of Court Street, owner of the former Showcase Cinemas property at 5205 E. Court St., went before the zoning board of appeals June 16 to request a temporary zoning variance. Leandra Swayne, Burton building official, said Serra Automotive was asking for the variance to park GM cars, trucks and SUVs while they awaited semiconductor chips. The front of the property is zoned C-2 in and is zoned M-1 in the very back of the property, she said. She said Rubio asked for a temporary use of this property and recommended the zoning board add a stipulation for an expiration date – 12 months, starting June 21. “I think that’s a good idea to have a date nailed down for him, so our city doesn’t end up being a parking lot,” said Swayne. “We do know the concern with the parking for the new vehicles.” She said there will also be a five sections of 50-foot-by-5-foot-high chain link fence placed in the front of the property, but she suggested the board could call for six-foot tall fencing. Rubio said GM is consolidating smaller lots into one lot while it develops a lot closer to the assembly plant but predicted it would take about one year to do so. “So, we have to look for some additional parking (until then),” he said. “There will be 24-hour security on site. We have quite a bit of inventory of vehicles.” He said the fence will not go all the way around the property, just along the front. “To fence the entire perimeter for a year is kind of costly and labor intense so it will be secured by multiple security guards,” said Rubio. “There will be temporary lighting in the back.” The lighting will be solar powered, so no generators will be used, said Rubio. Board member Vaughn Smith asked how they would be handling security onsite, to which Rubio replied saying security would be spread around the property and would be mobile. Smith said he was concerned about nearby homes, along Schafer, Arnold and Clairwood drives on the opposite side of the railroad tracks, which back up to the Showcase property. “There’s a lot of traffic in that area. I don’t open up that area and people’s homes to those coming to look at the cars,” he said. “I just want to make sure there is a situation of control where people are not going into that area, looking at the cars and finding other things to do.” Rubio said it is intriguing to people to see that many cars in one location, but he said he thinks once the novelty wears off it will no longer cause distractions. He also reaffirmed there will only be vehicles stored on the site, no customers will be allowed there. “They’re just waiting there for chips,” said Rubio. Board member Scott Hynes asked why the fence needed to be removed after the cars were gone. “Right now, it’s kind of an eyesore,” said board member Scott Hynes. “The fence would be kind of a nice cover.” Swayne agreed, but said she doesn’t want a developer to come along and want to utilize the fence as part of a future project or development at the site. Board member Michaeline Ward-Terry made a motion to allow the parking of cars at the site from June 21, 2022-June 21, 2023. She said the fence should be six-foot tall and be removed when no longer in use. Also, the motion required all solar-powered lighting and security discussed at the meeting to be implemented with a fence in front with security on all sides, to be removed after the storage of cars was complete next year.

State and local leaders who worked to boost jobs and this business’s local footprint should be commended. But the article seems a puff-piece press release, woefully deficient in journalistic mettle as a business or news story, let alone the front page’s lead item. This probably isn’t The Monroe News’ fault. The paper’s owner likely dictated what to run. But that doesn’t mean it’s good journalism. The story calls the building “historic,” but lacks detail on its age, data easily available in the paper’s own “morgue” (library), the county historical museum, Ellis library or city hall. For a paper that runs freelance history pieces every day, the absence is stunning. Newspapers have been published at 20 W. First St. for more than 100 years, from at least the days of the Monroe Democrat to its 1918 successor, The Monroe Evening News, to today’s iteration. The newspaper you are reading is a direct descendant of the Michigan Sentinel, first published by Edward Ellis in 1825. That makes Monroe’s paper the state’s second oldest, a business older than Michigan. Worse, Gannett is never identified as the newspaper’s owner. The reason for the sale is shielded. Nationwide, Gannett has jettisoned jobs and the legacy buildings that house its hollowed-out staffs while executives rake in hefty bonuses. The sale price — an important public record since $600,000 in taxpayer dollars are being used to help fund 360 Digilab’s purchase — is missing too. Are any proceeds going to The Monroe News’ operation? Doubtful. It’s rich for Gannett to take taxpayer dollars when its business model calls for its hundreds of dailies and weeklies nationwide to be watchdogs of such money. The sale, although a plus for Monroe in many respects, shows Gannett mimicking the venture-capital conglomerates that have taken over — and closed — hundreds of small-town newspapers. For these companies, only their shareholders matter, not the communities they serve. They gut staff, decimate coverage, and weaken democracy, until profits are bled dry. Then they shut the paper. Local journalism be damned! The way Gannett is operating, the only evidence of The Monroe News’ place in the community soon will be the historical marker outside. The loss will not be Gannett’s.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 6:08 pm Wayne State’s American Institute of Graphic Arts student chapter hosted its first free printmaking workshop “Pizza and Printmaking” for WSU students in Old Main Monday night. The workshop aimed to provide students from different fields of study the opportunity to experience graphic design, AIGA organizer Anna Boyer said. Boyer said the interests of the students influenced the creation of the workshop. “Our group discussed with people who are student members of the organization, asking them what things they would like to see and do and we also based this off of our own interests,” Boyer said. The workshop focused on the block printing process, which creates designs by stamping a rubber block on a blank canvas. Boyer taught students how to use a carving tool to scrape a design into a soft rubber block, then coat the block in ink with a paint roller and press it onto a sheet of paper to transfer the ink onto the canvas. This process resulted in various monochromatic designs created by the printed ink from the stamps students designed during the workshop. Graphic design major Josie Curtis said she enjoys the block printing process. “I actually really love doing this, but I haven’t done it in a while,” she said. Curtis said she has experience with the block printing process from making pieces for the annual Plymouth Art in the Park festival. Curtis said her biggest inspiration for graphic design came from her aunts who are both graphic designers. During the Monday workshop, Curtis designed two prints, one being a teapot stack and another with abstract fine-line swirls and patterns. Curtis said she chose a graphic design career because it can utilize fine arts and marketing, which she plans to use through designing for nonprofit organizations in the future. “One thing I’ve learned about graphic design is that it’s more about people than I ever thought it was going to be about,” Curtis said. Graphic design major Hyelim Shin said she was interested in this workshop because she wanted to meet other like-minded students. “It’s so hard to meet people at Wayne State and I’ve never really met people in my major besides in my classes and it’s always fun to get involved with stuff on campus other than class,” Shin said. “I’ve done wood carving before so I’m thinking it’ll probably be a little easier since the material is more malleable,” said Shin. Regardless, she wanted to stick to doing something simple, as to not overestimate the potential difficulty. Boyer said the Dean of Students Office was supportive of the new workshop. “We helped plan this through the Dean of Students Office, so they helped provide some funding for the event and then we designed the fliers and advertising for it,” Boyer said. At the end of the workshop, attendees traded their prints with each other in an art swap. “I actually had so much fun,” Shin said, “I think I’m going to try doing this on my own at home now.” Emily Crane is a contributing writer for The South End.

about the free trade of bullets as they are about gun sales. Take, for instance, the Uvalde, Texas, shooting that killed 19 school children and their two teachers. The gunman in the 2022 assault armed himself with more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition after spending about $5,000 on guns, bullets and gear. He fired 142 rounds inside the school, starting in a fourth grade classroom. He had enough bullets to do a lot more damage. Time and time again, in the wake of a mass shooting it’s revealed that the shooter was carrying enough weaponry to kill everyone inside a school, movie theater, grocery store or even a full-sized mall. It\'s not hard for the killers to build a significant arsenal of assault rifles, handguns, high-capacity magazines – and bullets. Lots of bullets. Each year billions of bullets are sold in the U.S., making bullet sales a booming business. A recent trade report estimated the global small-caliber ammunition market is expected to reach $11.3 billion by 2030. And gun sales have ramped up, hitting buying highs even during pandemic-related ammunition shortages. Even then, the U.S. government and munitions manufacturers have reported increased sales and higher prices by resellers as buyers stockpiled bullets and guns. After a mass shooting, public attention inevitably turns to a debate on the control of guns. But with shooters so often stocked up on ammunition to kill as many as possible, many are left to wonder: What about the bullets? ""Ammunition plays a large role in mass shootings, and ammunition has been historically less regulated than firearms themselves,"" said New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, a Democrat who oversees a newly established office designed to sue gun and ammunition manufacturers when their products cause harm. WHERE DO SHOOTERS GET THEIR WEAPONS? More mass shooters are using semi-automatic rifles – often bought legally It’s remarkably easy for anyone to obtain large quantities of ammunition, said Ari Freilich, state policy director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, led by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a mass shooting in 2011. In most places in the country, people can go online and have hundreds or thousands of bullets delivered to their door “as if ordering a pizza,” he said. California’s ammunition regulations are some of the most comprehensive, Freilich said, noting the requirement that a background check be completed at the point of sale and that ammunition can’t be ordered online and shipped to your door; it can be picked up from an authorized dealer that must perform the background check. “Restricting large-capacity magazines is one of the single most effective things we could do to reduce the shooter\'s capacity to turn shootings into mass murders,” Freilich said. Proponents say lower capacities on magazines would force an attacker to stop to reload a weapon sooner and more often, providing more opportunity for people to either subdue the shooter or escape. Freilich noted that when Giffords was shot, bystanders used an opportune moment when the shooter was reloading his weapon to subdue him and end the attack. It\'s a restriction favored by most of the American public. A Gallup poll in June found 55% support banning the sale and possession of magazines with capacities higher than 10 rounds, 44% oppose it and 1% had no opinion. The Giffords group and other gun regulation advocates also propose that ammunition sellers be required to maintain records of their sales and make the information available to law enforcement, as New Jersey will soon enact. Data collection and reporting of large sales to state police, along with other measures such as behavioral threat assessments, will help law enforcement to identify bad actors, said Platkin, the New Jersey attorney general. Law-abiding gun owners who purchase ammunition in bulk won’t have anything to worry about, Platkin said. A spokesperson for the NRA said that flagging bulk purchases of ammunition as suspicious is misguided and based on misconceptions about firearms and ammunition. “Gun owners who shoot often will regularly purchase thousands of rounds of ammunition per transaction. Purchases of this nature happen daily. Some law-abiding gun owners may use hundreds of rounds of ammunition simply practicing at the range,” the NRA’s Amy Hunter said. “Competitive shooters will easily go through a thousand rounds, or more, of ammunition in a single day. And, just like any consumer, gun owners often stock up when they see a good buy.” But Platkin said: “Nothing that we have done has taken away or intends to take away people\'s lawful right to possess firearms and possess legal ammunition. What we\'re trying to do is keep folks safe.” Some states and federal law have requirements for purchasing or possessing ammunition, such as age requirements or a prohibition for people with certain criminal convictions. But in many places, anyone can go online or walk into a store and buy ammunition unchecked, because federal law doesn\'t require sellers to perform background checks to determine whether purchasers are banned from having ammunition. Government leaders calling for reform say bullet regulation – including through the recording of sales, licensing of dealers or background checks – is necessary in the battle to curb mass shootings. “Gun violence is an epidemic, and if we\'re going to respond to it, there\'s not one measure that\'s going to cure it, the same way there\'s not one effort that was going to cure COVID-19. You have to treat it like the public health crisis that it is and attack it from many angles,” Platkin said. A handful of states have some ammunition regulations, including California\'s point-of-sale background check requirement and New York\'s record-keeping requirements. Some states ban types of dangerous ammunition, such as the eight states that ban ammunition that explodes on contact, according to the Giffords group. Federally, only certain armor-piercing bullets are banned except for law enforcement. Opponents of regulation like the National Rifle Association, which also largely opposes firearm regulations, argue that ammunition is protected under the 2nd Amendment as an essential component of bearable arms. Though the Supreme Court hasn\'t directly weighed in on ammunition regulations, experts say courts would interpret the 2nd Amendment to include protections for people to have ammunition, and Freilich noted regulations being proposed on ammunition are ""really pretty modest."" Sandy Hook to Uvalde: Congress has proposed gun control laws. Only one has passed. What to know: The Supreme Court made a monumental ruling on gun rights Recent legislation and voter measures have sought to fill gaps in some states. In Oregon, voters narrowly passed a ballot measure in November to enact new gun control law, including a provision that would prohibit high-capacity magazines. Oregon’s Measure 114, which was approved by 50.6% of voters – 49.4% opposed – was put on hold by a judge Dec. 15 while gun rights groups challenge its constitutionality in court. Proponents of the provision banning magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, with some exceptions, argue it could be a key factor in limiting the amount of death and injury in mass shootings. Harney County, Oregon, Judge Robert Raschio called it “speculation” that the measure would promote public safety in his decision to halt the law from taking effect. “Banning magazines over 10 rounds is no more likely to reduce criminal abuse of guns then banning high horsepower engines is likely to reduce criminal abuse of automobiles,” the lawsuit brought by a gun rights group, a sheriff and a gun store owner in Oregon said. “To the contrary, the only thing the ban contained in 114 ensures is that a criminal unlawfully carrying a firearm with a magazine over 10 rounds will have a potentially devastating advantage over his law-abiding victim.” State-level gun control: 5 states that changed their laws after mass shootings Colorado has had a similar law on the books since 2013 in the wake of the Aurora movie theater massacre that killed 12 people and injured dozens more. That law bans the sale of magazines with a capacity for over 15 rounds, and it has faced legal challenges. Still, loopholes in that law made it possible for a man who killed 10 in a Colorado supermarket last year to have legally obtained high-capacity magazines on him. Eleven other states and Washington, D.C., have banned large-capacity magazines: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. Four of the 13 states with laws only enacted them in 2022, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. In many cases, because there aren’t requirements in many states or federally for ammunition sellers to keep records of the sales – unlike with gun sales – the origin of mass amounts of ammunition can’t be easily traced. In large part, gun and ammunition manufacturers and sellers are shielded from liability by the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. It gives broad immunity to the industry in the wake of “the criminal or unlawful misuse” of a firearm. It makes'}]"
