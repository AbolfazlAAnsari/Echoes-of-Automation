(John Shinskie photo) It seems no matter how much space I have ... I run out of space. Squeezing what I want to say, or know, onto one page, even when I’m only writing one or two stories, gets difficult. Especially when I’m writing about something I’m excited about. Like the — now — four-part series on the 1989 West Perry football team. I interviewed Bob Anderson for over 90 minutes, talked to Bob Boden, Roger Austin, Craig May and Rod Frisco to flesh out details, read copies of previews and gamers that were published in the Patriot-News and studied game and season stats. Those Mustangs really were a remarkable collection of athletes, who had a remarkable, if ultimately disappointing, year. In the first installment, I tried to draw the big picture of what that team was and what it accomplished. In the next two, I tried to capture the essence of its week-in, week-out excellence. This week, I’m cleaning my notebook of the leftover anecdotes that didn’t quite fit with the story or space I had. Can’t stop now Over 10 weeks, the Mustangs stayed focused on their goals; going undefeated, winning the program’s first Mid-Penn division championship and making the District 3 playoffs for the first time in school history. Anderson explained, several times, his players were single-minded in pursuit of those goals, never looking ahead, always disciplined in their preparation, whether in film study, practice or pregame warm-up. Then, the Monday after it was official that the Mustangs’ bid for a postseason had failed, that their season was over, Anderson went to the locker room for a final meeting. As Anderson remembered, “I’ll never forget that I went in and saw they were all in pads, they wanted one more practice together. So that’s what they did — they went out and practiced. “That’s another reason why I loved that group of kids.” Big finish Denied their opportunity to play in districts, 11 of Anderson’s seniors were selected to play in the MPC East-West Thanksgiving all-star game at West Shore Stadium. According to Frisco’s coverage, the Mustangs — and a couple of Susquenita players — were instrumental in the West’s 21-6 win. In two inches of snow, Shawn Kirk kicked a 36-yard field goal for the only score of the first half. Jason Prowell rushed for game-high 58 yards and a touchdown on 12 carries. QB Brent Morrow made the best of his four completions by ringing up 151 yards including TD tosses of 84 and 49 yards. Boden, Mat Reisinger, Mike Ritter, Aaron Wright and tight end Ryan Stouffer formed the nucleus of the West’s offensive line. Scott Morrison, Matt Bender and Kevin Penn were key pieces on a defense, which included Blackhawks Derek Little (three interceptions), Dave Cook (one pick) and lineman Jason Delp that limited the East to 147 yards of offense. Brains and talent In every conversation with Anderson, Austin or May, the intelligence, football and otherwise, of the Mustang athletes, was pointed to as a source of their success. So many of those players put that intelligence to good use in building their professional careers. Morrow, who accepted a nomination to West Point, and his backup Kyle Murray, who graduated from the Naval Academy, have, in Anderson’s words, “gone all over the world serving their country.” Four members of that team played NCAA Division II football. Boden played four years at East Stroudsburg, Stouffer was with him for three of those years. Wright played three years at Bloomsburg and Matt Goodling (Slippery Rock) also spent three years playing PSAC football before blowing out his knee. Boden and Wright were volunteer assistants on Anderson’s staff in 1995-1996, then went full time in 1997. Boden worked as an assistant on Al Ream’s staff, until taking the head job in 2014. After starting his career with 26 straight losses, Boden has gone 18-14 over the last three years and led the Mustangs to a first-round D-3 win over West York in 2018. Wright eventually moved on to the head job at Millersburg. “Two head coaches, two kids with long careers in the military and Morrison is an attorney. That team was filled with special kids, solid citizens,” Anderson said. “It makes you proud how that group has made such positive contributions.” T.J. Quaker (right) was in middle school, idolizing the 1989 team. Today, he's a coach. (John Shinskie photo) Be like Chad T.J. Quaker was in eighth grade, playing middle school football in 1989. Chad Clark was his hero. “I looked up to Chad. I revered him,” Quaker explained. “It’s because of him I wanted to be a receiver and a hurdler. I wore his number.” Quaker, now Boden’s offensive coordinator, has gone on to have a nice run with the Mustangs. In 1993, his senior year, he caught 40 passes for 640 yards and five touchdowns. At the time, he was second to Clark (43 catches) on the school’s all-time list. He is currently tied for ninth. Quaker has been passed by a handful of kids that he mentored, either as offensive coordinator or receiver’s coach. The list — by receptions — (courtesy of Deven Whitfield) includes Terrance Quaker (T-1 with 58 catches in 2017, Chase May (T-1, 58, 2013), Kevin Kindig (T-3, 56, 2014), Keeghan Morrison (T-3, 56, 2011), Cameron May (No. 5, 51, 2016) and Chase May (T-6 with Clark, 43, 2012). No mas! In the run-up to the Susquehanna Township game, Indian D-tackle Jeff Nork was getting a lot of ink. The Mustangs needed to make the 6-6, 220 front-seven force a focus of their blocking schemes. It wasn’t a problem. As Boden recalled, “(guard) Mike Ritter trapped him twice and he went out of the game.” With Nork sidelined, West Perry’s feature back, Jason Prowell, exploded for what was at the time a school-record 179 yards, including 117 (on 11 carries) in the decisive second half. BOOOOOOOO!!! Frisco, who covered high school football for the Patriot-News, remembers the Mustangs game at Camp Hill very well. Frisco not only covered the game, he gazed into his crystal ball and picked ... the Lions to win the game. West Perry thrashed Camp Hill 57-0. “As I was walking to my car after the game, West Perry’s bus went by,” Frisco explained. “Let’s just say I was serenaded.” To his credit, Frisco never bought into the ‘West Perry didn’t play anybody’ meme. He said, “You could say that about every team. In any league or division, half the teams are good and half aren’t. West Perry beat everybody on its schedule — and handily. That’s all you can do. Like I said earlier, they were really good.” Records set in 1989 (Current records in parenthesis) Single season Jason Prowell Rushing yards 1,286 (2,042 Musa Smith) Jason Prowell Rushing TDs 18 (32 Musa Smith) Jason Prowell Total TDs 20 (32 Musa Smith) Brent Morrow TD passes 18 (24 Zach Smith) Brent Morrow Completion % 55.8 (57.3 Trey Little) Shawn Kirk Field goals 7 (7 Shawn Kirk) Shawn Kirk Point-after kicks 38 (65 Wes Portzline) Shawn Kirk Kicking points 59 (74 Wes Portzline) Chad Clark Receptions 40 (58 Chase May, Terrance Quaker) Chad Clark Receiving yards 761 (1,008 Kevin Kindig) Chad Clark TD receptions 12 (12 Chad Clark) Career Jason Prowell Rushing TDs 24 (56 Kenyon Johnson) Jason Prowell Total TDs 26 (63 Kenyon Johnson) Shawn Kirk Field goals 9 (11 Jonah Quick) Shawn Kirk Point-after kicks 54 (126 Wes Portzline) Shawn Kirk Kicking points 81 (156 Wes Portzline) If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Slight chance of a rain shower. Low around 60F. Winds light and variable. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 4:41 am Connecting the Valley to Print and Digital Publisher Amy Moyer and Editor Chris Brady meet throughout the week to discuss projects at The Standard-Journal. The two combined have over 50 years experience in the newspaper industry. MILTON — Change in any business, or industry, is inevitable. Change in the newspaper industry has long been fast and furious. From the typewriter to state-of-the-art printing presses, to change brought on by government action and inaction — such as recent tariffs — newspaper publishers and staffs have to remain vigilent to provide the communities they serve with the news they can use. “Yes, the newspaper industry has changed over the last 30 years and as our industry changed, so did we,” said Amy Moyer, Standard-Journal publisher since 1996. “Since the early 1990s we have evolved in to a multi-media company and we provide a wide array of services for our local businesses. We found companies were coming in from other states to sell advertising in our markets and we decided we could produce these projects as well. Restaurant menus, placemats and sports posters are a few examples.” This ad unit is new and hasn't been set up yet for your publication. Contact support@empowerlocal.com and we'll get the item set up. In addition to the daily newspaper, published six days a week in Milton, The Standard-Journal publishes dozens of pieces throughout the year, from the popular Relocation Guide to showcases featuring some of our larger communities. There’s also magazine publications featuring local counties, as well as books and booklets featuring a variety of topics. The “Honoring Valley Veterans” series has been featured in books released in each of the last four years, and another is being planned. “Some of our most-read publications are done throughout the year,” said Moyer. “Our editorial and sales staffs have done a great job at creating one-of-a-kind pieces. This past year we produced our annual football program that is well received in the 18 local schools in the (Pa.) heartland (athletic) conference. We produced a stadium blanket that we give to the cheerleaders in those 18 school districts to throw out at football games. We like to do projects that are fun, benefit our advertisers and serve a purpose in our local communities. We literally have 12 or more special publications or projects on our sales calendar every month. We want our readers to shop local and to support local businesses.” The Standard-Journal has long been a community-based entity, not just in terms of its publication, but also through service. “We partner with organizations and donate monies back to them from the sales we generate,” said Moyer. “Recently we donated $2,000 to The River Valley Senior Providers Group, a non profit that awards grants to its members that provide services to seniors and those with disabilities. We produced a veterans series and give back to the American Legions and VFWs.” Many of the publications that endure today were the first of their kind in the valley, and many have been imitated and duplicated by various other businesses and newspapers. “We were one of the first newspapers in the state to partner with chambers of commerce to begin membership guides and maps,” said Moyer. “In the 1990s we worked with Evangelical Community Hospital to print a quarterly publication, that they continue to print and distribute on their own to this day to promote health and wellness.” Chris Brady is managing editor at The Standard-Journal and can be reached at chris@standard-journal.com.

Kennedy's assassination. At this time, The Times Herald was an afternoon publication. The front page of The Times Herald on Tuesday, June 6, 1944. On that day 70 years ago, 156,000 troops from the allied countries including the United Kingdom and the United States joined forces to launch an audacious attack on the beaches of Normandy. The Extra edition of The Times Herald on Monday, Dec. 8, 1941. This undated Times Herald file photo shows the construction of the Matsonford Bridge in Conshohocken. The Times Herald “Montgomery County’s Newspaper” is a daily newspaper that for more than 200 years was based in Norristown. Now the building that housed it is to be no more. The paper is the descendant of the Norristown Gazette, which was first published in 1799 by David Sower. The name was changed to the “Norristown Herald and Weekly Advertiser” in its second year. With slight name configurations and various owners over the years it remained in operation until 1921. In 1881 Civil War veteran Captain William Rennyson of Bridgeport founded the Norristown Daily Times. In 1921, Ralph Beaver Strassburger bought the Norristown Daily Herald. In December Strassburger purchased the Norristown Daily Times. Immediately after he merged the two to create The Norristown Times Herald. He consolidated operations at 410 Markley Street where it remained for 98 years. Over the decades The Times Herald truly became “Montgomery County’s Home Town Newspaper”. In the early 1960s it dropped the “Norristown” from its banner to promote a more county-wide persona. Whereas the big city papers of Philadelphia, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Evening Bulletin, focused on city, national and international news The Times Herald was where you went to read of news in your community. Everywhere from Norristown to King of Prussia, from the Norritons to the far reaches of the county The Herald was there to relate to you the important, informative, interesting and entertaining news happening in your Montco backyard. Business: When the King of Prussia Industrial Park was first planned and slatted o open. Sports: For years it reported on the Thanksgiving rivalry between Upper Merion and Norristown High School football teams. Chief Halftown promoting bowling at the Brunswick Lanes. Fire: The day that Grants Department Store at the Valley Forge Shopping Center burned down. Entertainment: When The Plaza Theater featured a 70 millimeter wide screens. The opening of The King, The Queen and the Valley Forge movies theaters, IMAX at the Regal. Politics: John F. Kennedy staying at the George Washington Motor Lodge. Richard Nixon speaking at the Mall outside Wanemakers. Religion: The founding of Mother of Divine Providence church and subsequent establishment of M.D.P. School. The founding of Temple Brith Achim. Parks: The expansion of Valley Forge State Park and its assumption by the Federal government. The building of Heyser Park and purchase of Norview Farms. Shopping: The opening of the original King of Prussia Plaza, the addition of the Court, the renovation and merging of the two. I personally home delivered The Herald to customers throughout Brandywine Village. As did my older brother before me and younger brother after. With the advent of the internet and the changing way news is received and assimilated the operation and existence of a printed daily newspaper is not the same. And so The Times Herald building is to be no more. An orthodontist from Harleysville is planning to replace it with high rise apartments. The Herald will continue, printed, but largely online. An ethereal modern existence. Even now many of its newspaper vendor boxes that used to dot the streets of Upper Merion are gone. The one in front of the old Town Center Road US Post Office, another at the entrance to Brandywine Village have disappeared. The demolition of the Times Herald building is symbolic of our age. A thing is gone, but remains. Present, but unseen. Still vibrant and valued, but intangible. On the internet. Today The Times Herald strives to continue that “Home Town Newspaper” tradition. Not only within it pages, but with its management of content for The King of Prussia Courier, the weekly given free to all township residents. It would be nice to have something physical to hold onto. Something the public can see and touch. But the important thing is the story. The continuing story of the people of Montgomery County. Of Greater King of Prussia. As reported in their “Home Town Newspaper” The Times Herald.” Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group""}]"

North Carolina full federal recognition and access to millions of dollars in community benefits. The tribe has sought federal recognition for more than 130 years, and it received limited recognition from the federal government in 1956. The partial recognition has blocked the community, which has about 55,000 members and is headquartered in Pembroke in Southeastern North Carolina, from receiving benefits for education, health care and economic development that are available to other federally recognized tribes. The legislation also would allow the tribe to open a casino in Robeson County not far from Interstate 95 and I-74. This would bring jobs in one of the most impoverished areas of North Carolina and one that has been pummeled since the 1990s by factory closings that sent jobs overseas.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 4:44 am Rich Darrenkamp holds the hat he was chosen to receive during the Trump Thunder rally in Potter County Aug. 29. Local veteran Rick Darrenkamp was awarded a MAGA Hat signed by President Donald Trump on Saturday, Sept. 5. At the end of Trump Thunder in God’s Country, Potter County, a motorcycle ride on Saturday, Aug. 29, Chris Cox, founder of Bikers for Trump, wanted to locate a deserving veteran to receive a MAGA hat signed by President Trump. One veteran, Rick Darrenkamp, stood out to him, though he did not know his name until later. Darrenkamp told Cox he served in Vietnam in ‘68 and ‘69 and had a brief visit before parking his trike at Kightlinger Motors, Coudersport, the final destination for the ride. When Cox took the stage, he called for the veteran to come up to the stage, he had something for him, but Darrenkamp had already left to attend a different event. Cheryl Main, of Larry’s Sport Center, was asked to locate this veteran. There were an estimated 400 veterans in attendance but with the help of the Trump Thunder ride video, by JTM Productions 916, Main was able to identify Darrenkamp as the chosen veteran. Larry’s hosted approximately 200 guests on Sept. 5 where the Trump hat was presented to Darrenkamp, who has already contracted a friend to build a special display case for the hat. Also announced at the hat presentation, “Trump Thunder II” in Tioga County, also known as Trump Thunder in Canyon Country, will be held on Sunday, Oct. 4.

""The one thing we agree on is this: People that are threatening themselves or others shouldn\'t have a firearm,"" Ferrari said. ""We already have a law on the books that allows law enforcement to take a person who\'s a threat to themselves or others and we can immediately take them down to the hospital."" Ferrari said the statute allows for legal counsel and judicial review, and focuses on getting treatment to people who need it rather than focusing on their property. ""Both sides would have agreed on that, but egos got in the way,"" Ferrari said. ""They weren\'t happy with amending something. It was all about the title. It wasn\'t the new law that the new governor came up with. It was a campaign promise that was met."" Ferrari maintained the law still presents Fourth Amendment concerns regarding privacy and property. He called it ""a Pandora\'s box skirting around constitutional limits"" in ways that will be tested before judges. Ferrari argued that the law can be manipulated by law enforcement to use a civil process for discovery of criminal evidence. ""Unfortunately, the train was really being driven by a lot of Second Amendment stuff because we\'re talking about guns here, and not everybody\'s a gun owner,"" he said. ""Well, now let\'s talk about me beating on your door and coming into your house."" Stewart, on the other hand, said: ""It\'s about having another tool in our bag and I think we use them — let\'s give law enforcement a little more credit — I think we use these things judiciously."" As elected law enforcement officers, Ferrari argued he and other sheriffs were exercising a duty to warn the public about legislation that endangered their liberties. In opposition to gun legislation filed during the 2019 legislative session, a majority of New Mexico counties passed resolutions stating they would not require their sheriffs to enforce the proposals if they became law. More: What people in \'Second Amendment sanctuaries\' should know about red flag laws Ferrari spoke to the Sun-News days before Gov. Lujan Grisham signed the bill and issued her challenge to sheriffs resistant to enforcing the law. He made clear that sheriffs answered to voters. ""Our job is to stand between law enforcement and the public,"" he said. ""We answer to no one but the public. No one. We\'re not overseen by a division of anything, we don\'t share our powers like country commissioners and city councilors. We are directly responsible for the people who put us in power. "" Enforcing protective orders under the act might also endanger his deputies, Ferrari said: ""This can put law enforcement at risk and it also can put the public at risk. It definitely treads on that line of trust that we have."" For Stewart, the rhetorical focus on the Bill of Rights by sheriffs opposed to SB 5 risked omitting the rule of law. ""I take an oath to the Constitution and the laws of the state of New Mexico,"" Stewart said. ""If I swear allegiance to the Constitution of the U.S. only, I could never arrest a murderer or a rapist. The U.S. Constitution doesn\'t mention them. The only thing that gives me that power is the state."" Stewart\'s support for the law have made her unpopular with the New Mexico Sheriff\'s Association, which has firmly opposed red flag laws. ""They don\'t talk to me,"" she said. More: New Mexico \'red flag\' bill protested at the state Capitol in Santa Fe Where she and Ferrari agree is that the new law has ambiguities and unclear consequences that will lead to court challenges and perhaps amendments in subsequent legislative sessions in Santa Fe. ""There are real legitimate questions that this doesn’t address and that will certainly be ferreted out through the legal system and the judiciary,"" Stewart said. Ferrari expressed little faith that lawmakers would improve the law next year, and did not guess how courts might rule on legal challenges to a law he criticized as both ill-conceived and rushed. ""What is more important,"" he asked, ""that New Mexico joins the red flag club or that we have good legislation? Because we don\'t.""

AMBER ARNOLD, STATE JOURNAL Beniot Green, left, and Arsenio Sorrell, with a picture of their mother, Lolita Dotson, of Madison, who died from COVID-19 at age 53 in June. “I would hope people would be more considerate,"" said Sorrell, a certified nursing assistant. ""The person you infect might work at a nursing home. You might put everybody in that nursing home at risk.” Growing up in Chicago, Lolita Dotson was 13 when her mother died.

Dotson tested positive for COVID-19 on May 14, Sorrell said. She was admitted to UW Hospital’s COVID-19 unit five days later. After developing pneumonia, she was placed on a ventilator May 27. The next day, she had a stroke. She failed to recover and died after being taken off the ventilator. Sorrell, a certified nursing assistant at SSM Health St. Mary’s Hospital in Madison, worked in the hospital’s COVID-19 unit in the spring and said he wishes people would take steps to reduce the spread of the virus. “At the hospital, I’ve seen it first-hand. I’ve seen it in my house first-hand,” he said. “It could be anybody next time. It could be your parents. It could be your sister, brother, grandma and grandpa, uncle or aunt.” Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group'}]"

SWATARA TWP., Pa.— President Donald Trump took a central Pennsylvania stage with a fresh, major achievement to tout: his hours-old pick of Amy Coney Barrett to fill the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the U.S. Supreme Court. If she’s confirmed, Republicans will realize their long-running goal of a conservative-dominated court. A large monitor above the audience read: “FILL THAT SEAT!” Then, Trump pivoted to his primary theme for Saturday night, bashing Democratic opponent Joe Biden. After referring to Barrett’s stellar academic record, Trump said, “That’s a little better than Joe Biden, wouldn’t you say? She should be running for president.” Thousands attended the outdoor rally at Harrisburg International Airport near Harrisburg. A drizzle began falling shortly before Trump began; he stood under it unsheltered in a blue suit. Even in the dreary weather, Trump still spoke for more than an hour. The night was also plagued by poor volume, with Trump’s words often faint. Neither problem dampened the enthusiasm, with the crowd frequently breaking into chants, shouting out their love for Trump and hurling insults at CNN reporters. Trump focused on familiar themes, telling the crowd police departments would be “crippled” under Biden, people would lose Second Amendment rights to own guns, and that Biden will ban fracking. “He wants to eradicate all that you’re doing, all that you’re doing to bring money into your state. It’s a disgrace,” he said. Biden has said he has no plans to ban fracking and doubts it’s even possible. Rather, he has cited goals of eliminating power plant emissions in 15-30 years, eliminating subsidies for gas and coal, and banning “only new oil and gas permits, fracking included, on federal land.” RELATED: Here are Trump’s, Biden’s positions on fracking, police, other issues that could decide Pennsylvania The majority of people who packed the hangar area at Trump\'s rally at HIA Saturday wore no face mask. Trump accused Biden of changing his position on fracking after receiving the nomination. “That’s what you call a really dumb, dishonest politician,” Trump said. While Biden has also pushed for universal background checks for firearms purchases and other measures to curb gun violence, he has said he has no plans to abolish the Second Amendment. Hours before the rally, Biden issued a statement Saturday, saying Trump’s “refusal to take strong, swift action” has worsened the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed 203,000 American lives, including 8,000 in Pennsylvania. “Were it not for President Trump’s failed leadership, thousands of Pennsylvania families would not have suffered such horrific loss and countless others would not be faced with economic hardship, including the nearly 20,000 people out of work in Dauphin County today,” Biden said. Trump on Saturday night said the fatality rate for COVID-19 has fallen significantly and promised “a safe vaccine in record time.” Gov. Tom Wolf criticized Trump for holding the rally, saying, “His decision to bring thousands of people together in a tight space in the midst of a global pandemic caused by an airborne virus is flat out wrong. No matter what party you support, all Americans should be very concerned that the president has put headlines and publicity above the health and safety of our families and communities.” On Saturday night, people spent hours packed tightly together, with many not wearing masks or with their mask hanging below their chin. The event underscored the critical importance of Pennsylvania in the presidential election, as many analysts have said the winner here will win the White House. Trump’s rally at HIA marked his second public event in Pennsylvania in less than a week. On Tuesday, Trump held an event at Pittsburgh International Airport that drew a large crowd. Trump has now been to Pennsylvania five times this month. Biden has also made several Pennsylvania appearances in recent weeks. Showing he’s paying attention to central Pennsylvania as well, Biden spent part of Labor Day in Harrisburg and Lancaster. In 2016, Trump won Pennsylvania by just 44,292 votes — a difference of 0.7% out of about 6 million votes cast. The 2020 outcome could be similarly close, with political analyst G. Terry Madonna this week saying Pennsylvania is “up for grabs.” The latest polls show a tightening race with Biden appearing slightly ahead. A Franklin & Marshall College poll this week showed Biden with a 6-point lead; a Great Lakes Poll found Biden leading by 2.7 percentage points. However, both polls were within the margin error. At HIA on Saturday night, people began arriving in the morning and the crowd far outnumbered available seats three hours before Trump was scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. It was hard to find anyone who expects a close race. “I think it’s going to be landslide. Look at this place,” said Bob Belinger, 62, of Reading. Asked what Trump has done to put himself in such a strong position, Belinger said, “promises made, promises kept.” He named “building that wall” as his favorite Trump achievement. Heather Meyer of Lenhartsville in Berks County said, “I don’t believe the polls.” “I just think he understands the people of this country,” the 51-year-old said of Trump. “Biden is out of touch.” Jamie Erb of York said Trump is “one of the best presidents we ever had,” maybe second only to Abraham Lincoln. Erb, who has young children, said Trump has greatly improved education by opposing the “common core” educational standards. She also named health care as one of Trump’s top achievements, even with Erb and her children covered by Medicaid, which is a central part of Obamacare, and could disappear if Trump succeeds in overturning the Affordable Care Act. However, Erb said a divorce created a complicated health insurance for herself and her children and she likes the available options, including Medicaid coverage for one of her children who had brain surgery. “There’s a lot out there that we didn’t have before,” said Erb, 45. At one point on Saturday night, Trump invited Patrick Yoes, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police to the stage. Before the cheering crowd, Yoes told Trump the organization was endorsing the president. “We went from public servants to public villains overnight … you sir, have never turned your back on America’s law enforcement,” Yoes said. Trump, who spoke for about 70 minutes, said Biden and Democrats would bring about socialized medicine, and declare the death penalty unconstitutional “for even the most depraved mass murderers.” He predicted the worst Depression in history, worse than the 1930s, if Biden is elected. He detailed alleged incidents of voter fraud. That included nine mail-in ballots from members of the military, with seven favoring Trump, found in the trash in Luzern County. Luzerne officials said it resulted from a mistake by an independent contractor who was immediately fired. They said it wasn’t an attempt at fraud, and the fact it was caught and immediately brought to the attention of federal authorities shows the system is working. FBI director Chris Wray told a U.S. Senate committee this week, “We have not seen historically any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it’s by mail or otherwise.” Wray added that fraud has been found “at the local level from time to time.” Trump urged the crowd at the rally to vote on Election Day, telling those in attendance to make sure their families, friends and co-workers cast their ballots as well. “The only way they can win Pennsylvania, frankly, is to cheat at the ballot box,” Trump said Saturday night. Trump also touted his measures to bolster America’s energy independence and his withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. “I was elected to fight for Pennsylvania, not for Paris,"" he said.

coronavirus cases climb in Pennsylvania and across the U.S. Yet, area hospitals and the Pennsylvania Department of Health say they have enough PPE to counter a resurgence of respiratory illness from COVID-19 and the flu. Through the summer, Pennsylvania stocked up on medical supplies in anticipation of a “full resurgence because we knew it was coming,” said Nate Wardle, state health department spokesman. Cases began climbing in late September, even as few people got tested. On Sept. 27, 15,696 Pennsylvanians were tested and 6% came back positive, according to John Hopkins. On Oct. 25, 12,860 were tested and 11.3% had COVID-19. More: Bucks, Montco seeing increases as Pa. COVID cases continue to spike More: COVID-19 in Pennsylvania: Growing demand for expanded nursing home visitation On Tuesday, the national Public Interest Research Group released its latest report of PPE shortages. The organization gave the U.S. an ""F"" grade on its response to the virus. “It’s unconscionable that the United States is dealing with severe PPE shortages at this point in the pandemic,"" said Teresa Murray, U.S. PIRG Education Fund Consumer Watchdog. ""It’s affecting everyone, including hospitals, businesses and schools."" On Sept. 21, the U.S. General Accountability Office first warned of ""shortages of certain types of personal protective equipment and testing supplies remain due to a supply chain with limited domestic production and high global demand."" Attempts to monitor and treat the virus will be slowed by ""ongoing shortages of testing supplies, including swabs, reagents, tubes, pipettes, and transport media,"" according to the report. ""Testing supply shortages have contributed to delays in turnaround times for testing results."" At St. Mary Medical Center in Middletown, marketing director Christy McCabe said the hospital system is “currently” able to meet demands. St. Mary staff urged area residents to continue to socially distance, wash hands and wear masks. “Currently, we are able to provide PPE to our colleagues per the CDC guidelines for safe care, and are able to meet our community’s need for COVID-19 testing,” said McCabe. “Over the last several months, we have worked diligently and in concert with our national Trinity Health ministry and various vendors to increase supplies, and we are keeping a close eye on the trends in COVID-19 cases and our capacity.” Doylestown Hospital also said it is “not anticipating difficulties” in maintaining PPE in the event of a surge from COVID-19 or influenza, said Ron Watson, communications and government affairs director for the medical center. To combat shortfalls, Doylestown moved to a decontamination system, which allows the reuse of some materials, Watson said. “We ran this operation (Bioquell, with hydrogen peroxide) daily or twice daily during the peak,” said Watson. “Now we operate it once or twice a week to extend the useful life of some PPE.” Gov. Tom Wolf has issued statements to ensure that Pennsylvania has enough supplies. “We have significantly more PPE on hand to assist those who need it than we had prior to COVID-19. We continue to push PPE to those who need and request it and will work to ensure we keep our stockpile filled,” said Wolf, in a recent press release. “PA businesses really stepped up to help, and we are prepared with a stockpile now, and this goes hand in hand with our other efforts to mitigate COVID-19,” added Wardle. Still, Americans need to do their part in combating the virus, said Wardle. ""Pennsylvanians need to continue social distancing, wearing masks, and doing all of the things that we know help to keep us safe – that’s the best way to protect yourself and your family, but it also protects our health care workers.”'}]"

It already had been screening for illness among passengers arriving from the epicenter of China’s outbreak at five U.S. airports. But people who’ve visited other parts of China still may be arriving, with stops in other places first. Now, CDC is sending extra staff to other “quarantine stations” to screen arrivals at a total of 18 airports around the country and at two border crossings, in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego.The State Department has also chartered a plane to evacuate diplomats from the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, the city where the outbreak started, and some other Americans.Asked if those evacuees would be quarantined, Azar said there will be doctors on the flight to check all the passengers so health officials can decide if additional steps are needed.With an incubation period of anywhere from two to 14 days, travelers may arrive showing no symptoms. But CDC’s Dr. Nancy Messonnier said the screenings are an opportunity to educate travelers that if they start feeling sick — with a fever, cough or flu-like symptoms — after returning from an outbreak zone, they should contact their doctor. That’s exactly what the first U.S. patients did.Azar said he has directed $105 million to fight the outbreak. Among the next steps, the CDC developed a test for the virus and aims to make it usable by state health departments, to speed diagnosis of suspected cases. Research also is under way to develop a vaccine or treatment.Airport screenings were initially done in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Atlanta. That has been expanded to Anchorage, Alaska; Boston; Dallas; Detroit; El Paso, Texas; Honolulu; Houston, Miami, Minneapolis; Newark, New Jersey; Philadelphia; San Diego; Seattle; Washington, D.C. (Dulles); and San Juan, Puerto Rico. “At this point Americans should not worry for their own safety,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters Tuesday. China has confirmed more than 4,500 people with the respiratory illness, which in severe cases can cause pneumonia, with dozens more counted in other countries. In the U.S. so far, there are five confirmed patients, all of whom had traveled to the hardest-hit part of China — and no sign that they have spread the illness to anyone around them. Still, “this is a very fast-moving, constantly changing situation,” Azar added. Flanked by the government’s top infection specialists, Azar listed the biggest unanswered questions of the outbreak and tried to tamp down some of the fear and speculation provoked by China’s rising toll: How deadly is this new virus? China’s death toll has passed 100 but the first patients counted in an outbreak “are naturally the most severe cases” and “skew our understanding,” Azar cautioned. Over time, if doctors find many more people had just a mild, cold-like illness, the death rate will change. How easily does it spread? One way to measure that is an estimate of how many people could catch an infection from one contagious patient. Some reports have suggested that number might be between 1.5 and 3.5 for the new coronavirus, but Azar stressed it’s too soon to know. For comparison, one patient with measles could spread it to 12 to 18 others, he added. What about silent carriers? Reports from China suggest some people may have spread the virus before showing symptoms. And Germany on Tuesday said a man with the virus near Munich never traveled to China or had close contact with anyone showing symptoms. Instead, he may have been infected by a coworker from China who briefly visited for a company training session and didn’t report feeling ill until her flight home. Some viruses, such as the flu, can spread before symptoms are obvious. But there’s no evidence it’s happened with the new virus in the U.S., where health officials are checking contacts of the sick. And epidemics are driven by the openly sick, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief of the National Institutes of Health. Still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wants to send its own scientists to visit China for a first-hand look try to answer those questions.

two big properties are in court on assessment appeals, the results of which could greatly affect property tax revenue.District CFO Steve Skrocki reported this week that two properties, including one of the biggest taxpayers in the district, could soon be headed to court over their assessed property values.“We typically try to settle these assessment appeal cases, both initiated by the school district and by the property owner, we try to settle these without appraisals,” Skrocki said.“Basically, a judge in the county courthouse has been assigned to mediate these cases, and the judge pretty much demands appraisals be done as part of the negotiation process,” he said.Each year the district targets certain property owners where it feels the assessed values are too low, and occasionally reaches settlements requiring board approval that agree on a new value, and when property owners feel their value is too high the process is reversed, with the owner seeking a lower value and the district occasionally issuing rebates.On Monday night, Skrocki reported on two particularly thorny cases: one for the “North Wales Crossing” shopping center at 782 Bethlehem Pike, and the other for the Montgomery Mall, that have gone beyond the typical process.“We have one case coming up that is a district-initiated appeal, it goes back four years, and the assessed value for that property is

Skrocki said specializes in doing such appraisals of malls.Both cases are currently scheduled for mediation as part of a Montgomery County case management program in January, a program Skrocki said was “pretty much on hold the last couple of years” but has recently been revived, by a judge that often insists on having appraisals from both sides.“We're thinking we're going to see more of these

MediaNews Group file photo Shoppers on Black Friday at the Montgomery Mall in 2013. (MediaNews Group file photo) LANSDALE – As the North Penn school board starts to plan its 2021-22 budget, two big properties are in court on assessment appeals, the results of which could greatly affect property tax revenue.District CFO Steve Skrocki reported this week that two properties, including one of the biggest taxpayers in the district, could soon be headed to court over their assessed property values.“We typically try to settle these assessment appeal cases, both initiated by the school district and by the property owner, we try to settle these without appraisals,” Skrocki said.“Basically, a judge in the county courthouse has been assigned to mediate these cases, and the judge pretty much demands appraisals be done as part of the negotiation process,” he said.Each year the district targets certain property owners where it feels the assessed values are too low, and occasionally reaches settlements requiring board approval that agree on a new value, and when property owners feel their value is too high the process is reversed, with the owner seeking a lower value and the district occasionally issuing rebates.On Monday night, Skrocki reported on two particularly thorny cases: one for the “North Wales Crossing” shopping center at 782 Bethlehem Pike, and the other for the Montgomery Mall, that have gone beyond the typical process.“We have one case coming up that is a district-initiated appeal, it goes back four years, and the assessed value for that property is $3.8 million, for North Wales Crossing,” Skrocki said.“We have not had appraisals done on this property before. It’s a district appraisal, needed for us to make a compelling argument that the assessed value should be increase,” he said. To make that case, staff have proposed a contract with appraiser Integra Realty Services, with a cost of $10,000 to perform the appraisal, and details of that contract are included in the board’s meeting materials for Dec. 7. The second appeal is much larger: for the Montgomery Mall itself, where three parcels under appeal are assessed at roughly $81.6 million, and whose owner is seeking a lower valuation and therefore a lower tax bill.“The Montgomery Mall is the school district’s second-largest taxpayer, and generates about $2.1 million in real estate taxes on an annual basis. This one is really important,” Skrocki said.“This is more complex than the previous one. The previous one was a strip mall, this is the actual mall itself, and as you know, many malls are suffering throughout the area, and throughout the United States,” he said.To do that assessment, staff are proposing a $20,000 contract with Capital Valuation Partners, a firm Skrocki said specializes in doing such appraisals of malls.Both cases are currently scheduled for mediation as part of a Montgomery County case management program in January, a program Skrocki said was “pretty much on hold the last couple of years” but has recently been revived, by a judge that often insists on having appraisals from both sides.“We’re thinking we’re going to see more of these appraisals” as other appeals are made, Skrocki said.Board member Elisha Gee asked if recent headlines about a possible loan default by Simon Properties, owner of the Montgomery Mall, would have any impact on that assessment challenge. Skrocki said those news stories largely focused on Simon’s plans to default “on a pretty substantial loan that it has – Simon has indicated it would simply walk away from the loan,” but doing so would not change the real estate taxes due on their properties.“What’s going to drive the value of the property is really the lease revenue generated by the tenants in the mall. As we all know, malls are suffering – it’s probably a new era, with respect to consumer behavior and online shopping,” he said.Board member Cathy Wesley asked if the costs of the appraisals could be shared with other entities, like Montgomery County or the local municipality, that are also impacted by a change in assessment, or if assessments could be bundled together to get lower pricing.“It’s already borne by the school district, because we have the most amount of skin in the game.

COVID-19 AND YOU?:STORIES FROM THE PEOPLEDURING THE PANDEMIC On any normal given week, Clayholm Farms, in Worthington, produces around 217,000 pounds of raw milk, which in turn goes to Schneider’s Dairy in Pittsburgh. However, in a recent interview with the Leader Times, all four farm co-owners said this is not a normal time people are living in. The four co-owners — Rebecca, Roy, Leland and Margaret Claypoole — spoke on how the farm, and the entire farming industry as a whole, has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 virus. The farm, which has been open since 1941, produces approximately 217,000 pounds of “raw,” or unpasteurized milk to Schneider’s Dairy in Pittsburgh. “The prices are going down due to COVID, so we are getting paid less,” Rebecca said. Added Roy: “It’s a struggle to pay bills.” Dumping milk down the drain Roy said Clayholm Farms has been around since 1941, and currently employs five full-time, and four part-time workers, plus the occasional seasonal help. He and Rebecca said due to coronavirus, businesses that usually takes milk from Schneider’s, such as restaurants, aren’t open to the public. This has led to a situation where the farm has a surplus of raw milk that they can’t give away, leaving them with no choice but to literally dump the access milk down the drain. “We can’t shut our cows off. They’re still producing,” Rebecca said. “We have less money and more backed up products.” Added Rebecca: “We still got to buy feed. That’s still pricey. It’s not like you can’t feed your cows.” Margaret said other dairy farms in the area are in the same situation as them, forced to horde or dump access milk they can’t give to their suppliers. Roy and Margaret said Schneider’s has been giving bottled milk to food banks and different school programs. However, Rebecca said Clayholm cannot do the same because they are not allowed to give away raw, unpasteurized, milk without a special license from the state. “It all has to go to Schneider’s. They have to process it, then bottle it,” Rebecca said. “It costs money to process it.” Added Rebecca: “It costs money to kept employees at the dairy running the factory. It costs money for the guy in the milk truck to deliver it somewhere.” Pennies on the dollar The Leader Times asked the owners what they felt about recent federal, state, and local support of different farmers in the county, such as from U.S. Rep. Glenn “GT” Thompson (R-15), who have fought for financial support and encouragement. While the owners appreciate any support they can get, they all agree that it is “pennies on the dollar,” compared to the real costs it takes to run a farm, and to account for any losses they may be accruing annually, not just due to COVID. “The leaders have been trying. They say they’re fighting for the farmers, but there is only so far they can go,” Rebecca said. “The help that we get is small compared to the bigger picture, with the bills and feed bills.” Added Margaret: “We don’t want bailouts. We want to be able to ship our stuff at a fair price, so we can get paid a fair share.” Encourage whole milk Roy said a big problem for dairy farms like Clayholm, before the COVID-19 pandemic, was that businesses and institutions, as well as Americans as a whole, are not drinking or buying as much whole milk. Instead, many is turning to other kinds of milk such as skim, fat-free, 1 and 2 percent, or alternatives to milk such as almond and coconut milk. He and Margaret believe people need to realize that whole milk is not as “fattening” as many people believe, as it is a 97 percent fat free. Roy also believes whole milk needs to be brought back to be served in school, as he said students are growing up not liking the taste of milk, as they drink 1 or 2 percent milk instead, which he said tastes very differently than whole milk. All owners also believe that through this whole pandemic experience, people need to realize where the food the crave comes from, and how much hard work goes into growing and preparing the food for the table.
