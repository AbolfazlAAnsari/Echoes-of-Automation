The Raiders and Buccaneers will battle it out on Saturday Stuntman and thrill seeker Vaughn Shafer is preparing for his world record attempt Saturday at the Western Colorado Drag Way in Orchard Mesa. Vaughn set the old world record back in 1999 and is looking to remain the fastest man on a motorized skateboard. WesternSlopeNow caught up with Vaughn a day before the big event to find out what he had been doing to prepare. ""74.38 (MPH) that was set there (Western Colorado Drag Way) in 1999. And we\'re pretty well above that and feeling really comfortable and in the last two weeks that we\'ve done testing and such, there are no more bugs with the board. It\'s just going to be about me focusing and watching my speedometer and making sure I just don\'t go gangbusters."" Vaughn\'s first test run will start at 2 p.m. and will make his world record attempt at 6 p.m. Passersby dialed 911 after seeing a shed catch fire near the intersection of 30 Road and D Road. Witness to the explosion Eric Osiecki describes what he saw when the explosion happened. ""It looked like it was a shed that was on fire, and then we heard a couple of explosions."" Osiecki says the Grand Junction Fire Department was quick to respond and quick to knock down the fire. ""They (GJFD) had the fire out probably within about five minutes."" Public Information Officer for GJFD Dirk Clingman has this advice for homeowners as we enter a hot summer season. ""Household items that get stored in sheds, a lot of them can cause small explosions when involved in a fire."" One of those items is gasoline cans. Clingman says temperature control is the best way to prevent a fire. ""It\'s important to make sure that the shed is not raising to a temperature over 80 degrees to safely store gasoline."" Clingman says propane tanks should be stored outside, in the shade and standing upright. And as the transition to battery power becomes more common, Clingman says mistakes in their storage do too. ""If you\'re using a lot of equipment that requires batteries, make sure that you\'re following the manufacturer\'s instructions to store them safely. Electric vehicles, electric motors, any of these things that require great big batteries... if there is a fire they can be very dangerous. So, it\'s always important to do your due diligence and make sure you\'re using products that are UL listed to make sure they are safe and that they have been tested."" Watching how you store anything explosive or flammable could save you a lot of time and trouble as summer temperatures start to soar. 31-year-old Angela Klickner turned herself in to local law enforcement after Mesa County Sheriff\'s Office issued a warrant for her arrest. Klickner is facing 10 charges, including sexual assault on a child by a person in a position of trust, related to an incident at Landmark Baptist Church where she volunteered from 2022 to 2023. On Thursday, Angela Klickner appeared in Judge Barrett\'s Mesa County courtroom for a bond hearing. Klickner, along with her family, requested the court to lower the bond or allow a PR bond with GPS monitoring. Her family, including Klickner\'s four children, wrote letters to the court explaining how much they needed her. A mother of one of the victims addressed the court on behalf of all the victims and their parents, asking for a higher bond, as they do not feel that GPS monitoring can keep their children safe. Judge Barrett ruled to keep Klickner\'s bail at a $100,000 cash bond. Klickner\'s husband stormed out of the courtroom, throwing something to the ground as he walked out. When he returned to the courtroom, Judge Barrett asked him to remain outside for the rest of the hearing.
