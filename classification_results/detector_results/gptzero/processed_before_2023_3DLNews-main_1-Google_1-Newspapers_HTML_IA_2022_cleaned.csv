Funeral services will be held Tuesday, November 29th at 10:30am at Clarion First United Methodist Church with an additional one-hour visitation prior to funeral services. Marilyn Marie Beenken was born September 18, 1951, in Fort Dodge, Iowa to Donald Junior Beenken and Marie Cindy Williams Beenken. She was raised in Clarion, Iowa where she attended the Clarion School system and graduated in 1969. On March 7, 1970, Marilyn married Karl M. Olsen and they were married 52+ years. They made their home in Clarion where they raised their two children. While raising her own children, Marilyn ran a daycare out of her home caring for countless children of all ages. She later attended Iowa Central Community College which is where she found her real calling in the nursing field. Marilyn treated every patient with great compassion and made them feel like they were her number one priority. Patients would repeatedly walk up to her years after their hospital encounter and thank her for challenging them to stretch their limits to help them return to a normal life. Calling Marilyn an avid bargain hunter is a bit of an understatement. Her “Black Friday” outings were the “stuff of legend”. While most people might walk out of a store with one or two crock pots, Marilyn was known to depart the store with eight or nine. Numerous times people would mention they would need something as a gift for a wedding or baby shower and there was a good chance Marilyn had one sitting in the trunk of her car. It was rumored that QVC and the Home Shopping Network(HSN) were on speed dial on her phone, but some of life’s mysteries are better left unknown. As COVID restrictions affected our lives the last two years, Marilyn had to retire to safely care for Karl. If life decided to hand her lemons, Marilyn was going to make lemonade. This life change enabled her to combine her enormous compassion for her friends and family with her “shopping prowess” and provide grocery shopping for others, helping provide sustenance while keeping them safe. Marilyn is survived by her husband Karl; children Brent & Lisa Olsen of Waukee, IA; Chad & Deana Olsen of Conroe, TX; Grandchildren Lexi, Lincoln, Landry, Lawson, Ethan, Jase, Christian and Evelyn; and brothers Robert and David Beenken Marilyn was preceded in death by her parents Donald and Marie Beenken and brother Dennis Beenken.

A jury in Idaho has unanimously agreed that convicted killer Chad Daybell deserves the death penalty for the gruesome murders of his wife and his girlfriend’s two youngest children. The decision ends a grim case that began in 2019 with a search for two missing children. The 55-year-old Daybell showed no emotion Saturday when learning he will face the death penalty for the murders of Tammy Daybell; 16-year-old Tylee Ryan; and 7-year-old Joshua “JJ” Vallow. Idaho law allows for execution by lethal injection or firing squad, though firing squad executions have never been used in the state. During a nearly two-month-long trial, prosecutors said Daybell promoted apocalyptic prophecies and tales of possession by evil spirits to justify the killings. Atlanta officials were slowly repressuring the city’s water system after corroding water pipes burst in downtown and Midtown, forcing many businesses and attractions to close and affecting water service in area homes. The problems began Friday morning and crews were still working Saturday to restore service. The department issued a boil water advisory for a large swath of metro Atlanta and asked the public to restrict water usage to allow the pressure in the system to rebuild. Water gushed into the street where three large water mains intersect, causing water problems at two downtown hospitals a city jail, a county jail and local shelters. Attractions like the Georgia Aquarium remained closed Saturday. Israel’s prime minister calls a permanent cease-fire in Gaza a “nonstarter” until long-standing conditions for the ending the war are met. The statement appears to undermine a proposal that U.S. President Joe Biden announced as an Israeli one on Friday. A massive demonstration in Israel led by families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas urges the government to accept the proposal. Biden asserted that Hamas is no longer capable of another large-scale attack on Israel. He urged Israel and Hamas to agree to an extended cease-fire. Hamas says it views the proposal “positively.” Meanwhile, Israel presses its military offensive in Rafah. A crowd of students protesting the war in Gaza walked out of the University of Chicago’s commencement. And the school is withholding the diplomas of four seniors over their involvement with a pro-Palestinian encampment that was cleared last month.

As we may know, April Fools Day fell on a Friday this year. I had scheduled to take the afternoon off due to the forecast showing it to be a beautiful day, and it most certainly was. I was over in Ames when a former colleague of mine sent me a message on Messenger. When you see something on April Fools Day that starts with “This is not an april fools joke,” you tend to already take it with a grain of salt. My friend began to explain to me that the newspaper we had both previously worked at was being sold. On April Fools Day. A couple of weeks ago I had the fun privilege of being part of a group of employees from Mid America Publishing, who owns the newspaper, that got to go to the Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines to cover the state wrestling tournament. For years I never got why people loved wrestling so much despite living in Iowa all of my life. I always found it to be weird and kind of boring. I usually enjoyed the kind of wrestling that involved John Cena more than what goes on in a high school gym on a mat. A friend once told me that with kids, ‘yes’ should be your answer most of the time. Say ‘no’ when you really mean it and stick to it. I’m just wondering, in our day and age, do kids hear yes too often? When they hear no, do they act as if it’s negotiable? I sometimes fear we try to make life for our youth too easy. I think it’s a divine plan that toddlers stumble and fall often when they’re learning to walk. After all, they don’t have far to fall; they have the resilience of youth and don’t give up easily.

Yes, like many people I am really excited that he finally won a Super Bowl. Yes, he was pretty clutch in the playoffs this year and yes, he proved he could win on the big stage. However, the Rams Super Bowl victory doesn’t automatically place him on the road to Canton for numerous reasons. Winning a Super Bowl doesn’t mean people should start thinking, ‘yep he’s a hall of famer’. Those who think so are jumping on the hype train and need to take a step back. Personally I think we have lowered the bar for the Hall of Fame too low in recent years. Too many players that deserve to be in the hall of really good, get in. Stafford is in that boat. He was severely underrated in Detroit, surrounded by bad talent, management and ownership. But, just because he could’ve been a better quarterback elsewhere and what he did do in Detroit is impressive, doesn’t warrant a gold jacket. Look at his teammate in Detroit, Calvin Johnson. Johnson was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame this past year. Johnson was a dominant and consistent wide receiver with a sucky team. Just like Stafford he stayed loyal, probably too loyal to Detroit. However, unlike Stafford, he was named to First-Team All-Pro three times, Second-Team All-Pro once, six consecutive Pro Bowl honors, and selected to the NFL’s All-Decade Team of the 2010s. Stafford on the other hand, so far in his career, has never been named to the all decade team, doesn’t have an All-Pro, not been named MVP, only has one Pro Bowl (which honestly means less nowadays), and didn’t even get named the MVP of the Super Bowl. When you think of the 2010s in Detroit, you think of Megatron. He was the best player on that Lions team. Johnson is the Lions franchise leader in basically every wide receiver statistic, and is the franchises greatest wideout. Even ranked against other HOF wide receivers, Johnson ranks in the middle of three of the four major categories, leading yards per game. Why this is impressive is because he only played nine seasons, retiring way earlier than most thought, yet despite his limited season he stacks up equally against people who had years on him. This is the kind of player you put into the HOF. Not a player who, although pretty good and a nice story, joins a NBA-like super team and wins the Super Bowl. I understand the Super Bowl is way harder to win, i.e. my Packers, but it is a team and he had two HOF’ers on his defense meaning he wasn’t carrying the team necessarily. Now, I’m not saying he won’t make it into the HOF by the end of his career. He has played so long that he ranks pretty high in most stat lists, and he has played better than most, especially in Detroit. For me to make it to the HOF you have to be the one of the best if not the best player of your position for multiple years. You have to show the playoff consistency and hardware/awards. Stafford just hasn’t gotten there yet. If he wins another Super Bowl or two or wins MVP in the next few years, then give me a call. Accessibility Tools'}]"

Iowa DNR received final approval of this submittal from the U.S. EPA on April 29, 2022. Public comments were sought on Iowa’s draft 2022 list of impaired waters from February 18, 2022, through March 19, 2022. Iowa DNR prepared a summary of responses to the 15 comments received on the draft 2022 list of Impaired Waters Iowa’s draft list was updated following the public comment period and Iowa\'s final 2022 Impaired Waters list, as submitted to U.S. EPA, contained 597 waterbodies with a total of 786 impairments. Materials for review Iowa\'s Section 303(d) lists and Integrated Reports are prepared according to Iowa DNR\'s assessment and listing methodology and follow U.S. EPA guidelines for ""integrated reporting"" that combine requirements of Sections 305(b), 303(d), and 314 of the federal Clean Water Act. These U.S. EPA guidelines suggest that states place all their waters into one of the following categories that comprise a state\'s Integrated Report: Waterbodies Not Assessed: Insufficient information exists to determine whether any beneficial uses designated for that waterbody were met. These waterbodies are placed into Category 3 of the Integrated Report. Category 4: The waterbody is impaired but a TMDL is not required; the waterbody is not included on the state\'s section 303(d) list of impaired waters (Category 5 of the Integrated Report). Category 5: The states Section 303(d) list of impaired waters. The waterbody is impaired and a total maximum daily load (TMDL) is needed. WINOFI: As provided for in Iowa\'s credible data law, the Department is to maintain a separate list of waters that require further investigative monitoring. As specified in the credible data law, this list is not part of the Section 303(d)/impaired waters process in Iowa and includes waterbodies where limited information suggests, but does not conclusively (credibly) demonstrate, a water quality impairment. If the results of further investigative monitoring demonstrate, with data of sufficient quality and quantity, that a water quality impairment exists, the affected waterbody can be added to Iowa\'s Section 303(d) list. Delistings: These waters are proposed for removal from Iowa\'s previous (2020) list of impaired waters. A rationale for each proposed delisting is provided. [*Designated uses are beneficial uses applied to specific Iowa surface waters (streams, rivers, lakes, and wetlands) in the Iowa Water Quality Standards. Examples of beneficial uses are uses for primary contact recreation (for example, swimming-type uses), aquatic life protection, and as a source of water for a public water supply. Beneficial uses designated for Iowa\'s surface waters are protected by narrative and numeric water quality criteria. For a more detailed description of designated uses applied to Iowa surface waters, see pages 9 and 10 [Surface Water Quality Criteria, Designated Use Segments] of the Iowa Water Quality Standards. For a list of the Iowa surface waters and their respective designated uses, see Iowa\'s Surface Water Classification.] Healthy waters are those segments in Integrated Report Categories 1 and 2. Category 1: All designated uses are met Category 2: One or more designated uses are met, but there are insufficient data to determine if the remaining designated uses are met. As provided for in Iowa\'s Credible Data Law, the Department is to maintain a separate list of waters that require further investigative monitoring. This list is not part of the Section 303(d)/impaired waters process in Iowa and includes segments where limited information suggests, but does not conclusively (credibly) demonstrate, a water quality impairment. If the results of further investigative monitoring demonstrate, with data of sufficient quality and quantity, that a water quality impairment exists, the affected segment can be added to Iowa\'s Section 303(d) list. Impaired waters are those segments in Integrated Report Categories 4 and 5. Category 4: The segment is impaired but a TMDL is not required; the segment is not included on the state\'s section 303(d) list of impaired waters (Category 5 of the Integrated Report). Category 5: Iowa\'s Section 303(d) List of Impaired Waters. The segment is impaired and a total maximum daily load (TMDL) is needed. The number of assessments the Iowa DNR can make in a given cycle are limited by budgets and staffing resources. Iowa maintains a separate list, per the Credible Data Law, of segments with insufficient information (WINOFI). Because these segments do not have enough information to determine use support, EPA considers these ""Not Assessed"". Therefore, for the purpose of reporting the Integrated Report to EPA, these WINOFI segments are grouped into the EPA\'s Category 3. For this cycle, there are a total of 295 WINOFI segments and 1235 ""Not Assessed"" segments.'}]"

Former Scott County Republican Party Chair Dave Millage said it\'s time for Republicans to accept the results of the 2020 election in an interview with CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota May 3, 2021. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday he will oppose legislation to create a commission on the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, a blow to Democrats who say an independent, bipartisan investigation of the siege is crucial to prevent it from happening again. The reaction by local Republicans to last year\'s attack on the U.S. Capitol largely reflected divisions in the party nationally. While many members of the GOP continue to support former president Donald Trump, others resent his influence, especially related to the insurrection. Dave Millage was chairman of the Scott County Republican Party on Jan. 6, 2021, and instantly was appalled by the violence that erupted at the capitol. ""I was working at Republican headquarters that day. I sat there dumbfounded,"" he said this week. ""Another person in the office that day was also watching and said, \'This needed to happen.\' ""Republicans are supposed to be the party of law and order."" Until he got the text message Wednesday afternoon, the sheriff had no idea his congresswoman… By the following day, Millage had called for Trump\'s impeachment. ""I got about 20 notes from people who were glad I stood up and asked, \'When are we going to take the party back?\'"" he said. ""There were more people who were upset. ""Those who were upset wanted me to apologize. That\'s why I resigned."" Millage left the county chairmanship, which he already planned to do when his term was set to expire the following month. He doesn\'t regret it. ""To have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump, that\'s what they\'re going to need,"" he said. ""He\'s a cancer to the party. I\'m still partisan. I\'m still a Republican. ""I was appalled by what occurred on 1-6, and I couldn\'t believe everyone else wasn\'t appalled."" Millage\'s counterpart in Rock Island County, Republican Party Chairman Drue Mielke, referred to those who attacked the capitol as ""terrorists."" He said it was ""infiltrators, possibly antifa,"" that were responsible. Short for “anti-fascists,” antifa is a group of far-left-leaning activists who endorse peaceful political protest as well as confrontation against racism. A year later, Mielke continues to deny the direct involvement of Trump supporters in the siege. While more than 700 people have been identified and charged with breaching the capitol and with other crimes, Mielke maintains he hasn\'t seen connections between those people and the former president. ""I want to know who those 725 people are,"" he said. ""Do we know they\'re not antifa? I don\'t know that."" In the weeks following the riot, the FBI directly denied the conspiracy theory and said there was ""no indication"" that antifa was involved. Some of those who have been charged have specifically indicated in court that they took part in the attack at the behest of the former president. It appeared from Mielke\'s comments the day after the insurrection that he was aware that Trump supporters had likely led the charge. In response to Millage\'s call for impeachment, Mielke said, ""If we want to divide the country and anger the Trump supporters more, then that\'s what we should do."" In addition to denying the role of Trump or his supporters in the January 6 attack, Mielke also continues to bolster the belief some supporters had legitimate election-related grounds to lash out.

The restoration of the historic structure built around 1860 is part of a proposed development that also will feature more than 100 cottages, a cafe building, a restaurant/event space, outdoor dining areas, a vineyard, walking trails and other amenities. GALENA, Ill. — A Galena resident is suing the city and the developers of a major resort project, requesting that the court invalidate the City Council’s approval of a planned unit development and subsequent ordinances related to the endeavor. The lawsuit filed by Wendy Clark alleges that city officials failed to meet the requirements of city codes and state law in approving rezoning requests for The Parker project on the property that includes Galena Marine Hospital. It also argues that city officials did not adequately consider the impacts of the project on nearby residents when making their decisions. “We tried to encourage that to happen by participating in the process from the very first time we were allowed to do so,” said Clark, whose home is adjacent to the proposed development, in an interview with the Telegraph Herald on Tuesday. “That hasn’t happened, so this is the only option left.” The proposal first came before the city’s Zoning Board of Appeals in February. After multiple meetings this spring, City Council members last month approved an ordinance rezoning the property from limited agricultural to planned unit development, along with an ordinance formally annexing 56.2 acres of the 80-acre development that was located outside city limits. Those ordinances cleared the way for work to begin on the project. In addition to restoration of the Marine Hospital, The Parker will involve four construction phases culminating in more than 100 cottages, a café building, a restaurant/event space, outdoor dining areas, a vineyard, walking trails and other amenities. The lawsuit filed in Jo Daviess County Circuit Court names the city, project architect James Baranski and development groups True North Quality Homes and Bien Vie as defendants. Neither Baranski nor Sandra Lawrence, president of Bien Vie, responded to requests for comment Tuesday. City Administrator Mark Moran said the city had not yet been served with the lawsuit, so he could not comment on it.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Current conditions in Dubuque, IA A health worker administers a dose of COVID-19 vaccine during a vaccination clinic in Reading, Pa. COVID-19 vaccinations are at a critical juncture as companies test whether new approaches like combination shots or nasal drops can keep up with a mutating coronavirus — even though it’s not clear if changes are needed. Already, there’s public confusion about who should get a second booster now and who can wait. There’s also debate about whether pretty much everyone might need an extra dose in the fall. “I’m very concerned about booster fatigue” causing a loss of confidence in vaccines that still offer very strong protection against COVID-19’s worst outcomes, said Dr. Beth Bell, of the University of Washington, an adviser to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Despite shots’ success in preventing serious illness and death, there’s growing pressure to develop vaccines better at fending off milder infections, too — as well as options to counter scary variants. “We go through a fire drill it seems like every quarter, every three months or so” when another mutant causes frantic tests to determine if the shots are holding, Pfizer vaccine chief Kathrin Jansen told a recent meeting of the New York Academy of Sciences. Yet seeking improvements for the next round of vaccinations might seem like a luxury for U.S. families anxious to protect their littlest children — kids under 5 who are not yet eligible for a shot. Moderna’s Dr. Jacqueline Miller told The Associated Press that its application to give two low-dose shots to the youngest children would be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration “fairly soon.” Pfizer hasn’t yet reported data on a third dose of its extra-small shot for tots, after two didn’t prove strong enough. The original COVID-19 vaccines remain strongly protective against serious illness, hospitalization and death, especially after a booster dose, even against the most-contagious variants. Updating the vaccine recipe to match the latest variants is risky, because the next mutant could be completely unrelated. So companies are taking a cue from the flu vaccine, which offers protection against three or four different strains in one shot every year. Moderna and Pfizer are testing 2-in-1 COVID-19 protection that they hope to offer this fall. Each “bivalent” shot would mix the original, proven vaccine with an omicron-targeted version. Moderna has a hint the approach could work. It tested a combo shot that targeted the original version of the virus and an earlier variant named beta — and found vaccine recipients developed modest levels of antibodies capable of fighting not just beta but also newer mutants like omicron. Moderna now is testing its omicron-targeted bivalent candidate. But there’s a looming deadline. FDA’s Dr. Doran Fink said if any updated shots are to be given in the fall, the agency would have to decide on a recipe change by early summer. For the average person, two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine plus one booster — a total of three shots — “gets you set up” and ready for what might become an annual booster, said Dr. David Kimberlin, a CDC adviser from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. After that first booster, CDC data suggests an additional dose offers most people an incremental, temporary benefit. Why the emphasis on three shots? Vaccination triggers development of antibodies that can fend off coronavirus infection but naturally wane over time. The next line of defense: Memory cells that jump into action to make new virus-fighters if an infection sneaks in. Rockefeller University researchers found those memory cells become more potent and able to target more diverse versions of the virus after the third shot. Even if someone who’s vaccinated gets a mild infection, thanks to those memory cells “there’s still plenty of time to protect you against severe illness,” said Dr. Paul Offit, of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. But some people — those with severely weakened immune systems — need more doses up-front for a better chance at protection. And Americans 50 and older are being offered a second booster, following similar decisions by Israel and other countries that offer the extra shot to give older people a little more protection. The CDC is developing advice to help those eligible decide whether to get an extra shot now or wait. Among those who might want a second booster sooner are the elderly, people with health problems that make them particularly vulnerable, or who are at high risk of exposure from work or travel. It’s hard for a shot in the arm to form lots of virus-fighting antibodies inside the nose where the coronavirus latches on. But a nasal vaccine might offer a new strategy to prevent infections that disrupt people’s everyday lives even if they’re mild. “When I think about what would make me get a second booster, I actually would want to prevent infection,” said Dr. Grace Lee of Stanford University, who chairs CDC’s immunization advisory committee. “I think we need to do better.” Nasal vaccines are tricky to develop and it’s not clear how quickly any could become available. But several are in clinical trials globally. One in late-stage testing, manufactured by India’s Bharat Biotech, uses a chimpanzee cold virus to deliver a harmless copy of the coronavirus spike protein to the lining of the nose. “I certainly do not want to abandon the success we have had” with COVID-19 shots, said Dr. Michael Diamond of Washington University in St. Louis, who helped create the candidate that’s now licensed to Bharat. But “we’re going to have a difficult time stopping transmission with the current systemic vaccines,” Diamond added. “We have all learned that.” ISSN 2993-8384 (Online)ISSN 1041-293X (Print) Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers: Account processing issue - the email address may already exist Sign up with Thank you .

remind myself that the next time my grandpa and I go out for pancakes, he might not recognize me. I\'ve gotten used to the grimaces associated with telling people he has Lewy body dementia, a progressive disease responsible for the memory loss, hallucinations, confusion and mobility issues that have been consuming his existence since about 2017. But this is the grandfather who used to give me swirlies in the toilet as a toddler, has taken me to the Minnesota State Fair yearly since age 3, who insists on bringing his own taco sauce to every restaurant and won’t let up on his dream that the family sings the University of Minnesota ""rouser"" at his funeral. I am a granddaughter who is lucky to have grown up with such a devoted, albeit flawed, grandfather figure. I’m also part of a family struggling to know how to care for him. And at 24, I\'m also a journalist off in the world. Which is why reporting on a new dementia simulation house in Cedar Falls has been such a transformative experience. The 40-minute activity gave me the power to solve many of the mysteries about my grandpa\'s odd behavior — why he hunches over, close to the electric fireplace, making us wonder if he’s boiling alive; why he insists on wearing his robe around the house and nothing else; why at every opportunity to see his family all together, he retracts silently into the corner of the room. More: \'Change the culture of aging\': What you can learn about dementia inside a unique Cedar Falls house Simple compassion and contrast make it easy to understand the gist of these dramatic changes in a man who once relished in writing 1,200-word party itineraries. But going from a conceptual understanding of the disease to a more physical one, I learned about the little things I could be doing to make his day-to-day better — and what I\'ve unknowingly been doing to make it worse. I walked out of the simulation wondering why, as a curious and family-centric person, it took me so long to learn the basics about interacting with people who have dementia. Why didn’t I think to just Google it? The gerontology specialists who run the simulation told me that, often, people exit the experience in a cloud of realization about the ways their behavior could improve. I am one of those people. I\'m also one of the millions of people with a family member experiencing dementia in the United States. Alzheimer\'s, its most common form (and one I once believed was an entirely different disease), impacts an estimated 6.5 million across the country. Each one of those people will experience unique changes to their behavior and, hopefully, has someone in their life trying to understand why they are happening. To be clear, I decided to attend the dementia simulation recently as a reporter for the Iowa City Press-Citizen. In writing a news story about it, I drew upon the facts I gathered from interviews, research and my own eyes and ears. But reporters are people, too. Which is why I feel compelled to write about my family\'s experience, hoping to put the information I learned into context in the hope that doing so could help people with dementia. One of those people happens to be an eccentric 79-year-old named Allan Krejci. Grandpa\'s identity has been entwined with his Gophers football fandom since he was a kid in small-town Minnesota. I will never forget rolling my eyes as a teenager, watching him give a tearful salute to the Metrodome when we last beat our utmost rivals — the Iowa Hawkeyes — in 2014. He\'s also a predictably emotive person. So it\'s only natural that his outward pride that I chose to study journalism at the University of Minnesota, just like him, is somewhat unbearable. Waiting to hear if I had been named editor of the same college newspaper he once read with gusto, he made me swear I would call him before anyone else with the news. I did. His love for the university might explain why he so often asks me how things are going at school, typically several times during a 10-minute phone call. My go-to has been to gently remind him that I work full time in Iowa City. I graduated in 2020. I always include an ""It\'s OK, we all forget things; it doesn\'t matter,"" but that never seems capable of abating his stream of apologies. It turns out that correcting him is one of the things experts caution against. Rather than helping keep him in touch with reality, it just piles on the guilt and embarrassment, causing him to retract in fear of further shame. The added emotional stress and confusion it causes — because he knows he will soon forget again — drive up anxiety. More: Report: Up to 18% of adults over 60 have early stages of memory loss, cognitive problems I learned a simple formula: More confusion equals more anxiety. Increased anxiety, decreased cognition. It\'s like a Ferris wheel, except the kind you don\'t want to get on, and I kept buying him a ticket. It explains why he\'s so much better off when I ask him to tell me about his father and grandfather, newspapermen in Iowa and Minnesota, or when I ask him his thoughts on the ethics of meat production (one of our favorite topics, since he worked for three decades at Hormel Foods. He still insists chicken isn\'t meat). But when I ask him about the toppings he chose for his ice cream sundae the night before, he gets embarrassed because he doesn\'t remember. That circle of confusion is compounded by more than simple memory loss. My takeaway from the simulation, which alters three of the five senses, is that dementia is like living in a constant fog of physical and mental overstimulation. The overload to grandpa\'s five senses makes his daily experiences more distracting, confusing, frustrating and slow. But it doesn\'t mean he\'s not in there, looking for clarity. The appropriate metaphor might be listening to all 14 teams from the Big Ten Conference playing their rousers at the same time, and he\'s panicked just trying to pick out his own. The impact of dementia on grandpa\'s sight is probably especially persistent, given that I’ve watched him lose his sight gradually since I was about 10. But it wasn\'t until last week that I learned dementia disrupts the ability for the eyes and brain to communicate when they process the world together. It\'s why he might struggle when I talk and move at the same time, or get startled if I enter his personal space too quickly without a slow, faraway verbal introduction. That\'s all helpful information for me. It\'s frustrating to wonder why grandpa struggles to interact in some situations more than others. It might help explain why this year at Christmas, he and I kept up a conversation when I sat at his side, quietly explaining who was opening presents and when. In the safety of our one-on-one conversation, he could ask me which of his grandchildren was which, without guilt. But when we all sat down for dinner, he stared down at his plate of ham silently. He was rolling himself up like a stressed-out armadillo. So I recently asked him what it\'s like sitting at those big gatherings of people, the kind he once loved. He said he knows he gets stressed; he feels ""out of place,"" but doesn\'t know why. ""I feel like, I know there\'s something wrong with me. I don\'t feel like I\'m comfortable with all of those other people,"" he told me. More: Scientists are studying blood tests for dementia: \'A new era of diagnosis for Alzheimer\'s disease\' Better understanding the conditions that cause him to shut down — loud noises and movement, crowds, corrections when he gets confused — helps me know how to set him up for success. Throughout the past five years, we have watched him lose the ability to do most of his favorite activities: read the newspaper, watch a baseball game, decide where to go to eat. He naturally craves the activities he once loved. Which is why we still take him to restaurants, even though it clearly causes him stress. I assume this is a dichotomy many families go through: wondering what to cut out of his life and what to retain. I don’t pretend to have an answer, but explanation helps. As he’s continued to become less social, he’s still been unapologetically himself. Family photos confirm he\'s never been shy with his clothing; in the 1970s, he wore tight jumpsuits and 2-inch platform shoes; in the \'90s, Coogi sweaters and corduroys. As the guy who essentially created Minnesota\'s Spam Museum, he has always maintained an impressive array of merchandise in his closet (some of which I have been lucky to inherit). But it wasn’t until later in life that grandpa learned he loves'}]"

Biden told reporters later that he also brought up North Korea in the meeting. ""I\'ve made it clear to President Xi Jinping that I thought they had an obligation to attempt to make it clear to North Korea that they should not engage in long-range nuclear tests,"" Biden said, adding that if it did, the U.S. would have to take defensive actions. He notably did not say whether he and Xi came to any sort of an agreement on how to approach deterrence. Moving forward, both superpowers agreed regular talks were key. ""I\'m committed to keeping the lines of communications open between you and me personally, but also our governments across the board,"" Biden told Xi on Monday, emphasizing both countries share a responsibility to ""manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything ever to near conflict, and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation."" Biden and Xi\'s history: Biden aims to rekindle relationship with China’s Xi during summit in Indonesia China concerns: Biden to meet with China\'s Xi amid increasing tensions over trade, Taiwan Xi responded: ""The world has come to a crossroads. Where to go from here – this is a question that is not only on our mind but also on the mind of all countries. The world expects that China and the United States will properly handle the relationship."" Biden and Xi last met in 2017 in Davos, Switzerland, on one of Biden\'s final days as vice president. Since becoming president in 2021, Biden had spoken with Xi by phone video five times before their meeting Monday. Biden said he and Xi had a clear and candid conversation during the meeting, which was limited to the two presidents and their closest advisers. His administration said it viewed the meeting with China, which it considers the United States\' main economic rival, as an initial conversation between the leaders. Biden said at his news conference that both leaders agreed Secretary of State Antony Blinken would visit China to follow up on their discussions.'}]"

More: Parents feud in court after dogs maul 6-year-old son in Las Cruces ""Some kind of intent to let the dogs loose on anyone or command the dogs (is required),"" Stewart said. Information regarding the breed of the dogs or whether the dogs had been euthanized is unknown. The Sun-News has requested reports created by Animal Control but has not received them as of the publication of this article. Those reports typically focus on the animals, ordinance violations and include information such as breed and status of the dogs. Justin Garcia is a public safety reporter for the Las Cruces Sun-News.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 2:47 pm COON RAPIDS – Audubon became its own worst enemy in their Iowa Class 1A district quarterfinal game Saturday, July 2, against Stanton. The Wheelers’ struggle on defense was a huge factor in their 10-4 loss to the Vikings. Seven errors took their toll in the contest. The thing was, Audubon had things going their way in the early going against Stanton, the Corner Conference champions. After the first two Vikings reached base in the top of the first inning, starter Braden Wessel struck out the next two batters and coaxed a grounder to second. The Wheelers responded in their half of the first with three runs, as Aaron Olsen and Gavin Smith each reached on a hit and a walk, respectively, and then were sent into scoring position on a sacrifice fly. Gavin Larsen’s grounder scored Olsen while Smith came home on a Vikings error. Evan Alt later connected on a single to drive in Larsen and make it a 3-0 Wheeler lead. That’s how things stood until the fifth inning, when the Wheeler defense started to come apart. Three errors helped the Vikings score three runs, all but one of those unearned, and all of a sudden the momentum was starting to shift. The Wheelers briefly got the advantage back in the bottom of the fifth when Smith stole home during Larsen’s at-bat to make it 4-3. But four runs in the top of the sixth, aided by two hits and another Wheeler error, gave the Vikings a 7-4 lead, and they’d never trail again. A three-run double by Carter Johnson extended the lead in the seventh, and Johnson, in a relief role, slammed the door shut, a flyout to right sandwiching a pair of strikeouts. Saturday’s game brought to an end the careers of three seniors: Alex Foran, Smith and Wessel. Smith was among southwestern Iowa’s most successful athletes, claiming a pair of third-place finishes at the state track meet this past spring and leading the football team to an Iowa eight-man semifinal appearance at the UNI-Dome in Cedar Falls. Wessel and Foran were also successful multi-sport athletes. To reach Brian Rathjen, send correspondence to sports@ant-news.com or phone (712) 243-2624.

SWCC is working on a program that would increase education opportunities. (CNA ) The Iowa Department of Education lists teacher shortages in 21 different categories including mathematics, physical education, agriculture and social studies. Southwestern Community College Vice President of Instruction Lindsay Stoaks said, over the past year or more, several area school superintendents and principals have reached out to Southwestern administrators to express their concern about the teacher shortage. “Ensuring the college is meeting the needs of the region is a top priority,” she said. “Therefore, the college has implemented several strategies for the 2022-23 academic year to help address the teacher shortage.” The college is preparing an application to allow students who complete three of the college’s existing educational courses to qualify toward the paraprofessional generalist certification through the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners. If approved by the Iowa Department of Education, the paraprofessional generalist certification could be offered as soon as 2023. When the program is up and running, students who complete the courses introduction to education, exceptional learner and observation in teaching would be eligible to apply to the Iowa Board of Education Examiners for a PK-12 paraeducator generalist certificate. The applicants will be required to be at least 18 years old, have a high school diploma or equivalent and complete the background checks. “Many AEA’s and other community colleges across the state have offered the program; however, the recently-developed Teacher and Paraeducator Registered Apprenticeship (TPRA) grant program has led to the creation of additional paraeducator training opportunities across the state,” Stoaks said. “Several K-12 school districts in the college’s service area are participating in the TPRA grant program and the college looks forward to assisting with the instructional component of the apprenticeship program.” The certification is issued for a five-year term and may be renewed following the completion of three renewal credits and mandatory reporter training. “Students have had the opportunity to earn associate of arts degrees at Southwestern and transfer on to four-year institutions to earn a bachelor’s degree in education for many years,” Stoaks said. “Southwestern has a proud history of serving as a launching pad for many of the area’s current K-12 teachers. Over the past five years, Southwestern has consistently enrolled between 60 to 80 students in our education programs and that trend looks to continue for the fall of 2022.” The first strategy was the hire of a full-time education instructor. “The college recognized the need to have our full-time educator connecting with our local K-12s to identify and recruit prospective educators to Southwestern to complete their associate degree,” she said. In March, the Southwestern Board of Trustees approved the hire of a full-time education instructor, Salina Chesnut. Chesnut served as a kindergarten teacher in Creston for the past nine years. She earned her bachelor’s degree in elementary education from Grand Canyon University in 2012 and then a master’s degree in education from the University of Phoenix in 2016. “She is thoroughly excited to assist in building a pipeline of local students to help address the teacher shortage,” Stoaks said. In visiting with area K-12 administrators, Stoaks said research indicates a large percentage of K-12 educators teach within approximately 40 miles of their hometown. “With this concept in mind, SWCC administrators began working with area K-12 administrators to create and launch the teacher prep academy this fall.” The teacher prep academy gives high school students the chance to complete dual-credit coursework to prepare them to pursue degrees in education. These classes include introduction to education, exceptional learners, children’s literature and technology in the classroom. The program will also allow students to connect with an outstanding educator for observation-based courses. “Connecting high school students with an interest in education with an outstanding educator in the classroom is crucial for building a pipeline of educators,” Stoaks said. “The teacher prep academy will be rounded out with arts and sciences courses to assist students with meeting general education requirements upon transfer.” Stoaks is hopeful the teacher prep academy will be a high-retention pathway transitioning students full-time to complete their associate of arts degree at Southwestern and then transferring seamlessly to four-year colleges and universities. “Overall, we want the teacher prep academy to make education more accessible and affordable for students across the Region 14 area,” she said. “At the same time, it is equally important to note that anyone interested in pursuing a degree in education can come to Southwestern to get their start.” Originally from Wisconsin, Cheyenne has a journalism and political science degree from UW-Eau Claire and a passion for reading and learning. She lives in Creston with her husband and their two little dogs. Copyright © 2023 Creston News Advertiser. All rights reserved. Published in Creston, Iowa, USA, by Shaw Media.

No doubt Pompeo, a veteran of the House select committee on Benghazi, hoped to find something, anything to arraign Clinton. But again, in the end, there was zero, zilch, nada. Although the second review began with a July 31, 2019, notice from State officials that they “suspected” Clinton might be responsible for 12 classified “spillages,” they concluded nine weeks later that she did not “bear any individual culpability” for those incidents. Despite all the hysterical accusations that persist to this day, Hillary Clinton was innocent of jeopardizing national security. It now appears frighteningly obvious that Donald Trump is not. —— Joe Conason is a nationally syndicated columnist.
