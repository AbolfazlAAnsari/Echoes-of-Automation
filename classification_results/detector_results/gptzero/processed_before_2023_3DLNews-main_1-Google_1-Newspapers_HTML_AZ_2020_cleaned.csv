Janice Friebaum (center) with actor Alan Alda and park superintendent Judy Hart. Women’s suffrage will celebrate its centennial anniversary Aug. 18, but American women began their effort to win the right to vote long before 1920. Janice Friebaum had the opportunity to teach people that history while she was in college, and it’s something she still feels passionately about today. In 1982, the Women’s Rights National Historical Park opened in Seneca Falls, New York, the home of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott. Stanton and Mott are credited with organizing the first women’s rights convention there in 1848, where voting rights for women was first proposed publicly. The 72-year-long struggle between the 1848 convention and the ratification in 1920 of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution granting women the right to vote is a storied but bumpy one. It’s also a history with which Friebaum is very familiar. She was a park ranger for the National Park Service, and her job was to explain the history of the women’s rights movement to visitors. Now the vice president of the Phoenix Holocaust Association, Friebaum talked to Jewish News about her involvement in women’s history, an “unusual” park and why “it’s incumbent upon us to vote.” How did you come to be involved in this national historical moment? I was in college in Seneca Falls, New York at Eisenhower College. I was in my sophomore or junior year, and I proclaimed Women’s Studies as my minor. Because of that I was contacted by the National Park Service and asked if I had an interest in becoming one of the two first park rangers to be hired by the soon-to-be-opened Women’s Rights National Historical Park located in Seneca Falls. It was slated to be opened in the summer of 1982. It was established by an act of congress in 1980, and the reason for the park was to preserve sites associated with and to commemorate the first women’s rights convention in the U.S., which was quite a momentous thing historically. And it happened in downtown Seneca Falls of all places. There’s a whole cast of characters involved in creating and thinking up that convention and a whole tremendous story about what happened in the aftermath — including women’s right to vote being secured some 70-plus years later. What was it like to work there? I was there for the grand opening of the park, and that was a whole experience in and of itself. For a month or so we worked out of a barn — literally worked out of a barn. And it was in the summer, and it wasn’t air conditioned, and it was quite dreadful. We had a park superintendent, a park historian and a few rangers. We had a staff that was associated with the purchase and renovation of the home of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. We celebrated the completion of purchasing that home so it could become a national park service site and restored with a vintage look. Tours have been conducted there ever since. What do you remember about the grand opening? 5,000 people attended, and Alan Alda was the keynote speaker in the pouring rain. I was a 20-year-old and a huge fan, and I got to give him a tour of the home. He was invited, because he contributed the last $11,000 that was needed to purchase the home. He had been a very strong proponent of the Equal Rights Amendment, and that became a point of controversy about whether he would talk about that in his keynote address. Some people didn’t want him to do that, to turn it into something political. But he did talk about it quite a bit. What did you make of Seneca Falls being the location for this park? Downtown in Seneca Falls, the Wesleyan chapel was a popular place for all sorts of social reform movements, like abolition and temperance. Having the women’s rights convention there made sense. Through the years it became many different things and eventually it wound up as a laundromat, and I remember Alan Alda saying that he thought it was absolutely a symbol upon a symbol that the first women’s rights convention is now a laundromat. After a summer spent teaching this history, did you want to keep doing it? When the visitor center was completed, I worked again a second summer, after I graduated from college and before I started graduate school, as a ranger for the second season. The park is immensely changed now. Under normal circumstances — if you could go there now — they have a gorgeous visitor center with a beautiful theater. You know this history so well, it’s clear you could be a ranger there now. What does this place still mean to you? I’m personally motivated by people who act on their convictions — people who are not just armchair observers of social problems and injustices, but people who get up off the couch and do something about it. That motivates me tremendously. It’s kind of a beacon for me, and when you study history, you realize that the freedoms and the advantages that we enjoy today rest on the shoulders of people who came before us and had the courage and endurance and intelligence to make sacrifices of their own comfort, their own personal life, to benefit a greater number of people to contribute to causes bigger than themselves. It’s 100 years since women secured the right to vote. It’s very easy for people to glom onto Susan B. Anthony. A lot of people don’t know a whole lot more than her. But there are so many more things that happened before 1920 that enabled us to get to that point. I still feel passionately about this, because it all really boils down to the courage of these women who sat around at mahogany tables over tea and said, “We need to speak this out loud, and we need to call for these rights.” I take a lot of inspiration from looking at what people do under the circumstances they did then. It was a two to three day horse and carriage ride for most people to get to the convention. Here in Phoenix, a lot of people don’t attend anything if it’s 15 minutes away or more in a car. When you look at how low voter turnout is in our country, especially as the November election draws closer, do you want to tell people this history? As I’ve gotten older, I’ve learned when to save my breath. But I find it exasperating that people literally died to have the right to vote. When people don’t choose to exercise that right, it’s astonishing to me. When I hear about things going on that diminish people’s ability to vote with the issues around redistricting and voter ID, I pay close attention to that. Our right to vote is a tremendous hallmark of our democracy. We worked so hard in this country to give all citizens the right to participate in that democracy. It came at great cost to people over generations. I think it’s incumbent upon us to vote. Did your work at the park spark an interest in teaching that eventually led to your work with the Holocaust? I think what the experience with the National Park Service did for me was show me that I did enjoy being an instructor, an educator. I went on to be a park ranger at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park for three seasons right after working at Seneca Falls. I pursued graduate work in plant ecology. I have a really eclectic educational background. I taught people about flowers and trees and cultural history. I had a career in environmental conservation, and then in my late 30s I did additional work in Holocaust studies. I guess that teacher educator in me came back around. I started wending my way into Holocaust-related jobs or senior services. There was often an educator angle to them. What does this upcoming anniversary of the 19th amendment mean to you as someone who worked at this “unusual” park? Women’s suffrage was part of the feminist movement which still exists today. At its simplest and purest meaning, feminism is a belief that there should be equality for men and women period. Brilliant and simple. As such, Seneca Falls is really considered the birthplace of American feminism in the U.S., and there’s a feather in the cap of a not very well-known place where the women’s rights convention was the official beginning of the womens’ rights movement in this country. So when people say 1920 was when women got the right to vote, that misses the 70-plus years of struggle to get there.

Please give us a call at 928-428-2560 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Safford Mine Freeport-McMoRan’s latest predictions about the impact Safford mining operations would have on local water resources have turned out to be accurate and no adjustments will have to be made to their operations. That was the gist of Thursday’s 11th annual meeting to discuss the Safford mine’s 3M or Model, Monitor and Mitigate Program. Back in December 2007, Freeport-McMoRan Safford Inc. open the first major copper mine in Arizona since 1973 in Safford. Because of concerns over drought conditions, a ground model was created during the permitting process to predict the potential effects on local water resources, specifically the Gila River. Starting in 2002, a monitoring program was created and the company and the United States Geological Survey began gathering groundwater data several times a year in 2004. Over the last 11 years, FMSI and the USGS have been presenting their findings during a public meeting, although the USGS also posts the data on their website. According to the USGS, mining operations currently require about 5,000 acre-feet per year of groundwater, with a total estimated demand of 74,000 acre-feet of groundwater over the life of the mine operations. During Thursday’s meeting, which was held virtually, Conrad Parrish, the mine’s environmental manager, explained they monitor roughly 58 ground water wells between the mine and the Gila River, Bonita Creek and the San Carlos Apache reservation. Parrish told those participating in the meeting that the mine pumps 3,000 gallons of water per minute, which is roughly the equivalent of what an 800 acre cotton farm uses. He said the mine’s main water supply comes from what’s called the Fracture Zone Aquifer. It’s supplemented by the Lower Basin Fill Aquifer, which contains water that is not fit for humans or agriculture. No water from the Gila River is pumped to the mine, he said. The mine recycled 90 percent of the water they used in 2019 and the company is committed to protect the quality of ambient water, such as ground water and rain water, Parrish said. The model predicts that 42 years from now there could be a “slight decrease” of 251 acre-feet in tributary groundwater flow towards the Gila River, but Parrish and Tom Porter of the USGS said Freeport is voluntarily taking measures to mitigate that peak impact. In fact, according to Porter, the annual flow in the Gila River is expected to increase by at least 230 acre-feet. Currently, the 97-year annual median flow of the river is 121,000 acre feet.

Their son, Michael, grew up in Kyrene schools and graduated from Corona del Sol, later himself to travel along his mom’s educational pathway to become a PhD nuclear engineer. So their home in Pecan Grove Estates seemed the perfect environment in which to spend their future days in retirement, a time not far from becoming reality. Only a couple of problems: The area’s growing congestion, the summer heat, the increasing demands on the leisure time of friends and family—all formed the talking points for an ongoing discussion about the possibilities of relocating to, well, a better place. What emerged within the ensuing months was the couple’s decision to buy a home in Sedona, visit it regularly for the foreseeable future and then, when the time for retirement finally arrived, to move there permanently. And so it has been for a nearly a decade now. The couple commuted to the Village of Oak Creek for the first five years, home to their weekends-only visits, then to a rambling ranchstyle home with a breathtaking red-mountain view. Which is where they now live full time. So how have these past few years been? Have they missed the energy, convenience and big-city lifestyle they left behind? Moorehead has to pause a moment while he ponders an answer. “Well, we miss the Pollack discount movies, the quick and easy access to healthcare—and Yupha’s Thai restaurant.” He laughs. “Really, there are some things you just don’t ever get used to not having,” he admits. In the place of those familiar underpinnings, however, have come new favorites. “The friendly atmosphere of a small town, the pleasure of a slower lifestyle, the freedom from bumper-to-bumper freeway traffic, even the dark-sky rules that open a nightly panorama of star-studded heavens overhead. It was the latter, though, that seemed to provide the best glimpse of what is perhaps Sedona’s most inviting phenomenon: a sense of what both Moorehead and Exley see as an environment that wraps its residents in a blanket of communal beneficence, not to mention what they consider a oneness with nature. Moorehead became so enamored, in fact, of the area’s efforts to retain its natural beauty that soon after relocating he ventured out to several environmentally focused volunteer groups such as Keep Sedona Clean that works to minimize litter; another involved with reducing light and noise pollution; and yet another that helps guide Yavapai County’s future growth. In his resultingly limited spare time, Moorehead made new friendships, joined hiking groups, developed an interest in gems and minerals; even explored the remote, antiquity-laden hideaways that once had been home to the pre-Colombian Sinagua Indian tribe and its remarkable cave dwellings. Lynda, in the meantime, became an increasingly avid student of Sedona’s legendary vortexes, described as swirling centers of energy that are said to be conducive to healing, meditation and self-exploration. Like other devotees, she says she feels inspired, recharged and uplifted after experiencing the mysterious cosmic forces that are said to emanate from the red rocks. So much so, notes Moorehead, that they constructed a rock-encircled therapeutic garden in which they relax, meditate and ponder the wonders of their new world. A far cry, it goes without saying, from the bustle they left behind nearly a decade ago. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Quintero Citizens rally to remember George Floyd on the corner of U.S. Highway 491 and Metro Avenue on Wednesday in Gallup. Posted by Pauly Denetclaw | Jun 5, 2020 | CORONAVIRUS, News | GALLUP The high desert sun was scorching but that didn’t stop some 150 protesters from Gallup and surrounding areas from coming together last Wednesday to chant “Black lives matter!” And it also didn’t stop an armed group of civilians from turning out under the guise of protecting downtown businesses. The words “Black lives matter” have been heard around the world, and now in Gallup, New Mexico, since the murder of George Floyd on May 25 by four Minneapolis police officers who have all been charged and detained. This was Jordan Ortega’s first time attending a protest. “Since this whole incident with George Floyd happened, I’ve been very silent and passive,” said Ortega, 22. “I thought it was none of my business. It’s not my fight and I kept thinking if I don’t fight now, no one is going to fight now.” Her final push was thinking to herself, if George Floyd came to her and asked her to stand with him, to stand for him, what would she say? “I’d be, like, ‘Yes, I’m going to go out there. I’ll protest with the people and I’ll try to make this change happen,’” Ortega said. So she painted her mask with a Black power fist and the words “Black Lives Matter.” Then she stood alongside U.S. Highway 491 chanting, “No justice. No peace.” The Black Lives Matter movement was created in 2013 after the acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s murderer. Navajo Times | Ravonelle YazzieJordan Ortega, 22, participates during a Black Lives Matter protest on Wednesday afternoon that started on the north side of Gallup and ended in downtown Gallup. The mission, according to their website, is to “eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.” The Black Lives Matter protests are not just about George Floyd but all Black folks who lost their lives to police brutality and state-sanctioned violence. Despite making up just 13% of the U.S. population, African Americans make up 24% of those killed by police, according to reports by Mapping Police Violence. In the United States, African Americans are three times as likely to be killed by police as the population at large. Utah leads the nation with the highest per-capita killing of African Americans by police at a disproportionate rate of 9.2 percent. Last year, there were only 29 days where police did not kill someone. Hovering closeby during the protest were dozens of police officers and their units. All were wearing tactical gear. A caravan of police units stopped traffic for the marchers and followed them from the north side of Gallup to the courthouse where even more police were waiting. Downtown Gallup was a sea of protesters, police officers and what appeared to be members of a militia. Militia means a “military force that is raised from the civil population.” James Eby, the director of the Gallup Cultural Center and project director for the Southwest Indian Foundation, founded a group called True Patriot Foundation, which he described as “a veterans’ service nonprofit.” Members of the group were seen patrolling businesses with guns during the march last week. Those who were a part of his group, that he referred to as volunteers, carried “firearms – handguns to recreational spring rifles and hunting rifles and shotguns,” he said in a phone interview. Eby said he sees firearms as “a tool.” According to Eby, the group was prepared to fire their guns at people only if “absolutely necessary.” He added that the guns would be used “only in the instance of protecting a life.” A photo on social media showed people with guns and wearing tactical gear on the roofs of local businesses. “In an attempt to not only make protestors feel more welcome but also to ease the possibility of being called antagonistic, I instructed all volunteers who came to protect the businesses downtown to retreat into the business if protestors were within view,” Eby stated in an email. “All volunteers complied with this instruction and there was no interaction with the protestors and protectors as a whole.” Businesses downtown had heard about the protest and decided to board up windows to deter property damage and looting that was seen at protests in other cities. Gallup businesses invited Eby and his group, he said, but he declined to name the people in his group or the local businesses that invited him. Despite a heavy police presence and civilians with guns, Ortega and other protesters said they marched for change. “I know this is a hard topic to talk about, but we got to do it if we want change,” she said. “I had to get off my butt and go out there and make a difference if I want this world to be any better.” She saw online the photos and videos of Floyd’s murder. The images stuck with her. “My heart broke literally when I saw it,” Ortega said. “I thought it was unnecessary; he was already incapacitated. He already had his hands behind his back, and it was just unnecessary.” Navajo Times | Ravonelle YazziePeople participating in the Black Lives Matter protest walk across the bridge on U.S. Highway 491 in Gallup on Wednesday. Now there is a lingering fear for Ortega because a man died and “no one blinked an eye.” “It scared me to my core,” Ortega said. The police officer, Derek Chauvin, accused of murdering George Floyd, kneeled on his neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Two autopsy reports concluded it was a homicide but don’t agree on the cause of death. One report stated death was caused by cardiopulmonary arrest – sudden loss of blood flow due to heart failure. The other said it was caused by mechanical asphyxiation – not being able to breathe due to outside force. Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder on top of a third-degree murder charge and second-degree manslaughter with culpable negligence. The other three officers — Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane — who stood by as Floyd was murdered, are charged with aiding and abetting in the murder. All three were arrested on June 3. The charges against the officers were filed only after 150 cities across the United States saw an uprising and protests that demanded justice. With Ortega was her little brother, Joaquin Ortega, 17. “What I saw on my social media wasn’t right,” he said. Joaquin wanted to be a part of a movement that was bigger than him. This was also the first protest he’s ever attended. He was there to “see if I can make an impact,” he said. “See if we can change the world.” The Ortega siblings wanted to stand in solidarity with the Black community. “We’re here for you,” Joaquin said. “We stand behind you. We stand with you and we’ll fight for you.” Another young protester was 15-year-old Tyanna Begay. “Black lives do matter and everyone should take a stand,” Begay said. “If we don’t take a stand now the world will never change.” The video of Floyd’s murder went viral on social media and Begay, like others around the world, was a witness to what happened. “I was dripping in tears,” Begay said. “This is not the only time it has happened to an African American.

TURLOCK, CALIFORNIA.- Con el propósito de organizar actividades académicas, artístico- culturales y aumentar la presencia de la lengua española, de Latinoamérica, España y las culturas latinas en general… Creemos que de esta manera contribuimos a continuar viva este ejercicio literario, mantener activa la tradición de Día de Muertos y la continuación del español como lengua creativa, no solo como herramienta de comunicación y de enseñanza en esta parte del norte de California cada vez más creciente de hispanohablantes e hispanolectores. Covibodas, compras espectaculares online, negación del Covid, gentíos sin cubrebocas, pérdida de la noción del tiempo, pascua sin familias, contagios masivos de empleados, fin de los abrazos y la felicidad en los salones, mariachis y tacos para olvidar… todo esto produce el bicho raro!… —¡Socorro! Gritaban hombres y mujeres. Los gritos le pudieron mucho. Se les oía bajo tabiques, piedras, pilas de hierro. Estaban heridos o casi muertos. Empezó a ayudar, a levantar paredes, y a darles agua a muchos que no podían ni hablar. La mayoría eran mujeres con brazos rotos, piernas despegadas sangrando, cabezas con los sesos abiertos o quienes se sostenían el estómago para que no se saliera. POESÍA Por Manuel Murrieta Saldívar “Es posible que nunca sepa nada de tus huesos, de tu abrazo si me dejaste algo, un jazmín un beso un colibrí o al menos la sonrisa del café que estén tus pulmones destrozados congelados en algún frigorífico o recibas sin ritos ni ceremoniales las paladas de tierra bajo esa fosa común donde fue nuestro parque”… Ya empiezan a colarse en mi auto los deliciosos y diversos sabores de comida latina. Le envío un mensaje a Chima, sin ninguna esperanza de que me conteste, pues ya para entonces me imagino como debe de andar ocupado con este evento, preguntándole si conoce algún estacionamiento público en el área, y sigo buscando… finalmente y después de una media hora a vuelta de rueda tengo la fortuna de pasar exactamente frente a una persona que está saliendo en su auto, dejando libre un espacio donde apenas cabe mi auto, bajo de éste y camino dos bloques largos, y cada vez me voy metiendo más en la fiesta, porque es eso, una fiesta maravillosa, donde hermanada la gente y rompiendo con el ritmo diario de la realidad cotidiana se da oportunidad de mirarse uno al otro, de sonreírse, en ocasiones de saludarse con un movimiento de cabeza, así de pronto, como en los pueblos de Latinoamérica, donde todavía saludas a gente que ni conoces… Los poetas y promotores culturales Adela Castillo y José Alejandro Morán anuncian la ya tradicional “Noche Bohemia 2023”, de gran alcance, asistencia y participación en el área de la bahía, a celebrarse el sábado 26 de agosto en el auditorio Sherwood Hall, de Salinas, California.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:30 am Peggy Johnson: “My real motivation was just to keep a source of films here.” Peggy Johnson grew up loving film, but it wouldn’t be until after a 25-year career as a reporter with Arizona Public Media that she would helm the celebrated role she's known for today: executive director of The Loft Cinema. Johnson, who will be awarded with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Inside Tucson Business/Tucson Local Media Women of Influence awards on March 4, says she constantly went to the theater as a child, and as her parents were fans of watching television as well, movies surrounded her both in and out of the house. “There was really nothing else to do, so I watched everything,” Johnson said. “I feel like watching movies was part of me from the time I had consciousness.” In college, she was exposed to the art films of European icons like Federico Fellini, Ingmar Bergman and Jean-Luc Godard. This only increased when she returned to school to earn her master’s degree in media arts with an emphasis in film criticism from the University of Arizona. Johnson was a regular at The Loft long before it went up for sale in 2000. She was a fan of its left-field, artistic movies that she couldn’t see in any other theater, as well as its role and importance in the community. She purchased The Loft with a group of like-minded film enthusiasts and became the executive director in 2002. They quickly turned the theater from a privately held business into a nonprofit arts organization. While Johnson says it’s crucial for The Loft to interact with the community, going nonprofit was initially more a “strategy for survival.” “My major goal from the beginning was just keeping it going, because some of the plans had called for it to be bulldozed and eliminated from the Tucson landscape altogether,” Johnson said. “I really counted on the movies The Loft had; those were the movies I wanted to see, and I didn’t want to only have multiplexes to satisfy my movie needs. So my real motivation was just to keep a source of films here.” A mission-driven, membership-supported nonprofit arts organization since November 2002, The Loft Cinema's mission statement is now to create “community by celebrating the art and diversity of film.” “We changed the structure for how the programming worked and how the theater interacted with the community right off the bat,” Johnson said. Johnson recalls seeing the words “Grow Or Die” written at a seminar, and while she initially thought it to be overly dramatic, she now feels it’s an apt adage for running The Loft. “The existence of The Loft is really a credit to her hard work,” says Loft programming director Jeff Yanc. “Early on she saved it and helped it into a nonprofit and cultivate it. The Loft would not be here if she didn’t have that kind of passion. If people in Tucson like what The Loft is, they really owe a debt to her for having that vision early on.” Under her leadership, The Loft has spawned multiple film series to engage the community, such as First Friday Shorts, a monthly competition where local filmmakers submit their short films to be judged by a live audience; The Loft Jr., a free film series of family-friendly films with an emphasis on underserved families; Journalism On Screen, a series pairing films that explore the world of journalism with lively discussions with experts and industry professionals; and Science On Screen, which hosts thought-provoking movies paired with discussions by local scientists. “We’re all very aware of the pitfalls of programming for your own taste,” Johnson said. “We look at a lot of different indicators for quality… But we know we have an audience for all of these films, and make sure to inform our programming decisions on more than our own taste.” For instance, Johnson says she’s not particularly a fan of horror films—unless they’re very well made, of course. Despite this, The Loft has hosted a beloved “All-Nite Scream-O-Rama” for a decade, where attendees watch 12 hours of horror films from dusk ’til dawn. But most notably for local engagement, The Loft hosts their Community Partnerships series, where local nonprofits and other organizations “rent” a Loft screen to host events that “allow the groups to promote the understanding of specific issues and to raise funds and awareness.” The community engagements and growing reputation has, to say the least, worked out quite well for The Loft. The theater has operated in the black every year since 2005, making it one of the most successful art cinemas in the nation. The Loft’s revenue and membership numbers have also continually increased in recent years, and their fundraising revenue jumped from $643,776 in 2015 to $914,837 in 2019. Beyond financial expansion, Johnson also focuses on creating an open and positive employee culture. She says attaining The Loft’s current culture has been a central part of what she’s found so satisfying about working as executive director. “I’ve really tried to create an atmosphere of respect, loft marquee.jpg where people have their voices heard, and everybody feels empowered to say what they think and give their ideas,” Johnson said. “It’s been really important to me to foster that kind of culture.” Looking forward, Johnson and her fellow directors are planning to start a multi-part capital campaign to reach an “ultimate vision” for the Loft’s campus, which includes expanding the lobby, building new restrooms, becoming fully accessible to those with disabilities, increasing the size of the concession stand and adding two new screens. One of the new screens is planned to be added to the side of screen three, and the other new screen involves constructing a new roughly 150 seat theater between screen three and screen one with the ability to project 35 and 70 millimeter films. “We’ve grown in every conceivable way you can grow: we’re bigger, we have another screen, we have more parking, revenue grows every year almost, we grow in membership,” Johnson said. “And we have plans to continue to grow.” The Women of Influence awards, recognizing outstanding women in the community, is Wednesday, March 4, at Desert Diamond Casinos and Entertainment, 1100 W.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:41 am Horseshoe Trails Elementary School Principal Aaron Pettinato reads to a class of students. The school was recently named a 2020 National Blue Ribbon School. Horseshoe Trails Principal Aaron Pettinato feels the elementary school’s recognition as a 2020 National Blue Ribbon School was 16 years in the making. The award is a morale boost in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, reaffirming the hard work of many, he said. “This news could not have come at a better time for our school and district and, most importantly, our students and staff, just with how hard everyone has been working since really March—with crisis schooling, distance learning and now that we’re back in the building for in-person instruction,” Pettinato said. “These teachers, this award belongs to them as well as the students and families of our school.” Horseshoe Trails, in the Cave Creek Unified School District, is one of five Arizona schools to be honored by the Department of Education this year—announced by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. A ceremony will be held virtually on November 12 and November 13, honoring 317 public and 50 nonpublic schools. Plaques and flags will be sent by mail. The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program has recognized more 9,000 schools with nearly 10,000 awards over 38 years. Schools are eligible after five years, with up to 420 nominated each year by the top education officials in all states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Department of Defense Education Activity and the Bureau of Indian Education. Private schools are nominated by the Council for American Private Education. There are two performance categories: Exemplary High Performing Schools, which perform among the highest on state assessments or nationally normed tests, and Exemplary Achievement Gap Closing Schools, which perform among the highest in closing achievement gaps. Horseshoe Trails is an Exemplary High Performing School. Staff personalizes learning, Pettinato noted when asked what the school is doing to foster achievement. “What that means is that our teachers use best practices in the classroom for the implementation of personalized learning, flexible grouping of students, and differentiated instruction,” he explained. “And so what that looks like is, during math and literacy blocks, students rotate through stations, or they have a menu of activities and/or tasks that are differentiated to meet the needs of individual learners. So, our teachers practice natural reteaching of content to students who may struggle with the mastery of a concept.” And data-driven decision making is “at the heart of everything,” he said. “We gather data quite frequently from our students that informs basically what we do in the classroom, so we get to know their personal interests and backgrounds as well as their academic strengths and preferred approaches to learning,” he said. “The data collected basically informs our instructional decisions and groupings and makes targeted instruction possible in the classroom.” Pettinato attributes consistency in teachers, with little turnover, as one of the main reasons for Horseshoe Trails’ recognition. “We’ve got a veteran staff with very little turnover, they’re very experienced, responsive to student needs, and they just work extremely well with one another, whether they’re collaborating vertically or horizontally,” he said. “It’s a combination of just us really going the extra effort to personalize instruction, to meet the needs of all learners where they are, as well as just the fact that it kind of sets our school up for success when I don’t have to hire a bunch of new teachers each and every year.” He feels he “has the best staff in the world.” “I know most principals say this—it’s a cliché statement—but we really are like a family here at Horseshoe Trails. I think if you talk to students and families and teachers, that would be one of the first things to come out of their mouth as well.” For more information on the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program, visit ed.gov/nationalblueribbonschools.

Andrew and Glenn Edgerton are all smiles as they stand outside their home Wednesday afternoon. The father-and-son duo went viral in 2018 after Andrew posted a clip of Glenn complimenting him on his makeup. It was a fleeting familial moment, that’s all, a brief father-and-son exchange around the house that, even if freighted with significance, still came off as more whimsical than soul-bearing. There sat Andrew Edgerton in July of 2018, teenager and budding YouTube influencer, videotaping himself in his Flagstaff room doing another of his artistic, multi-hued eyeshadow tutorials for his followers. He was just about to daub more smoky magenta to the corner of his left eye when a gruff, but garrulous, voice interrupted from off camera. “That looks so freakin’ awesome.” Andrew looked toward the doorway and, with a giggle and flip of his eyeshadow applicator, gave a demure, “Thank you,” video still rolling. Then the moment passed. Glenn Edgerton, Andrew’s father, went back to whatever he was doing and, knowing Glenn, it probably was watching some game on TV. And Andrew went back to finish his session for his social-media followers. No big deal, right? Nothing to see here. Just another dad who loves his kid who happens to be gay and very much was into makeup at the time. Neither Glenn nor wife Stephanie had ever struggled to accept Andrew’s sexual orientation; they were just as interested in Andrew’s passions as they were with his kid brother Gabe’s interest in soccer. And yet, it turned out to be a big deal, bigger than either father or son could have imagined. After Andrew decided to post the video on Twitter — hey, he’s a member of Gen Z, so one’s life is always public and performative — with the message, “why is my dad the sweetest most supportive person ever im crying :’),” the clip went viral. In days, it garnered more than 70,000 comments and 300,000 likes, and the media picked it up. Yahoo News. The Huffington Post. Buzzfeed. Pride.com. They all did stories. News crews from channels 12 and 3 drove up from Phoenix for in-depth interviews. It became one of those feel-good, end-of-the-newscast pieces that was picked up and aired nationwide. Incredible, really, how a spontaneous 11-second clip could lead to 15 minutes of fame. The angle: a story of unconditional love between a straight father and his gay son. Now, two years later, amid Father’s Day and LBGTQ Pride Month, Glenn and Andrew no longer are social-media sensations — though Andrew still toils away as an influencer, Tik Tok now his medium of choice — but they are just as close as before and have seen their lives transform in small but meaningful ways. Andrew is 20 and an upperclassman at the University of Arizona. His foundation of parental support, buttressed by encouragement from his social-media community, has made it easier on him to be out on campus and advocate for gay, lesbian and transgender issues. And for Glenn, 48 and an associate clinical professor of athletic training at Norther Arizona University, having a gay son and being public about it has prompted him to advocate for LBGTQ issues, including serving on an advisory committee on civil rights for the National Athletic Trainers’ Association. The two say, in retrospect, they shouldn’t have been surprised that the video resulted in an outpouring of support. They say they are lucky, in many respects, to have the type of loving relationship in which acceptance is a given and support unceasing. “I’m super grateful for the way my dad and mom raised me and how they’ve always accepted me,” Andrew said, home from college this summer and sitting on the family’s front porch. “But I shouldn’t have to feel lucky. It should be this way for everybody. It’s so sad it’s not.” The makeup video episode has been an eye-opener for Glenn, who at first wondered why people were making such a fuss over loving your child regardless of sexual orientation and divergent interests. “I came to learn,” Glenn said, “that not everyone has a supportive parents, and they end up disowned. Or, the kid doesn’t even come out because they’re afraid they’ll lose the roof over their head. So they end up living two lives: one life away from the parents, and a straight life with their parents and constantly having to balance things. The more I think about it, the more I realize I had no idea about the plights of other people.” Consider Glenn educated now. What he always thought was encoded in every parent’s DNA — that they love their child no matter what — is far from universal. “This thing with Andrew and serving on this advisory committee has taught me a lot about all the disparities,” he said. “It made me look at what I have and what others don’t and what I can do to support people.” A professor, Glenn is accustomed to expressing views clearly and being verbally adept. But, in a wide-ranging conversation about his relationship with Andrew and about gay rights in general, he struggled at times to get to the heart of the matter. Eventually, he paused and zeroed in on what makes a good father. “Look, all your kid wants -- all Andrew wanted -- is to be loved and accepted,” he said. “Your kid doesn’t want you to become the world’s best advocate for the LBGTQ community or be on some board. Or want you to go on the news and say if you believe in homosexuality you’re going to hell. They don’t want that, either. They want someone they can come to and be who they are. They don’t want to fit into your box. They want to live in their own box. “I never thought about having a gay son. I never thought, ‘I hope he’s gay’ or ‘I hope he’s not gay.’ I never thought of what I’d do if he told me he was gay — until he did. And it was a pretty simple choice. Love him or not. I chose love.” Glenn admits he wasn’t always so enlightened about LBGTQ issues. He grew up mostly in the middle-class Long Island suburbs “in an era when being gay was a combination of ‘wrong’ and ‘funny,’” he said. As a young man, Glenn made jokes about gay people, stood by when other people picked on them. Glenn came from an athletic family and extended family in which no person identified as gay or lesbian — at least, openly — but also was not inculcated into thinking being a homosexual was wrong. “My family respected people as they were,” he said. “And I wasn’t religious growing up, so I never had a faith telling me (being gay) was a sin and you were going to hell.” It wasn’t until he attended Springfield College, in Massachusetts, where he studied athletic training and was exposed to athletes who were “out,” that the issue of different sexual orientations first reached Glenn’s consciousness. Still, it’s one thing to be tolerant of a lifestyle different from your own; it’s quite another to fully embrace your child’s sexual orientation. “When Andrew came out, I became someone who had to look at my lens differently,” he said. “We all grow up with biases, and Andrew coming out allowed me to become a better person.” The way Glenn sees it, there was no choice. He loves Andrew and Gabe, now 18, unconditionally. Many fathers, perhaps narcissistically, yearn to have their children share their interests, but Glenn was not one of those dads who pushed either of his kids into sports. Same with Stephanie, who played basketball in college'}]"
