prison died from suicide, homicide or accidents, according to a report released Thursday by the Justice Department\'s inspector general. The watchdog\'s report comes in the wake of several high-profile deaths in federal lockups in recent years, most notably the murder of Boston mobster James ""Whitey"" Bulger and the suicide of convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Those deaths put a spotlight on the long-standing failures and challenges within the federal Bureau of Prisons, a sprawling system that currently houses some 155,000 inmates across more than 100 facilities. ""Today\'s report identified numerous operational and managerial deficiencies, which created unsafe conditions prior to and at the time of a number of theses deaths,"" Inspector General Michael Horowitz said. The report examines four categories of non-medical deaths in the federal Bureau of Prisons, or BOP, between 2014 and 2021: suicide, homicide, accident and unknown factors (when there was not enough information to definitively determine the cause of death). Of the 344 inmate deaths the internal watchdog found over that time period, more than half of them — 187 — were suicides. Homicides were the next biggest category with 89, followed by 56 accidents and 12 unknown. Hanging was the most common cause of death, followed by drug overdose and blunt force trauma. The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois, said that Horowitz and BOP Director Collette Peters will appear before the panel on Feb. 28 for a hearing focused on deaths in the federal prison system. ""It is deeply disturbing that today\'s report found that the majority of BOP\'s non-medical deaths in custody could have been prevented or mitigated by greater compliance with BOP policy, better, staffing, and increased mental health and substance abuse treatment,"" Durbin said in a statement. ""Accountability across the Bureau is necessary and long overdue."" The report says that the BOP has policies in place to try to prevent inmate suicides, including identifying potentially suicidal inmates, managing medication and housing decisions. But it says that combination of both policy violations and operational failures contributed to the suicides. In many instances, it says, an inmate was inappropriately deemed to not be a suicide risk, only to then die by suicide. The report also found that more than half of the inmates who died by suicide were housed in a cell alone, which increases suicide risk. ""We also found that some institution staff failed to coordinate efforts across departments to provide necessary treatment or follow-up with inmates in distress and that staff did not sufficiently conduct required rounds or counts in over a third of the inmate suicides in our scope,"" the report said. It was a series of such failures that played a role in Epstein\'s suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan in 2019. The report says that several chronic, system-wide challenges were a factor in many of the documented inmate deaths. The BOP continues to grapple with a severe staffing shortage, which has a ripple effect across the agency\'s institutions. That forces guards to work overtime, which leads to exhaustion and negatively affects security. It also means that health care workers, including those that focus on mental health, often get pulled from their regular jobs to work shifts as guards. That translates into less mental health care for inmates. BOP facilities also continue to struggle to keep their facilities free of contraband drugs and weapons, which contributed to nearly 1 in 3 inmate deaths in the report. The report also points to problems with — or the lack of — security cameras. ""Although the BOP has taken some steps to being addressing these issues, the BOP must employ a comprehensive approach to address these chronic challenges and continue to prioritize corrective actions in these areas if it is to maintain a safe and secure environment for both staff and the inmates in its custody,"" the report says.

The raid came a day after the army sought to evacuate thousands of displaced people who had taken shelter at Nasser Hospital in the city of Khan Younis, the focus of Israel\'s offensive against Hamas in recent weeks. The war shows no sign of ending, and the risk of a broader conflict is growing as Israel and Lebanon\'s Hezbollah step up attacks after a particularly deadly exchange on Wednesday. The military said it had ""credible intelligence"" that Hamas had held hostages at the hospital and that the hostages\' remains might still be inside. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesperson, said forces were conducting a ""precise and limited"" operation there and would not forcibly evacuate medics or patients. Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals and other civilian structures to shield its fighters. A released hostage told The Associated Press last month that she and over two dozen other captives had been held in Nasser Hospital. International law prohibits the targeting of medical facilities, but they can lose those protections if they are used for military purposes. The troops were searching several hospital buildings after ordering all medical staff and patients to move into an older building in the compound, said Shaban Tabash, a nurse at the hospital. Doctors were unable to provide treatment to the patients in the building, which was not properly equipped. ""The situation of patients is difficult,"" Tabash told the AP. Separately, Israel launched airstrikes into southern Lebanon for a second day after killing 10 civilians and three Hezbollah fighters on Wednesday in response to a rocket attack that killed an Israeli soldier and wounded several others. It was the deadliest exchange of fire along the border since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Hezbollah — an ally of Hamas — have traded fire on a daily basis, raising the risks of a broader conflict. Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility for Wednesday\'s rocket attack. Sheikh Nabil Kaouk, a senior member of the group, said it is ""prepared for the possibility of expanding the war"" and would meet ""escalation with escalation, displacement with displacement, and destruction with destruction."" Negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza, meanwhile, appear to have stalled, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the offensive until Hamas is destroyed and scores of hostages taken during the militants\' Oct. 7 attack. Nasser Hospital has been the latest focus of Israeli military operations that have gutted Gaza\'s health sector as it struggles to treat a constant stream of people wounded in daily bombardments. Israeli troops, tanks and snipers have surrounded the hospital for at least a week, with heavy fire all around it. Several people have been killed inside the compound in recent days, according to health officials. Overnight, a strike slammed into one of the hospital\'s wards, and video showed medics scrambling to wheel patients on stretchers down a corridor filled with smoke or dust. A medic used a cellphone flashlight to illuminate a darkened room where a wounded man screamed in pain as gunfire echoed outside. The AP could not authenticate the video but the footage was consistent with its reporting. The strike killed one patient and wounded six others, all of whom were already being treated for previous wounds, Dr. Khaled Alserr, one of the remaining surgeons at Nasser Hospital, told the AP. ""The situation is escalating every hour and every minute,"" he said. Hours later, troops moved into the hospital compound, staff said. Footage posted online showed patients massed together in the old hospital building, with a row of beds lining a hallway. The international aid group Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French language acronym MSF, said its staff had to flee the hospital on Thursday, leaving patients behind, and that one staffer was detained at an Israeli checkpoint just outside the facility. The military had ordered the evacuation of Nasser Hospital and surrounding areas last month. But as with other health facilities, medics said patients were unable to safely leave or be relocated, and thousands of people displaced by fighting elsewhere remained there. ""People have been forced into an impossible situation,"" said Lisa Macheiner of MSF. ""Stay at Nasser Hospital against the Israeli military\'s orders and become a potential target or exit the compound into an apocalyptic landscape where bombings and evacuation orders are a part of daily life."" The war began when Hamas militants burst through Israel\'s formidable defenses on Oct. 7 and rampaged through several communities, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage. More than 100 of the captives were freed during a cease-fire last year in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. Around 130 captives remain in Gaza, a fourth of whom are believed to be dead. Netanyahu has come under intense pressure from families of the hostages and the wider public to make a deal to secure their freedom, but his far-right coalition partners could bring down his government if he is seen as being too soft on Hamas. Israel responded to the Oct. 7 attack by launching one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. Over 28,000 Palestinians have been killed, 80% of the population have fled their homes and a quarter are starving amid a worsening humanitarian catastrophe. Large areas in northern Gaza, the first target of the offensive, have been completely destroyed. Hamas has continued to attack Israeli forces in all parts of Gaza, and says it will not release all the remaining captives until Israel ends its offensive and withdraws. Hamas is also demanding the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including top militants. Netanyahu has rejected those demands, calling them ""delusional."" He says Israel will soon expand its offensive into Gaza\'s southernmost city of Rafah, on the Egyptian border. Over half of Gaza\'s population of 2.3 million has sought refuge in Rafah after fleeing fighting elsewhere in the coastal enclave. At least 28,663 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\'s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Over 68,000 people have been wounded in the war. Airstrikes late Wednesday in central Gaza killed at least 11 people, including four children and five women, according to hospital records. Relatives gathered around bodies wrapped in white shrouds outside Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah before the remains were placed in a truck to be taken for burial. One man struggled to let go, lying down and holding one of the bodies on the truck as he wept. Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.'}]"

Nikki Haley is making the case to potential donors in Texas that she\'s a viable alternative to Donald Trump. The effort comes with Haley trailing Trump by 35 points in South Carolina, where voters will submit primary ballots in a little over a week. CBS News campaign reporter Taurean Small has more.

Photo by Drew Angerer - Getty Images As the news business craters under dwindling audiences, slashed budgets and mass layoffs, journalists have taken to picket lines in protest. Over the past two years, they have gone on strike against their corporate owners in cities big and small, including New York, Los Angeles., Washington D.C., San Antonio, Naples, Fla., Rochester N.Y. and Pittsburgh. At the national level, the efforts have been led by a 36-year-old former data reporter for The Los Angeles Times who finds himself much in demand. ""They\'re desperate to do this work — to tell the stories that the folks in our communities want to hear,"" says Jon Schleuss, now the president of the NewsGuild-CWA. ""When you have corporations, hedge funds, the billionaire [owners] and then really bad management, they\'re looking around being like, \'What\'s going to happen? ... Who\'s going to be here?\'"" ""No one is going to be here unless we stand up and fight,"" he adds. Unionized workers in vibrant industries — from autoworkers to UPS drivers to pilots — have recently won double-digit pay raises and more say over their working conditions through collective bargaining. But in the ailing news business, are unions even strong enough to stem the bleeding of closures and layoffs? Schleuss grew up in rural Arkansas. The power and promise of labor held no appeal to him as a youth or a young journalist starting out there. ""I did not grow up in a union family,"" Schluess says. ""I didn\'t really grow up in a culture that even, you know, talked about unions. They just didn\'t even exist."" But at the L.A. Times, a famously anti-union paper then owned by Tribune media, he says the decision to unionize was born of necessity: Tribune sought to cut costs even more steeply than before by consolidating positions across its properties. ""We were facing a crisis moment where we had management constantly changing, very little job security, terrible pay inequity,"" Schleuss says. He found himself helping to establish the paper\'s first newsroom union. It won recognition in January 2018. The paper was sold shortly after to the billionaire surgeon, entrepreneur and philanthropist Patrick Soon-Shiong, who invested heavily in its reporting staff. The union\'s success in Los Angeles inspired a wave of labor activism among journalists. Schleuss rode that wave to win an election in 2019 to lead the NewsGuild, unseating a longtime guild activist who had been its president for 11 years. As the union\'s chief, Schleuss has adopted an aggressive stance. ""When we were organizing at the L.A. Times and building the union we never thought we would go on strike,"" Schleuss says. ""Now it\'s completely changed. We realized that withholding our labor is essential to making sure that the boss knows that we have a seat at the table and we have a voice and we have a lot of collective power."" Journalists at the Wall Street Journal\'s Washington bureau wore their union local\'s T-shirts and buttons earlier this month in protest of layoffs there, which included 17 reporters and 13 editors. The Journal\'s corporate parent, News Corp., subsequently reported its highest profits since 2007, the year it acquired the paper. A smaller number of related positions were created in other locations. On Feb. 1, scores of people turned out in Chicago for a protest outside the printing press for the Chicago Tribune, owned by the private investment fund Alden Global Capital. In 2021, it folded Tribune Media into its portfolio of approximately 200 papers, making it the nation\'s second biggest newspaper owner. Vanity Fair\'s Joe Pompeo dubbed Alden a ""vampire"" owner and ""the grim reaper of American newspapers."" This year\'s walk-out marked the first strike by journalists in the history of the Chicago Tribune. Others have done so at the New York Times, the Washington Post, the New York Daily News, Vanity Fair, Business Insider, and the non-profit San Antonio Report, among other properties. ""It brings people to the bargaining table,"" says Tribune investigative reporter Gregory Royal Pratt, a leader of the union\'s local chapter. ""Other papers that have had walkouts — from the Washington Post on down — you\'ve seen companies come back and negotiate in better faith."" ""This isn\'t something that companies want,"" he says. ""They don\'t want the disruptions."" That same day, employees at six other Alden-owned Tribune properties in Florida, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia also went on strike. Asked about the NewsGuild\'s labor activism at its papers, the chief operating officer of Alden\'s newspaper division simply pointed to one of the great challenges confronting the industry. ""We would hope the NewsGuild shares newspapers\' concerns about the valuable content created by its members being stolen by big tech companies and AI, enriching themselves while siphoning resources that could support local journalism,"" Guy Gilmore of Alden\'s MediaNews Group said to NPR in a statement. The walkout at The Washington Post may have helped to yield a better outcome there. ""We respect the rights of our Guild-covered employees and our work together over the past 90 years to reach agreements, like the one this past December that met the needs of both our employees and our business,"" Post spokeswoman Olivia Petersen said in a written statement. Last fall, the Post laid off about 10% of its staff. But the subsequent contract after months of bitter negotiations offered the first real raises in years. Yet in Pittsburgh, newsroom employees at The Post-Gazette went out on strike after a sharply divided vote in the fall of 2022. The owners, the Block family, have been intransigent. The strikers have won no concessions. Some have been publishing their stories to a guild-sponsored website. Alex Colvin, the dean of the school of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, says unions cannot stop the laws of physics. When cuts are on the way, he says, they\'ll probably happen. That said, intense union organizing can pay off, he argues. ""Unions can be effective in negotiating better layoff provisions, retraining, severance, whatever it may be,"" Colvin says. ""The question is, what\'s going to be the impact on the workers? [Are] there going to be any measures to soften the impact on them to do right by people who\'ve worked for a business for a long time? It is possible to have an impact by negotiations, reaching a deal."" At the L.A. Times, where Schleuss got his start as a labor activist, owner Soon-Shiong made deep cuts last June and again last month, saying he is losing tens of millions of dollars a year on the paper. He says the union\'s refusal to give him greater leeway in making job cuts in January forced him to lay off more journalists. He had offered buyouts in exchange for relaxing protections by seniority. The union instead went out on strike. Schleuss and local newsroom leaders dispute that. They say their public work action actually saved jobs and say the number cut, while draconian, was less than expected. In memos to staff, editors had said they went back to management and fought to preserve some jobs as essential. The strike occurred on the six-year anniversary of the vote in which the Los Angeles newsroom formally chose to unionize.

In New York City today, Judge Juan Merchan denied former President Donald Trump\'s motion to dismiss the 34 felony counts against him. These are felony counts that stem from hush money payments to an adult film actress back during the 2016 campaign. The judge also announced jury selection will begin March 25. Meanwhile, in Georgia, the Atlanta district attorney took the stand for some combative testimony as Trump and other co-defendants seek to disqualify her from the election interference case there. Well, NPR\'s Andrea Bernstein is tracking developments in New York, and WABE\'s Sam Gringlas is tracking the action in Atlanta. Andrea, I\'m going to let you kick us off. How did things go today in New York? ANDREA BERNSTEIN, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise. Just minutes after Trump entered the courtroom at 9:30 this morning, Judge Merchan told him that after conferring with a federal judge presiding over the January 6 criminal case in Washington, D.C., he - Merchan - was, quote, ""moving ahead to jury selection on March 25."" Trump\'s lawyer, Todd Blanche, stood up to say that was, quote, ""a grave injustice"" because there\'s still might be a trial in Florida for Trump\'s mishandling of classified documents in May. Blanche said this a day after he told a Florida judge that her trial date was not firm. All this clearly irked Judge Merchan, who said at one point to Blanche, stop interrupting me. In general, court rules in New York require defendants to attend in person, though that can sometimes be waived. Blanche argued that making Trump stand trial while also facing more trials and campaigning was unconstitutional. But nope, this trial is happening. It will begin in late March. It will go into mid-May. And Trump of all of us - and all of us will be in the criminal courtroom waiting for a jury to decide if he falsified business records in order to interfere with the outcome of the 2016 campaign while also a candidate in the 2024 campaign. KELLY: OK. So that timeline, you said it\'s going to start late March, go until mid-May, so I don\'t - six weeks or so? What are we expecting? BERNSTEIN: So first, jury selection, and there was a lot of back and forth on that today, with the defense saying it wanted to know if potential jurors were supporters of Trump or not. The prosecutor said, no, the issue was could jurors be fair? But Trump attorney Blanche said, quote, ""we can\'t ignore the elephant in the room. He is running for president. He was a Republican president for four years, and he is being tried by a Democratic district attorney."" So it seems from the get-go, jury selection will be contentious. And then there\'s a matter of evidence which centers on 11 checks Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. wrote to former Trump counsel Michael Cohen to reimburse him for hush money payments that were recorded falsely as a legal retainer. And if today is any indication, everything will be subject to dispute. The longer this case goes on, the more potential delay there is in all the other cases. KELLY: In all the other cases - speaking of them, Sam Gringlas, remind us what is behind this effort to get the Fulton County DA off of this Georgia case? SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Well, multiple defendants now, including Trump, are accusing DA Fani Willis of financially benefiting from their prosecution. And they point to her romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, a prosecutor she hired for the probe. They argue that the longer this case goes on, the more money he makes to fund their vacation travel. Fulton Superior Judge Scott McAfee will have to weigh all of this evidence and what case law says. But after hours of testimony today, Mary Louise, it is not clear what he might do. KELLY: What jumped out at you, watching all this today? GRINGLAS: This hearing really seesawed from tedious to combative. Right as lawyers were arguing over whether Willis could be even forced to take the stand, she appeared in the courtroom and declared that she wanted to testify, saying the motion to disqualify her is contrary to democracy. Multiple times, defense counsel implied Willis and Wade were being untruthful, and Willis outright accused the other side of lying. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FANI WILLIS: Let\'s be clear, \'cause you\'ve lied in this - just let me tell you which one you lied in - right here. I think you lied right here. No, no, no, no. This is the truth. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Judge... WILLIS: And it is a lie. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: We\'re going - all right. WILLIS: It is a lie. GRINGLAS: A lot of this hearing focused on a key question - when did Willis and Wade\'s relationship start? A former friend of Willis testified she had no doubt it began in 2019, before the Trump probe. That conflicts with what Wade and Willis has said. They maintained they didn\'t start dating until 2022. Wade even told the judge during his testimony that he had cancer during the pandemic and barely left his house during that time. Both said the romantic relationship ended last summer. KELLY: OK. But Sam, I want to focus on this question of financial benefit, because that seems key to figuring out whether Willis has a disqualifying conflict of interest. GRINGLAS: Right. A lot of scrutiny has been given to Willis and Wade\'s travel expenses. The two prosecutors say they roughly split the bills on their personal travel, with Willis reimbursing Wade in cash. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NATHAN WADE: If you\'ve ever spent any time with Miss Willis, you understand that she\'s a very independent, proud woman... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: I object. WADE: ...So she\'s going to insist that she carries her own weight. GRINGLAS: Defense attorneys seem skeptical of this without any records of bank deposits to back it up. And, Mary Louise, this question of expenses is really at the heart of this matter because it gets to whether there was a financial stake for Willis and Wade in the outcome of the case. KELLY: Gotcha. OK. So we wait to see whether Fani Willis will remain on the case or not. If she is disqualified, how would that affect the timing? GRINGLAS: Well, the window for the Georgia case to go to trial this year is already very narrow. And remember, that case is about Trump and his allies\' alleged effort to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia. If Judge McAfee disqualifies Willis, the whole office is disqualified. A special prosecutor has to be appointed. That could delay the case for months. And even if he doesn\'t disqualify Willis, appeals could still trip up the case. KELLY: Andrea - big picture - because you\'ve covered Trump and his businesses for forever. You\'ve covered so many trials. Just - as we look at this big chunk of the presidential race taking place with Trump spending a lot of time in courthouses, give us just the big picture on this moment. BERNSTEIN: The reality of that is really beginning to sink in. It really sunk in today. After a nearly a two-month trial in New York, there could be another two-month trial in Washington, bringing us right up to the conventions. It\'s worth remembering that all four of these cases are happening now because Trump\'s lawyers delayed them so much. But here we are. Trump\'s lawyer, Todd Blanche, said in the courtroom today, we strenuously object to what\'s happening in this courtroom, the fact that President Trump is going to now spend the next two months working on this trial instead of being out on the campaign trail. It shouldn\'t happen. But it\'s going to happen. KELLY: It\'s going to happen. NPR\'s Andrea Bernstein in New York. We also heard from WABE\'s Sam Gringlas in Atlanta. Thanks.

'HUMAN_ONLY', 'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Vice President Harris faces a daunting task this week: try to make the case to European leaders that America is an ally they can count on through thick and thin, despite some recent evidence to the contrary. In the past week, the Republican front-runner for the presidential race said he would give what sounded like a green light to Russia to attack NATO allies that don\'t boost military spending. Meanwhile, Republican leaders in the House of Representatives have all but nixed billions of dollars of aid that Ukraine needs to continue its fight against Moscow\'s invasion. Since taking office, President Biden has been telling his European counterparts that ""America is back"" as he has worked to shore up relationships tested by his isolationist predecessor. And Biden had promised U.S. backing to Ukraine for ""as long as it takes."" It falls to Harris — Biden\'s top emissary at this year\'s Munich Security Conference — to provide assurances, said former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. ""The key to our ability to be a world leader is not just our military power, not just our diplomatic power, but our credibility, our word,"" Panetta said in an interview with NPR. ""And if the United States can\'t back up its word in providing aid to Ukraine, Taiwan, Israel ... because of various conflicts here in Washington, it raises questions,"" Panetta said. It\'s against this backdrop of uncertainty that Harris will take the stage in Munich on Friday to make what\'s being billed as a major foreign policy speech where she will defend Biden\'s track record. Biden faced the same audience in Munich when he first took office — that year, the conference was virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic — and vowed he would chart a different course after the ""America First"" years of Donald Trump\'s presidency. ""One of President Biden\'s top priorities when he came into office was rebuilding and revitalizing the trans-Atlantic relationship,"" said Amanda Sloat, the former senior director for Europe on Biden\'s National Security Council, in an interview. Trump had slapped tariffs on allies, withdrew from the Paris climate accord, challenged NATO partners on their defense spending and defended Russian President Vladimir Putin despite U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian interference in American elections. When Russia invaded Ukraine two years ago, Biden marshaled a unified response from G7 and NATOpartners. He coordinated sweeping sanctions on Russia, sent more U.S. troops to the eastern flank of NATO, made an unprecedented visit to Kyiv in the midst of the war and sent billions of dollars in weapons and funding to Ukraine. ""The NATO alliance is bigger, stronger and more vital than it has been in 75 years — having just added Finland and about to add Sweden,"" Jake Sullivan, Biden\'s national security adviser, told reporters on Wednesday, noting partners had boosted their military spending too. Harris will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday while they are in Munich, the White House said. But European allies are nervous about the presidential election this November. Trump has tightened his grip on the Republican Party and exerted his influence on Republicans in Congress. Then came his comments last weekend, when he said Russia ought to ""do whatever the hell they want"" to allies that don\'t contribute their fair share to NATO. That rattled European leaders, said Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador who chaired the Munich Security Conference for years. ""Let me be very frank: I don\'t think that it is in the interest of America\'s European allies to see Donald Trump reelected,"" he told NPR. While Harris can make a strong case for Biden\'s actions, it\'s hard for her to answer what happens if she and Biden lose in November. ""The giant question in the room is, given the comments made by former President Trump, particularly over the last weekend — if Trump is reelected, will the commitment that Vice President Harris will certainly be articulating very forcefully, will that remain?"" said Stephen Flanagan, a Europe expert at the Rand Corp. who has worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Ischinger said Europeans are increasingly thinking about a Plan B — how to defend themselves if there\'s a future in which they cannot depend on the United States. But experts say that, realistically, Europe isn\'t prepared for that scenario anytime in the near future. There\'s a lot at stake for Harris herself in Munich too. She has spoken at the conference twice before, but this trip comes amid growing questions about Biden\'s age. If elected for a second term, Biden would be 82 on Inauguration Day. That puts more focus on Harris\' ability to step into the role, if the need arises. ""There\'s going to be more attention focused on the possibility of succession than there would be if you had presidential candidates on the two tickets who were in their 40s or 50s,"" said Joel Goldstein of Saint Louis University, a constitutional lawyer known for his expertise on the office of the vice presidency. Harris is newer to the diplomatic scene than many other Washington politicians. She was only a senator for four years before she became vice president but has worked to form relationships on the world stage the past few years, traveling to Africa, Asia, Central America, the Middle East and Europe. However, many of the administration\'s most difficult diplomatic negotiations have fallen to other key members of Biden\'s inner circle, such as Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who also will be in Munich. Harris will be watched closely, her meetings a sign of her command of the issues. ""She\'ll need to really step up to the plate in terms of the messages that she sends,"" said Rachel Rizzo of the Atlantic Council.

Over the past two years, they have gone on strike against their corporate owners in cities big and small, including New York, Los Angeles., Washington D.C., San Antonio, Naples, Fla., Rochester N.Y. and Pittsburgh. At the national level, the efforts have been led by a 36-year-old former data reporter for The Los Angeles Times who finds himself much in demand. ""They\'re desperate to do this work — to tell the stories that the folks in our communities want to hear,"" says Jon Schleuss, now the president of the NewsGuild-CWA. ""When you have corporations, hedge funds, the billionaire [owners] and then really bad management, they\'re looking around being like, \'What\'s going to happen? ... Who\'s going to be here?\'"" ""No one is going to be here unless we stand up and fight,"" he adds. Unionized workers in vibrant industries — from autoworkersto UPS drivers to pilots— have recently won double-digit pay raises and more say over their working conditions through collective bargaining. But in the ailing news business, are unions even strong enough to stem the bleeding of closures and layoffs? Schleuss grew up in rural Arkansas. The power and promise of labor held no appeal to him as a youth or a young journalist starting out there. ""I did not grow up in a union family,"" Schluess says. ""I didn\'t really grow up in a culture that even, you know, talked about unions. They just didn\'t even exist."" But at the L.A. Times, a famously anti-union paper then owned by Tribune media, he says the decision to unionize was born of necessity: Tribune sought to cut costs even more steeply than before by consolidating positions across its properties. ""We were facing a crisis moment where we had management constantly changing, very little job security, terrible pay inequity,"" Schleuss says. He found himself helping to establish the paper\'s first newsroom union. It won recognition in January 2018. The paper was sold shortly after to the billionaire surgeon, entrepreneur and philanthropist Patrick Soon-Shiong, who invested heavily in its reporting staff. The union\'s success in Los Angeles inspired a wave of labor activism among journalists. Schleuss rode that wave to win an election in 2019 to lead the NewsGuild, unseating a longtime guild activist who had been its president for 11 years. As the union\'s chief, Schleuss has adopted an aggressive stance. ""When we were organizing at the L.A. Times and building the union we never thought we would go on strike,"" Schleuss says. ""Now it\'s completely changed. We realized that withholding our labor is essential to making sure that the boss knows that we have a seat at the table and we have a voice and we have a lot of collective power."" Journalists at the Wall Street Journal\'s Washington bureau wore their union local\'s T-shirts and buttons earlier this month in protest of layoffs there, which included 17 reporters and 13 editors. The Journal\'s corporate parent, News Corp., subsequently reported its highest profits since 2007, the year it acquired the paper. A smaller number of related positions were created in other locations. On Feb. 1, scores of people turned out in Chicago for a protest outside the printing press for the Chicago Tribune, owned by the private investment fund Alden Global Capital. In 2021, it folded Tribune Media into its portfolio of approximately 200 papers, making it the nation\'s second biggest newspaper owner. Vanity Fair\'s Joe Pompeo dubbed Alden a ""vampire"" owner and ""the grim reaper of American newspapers."" This year\'s walk-out marked the first strike by journalists in the history of the Chicago Tribune. Others have done so at the New York Times, the Washington Post, the New York Daily News, Vanity Fair, Business Insider, and the non-profit San Antonio Report, among other properties. ""It brings people to the bargaining table,"" says Tribune investigative reporter Gregory Royal Pratt, a leader of the union\'s local chapter. ""Other papers that have had walkouts — from the Washington Post on down — you\'ve seen companies come back and negotiate in better faith."" ""This isn\'t something that companies want,"" he says. ""They don\'t want the disruptions."" That same day, employees at six other Alden-owned Tribune properties in Florida, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia also went on strike. Asked about the NewsGuild\'s labor activism at its papers, the chief operating officer of Alden\'s newspaper division simply pointed to one of the great challenges confronting the industry. ""We would hope the NewsGuild shares newspapers\' concerns about the valuable content created by its members being stolen by big tech companies and AI, enriching themselves while siphoning resources that could support local journalism,"" Guy Gilmore of Alden\'s MediaNews Group said to NPR in a statement. The walkout at The Washington Post may have helped to yield a better outcome there. ""We respect the rights of our Guild-covered employees and our work together over the past 90 years to reach agreements, like the one this past December that met the needs of both our employees and our business,"" Post spokeswoman Olivia Petersen said in a written statement. Last fall, the Post laid off about 10% of its staff. But the subsequent contract after months of bitter negotiations offered the first real raises in years. Yet in Pittsburgh, newsroom employees at The Post-Gazette went out on strike after a sharply divided vote in the fall of 2022. The owners, the Block family, have been intransigent. The strikers have won no concessions. Some have been publishing their stories to a guild-sponsored website. Alex Colvin, the dean of the school of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, says unions cannot stop the laws of physics. When cuts are on the way, he says, they\'ll probably happen. That said, intense union organizing can pay off, he argues. ""Unions can be effective in negotiating better layoff provisions, retraining, severance, whatever it may be,"" Colvin says. ""The question is, what\'s going to be the impact on the workers? [Are] there going to be any measures to soften the impact on them to do right by people who\'ve worked for a business for a long time? It is possible to have an impact by negotiations, reaching a deal."" At the L.A. Times, where Schleuss got his start as a labor activist, owner Soon-Shiong made deep cuts last June and again last month, saying he is losing tens of millions of dollars a year on the paper. He says the union\'s refusal to give him greater leeway in making job cuts in January forced him to lay off more journalists. He had offered buyouts in exchange for relaxing protections by seniority. The union instead went out on strike. Schleuss and local newsroom leaders dispute that. They say their public work action actually saved jobs and say the number cut, while draconian, was less than expected. In memos to staff, editors had said they went back to management and fought to preserve some jobs as essential. The strike occurred on the six-year anniversary of the vote in which the Los Angeles newsroom formally chose to unionize. Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.'}]"
