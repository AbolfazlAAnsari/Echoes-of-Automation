This hour-long documentary follows the team as they work in Dorchester and Talbot counties, uncovering artifacts that illuminate a chilling history of slavery and the lives of the enslaved in 19th century Maryland. Among the captivating discoveries is a dwelling believed to be the home of Ben Ross, the father of the American abolitionist hero Harriet Tubman. Now part of Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, the property once belonged to the enslaver Anthony Thompson. The excavation of Ross’s home provides insight into Tubman’s early years—and the harsh realities faced by those in bondage. Other sites featured in the program include another home on the Thompson property, where archaeologists uncover what is presumably an enslaved family’s “spirit bundle,” the slave quarters at Talbot County’s Wye Plantation, and the home of a doctor, his family, and their enslaved laborers in Cambridge. Ben’s Ten: Chattel Slavery on Maryland’s Eastern Shore is produced by Lynne Robinson of Black Robin Media for MPT in cooperation with the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Thursday admitted he mishandled communication around his treatment for prostate cancer and said he’d apologized to President Joe Biden, in his first news conference since returning to work. Austin said that he ""did not handle this right"" but emphasized that at no point was there a breakdown in the military chain of command. Austin, who entered the news conference with a visible limp, said that the news of his diagnosis ""shook"" him and his first instinct ""was to keep it private."" ""As a rule, I don\'t talk about conversations with my boss, but I can tell you I have apologized directly to President Biden. And I’ve told him that I’m deeply sorry for not letting him know immediately that I received a heavy diagnosis and was getting treatment,"" Austin said. ""And he has responded with a grace and warm heart that anyone who knows President Biden would expect."" Austin\'s unannounced hospitalization, which was not disclosed to the media or Biden and other senior administration officials for days, raised major questions about transparency and communications within the Biden administration. Republicans have been highly critical of how the Pentagon handled Austin’s illness and the House Armed Services Committee has called on the defense secretary to testify about the failure to notify key government leaders. Austin added that he ""never directed anyone to keep my January hospitalization from the White House."" Video above: House Panel asks Lloyd Austin to testify about hospitalization ""I was being treated for prostate cancer, the news shook me, and I know that it shakes so many others especially in a Black community,"" Austin said. ""Frankly, my first instinct was to keep it private. I don\'t think it\'s news that I\'m a pretty private guy, I never like burdening others with my problems. It’s just not my way. But I\'ve learned from this experience, taking this kind of job means losing some of the privacy that most of us expect. The American people have a right to know if their leaders are facing health challenges that might affect their ability to perform their duties even temporarily,"" Austin added. Austin last took questions from the media more than one month ago on Dec. 20 when he visited the USS Gerald R. Ford, an aircraft carrier operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Two days later after returning to the United States, Austin underwent surgery to treat prostate cancer, a procedure which required general anesthesia and an overnight stay. His surgery and hospital stay, as well as his diagnosis with prostate cancer in early-December, was not revealed to the president and to senior administration officials until after the New Year when he was hospitalized a second time for complications from the surgery. Video above: Lloyd Austin says he\'s \'still recovering\' Austin remained in the hospital for two weeks, leaving on Jan. 15. He then worked from home until this past Monday, when he returned to the Pentagon for a bilateral meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. At the time, Austin said, ""I feel good and recovering well, but still recovering."" Biden acknowledged earlier this month that Austin’s failure to notify him about his hospitalization was a lapse in judgment. Austin’s chief of staff, Kelly Magsamen, directed a 30-day review of the Pentagon’s processes and procedures for notifying senior national security leaders and the White House when the Defense secretary needs to transfer authorities to the deputy secretary, which was required during Austin’s hospitalization. The Defense Department Inspector General launched a separate investigation of whether the Pentagon had the appropriate policies in places to ensure an effective transfer or power and duties.
