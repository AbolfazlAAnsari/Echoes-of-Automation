MOSCOW — Valerie Mesenbrink never tires of seeing the confidence young men gain just by putting on a suit. A “psalm sing” attended by more than 150 people Wednesday in the Moscow City Hall parking lot led to three arrests, including that of Latah County Commission candidate Gabriel Rench. Rench, a Moscow Republican running against incumbent Moscow Democrat Tom Lamar in November’s election, was one of five people cited by Moscow police for suspicion of being in violation of Moscow’s mask/social distancing order, according to Moscow Police Chief James Fry. Of the five cited, two also were arrested for suspicion of resisting or obstructing an officer. The fifth, Rench, was arrested but not charged with allegedly refusing to identify himself to police, according to Fry. Fry said the officer who arrested Rench knew who he was but that Rench refused to provide his identification after the officer requested it. Fry said none of the five cited were wearing masks or social distancing. The five mask order citations were the first given by Moscow police, Fry said. The mask order took effect in early July and states face coverings must be worn in indoor and outdoor public settings where 6-foot social distancing cannot be maintained with nonhousehold members. Those who violate the order are subject to a misdemeanor, which carries a maximum punishment of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. Fry said officers preach community policing, “but at some point in time you have to enforce.” He said the department has been “very lenient” on enforcing the order and officers have tried to work with every group to prevent incidents like Wednesday’s from happening. The event was promoted on Christ Church’s Facebook page as a “flash psalm sing.” It started at 4:45 p.m. and most people had left within 30 minutes of it starting. Ben Zornes, a Christ Church pastor and organizer of the event, said the church hosts psalm, or hymn, events about once a month at places like Friendship Square, East City Park or at a house. He said Wednesday’s psalm sing was also a fitting way to show that residents want a return to normalcy in the face of COVID-19. “We wanted to make a statement we’re ready to head back to normal,” Zornes said. He said it is time to start pushing back against “largely groundless” laws — referencing the mask order — that are being passed and enforced without giving heed to what residents want. The Moscow City Council extended the mask order to Jan. 5 at Monday’s council meeting. About 40 people stood outside before and during the council meeting with signs protesting the order. Several people voiced their opposition to the council during the meeting when public comment was allowed and many voiced support and opposition to the order in emails to the mayor and council. City crews painted colorful circles in the city hall parking lot that event attendees could stand on to maintain proper social distancing Wednesday. Fry said the city knew about the event, which prompted the social distancing dots on the pavement, and that it would potentially include people without masks. The vast majority of the attendees — the majority of which Zornes said were Christ Church members — did not wear masks and most did not social distance. The group sang a few hymns and concluded with a doxology. Christ Church Pastor Doug Wilson warned attendees at the start of the event that they could be cited by police for not wearing a mask or social distancing. Zornes said police officers acted calmly and made it clear they were going to enforce the face mask order with arrests, saying officers flexed their muscles. He said he does not think arrests should have been made because of the attendees’ First Amendment rights. “We were just singing songs,” Zornes said. He said many residents are working to get a referendum in order to overturn the mask order. Garrett Cabeza can be reached at (208) 883-4631, or by email to gcabeza@dnews.com.

Cowlitz 2 Fire & Rescue Chief Dave LaFave said he first met Liliya Zagariya as he does most of the people working with his fire department — over a conversation at a table in the station’s break room. The 20-year-old’s positive attitude and big dreams to become a paramedic, despite the long and intensive path to get there, stood out to LaFave. Though she had only spent about eight months as a volunteer emergency medical technician with the department, she was quickly working her way into the Cowlitz 2 “family,” LaFave said. “Lily, in my conversations with her battalion chief and her company officer and other folks on the shift, had a very positive attitude toward folks and being involved,” LaFave said. “She liked to ride and be assigned to the shift. … She didn’t stand back. She actively participated as a member of the crew. She was really in that stage of developing into the family.” LaFave and several other Cowlitz 2 staff who worked with Zagariya attended her funeral service Tuesday evening, which was held at an undisclosed location at her family’s request. The department also lowered flags to half mast and shrouded their badges in honor of the fallen volunteer. Zagariya was killed Dec. 22 — just a few weeks before she would have started training at the fire academy program with Cowlitz 2 — in an apparently random shooting at a medical building north of PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center in Vancouver. She was working as a concierge at the medical office when 58-year-old Vancouver resident Douglas Moore walked into the lobby, shot her in the chest and then turned the weapon on himself. The Vancouver Columbian reported Monday that court documents show that Moore had confronted another employee about his appointment time just a few minutes before the shooting. The court documents cite evidence of first-degree murder, according to the Columbian. “A lot of people are asking why this happened to this person, myself included,” said Lt. Bryan Ditterick, who worked “more than a handful of shifts” with Zagariya. “She was always eager to learn. She just had a great smile and was always helpful on scene. She was a new EMT, too, and she was certainly gearing up to get more experience. She was enrolled in our program ... coming up on (Jan. 7).” Zagariya earned her national EMT certification in January 2020 and, five months later, signed up to volunteer with Cowlitz 2. LaFave said she told him that she chose the Longview program, a nearly 40-minute drive from her home in Vancouver, because one of her friends who was already a member of the fire district spoke highly of its programs. “She and one of her best friends joined together, so they had an interest in the fire service. I think they were involved possibly in the fire science program in the Clark County or Portland area, and they were in effect recruited by one of our members,” LaFave said. The volunteer program requires the same training as a career firefighter, so Zagariya and the other volunteers must “really commit a lot of time and effort.” “It’s really an avocation. It’s a second job,” LaFave said. Zagariya worked at least eight 12- to 24-hour shifts on the “Bravo Shift,” and she was in good standing for all of the other requirements to enter the fire academy. Noting that 80% of the calls the department responds to are emergency medical calls, LaFave said Zagariya also had the advantage of already holding her EMT credentials. “Frankly her desire to be involved and to further her training and education towards a career in the fire service is a fairly typical (reason) for what draws people here. But not all have an interest in going on to become a paramedic,” LaFave said. “That takes more training and education, and in effect, sacrifice. But that was what she said was one of her interest, to keep continuing to improve her skills.” Zagariya had a “service heart” and a positive attitude that showed while she was on shift responding to emergency calls. She had begun to integrate herself into the crew, which tends to be a “pretty tight knit group ... and family-like” because crew members spend so much time together. “With Lily, I look at it like this is first of all obviously very tragic. We were all in the process of getting to know her better,” LaFave said. “I try to remind myself that we don’t really get to decide at times the quantity of life we get to have, but we can certainly try to make sure the time we do have is quality time. And I do know this: While her time with us was somewhat brief, it was quality time.” Liliya Zagariya's friends and family have set up a GoFundMe account to raise money for Zagariya's funeral.
