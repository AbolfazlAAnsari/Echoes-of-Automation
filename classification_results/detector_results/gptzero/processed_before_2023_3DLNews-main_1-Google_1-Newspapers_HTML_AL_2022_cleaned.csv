Each year, the state issues report cards for every school with a score calculated based on the success or failure of a school. McKenzie Principal Miles Brown said he believes the value his students place on education comes from home. “The parents care about their education,” Brown said. “We’re blessed with some of the best parents you could ask for.” The community is always willing to do whatever it takes to help the students improve, Brown added. Though McKenzie may be a small, rural school with 450 total students, the school radiates a family-like atmosphere. “The people in our community believe in hard work,” Brown said. And this belief is something they pass down to their children and grandchildren. Bridget Cook, who has been the Instructional Coach for the last two years, commended Brown’s efforts. “Mr. Brown has such a good rapport with the parents, that if he called them, they would leave work to come,” Bridget said. Wanda Buckelew, who teaches English to eighth-12th-grade students, has seen many changes in her 12 years at McKenzie School. “Sometimes you have to show them their potential,” Buckelew said. “You have to challenge them in the classroom. When things are hard, you can’t let them give up. You have to keep pushing them.” Patti Cook, who teaches the entire sixth-grade class, said all faculty members are involved in the collective efforts to help children achieve success.. “It’s a love of helping a child be all they can be and the child buying into that,” Patti said. Brown said even coaches have gotten on board to help the students. “Just having that love and that passion for children, wanting to see a child grow, wanting to see a child do better and seeing the potential in a child, even when they don’t see it themselves, is the secret sauce,” Brown said. “It’s what our teachers do here.” And that seems to be the key to McKenzie’s success. The teachers make a point of telling the students that they can do it, and the children take ownership of their education and their grades. The school tests the students every month to make sure the child is where they need to be as far as progress – a tactic that has been especially important during the pandemic. Brown said his school’s data went up during the shutdown with COVID-19, while everyone else’s went down. “When your student data becomes physical and emotional, it becomes real,” Brown stressed. Teachers working together with administration seems to be working for them, too. “Everyone has to be on board for this kind of plan,” Brown said. But the plan is not as simple as it seems. Every other day or so, Bridget looks at the data, and if it needs improvement, she coaches the teachers, and they come up with a plan to ensure that the students are getting what they need. “I think the recipe is teacher commitment, parental commitment, and the student commitment,” Bridget said. All three aspects working in tandem is what makes a school a success. “The school was great before we got here, and it’ll be great when we’re gone,” Brown said.'}]"

The newspaper moved from its longtime headquarters on Government Street to its new building on Water Street in 2002. the paper is the highligh of my day. this is really hard to believe .i am 81 years old and have been reading the paper since forever. as a child my parents use to take a paper. i even use to read the register and the press every day. sitting i front of a computer for the length of time it take to read all of the paper is something i am not looking forward to. i guess all i can say is i enjoyed it while it lasted. this is so unbelieveable and shocking to me. Terririible news! There’s many of us that like to relax & read a newspaper! We look at our computers & phones Too Muxh!! Big mistake! I’ll be stopping after the New Year. How much will the subscription cost be reduced for all digital? If it is the same, I am gone (after 39 years). you will need to contact them for that answer. We took the ‘evening paper.’ Daddy gave us, my brother & me) the “funny papers” (Dick Tracy, Alley Oop, Dag Wood etc.) learned to read BETTER doing that. I’m 75 living in FL. Thank God and Greyhound she is gone. There is no room in Alabama for anti-South bigoted newspapers. The fake news lack of knowledge of history and the Constitution can only be outdone by the amount of hatred they can generate among Americans of all backgrounds. I guess it makes for headlines. If you hate Southerners so much then move north of the Mason-Dixon line and stay there. We are proud of our Confederate Ancestors and their fight for the 10th Amendment or States’ Rights. We are proud of their fight for independence and freedom. General George Washington and his men were called traitors and REBELS and General Robert E Lee and his men were proud to be called the same as they fought for independence and freedom. God Bless Dixie Great! About time. This company only hires scalawags, carpetbaggers, or just plain yankees that hate all things Southern. Thank God and Greyhound they are gone. It is truly a shame to see the end of our local newspaper.I see on different websites all of the ignorant,bigoted,and absurd comments about the paper but I guess with all of the brainwashing,disinformation,and propaganda against every one of the legitimate media sources and all of our countries institutions it is to be expected.The increase in the false so called facts,paranoia,conspiracy theories,and outright lies ,the constant drumbeat of hate and division of people is sending us down a dangerous slope to a fascist authoritarian state.I know all of the Maga crowd will never have enough proof of what a slime ball their orange messiah is because they only listen to and accept as true what they hear or see on these far right propaganda outlets.I had a paper route in the 1960’s and my father had a huge route ran or shine,hot or cold twice a day and on Sunday to help support a family of 11.He was presented an award in 1936 for an outstanding carrier.Good bye to an old friend and a way of life that I have known all of my life. All I can do I cry! I need this paper so bad 😞 Rest In Peace. Sad, but not surprised. Rest In Peace Mobile Register. I stoped buying them a long time ago, glad to see it go. Editorials always slanted against conservatives and Southern history. Most College’s are cranking out reporters that are activist not reporters and promote lies, anti God values, woke, and trying to rewrite history to suite their Liberal agendas. Im going to say it since they won’t admit to it, we God fearing Conservatives quit buying their garbage. It amazes me that people won’t research the facts and just walk lock step but, that’s Liberals for you. Good Riddance. I have to admit that when The Alabama Media group took over the paper it became less than it was.But to see all of the bigoted,narrow minded comments just shows how the MAGA CULT stays with the script and follows in lockstep with the propaganda outlets,use no common sense and refuse to accept proven facts.They call themselves GOD fearing but are nothing but a bunch of bible thumping hypocrites if they have any religion at all.To call the original paper liberal is absurd in the least but shows how ignorant many of the population have become.They never fail to miss a chance to find anything to make a mountain out of a molehill with no regard to PROVEN FACTS.It is disturbing to see how these people that consider themselves good people spew so much hate and division and show total disrespect for all established institutions.'}]"

The event began with a selection of Christmas carols and hymns being played by an ensemble of local low brass musicians. The phenomenon known as Tuba Christmas was established by tuba player and music professor Harvey Phillips in New York 1974 in an effort to bring more interest to the tuba as a versatile solo instrument. It has spread and is now celebrated in cities nationwide, including Gadsden. Southside High School Band Director Matt Weaver conducted the group, which was comprised of band students from several local high schools, professional musicians and amateurs of all ages. They treated the crowd to Christmas classics like “Joy to the World,” “The First Noel,” “Star of Wonder” and “Silent Night.” Weaver then invited children in the crowd to come forward to add a vocal accompaniment to “Jingle Bells.” After the concert, City of Gadsden Mayor Craig Ford came forward to announce the lighting of the city’s holiday tree, a large evergreen overlooking the Coosa River from next to City Hall. He counted down from five — with help of 6-year-old John Jones Elementary student Eliza Smith, who is the granddaughter of Gadsden Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Director Ruth Moffatt — and the surrounding trees were lit with colorful lights. The tree-lighting ceremony was immediately followed by a Christmas boat parade floating down the Coosa. Rainbow City held its own tree lighting on Tuesday, December 6, featuring gospel quartet Gold City and the Joyful Juniors children’s choir. The choir opened the ceremony with fun songs like “You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch” and “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” before yielding the spotlight to Gold City, who performed a few traditional hymns and Christmas carols. The event hosted several food trucks and offered pictures with Santa inside City Hall. Southside and Etowah County held their respective tree lightings on November 28.

Stitt’s affinity for Southern ingredients comes from his roots in rural Alabama. He trained at renowned restaurants and wineries in San Francisco, the south of France, Paris and Florence. When it was time for his own restaurant, he came home to Alabama and opened Highlands Bar & Grill on Birmingham’s Southside. He later followed with Bottega and Chez Fonfon. Stitt is a leading champion of sustainable agriculture and humane animal husbandry. He is the author of the award-winning books “Frank Stitt’s Southern Table,” and “Frank Stitt’s Bottega Favorita.” In 2018, Highlands Bar & Grill received the James Beard Foundation Award for Outstanding Restaurant. Stitt previously received the foundation’s award for Best Chef: Southeast in 2001 and was nominated in 2008 for Outstanding Chef. He also received the Horst H. Schulze Award for Excellence in Hospitality from Auburn University in 2017. Terry also is renowned for his activism to create a healthy, just and sustainable food system.

State Department of Education Education Specialist Kristie Shankles Ozark City Schools Superintendent Reeivice Girtman Daleville City Schools Superintendent Dr. Lisa Stamps Daleville and Ozark city school systems announced their partnerships with the Alabama State Department in each becoming a Multi-Tier System of Supports school district. Educators, board of education members, and elected officials joined representatives from the State Department of Education at news conferences held separately in Daleville and Ozark Monday. Daleville and Ozark school systems are among 33 school systems to be selected out of 138 across the state for the initiative that began last year as a pilot program with five schools. By the year 2027, every school system in the state will have MTSS partner schools, said Kristie Shankles, an education specialist with the State Department of Education. Shankles introduced MTSS Regional Coach Angie Stewart, who will be assisting Daleville City Schools, and MTSS Reginal Coach Andrea Beall, who will be the designated coach for Ozark City Schools. MTSS is a framework that helps educators provide academic and behavioral strategies for students with various needs, Shankles said. “At a glance, MTSS is an opportunity for us to give our students the absolute best chance to succeed.” Shankles said that the state department of education is making a five to eight year commitment for support with participating school systems and that there is no cost to the school systems to participate. “This distinction reflects the endless hours the district and building-based employees have spent and will spend securing measures for our students to be successful,” she said. “It’s about providing multi-level support to the whole child, the whole community, and the whole school system,” said Ozark City Schools Superintendent Reeivice Girtman. “I realize how important this process is. It’s important for us to do it right.” “What we’re doing is based on tried-and-true research-based instructional strategies,” said Daleville City Schools Superintendent Dr. Lisa Stamps. “MTSS is a gigantic umbrella and we’re going to make sure we look at the whole child.” What some call “soft skills” Stamps said is called “character traits” in Daleville City Schools. “We focus on character all the way up but especially at the elementary school level.” “It takes all of us working together,” said Girtman. “Ozark does indeed need everyone to provide our students and our community with the best educational services possible.” “This is the official kickoff,” said Beall. “MTSS is not just for certain students. It is for all students. It truly means all. We’ll really start to dive into how we make sure that every single student is getting what they need to succeed every day.” “Another component is recognizing the importance of our parents and developing that partnership,” said Shankles. “By bringing everyone to the table we can insure that every child has the opportunity to succeed.” Get local news delivered to your inbox!

House Speaker Mac McCutcheon, R-Monrovia, said Thursday there was a “good chance” that bills to allow permitless carry of pistols in the state and another to change the definition of rioting would come out for floor votes. “There comes a point where there are certain bills that have a lot of debate and a lot of controversy,” he said. “And sometimes it’s just better to get those bills on the counter and have a date.” The votes could take place as early as Tuesday, McCutcheon said. Both bills are priority legislation for the House GOP caucus and are likely to pass. But both pieces of legislation have drawn strong opposition. State law currently defines the crime of riot as when a person with five or more people “wrongfully engages in tumultuous and violent conduct and thereby intentionally or recklessly causes or creates a grave risk of public terror or alarm.” HB 2, sponsored by Rep. Allen Treadaway, R-Birmingham, a retired assistant police chief in Birmingham, would change the definition to “engaging in conduct which creates an immediate danger of and/or damage to property or injury to persons.” It would also allow police to hold those arrested on charges of riot for 24 hours, and require those convicted of the charge to be held for a minimum of 30 days. Treadaway has argued in the committee that the bill would protect police and peaceful protestors. Opponents say the bill’s definitions are too broad and could lead to restrictions on peaceful protest. “HB2's outrageously vague definition of ‘riot’ and wide latitude for law enforcement to target small groups of protesters — as well as their supporters — for arrest under this proposed law is an unconstitutional and racist attack on our civil liberties,” Kathleen Kirkpatrick, a director of Hometown Action, a political activist group, said in a statement.” The House scheduled a vote on Treadaway’s bill on Wednesday night. But leadership delayed action amid the threat of a filibuster from House Democrats. A message seeking comment was left with House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville, on Friday. HB272, sponsored by Rep. Shane Stringer, R-Citronelle, would allow gun owners to carry concealed pistols on their bodies without a permit. The bill would keep existing limitations on where pistols can be carried and would not get rid of permits generally, but would do away with legal penalties for carrying a concealed weapon on a person, or a loaded firearm within arm’s reach in a car. Gun access groups have supported such bills in recent years, arguing permits are an infringement on the right to own a weapon. But the legislation has failed to get traction in the Alabama House in recent years. McCutcheon said Thursday the development of a database accessible by law enforcement to determine who should and should not have a gun had improved its prospects. “Law enforcement is going to have a tool that will be a better tool for public safety and the safety of the officer themselves to check people to have weapons on them,” he said. “Well, with that in mind, then the question is ‘well, is the pistol permit something that’s necessary?’ ” Law enforcement groups, particularly sheriffs, say yes. They argue the permit requirement gives officers at traffic stops the ability to detain individuals who may have committed more serious crimes. “We know that those individuals (with permits) have had a background check and they are safe enough to carry a gun,” said Mark Pettway, the Jefferson County Sheriff.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 3:59 pm Northeast Alabama Community College announced the creation of the Mustang Gaming Esports Club to give students the opportunity to participate in Esports and compete against other college students in Alabama and beyond. Esports is a growing sport and the Esports industry is currently a multi-billion dollar industry. There are many opportunities for work and play within the industry. The concept is no different from any other sport. Students work together to practice and compete as a team. Teams typically vary in size from 2-5 players with some opportunities for one-on-one competitions. “We are very pleased to get Esports going at Northeast,” stated NACC President Dr. David Campbell. “I thank Mrs. Patricia Falk, Mrs. Barbara Kilgore, Mr. Bryon Miller, Mr. Noah Allen, Mr. Lee Garrett, Mr. Kyle Ealy and all our staff for putting this together for us. Northeast prides itself on having the best in educational technology and this affirms what we have available and how much we emphasize educational technology. Esports is very popular and a rapidly growing sport. Some major companies even consider gaming levels in hiring decisions. Gaming takes long and short-term strategy, creative and critical thinking, and quick decision making to be successful. All the challenges of innovative and high-level thinking are there. We are excited about having this competition for our students."" Upon advertising the new club to students on campus, Esports coaches and sponsors at NACC were pleasantly surprised by the amount of student interest. “We knew this was a growing sport and that there would be interest, but we were excited to see how quickly students jumped onboard,” said Bryon Miller, Mustang Gaming Sponsor and Computer Science Instructor at NACC. “There are so many opportunities here for students to learn, compete, and participate with this club.” Opportunities in Esports expand beyond just competition. Students may commentate on the sport, create video content, manage a team, write computer programs, or develop games, analyze game and player statistics, and much more. ""We have been anxiously waiting for all our equipment and furniture to arrive and that day is finally here"" said Patricia Falk, Educational Technology Director, and Esports Planning Committee Member. A setup day has been scheduled for Tuesday, July 26th, 2022, at 1:00 p.m. in the Business Education Building, Rm 206. All interested students are welcome to come and help with the room setup. On the surface, the Mustang Gaming Esports Club seems like a great idea. But when you dig deeper, you can find some serious problems with the concept. This sounds like a great way for students to spend their free time, but there are some major issues with this idea. First off, this club requires students to pay $10 per semester for membership fees. This money goes towards paying coaches, buying equipment, and setting aside funds for travel expenses if any of the teams qualify for tournaments outside of campus or state boundaries. While these fees are not unreasonable, it does seem strange that they would be required from all students regardless of whether or not they plan on participating in esports events on campus or not. I know several students who now explore https://fixgerald.com/ to use free plagiarism checker instead of paying for the expensive one. Students are using free services to afford charges for such clubs. On the surface, the Mustang Gaming Esports Club seems like a great idea.

The students were so excited to have the chance to actually see, in person, all this space history up close and personal.” As for highlights from the U.S. Space & Rocket Center, students most enjoyed the G-Force ride, and learned about cutting-edge NASA tech currently in the works, including a new suit with a helmet that will allow astronauts to have a 360-degree view. “I got to ride on the Multi-Axis Trainer. It was very fast. I couldn’t tell which direction I was going, because it was going everywhere at the same time,” student Brittlee Hopper said. “It felt like I was drifting off into space. Also, it felt like there was no gravity while on the ride.” Sign up now to get our FREE breaking news coverage delivered right to your inbox.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'West When Morgan County sheriff\'s deputies raided a house in Hartselle on Friday, they reported seizing 18 grams of fentanyl. That\'s only about the weight of seven pennies, but it\'s enough fentanyl to kill about 9,000 people. The synthetic opioid has become a growing danger locally and nationally. Some users turn to fentanyl-laced drugs to provide a more euphoric effect, and dealers mix it with other drugs to increase their potency — sometimes with buyers unaware. “We’re seeing a lot more deaths involving fentanyl,"" Limestone County Coroner Mike West said. ""More autopsy reports than not are coming back on overdoses, and they’re showing the presence of fentanyl in the body.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 105,752 Americans died from fentanyl-related overdoses in the 12-month period ending in October, the latest figures available. The deaths set a record and were up from an estimated 69,000 deaths a year earlier. The CDC stats show 1,232 Alabamians died in 2021 from overdoses, up 28.33% from the 960 reported in 2020. Morgan County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Mike Swafford said that in addition to the increase in the number of overdose cases, a surge in the amount of fentanyl being found is startling. He said Morgan County sheriff’s deputies seized 96.4 grams of the drug in the 16 months from Jan. 1, 2021, through Thursday, an average of about 6 grams per month. That was an increase of 727% over 2020 when the department seized an average of 0.825 of a gram monthly. Swafford said habitual drug users appear to be most impacted by fentanyl trafficking and overdoses. “It is not the teenagers, but those a little older, maybe late 20s into their 40s, from what we’ve seen,” Swafford said. “One arrested drug user told us, ‘Fentanyl is all that works for me. Heroin doesn’t do anything for me any longer.\'"" Pharmaceutical fentanyl is a synthetic opioid approved for treating severe pain, often in advanced cancer patients, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration and medical experts. It is 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine. It is prescribed in the form of transdermal patches or lozenges and occasionally is diverted to illegal use. But law enforcement experts say most fentanyl bought on the streets is illegally made and then mixed with heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine or even marijuana. They say 2 grams, about the equivalent of an artificial sweetener packet on a restaurant table, is enough to kill 1,000 people. Limestone County\'s West said he believes most of the overdoses with fentanyl are accidental. “A drug user may come out of rehab and they were accustomed to using X amount of heroin or methamphetamine, whatever drug they might be using, but dealers are adding fentanyl to the drugs and some end up dying because of the overdose,” he said. Local coroners don\'t have complete statistics on fentanyl-related deaths, but Morgan County Coroner Jeff Chunn said he recorded five overdose deaths from Feb. 20-28 and at least two of them involved Decatur victims and fentanyl. “For the entire month of February, there were nine suspected overdose deaths (in Morgan County) and at least three were in Decatur and involved fentanyl,” he said. In Lawrence County, Sheriff\'s Office Chief Deputy Brian Covington said the narcotics unit seized 192 grams of fentanyl in the past 12 months. That is enough to kill 96,000 people found in a county with a population of 34,000. One 89-gram load the unit recovered had a street value of $15,000, he said. Lawrence Sheriff Max Sanders said if fentanyl addiction continues to grow, “it will become everybody’s problem.” “It is fast becoming the drug of choice,” he said. “It has changed the way we handle drugs and even how it goes to the crime lab. They want it double-sealed, double-bagged. We have to treat the drug with respect. A very little amount can get through your skin and infect you in a hurry.” In March 2021, a Jefferson County sheriff\'s deputy was proof of that when she overdosed from being exposed to fentanyl during a seizure raid. The deputy was administered naloxone, also known as Narcan, which is considered a life-saver in the war on opioid addiction. Preventing deaths Local, state and national authorities say education on the dangers of fentanyl and limiting access to the synthetic opioid are the most effective ways of saving lives. One way to prevent deaths involves administering naloxone. According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, naloxone works by blocking the effects of opiates on the brain and by restoring breathing. It is administered through an injection or pen or nasal mist. Swafford said Morgan deputies carry Narcan spray dispensers in their vehicles. In 2020, Morgan deputies administered 17 Narcan sprays at the scenes of overdoses and last year that number climbed to 28 incidents, he said. “If the overdose isn’t opioid related, the Narcan doesn’t work, but there is no harm to it either,"" Swafford said. ""If it is opioid-related, (the victim) will immediately come around, maybe 10 seconds. But they still need medical attention.” Laura Burdeshaw, program manager of Another Chance at the Decatur Morgan Hospital Parkway campus, said Narcan has made its way into drug or trap houses. “Some have a person the equivalent of a designated driver,” she said. “There is someone there who is not doing drugs and watching the others. If somebody overdoses, they are hitting them with the Narcan pen (or nasal mist) to reverse the overdose and everyone else must stop. … Not all people using heroin and fentanyl are coming to the emergency room, so the amount of overdoses are not accurately shown in the ER numbers. ""Those people are taking care of their own. It’s scary. Sometimes, not even one dose of Narcan is enough.” She said several years ago, Narcan pens were about $120. Now they are about $50 over the counter at local pharmacies. Some cities, where drugs are a bigger problem, distribute them for free. Decatur City Schools and Lawrence County Schools have Narcan readily available for emergencies. DCS Deputy Superintendent Dwight Satterfield said high school resource officers provided by the Decatur Police Department have Narcan on their equipment belts. Jon Bret Smith, Lawrence superintendent, said Narcan is on the campuses of the county’s middle schools, high schools, career tech academy and alternative school. Sue Terrell, executive director of the nonprofit Hands Across Decatur, which provides assistance to the homeless, said her agency hasn\'t had any opioid-related problems but she fears it will. ""At Hands Across Decatur we are seeing an increase in people, unknown to us and not part of our homeless community, who appear to be high,"" she said. ""We just never know who may have unintentionally ingested fentanyl-laced heroin, meth, marijuana. Currently, when someone comes into our center whom we may suspect is high, we offer bottled water — as much as they want to drink. We encourage a sandwich — carbs help calm them down. We allow them to lay down and sleep it off. ""In the 10-plus years HAD has been in operation, we have not witnessed an overdose as of yet. However, with the increasing availability of fentanyl, it may be only a matter of time — unfortunately."" Hidden danger Drug users and street-level dealers often don\'t know whether or in what quantity fentanyl has been cut into another drug — even marijuana. The Drug Policy Alliance said fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are attractive cutting agents because they are cheap to produce and their strong sedative properties strengthen the drugs with which they are mixed. The alliance said the cutting is done higher up the chain than by street drug dealers. Another Chance\'s Burdeshaw said the program is seeing people who are using the same amount of illicit drugs as they have in the past but they’re overdosing because it now has fentanyl in it. “There is an alarming amount of teenagers using marijuana that has fentanyl cut into it,” she said. “Marijuana remains the top-abused illicit drug. The fentanyl is clearly coming from Mexico. It is being made in makeshift labs in the middle of a field somewhere. It’s not the fentanyl made for a prescription. It’s being made by people who aren’t chemists.” Burdeshaw said in the fall of 2017, the program had one known fentanyl user. “In the past 4½ years that number has dramatically increased. In the past year, 75% to 80% of the opioid cases we get now involve fentanyl,” she said. Michele Moore, prevention director at the Mental Health Center of North Alabama, called the issue with fentanyl “a horrible problem.” “Most people smoking marijuana are not looking for that kind of high,” Moore said about effects brought on by the potent fentanyl. “But today the marijuana might be mixed with fentanyl and the user has an overdose and could possibly die.” She said teenage drug users generally favor marijuana, but not heroin. “Now just smoking a joint, they have to realize there might be something'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:14 pm This image provided by the city of Florence, Ala, shows the old and new logo for Florence, Ala. The northern Alabama city's new logo is sparking a visceral reaction among residents. When Florence unveiled its new logo this week, it drew immediate backlash and an online petition demanding changes that had more than 5,000 signatures. The logo uses the name Florence, and arranges two letters after the F into an exclamation point. FLORENCE, Ala. (AP) — Some residents think a northern Alabama city’s new logo might be sending the wrong message. Florence’s new logo uses the first three letters of its name — a capital F followed by an L and an O arranged as an exclamation point — to form F! When the city unveiled the new logo this week, it drew immediate backlash and an online petition demanding changes that had nearly 7,500 signatures. The city paid $25,000 to a Birmingham marketing firm for the branding, WAAY-TV reported. “The new logo symbolizes the people of Florence’s passion and love for the city,” the city said in a news release announcing the new logo. “A sense of amazement, delight and pride is all reflected in the Florence logo exclamation point.” City leaders are pushing back on claims that they didn’t consider hiring a local firm to do the work, saying a request for proposals was issued but no local companies responded. Residents were engaged early in the process through a community survey sent to hundreds of people, city officials said. WAAY-TV reports that it was unable to find a copy of the survey and the city didn’t respond to its requests to see it. In a letter to residents Thursday, Florence Mayor Andy Betterton said the new branding “will serve multiple needs and audiences as our community grows and moves forward.” “As we navigate developing the new branding, one thing is for sure; the process has highlighted our community’s talents, humor, and love for Florence,” Betterton wrote. City Council member Kaytrina Simmons said she has requested a meeting with the mayor and council to discuss the logo and revise it. In a letter to residents, Simmons apologized for the logo which “has brought so much disappointment to our great city.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.
