The four students, only identified as three 17-year-olds and one 18-year-old, were all rushed to an area hospital and are expected to survive, police said. No other students, faculty or staff were injured, the school district said in a statement emailed to news media outlets. The Atlanta Police Department told USA TODAY the school district\'s own police department is the lead agency investigating the shooting. The Atlanta Public Schools Police Department declined to comment on the shooting. All after-school activities were canceled and classes are expected to resume as scheduled on Thursday, the school district said. Police immediately began searching for a possible vehicle seen in the parking lot at the time of the shooting. Atlanta Police Major Ralph Woolfolk said in a Wednesday evening news conference they were able to ""quickly get a vehicle stopped."" In the car, which was stopped about five miles away from the school, police found a 35-year-old mother, a 17-year-old girl and another male. All three were taken to police headquarters for questioning and all three were cooperating and speaking with investigators, according to Woolfolk. No charges have been filed and the names of those involved have not been released. Police said a fight broke out around 4 p.m., just after students were dismissed for the day, which led to gunshots being fired.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:25 am FOSTER – Town Councilor Heidi Rogers has revealed a letter from a former town employee who chose to leave his job at the town’s building and zoning office claiming a “toxic atmosphere.” Lawrence Desormier, currently Scituate’s building official, drafted a letter to Foster Town Council President Denise DiFranco in April of 2022 outlining his reasons for leaving the position. Rogers said she’d hoped the issue would be brought up at last Thursday’s meeting, but when it was not, said she hopes it will be discussed at the next meeting. Rogers posted Desormier’s resignation letter and sent a copy to The Valley Breeze & Observer, stating that she shared it with Desormier’s consent. “Nothing has been done, and the environment continues,” she said. “There are many more (complaints from others).” In his letter, Desormier said he left the part-time position with short notice, and “under the circumstances with the condition of that office’s toxic atmosphere, with the humiliating, intimidating and verbal abuse, I find it affecting my health and well-being.” Desormier said working in the office affected his home life with his family, and he simply couldn’t take the environment. “I tried to do my job the right way and always had the town’s best interest at heart, but I must consider what is best for me and my family,” he wrote. While thanking the town for the support afforded him to do his job, Desormier said his leaving was not due to lack of effort by DiFranco or other council members. He thanked DiFranco and Councilor David Paolino for their efforts to correct the issues. Desormier said he was “belittled, talked down upon and outright ignored as a department head.” He said he felt speaking out would have caused tension and animosity among workers. “But again, the anxiety and depression it has created in my life is not worth a part-time job,” he said. Desormier wrote that a particular employee had a lack of respect and actively bullied him. He added that other former employees agree that the toxic atmosphere stems from one employee, someone he said is “bullying, intimidating, controlling and belittling.” “Her interference with my clerk and my ability to do the job correctly is difficult to overcome at this point,” he said. I remember about 10-12 years ago Bobby DePalo exposed Gordon Rogers in the Valley Breeze for being how he has always been, a bully.The town citizens praised Bobby privately and publicly for doing this, because no one else would. Everyone is afraid of retribution. This has been going on for years. When will it stop? Gordon and Heidi will stop at nothing, and stoop to the lowest level to get what they want.Does anyone else remember this? 🤔 I remember about 10-12 years ago Bobby DePalo exposed Gordon Rogers in the Valley Breeze for being how he has always been, a bully.

Dan McKee delivers his annual State of the State address in the House Chamber of the Rhode Island State House Tuesday evening. PROVIDENCE, R.I. – Gov. Daniel McKee committed to raising the per capita income in Rhode Island in his annual State of the State address on Tuesday. Specifically, the goal is to raise per capita income by at least $20,000 by 2030. Rhode Island’s per capita income was about $43,000 in 2022, according to the most recent census data. “Just think how much housing insecurity and food insecurity we could address as a state if we double down and work to raise per capita income across Rhode Island, helping every family,” he said. Like with his education plan last year, McKee promised to release a detailed plan in the next 100 days to meet his per capita income goal while also highlighting work in other policy areas from last year that may already be contributing to that goal. For example, McKee emphasized the job creation opportunities from more state spending on items such as affordable housing, fixing the state’s roads and bridges, developing another offshore wind farm and increasing tourism to the state. In these areas, McKee proposed both new funding in the state budget, such as $5 million to help municipalities expedite infrastructure projects, and two new bond referendums, a $100 million housing production bond and a bond to fund the construction of a new State Archive and History Center. Another example McKee cited was the State Institute for Cybersecurity and Emerging Technologies, which former Congressman Jim Langevin and Rhode Island College President Jack Warner launched last year, promising to help students break into a lucrative industry. This year, McKee suggested putting a cybersecurity bond before voters to grow the program, and set a goal of enrolling 1,000 students in the next five years. The per capita income goal mirrors a similar pledge from last year to boost key metrics of the state’s education – standardized test scores, attendance rates and Free Application for Federal Student Aid completion – to Massachusetts levels by 2030. McKee commended the team who’s been working on those efforts since then, including Education Commissioner Angelica Infante-Green and former National Education Association of Rhode Island Executive Director Bob Walsh, who now heads the nonprofit Always Learning Rhode Island. Though the administration has been working on all three of those metrics, last year saw a strong focus on attendance in particular, something school districts nationwide have struggled with since the pandemic. Statewide absence has hovered between 8,000 and 15,000 students daily since the start of this school year, according to the state’s data tools that were launched as part of the improvement plan. McKee recognized two Providence students, second-grade Alejandro Uz and high school junior Isabella Vasquez, who improved their attendance in the last year. “We know that students who attend school regularly perform, on average, about 20 points better on reading and math than those who are chronically absent – that’s why attendance matters,” he said. McKee promised to continue funding education support, including a new $15 million line item this year for math and English coaching for students and professional development for teachers, but he also called on families to “join the team” to improve education outcomes. “Every home, every day, learning matters,” he said. Just as McKee echoed promises from last year on education, House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale reprised Republican calls to give parents more choice in where to send their children to school in his State of the State response. “We support parents who are no longer accepting that their children’s futures must be invested in the same broken systems,” he said. “Parents and students alike want to receive a quality education and we’re obligated to respect and support the wishes of those parents by providing the options to best educate their children.” Strengthening the state’s health care system also made the list of top priorities this year, specifically making improvements to the state’s hospitals. In addition to another round of direct payments to hospitals, McKee proposed $135 million to increase health care provider rates and support behavioral health services, as well as funding to bring rate increases for early intervention up to levels recommended by the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner. He also teased an executive order that will create a working group focused on health care improvement. Chippendale also singled out health care as a high-priority area. “Rhode Island’s health care system is sadly collapsing,” he said. “We’re hemorrhaging practitioners of every discipline, from specialists to support positions. Providers are retiring at an ever-increasing rate or fleeing our state altogether while most graduates are not even looking for health care jobs here in Rhode Island.” He called for the General Assembly to pass legislation to incentivize medical graduates to stay in Rhode Island, adjust the Medicaid reimbursement rate and reinstitute access to telemedicine across state lines. McKee championed the new State Health Lab, which began construction last year, as benefiting both health care in Rhode Island and as another facet of his plan to increase incomes. With a push from House Speaker Joseph Shekarchi, last year’s budget included the creation of a new quasi-public agency and $45 million for that new agency to support the development of the life science sector in the state. “For over a decade, Rhode Islanders have stepped up to the microphone and talked about how Massachusetts is a leader in life science and that Rhode Island could be as well,” McKee said. “Instead of dreaming of that possibility, thanks to the leadership of Speaker Shekarchi, we’re making it a reality.” In a speech that foreshadowed big asks from voters on the 2024 ballot, McKee struck a tone of teamwork, interweaving references to his time as a coach of the Rhode Island Shooting Stars basketball team. “They were an example of a team who helped each other do their very best,” he said. “In many ways, their story is Rhode Island’s story too. In 2024, Team Rhode Island will continue using our skills to make our state one of the very best in the nation. We will use our resources to put people to work in good-paying jobs on projects that will pay dividends for decades to come.” Log In Keep it Clean.

Narciso joked he worked for “the enemy,” Stop and Shop, but said that he deeply appreciated that former Valueland employees still had enough love for each other and their old job. “When I reflect on my time working for the grocery store, beautiful memories, great life skills, family, friends, friendships that were made lasting up until this very day,” Narciso said. Speaking to the crowd on behalf of Cipalone, Narciso said that the experiences that former Valueland employees took away with them helped make them who they are, and told them to make sure to treasure them. In total, 22 former employees, as well as a few additional friends, showed up, with one attendee coming from as far as Florida. Another had kept her old name tag from her time working there, and wore it to the event. All of those little touches, Cipalone said, showed the importance of Valueland in the store’s former employees’ lives, even all these years later. Though life had changed for those who got together again, the nature of the evening resulted in plenty of reminiscing. Cipalone said that while she was at first worried about low attendance, hosting the event and seeing a room filled with old faces was incredibly rewarding. “It’s a typical Rhode Island story — everybody knows somebody, and that’s how the word got out,” Cipalone said. “We had a wonderful turnout, and we’re going to do it again.” After more than 30 years apart, no one was in a rush to leave.

out and about in Worcester, perhaps near the Clark University campus, you might come across Owen Dominguez taking photos, and he might ask to take a photo of you. As a 10-year-old in Silver Spring, Maryland, he was given a camera as a gift that would later set in motion a passion for photography, which he is now studying at Clark. This includes explorations of film as well as digital photography, and the art and science of the dark room. Dominguez now owns eight cameras, and recently spoke about his ongoing journey in photography, the challenges of trustworthy images in a time of alterations and manipulations, and the role he wants to play in capturing life through a clear lens. How and when did you become interested in photography? So, my first camera, which I actually still have with me, I got it when I was 10 years old, so, in 2014. I grew up in Maryland, in Silver Spring, just outside Washington, D.C. Flash forward to my junior year of high school, 2021 to 2022. A bunch of my friends were on the school soccer team. I borrowed my friend\'s camera, and took pictures of my friend\'s soccer team, and they loved it. On the bus with the team, I\'d hang out on the sidelines, taking pictures. The summer after my junior year, and the next summer as well, I worked for a team, the Silver Spring Thunderbolts, a summer (baseball) team. I got paid for taking pictures of the team. I was the team\'s photographer. I had to come to pretty much every game. How did you come to be in the Worcester area? I go to Clark University. My brother had suggested it to me, based on my interested in media, and art. He had a friend coming here, so I\'m here because of Clark. I\'m a freshman, and my major is media, arts and culture, and I\'m a creative writing minor. What are some things you are doing within your major? The first semester, I took media, culture and the arts 101. It\'s a requirement for the major. We look at all different media. For photography and film, we just look at the history of all of that. Now, in my second semester, I am finally taking action. I\'m taking photo classes, and taking photos all the time. More: \'The Catskills\' at Central Mass Jewish Film Fest takes nostalgic look at Borscht Belt More: Janice Harvey: Getting out to local cultural events supports artists More: Listen Up: Kristian Montgomery and the Winterkill Band let loose with \'Lower County Outlaw\' Are there things, people or situations you find yourself gravitating toward? Definitely. Because of my interest in taking pictures as a sports photographer, I did that exclusively two to three years. I grew up playing sports. I love sports. It is only now, with my film class and film photographers, I started taking pictures of the Worcester community. When I don\'t have class, I will take my camera down Main Street, or to the pond. I really like trying to find inanimate objects, and landscapes. If there are people involved, I usually want to take pictures from further away. I am drawn to the architect of Worcester, a lot of the architecture that surrounds Clark University. There is a lot to see. Has photography made for familiarity with Worcester? That is a great question. I\'ve only been here since August. Walking around outside, I can walk wherever I like, at least near campus. I\'ve become more comfortable taking pictures. So, with people approaching, I\'ll say, ""Hey, I\'m a student. Can I take your picture?"" It has propelled me to explore Worcester further. What are some special projects you are working on? So, recently, I\'ve begun the process of enlarging and making prints. This is within class. I\'ve been shooting a roll of film a week for this class. That is sort of the expectation. I\'ve had to use a dark room, and make these prints. Separately, I\'ve been using an Epson scanner ... that has been a super fun challenge. I\'d never had experience with film prior to Clark. What are fundamental differences between film and digital?There is a big difference in the way I shoot digitally. When I\'m photographing sports, I can get bursts of action. But with the film, I have to be more meticulous, frame by frame. That has been a welcome challenge, and basic understanding of photography has carried over. What to you is special about the medium of photography? That\'s a great question, and a thoughtful question. I think photo as a medium is very special. I\'ve had to do research, because the medium of photography wasn\'t always respected as an art. Now, I think, photography is more popular than ever. You are capturing reality in the realest way possible. We know that nowadays, there are challenges, because photo and video can be manipulated. How do see yourself in the future of the integrity of photography? I definitely see myself as part of a rising generation of photographers, and in doing film. I see that as a fine art of practice. I think digital is going to remain. ... the future of photography as it applies to me I want especially as a student, to make as much of a difference as I can, taking pictures on campus, and providing (photos) for various clubs and teams. I want to have a good reputation, and the ability to be trusted. I won\'t take any pictures that are called into question. I want to be authentic. You can argue that there is a lack of authenticity in media today. My key responsibility is to have authenticity. Are there faculty or advisors who you look to? I would say, my photography professor, Stephen DiRado. He s a big reason I came to Clark in the first place. I came up for the accepted students\' day to tour the school. They do all this stuff to show you around. He had a camera strapped on. I said, ""I\'m a photography student."" He told me stories, showed me the dark room setup ... now, I\'m taking his class, and he has so much experience. He has all these stories, all this knowledge. I\'m trying to soak up as much as I can. I would definitely say he\'s been a driving force in my creative process. What kinds of cameras do you use? For film photography, I use a Canon A-1. It is a camera from 1978, and originally belonged to my girlfriend’s grandfather. I started using the camera for class and have grown to love the feel of it, being much heavier than my digital camera. My digital camera is a Canon EOS R10, which was released in 2022. Alongside it, I mainly use a 100-milimeter to 400-milimeter lens to shoot sports. I got this camera during my senior year of high school. I wanted a modern mirrorless digital camera, which it is, that could also zoom far enough to capture sports. As of this moment in time, where would you like to take photography, and where would you like photography to take you? If you asked me a month ago, I\'d say I want to be a professional sports photographer. But now, as I\'ve gotten more into film photography, I wouldn\'t want to just confine myself to one thing and take sports photography the rest of my life. Maybe some news outlet, or some large corporation where my photos can be used for publication or promotional material. I would want my photography to be the center of attention. These days, people can take pictures on their phone, including selfies. What to you is the difference versus taking photos with a professional camera? I think with the cellphone, it is ignorant to say it doesn\'t count. I think there is a level of artistry to take pictures of yourself, and challenge yourself. When I take pictures of myself, or I\'ll have my roommate or girlfriend take a picture of me, I will just be the model, and just be the subject. But it\'s hard. I know I will be editing the picture. I think intention is important. If you are just taking selfies or pictures of whatever on your phone, maybe that\'s a little different. If you went out to take a meaningful picture on your phone, I think that\'s just as meaningful. To learn more, visit Owen Dominguez\'s profile at smugmug.com.

residents has made its recommendations, including two potential homestead exemptions. The committee, which includes Councilman Erik Brine, presented its final report to the town council at its Feb. 5 meeting. The panel was represented by Bob Raymond. “All of these are really pushed by a desire to reflect our values as a town,” he said. “While they might not apply to a lot of residents, we think it was an important thing to put on paper.” The committee said it had six priorities. That included making Jamestown more affordable for primary residents; creating opportunities to meet budgetary objectives while minimizing the impact on taxpayers; protecting local businesses; keeping taxes low for residents on fixed incomes, especially senior citizens; making it more affordable for people who work in town; and incentivizing long-term rentals. According to the committee, homestead exemptions have become “very popular” in vacation destinations because of their large nonresident populations. In Jamestown, nearly half of the 2,700 residences are owned by people who aren’t full-time residents. “These exemptions provide an opportunity to keep taxes low for residents while leveraging the popularity of their communities for vacation-goers and multiple-home owners to provide the necessary funding to maintain the infrastructure and management of the town,” the committee wrote. The first option was to provide a flat percentage as an exemption. For example, if a home is assessed at $500,000 and the exemption rate is 20 percent, the homeowner would have the first $100,000 of their home value exempted from their tax bill, therefore resetting their assessed value at $400,000. This option could be capped at a certain level to ensure the amount of savings is not dramatically skewed by outliers with extremely high-valued homes. The second option would provide a flat exemption amount. For example, if the exemption amount was $200,000, properties worth $500,000 would be valued at $300,000 for tax purposes. If this option were chosen, the committee recommended for the council to tie the amount of the exemption to the change in median home valuation made during every revaluation assessment. Both would be available to homeowners who rent their properties to the same person for at least 12 months. “The reason we narrowed it down to two recommendations is because they are simple,” Brine said. “We don’t really have a complicated tax structure.” Mary Meagher, vice president of the council, said she preferred the second option. “Twenty percent off my house will be X amount, but 20 percent off a house that is worth $4 million is a whole lot more money,” she said. “We’re suddenly talking about real money. Sometimes the flat number is actually the fairest.” The committee also recommended a tax stabilization program. This would allow residents on fixed incomes to defer taxes that are more than 5 percent of their income. Taxes deferred would be held as a receivable until a triggering event occurs, like the sale of a property or a death, which requires a full payment of the deferred taxes. Amounts deferred could be charged interest. The committee said the exemption for POWs ($500 credit) and Gold Star parents ($300 credit) should be “dramatically increased.” It also recommended for municipal employees, including police officers and teachers, to be recognized with a tax credit, similar to what the volunteer firefighters receive. Not everyone on the board, however, agreed with this. Raymond said one member thought hiring people from outside of town was a benefit. For senior citizens, their income-based exemptions are tied to the poverty rate, which the committee said is helpful because it allows for those requirements to change annually. The qualifying incomes are capped at 220 percent of the poverty level which means that at income levels above $29,898, exemptions are fully phased out. The committee recommended for the council to consider “shifting each of the categories to a higher percentage of poverty level to commensurately increase the income level caps.” They also suggested for the disability exemptions to match the senior exemptions.
