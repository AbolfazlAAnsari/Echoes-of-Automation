The discourse following the ouster of Harvard University President Claudine Gay has been decidedly muddled by a variety of conflicting perspectives across the political spectrum. But the truth of the matter is not complicated at all — Gay was the target of a politically motivated attack launched by right-wing activists who openly proclaimed their goal to suppress diversity in higher education. It is concerning, however, that the people who launched this campaign were able to successfully disguise their intentions under a liberal framework. Meet Chris Rufo, a conservative activist and white nationalist who has made it his life’s work to fight critical race theory (CRT) and discussion of LGBTQ+ issues in schools. He is largely considered to be one of the architects of the mounting conservative hysteria around CRT. Parallel to the CRT panic, his ilk also attacks diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, programs designed to encourage diversity in the workplace, which white nationalists (incorrectly) claim are responsible for everything from indoctrination in schools to airplane failures. Rufo called Gay a “DEI totem,” implying that she was only hired because of DEI programs and was therefore unqualified. This is false on several levels.

The claim that she is a “DEI hire” is pure unbridled racism.

In fact, a majority of American workers believe that DEI improved their workplace, and billionaire Mark Cuban argues that DEI actually allows employers to hire more qualified candidates by eliminating exclusionary preferences and expanding the available talent pool. Additionally, as Harvard student Kyla Golding illustrated in the The Harvard Crimson, having diverse figures in positions of power is a worthwhile end in and of itself, irrespective of the question of merit. For students who are Black women, having a Black woman as Harvard president is empowering. The value of this should not be understated. But — aside from some influential donors — conservatives hold little power in academia due to the simple fact that well-educated people are most likely to hold consistently liberal beliefs. So, to successfully oust Gay, it was necessary to frame the attack in terms that would be agreeable to liberal audiences. She gave an admittedly bad performance testifying before Congress, where she failed to outright condemn calls for the genocide of Jews.

The real reasons for the attacks on Gay — her race and the fact that she did not sufficiently suppress criticisms of the state of Israel on the Harvard campus — alone were not enough to force her resignation. So there followed secondary criticisms which served to “legitimize” the attacks to liberal audiences: the claims of academic misconduct and the worrying rise in antisemitism. But this is clearly not why the attacks were launched, and this is not the end for racist, bad-faith actors like Rufo who simply want to suppress Black voices and ideas in academia. Therefore, I urge you, as students and faculty of an elite university, not to fall for their tricks.

CC0 1.0 A new type of synthesized plastic can stay in its molded state after cooling, which has important implications for addressing plastic waste and recycling. As the spring semester is kicking into high gear, let’s go over some of the biggest headlines in science news from the past week. Researchers synthesize a moldable plastic Researchers at the University of Chicago synthesized a new type of plastic that can be molded into different shapes at high temperatures. Their results are published in Science. Typical plastics lose their rigidity and become structurally flexible when heated. As typical plastics cool, their polymer’s complex bonds fail to reform, making it unable to retain its shape. However, this new plastic retains its stiffness upon cooling, forming special thia-Michael networks that have a high degree of cross-linking at low temperatures. After heating this plastic to temperatures between 60 to 100 degrees Celsius, the researchers molded it into a desired shape and then cooled it. This process of heating and cooling a material to change its structure is called tempering. The material allowed products to stay in their molded shape even after cooling. The team successfully made a spoon, a fork, a claw and an adhesive with this process. Humans have been tempering metals for hundreds of years, however, the temperatures required for tempering this plastic are much lower and easily achieved in a microwave. This opens up many new applications of this plastic in new contexts. The researchers discussed the applications of bringing this plastic into space, allowing astronauts to easily mold the material into tools they need for various tasks. In addition, through reusing plastic for multiple purposes, this new material could help reduce plastic waste and make recycling easier. Nevertheless, there still are some limitations. The material can only retain its shape for a month. Therefore, the researchers are looking to make further improvements before this new plastic can be an efficient replacement for typical plastic products. New NASA satellite prepares for its launch this week Costing nearly $1 billion, the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite will be launched on Tuesday, Feb. 6. The satellite will focus on understanding the growth of phytoplankton species and the carbon dioxide exchange between the atmosphere and ocean. Plankton, algae, and bacteria in the ocean produce about 50% of the Earth’s oxygen, but it is difficult to study planktons in detail because current satellites only collect light in a few channels such as red, green and blue. However, PACE is set to collect light in over 200 channels, including many shades of green that can help scientists distinguish between plankton species. This will allow scientists to analyze different pigments in the plankton species that allow for photosynthesis. Planktons are also important in the storage of carbon in the ocean. Warmer waters store much less carbon dioxide than colder waters, which means the rise in global temperatures decreases the ocean's ability to store carbon dioxide. By studying different plankton species in various parts of the ocean with PACE, scientists can identify regions that are affected by this phenomenon. In addition to its many light channels, PACE is also equipped with polarimeters to study how aerosols and clouds reflect sunlight to investigate their contributions to climate change. With data collected by PACE, new policies can be designed to regulate the emission of specific problematic aerosols to help combat climate change. The cerebellum plays an essential role in birds’ ability to fly Only three types of vertebrates have the ability to fly: birds, bats and the now-extinct pterosaurs. In addition to the physical adaptations in the body such as long upper body limbs and an aerodynamic body, scientists have been looking for important neural processes that underlie the development of flight. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Stony Brook University found the growth of the cerebellum to be key to the evolution of flight. The cerebellum has been known to be responsible for motor control, but there was not enough evidence connecting it to flight. By using PET scans to examine pigeons’ brains before and after flight, the researchers found an increase in activity in the cerebellum and optic flow pathways connecting the eyes to the cerebellum. Additionally, they modeled the brains of dinosaurs who preceded the emergence of ancient birds. They found an increase in cerebellum size in early dinosaurs. Future studies need to confirm this phenomenon is found in other species that can fly. Looking forward, the researchers want to investigate specific neural mechanisms within the cerebellum that allow for flight. Ultracold supermolecules open new quantum doors Researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics and theorists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have created a tetratomic supermolecule at near absolute zero temperature. Their results were published in Nature. Atoms come together at a certain distance to form bonds where their attractive and repulsive forces are balanced. However, in supermolecules, atoms create much longer bonds, typically hundreds of times longer than bonds in typical molecules. Atoms in the supermolecule are weakly bound to each other, and small changes in the environment can cause a large change in the forces holding the molecule together. The formation of supermolecules requires extremely cold temperatures. Using a novel method of cooling involving a rotating microwave field, the researchers created a supermolecule out of two sodium and two potassium atoms at around one 10-millionth of a degree above absolute zero. The formation of this supermolecule opens up the opportunity to create a Bose-Einstein condensate, where all the particles assume the same quantum state.

Environmental Coordinator Kevin Carpenter-Driscoll told council at its January 22 regular meeting that these costs include an estimated $36,000 in staff time, $10,000 to $20,000 in hazardous waste disposal fees, $3,000 in environmental recovery fees and $15,000 to $30,000 in tub grinder services. (Municipalities cannot use the free hazardous waste disposal facility operated by the county.) Carpenter-Driscoll presented the options developed by Public Works staff to address these problems. All options include installing security cameras to discourage dumping. There were no actions requested at this time, just council direction. Northway Yard Waste and Mulch Pile This site was intended for city use and use by registered residents who obtain approval to deposit yard debris on the mulch pile. Carpenter-Driscoll said that illegal dumping by contractors is a major factor in the problems at this site. They dump construction debris and concrete/asphalt waste. Most of the dumping occurs overnight and on weekends, he said. Carpenter-Driscoll outlined three options for this site: 1) Eliminate the dumpsite and have city staff transfer its waste to the Prince George’s County Organics Composting Facility. This would increase staff costs. 2) Install a gate and restrict access to city staff and permit holders. 3) Continue with the current setup and budget for the extra costs. For option two, staff proposes that the gate be placed close to Northway’s intersection with Ridge Road. The gate would be open during normal business hours and closed overnight and weekends. Several councilmembers expressed objections to the proposed gate location. They described the area as a city park including ballfields and the City Observatory. Plus, the area is used by other residents for impromptu or unscheduled activities, such as walking. Councilmember Rodney Roberts strongly supported the first option stating that both the millings pile and the mulch pile are contaminating streams in the area. Mayor Emmett Jordan said the gate should be located much further in on Northway so as not to restrict so many resident activities. Carpenter-Driscoll countered that staff was concerned that with a gate that far back on the property, contractors would simply dump their waste in front of the gate. Greenbelt East Residential Recycling Center This site is located off Hanover Parkway across from the dog park. The illegal dumping in this area is more residential than at the Northway site, with a lot of furniture and heavy bulk materials. While the city installed trash containers for non-recyclables, the site continues to see trash deposited into the recycling containers. The options identified by staff were to eliminate the site or install perimeter fencing and enforce hours of operation. Buddy Attick Recycling Center Located outside the Public Works yard adjacent to Buddy Attick Park, this site collects the broadest range of materials including used oil, bulk recycling, food scraps, oyster shells, textiles and regular trash. Except for the used oil collection, staff identified just one option, fencing off the area to restrict use during non-business hours. Staff also proposed that collection of used motor oil be moved inside the existing public works compound next to the salt bays. Residents could register to gain access to the site during off hours and any resident could deposit oil during Public Works normal business hours when the gate is open. This was the one proposal to which council gave staff direction, indicating support for creating a new used oil collection center inside the yard. Enforcement Terri Hruby, director of Planning and Community Development, was asked how illegal dumping incidents caught on camera would be handled. She said that Public Works would provide vehicle information to Code Enforcement staff, who would work with police to identify the vehicle owner and issue a citation. The remaining proposals were deferred until they could be discussed further in a worksession. © 2024 Greenbelt News Review'}]"

One person who sustained lacerations at the scene of the St. Mary’s County fire was transported to a regional trauma center. According to Oliver Alkire of the Maryland State Fire Marshal’s Office, a fire that was intentionally set at a residence resulted in $400,000 in damages. Alkire told Southern Maryland News the incident remains under investigation and no names are being released at this time. “We’re hoping to make an arrest in the next 24 hours,” Alkire said Monday morning. On Wednesday afternoon, the fire marshal deputy said that a suspect “is still in the hospital,” and that charges against the person are pending. Alkire said investigators have determined the perpetrator put a flame to “ordinary combustibles” to start the blaze. A 911 call was made from the residence shortly after 8 p.m. last Friday. A report from the Seventh District Volunteer Fire Department stated, “Crews arrived on the scene and located a two-story home with heavy fire throughout the structure.” A posted report from the Hollywood Volunteer Fire Department, stated, “While units were responding, communications advised that police were on the scene reporting a house was set on fire, with occupants potentially still inside.” No other injuries were reported. An unidentified person with lacerations was ground-transported to the Capital Regional Medical Center in Largo. Monday house fire injures three The state fire marshal’s office is also investigating a house fire that occurred Monday during the noon hour on Notley Wood Lane in Chaptico. The blaze resulted in minor injuries for three firefighters and caused an estimated $250,000 damages to a one-story, single-family home owned and occupied by Virginia Petit. The fire was discovered by workers who were on the property site and, the fire marshal’s office reported, a smoke alarm did activate. Firefighters, including from Seventh District Volunteer Fire Department, had the blaze under control in 40 minutes. Get any of our free email newsletters.

quarterback in a flag football game. Muhammad Oliver, a former NFL defensive back for the Denver Broncos, Green Bay Packers, Kansas City Chiefs, Miami Dolphins and Washington Football Team, said in an interview that he would not allow his son to play tackle football until age 12. (Photo courtesy of Oliver Family) By MICHAEL ROVETTO and JUDITH ALTNEU Capital News Service Domonique Foxworth played his first organized tackle football game at 10 years old. Now Foxworth has a son who turns 11 on Super Bowl Sunday and wants to play tackle. Foxworth won’t allow it. His son is playing flag football instead. When might he allow his son to play tackle? Foxworth said, “We’ll see.” “It’s definitely not going to be before high school,” said Foxworth, a former NFL cornerback and former president of the NFL Players Association. “I guess that would be the first time that we even consider the conversation. Right now he’s in the fifth grade, so we’ve got some time for him to fall in love with something else.” Interviews with several former NFL players, some of whom played tackle football before high school, revealed a range of opinions about whether children should participate in tackle leagues. Some are categorically opposed to youth playing tackle before the age of 12 or 14. Others said they would consider what a child wanted. All interviewed for this article said their thoughts about the sport had evolved since their days as youth players. “I honestly don’t see the benefit of playing tackle football at a young age because flag football now is so available,” said Muhammad Oliver, a former defensive back who played four years in the NFL. Oliver said if taught correctly the skills learned in flag football can translate to tackle football. He said flag football allows kids to pick up the fundamentals of the sport and understand how it’s played. Oliver has seven children, four of whom are boys ages 27, 23, 12 and 9. His oldest son, Isaiah, plays for the San Francisco 49ers. Oliver allowed Isaiah to begin playing in a tackle league at age 8. If he had it to do over again, he said, Isaiah wouldn’t have played tackle football until he was 12. Oliver said his experience as a youth tackle football coach and as president of NX Level AthletX, a youth multisport development program in Goodyear, Arizona, has influenced his thinking. So has recent medical research linking youth tackle football to later-life challenges, such as impulse control and cognitive decline. “With all the information now about concussions and how often concussions are happening and the number of concussions that players have had over their lifetime, I just don’t feel like the contact is necessary young,” Oliver said. Former Super Bowl champion and Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson has been outspoken in warning of the risks of brain injury from the sport. In 2018, Carson was one of the ex-players to appear at a news conference sponsored by the Concussion Legacy Foundation announcing a campaign to discourage tackle football before the age of 14. Carson has repeatedly said in interviews that if he had it to do again, he would not have played football. Neither of Carson’s two sons played football at a competitive level, he said. Carson, who played 13 seasons for the New York Giants, has discouraged his grandson from playing. Carson advocates for transparency and education. “I would like for the surgeon general to issue a warning to parents,” he said, adding that adults should understand the risks of the sport. “Every parent should sign a waiver to fully understand what they are signing their kids up for when they play football or a contact sport,” Carson said. “Most parents of little boys of color will continue to allow their kids to play,” Carson said, “because, you know, they don’t want to deny their kids the opportunity to play because he has talent … not fully understanding that their kids may suffer the consequences down the road.” That differs somewhat from the view of Bruce Harper, a former New York Jets running back and kick returner whose NFL career lasted from 1977 to 1984. Harper never had to face a parental decision about youth football. He has two daughters, neither of whom played the sport. However, Harper said the decision should be left to the child. “It’s a decision each kid individually has to make. I don’t think the parents should decide for the kid if they can play or not,” he said. The NFLPA has no formal policy regarding tackle football for kids. However, the players union has backed several youth initiatives including both tackle and flag football. The players union also supports members serving on the boards of USA Football and other youth leagues. Additionally, the union provides financial and community support to players running football camps for kids, but these camps primarily stay away from tackle. “We encourage every level of football … to implement the health and safety protocols we have at the NFL level,” said George Atallah, the NFLPA’s assistant executive director of external affairs. “We don’t have a specific position on when we think young people should play it. That’s for the medical experts to determine.” Foxworth, who played for three teams from 2005-2011, sustained many injuries throughout his career. He’s been able to deal with injuries to his body, but brain injury will always be something he’s mindful of. “I still wouldn’t trade it for the life that I’ve had access to,” Foxworth said of his football career. “But it’s all a different conversation when you start talking about your brain.” Please read the first part of this series here.

Mendpara reflects on her relationship with storytelling. Growing up, the History Channel was my family’s absolute favorite thing to watch on TV. My grandparents’ version of an ideal Sunday night wasn\'t spent watching football: it was reruns of Decoding the Past. While I was always a bit disgruntled having to watch shows about cults and Armageddon, the History Channel gave me one of my favorite childhood fixation eras: Extreme Collectors. They only aired one season of Extreme Collectors, but to me, it was my version of Decoding the Past. I had such a fascination with watching people build storage spaces for their vintage coin-operated jukeboxes and empty rooms for their thousands of snow globes. This show made me realize that some collect vinyl, some collect books and some even collect animal bodies to preserve, slice, stuff and display. And so, I found myself on my own journey to find what would allow me to be equally guilty of indulging in a collecting frenzy. I tried it all: duct tape wallet, Silly Bandz, rubber ducks, quarters and more. At the age of 10, I settled on stickers and stories. It’s really the only thing that stuck. I remember being asked, ""What are three words that describe you?"" in the fifth grade, and I decided spunky, sticker-collector and storyteller was the only combination that fit (this stuck for about seven years). Despite my parents not engaging in leisurely reading or writing, I proudly claim that I come from a lineage of storytellers. While many kids were enjoying books on Greek gods and goddesses, my parents fed me a diet of oral stories of Hindu myths and legends. I may not subscribe to every single literary tradition, but I continue to have a profound connection with the travelers and keepers of knowledge my parents used to speak so fondly about. Stories became my way to observe and store the world I hope to remember through my senses.

I remember spending bus rides on the way to middle school talking about our days at home and telling stories about scraped knees and broken elbows (we were the original D1 yappers). I think about my senior year English class often; the place where we talked about everything from the morning coffee we would grab on the way to class to the meaning of friendship and community over COVID-19. Perhaps that’s why I first started writing. I would cling to the words of Toni Morrison, Jhumpa Lahiri and Arundhati Roy, captivated by their skill in crafting narratives from their own experiences.

While some choose to collect vintage toy cars, and I choose to collect conversations with people, we both capture, alter and curate the things we collect, all with the purpose of showcasing our lives. Hopkins has, in so many ways, nurtured my need for stories and community. The people I have learned from, whether that be my roommates, friends, professors or staff, have all generously opened the door to their own collections of life and memories. It has been enriching to be around people who so graciously share their lives with me. I hope that my door opens to a collection of people, stories and words bursting at their seams, so much so that the world can bear witness to the people and places I hold close to my heart. I love to listen, I love to share and I love to write. The beauty of storytelling and collecting lies in its capacity to evolve with you. What a beautiful life to live and a life to love.

youth football equipment. Engineers at the center use a pneumatic ram for high-speed impacts to the helmet at a range of angles and locations. (Photo courtesy of National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment) By MICHAEL ROVETTO and ABBEY WELTMAN Capital News Service The risk of head injury in youth tackle football can never be eliminated. But around the country, changes in rules and standards are being introduced to try to reduce those risks. Some leagues are appointing special coaches to watch for injuries during games. Football equipment is being reexamined. In July, the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) announced it was nearing approval of a standard specifically for youth football helmets — a first. Until recent years, “we haven’t known enough about those risks at the youth level to do anything much with the standard other than make sure that there were sizes that fit,” said Mike Oliver, executive director and general counsel for NOCSAE. As research has progressed, it has become possible to create a “more tailored” standard for youth helmets, Oliver said. Under NOCSAE’s proposal, helmets for children ages 5-13 would weigh no more than 3.5 pounds or “about half of what most helmets are currently on the market,” said Dr. Robert Cantu, NOCSAE vice president and chairman of its Scientific Advisory Committee. Lighter helmets will protect youth players from concussions, Cantu said, explaining that children’s necks are weaker than the necks of adults. When children fall backward to the turf, their heads are more likely to snap back. This rapid reverse movement can cause more damage than the original impact. “The falls to the ground [produce] as many or more concussions as the actual hits while they were hitting standing up,” said Cantu, who also is clinical diagnostics and therapeutics leader of the Boston University CTE Center. NOCSAE sets safety standards for the sports equipment industry, but it could be years before lighter helmets approved by NOCSAE are on the heads of youth players. Even after approval of a new standard, it will take a year or more before the youth helmet is available. Cantu predicted improved safety for all young players when the helmets are widely in use, especially for the youngest players, ages 5-9, whose necks are weakest. The new helmets will be the “real deal and very important,” he said. Overall, safety measures for youth football have been slow to develop. In 2015, USA Football, the governing body of the sport, announced a recommended limit of 30 minutes of contact a day and four team practices each week. In 2019, Pop Warner Little Scholars, the largest youth football organization in the country, eliminated the “three-point stance” for players from ages 5 to 10, a change aimed at reducing the clashing of helmets at the line of scrimmage. Some leagues have gone beyond the rules and guidelines of national organizations. In the Tualatin Valley Youth Football League, located in communities near Portland, Oregon, officials have adopted rules, including the appointment of a league director of player safety, and have added an app to track players’ injuries. Brian Lyles, commissioner of the Tualatin Valley league said, “Leagues that don’t adopt this view of player safety and safety first — unfortunately, it affects all of us. … If you don’t adopt that, you’re going to struggle bringing people in.” Each team in the Tualatin Valley league is assigned a safety coordinator who is responsible for identifying players who display symptoms of an injury. The coordinator has the authority to pull players from games and practices if warranted. Every coach also is certified through USA Football’s Heads Up program. This includes training in concussion recognition and response, heat preparedness and hydration, and sudden cardiac arrest. Coaches also are trained to properly fit equipment and teach safer techniques for tackling and blocking. Safety coordinators are prohibited from acting as offensive or defensive coordinators and head coaches. Starting next season, league rules will prohibit safety coordinators from having any role in coaching any team in the league, Lyles said. The change ensures the safety coaches only have allegiance to player safety, he added. The Tualatin Valley league partnered with the Positive Coaching Alliance, an organization that promotes beneficial youth sports experiences. Casey U’Ren, a PCA vice president, said the Tualatin Valley league is one of many youth sports programs working with PCA to take more progressive action prioritizing player safety. Flag football is another way some coaches and parents are trying to make the game safer. Flag, in which players grab strips of fabric instead of each other, is expanding rapidly. Toby Bourguet, founder of Tucson Turf, a youth flag football league in Tucson, Arizona, started his organization in part as a tackle alternative for his six children. Two of his sons now play football at Arizona State University. “I love tackle football as much as any person you will talk to. But not as much as I love my children and their health,” Bourguet said. Growth in flag leagues and safety initiatives have been a response in part to mounting medical evidence of the dangers related to taking head impacts over many seasons. A study published by Boston University researchers last March found repetitive blows to the head like the ones that occur in youth football can lead to “impulsive behavior and other thinking-related problems.” The study, published in the journal Brain Communications, shows children are at greater risk if they start playing tackle football at an early age or play for more than 11 years. More research needs to be done to understand all the risks, Cantu said. He predicts scientists eventually will be able to measure precisely the trauma each hit to the head delivers to a player. “From that,” he said, “we’re going to be able to know: Is somebody reaching a kind of a yellow zone that is getting close to the red light?” Steve Rowson, associate professor of biomedical engineering at Virginia Tech, director of the Virginia Tech helmet lab and member of the scientific advisory committee for NOCSAE, said genetic factors could possibly predispose some people who take head blows to suffer concussion symptoms and later-life diseases such as dementia. Rowson said that isn’t well understood now. “Why does one person get hurt when they get hit in the head like this and not another?” Rowson asked. He said more factors need to be studied to determine how they increase risks to players. Advances in research over the next decade will continue to change the rules and influence public opinion about the safety of the sport for children, according to advocates such as Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation. Nowinski, a former Harvard University football player turned WWE professional wrestler, sustained multiple concussions during his football and wrestling careers. His organization urges parents not to allow their children to play tackle football until the age of 14. “Youth tackle,” he said, “I don’t think should exist. “I don’t think there’s any reason to play tackle football before high school, before 14,” Nowiniski said. “But I’m open to a compromise if we can protect the youngest and most vulnerable brains.” Please read the first part of the series here.

Though the woman claimed to have several businesses, including décor, consulting and investment realty enterprises, investigators found none of the businesses had a record of business tax filings, and the woman spent nearly $20,000 on luxury goods and travel to a resort within one month of receiving the PPP loan. In another case, a Prince George’s County man fraudulently obtained $1 million in PPP funds and attempted to obtain more than $3 million in PPP and EIDL funds by purporting to have a transportation business, car sales business and an assisted living facility. IRS tax records showed none of these companies reported paying wages to any employees. While the PPP and EIDL programs have ceased accepting loan applications—the PPP ended in May 2021 and the SBA halted applications for EIDL loans in January 2022—investigators are still working to uncover pandemic fraud, and so far, there appears to be no end in sight. Riley said that although these programs are no longer operational, the volume and speed at which the loans were disbursed means investigators must now work to determine where the fraud is and hold those responsible for the fraud accountable. In August 2022, Congress extended the statute of limitations for PPP and EIDL fraud from five years to 10 years, signaling its intent to crack down on pandemic-related fraud. “I think that’s a clear indication from Congress and the president that Washington is committed to the long-term prosecution of those who are responsible for this sort of ‘once in a generation’ fraud,” Riley said. Investigators are also seeing a connection between the prosecution of COVID-19 fraud and other crimes, such as firearms being recovered during the execution of a search warrant that the individual was not permitted to have, Riley said. Purported businesses such as these received millions in federal aid during the pandemic — despite many not actually existing, except on COVID-19 loan applications. In Maryland, the state’s COVID-19 Fraud Strike Force has prosecuted dozens of loan fraud cases, with more cases pending and millions of dollars more in potential fraud believed likely. In its year and a half of operation, the Maryland COVID-19 Fraud Strike Force has charged 33 defendants in COVID-19 fraud schemes, totaling alleged fraud exceeding $55 million, a spokesperson for the Maryland U.S. Attorney’s Office said. The office has 19 active cases pending, with 19 defendants and approximately $30 million in potential fraud. Pandemic fraud-related criminal investigations and prosecutions have “significantly increased,” the spokesperson said, up from the Maryland strike force’s August totals of 20 defendants prosecuted for $40 million in fraud. But Maryland’s findings are just a fraction of potential COVID-19 fraud suspected nationwide, officials say. The most recent federal fraud estimate by the Small Business Administration’s Office of Inspector General found the SBA disbursed more than $200 billion in potentially fraudulent COVID-19 aid, including loans through the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. At least 17% of all COVID-19 PPP and EIDL funds were disbursed to potentially fraudulent actors, the OIG found. Paul Riley, deputy chief of the fraud and public corruption section of the district of Maryland U.S. Attorney’s Office, said these programs have seen large-scale fraud. “It’s no secret that there’s been huge amounts of fraud in the context of the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loans,” Riley said. “In terms of volume, I think that it’s a tremendous problem, and we are noticing no shortage of fraud here in Maryland.” Riley, who co-leads the Maryland COVID-19 Fraud Strike Force, said investigators call those who submit the fraudulent loan applications ‘facilitators.’ These individuals submit loan applications with the help of co-conspirators, who may have shell businesses or dormant businesses and often provide fake tax documents and fabricated bank statements to obtain the loans, Riley said. Riley said the strike force has observed a significant number of individuals involved with facilitating the fraudulent loans. “What we’ve seen is that frequently, the facilitators are assisting with preparing the fabricated documents — whether it’s the tax documents, the fake bank statements and so on — because as the facilitator, they have their own arguable ‘expertise’ as to how to execute the fraud scheme,” Riley said. Maryland’s strike force is one of five national specialized COVID-19 strike forces selected by the U.S. Justice Department to investigate and prosecute fraud, waste and abuse relating to pandemic relief granted by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Riley said Maryland’s strike force works with other law enforcement partners, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Labor and the Office of Inspector General, to uncover potential COVID-19 fraud cases in addition to fielding calls and mail from the public about COVID-19-related fraud suspicions. “Maryland’s strike force has proven through dedicated resources, partnerships with local, state and federal law enforcement, that those who would steal from American taxpayers are held accountable and our efforts to investigate and prosecute'}]"
