hospitalized Friday after four people were struck by a vehicle Thursday in Gloucester County. Two kids, a parent and a crossing guard were hit while in a crosswalk shortly after 8:30 a.m. at Hessian and Grove avenues in the borough of National Park near National Park Elementary School, according to police. All four were taken to Cooper University Hospital, Camden. Driver Lanielle M. Phelps, 40, of West Deptford, was allegedly intoxicated when police say she struck the victims. A public defender representing Phelps did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. A mother and girl were treated and released from Cooper, while a boy and the crossing guard remain at the hospital, according to West Deptford Police Chief John Chambers. Family members reported that both patients were listed in stable condition, the chief said Friday. Phelps, who remained at the crash scene, admitted to police that she took prescription medication earlier in the morning before the crash, according to the affidavit of probable cause filed with her charges. Officers conducted a series of field sobriety tests and her blood alcohol content was measured at 0.00%, police stated. She also agreed to provide blood and urine samples for testing. A check of her cellphone revealed she was not using the device at the time of the incident, police noted. Phelps was charged with four counts of second-degree assault by auto, a count of second-degree endangering the welfare of a child and driving while intoxicated. Phelps had a child in her vehicle at the time of the crash, police said. Investigators have recovered surveillance footage of the incident, Chambers noted. She was placed in Salem County Correctional Facility pending court hearings. Our journalism needs your support. Please subscribe today to NJ.com. Matt Gray may be reached at mgray@njadvancemedia.com.

Sign up for email newsletters E-Edition Moving out of Trenton became a spiritual departure recently as two sisters contemplated life in the Hamilton Twp. suburb of Yardville.They imagined no problems with parking.“Praise, Jesus. We have our own driveway and plenty of parking,” said Joyce Levy, awash in sunlight while standing on the porch of her Franklin St., Trenton home. The pair moved out of their well-kept home on Thanksgiving Eve. They have returned sporadically to collect odds and ends.Lucy Samuels, who shared the home with her older sister for the past two years, added similar praise when she considered a clean street in their new Yardville home.“Thank God. I won’t have to get up nearly every morning to pick up trash and sweep the street. And, there won’t be any noise,” Samuels said. Samuels, too, had celebrated the American Dream when she purchased a home on Williams St.The couple, who worked in the healthcare field for nearly 30 years, actually Joyce still works part-time, could not contain their joy of leaving a challenged street.And, the quiet? “Oh, you would not believe the quiet,” Samuels added hallelujah-like. They christened the new home on Thanksgiving as family members came from Maryland, Virginia and Florida for a celebration of the newly-purchased residence.Levy, who arrived in the Trenton area in 1984, her sister followed five years after, said she purchased the Franklin St. home in April 1994, a time when most of her neighbors listed as Italian. Levy, black, and blessed with a strong Jamaican accent, remembered the cleanliness of the block, far different than a current condition. “The block was beautiful,” Levy recalled, noting that she matched neighborhood ambitions that required neatness, including the memorable Chambersburg activity of sweeping and water-washing sidewalks.“You had to sweep every day. And, you had to put out your garbage a certain way. I didn’t mind that at all. But it was hard being the only Black family on the block. Sometimes the other boys would gang up on my son. And early on, an Italian neighbor was so angry about us being here, said he wanted to burn our house down.”“My older son worked nights back then. Since he was home all day, neighbors thought we were a welfare family. But we worked, have always worked.”Levy recalled an exodus of Italians and others as the neighborhood flipped. Blacks and Latinos arrived and the former Chambersburg stakeholders moved out to Hamilton and other suburban enclaves. Still, Levy had managed to change some minds and hearts. That neighbor who threatened arson, suffered a life challenge. A health issue required amputation of his legs.“And his wife left him,” Levy recalled. She did what any, self-respecting, spiritually-based person would do.“I would cook for him occasionally, made him meals when I could. It would do me no good to match his not liking me. I’m not like that.”The sisters said they look forward to life in the diverse neighborhood, retirement, clean streets and peace.“I get up this morning and we pray. And then we had breakfast.

story as additional information becomes available. Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified the spokesman for North Carolina A&T, he is Todd Simmons. George Santos is an anomaly among lawmakers when it comes to fabricating his education credentials, based on a USA TODAY review of his fellow freshmen members of Congress. But it turns out those credentials are rarely vetted. The Long Island congressman claimed to have degrees from Baruch College and New York University, neither of which have a record of Santos earning a degree – a fact only publicized after he was elected in November. Educational background checks for 91 out of 93 freshman members held up, in most cases for all of their cited degrees. About a dozen universities did not respond and the two discrepancies that emerged both were minor compared to Santos’. In reaching out to 139 schools named in official biographies, campaign materials and news articles by the new senators and congress members, reporters heard back from dozens that few media outlets, sometimes none, had tried to verify the then-candidates’ educational credentials during the past year. “We firmly believe in the importance of checking credentials and resume claims of all individuals who run for public office. You are the first and only reporter to request this info from A&T,” Todd Simmons, spokesman at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University wrote in confirming the degree of Rep. Jonathan Jackson, a Democrat elected this year to represent Illinois’ 1st Congressional District. One of the discrepancies was Rep. Mary Sattler Peltola, D-Alaska, whose congressional biography states she attended the University of Northern Colorado from 1991 to 1994. The university confirmed her attendance, but only from 1991 to spring 1993. And it added in an email, “our records reflect that no entity has requested this information except for you, today.” Late Friday, Sam Erickson, a spokesperson for Peltola, said the representative has never claimed to earn a degree and “ended her studies to focus on addressing problems at home in the state legislature."" ""We\'re unsure and are investigating why some websites claim she attended NCU from \'91 - \'94,"" Erickson said. ""To our knowledge, she was there until \'93 and spent the fall of \'94 working on a Republican state house race."" Rep. Troy Carter, D-Louisiana, stated on his congressional website that he earned a Master of Business Administration from Holy Cross University. A June 2021 press release from the institution – actually named University of Holy Cross – said Carter earned a Master of Science in Management, a degree that typically takes less time to complete than an MBA. The private university in Louisiana confirmed to USA TODAY that its news release was correct. Though the differences might seem superficial, an MBA carries more prestige, said John Byrne, the editor in chief of Poets and Quants, a publication focused on business schools. Byrne said masters of science in management programs are typically geared toward people with less work experience, are easier to get into and don\'t usually require the same depth of study as MBA programs. Those in the business field would “know the difference immediately” between the two degrees, he said, adding, “there’s no doubt that the MBA is a more prestigious degree and it’s a degree that would get you a better job.” Following USA TODAY’s inquiries, Carter’s page was updated to the correct degree and university name. “The discrepancy was a staff error and has since been corrected,” said Sara Severens, a spokeswoman for Carter. Revelations about inaccuracies in Santos’ education and employment background broke open after he was elected, in an investigation by the New York Times. The discrepancies, which he has called “embellishments,” have led to criminal investigations, calls for a House Ethics Committee probe and calls for his resignation. They also have caused political officials and the media to take a hard look at their vetting processes. In finger-pointing about missed Santos red flags, Democratic party officials pointed back at the media. Jason Kaplan, a campaign consultant for Santos’ Democratic opponent Robert Zimmerman tweeted that, “we’ve been screaming it from the rooftops since September.” The Democratic Congressional Committee distributed its research book – traditionally sent to reporters and party officials – well before the election. It raised questions about some of Santos’ record, but not all. His college credentials, for instance, were not questioned. New York University sends third party requests to a clearinghouse to process validation requests, potentially a roadblock that could explain how Santos’ record went unnoticed. “My biggest concern is that this story gets forgotten,” Zimmerman said. “We need to toughen the laws that hold you accountable for lying on your ethics forms and invest in the local media because journalism is the front line defense to this.” Vetting college credentials is traditionally a simple process for media and political researchers alike. Still, several universities either didn’t respond to USA TODAY, demanded formal written state records requests or declined to provide information citing federal privacy laws – laws that allow people to put a hold on their own files. Among the schools that did not verify degrees by the deadline for this story: Yale University and the Morehouse School of Medicine. Yale later confirmed degrees for Rep. Daniel Goldman, D-N.Y.; Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-California; Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I. and Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio. \'Stunning\' lies: Nassau County district attorney to investigate GOP Rep.-elect George Santos The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill confirmed a 2009 law degree for Rep. Jeff Jackson, D-N.C., but not for Rep. Rob Menendez, a Democrat who represents New Jersey and is the son of Sen. Rob Menendez. The congressman’s staff later sent a certificate of his degree from the university confirming he had earned a bachelor’s degree in 2008. Middle Tennessee State University said the university would only answer questions about Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn. with his permission. A spokesman for Ogles did not respond to questions about whether the congressman had put a hold on the records or whether he would lift it. The office later shared a photo of Ogle’s bachelor’s degree certificate as proof. Nova Southeastern University, where Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Florida, stated he earned his law degree, said it was the institution’s policy to “not provide information on its students without the expressed consent and authorization of the student(s) in question.” After this story\'s publication, Moskowitz and his office contacted USA TODAY and the university. Nova Southeastern has since confirmed that Moskowitz graduated from its school of law in 2007. Cornell University also provided information about some, but not all of its graduates. It confirmed that Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, had earned an MBA and Master of Public Health in 2015, and another master’s degree in 2016. But the university initially said that it had “no information available” on Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M. The university had touted Stansbury as a graduate in June 2021, however, when she won a special election to fill a vacancy left by Deb Haaland, who became secretary of the Interior. After USA TODAY contacted Stansbury’s office, the university confirmed she earned a master’s degree in sociology in 2007. Mike Klocke, spokesman for the University of the Pacific-Stockton said it was news to them that an alumnus had just been elected to Congress. The campus then located California’s newly minted representative John Duarte, R-Calif. on their MBA rolls. Some universities sent reporters to the National Student Clearinghouse, a non-profit based in Virginia that performs degree verification for employers and alumni, for a $14.95 per search fee and only with the applicant’s permission. The service has drawn the ire of online reviewers, who filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau. “I\'m now being arbitrarily charged $13 for a glimpse at a pdf proving my degree\'s existence.” one user wrote. “This kind of service is easily offered by universities for free (and it WAS free until my school partnered with SCH), as students have already paid tremendous sums of money for their degree. Unnecessary middleman businesses like Student Clearinghouse should be ashamed of their own existence. This is a straight up ransom.” The nonprofit reported about $80 million in revenue in 2021, according to IRS records. A company spokesman said it “needs to charge a fee to offset the time and expense to create and upkeep the verification technology that helps institutions focus on their mission and to support students.” He noted that the service claims to have saved institutions $750 million annually and added that media or other interested parties can still contact universities directly to verify credentials. The freshmen class in the House and Senate holds a wide variety of educational credentials. Eight members of the new class graduated from military schools, including West Point, the U.S. Naval Academy in Maryland and the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado. Representatives Patrick Ryan, D-N.Y., Wesley Hunt, R-Tex. and John James, R-Mich. all graduated as members of the 2004 class at West Point, according to university'}]"

When I had brushed my teeth after dinner, I discovered that my battery-powered toothbrush was out of juice, so I tossed it into the garbage. Could it be? Could it have come back to life in there? I slowly opened the lid. Bob and the dogs moved in closer for a better look. We all took a deep breath. And sure enough, there it was - a vibrating pink toothbrush carrying on at the bottom of the can. I picked it up and turned it off. We refreshed our wine glasses, and all four of us returned to the couch to finish watching Dave Chapelle. Iâ\x80\x99ll call the electrician tomorrow about the hole in our bathroom ceiling. Anyhow, happy Thanksgiving.'}]"

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:14 am Namkeen owners Usman Chaudhry and wife Amena Chaudhri sit in front of their restaurant’s storefront on Chatham’s Main Street. Namkeen was featured on News 12 as part of Tony Caputo’s “Best of New Jersey” segment last month. CHATHAM - Namkeen, a Halal chicken restaurant located at 233 Main St., became the talk of the area for a bit after being exhibited on Tony Caputo’s News 12 segment, “Best of New Jersey,” on Tuesday, July 25. “Best of New Jersey” is a weekly bit where Caputo highlights a small restaurant in the state, trying out some of its delicacies on camera and speaking with the restaurant’s owners. For the last week of July, his journey brought him to Main Street. Namkeen was opened in 2020 in Chatham by Usman Chaudhry and his wife, Amena Chaudhri, who were looking to bring hot chicken to the community while adding a bit of flair from their home country of Pakistan. The two found success in their new business, and opened up a second location last year in New York City. According to Amena Chaudhri, Caputo’s team contacted the restaurant a few days before he came by, and after accepting being on the segment, the restaurant got to work preparing for Caputo’s arrival. The segment was split into four different clips, and during each clip, Caputo would try a new food on the menu, ranging from Nashville hot chicken to waffles. Additionally, Caputo would speak with both Amena Chaudhri and the restaurant’s co-owner, husband Usman Chaudhry, about both the food and their backgrounds. The clips were shown individually throughout the morning, and the full segment, which combined the four clips, was broadcast at noon. According to Amena Chaudhri, the first clip of the day was filmed at 4 a.m., while Namkeen normally opens at 11 a.m. She said that Caputo was an easy conversationalist. Caputo appeared to enjoy Namkeen’s selection, though he did admit he wasn’t used to super-hot food. Business boomed in the immediate aftermath, according to Amena Chaudhri. Additionally, the restaurant had both new customers who had seen them on News 12 and wanted to check them out, and returning customers just popping in to congratulate the pair, Usman Chaudhry said. “Often times anyone who comes and eats, often praises the whole area, as it’s very family oriented and very safe,” said Amena Chaudhri. “It was a remarkable experience to be a part of Tony’s segment, and a great honor to meet him and his team,” added Usman Chaudhry. “We had a great time sharing our stories, experiences and our passion for our restaurant.” Namkeen has plans to open a third storefront in Metuchen. The pair also own Chashni, a chai tea cafe also on Chatham’s Main Street.

The protests are stemming from a series of issues, so it may be difficult to keep track. Here is a look at the drama that has been following the national coffee chain and an explanation of why so many people are not buying from the brand. Starbucks and the union organizing its workers are now suing each other in federal court over a social media post that was sent out by the workers\' union supporting Palestinians in light of the Israel-Hamas war. The company sued Starbucks Workers United in federal court in October alleging trademark infringement after the union sent out a social media post saying ""Solidarity with Palestine!"" a few weeks after the Hamas attack against Israel, which killed 1,200 people and made hostages of 240 people. Starbucks Workers United countersued Starbucks, asking a federal court in Pennsylvania to rule that it can continue using its name and similar logo and saying ""Starbucks defamed the union by implying that it supports terrorism and violence."" Starbucks distanced itself from the workers\' union\'s pro-Palestinian stance, putting out an official statement that read: “We unequivocally condemn these acts of terrorism, hate and violence, and disagree with the statements and views expressed by Workers United and its members.” Starbucks also said in the statement that the union social media post led to angry and hurt customers confronting employees in their stores and sending graphic and violent messages to company customer service staff.

Starbucks Workers United, which represents thousands of baristas at 340 locations nationwide, is still trying to get its first union contract.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken will return to Israel on Monday after completing a six-nation sweep across the region aimed at preventing the war from spreading, and he’s bringing back critical words from a neighbor. State-run media in Egypt, one of the countries Blinken visited, reported that President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi told him Israel’s pounding of Gaza last week exceeded ""the right of self-defense"" and turned into ""a collective punishment."" The conflict, which has killed more than 4,000 people, has raised concern that it could spark a wider regional war. In Cairo, Blinken once again underscored President Joe Biden\'s position that the U.S. would support Israel “today, tomorrow and every day,” but also said Israel must take “every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians.” The last topic is particularly sensitive not only because of the respect for human life the U.S. and Israel share but also because a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza could inflame public opinion in the Arab world, possibly hurting efforts to improve relations between Israel and other Middle East countries that have been warming up to that notion. Some analysts have said sabotaging those efforts was a major goal of Hamas’ attack. The growing desperation in Gaza for water, food, fuel and medicines after Israel cut those off could play into Hamas\' hands. Blinken told reporters there was a common theme to the feedback he heard from Arab leaders during his trip: ""A determination of shared view that we have to do everything possible to make sure this doesn’t spread to other places, a shared view to safeguard innocent lives, a shared view to get assistance to Palestinians in Gaza who need it, and we’re working very much on that."" The Associated Press, citing a senior administration official, reported Sunday that Biden is considering a trip to Israel in the coming days but no travel has been finalized. The move would be considered a powerful symbol of sympathy and support following the brutal attack by Hamas, but also potentially viewed as tone-deaf by Arab nations as civilian casualties mount in Gaza.

Developments: ∎ Ambassador David Satterfield was appointed Special Envoy for Middle East Humanitarian Issues, where he will focus on ensuring ""life-saving assistance can reach vulnerable people throughout the Middle East,"" the State Department announced Sunday. ∎ Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, where thousands have sought safety, said it would bury 100 bodies in a mass grave after its morgue overflowed. ""An unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding under our eyes,"" said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, adding that it can no longer provide humanitarian assistance. ∎ The United Nations said about 1 million Gaza residents have been displaced in just a week, about half of them finding refuge in U.N. schools and other facilities where water supplies are diminishing. ∎ Pope Francis renewed his appeal for peace, restraint and release of the hostages: ""I strongly demand that children, the elderly, women, and all civilians are not victims of the conflict."" Israeli authorities notified 155 families their loved ones were being held by Hamas on Sunday, when the war intensified as the number of Palestinians who have evacuated northern Gaza surpassed 600,000. Israel has ordered more than 1 million Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza ahead of an impending ground invasion, creating a humanitarian crisis that has brought protests from the U.N. and around the world. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said thousands had already left despite efforts by Hamas to slow the process. To help expedite it, the IDF vowed not to carry out operations along the primary road south from northern Gaza from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sunday and encouraged residents to take advantage of that window of time. ""Be assured, Hamas leaders have already ensured their safety and that of their families,"" the IDF said in social media posts. Hagari told the families of hostages the military is making every effort possible to free them. “To the families of the hostages, I know that for you every second is an eternity. We will do everything to bring your loved ones home,” Hagari said in a translation by the Times of Israel. In an interview with ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday, President Joe Biden warned Israel not to reoccupy Gaza, saying it would be ""a big mistake."" Biden, who spoke with CBS\' Scott Pelley, said: ""What happened in Gaza, in my view, is Hamas and the extreme elements of Hamas don’t represent all the Palestinian people. And I think that it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza again."" But ""taking out the extremists"" there, Biden added, ""is a necessary requirement."" Biden also said he supported a humanitarian corridor to aid civilians impacted by the conflict and to allow people to leave Gaza. Secretary-General of the U.N. António Guterres on Sunday made a humanitarian appeal on X, formerly known as Twitter, asking Hamas to release hostages without conditions, and asking Israel to allow fast and ""unimpeded"" aid for the civilians of Gaza. ""Each one of these two objectives are valid in themselves,"" he said in the message. ""They should not become bargaining chips and they must be implemented because it is the right thing to do."" Guterres said in a statement that Gaza is running out of water, electricity and other essential supplies. The U.N. said it has food, medical supplies, and fuel stocks in Egypt, Jordan, the West Bank and Israel, which can be dispatched within a couple hours but officials need to make sure they can travel safely through Gaza. On Sunday evening, the White House released a statement condemning the stabbing murder of a 6-year-old boy in Illinois in what officials are calling a hate crime. A 71-year-old Illinois man was accused Sunday of fatally stabbing a 6-year-old and seriously injuring a 32-year-old woman. Authorities believe it was a targeted attack in response to the Israel-Hamas war. The suspect was identified as Joseph Czuba, of Plainfield Township, and was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crime, and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, according to the sheriff\'s office. “The child’s Palestinian Muslim family came to America seeking what we all seek—a refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace,” Biden said in a release. “This horrific act of hate has no place in America.” Biden urged Americans to come together and reject Islamophobia. Pope Francis on Sunday made an appeal to establish humanitarian corridors to provide aid to people under siege in Gaza, and for Hamas to release its hostages, according to Reuters. ""I forcefully ask that children, the sick, the elderly and women, and all civilians do not become the victims of the conflict,"" he said during his weekly address in St. Peter\'s square. ""May humanitarian rights be respected, above all in Gaza, where it is urgent and necessary to guarantee humanitarian corridors to help the entire population,"" he said. On Friday the Vatican offered to mediate in the conflict. A day after Iran’s foreign minister warned Israel that its attacks on Gaza could fuel expansion of the war across the Middle East, Sen. Lindsey Graham warned Iran that it could become a U.S. military target if it attempts to expand the war. Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian had said if Lebanon-based militant Hezbollah, funded by Iran, joins the battle it would ""cause a huge earthquake"" in Israel. “While a great number of Palestinians are being killed by the Zionist regime on a daily basis, the US administration calls on others to show self-restraint,"" Amirabdollahian said. Graham, speaking Sunday on ""Meet the Press,"" applauded President Joe Biden for his strong support of Israel and said the Israeli military was trying to destroy Hamas while protecting as many Palestinians as possible. ""Here\'s my message,"" the Republican from South Carolina said. ""If Hezbollah, which is a proxy of Iran, launches a massive attack on Israel, I would ... introduce a resolution in the United States Senate to allow military action by the United States in conjunction with Israel to knock Iran out of the oil business. Iran, if you escalate this war, we\'re coming for you."" See how US Navy ships in the Mediterranean are positioned to support Israel The U.S. and British governments are pushing for the Rafah crossing into Egypt to be opened so their citizens can escape the war and humanitarian aid can come into Gaza, the BBC reported Sunday.

officers while off-duty last month.City of Atlantic City A 36-year-old Atlantic City police detective who allegedly admitted he was “a little sauced” has been charged with eluding his fellow police officers after authorities say he drove through multiple red lights, weaved in and out of traffic and nearly struck a patrol vehicle while off-duty last month. Fariyd A. Holmes claimed he was waiting to be picked up by his niece, but surveillance footage shows a man behind the wheel of the vehicle Sept. 21, a criminal complaint states. The pursuit started to unfold at about 9:45 p.m. that day when a police officer saw a vehicle travel through a red light at the intersection of Tennessee and Arctic Avenues in Atlantic City, the court document says. The driver then began to weave in and out of traffic as the officer followed the vehicle south on Atlantic Avenue, nearly striking another patrol vehicle. Officers activated their lights and sirens and attempted to pull over the fleeing vehicle before it blew through another red light at the corner of Baltic and Arkansas Avenues and accelerated onto the Atlantic City Expressway, the affidavit said. By then, police had obtained the vehicle’s license plate information and decided to call off the pursuit. After finding that the vehicle was registered to Holmes, a sergeant tried to call the detective’s cell phone, according to the court document. That’s when Holmes told the story about his niece and allegedly made the comment about being “a little sauced.” He also declined to tell his colleague where either he or his niece were, the court document states. Investigators confirmed Holmes was behind the wheel by matching surveillance footage from Atlantic City and license plate reader footage from the Pleasantville Toll Plaza on the Atlantic City Expressway, according to the charging document. Holmes is seen wearing a white dress shirt, a watch and talking on a cell phone at the toll plaza, the affidavit said. Holmes, of the Mays Landing section of Hamilton, has been suspended without pay, an Atlantic City police spokesman said Wednesday. Hired as public employee in 2015, Holmes is paid an annual salary of $87,266, according to state pension records. “The Atlantic City Police Department immediately made notification to the Atlantic County Prosecutor’s Office to review and investigate the circumstances surrounding the attempted motor vehicle stop of a vehicle that was registered to Detective Fariyd Holmes,” Atlantic City police said in a statement.”The investigation led to criminal charges being filed against Holmes.” Holmes is a 2005 graduate of Atlantic City High School and received a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from Stockton University in 2011, according to the City of Atlantic City. His attorney, Louis Barbone, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment Wednesday. Our journalism needs your support. Please subscribe today to NJ.com.

TO THE EDITOR: There are so many reasons that an 80-unit assisted living and memory care facility is not right for Columbia and Elm in Florham Park. The intersection was created when Columbia was a country road. It is now a 50 mph major thoroughfare in Morris County. I am facing a minor dilemma, and I am curious how other parents in this area might be dealing with it as well.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:14 am MOUNT OLIVE TWP. – The anonymous parents of an unnamed student who attended Mount Olive High School (MOHS) last year filed a lawsuit against the township’s K-12 School District Board of Education, claiming that two other students sexually assaulted the plaintiffs’ daughter during the 2022-23 school year. Also listed as defendants are the high school, its Principal Kevin Stansberry, former Superintendent Robert Zywicki and current Superintendent Sumit Bangia. The suit was filed in the state’s Superior Court in Morristown Wednesday, Nov. 29. Board of Education Attorney Marc Zitomer said when reached for comment that he was in the process of reviewing the lawsuit and is not prepared to comment at this time. The plaintiffs’ attorney Eric Kahn, when reached for comment, said the lawsuit speaks for itself and he cannot comment further. The suit does not clarify if the alleged victim, named in the lawsuit with the initials “M.S.,” is currently a student at MOHS, but the suit mentions M.S. as currently being a minor. Two students who allegedly committed the assaults are listed in the lawsuit as “A.P.” and “S.C.” These two students allegedly engaged in improper sex acts, sexual assault, sexual contact and sexual abuse of M.S. on school grounds in or about September 2022 to April 2023, and at various times until M.S. reported the alleged abuse on or about Monday, April 24, the suit says. The suit further alleges that the school board, the high school, Stansberry, Zywicki and/or Bangia, in the exercise of due care, should have known that A.P. and S.P. had the propensity for sexual contact and/or sexual abuse of other students such as M.S. The suit also alleges that these defendants recklessly, negligently, and/or carelessly maintained custody, supervision, control, and protection and failed to provide a safe environment for children placed in their care by virtue of their authority. The defendants, the suit alleges, acted with gross negligence in the prevention of unwanted sexual contact against M.S. by failing to reasonably care for her supervision and protection. M.S.’ parents, listed anonymously in the suit as “J.S.” and “J.S.,” are demanding on behalf of their minor daughter judgment against the defendants, compensatory damages, punitive damages, interest, costs of the suit, attorney’s fees and other relief that the court deems just and equitable, the suit says.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:14 am MOUNT OLIVE TWP. – A 17-year-old and 18-year-old were arrested and taken into custody by State Police on Wednesday, April 19, after they allegedly stole a car in Roxbury, then threatened to inflict harm at Mount Olive High School, a threat that forced the K-12 school district’s schools to go into lockdown until early afternoon. The individuals, who remain unidentified, were arrested at 11:56 a.m. that morning, when a State Trooper conducted a motor vehicle stop on the Garden State Parkway southbound at mile post 64.8 in Stafford Township, according to a statement issued late Wednesday night by the New Jersey State Police. The stop occurred in Ocean County, about 100 miles from Mount Olive. The individuals were removed from the car and arrested when the State Trooper learned about the stolen vehicle out of Roxbury, according to the State Police. The Morris County Prosecutor’s Office is serving as the lead agency in the matter, and will be filing charges pending further investigation, according to the statement. Meanwhile, Acting School Superintendent Sumit Bangia issued a memo Wednesday morning to parents announcing the classes and afternoon activities would resume as normal. “No immediate threat to students exists at this time. All school activities will resume as scheduled including after-school activities,” Bangia said, although the “heightened law enforcement presence will remain at all buildings. According to the Prosecutor’s Office, at about 10:30 a.m. the office was notified by township police of a possible school threat. Township police had also been made aware of the theft of a motor vehicle out of Roxbury Township, and there was a potential threat to Mount Olive High School. The Mount Olive Police Department, with the assistance of the Morris County Sheriff’s Office started an investigation, and an alert was put out for the stolen vehicle. As a result, Mount Olive High School was placed into lockdown and a security perimeter was established, while other schools in the district were placed into shelter in place. According to the Prosecutor’s Office, once it was determined that there was no threat, the Mount Olive High School lockdown was lifted at about 1 p.m. According to police, the car’s occupants had “expressed an intent to go to Mount Olive High School to harm students.” The suspects remain unidentified although they are both reportedly students at the high school. At least one of the suspects – and the exact number has not been given – also was said to have had a firearm. Also not confirmed is whether the suspects had driven to the high school campus brandishing weapons in the morning. The investigation remains ongoing. Those with any information about the investigation are asked to call the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office at (973) 285-6200 or the Mount Olive Police Department at (973) 691-0850.

Both outlets cited unnamed sources confirming Perry’s death.“Matthew was an incredibly gifted actor and an indelible part of the Warner Bros. Television Group family,” the company said in a statement. “The impact of his comedic genius was felt around the world, and his legacy will live on in the hearts of so many.

Perry, who starred as Chandler Bing, has died. He was 54. (AP Photo/Tina Fineberg, File)“Friends” ran from 1994 until 2004, winning one best comedy series Emmy Award in 2002. The cast notably banded together for later seasons to obtain a salary of $1 million per episode for each.By the “Friends” finale, Chandler is married to Cox’s Monica and they have a family, reflecting the journey of the core cast from single New Yorkers trying to figure their lives out to several of them married and starting families.The series was one of television’s biggest hits and has taken on a new life — and found surprising popularity with younger fans — in recent years on streaming services.Perry described reading the “Friends” script for the first time in his memoir, “Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing.”“It was as if someone had followed me around for a year, stealing my jokes, copying my mannerisms, photocopying my world-weary yet witty view of life. One character in particular stood out to me: it wasn’t that I thought I could ‘play’ Chandler. I ‘was’ Chandler.”Unknown at the time was the struggle Perry had with addiction and an intense desire to please audiences.“‘Friends’ was huge. I couldn’t jeopardize that. I loved the script. I loved my co-actors. I loved the scripts. I loved everything about the show but I was struggling with my addictions which only added to my sense of shame,” he wrote in his memoir. “I had a secret and no one could know.”“I felt like I was gonna die if the live audience didn’t laugh, and that’s not healthy for sure. But I could sometimes say a line and the audience wouldn’t laugh and I would sweat and sometimes go into convulsions,” Perry wrote. “If I didn’t get the laugh I was supposed to get I would freak out. I felt that every single night. This pressure left me in a bad place. I also knew of the six people making that show, only one of them was sick.”He recalled in his memoir that Aniston confronted him about being inebriated while filming.Actor Matthew Perry, best known for his role in the TV show “Friends,” has died at age 54, according to TMZ.

My performance never got better than when there was an audience there.”Perry was born Aug. 19, 1969, in Williamstown, Massachusetts.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:14 am Roberto LaRacca, owner of Farmtastic in Pine Plaza in Whippany, is closing the market’s doors on Tuesday, Oct. 13 after just a year and a half in business. LaRacca sited millions of dollars in lost revenue as the reason he must close the store, which had taken over the spot vacated by Pathmark years earlier. HANOVER TWP. – Farmtastic, the one-and-a-half-year-old Pine Plaza supermarket that was an offshoot of the Lake Hiawatha Foodtown, is closing its doors for good on Tuesday, Oct. 13. Store owner Roberto LaRaccha, 33, said he can’t make ends meet and has lost millions of dollars as he struggled to keep the store afloat. “Some weeks I lost $15,000 to $20,000,” LaRacca said. “The customers who did shop here love us, just not enough people shopped here.” Customers got wind something was up with the store last week when they saw supplies being taken out of the store but no deliveries. On Monday the deli/hot food section was bustling but the shelves were only about half stocked, if that. There had been speculation around town the shelf items were going to the Lake Hiawatha Foodtown in Parsippany-Troy Hills owned by LaRacca’s father. “No, they are not going there” LaRacca said. “We’re selling them outright.” LaRacca said he had high hopes for the business, which he saw as chance to step out on his own. Armed with money from his dad and some of his own, LaRacca opened Farmtastic in May 2014. The deli/hot foods section was an immediate hit and remains so today. “If only I could keep just that part open, let the shelved items go,” LaRacca mused. “Just section the store in two.” LaRacca said he is still speaking with the landlord but noted he has little to no hope any deal could be worked out to keep the store open. Hanover Township Mayor Ronald Francioli said it was a shame to see the store go. “Very sad. A great store servicing a part of our town that needs it,” he said on an online site. When reached for comment Francioli said, “This gong to hurt seniors living near the market. People won’t have a supermarket to go to in the neighborhood.” Pine Plaza needs an anchor store to prosper,” he added. “With Farmtastic gone I worry about the future of the plaza.” Pine Plaza, built in the 1990s has always been considered an under-achiever in the township’s economy. “Other stores here are closed up now,” LaRacca said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t know what the landlord is going to put in here. He wants me to stay.” The landlord, Pine Plaza Associates, did not immediately return phones calls for a response. Store personnel remained on duty and customer-focused, though no one wanted to talk to the Hanover Eagle. “Next week I’ll be on unemployment.” said a woman store worker who declined to give her name. “It’s sad.” As for LaRacca, “I’ll be going back to the Lake Hiawatha store,” he said. “I’m young; I hope to get another chance.” The son was right. A store about half the size selling only what really moves would have been great. The store really wasn't that much smaller than Stop & Shop. They seemed to want to cover everything and that puts them at a major disadvantage against the big boys. Think Trader Joes. He only sells what he can make a profit on. He doesn't try to be the one store you can buy everything. I'm sorry that someone's business failed, but the few times I went there because it was convenient from work, I paid significantly more than I would at Shop Rite or Stop and Shop, the selection was much worse, and I also got home to find out the items were expired FOUR TIMES. Once was when they first opened, so they brought already expired food into their store for sale. After the third time, I tried to be much more careful with checking the dates. After the fourth time, I just would not go back. Things slip through the cracks, but when it happens at one particular place over and over, that place has a problem. Log In BE YOURSELF.

mother ELIZABETH, NJ — Carlos Vasquez, 38, of Elizabeth, has a hopeful future, thanks to his mother. On Wednesday, March 1, he had a successful kidney transplant surgery performed at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston. His donor was his mother, Daisy Vasquez, 59, of Elizabeth. From childhood, Carlos had a great relationship with his mother. Since his father worked as a truck driver and was not around much, Carlos’s early childhood memories focused on being with his mother. “Carlos is my third child,” Daisy said. “He’s been a good kid. Never got into trouble. He likes being home.” Life was normal for Carlos. He worked consistently. He was always active, going to the gym, going out with friends, watching movies with his girlfriend, Amy Fernandez, and having fun. Then it all started with headaches, which grew more intense and more frequent. Carlos never got an annual check-up. Since he always went to the gym, he thought he was healthy. Headaches worsened and the only thing that helped was hot showers. “Every two hours I’d hop in the shower to bring down the pressure,” he expressed. “This isn’t normal.” When Carlos began spitting up blood clots, he went to Urgent Care, where he saw many doctors and ear, nose and throat specialists. After having a computerized tomography or CAT scan of his sinuses, Carlos learned they were all blocked up, which caused the pressure. He had been taking 1,000 milligrams of Advil and it just stopped working. “I was damaging my kidneys, taking Advil,” he said. Surgery helped relieve the head pressure and the doctors were able to unclog the sinus area a little bit, but the area was so infected, they had to go back to the drawing board to find out why there was so much infection. His legs also began to feel heavy and swollen. It turned out, Carlos was in renal failure. He had to go to the emergency room. “The world turned upside down,” Daisy said. “When he started getting headaches, I thought it was allergies; a simple thing that was gonna be fixed.” It was not simple. Carlos had a rare autoimmune condition called Wegener’s vasculitis, also known as granulomatosis with polyangiitis. This is an uncommon disorder that causes inflammation of the blood vessels in your nose, sinuses, throat, lungs and kidneys. The condition attacked his kidneys. “I never heard the word ‘vasculitis’ before,” Daisy said. “It turned out to be very serious and deadly. It set back Carlos — a lot.” Carlos was on dialysis at least four or five times a week. For a while, he did OK without dialysis, but when things took a turn for the worse again, Carlos had a choice — a kidney implant or go back on dialysis. “Knowing my dad, he’d give me both of his kidneys,” Carlos said. Unfortunately, his father is a diabetic and UNOS, the organization responsible for organ donation in the United States, will not allow people with diabetes to donate. “My mom hopped in the driver’s seat,” he said. “She cares about me a lot. She’s always there for me.” Daisy thought she was too old to donate a kidney to her son, but she was told it didn’t play a factor. She would go through a series of tests to see if she was healthy enough to live without one kidney. “We’ll put it in God’s hands,” she said. Last year, the day before Thanksgiving, Daisy received the call that she would be able to be a donor for her son and they set a date for the surgery. While Daisy is an active person and in good health, she also decided to lose weight prior to the surgery. She lost 20 pounds. After the transplant, she continues to take care of herself. “I feel fantastic,” she said. “I am back to doing all the normal things I used to do. Some days, I forget I donated a kidney. Doctors told me I’m doing very well. I have to take care of my kidney and I want it to last. I drink lots of water. Kidneys love water.” Daisy’s goal is to stay in good health. “I want to tell as many people as I can about organ donation — that it’s possible. One person can enhance the life of others.” As for Carlos, his mother said, “It hasn’t all been easy. It’s a lot better than before. He’s in a better place. Living on dialysis is not easy. We don’t want to sugar coat it.” But the future looks hopeful. “He’s a very happy guy,” Daisy said. “He’s just trying to regain his health. It’s a work in progress.” Carlos is equally as hopeful as his mother. “It’s a major surgery. Recovery is tough. It feels like you got hit by a train,” he expressed. “You can live a normal life. Right now, I’m going through a rough patch. I’m banking on the future. I’ve got a supportive family and girlfriend.” Photo Courtesy of NJ Sharing Network Elizabeth man has successful kidney transplant thanks to his mother added by Maryanne Christiano-Mistretta on November 26, 2023View all posts by Maryanne Christiano-Mistretta → Elizabeth man has successful kidney transplant thanks to his mother added by Maryanne Christiano-Mistretta on November 26, 2023View all posts by Maryanne Christiano-Mistretta →'}]"

Hunterdon Central High School, North Hunterdon High School and Voorhees High School each had teams competing this year. The teams prepare for competition with the help and guidance of both teacher coaches and local attorneys who volunteer their time to coach. The High School Mock Trial Competition provides a fictitious case in which the students play the parts of both attorneys and witnesses. The cases differ from year to year. This year’s case was a wrongful death civil case. In the opening round each team engaged in two trials. The initial rounds were set up so that each school would “play” every other school. Following the “very competitive” opening round, the teams with the two best records, Hunterdon Central High School and Voorhees High School, advanced to the final’s competition. On Feb. 1, the finals of the Hunterdon County Mock Trial took place at the Historic Courthouse in Flemington. Judge Peter Tober, P.J.Cr. and Judge John J. Burke, III, J.S.C. presided over the final competition. In a “very close match,” Hunterdon Central High School defeated Voorhees High School, and advanced to the regional level of the New Jersey State Mock Trial Competition. Laura Shaban from Hunterdon Central was named as best overall attorney and Sophia Charleston from Voorhees was named as best overall witness. The 2022-2023 Vincent J.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:14 am The original parts of this 91 Woodland Road home in Madison were here at the time of the American Revolution. MADISON - The planned destruction of a Revolutionary War era home has left residents frustrated and the recent homeowners dumbfounded. Local builder Stephen McCann of Historic Homes by McCann, LLC, intends to bulldoze the circa 1770 Joseph Wingate House at 91 Woodland Rd. in the coming weeks to make way for a new house. The original part of the home was here at the time of the American Revolution as George Washington and his Continental Army spent two winters in this area, when many officers billeted in local homes. Town Historian Scott Spelker has called attention to the demolition plan in a video and social media posts on local Facebook groups in the past week. Nearly 800 residents and former residents have since signed a Change.org petition to oppose the plan, and many more have registered their disapproval on Facebook. Spelker says parts of the Continental Army may have marched by the Wingate House en route to the United States’ decisive victory at the Battle of Yorktown in Virginia in 1781. The Wingates were here amid the army’s winter encampments of 1776-1777 and 1779-1780, and at one point buried their valuables in the Great Swamp on a report that the British were coming, according to Spelker. While both the borough and Morris County have recognized the historical significance of the Wingate House, the structure is listed on neither the state nor national Register of Historic Places, meaning there is nothing to stop a builder from tearing it down. McCann says he originally intended to restore the home to be lived in by members of his family, but now says the restoration costs are beyond his budget. Spelker, echoing comments made by hundreds of residents on social media, said the loss of the home would make Madison “a little less special.” “There aren’t many homes that have been around since the Revolutionary War,” he said, noting the significance of this area during the revolution. “This house was there at the very inception of the country. It’s not like it’s a 1770s house in New Hampshire in the middle of nowhere.” ‘Absolutely Gutting’ Former resident Christina Shelby, who grew up in the house and executed the sale on behalf of her family in April, said the family never would have sold the home without the many assurances it received from the buyers that they would preserve and restore it. She oversaw the sale as she has been granted power of attorney over her mother, Linda, who is suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and would be “crushed” to learn of the news, she said. “It’s just absolutely gutting to think that you’ve appropriately stewarded a piece of history and then you find out that the people you trusted are going to destroy it,” Shelby said in a phone interview. The Shelbys were the eighth family to live in the Wingate House since the American Revolution, a fact the family never lost sight of during their 40-plus years in the home. Christina, born in 1981, grew up there with her sisters and parents. She described the 250-year-old home’s low ceilings, crooked floors and enormous fireplace that was once used to heat the entire house. “We knew when we were kids that our house was different from everybody else’s,” Shelby said. “My mom was so taken with the history of the place. She was a history buff and a lover of Revolutionary War era history herself, and took every opportunity to remind us how special the place was. She said we were a part of the story of this home that went all the way back to the founding of the nation.” She said she feels misled by McCann and by the family members for whom the developer was purchasing the property. She shared emails she exchanged with members of McCann’s family. “We had all these conversations about how terrible it is that these historic homes are constantly purchased and torn down and how important it is to try to be a part of saving that,” Shelby said of her communications with one family member. “He approached us with that promise and it was a part of every conversation that we had. It’s just astounding that this would then be the outcome. I don’t know if this was just dishonesty from the very beginning or if something changed.” McCann told this newspaper he initially intended to restore the historic home to be lived in by members of his family, but after purchasing it in April he found it would be too costly to repair. He says he “underestimated the amount of work required,” partly as his due diligence was done before the home had been emptied out. He and a construction manager only realized the extent of the costs during a pre-renovation meeting after the close of sale, he said. “There was no malintent and discussions with the prior owner were genuinely sincere despite the current backlash and accusations being made. I have been a resident of Madison for over 35 years and built and renovated many nice homes, several of which possess a very historic tone,” while passing on redeveloping many historic homes “for exactly this reason,” he said. Asked if his family members still intend to move into a future home on the property, or if he would consider selling the existing house to somebody willing to restore it, McCann said the answer to both questions is as yet undecided. The Shelby family had a certified inspector ensure the home was salvageable and could be restored prior to the sale, and Shelby said no issues were raised at any point during or after a walk-through she did with McCann and his family members. The family learned of the demolition plan last week through Spelker’s Facebook posts. They find McCann’s account to be difficult to believe to the point of feeling that they were lied to. Spelker also believes the home can and should be saved. Residents Hope For Different Outcome Spelker, who is a real estate agent who has overseen the sale of several other 18th century houses in town, takes issue with McCann’s story about the home being too far gone. If that is the case, he said, McCann should have realized it before agreeing to the sale, particularly as the former homeowner was dedicated to seeing it preserved. “And nobody in their right mind would pay $710,000 for that house unless you were buying it for the lot,” Spelker added. McCann has sought to downplay the historical significance of the home by noting that it may have been built as late as 1780, which was when it was first listed in Morris County tax records, not the mid-1770s. The Morris County Cultural Resources Inventory, however, lists the construction of the home as occurring between 1750 and 1780, and estimating the construction year as circa 1770, or pre-revolutionary. The record is not clear either way. McCann also disputes Spelker’s telling of the Yorktown march, saying Washington’s army likely marched east from Chatham into Springfield, rather than west into Madison en route to the battle. A map and description of Washington’s route provided by the state Department of Transportation supports McCann’s point that the army marched east and did not pass the house on the way to Yorktown. Spelker cites contemporary journal sources from the time to support his point, but either way says a debate over the historical record of which direction Washington marched in misses the point. “This isn’t a matter of whether Washington’s troops went by it. It’s a 1770 house. It’s not who went by it, it’s the fact that it’s a very old house and they’re not making any more of them,” Spelker said. The historian said the house could be renovated and restored like many other historic homes in town, and that few builders in the area could do a better job at restoring the home than McCann. He said he hopes McCann will reconsider, or will agree to a meeting in a public forum so he and his family members can hear from the residents upset by the plan. “I’m hopeful that Steve and his family are the ones that will do it,” Spelker wrote in an comment on the Change.org petition. “They could truly cement their place in Madison history as the family that restored one of Madison’s historic gems.” McCann is to meet with representatives of the Historic Preservation Commision (HPC) for an informal meeting, but it remains his right to demolish the Wingate House. Commission Chair Jill Rhodes said she does not believe the HPC could compel McCann to save the house as it is not in a historic district. The Shelby'}]"

Youth Soccer League Board. â\x80\x9dWe have coaches who are coaching teams not because their kid is playing on the team but because they coached in the past and have been brought back because parents are not stepping up to coach their own kids,â\x80\x9d said Gollinger, whose children have aged out of the program. What is causing the dip in enrollment could be a combination of things, he said. â\x80\x9dIn terms of COVID, we certainly had less players that first fall, and maybe once people stop doing something, it is harder to get them back into it. Maybe they are doing different things.â\x80\x9d Shannon Greiner has been involved in Girl Scouts in Vernon for more than a decade. She started a troop when her oldest daughter was in kindergarten and became a leader when her other daughter, now in seventh grade, joined. â\x80\x9dIn that time, I became what is known as a service unit manager, meaning I am responsible for all 160 Girl Scouts in Vernon,â\x80\x9d she said. â\x80\x9cEvery year, it is a struggle to get new volunteers. I am lucky to have a great group of women who help me, and we pick one another up if someone drops the ball. â\x80\x9dBut with the younger parents, I see a lack of willingness to volunteer. My leaders and I have been doing this for so long that we can hand you a package and probably the supplies with everything you need to get a new troop up and running. It has gotten so bad this year that Girls Scouts of Northern New Jersey is running a pilot program for brand-new Daisy Troops. They are giving away supply boxes every month to run your meetings for you.â\x80\x9d Eileen Verboys, a Girl Scout leader in Warwick, N.Y., agrees that finding volunteers is always a challenge. In fact, her husband and daughter coached a K-2 lacrosse team a couple of years ago even though their family had nobody playing on the team, she said. There simply werenâ\x80\x99t any parents of the players who wanted to or knew how to coach lacrosse. â\x80\x9dI started in Girl Scouts here in Warwick about 12 years ago and the numbers seemed to have dipped a bit, but over the past two years, they are rebounding, and things are going well,â\x80\x9d she said. â\x80\x9dIt is always a struggle to find parent leaders. But for some parents, I must say it seems as though they use it as a babysitting service.â\x80\x9d In Pennsylvaniaâ\x80\x99s Eastern Pike County Soccer League, the story is different. James Scott says volunteer and player enrollments are sky high. He is in his fifth year with the recreational soccer league that he originally joined because his niece was playing. â\x80\x9dIn Eastern Pike, we take players from mostly the areas surrounding Milford, Matamoras and Port Jervis. We have an abundance of volunteers and players. I would say our volunteers put in hundreds, if not thousands, of hours. Nothing would get done without them.â\x80\x9d Worry about concussions Chris Sullivan, who coaches 8-U tackle football in Monroe, N.Y., said the numbers in the youth football league are way down during the past decade or so. It may have something to do with concerns about concussions. â\x80\x9dFor example, prior to that movie about NFL players and concussions several years back, our division with kids ages 5, 6 and 7 had 60 kids. This year - we donâ\x80\x99t have 5-years-olds anymore - our division with kids ages 6, 7 and 8 has a total of 19 kids on a good day,â\x80\x9d he said. â\x80\x9dI know baseball numbers are down and even lacrosse numbers in Monroe are down over the past three years because the youth lacrosse league we built has not been kept alive by the younger parents behind us.â\x80\x9d Sullivan noted that the quality of coaching also has fallen because it is easier to find parents who are quality coaches when there are 60 players compared with 19. Conversely, the flag football league that Sullivan started several years ago now boasts close to 300 participants. He has heard parents say they will wait until their children are well into their high school years before they allow them to play tackle football. Michael Luongo of Woodbury, N.Y., tells a similar story. He started coaching youth sports when his children were younger and continues to coach middle school students in basketball and football although his children have aged out. â\x80\x9dI coach basketball with the Gym Rats over in Chester because they cannot find parents to coach,â\x80\x9d he said. â\x80\x9cI love coaching and I do my best to encourage kids and parents alike to come on out. â\x80\x9dThe numbers in both basketball and in Monroe Woodbury, where I am back to coaching youth football, are way down from where they were when I was coaching my kids. I would say we have one-third fewer players coming out for football. And again, many of the coaches at the youth level do not have kids on a team.â\x80\x9d Video game competition Kelly Cronin has been involved in Warwick (N.Y.) Youth Lacrosse since her daughter started playing at the age of 3. She has found some of the same challenges seen in other towns. â\x80\x9dOur girls league is thriving, but it will be interesting to see what happens next year as a lot of the coaches age out with their kids,â\x80\x9d she said. â\x80\x9cLuckily, the high school lacrosse coach has a young daughter who will be playing in our K-2 division so he will be a coach and probably keep things going, but I think there are many parents who would rather see the program fall apart than give any of their time. â\x80\x9dI think some coaches are driven away from youth sports because other parents are content letting their kids stay on video games and electronics.â\x80\x9d The struggle is real with the Monroe-Woodbury (N.Y.) Recreational Basketball League, according to one source who asked to remain anonymous. â\x80\x9dSince our league is so large, typically 600 players, we do have issues finding enough volunteers,â\x80\x9d said the source, who has been involved in the youth league for several years. â\x80\x9cWe have been lucky to be able to run each season. â\x80\x9dIn the past few years, we have had dads without players coach and also some young men whoâ\x80\x99d played in the league prior offer to coach a team. I donâ\x80\x99t think COVID has played much of a role in lack of coaches. We didnâ\x80\x99t play when schools were closed. In general, I would say we struggle and have to pull teeth to get all of our teams covered.â\x80\x9d Strong parental support In Vernon, David Eustice is one of the many volunteers involved with the Vernon Instrumental Parent Group, which supports the Vernon Township High School Marching Band by building sets and helping out during competitions. Eustace, whose daughter, a senior, plays saxophone, said the number of band participants and parent volunteers has remained relatively stable since COVID. â\x80\x9dAs parent volunteers, a group of us get together a couple nights a week during the fall competition season and put together props to meet whatever the theme is,â\x80\x9d he said. â\x80\x9dThe band goes to most of the football games and participates in six or seven competitions in the fall. In my experience, which is over three years now, the parental support for the band has always been strong.â\x80\x9d'}]"

Click the appropriate button to the right Subscribe News Business Our Town Opinion Health Entertainment Sports Real Estate Advertise About Town Staff Directory More It is a pleasure to be here. It sounds like a cliché, but I truly mean it. It’s common to hear how wonderful the town of Hammonton is…mostly from the locals, but they’re right, it is wonderful. As the newly appointed publisher, I feel immensely grateful for the incredible support, camaraderie and opportunities that this vibrant community has offered me. Today, I want to celebrate the greatness of this community and share the profound happiness I’ve experienced in joining its ranks. I’m looking at being a part of this community from a different perspective. As a south Jerseyian for the past 25 years I’ve visited Hammonton for dining, shopping, festivals, etc. The folks I’ve met in the last six days since becoming publisher of The Hammonton Gazette have been terrific and welcoming. I’ve always known they were terrific and welcoming, but now I’m looking at it from being a part of the community. But after six days, how can I claim I’m part of the community? That’s my point, you all are so welcoming and I appreciate it. It’s heartwarming to discover a thriving community that welcomes newcomers with open arms. Speaking of greatness, the staff here at The Gazette have been unbelievable. Not only have they been welcoming, they’ve dealt with dramatic change professionally and with a “can-do” attitude. Our recently-promoted editor, Mohammed Fuad just put out his first newspaper in his new role after being in it for less than a week. Dan Russoman is our sports editor and performed duties above and beyond that of a sports editor last week. Our business office manager and copy editor, Jaime Wuillermin stepped up and performed new duties she’d never been trained on. And last, but certainly not least is the superb work of MarySusan Hoffman. MarySusan was one of many travelers on the east coast who had a flight delayed several days on her way home from Florida. Without her help remotely, I’m not sure you would have been reading a paper last week. This is a group of talented, dedicated and loyal folks and I’m extremely proud to be a part of the team. The paper you’ve learned to love and trust over the years did not happen overnight. For 26 years, Gabe Donio launched and nurtured this great community newspaper. He and his wife, Gina Rullo Donio, worked tirelessly to serve the community with a product that helps to bond this great town. My hat’s off to them and I wish them all the best in the future. As a seasoned veteran of the newspaper and media industry, I’ve been fortunate to connect with talented staffs, explore exciting businesses and venture into new markets. Prior to The Press of Atlantic City being sold in 2013, I served as the publisher there for 12 years. I began my media adventure in college, and managed my career through the many changes since the late 80’s. My newspaper journey has been rewarding, exciting, fun and full of change. Some of which I hope to bring to The Gazette. As far as change goes, we want to hear from our readers, advertisers and business partners. We’d like to hear the good, bad and ugly. What do you like? What would you like to see improved? What changes can we help foster throughout the community? After all, a great newspaper should be the heart and soul of the neighbors it serves. Send your suggestions and thoughts to me at kdawn@hammontongazette.com. In this age of digitalization and instant gratification, it’s easy to overlook the importance of good, local journalism. We plan to bring you unbiased, fair and accurate information for which our constituents can be proud. We plan to deliver our core news product to our passionate readers, but also diversify our delivery methods to expand our audiences and bring the best possible results to our advertisers. Through all this you’ll see change. Some of which you’ll like and some you may not. I am filled with gratitude and excitement for the journey ahead, knowing that I am surrounded by such a remarkable community of passionate individuals.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:14 am The Madison Public Schools 2023 referendum page states that “Madison is moving forward.” MADISON - Borough voters will head to the polls from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. today, Tuesday, Dec. 12, to decide on a three-question, $79.4 million bond referendum to enhance Madison's five public school buildings. Voters will use the same polling locations they used in the general election on Tuesday, Nov. 7. Polling places by district are listed at the bottom of this story. The three ballot questions are successive, meaning Question 1 must pass in order for Question 2 to pass, and both Questions 1 and 2 must pass in order for Question 3 to pass. The district is eligible for as much as $21.9 million in state debt service aid if voters approve the referendum projects today. All projects in Questions 1 and 2 and most of the projects in Question 3 are eligible for state aid. The first of the three ballot questions to be considered today will total about $49 million. This base question, Question 1, would provide heating and ventilation upgrades district-wide, upgrade bathrooms and some classroom spaces, install new, locking interior doors, new fire alarm and public address systems, remove asbestos from ceilings and floors, provide major security upgrades; a new roof at Madison High School; new boilers at the high school and Central Avenue School; and improve accessibility at Kings Road School, the junior school and the high school. Question 2, which is contingent on Question 1 passing, would provide air conditioning in all classrooms and common areas across the five schools, and replace windows at Central Avenue School at a total cost of about $12 million. Question 3, contingent on the first two questions passing, would create a new gymnasium, bathrooms, two new classrooms and upgrade the field and playground – all at Central Avenue School,; expand and renovate the Kings Road School multi-purpose room; renovate the Madison High School gym, turf field and track; fix drainage issues at the Madison Junior School grass field; and repair walls and restore parking lots, sidewalks and concrete stairs at all five schools. The Question 3 projects would total about $18 million. If Question 1 passes, the average homeowner, based on an average assessed home value of $690,000, will pay an extra $40 per month on school taxes. If all three questions pass, residents would pay an extra $69 per month, or a total of $828 more per year. Where To Vote Residents will vote on the referendum at the same locations they voted in person on Tuesday, Nov. 7. Polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. at the following locations: Districts 3, 7, 11 and 12 – Grace Episcopal Church Parish Hall, 4 Madison Ave.; Districts 1, 4, 5, 9 and 13 – Hartley Dodge Memorial courtroom, 50 Kings Road. Districts 8 and 10 – Madison Area YMCA Teen Center, 111 Kings Road; and Districts 1, 4 and 9 – Presbyterian Church of Madison, 19 Green Ave. Districts 2, 6 and 14 – Rexford S. Tucker Apartments community room, 15 Chateau Thierry Ave. For more information, visit www.madisonpublicschools/vote.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:14 am HANOVER TWP. - The Whippany Park High School wrestling team was 3-16 last year and hope to improve on that under coach Devon Engelberger, who will be assisted by two-time state champion Andrew Flanagan, Greg Skiff and Vince Coiro. The team’s two best wrestlers are Michael Fahmie and Jon Ehrhardt, both of whom have region experience and should contend for county and region medals Fahmie, Ehrhardt, Devin Ferrante are all seniors with a lot of varsity experience. Fahmie and Ehrhardt are physical and competitive three-sport athletes while Ferrante focuses on just wrestling. “They have made jumps over the years,” Engleberger said. “Devin Ferrante has put in a lot of time over the past year. He is a club wrestler that wrestled many competitive tournaments.” Amar Munkh moved from Mongolia just a few years ago and has taken to the sport. He is not a region-caliber wrestler right now, but he has improved a great deal with strong work ethic, according to Engleberger. The team figures to be strong in the middle weights and will possess a deeper lineup. The Wildcats will compete in District 11 against the likes of Belvidere, Columbia, East Orange, Hackettstown, Newark Academy, Pope John, and West Morris. Projected Starting Lineup 106- Aiden Morris 113- Shawn Haynes 120- Adam Verchinski 126- Devin Ferrante, Sal Palmisano 132- Ferrante/Palmisano, Robert Ehrhardt 138- Alex Birecki, Marco Ippolito, Karri Barreche 144- Amar Munkh-Orgil 150- Cole Montano, Josh Smith 157- Jacob Birecki, Gabe Saliani 165- Michael Fahmie 175- Jon Ehrhardt, Jusuf Daraku 190- Ruben Palacios, Adyen Singh 215- Laz Lima, Leo Lima, Jendry Ventura 285- Christian Espinoza, Colin Brock pnardone@newjerseyhills.com Log In Be Yourself.

""Machines cannot fully replace"" humans in the courtroom, Roberts wrote in his year-end report, citing the human nuance required when judges measure the sincerity of a defendant\'s remorse. ""Much can turn on a shaking hand, a quivering voice, a change of inflection, a bead of sweat, a moment\'s hesitation, a fleeting break in eye contact.""

""Those changes will involve not only how judges go about doing their job, but also how they understand the role that AI plays in the cases that come before them."" Courts are not alone in wrestling with how to reliably embrace artificial intelligence. And some of the questions created by the technology are likely bound for Supreme Court review. The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft this month, for instance, asserting that the companies violated copyright law by using the newspaper\'s content to train its artificial intelligence chatbots. It\'s a case that could reach the high court. Federal courts, meanwhile, have been dealing with the misuse of AI by attorneys. Just last week former President Donald Trump\'s one-time lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen acknowledged relying on AI to generate references to past legal opinions that, in turned out, were fabricated. Mixing whimsy with wariness, Roberts noted that the Supreme Court didn\'t have a copy machine until Chief Justice Warren Burger ordered one in 1969. In 1976, Roberts wrote, Justice Lewis Powell ""deployed a rented Wang computer in his chambers."" Several other justices ""observed the satisfactory performance of this newfangled \'word processing machine\'"" and ordered one for themselves. Even today, much of the Supreme Court\'s work is conducted on paper. Roberts said several committees of the Judicial Conference, the entity that sets internal policies for the federal court system, are reviewing the courts\' use of AI. ""As 2023 draws to a close with breathless predictions about the future of Artificial Intelligence, some may wonder whether judges are about to become obsolete,"" Roberts wrote. ""I am sure we are not − but equally confident that technological changes will continue to transform our work."" Roberts\' annual reports often steer clear of major controversies facing the Supreme Court in the prior year. In his latest installment, the chief made no reference to the ethics matters that have swirled around the justices for months. In November, the Supreme Court adopted a code of conduct for the first time in its history, a response to a series of stories this year detailing lavish travel that Justice Clarence Thomas accepted from GOP donor Harlan Crow, as well as other revelations.'}]"

Robinson of Bernardsville has been named editor of the Bernardsville News. She succeeds Charles T. Zavalick, who retired after serving as editor for 34 years. “We are really going to miss Charlie, who did just an amazing job for us over the years. He will be sorely missed and we wish him well in his retirement,” said Executive Editor Elizabeth Parker. “But if anyone can fill his shoes, it is Pat, who will be the first woman editor of The Bernardsville News in its 126-year history. She is a true professional.” This is Robinson’s second stint at the newspaper, having first served as a staff writer under Zavalick in the days following Sept. 11, 2001. After that, she was promoted to editor of The Randolph Reporter, and later the Chatham Courier and Florham Park Eagle and, recently, editor of the Mount Olive Chronicle and Observer-Tribune, where she is succeeded by Brett Friedensohn. Robinson returned to journalism after working in other communications areas, including technical writing and serving as a public relations manager for AT&T’s international consumer group. While at New Jersey Hills Media Group, she has won awards from the National Newspaper Association and New Jersey Press Association, the most recent being for Stormwater Matters, a nine-part series that focused on drinking water quality to stormwater management and everything in between, won first place in the coveted Lloyd P. Burns Memorial Award for Public Service. Robinson, Alex Parker-Magyar and Mike Condon spearheaded the local effort which also included work by New Jersey Spotlight News, TapInto Newark and Public Square Amplified as part of a collaborative Solutions Journalism news project. She has a bachelor of arts degree in English from Caldwell College, a master’s degree in English and American Literature from Seton Hall University, and a master’s degree in international affairs from Drew University. She is the author of two non-fiction books about New Jersey for Plexus Publishing out of Medford, Wonderwalks: “The Trails of New Jersey Audubon,” and “The New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail: A Top to Bottom Tour.” P.C.
