With a broadcast career spanning nearly 50 years, Mike Nelson has become a member of the family for generations of Coloradans.

According to Denver 7, Mike will roll up all his weather maps by the end of 2024, with his last weathercast coming on December 12. Mike was behind the very first weather computers in the 1980s and would go around to television stations and show them how they operated. One of those stops was at NBC to show Al Roker the ropes. Having started his career in 1976, Mike and his wife, Cindy, moved to Colorado in 1991, when he became chief meteorologist for KUSA Channel 9. In 2004, he took on the same position for KMGH Denver 7.
