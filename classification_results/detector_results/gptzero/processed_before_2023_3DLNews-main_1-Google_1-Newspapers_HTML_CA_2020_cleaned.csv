Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 2:07 am Palo Alto law enforcement officials are seeking information about a severely injured bulldog-pitbull mix left anonymously at a local shelter over the weekend. Employees of Pets In Need discovered the dog, now named Baby, Saturday (Jan. 25) morning in a crate left outside the organization’s East Bayshore Road facility, which serves partner cities Los Altos and Los Altos Hills. They estimate he is approximately a year old. Due to the extensive bite marks around Baby’s neck and head, it’s possible he was used in a dog-fighting ring as a “bait dog” for competitive fighting dogs to attack, said Al Mollica, Pets In Need's executive director. “Obviously, they were trying to teach the (other) dog to go with the kill moves,” Mollica said. It’s also possible Baby was part of a dog fight that didn’t involve human provocation, said Cody Macartney, lead animal control officer with the city of Palo Alto. “It’s rare that we have an animal in this condition that’s left at our door…this is probably the most severe case I’ve seen of an animal dumped at the shelter,” said Macartney, who worked at the shelter from 2002 up until about a year ago, when Pets In Need took over operations. Shelter staff rushed Baby to an emergency veterinary clinic, where he received numerous stitches, according to a PIN press release. He experienced considerable swelling and is currently recuperating with instruments in both his arms to drain excessive fluid. “Had Baby not received treatment when he did, he would have died,” according to the release. Although dog fighting is not considered common in the Bay Area, Mollica believes Baby may have belonged to someone who lived locally, which could improve the chances his abusers are caught. “This little guy is from the area, I’m sure,” he said. “I can’t imagine someone would drive many, many miles to drop off a dog.” The penalty for dog fighting ranges from a misdemeanor to a felony depending on the severity of the case, Macartney said. Animal abandonment and improper care can lead to a fine or a misdemeanor charge, and it’s up to a judge’s discretion. There are signs on the Bayshore property warning animal dumping is illegal. Baby will be available for adoption in a few weeks, when he has healed, Mollica said. He added that the dog’s violent past – whatever it may have entailed – will not preclude him from becoming a suitable pet; the PIN press release described Baby “as affectionate and kind.” Report tips about Baby’s origins to Palo Alto Animal Control at 838-2807.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:44 am A beast on the football field as well as the wrestling mat, it was easy to recognize Blake Ritchie, since he was probably tackling someone and dominating anyone unlucky enough to stand in his way. Known for his athletic accomplishments and positive nature growing up, and more recently as a hard-working father, that spirit was taken away over the weekend when Ritchie fell overboard while fishing on the Delta and didn’t resurface until local law enforcement found his body in the morning hours on Aug. 31 while conducting a search along with his family. Ritchie had gone fishing with friends Aug. 29 and fell out of the boat at one point. His father, as well as one of Ritchie’s former wrestling coaches, Brian Robinson, arrived at the spot where Ritchie’s body was pulled out of the water after authorities found his body Aug. 31. Ritchie had gone from an award-winning athlete before he graduated from Liberty Ranch High School to becoming a new dad earlier this year; those who knew him were coming to grips with the news Monday. “He doesn’t say a whole lot. He’s real humble. He looked like a larger-than-life figure but he was the nicest, most innocent dude you’d meet. I would have issues, and he’d be like, ‘Coach, calm down.’” Johnson said in a phone interview Sept. 1. “He just had a baby, and was working. He enjoyed working, enjoyed his family; he was doing everything he was supposed to be doing. He loved being in Wilton, fishing.” In Bryan Golder’s eyes, the former football player was one-of-a-kind on and off the field. “I remember he’d come to practice with a cowboy hat and boots. He was his own man. He wasn’t a follower. He definitely set out to conquer. He wasn’t half-hearted. For me, I felt blessed to be a part of his life,” Golder said Aug. 31. Golder, along with head coach Anthony Linebaugh, coached Ritchie at Liberty Ranch. “A lot of kids would say, ‘Coach, I’m blessed to have you’, but I was blessed to have him in my life.” Ritchie made his presence known both on the field and on the mat; he was co-captain of the Hawks in his senior year 2017, along with his brother Thomas Thornburg and he went on to lead the team with 96 total tackles and four sacks that year, as well as landing fifth among Sierra Valley Conference leaders in tackles. In 2015, he was one of only three sophomores, including his brother, to play for the varsity Hawks during their 5-0 SVC championship season and subsequent run for a Sac-Joaquin Section title, in which they finished second. “I remember, at Los Banos in the Section semifinals, he came over and gave me a big ‘ol hug and started crying, and he was like, ‘Coach, we’re going to the Section title game. We’re the first team to go to the Section game. I wouldn’t trade this for the world,’” Golder said of the Hawks’ first-ever SJS Championship game for football. “That was a beautiful moment.” Ritchie also made school history in wrestling after he became the first Hawk to win the D IV Championship his senior year. That win, as well as his eighth-place finish at Masters, came after he was forced to sit out his junior year after injuring his shoulder during football. Despite his athletic accomplishments during his later years in school, it is his first year on the wrestling team that brings a distinct memory to Johnson’s thoughts. “He was a little guy. I remember when he was just a little guy with braces. Every time I think about him, that’s who I see,” Johnson said. Besides turning heads in football and wrestling, Ritchie also was a part of an elite group in his freshman year, having competed as a tri-sport athlete in track in addition to football and wrestling. Linebaugh wasn’t immediately available for comment, but Golder noted one memory that stuck with him that took place during Ritchie’s senior year, in which the Hawks went 3-7. “His senior year, he came to me and said, ‘This is a horrible season! But I tell you what, we’d better not lose to Galt,’” Golder said with a laugh. Liberty Ranch went on to beat the Warriors 40-19 that year. “He was just one of those guys; if I could have 11 Blake Ritchies on the field, we’d go to the Sections every year,” Golder added. “We wouldn’t be the fastest, but we’d be the toughest. There have been plenty of gems that have come through Liberty Ranch High School football, but Blake was a diamond.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular articles.

tree near the Victorville City Library more than a week before a second, similar case near City Hall in Palmdale. Malcolm Harsch, 38, was found near a homeless encampment near Zenda and Seventh streets after deputies responded around 7 a.m. May 31 to a report of a man who had hung himself, San Bernardino County Sheriff\'s Department spokesperson Jodi Miller said. Zenda Street runs east-west through a residential neighborhood in a section of Victorville just south of Old Town. Miller said a death investigation was ongoing, and that the cause and manner of death were pending. Miller said Harsch\'s body was found about a mile away from the library, which is accessible from Zenda Street. But Harsch\'s family is asking for more answers amid heightened tension and scrutiny of police departments after the killing of George Floyd, as well as the death of another Black man in Palmdale earlier this week. Robert Fuller\'s body was also found hanging from a tree early Wednesday morning near City Hall. A passerby reported seeing Fuller\'s body around 3 a.m. Wednesday. Emergency personnel responded and found that he appeared to have died by suicide, Los Angeles County Sheriff\'s officials said. Palmdale is about 60 miles northeast of Los Angeles. Victorville is about 50 miles east of Palmdale. Fuller\'s death has generated intense scrutiny, especially after nationwide protests rebuking the police killing of Floyd. On Saturday, hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Palmdale, a city of 150,000, marching from the park where Fuller\'s body was found to the sheriff\'s station. Many carried signs that said ""Justice for Robert Fuller."" More than 100,000 people signed an online petition demanding a full investigation into Fuller\'s death. Community members confronted city officials at a contentious news briefing Friday, asking why they were quick to label his death a suicide and demanding an independent autopsy. ""I have doubts about what happened,"" Marisela Barajas, who went to the press conference and joined a crowd gathered at the tree where Fuller\'s body was found, told the Los Angeles Times. ""All alone, in front of the City Hall – it\'s more like a statement,"" she said. ""Even if it was a suicide, that in itself is kind of a statement."" Lt. Kelly Yagerlener of the L.A. County medical examiner-coroner\'s office said a decision on the cause of death is deferred pending an investigation. A full autopsy is planned. Palmdale residents demanded surveillance video around the time and place where Fuller\'s body was found. The city said there were no outdoor cameras, and video recorders on a nearby traffic signal could not have captured what happened. L.A. Sheriff\'s Capt. Ron Shaffer said homicide detectives were investigating the circumstances leading to Fuller\'s death to determine if foul play was involved. He urged members of the public to contact detectives if they have relevant information, particularly about where Fuller had been and who he had been with in recent weeks. Palmdale officials wrote in a statement that investigators have been in contact with Fuller\'s family. KPCC-FM reported that at Saturday\'s march, Fuller\'s sister, Diamond Alexander, insisted her brother was not suicidal. ""Robert was a good little brother to us and it\'s like everything they have been telling us has not been right … and we just want to know the truth,"" she said. Harsch\'s family members, like Fuller\'s, said they have difficulty believing he killed himself. They said he had recently spoken with his children “and other family members about seeing them soon.” “He didn\'t seem to be depressed to anyone who truly knew him. Everyone who knew our brother was shocked to hear that he allegedly hung himself and don\'t believe it to be true as well as the people who were there when his body was discovered,” the family said in a statement. “The explanation of suicide does not seem plausible.” Harmonie Harsch, Malcolm Harsch\'s younger sister, said in a Facebook message the family only became aware of his death after they were contacted by a friend the day he was found. She said the family, which resides in Ohio, had to reach out to the San Bernardino County Sheriff\'s Department the next day for confirmation. Miller said a coroner\'s investigator had “attempted to locate a family member” on the day of Malcolm Harsch\'s death but was “unable to reach anyone.” The case does not appear in the San Bernardino County\'s list of coroner press releases, even though more recent cases have been posted. On the same day Harsch was found, a Victorville rally drew dozens of people protesting George Floyd\'s death and other controversial killings at the hands of police. When asked why the Sheriff\'s Department didn\'t notify the public of Malcolm Harsch\'s death considering the ongoing protests, Miller said press releases are not typically issued for suspected suicides. “Amidst the current racial tension and following the protesting the night prior to his body being discovered we were truly troubled to learn of his passing, particularly of how his body was discovered,” Harsch\'s family wrote. “He was an African American male, whose body was found hanging in a tree in Victorville California!” The family said a deputy who called to confirm Harsch\'s death asked about drug or alcohol use, “made a statement about how the coronavirus has \'hit people really hard\' and said a USB cord was used to hang him.” Harsch\'s family said they also spoke to people who were there when he was discovered. “There are many ways to die but considering the current racial tension, a black man hanging himself from a tree definitely doesn\'t sit well with us right now,” Harsch\'s family said. “We want justice not comfortable excuses.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

AB 323 was voted off the Senate Floor and passed by the Assembly in the last few days of the 2019-2020 legislative session. The Senate passed AB 323 by a 39-0 vote; the final vote on the Assembly Floor was 60-2. “AB 323 provides a bridge for our local newspapers to continue informing readers and their communities,” said Assemblywoman Rubio. “The First Amendment and our independent press are critical to the open exchange of diverse ideas and perspectives. My colleagues and I bring varied viewpoints to the Capitol, but as shown by the overwhelming bipartisan support for AB 323, we are united in our support for our local news outlets and the citizens they serve.” AB 323 establishes a path for community and ethnic news outlets to reach underserved communities through state advertising and provides an additional year for ethnic, mid-size and daily newspapers to pursue alternate distribution models while preparing to comply with AB 5. “We are living through times of unprecedented unrest and change, and the need has never been greater for specialized outlets that facilitate improved civic engagement and better cross-cultural communication,” said Regina Brown Wilson of California Black Media. “Assemblywoman Rubio’s leadership and the unwavering support of AB 323’s coauthors and supporters make it possible for our outlets to continue their mission and better inform our communities.” AB 323 was championed by principal coauthors Assemblymember Grayson and Senators Caballero, Dodd, Hertzberg, and McGuire; and coauthored by Assemblymembers Aguiar-Curry, Bauer-Kahan, Chu, Cooley, Cunningham, Diep, Flora, Frazier, Friedman, Gallagher, Irwin, Kamlager, Kiley, Levine, Low, Mayes, Mullin, Obernolte, O’Donnell, Quirk-Silva, Ramos, Robert Rivas, and Smith, and Senators Allen, Archuleta, Bates, Chang, Galgiani, Glazer, Mitchell, Roth, Rubio, and Umberg. “We are grateful to Assemblywoman Rubio, Senate and Assembly leadership, the bill’s coauthors, and every member of the Legislature for recognizing our financial predicament and working tirelessly to protect access to local news,” said Charles F. Champion, president and CEO of the California News Publishers Association. “Almost every recent survey shows that reliance on local news sources has grown over the last year. With the passage of AB 323, lawmakers have shown their faith in local news outlets as the most trusted resource for their communities, and we will continue to rise to fulfill this important need.” “I am hopeful Governor Newsom will sign AB 323 into law because he values the importance of bringing news to our citizens in California,” added Assemblywoman Rubio.

I’d call the L.A. Times and yell into the one-way void of their telephonic voice portal. Nothing would happen. The same affliction, it turns out, befell subscribers of the Santa Barbara News-Press. Had UFOs abducted everyone delivering newspapers on the South Coast? Readers got restless. Newspaper carriers, we would later learn, were among the first casualties inflicted by a well-intended new state bill designed to protect gig economy workers from the manifold oppressions of the gig economy. People who had worked directly for the two newspapers were told they no longer had jobs. They could apply for their old positions, but with a new company with whom the newspapers had contracted. As with all games of musical chairs, a lot of people awoke to discover they no longer had a seat. How many, we still don’t know. Progress, like God, I guess, moves in mysterious ways. I finally met my carrier this weekend. He was searching the street to find my digs. He was a new guy. He was delivering three papers, not just one; his route, he said, was crazy making and confusing. I sympathized. But for myself, as well. If I ever got to read a morning paper again, it would be after I got home at night. The car he drove was chillingly emblematic of the newspaper industry as a whole. The wheels weren’t falling off, but they were about the only thing that wasn’t. The body was slap-dashed with a blizzard of Bondo-gray patches. They alternated with streaky smears of scratched paint. The steering wheel was intermittently wrapped up in duct tape. There was something mesmerizing and primal about it, like a boxer’s wrapped fist or a wounded shark hunting for a cozy place to die. If you read newspapers, you already know newspapers aren’t doing particularly well. Between 2008 and 2018, 25 percent of all journalism jobs in the United States disappeared. According to the Washington Post, the number of lost journalism jobs in the U.S. in 2019 was almost 4,000. For newspapers specifically, the numbers are even worse. Nearly 50 percent of employees found themselves forced to find new jobs in that same 10-year period. Circulation has dropped to the lowest ever since 1940 when economists first started tracking such things. Revenues dropped 13 percent in 2018 alone, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. To the extent there’s been significant new growth, it’s been with online advertising. The bad news there is that half those new revenues go to Google and Facebook, who are doing to newspapers \u200b— \u200bJeff Bezos’s ownership of the Washington Post notwithstanding \u200b— \u200bas they have done to downtowns. If the numbers are grim, the reality is more so. In communities that have not been rendered “news deserts” outright, “ghost papers” struggle to stay afloat, anorexic shadows of their former selves. As exquisitely imperfect as the news media undeniably is, local newspapers provide a service that can’t be replicated by all the aggregators, bloggers, and social media sites combined. At some point, some working stiff has to actually watch all those city council meetings, sit through those long and tedious trials, and talk to all those people who think they have something to say. Because they often do. On good days, we \u200b— \u200blocal newspapers \u200b— \u200bprovide the mud and straw from which the bricks and mortar of communities are built. On good days, we provide the community a thermometer to take the temperature of its soul. On occasion, we have such days. I am, of course, biased beyond belief. As a paid writer, reporter, and editor, it’s in my obvious self-serving self-interest to believe the sun rises and sets according to the treadmill of my deadlines. That being acknowledged, we do bring something to the party. Just look at any community that lost its paper; they’ve become the sound of one hand clapping, the dog that didn’t bark, and the singer without a band. In all that silence, you can no longer hear yourself think. We’re all scrambling to find a new way. Big changes, we are told, are afloat for the much-beleaguered and significantly improved News-Press, though that paper’s new editor, Nick Masuda, has “absolutely and unequivocally” denied persistent rumors that the paper was being sold to the Los Angeles Times. We at the Independent are trying out something new and different. According to Pew Research, only 14 percent of the public pays for local news. We’re trying to increase that number. It’s not asking that much. We’re asking our readers to strip-mine their couches, sock drawers, car ashtrays, and other repositories of errant coins and subscribe to the Independent. Our rates, I have to say, qualify as a steal. For $30 \u200b— \u200b$29.99 to be precise \u200b— \u200byou get a year’s subscription; $2.99 gets you a month. By contrast, Edhat charges $52; Noozhawk suggests donations that start off at $99. We’re considerably cheaper than Netflix or Spotify or any number of those apps you pay for but never actually use. But please bear with us as we work out some sign-up kinks. Technically, this subscription gets you everything the paper has to offer online without interruption or intrusion. Without it, you won’t be able to read everything we’ve posted online, just the shorter stuff. News articles longer than 650 words, for example, will not be accessible without subscriptions. During natural disasters, such as floods and fires, or unnatural ones \u200b— \u200belections \u200b— \u200bour intention is to make sure everyone can get everything. The paper that hits the streets every Thursday will remain, of course, 100 percent free. Mostly, it’s an opportunity to try something new to allow us to evolve and grow. Think of it as a tip; think of it as a donation; think of it as you will, but please subscribe. It’s your way of keeping the dog barking, the one-hand handclapping, and the lead singer accompanied by her backup band.

'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Davis, California HBO talk show host John Oliver uses compassion, sharp wit to engage America on issues we didn’t know we should care about In the second season of John Oliverâ\x80\x99s late night talk show â\x80\x9cLast Week Tonight,â\x80\x9d he announced that he had officially started his own church: Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption. This entire (legally binding) sketch was written to target televangelists who found mega-churches in order to take in millions while being exempt from paying taxes. Oliver proved what little effort creating an organization like this requires and how easily fraud and corporate greed can take advantage of these platforms. The way Oliver clearly portrays a very nuanced political problem with humor in just a 20-minute segment has led to what is now known as the â\x80\x9cJohn Oliver Effect.â\x80\x9d The term refers to the power of Oliverâ\x80\x99s satirical commentary and the lasting effects his messages have on the country. Before getting his own show, Oliver worked as a senior British correspondent on â\x80\x9cThe Daily Show with Jon Stewart.â\x80\x9d Oliver was praised for his work on the show, winning Primetime Emmy Awards for his writing. He then started filling in for Stewart as host of the series, and the public started getting used to him. “He has a very inviting way of having us all take a look at issues around us with amusement, with sadness, with irony,” HBO programming president Michael Lombardo said in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter. “But there’s no cynicism or judgment in it. His observations are always really acute and heartfelt.” This sentiment is what carried Oliver in his career â\x80\x94 and eventually into his own series in 2014. Although he originally had a two-year contract, â\x80\x9cLast Week Tonightâ\x80\x9d still airs today. Oliver has become commonplace in households and classrooms alike due to his ability to explain and support his opinions about topics that might otherwise go over the common person’s head, often leading to significant action being taken as well. The â\x80\x9cJohn Oliver Effectâ\x80\x9d can be seen in the numerous examples of Oliver affecting change in both legislation and national opinion. In 2015, Oliver tackled the issues of the bail bond system, showing the ways it works as a disservice to the impoverished and keeping innocent people behind bars. Soon after, New York officials made plans to change the bail requirements, and Mayor Bill de Blasio issued a statement addressing the problem just a month after the segment aired. One of the most significant examples of the â\x80\x9cJohn Oliver Effectâ\x80\x9d was during the net neutrality debate in 2014. Oliver brought the term â\x80\x9cnet neutralityâ\x80\x9d into the cultural zeitgeist by explaining its significance to the common person in an interesting and understandable way. This alone was a feat of his writing, as too often the terms of net neutrality had been explained in intensly mundane and convoluted ways. â\x80\x9cThat is the most boring thing Iâ\x80\x99ve ever seen,â\x80\x9d Oliver joked after showing a clip of an interview discussing the net neutrality laws at stake. â\x80\x9cI would rather listen to a pair of Dockers tell me about the weird dream it had.â\x80\x9d Oliver used the rest of the segment to explain net neutrality in a way that connected with average people. After explaining its importance, Oliver urged his viewers to flood the Federal Communication Commission with their opinions about the proposed bill. After receiving so many messages at once, the FCCâ\x80\x99s website crashed. The FCC eventually voted to adopt net neutrality regulations, and many credit Oliver in making that happen. The effects of Oliverâ\x80\x99s style are palpable, and he might be changing the face of news as we know it. As more people are growing distrustful of news outlets, people are leaning more toward satire. â\x80\x9cThere is dissatisfaction with mainstream news media,â\x80\x9d said Julia Fox, an associate professor at Indiana Universityâ\x80\x99s Media School in an article in Variety. â\x80\x9cMore people donâ\x80\x99t trust media than do.â\x80\x9d Oliver is intelligent but not pretentious. He explains things that might go above the average personâ\x80\x99s head with wit and, most importantly, factual data to back up his claims. There are no gimmicks or ulterior motives â\x80\x94 just in-depth analysis under the guise of comedy. Oliver truly seems to be on the side of the masses, which enables more action. Especially in todayâ\x80\x99s state of unease, it is hard to know what or who to trust. While Oliver does not gloss over the very real threat the world is currently facing, there is also a comfort in knowing there is someone with a platform who is worthy of being trusted. â\x80\x9cTry your best to tune out and not pass on misinformation in the coming weeks from sources like, sadly, the president.â\x80\x9d Oliver said in a recent segment. â\x80\x9cAnd instead, pay attention to trustworthy information from the CDC, experts like Anthony Fauci and, of course, TikTok hamsters.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:44 am Kami Martin Seven years ago, Kami Martin made a new beginning in life by moving to Galt with her two sons. Her earliest childhood memories are of Hawaii where she lived until the age of five. It made a big impression on her life, beginning with her name. “My parents love Hawaii and lived there both before and after my brother and I were born,” Martin said. “I was born in San Francisco and my brother was born in Hilo. As is tradition, we were both given Hawaiian names by one of our aunties. My name is Kamalani and his is Kaliko. My name means Chief’s child and his, the bud of a flower.” Martin’s family had strong ties to the area and moved back to the mainland to be close to her grandmother. Stockton became the family’s new home where Martin and her brother both graduated from Lincoln High School. She earned an undergraduate degree in government and then went on to earn her master’s degree in business administration. She works as a claim adjuster for an insurance company and aspires to become an attorney. But she counts her most significant accomplishment as “raising two amazing humans.” “I have raised two wonderful young men,” Martin said. “We had some tough times. Kids aren’t easy. The decision to move to Galt wasn’t an easy one. It was one day me saying, ‘nope, we’re out. Lodi is not right for us.’ Galt is the best choice I have ever made. For me, for my boys, for my family.” Both of Martin’s sons graduated from Liberty Ranch High School. Devin, 21, is currently attending Cosumnes River College while working at California Custom Trailers. He and his girlfriend just purchased their first home and are fostering a German shepherd. Derek, 17, is registered to attend Universal Technical Institute in the fall in hopes of becoming a mechanic. Martin has a third “child”, Remi, an 8-year-old German shepherd that, according to Martin, is well trained, knows commands and listens most of the time. She planted both feet in Galt and follows city politics closely while serving on the Measure R Committee. Encouraging Galt citizens to be involved and attend council meetings seems to be her calling. For the past few years, Martin has been steadily increasing her community involvement. It started with the installation of a stop sign at the corner of Carillion and Vintage Oak, and grew from there. “People may have noticed that I don’t take lightly to being ignored or brushed aside,” Martin said. “I have been very active on social media, posting agendas to almost every meeting and attempting to summarize important agenda items so that citizens can understand and quickly reference them.” Martin felt it was very important to try to improve attendance to City Council meetings, as well as Planning and Parks and Rec meetings. “Joe Citizen has not been informed, nor have they been involved in the process, and I have found that citizens have been getting angry after decisions have been made … when it is too late to make a difference,” Martin said. “So I have been making an effort to get them mobilized before those final decisions.” Her father’s strong influence has had a profound effect on her life, according to Martin. He was a stay-at-home dad while his wife worked as a nurse. He was involved in all his children’s school activities, including being the president of the PTA, starting a GATE program and was on the ground floor of Pacific Charter School. “My dad is my hero,” Martin said. “My dad has taught me that I can do anything if I put my mind to it, and this has never failed me. He has also instilled in me my ridiculous research skills. When my brother and I were younger, any time we had a question, what something was, what a word meant, my dad’s response was, ‘go look it up.’ And this was before the internet.” Honesty, kindness, integrity and respect are Martin’s most valued character traits. As a self-proclaimed “straight shooter”, she’s ready to work hard. “I have zero interest in compromising who I am for a position, any position, paid or otherwise,” Martin said. “I will ask questions. I will read every page of every document. I will do the math. If it doesn’t make sense, I will ask until it does.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular articles.

IMPERIAL VALLEY — The National Transportation Safety Board has issued an initial report about the October plane crash near Brawley that claimed the lives of two Holtville-area men. While information from the field work of the probe was completed in December and discusses the circumstances surrounding the crash, it does not yet determine a cause. The report is posted on the agency website, ntsb.gov. The plane occupied by George Morris and Jeffrey Calhoun left the Brawley Airport about 1 a.m. on Oct. 31 and crashed along the Alamo River near Brawley a short time later, the report states. Possible causes cannot be discussed until a final investigation report is filed, said Chris O’Neil, NTSB chief of media relations. The preliminary report revealed only the facts gathered by the first week of December. “It’s still an active investigation and we’ll follow it where it leads us. It’s still too early to discuss the cause of the accident,” he said. “We’ll continue with further investigation, but in general a fatal investigation can take 18 to 24 months to complete,” O’Neil added. “We investigate 1,300 general-aviation accidents per year and that is one of the reasons it requires that much time to make a full report.” What is known is the plane, a Cessna 150A departed runway 8 at the Brawley Municipal Airport at 1:14 a.m. on Oct. 31. Three minutes later, just northwest of the airport, the plane turned to the left then crossed back over the runway in a northeast heading, explained an NTSB investigator. One minute later the plane turned right. One minute and a half minutes after that the plane made another right turn and was on a southbound heading. The last radar return signal was received at 1:19:55 a.m. north-northwest of the accident site. The plane struck the embankment of the Alamo River near Brawley and sustained substantial damage, the investigator determined. The entire plane came to rest upright on the shoreline of the Alamo River in desert shrub trees. There was a path of debris 80 feet long north of the main wreckage.

Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously voted to allow developers to move forward with Thermal Beach Club, a luxury resort development with a 20-acre surf lagoon and up to 326 homes in the eastern Coachella Valley. The approval came with promises from the developer to contribute to affordable housing and infrastructure needs in the unincorporated community of Thermal, just north of the Salton Sea. But those promises rang empty for some residents who continued to criticize the project for catering to wealthy tourists and not current residents\' needs. Board of Supervisors Chairman V. Manuel Perez, who represents the Fourth District that includes the area, said before voting in favor that the project has ""come a long way"" since it was first presented to the board last fall amid a swarm of opposition. Thermal Beach Club will be built by Whitestar Development at Avenue 66 on Kohl Ranch, a 2,000-acre plot of land west of Polk Street. In exchange for approval of the resort, Kohl Ranch agreed to donate some of its undeveloped land for affordable housing, or pay for its development elsewhere. And the club\'s developers committed to a $750,000 fund to pay for water hook-ups for future affordable housing developments, though Perez said that money could be directed elsewhere based on community needs. Perez called these benefits ""unprecedented"" and credited the community\'s vocal advocacy and pushback with getting such considerations on the table. ""This has never been done before,"" Perez said. ""I appreciate the advocacy that occurred over the course of the year, because it got us all to this point."" The project has drawn controversy for being a high-priced, members-only club that will be built in a low-income area that\'s home to many farmworkers and is predominately Latino, according to U.S. Census data. Critics point to the fact that nearby residences lack access to utilities like water and sewage lines. The median household income in the census tract where the club will be located is about $29,500, according to the latest American Community Survey, compared to $53,539 for the Coachella Valley. Memberships for Thermal Beach Club begin at $175,000 for a residence club member, according to an interest form, or begin at $1 million for full-time members who will also purchase homes. Tuesday\'s vote marked the approval of a change of zoning and other planning requirements that will allow the project to move forward. The developer will still have to obtain building permits before beginning any construction. Scott Hildebrandt, senior vice president of Albert A. Webb Associates that handles development for Kohl Ranch, presented the project on behalf of Thermal Beach Club and has been the main point of contact on the project for the county and at the public meetings. Within six months, he said, Kohl Ranch will work with the county to figure out where affordable housing could be sited on its land. In his approximately 40 years of development work, Hildebrandt said this is the first time that there has been this level of community contributions. ""We do recognize we\'re setting a precedent here,"" Hildebrandt said. The Riverside County Planning Commission signed off on Thermal Beach Club last fall, but plans stalled when the county\'s board of supervisors deferred a vote on approval to allow for more community meetings amid resident concerns. Two community meetings had been held before the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, Hildebrandt said the project netted 55 letters of support from community members and property owners. The developers also began working with Juan de Lara, former mayor of Coachella and head of the Salton Sea Action Committee, on outreach and to generate more buy-in. De Lara spoke Tuesday in favor of how the club will raise property values and generate more tax dollars. “This project needs to be a priority, not an option,” he said. About two dozen other people spoke up in support, mostly calling in by phone. Dion Lewis, who said he’s in the property management business and has lived in the Coachella Valley for about 20 years, noted it will bring jobs to the region. Developers cited at least 1,000 to 2,000 construction jobs and 200 to 400 permanent jobs as a result of the project. Ashley Cintas called in to say her family has lived in the valley for more than 50 years and sees private sector development as helping the local economy, plus schools and infrastructure. ""I do feel this will continue to help the valley prosper, and help the communities and our economy,"" she said. About a dozen others voiced their repeated opposition, including several eastern Coachella Valley residents who attended the meeting in-person in Riverside. Karina Andalon said the project is not being built for residents. She pointed to an existing development, the nearby Thermal Club racetrack, that is just a few minutes from a trailer park. For neighbors who live across the street in trailers, the luxury club is an ""ironic"" sight, Andalon said. She expressed concern that more plans like this will be approved, and added that those who want them are outsiders. “People who support the project have only been here once or been here a short amount of time,” she said. Several people said they were concerned about gentrification, including resident Joseph Avila. He said the valley has seen similar pushes before, citing the razing and redeveloping of Section 14 that displaced people of color in Palm Springs in the 1960s. “It\'s not for the community,"" he said of the project. ""If it was, they wouldn\'t have such a high paywall to get into it."" The nonprofit Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability continued to oppose the project, with co-director and attorney Phoebe Seaton saying that the lack of a new environmental impact report could violate state law. While documents used as the basis for Tuesday\'s approval included an addendum to that report, Seaton said the proposed use of the land has changed so drastically with the addition of the surf park that another one is necessary, though county planning staff disagreed. She further criticized the proposed development for creating ""an exclusive enclave of affluent, disproportionately white vacationers."" Rebecca Zaragoza, who grew up in Thermal and now works for the Leadership Counsel, said 337 residents have signed on in opposition to the club amid concerns about how the project exacerbates gentrification, a growing wealth gap and racism. Zaragoza said the community has advocated for investments that will directly address existing needs like clean water, better transportation and affordable housing. Approving the project, Zaragoza said, is ""completely oblivious"" to the current and historic needs of residents. She grew up near the site of the project and said, hypothetically, that seeing the site on the way to school would have been a reminder that her family couldn\'t attain that level of wealth no matter how hard they worked. ""It would have been a constant reminder that because of who we are in the eastern Coachella Valley, we just aren\'t deserving,"" Zaragoza said. ""This type of discrimination and neglect of low-income communities and communities of color needs to stop."" Before casting Tuesday\'s vote, First District Supervisor Kevin Jeffries said he would welcome Thermal Beach Club in his district, which also has low-income unincorporated communities, if not approved for Thermal. He also praised the developers for the ""unprecedented"" deal. Perez said everyone involved in discussions about the club over the past year sees the need for affordable housing and infrastructure improvements. But with its own resources limited, the county has to make partnerships to get those advancements, he said. ""I believe that we are bringing a good faith approach to ensure that our communities in the east end also have the same amenities that others have on the west end, or other parts of the county of Riverside,"" Perez said. ""And I\'m just talking about the basic stuff. Paved roads. Sidewalks. Arsenic-free water that\'s clean and hasn\'t been contaminated."" The Thermal Beach Club developers\' commitment of $750,000 in community funds is based on a $2,300 contribution per each of the 326 homes at the club. Funds could go toward water line connections, but Hildebrandt said they’re open to other possibilities if the county determines it would be better elsewhere. Some have suggested a community park. While the club is not open to the public, the project\'s developer Brian Grantham of White Star put in writing to the county earlier this month that it will offer programs for local surf clubs, as is the case with other surf clubs being proposed for the area, and other opportunities for young people.

The City of Benicia installed a memorial bench for Damani on Jan. 31 at the E. St. waterfront for National Gun Violence Survivors Week. (This article was originally published in the Feb. 9 print edition of the Herald) Galen Kusic, Editor Feb. 1-8 was National Gun Violence Survivors Week. Across the country and world, survivors of gun violence honored and remembered their loved ones lost. Here in Benicia, Justine Chadly, Director/Owner of In Harmony Music shared the story of her son, Damani “Mani” Elijah Chadly, who was murdered in Dec. of 2018 in Fremont at the age of 17. Damani was a senior at California High School in San Ramon and was a talented music producer and athlete. Chadly grew up in Benicia, where he attended Mary Farmar Elementary, swam at James Lemos Swim Center, played basketball at the City Gym and played baseball for Benicia Little League. The memorial bench for Damani Elijah Chadly at the waterfront on E. St. overlooks Southampton Bay and the Carquinez Bridge. His mother described him as “a lovable ball of energy around town.” Although he was set to graduate from Cal High after moving to San Ramon for high school, his Mary Farmar classmates graduated from Benicia High School and wore his name on their hats and shawls to carry them with him last year. “Since the tragedy of losing him, I have moved back to Benicia because it has always felt like home and this community has truly shown the most love and support one could imagine,” said Justine, whose mother and sister also live in town. “Mani” was the inspiration for In Harmony Music, her business she started in town when he was a toddler. She provides a music education studio for families with young children to make music together. “Despite the loss of him, I will continue to love and support all the children of this special town,” she said. The City of Benicia installed a memorial bench on Jan. 31 for Damani at the waterfront on E. St. The bench required an approval process that described who he was in the community and why it was such a tragic loss to all those that knew him. The plaque at the memorial bench for Damani Elijah Chadly was installed on Jan. 31. “He was a child known and cared for here,” she said. As part of National Gun Violence Survivors Week, Congressman Eric Swalwell (D-15) shared Chadly’s story by honoring Damani with a post on Facebook to celebrate the young man’s life and speak out for all those that are suffering due to losing a loved one to gun violence. “In memory of Damani Elijah Chadly, we move forward in the fight to create a world where the safety of our children isn’t left to chance,” Swalwell’s post reads. “Gun violence destroys lives and tears communities apart. No one should have to go through this pain.” To learn more about Damani and other victims of gun violence, please visit The Survivors Network. Stories are found at #momentsthatsurvive. “For moms like Justine and students everywhere—we must do more to end gun violence,” said Swalwell.

The City of Benicia has been in contact with Solano County Public Health Office and is following and exceeding their guidance. In an abundance of caution, the City of Benicia has decided to close the Benicia Community Center effective tomorrow, Tuesday, July 21 to begin a deep cleaning of the entire facility. Staff will be tested, and the Community Center will remain closed until it is deemed safe to reopen. Credits will be issued for all Parks & Community Services program registrations affected by the closure. “We make it a policy not to disclose detailed information to protect employee privacy,” said City Manager Lorie Tinfow. “We will facilitate testing for all employees who may have been exposed and notify program participants as appropriate. The City of Benicia is committed to maintain the safety of our staff, our visitors and our program participants to the best of our ability.” Increased instances of positive test results have been seen in Solano County, in the State of California and in our country. Employees of the City of Benicia, including those who work at the Benicia Community Center, follow recommended protocols such as wearing face coverings, washing hands, and maintaining social distance. When I hear one of our city employees is infected with the coronavirus, I hope for the best,” said Mayor Elizabeth Patterson. “I agree with the decisions of closing city facilities down and those with contact with the infected person quarantine. I am relieved when the person recovers. So far we have had the good fortune of good recovery. I have been proud of our low infection numbers in the city but with increasing concern with the recent uptick.” A significant number of positive cases stem from social and family gatherings. The City of Benicia reminds all residents to follow recommended protocols and avoid gatherings. The City of Benicia has a community services phone line for COVID-19 questions and concerns; call 707.746.4285 or email pcs@ci.benicia.ca.us Solano County Health Officer Dr. Matyas reported that 53 percent of the 2,759 cases – or 1,462 cases – are directly linked to family socialization, and another 19 percent are categorized as “community transmissions,” which the county could not link directly to one person or group. Another 12 percent are linked to workplace contacts. The wearing of face coverings is important along with social distancing and hand sanitizing. I do see more face coverings these days but still get emails about “freedom and liberty,” said Patterson in an e-mail blast. “How much freedom and liberty is there when bars close, restaurants can only serve outside, hair salons close, and now the Benicia Community Center (BCC).” “Connect the dots. We live and work in a community and what we do at home or work or socializing can affect not just your family, older adult relatives, your co-workers but even the community.

artist and maxillofacial prosthetician to provide reconstructive facial prosthetics for cancer survivors, died on March 18 at age 97. She was living in Bristol, Rhode Island, at the time of her death, according to her son-in-law, R. Todd Johnson of Menlo Park. Before moving there, she lived with her daughter and son-in-law, Lil and Todd, residing in Sharon Heights since 2011. Levy was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1922. She knew from the age of 7 that she wanted to be a surgeon, but Hungary’s laws prevented Jews from attending university, and the Nazi occupation ended her dreams, according to her family. Following the end of the war in 1945, Levy attended university for a few months, just long enough to obtain a passport to Austria on her way to an Italian displaced persons’ camp. For the next several years, she became one of a generation of Eastern European wanderers, her family said. Upon her arrival in Italy, she was deported back to Austria because “people with valid passports couldn’t stay in displaced persons’ camps.” Levy plotted her illegal return to Italy with a guide to lead a nighttime trek over the Alps, her family said. In Italy, Levy received her first formal training in sculpting at the Academia Albertina di Belle Arte in Torino, where she began a six-year period that proved to be the most prolific of her career. She later moved to New York, joining her sister and brother. There, she continued sculpting and worked in a medical laboratory. In 1951, she married Michel Levy, who preceded her in death in 1984. Her work as a prosthetician began when she was encouraged to help a friend who needed a prosthetic hand. Without formal training in the field, she worked with scientists at chemical companies who were experimenting in the new field and plastics and foams, and worked to perfect the art of sculpting faces for those suffering deformities, her family said. Although she never became a surgeon, her facial reconstructive work at medical centers such as Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, New York University and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center produced results that received great acclaim in the U.S. and abroad, according to her family. She retired in 1984 as a result of macular degeneration. While living in Menlo Park, Levy had limited mobility because of her vision limitations, but she was active in Stanford Wellness programs and the Peninsula Community Jewish Center, Johnson said. She is survived by her children Diana Levy of Tiverton, Rhode Island, Joseph Levy of Chicago, and Lil Johnson (Todd) of Menlo Park. The family requests that memorial donations be made to USC’s Shoah Foundation, Doctors Without Borders, or the Jewish National Foundation. 1 Comment I knew Magda Levy. I would often see her at the swimming pool in the Sharon Oaks Association. We had many nice chats by the pool. She was a very interesting person who weathered adversity well and will be sorely missed by her friends in Sharon Oaks. You must be logged in to post a comment.

Archives Go to CN&R home page By Melissa Daugherty This article was published on 03.19.20 Forgive me for stumbling here, but I’m still in shock. On Monday (March 16), I learned this newspaper would suspend publication and that our entire staff would be laid off in a matter of days. I stayed up until 5 a.m. trying to come up with a plan to save our region’s longest-serving alternative voice—a Chico institution—and carry on the legacy that a fine group of journalists and free thinkers started in August 1977. Know any billionaire First Amendment champions? Neither do I. Like other small businesses, the CN&R has been knocked hard and fast by the fallout from the coronavirus. Struggling amid the sweeping shutdowns, our advertisers pulled most of what they’d booked into the paper. Last week, we were profitable. This week, we’re not. It’s that simple for a company that runs on small margins, fueled by a passion for journalism more than the almighty dollar. This could be our last issue. And that, dear readers and supporters, would be a heart-breaker. What the exceptional journalists at this newspaper do, week in and week out, is unparalleled in the North State. I say that not to be egotistical but to underscore the crater-like hole the CN&R’s closure will leave in the local media landscape. Think back to our best work in recent years—our watchdog reporting related to local environmental issues, police shootings, city government and, more recently, the 300-plus stories we’ve written on the far-reaching and devastating effects of the Camp Fire. Last week, I learned that we were named finalists in nine categories in the annual California Journalism Awards contest, including for our unmatched local arts and entertainment coverage led by my dear friend, Arts Editor Jason Cassidy (aka Arts DEVO). We compete against the largest weekly newspapers in the state—publications with much larger circulations, resources and staffs. I can’t begin to express how grateful I am to have worked with Managing Editor Meredith J. Cooper, Advertising Manager Jamie DeGarmo, Art Director Tina Flynn, retired Editor Robert Speer and Contributing Editor Evan Tuchinsky over the past 13 years. Or how proud I am of staff writers Ashiah Scharaga and Andre Byik, whose skillful, compassionate reporting has helped so many struggling fire survivors. The thought of not being able to continue this type of journalism—serving as an anchor in our community during this especially worrisome time—makes me incredibly sad. Suffice it to say, depriving myself of sleep did not result in a plan to sustain the operation through this disaster. It’s surreal not knowing whether this is a farewell for now or forever. After learning the devastating news, the CN&R’s reporters and editors did what we’ve always done in the face of a crisis—get to work. Sixteen months ago, that meant driving up to the still-burning Ridge. This week, it’s informing our community on the global threat that has taken away the jobs we love in our beloved community. It’s that type of unflinching response and dedication that sets this publication apart. I know I speak on behalf of our entire company—delivery drivers, salespeople, designers, and especially our owners, Jeff vonKaenel and Deborah Redmond—that we want nothing more than to continue serving our community.

Berman was born and has lived in Mexico City since 1950. She has become a widely recognized screenwriter and director in the world of Mexican theater. She has received Mexico’s National Theater Prize for three of her plays. “Duties of the Heart: A Mexican-Jewish Childhood” was the title of Berman’s speech. “Bubbeh” (Yiddish for “grandmother”) is the title of the book that Berman was discussing and reading from. This is Berman’s only novel that has been translated to English. Dr. Andrea Labinger, professor of Spanish and director of the Honors Program, translated the work from English to Spanish for Berman. “I think Andrea made a very good translation, also a translation to the American reader, which is a difficult task,”said Berman. Dr. Labinger helped read excerpts from the book during the presentation. “I love Andrea to read, it is my stories, but in a different language and is all new to me,” said Berman. “Bubbeh” is about a Jewish girl’s coming of age that has an impact much greater than its slim promises. Sabita, the precocious, rebellious narrator, struggles to define her relationship with her parents, her grandparents, her religion and her emerging self. The short novel is a fictional portrayal of a young granddaughter paying homage to the family member who showed her to the subtlety and sanctity of life, her grandmother, who died in 1980, in her early 70s. “I write fiction because I’m interested in parables. I want to entertain you and give suspense, but when you leave you take something with you. Gives you something besides just a story,” said Berman. Berman’s grandmother taught her to let her body learn what is sacred for the rest of her life. “I remember 10 years ago you didn’t tell anyone you were Jewish. You just didn’t talk about it. We are all Mexicans, we are all the same, so don’t talk about differences,”said Berman. Berman is not so quiet about her heritage now. She is proud of being both Jewish and Mexican. “I am proud of my Jewish heritage and very proud of my Mexican heritage. Why should it be a conflict?” asked Berman to the crowd of about 40. Berman is working on a play about tragedy and comedy. “Bubbeh” will be available for sale in April for $12.95. Contact Dr. Labinger for a copy at ext. 4357.

Was there a particular reason you chose LA? Strangely it was LA that chose us. My partner and I always had a desire to work abroad as teachers due to England’s work-life balance, as well as us both needing more sunshine in our life. We had applied for jobs in various overseas destinations after we had returned from an around the world trip and the first school that offered us an interview was a Charter school in the Valley area. We were successful with our interviews and there was only one choice in our mind to accept the positions. Also, with my passion for music, specifically DJing and producing UK Garage music, it seemed like a no brainer to come to the world’s hub for music and entertainment. What do you miss most from home? To be honest, the underground rave scene. I did not realise until coming to the US how unbelievable the music scene is in the UK from small sweatbox club events, to huge festivals with genre specific stages to suit your mood and taste. My hope as a DJ is to bring more variety to nights out in LA from UK Garage to Deep House and from Grime to Bassline. What was your first impression of LA and has it changed since? First impression of LA when I moved here was that it can be an extremely lonely and fickle place; it’s so important to continue to network and socialize to find the right group of people for you. Some days you may feel you’re taking one step forward and two steps back, but eventually you’ll find your social circle becoming everything you need to support your lifestyle. What do you find the biggest difference is living here versus England? People do not just pop by for a cuppa. As LA is so big and people you meet can come from all over, it is hard for people to swing by for a catch up. You’ll have to book “appointments” to see friends and don’t be too disheartened when they cancel as that can happen frequently! Also the weather, not always, but mostly can not be beaten…so much sunshine 🙂 Do you have a hidden gem in LA that you want to share with us? Well being a Brit I do love my curry and have visited some really great curry houses in LA, but the gem of them all was Masala House in Encino. Great food, service and price! What would you suggest to others who are thinking about making the move here? Be prepared for it to not always go well. This is life and they’ll always be ups and downs but I think with LA being…well…LA, the highs and lows are magnified even greater so when those lows do arise, stay positive and count your blessings as when the highs do come you just can’t beat them. Lots of our members join our group Brits in LA seeking out words of wisdom – what is the best piece of advice you’ve been given? The best piece of advice I received was from meeting a couple from the Brits in LA group for a drink which was “just give it two years”. Adjusting to life in LA has not been an easy transition for us; there have been so many obstacles and hurdles but now that we stuck it out and pulled through them, we feel like we have come through the worst of it and beginning to feel more settled and more like we are at home. Lastly, how can we find out more about you? Are you working on anything at the moment? I am posting links of my DJ events as well as new mixes and mashups from my soundcloud to my instagram page @j_moz_. I have already had two gigs at a club in Hollywood called Avalon and am expecting to have another event in April so follow me on IG if you would like to get updates about upcoming shows. Furthermore, I am always looking for more exposure to the LA music scene and would be happy for anyone to reach out about potential work/collaborations.'}]"

during the COVID-19 pandemic while still trying to provide some sense of normalcy so residents feel at home. Of the usual 1,000 students living on campus, only 150 students currently reside in the Vista La Verne residence hall, with four of them being resident assistants. International students or students with housing needs were eligible for campus housing this fall semester. Those who had viable alternatives to living in the dorm, were encouraged not to return, so those in the dorms could keep socially distanced. The suite style of the rooms, with one bathroom per person, allow residents to practice social distancing among their peers while also placing their safety and health first. Carina Baca, junior psychology and political science major, is a resident assistant in Vista La Verne. She said she strictly follows the residence hall protocols in order to ensure her safety and the well-being of students. “We have areas, like the lounges or the kitchen, where students are no longer allowed to gather,” Baca said. “Weekly COVID tests are also done every Friday, which comes out to residents being tested once a month.” Of the total resident population, 15% of randomly selected students are tested every Friday. Lauren Miranda, junior international studies major, currently lives on campus and said the lack of social interaction with others has brought her a great sense of appreciation of what living on campus looked like before the pandemic. “It’s really eerie seeing how empty the campus is,” Miranda said. “The dining hall is only open for a limited time and never on the weekends, so that has been a bit challenging. But the residence staff has been helpful in trying to stay engaged with us.” At the beginning of the semester, Zoom groups were organized to allow students to get to know each other and their resident assistants without having to leave their rooms. Although the health of residents is their biggest priority, Baca admitted that it has become challenging to engage students in events or programs virtually and build a sense of community during the pandemic. “All our events have to be done online through Zoom or consist of individual activities that avoid crowds from gathering,” Baca said. “This is new to all of us and we’re learning as we go.” In addition to providing masks for students, all essential staff on campus was tested for COVID-19 and several sanitizing stations are set up around campus for the convenience of students. All residents were also provided with a no-contact device that allows them to press elevator buttons or open doors without touching the surfaces. “We are following the state’s and Los Angeles county’s COVID-19 guidelines to provide our students with a safe yet engaging living environment in the best way possible,” Director of Residence Life Eugene Shang said. “We’re trying to figure out how to do things while remaining virtual. Students had to sign a contract prior to moving in and are required to wear face masks and practice social distancing whenever they leave their rooms. At most, there are four people in a six-person or eight-person suite, with no roommates. “A maximum of two people can be inside a room at a time and we are not allowing visitors unless they are special caretakers,” Shang said. From Monday to Friday, the Spot dining hall offers pre-packaged breakfasts, lunches and dinners for students to grab and go. Benjamin Sussman, sophomore criminology major, is also a resident assistant and said that despite the challenges, the residential life team will continue to persevere. “As an RA, it’s been tough here and there, but nothing that cannot be managed,” Sussman said. The Vista La Verne housing office can be reached at 909-448-4052 and is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. Alondra Campos can be reached at alondra.campos@laverne.edu.

In response to the newest mandate, Tim says, “We’re rolling with the punches… 24 hours ago, we decided that we’d have to build an outdoor patio.” With a fighting spirit and a little help from some friends, Rail House was able to turn the parking lot in front of their building into an outdoor dining area and open for business.

The order will take effect at 10 p.m. Saturday, November 21 and remain in effect until 5 a.m., December 21, although it may be extended or revised as needed by the State. The Order does not prevent restaurants from operating after 10 p.m. for takeout and does not prevent community members from going to the grocery store or pharmacy for essential needs or walking their dog in their neighborhood. The Order does not prevent members of the same household from leaving their residences together, as long as they do not intermingle with others while out. This is not an exhaustive list, but we hope these examples will help clarify what residents and businesses may be permitted to do under the State’s Order. It does mean that we must restrict our interactions with people outside of our households for non-essential activities or social gatherings.

Restaurants can remain open for takeout or delivery past 10 pm. There is no required closure time. Grocery stores and pharmacies may stay open after 10 pm. All businesses not operating as part of California’s Critical Infrastructure workforce must close by 10 pm.

Longtime Fillmore resident Josephine Myers will turn 100 years young December the 3rd. Josephine has lived in the area for some 90 years during which she and has seen many changes to our special town. Josephine or Jo as her many friends call her, was born in Nogales Arizona, December 3rd, 1920, to John L. and Gertrude Schleimer. Her father was an Arizona State Senator and dabbled in real estate, while her mother was a stay at home wife. An interesting fact, Josephine was the first cesarean birth in the state of Arizona. Shortly after Josephine’s birth, the family moved to Los Angeles, where her father continued in politics. In addition to being the Vice Counsel to Venezuela, he was also an oil broker. The family soon grew by two with the birth of sons, Jack and Jim. Her parents had many friends in the Ventra County area where the family would frequently visit. In the early 1920’s her father purchased a walnut orchard in lower Bardsdale, at the south east corner of Riverside Ave. and Sespe Street. This was Josephine’s first exposure to Fillmore. The family would often visit the ranch spending weekends and holidays there. Jo says she remembers her mother frequently hosting bridge games for her many friends in the county. There were always many visitors with lots kids to play with. One of her more vivid memories was coming up to the ranch shortly after the San Felicia Dam burst. The disaster which sent a massive wall of water sweeping through the Santa Clara Valley resulting in over 400 deaths. She remembers hearing neighbors saying that there were bodies caught in their walnut trees as well as trash, mattresses and furniture. Jo’s brother Jim recalls hearing his mother say that they eventually recovered 14 bodies off their property. The disaster occurred on a Monday and she remembers going to the ranch that weekend, only to return to L.A. on Saturday morning. A sprinkler system was being installed in the yard and the water to the house was turned off. Her parents did not want to put up with the nuisance. She often wondered, if the water hadn’t been turned off, would have the family returned home Sunday or Monday morning? In 1932, circumstances changed for the family, Josephine her mother and two brothers, Jack and Jim, moved to the ranch thus becoming fulltime Fillmore area residents. Shortly thereafter, their circumstances again changed, and they moved this time into town. For a short time, they lived in town on Sespe Street. They all soon realized that city life was not for them, they preferred country living, so it was back to Bardsdale. They moved into a house on Don Shaw’s ranch where Josephine lived until she married. Jo’s mother, Gertrude Schleimer, continued to live in the house until she passed away in 1965. When the family moved back to Bardsdale, Jo and her brothers started school at the Bardsdale Grammar School. Josephine often talks about living across the river, the experiences she had and the lifelong friends she made. She tells of them riding their horses to town on weekends, to go to the show. They would ride their horses across the river to town, where they would tie the horses to a tree behind Corio’s restaurant on the NW corner of Santa Clara St. and A St. The building is still there today. They would then walk uptown to the show. She said that she’s seen a lot of changes in her 90 plus years here. The buildings along most of downtown, Central Ave., today looks very similar to what it did in the “30’s. The 1994 Northridge Earthquake did alter the landscape a little. She remembers all buildings having awnings that the merchants rolled in and out every day. It was a very friendly environment. Everybody knew the merchants and they knew you, or at least your family. As a kid, you didn’t dare act up, because your parents would know about it before you got home. Everyone shopped right here in Fillmore, no one thought of going out of town to shop. Everything you needed was right here in Fillmore. On Central Ave. between Hwy. 126 and the High School, we had 5 full-service grocery stores. In North Fillmore we had 3 more grocery stores and on Main St. we had 2 or 3 small Mom and Pop grocery stores. We had 2 liquor stores and 2 theaters, we called them shows back then, 1 furniture store, 1 men’s and 3 women’s clothing stores, a couple shoe stores, 4 car dealer ships, 2 drug stores, 4 service stations (I think 12 in all), a pool hall and a miniature golf course. At one point we even had an air strip across the river in the vicinity of the present-day horse stables. She recalls the Fillmore Festivals or May Day as it was called back then.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 1:52 am This letter, signed by the president, was inserted in free food deliveries before local workers removed them. Photo courtesy Beth Pielert Letters signed by President Donald Trump arrived in hundreds of fresh produce boxes this week set to go to Coastside families in need. Staff and volunteers from Coastside Hope and the city of Half Moon Bay removed the unprecedented letters before handing out the boxes in an effort to avoid partisan politics and fear that clients’ information could be reported to the federal government. The letters were printed on White House letterhead and signed by the president. They explained the food program and suggested that residents continue to take COVID-19 precautions. They are being included in a specific set of around 200,000 boxes that come to Second Harvest of Silicon Valley from the USDA’s Coronavirus Food Assistance Program and are sent to distribution partners across the area. Second Harvest CEO Leslie Bacho said the third-party vendor that packs the food program boxes is required to include the letter, but said Second Harvest disagreed with its inclusion. The food boxes make up around 14 percent of the food her organization has distributed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bacho said she is very concerned that the letter implies that Second Harvest is endorsing President Trump or supports his policies and rhetoric. She was clear that Second Harvest does not track or report the immigration status of its clients and does not endorse any political candidates. But Bacho said the time it would take her volunteers to remove the letters from each box would mean less food would go out to the half-million clients they feed each month. Instead, Second Harvest sent a notice to its local partners about the letter and is now including a new note in the boxes it packs in-house that explains the Trump letter and clarifies the nonprofit’s values. “We’re not willing to sacrifice food … getting out to the community because of these letters,” Bacho said. Reports from the online news sites Politico and ProPublica have questioned whether the letter violates the Hatch Act, a federal law which prohibits government officials from using their position or taxpayer resources for political gain. But because the wording doesn’t explicitly reference the election, it may not violate the law, experts say. Coastside Hope Executive Director Judith Guerrero said she found out about the letters in an email from Second Harvest earlier this week notifying distributors that they would be included in any boxes labeled “USDA Farms to Families Food Box,” and that no rules prohibited removing the letters. She and her staff decided to remove them from this week’s boxes both to avoid appearing partisan and because official government documents could create stress for undocumented residents they serve who may worry food banks are collecting information. “We’re not here to be part of one political party or the next,” Guerrero said. “We’re here for our clients.” City of Half Moon Bay Deputy Manager Matthew Chidester made a similar decision this week at the city’s Thursday food distribution. He said that without a tip from Coastside Hope he may never have known the letters were inside the boxes. A half-dozen staff members spent the better part of an hour removing each letter from the boxes before distributing them Thursday afternoon. Chidester said it’s not unusual for food boxes to be used to distribute information in addition to much-needed fresh produce to local residents. But in this case, his staff determined that the content of the letter did not justify the potential harm of including it. “Because it has the White House logo on it, given our service population, it could actually do more harm than good,” Chidester said. “It could create fear.” These particular boxes, Chidester said, were notably larger and full of items like fresh milk, eggs, cheese, vegetables and fruit. He said he hoped that removing the letter won’t jeopardize the city’s ability to receive and distribute these boxes. Bacho confirmed that no groups will be held liable for including or removing the letters. She said that in the four decades Second Harvest has received food from the USDA, it has never seen a letter like this. Bacho said she’s heard from many recipients who are angry, disappointed and confused about the letter. She said she decided to remove a flyer about voter registration from new boxes because, coupled with the president’s letter, it may inaccurately imply that Second Harvest is encouraging residents to vote for President Trump. “This is so painful for us and painful for our staff,” Bacho said. Both Chidester and Guerrero said they will continue to remove the letters from any future boxes they get from the USDA source. “It was certainly frustrating,” Chidester said. “But people are more than willing to make the effort.” ""She and her staff decided to remove them from this week’s boxes both to avoid appearing partisan...""The Democrats\' Cancel Culture.

Bobcat Fire. While an evacuation warning doesn’t necessarily mean an evacuation will follow, it’s issued to strongly encourage residents of the area to “have a plan and make sure you’re ready” for possible evacuation, according to Angeles National Forest spokesman Larry Smith. “Get your documents together, get your pets together, start packing your bags, because it may affect you,” Smith said. “Once a call comes in to evacuate, that means hop out in your car and leave … a warning means you may be impacted.” The Bobcat Fire, which has been burning since Sept. 6, was up to approximately 60,557 acres and 15% contained by 8 a.m. Friday. Some 1,300 fire personnel were assigned to the blaze. Areas under evacuation include Juniper Hills; Devil’s Punchbowl; east of Devil’s Punchbowl; Paradise Springs; south of Big Pines Highway; north of Big Rock Creek; and west of Jackson Lake. In addition, anyone north of Angeles Crest, between Clear Creek Station and Highway 39, are under evacuation order, Smith said. Evacuation routes for Piñon Hills and Wrightwood are Highway 2 to Phelan and Highway 139 to Interstate 15, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. A map of the evacuation warning area is provided on the County website. At 7:21 p.m. Thursday, County Fire tweeted that strike teams are “assembled and ready to protect (Wrightwood and Piñon Hills) if the need arises.” #BobcatFire: SBCoFire Strike Teams are assembled and ready to protect #Wrightwood & #PinonHills if the need arises. An evacuation warning has been issued for these communities. Be prepared, https://t.co/s1A1yDyR3V. Fire info: https://t.co/O83hsYHJid or 626-574-5208 pic.twitter.com/xfTTXwCvuW Ryan Holman, superintendent for Snowline Joint Unified School District, said remote classes were canceled Friday. Additionally, district schools and facilities were closed. Holman said Serrano High School, located at 9292 Sheep Creek Road in Phelan, was ""being staged as an evacuation center in the event it is needed."" The Phelan Pinon Hills Community Services District said an empty lot at 4176 Warbler Road in Phelan is available as an evacuation location for residents with horses. The cause of the Bobcat Fire remains under investigation. The blaze began in Azusa near the Cogswell Dam and West Fork Day Use area northeast of Mount Wilson in the Angeles National Forest. Losses such as structures and homes are not yet being recorded, according to Smith. “We do want to remind people that as of today, all 18 national forests (in California) are under closure until at least Sept. 21,” Smith said. “They’re closed to all general activity, including campgrounds and day use.” At 9:52 p.m. Thursday, Angeles National Forest tweeted that fire crews are ready to “defend infrastructure” at the Mount Wilson Observatory, a 116-year-old site of significant 20th century scientific discoveries and home to valuable transmission equipment. The Bobcat Fire in the San Gabriel Mountains northeast of Los Angeles came within 500 feet of the observatory Tuesday, but efforts like controlled burns to clear fuel, water drops and clearing brush helped protect the facility, Angeles National Forest officials said in social media posts. A firefighter died Thursday while battling the El Dorado Fire, U.S. Forest Service officials said Friday. ""The name is being withheld pending notification of next of kin,"" officials said in a statement. ""Our deepest sympathies are with the family, friends and fellow firefighters during this time."" The firefighter went missing Thursday while battling the fire, CBS2 reported. The cause of death is under investigation. The fire in the Oak Glen and West Yucaipa areas has so far charred 21,678 acres with 66% containment. The blaze was burning actively overnight along Highway 38, San Bernardino National Forest officials said Friday morning. They said the fire has continued to ""make active runs to the north"" and had the potential for spotting — or creating new fires — up to a mile ahead of the main body of the fire. There were no evacuation directives for Big Bear residents as of 8:30 a.m. Friday, though officials recommend monitoring updates. Evacuation orders were still in effect for those living in Mountain Home Village, Forest Falls, Angelus Oaks and Seven Oaks. The fire, sparked by a pyrotechnic device used during a gender reveal party on Sept. 5, has destroyed four homes and six other structures and damaged two homes and four other structures. A Cal Fire official has said that the couple tried to extinguish the blaze themselves, then called 911 and remained on scene until firefighters arrived. The investigation is continuing, and it will be up to the district attorney whether any charges will be filed. For assistance with evacuation accommodations, residents may contact the Red Cross at 800-675-5799. For large animal accommodations, contact San Bernardino County Animal Control at 800-472-5609. The Fire Information line can be reached at 626-574-5208. The Palm Springs Desert Sun and Daily Press reporter Martin Estacio contributed to this report.'}]"

This is not progress. It isn’t even change. It is the conservation of legacy policing. The budget process also comes in the midst of a pandemic when we need to find more cost savings to prevent massive austerity cuts to social safety net programs. The proposed budget cuts of 2.62 percent to the police and 5.7 percent to the sheriff’s budget from last year are less than the steeper budget cuts being faced by 21 other departments which include the Department of Police Accountability (-9.10 percent), Children, Youth and Families (-7.78 percent), Status of Women (-3.15 percent), and the San Francisco Public Library (-17 percent). DIVEST FROM POLICE We call upon the Board of Supervisors Budget Committee to respond to the historic public demand to divest from legacy policing by significantly reducing the City’s law enforcement budgets and refunding the City’s safety social net. Through the efforts of a broad coalition of organizations, potential cuts from the proposed police and sheriff budgets representing over $512.0M have been identified. While all these cuts may not be immediately possible, we urge you to start by eliminating new police recruits and academy classes. We also do not need police in schools and public housing, nor sheriffs in public clinics and hospitals. And, we must end the police units that have historically targeted Black, Indigenous and Peoples of Color including plainclothes officers, homeless and “healthy streets” units, gang units and narcotics units. More can and must be more done by the City’s elected officials to divest from police. Defunding the police is a call to reimagine community wellbeing by reimagining public safety and public health. Defunding the police is a call to take away responsibilities and roles from law enforcement that should be the purview of social workers, mental health workers, and community advocates skilled in resolving conflict without the use of force and guns. Defunding the police is a call to divert significant budgetary resources from law enforcement agencies towards community-informed alternatives to policing and services most needed by Black, Indigenous and People of Color, transgender and unhoused peoples of this City. Defunding the police means putting those funds into early care and education; housing, eviction prevention, and homelessness services; food security, health and wellness; youth and young adults; support for marginalized communities; public safety and health alternatives to policing; and non-profit community partner sustainability. In remembrance of Luis Góngora Pat, Mario Woods, Jessica Williams, Alex Nieto, Amilcar Perez Lopez, Adolfo Delgado Duarte, and the many others unjustifiably executed and maimed by SFPD. Invest in the Lives and Futures of Black, Indigenous, People of Color. #BLM, #DefundThePolice No justice, no peace. More on proposed cuts to law enforcement budgets and redirection of funds can be found here at Justice4Luis.org, DefundSFPDNow.com, DPHMustDivest.com, and the Budget Justice Coalition.""}]"

Metroactive Central | Archives ] Reservoir Logs Christopher Gardner View Lots: Fifty exclusive homes and a country club could become part of this view, stretching from the far shore of Lexington Reservoir up to the horizon, near Summit Road. If an aggressive Oregon-based land company gets its way, the area\'s last big redwood forest may become an exclusive country club and housing tract, complete with stunning views of Lexington Reservoir Story by Jim Rendon Photos by Christopher Gardner CELIA THOMPSON-TAUPIN trundles down a shady wooded trail from her back yard toward a redwood as big around as her kitchen. ""I don\'t usually hug trees, but this one I can\'t resist,"" she says as she squeezes herself against the trunk. Her outstretched arms reach not even halfway around the part of the tree that faces her. In her purple batik T-shirt and shorts, she looks like a flattened doll, all scale lost in the massive trunk. ""They won\'t take this one,"" she vows. ""I\'ll chain myself to it first."" Already, thin yellow ribbons dangle from some branches in the vicinity, marked by Big Creek Lumber as the first step in harvesting trees that reside just a stone\'s throw from a stunning view of Lexington Reservoir, the smog cap of the Santa Clara Valley beyond. As development sprawls up and around the hillsides that frame the valley, this large tract of wild, green forest land could become the next casualty of Silicon Valley\'s accelerating urbanization. Indeed, the whine of chain saws and the growl of logging trucks, usually associated with groves in the Pacific Northwest, may soon echo throughout these hills. And before long, if the land\'s owners have their way, bulldozers will carve up this 1,100-acre plot of redwood canyons, towering Douglas firs and grown-over vineyards, making way for as many as 54 luxury estate homes, a golf course and a country club. The landowner has fired enough shots across the bows of opponents to let it be known that, if he can help it, nothing will stand in the path of his firm\'s development ambitions. Dusting off long-forgotten century-old documents and demonstrating an aggressive resolve to use the courts to intimidate environmentalists, journalists and critics, it has become clear that a different type of player has emerged--one not seen before in this genteel neck of the woods--to press a bold development agenda in this high-stakes battle. BEAR CREEK ROAD winds through the middle of the property, which extends from mountain peaks near Summit Road to Lexington Reservoir. In 1934, Jesuits purchased the 1,100 acres and created the first theological order on the West Coast. They erected buildings and cleared dirt access roads that today wander through the steep forested hillside. In 1967 the novitiate closed, but the Jesuits held onto the land until 1989. In the interim, many of the buildings fell into disrepair. ""In a way the property is less developed now than it was 50 years ago,"" says Mariquita West, who grew up on a mountainous 80-acre stretch of land that runs alongside the property and today shares her home with Thompson-Taupin. ""The swimming pool is filled in, the library has burned down,"" West says. Nature is reclaiming her own. With the valley\'s housing pressures growing and nearly certain money to be made from any vacant piece of land, development has long been a threat for this wild hillside. Environmental groups concerned with its fate first contacted West about supporting a preserve on the property in the 1970s, when the land was owned by the Jesuits. It\'s perfect for a park, says Craig Britton, general manager with the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District, a public entity that purchases land for public benefit. ""There is the capability for camping, there is redwood forest. It is adjacent to the Lexington Reservoir. It is next to a regional park and near the ridge trail. We really want the state to acquire it."" The Peninsula Open Space Trust, a private nonprofit group that buys land to protect it from development, held discussions with the church about the property, but nothing came of the talks. Hong Kong Metro Realty, a firm owned by billionaire Hong Kong casino owner Stanley Ho, bought the property in 1989 for $12 million. Britton says that though there were talks with Hong Kong, it never seriously considered selling the land as a preserve. Hong Kong instead sold an option to former Los Gatos High football coach Pete Denevi to develop a country club and golf course on the lower 210 acres. Denevi\'s plan drew fierce opposition from environmentalists and still hangs in limbo. Unable to sell to Denevi, Hong Kong sold the timber rights on 125 acres to Big Creek Lumber, which is now laying plans to log behind Thompson-Taupin\'s home. In late 1997, Hong Kong cut and ran, selling the property to Arlie Land and Cattle, an Oregon-based corporation, for more than $17 million. The acquired land, with the county\'s largest collection of privately owned redwoods, now looms at the center of a battle between developers, preservationists and loggers. The controversy has spawned threatening letters, a lawsuit, accusations and concern about the fate of the valley\'s southern greenbelt. Since Arlie assumed control, it began dividing the property into developer-sized parcels with the hope of getting a huge return on its money. Arlie has advertised 54 lots for sale at $750,000 a piece. At that rate, luxury home development could bring the firm as much as a $22 million gross return. Web links about Lexington and the developers. Images of public documents referred to in this article. NOT LONG AFTER acquiring the property, Arlie hired Velmir Sulic, a local land consultant, to dig up century-old land patents, one of them signed by Ulysses S. Grant in 1875, to help Arlie create 13 more lots than already were zoned for the property. These lots are much smaller than any subdivision scheme would otherwise create. According to ads run by its real estate company, Acosta Commercial Real Estate Services, Arlie is applying for 16 additional lots using this technique. If approved they would raise the total number of developable parcels to 54. Though legal, many environmentalists see this as evidence of Arlie\'s disregard for county zoning laws. ""It is a misuse of planning laws,"" says Julia Bott of the local Sierra Club chapter. ""We should uphold the intent of existing regulations."" Sulic, however, defends this practice. ""If somebody wants to develop their own land, and if they have existing lots, why not research it and find out how many they really have,"" he says. ""That way you get the best return for your property."" However, when ancient records like these were first presented in 1993 to the planning office in support of a different project, county officials thought differently. Owners of the Lake View Meadow Ranch dug up 100-year-old records in an effort to create additional lots on their property, and the county went to court to stop them. After two years of battling it out, ""the county lost hard,"" the Planning Department\'s Zack Carter says. Now that the precedent\'s been set, counties across the state can do little more than nod and stamp when records of property lines that pre-date zoning laws come through the door. Because Arlie\'s property is on a hillside, and because it is inside the Lexington Reservoir watershed, numerous restrictions on development come into play. Most of the lots fall under the county\'s hillside ordinance, and subdivisions are restricted to 20 acres on some parts of the property and to 160 acres in others. However, by using old land patents, Arlie has managed to create lots that are a fraction of this size. John Musumeci, an Arlie executive who lives with Suzanne Arlie, the company\'s president, acknowledges that some of the lots are as small as one-and-a-half acres. Zoning laws allow what is known as cluster development, where 90 percent of the land is left as open space. Lots could then be as small as 2 acres. Despite the ecological benefits of cluster development, Arlie is not interested. ""We are going to peel off lots the way they exist,"" Musumeci says. Arlie has already placed classified ads in the San Francisco Chronicle offering individual lots for sale. If Arlie manages to sell any of the lots and houses begin to go up, it could ruin the land\'s value as a potential park.

2020 Music, Arts & Culture » Movies Jay Roach (Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Meet the Parents) directs semi-fictionalized drama based on the true story of several women—including Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) and Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron)—at Fox News who set out to expose CEO Roger Ailes (John Lithgow) for sexual harassment. (108 min.) Glen File this film under the infuriating category. The sexual harassment and abuse of power that Roger Ailes (not to mention Bill O\'Reilly) got away with for years at Fox News is horrible, and this dramatization of those events—with Margot Robbie playing fictionalized character Kayla Pospisil as a sort of stand-in for the various other unnamed women abused by Ailes—should raise your ire. I\'m not a Fox News fan in the least, but no one deserves what happened to Carlson, Kelly, and Ailes\' other victims. While Carlson and Kelly get their time on screen, this is Theron\'s movie. She\'s simply amazing as Megyn Kelly, and with a few subtle prostheses elements added around her eyes, she bears an uncanny resemblance to her character, made more uncanny by her adoption of Kelly\'s clipped speaking style. Theron truly disappears into the role. Lithgow is also amazing as super creep Ailes. Lithgow plays him like he\'s the victim of some conspiracy by a bunch of ungrateful women who only got their jobs because of him. A big part of the story is the fear the women have of crossing Ailes. They know he can break their careers. You\'d think this would be a story of female solidarity as they join forces to stand against male dominance, but it\'s more about the fear and competition among these high-achieving TV personalities. Carlson shows the most bravery, but it doesn\'t come until after she\'s fired from Fox. Kelly slowly realizes—too slowly the story contends—that her failure to confront Ailes will mean more abused women. Pospisil\'s relationship with fictionalized Jess Carr (Kate McKinnon), a closeted gay and liberal Fox News employee, is where a lot of the story\'s complicated politics play out. It\'s a propulsive, entertaining film, and my only real criticism is it plays it too safe and lets Fox News and its misogynistic culture off the hook too easily. Anna Theron is spot on in this role. She truly takes on Kelly\'s mannerisms, speech, and look down to every detail. Accused of being a feminist by the higher ups at Fox, Kelly contends that she\'s ""not a feminist"" but is a lawyer and insists on truth and transparency. That gets put to the test when accusations against Ailes come out and Kelly is very reluctant to get involved. Even more envelope-pushing is Carlson, who\'s been punished for her strong will by being relegated to a midday air time and a far smaller audience. Ailes is a wholly unlikeable character, a disgusting and dirty man who uses his power for evil far more than good. He\'s the ""second floor""—everything is decided by him and must be done to his liking. Women wear skirts, desks are clear so they can show off their legs, and loyalty to him is above all else. His private office is also his playground, making young, green female workers hike up their skirts and administer sexual favors in a desperate plea to keep their jobs or move up the chain. Infuriating is right. The fact that most of the women at Fox News were unwilling to believe or support Carlson when she sued Ailes is maddening. The conservative news giant\'s culture is icky at best, and pre-#MeToo movement it was downright gross. Eventually, though, Ailes\' luck ran out and one accusation quickly snowballed into mounting evidence that even Rupert Murdoch (Malcolm McDowell) couldn\'t ignore. The cast did a fantastic job portraying this seedy story; Theron in particular is a shining, albeit frustrating, star. Glen Even though she\'s the principal character in this film, Kelly doesn\'t come off as some kind of hero, mainly because she\'s not very sympathetic. In real life, Kelly has had a hard time continuing her once successful career. After Fox, she rode her notoriety onto her own show on MSNBC, but it was canceled. After MSNBC, she was dormant for about a year, but last I heard she\'s trying to use her Instagram platform as her own media outlet, recording interviews and posting them. I think it\'s fair to argue that her career has been badly damaged, which has continued her victimization—though you could also argue that she keeps damaging her own reputation with comments about blackface and other racist statements. Is she a serious journalist? That\'s not really something this film explores. Carlson, on the other hand, is depicted as being a true journalist interested in taking on real stories. After Fox, she\'s yet to return to TV, but she has continued to advocate for women\'s issues. She\'s the real hero. Bombshell is definitely a worthwhile film, but I\'m not sure it\'s quite as explosive as it could have been. I still recommend it highly, mainly for the terrific performances. Anna It did show the inner workings of a scandal, which was interesting, but as you said, not exactly explosive. Kelly went through her own unwanted spotlight after Trump disliked her debate questions and made the infamous comment about ""blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her... wherever"" and followed up with some pretty nasty tweets with Kelly as the subject. It put her family into a public eye she wasn\'t ready for and seemed to leave her shell-shocked and afraid to cause waves by backing Carlson\'s claims. Instead she chose the ""no comment"" approach until many more women had already come forward. Frustrating behavior to say the least but also relatable. No one wants to be in the middle of a scandal, no matter what side you\'re involved with. The acting here is definitely the key reason to see Bombshell, though it certainly can be enjoyed from home without losing much. I will see anything with Theron in it, and she doesn\'t disappoint here. The rest of the cast holds their own as well, and watching this true-life scandal go down and take Ailes with it has a certain amount of satisfaction. I\'d catch a matinee if you want to see it now, or hold off and rent it from your preferred place when it shows up in a few months.

Sen. Kamala Harris, car and truck rallies in support of President Donald Trump continue in San Luis Obispo County. On Sunday in Paso Robles, dozens of locals gathered at Woodland Plaza II near J.C. Penny’s and drove their cars and trucks around town in a display of support for President Trump. They called it the ‘Stop the Steal MAGA Drag.’ Similar events were held in other cities in San Luis Obispo County and Santa Maria Sunday. Claire McClure organized the drag through Paso Robles. She told the Paso Robles Daily News, “This event was organized by two gals who saw that Paso was not covered. Each city in the county had a MAGA Drag, so we just threw something together. We’ve got more than 20 cars here. We hope that people will see that this is not over. We are waiting for this to progress through the court system. Ultimately, there will be a legitimate call by those who run the election. The Associated Press is not the official election decider.” Several local Facebook groups promoted the event, saying, “Patriots look! This weekend! Find your nearest #StopTheSteal “Pop-Up” MAGA Drag, Central Coast, CA, and join in this Sunday, Nov. 8th! Invite your patriotic friends and family!” Local meeting locations included the JCPenney parking lot, 120 Niblick Road, Paso Robles; the north end of Main Street in Templeton; and Spring Hill Suites parking lot in Atascadero. The rally is part of a nationwide movement to support President Trump. Last weekend a similar rally was held throughout the Central Coast on Oct. 31. The rallies are groups of cars and trucks honking their horns and flying American flags and Trump 2020 flags. Meanwhile back in Delaware, former Vice President Joe Biden has declared victory and is making plans for his administration, however numerous court challenges have been filed because of alleged election irregularities. San Luis Obispo County voted for Biden over Trump by a wide margin, 76,398 votes to 53,438 votes, according to the most recent tally. There are over 30,000 additional vote-by-mail ballots to be counted in the county. Counting resumes this morning. In San Luis Obispo County, Clerk-Recorder Tommy Gong said last week that he hopes to get the election certified by Thanksgiving. \u200b \u200b The news staff of the Paso Robles Daily News wrote or edited this story from local contributors and press releases.

All Rights Reserved. October 10, 2003 Save Mart Center Bond Status Questions By Howard E. Hobbs Ph.D., Editor & Publisher FRESNO STATE -- Universities like Fresno State that sell tax-exempt bonds to pay for construction of athletic venues like The Save Mart Center and then make lucrative deals to sell the naming rights to the facility might soon have to face the loss of purported tax-free status of those bonds. Then, the Internal Revenue Service quietly issued a ruling just made public in recent days, that the privileges gained by individual donors and corporations that purchase naming rights to such facilities as the Save Mart Center, count as a ""personal-business use"" of that property. Tax law states that if the value of personal-business use exceeds a certain proportion of the value of the property and the costs of debt service on it, the bonds\' tax-exempt status is revoked. Public institutions like California State University, Fresno can only make deals worth up to 10 percent of the value of property and 10 percent of the amount of debt, while most private nonprofit organizations have a maximum of 5 percent. Of course, the rule does not apply to for-profit entities, which cannot issue tax-exempt bonds. Fresno State would appear to fall under the categories of public and private institutions covered by the decision. However, because the finding was made in a private-letter ruling, it only settled how existing law applied to one particular case and cannot cited at this time as precedent in other cases, according to IRS spokesperson, Anthony Burke. Some experts are worried about how the IRS interpretation will affect those who bought tax-exempt bonds to help finance the Save Mart Arena. The ruling could have a big effect on many colleges and university athletic facilities like Save Mart Center. Linda B. Schakel, an expert on tax-exempt bonds, who is president-elect of the National Association of Bond Lawyers told reporters, when she worked for the Treasury Department in 1997, she helped write the law on which the IRS based the private-letter ruling, she says. ""It\'s a little bit different than controlling how your name appears on concessionaires\' cups and janitors\' uniforms."" Joseph R. Irvine, a tax lawyer for Ohio State University, told reporters, this week, ""...any institution that sold tax-exempt bonds to pay for any new construction should be concerned."" Most issuers, including colleges, he says, ""will see that this is the position the IRS would take on an audit."" Universities, colleges and schools often seek o pay for new construction with tax-exempt bonds through their local or state governments. The tax-free status of the bonds makes them attractive to potential buyers, who would be upset if they found out after purchasing what they were told was a tax exempt security, to find out later that they owed back-taxes and penalties on them after all. Selling naming rights to the Save Mart Center also brought in big bucks to the University. In the biggest tax bond deal of its kind we know of, Fresno State is getting $40-million over 20 years from Save Mart Corp., a regional supermarket chain, for naming the arena its ""Save Mart Center."" But naming rights carry with them particular effects on any tax-exempt bonds used to finance the construction, according to tax attorney, Gregory V. Johnson, a specialist in public finance in the Denver office of Patton Boggs, a law firm. ""It\'s not just putting your name on a building, it\'s putting your name on a building for a business purpose."" For example, if John Doe personally donated $20-million to his alma mater, and, in gratitude, it named a stadium for him, the bonds would be tax-exempt. But if his company paid the institution $20-million to put its name on a stadium for advertising purposes, the bonds might be taxable. Their status would depend on whether the institution was public or private, and whether the payments met either the 10- or 5-percent maximum, respectively. The ruling will affect colleges more than cities and municipalities because colleges tend to build smaller facilities, Mr. Johnson says, explaining that the proportional value of naming rights increases as the size and cost of facilities decrease. Mr. Irvine believes that a naming-rights gift for Ohio State\'s new arena, as an example, falls safely below the 10-percent ceiling. The university used tax-exempt bonds to build the facility, where its basketball and hockey teams play and other events are held. OSU received $12.5-million in 1998 from the Schottenstein family, which owns Value City, a national discount-store chain, to name the facility the Value City Arena at the Jerome Schottenstein Center. Deborah Adishian-Astone, executive director of auxiliary services at Fresno State, told reporters Fresno State sold it\'s tax-exempt bonds to finance the Save Mart Center. According to Treasury Final regulations, sale of naming rights and tax exempt bonds may not give rise to investment-type property if it is made for a substantial business purpose. [Editor\'s Note: Go to related tax-exemption story. Also note that according to Fresno State, in the bond sale to fund the Save Mart Center \x96 an unorthodox style of collegiate financing was devised in order to obtain public funds for the purchase of investment bonds that contractually obligate income streams, including naming rights, corporate sponsorships, private gifts, luxury suites seat licenses for the operation of an athletic facility on campus. Note that these bonds were put up as the sole source of security for the construction project. The Bulldog News has been informed that a sponsorship arrangement between Save Mart Supermarkets and Pepsi Bottling Group started the fund-raising melee back in 1998. The move soon led to Pepsi\x92s financial backing of the Fresno State Savemart Center following the university\'s strategic switch from its former Coca-Cola vending machines on campus. Local businessman Larry Shehadey then donated the eight-story clock tower at the main entrance.] Comment ©1958-2003 Bulldog Newspaper Foundation. All Rights Reserved.

Worse yet, state funds for the California State University System fell by more than $345 million. The state\'s community colleges have been cut by 9.4 percent, a hefty $240 million.

Certain communities have been impacted to a much greater extent, and the community of people with disabilities have been dealt with an extra layer of challenges. While life has slowed in recent weeks, the effort around people with disabilities has only picked up. “If anything, COVID-19 has made us busier than we would be at this time of year,” said Carrie England, the Executive Director at the State Independent Living Council (SILC).

Gavin Newsom back in late April. “The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed long-standing racial and economic disparities in access to health care, technology, jobs, communication and social services,” read the letter. “These disparities intersect with disability, doubly disadvantaging adults and children with disabilities from immigrant communities, other communities of color and poor families.” This has been evident in the numbers released by local counties.
