of groundwater in the water cycle On Dec. 31, UI was awarded a grant for a modeling project that seeks to enhance resilience to water scarcity across the nation. The project is titled “Improving Hydrological Predictions across the Continental United States through Better Characterization of Below-ground soil-vegetation processes.” This grant, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 104g National Competitive Grant, was for more than $618,000, according to a news release. The federal funds are $309,324 with 100% matching funds from the university. According to the project description, “The overarching goal of this project is to improve water budget predictions over the Continental United States (CONUS) through better characterization and parameterization of below-ground soil-vegetation processes. Improving water budget predictions is fundamental to enhancing the nation’s water supply and availability. Vegetation dominates the partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration, streamflow, and land water storage. Climate change and human-induced land use change will significantly impact vegetation behaviors and, thus, the water cycle.” The completion of the project will be led by Meng Zhao, assistant professor of earth and spatial sciences at UI, in collaboration with Yanlan Liu at Ohio State University and Howard Reeves at USGS Upper Midwest Water Science Center. The grant will fund the completion of a hydrologic model, which is a representation of the real-world water cycle to understand and successfully manage water resources. This model will stand apart from others as it factors in the role of groundwater in the water cycle. Most current models do not account for how soil and vegetation interact with water. However, this model will consider how much water can be held in the root zone, how much water plants take up, and how water flows across different types of soil layers. The model’s findings are predicted to improve the modeling of water supply and availability across the United States. As the climate evolves, this becomes increasingly important as water may become scarcer. The model will also help scientists understand how the nation’s water budget is changing, Meng Zhao claimed. According to the USGS, a water budget is a tool that accounts for the rates of water movement and changes in water storage throughout different parts of the atmosphere. Better comprehension of the water budget will lead to an increase in the nation’s resilience to water scarcity. The model will be modified to incorporate various water budget findings to create the most refined and reliable model possible.

months ago Ramona Hatchett moved into her new home in Riverdale on the Narrows Estate. Her home in the center of Mink Creek was purchased by Jamie and Carl Osborne. They have two children, Shyla and Carl Jr. The Osbornes also own a small house on their property, often referred to locally as “little house” and it has been occupied occasionally by Carl’s uncle or other relatives. The family is welcomed to the community. Devin and Maria Flake and their son Jude were up from Orem, UT, to celebrate Maria’s birthday with her mother Lana and Ivan McCracken. Maria had some health issues some months ago and is doing well, one more reason for celebration. Jesse and Annavelynn Wilcox and their son Desmond have recently returned from a winter vacation to Central America. Besides the warmth and the beauty there were all sorts of things for a little boy to investigate that were completely different from his backyard in Mink Creek: insects, animals, jungle growth, oceans, even shopping and new foods. All of this made for a wonderful time in Costa Rica and Honduras for these three. To help battle the winter-time blues, or blahs, each Thursday evening, starting at 5 p.m. there will be the opportunity for residents to gather at the recreation hall of the LDS Meetinghouse for some activities. A carpeted area will be available for yoga, pilates, mobility and balance strengthening moves. Participants should feel free to bring a mat if they prefer. All are welcome and all levels of fitness are welcome. There is the social side of just attending. The gymnasium floor will be set up as a pickle ball court. Again, all are welcome. The earlier hour will be reserved for beginners and anyone wanting to learn the game. Competition is not the aim of this activity, fun and friendship is the goal. Clifton/DaytonBy CAROLYN SMART Happy February to everyone! One month closer to SPRING!!! Welcome home to Sister MaKayla Hatch, daughter of Aubrey and Jeramie, from her LDS mission in Yakima Washington. She will report her mission in the Oxford Ward on February 11th at 9:00 am. I know I’ve said this before, but if you want your life to fly by just write a weekly newspaper column. Or, serve an LDS mission. Every other day seemed to be Sunday. Our weather lately has been crazy. One week we are snowed in, the next week our yards are full of mud from the spring thaw. I love this joke I found and it really applies lately. “With all this rain we need an ark. Fear not! (Wait for it…) We Noah Guy!” I’ll let myself out. Have a great week!!!

Winds light and variable. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:37 pm KAMIAH — A game of duck-duck-goose kept the girls of Kamiah’s Upriver Youth Leadership Council (UYLC) cheer squad entertained while their coach Kylee Loewen and a few helpers unpacked and plumped up the golden pom-poms for the morning practice. Loewen, head teacher for the UYLC K-6 After School Program, began the activity at the request of some of the girls at the Kamiah elementary and middle schools earlier this year. “I formed a cheer team when my own daughters asked me to start one when they were in school. It lasted a couple of years until interest petered out,” Loewen said. It is clear the girls this year are very interested. There are 27 enrolled in the program, and there were at least 20 who came to the practice on a no-school Friday morning, Jan. 26, at 10 a.m. in the Kamiah Elementary multipurpose room. Participants are in grades 1 through 6, and all were dressed in their uniforms of black skorts and Kamiah Kubs T-shirts, with their names on the back. “It’s a lot of fun, and I like going to the basketball games,” said one of the girls. This year the squad is leading cheers for the basketball teams, and Loewen hopes it will continue for the other sports, including football next fall. When called to attention to line up for photos, the girls promptly stopped their game and followed directions quietly and cheerfully.

77 Sat 85 by First Alert Weather Team TOPICS: ARLINGTON, Va. (7News) — In a couple of months, the 2024 cicada emergence will be underway across very specific areas of the United States. This year will be particularly rare in that two different broods will be emerging almost simultaneously for the first time in 221 years, according to AccuWeather. Many species of cicadas live underground for years at a time before emerging in mass quantities believed to be a defense mechanism to outnumber predators. Dr. Floyd Shockley, Entomologist and Collections Manager at the Department of Entomology at the National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian, says that there\'s 7 species of periodical cicada in 15 broods that emerge any given year. 2024 will be a year where 2 of the 15 broods will emerge around the same time. These are the Brood XIX, which emerges every 13 years, and the Brood XIII, which emerges every 17 years. Dr. Shockley says it\'s entirely possible there will be a trillion cicadas that emerge between both broods this year. Cicadas may look threatening, but they\'re actually very harmless. Dr. Shockley says cicadas don\'t bite, are not poisonous to domesticated animals like cats and dogs, and they won\'t harm your gardens. He also says that spraying pesticides will not kill cicadas, and can cause more harm to other animals such as birds and other small animals. Cicadas live very peculiar lives. They live almost entirely underground feeding on nutrients until the soil reaches 64 degrees on the year of their brood. Once the soil is warm enough, they will emerge from underground by the billions and have a life span of about 6 weeks. This year, Brood XIX will be visible in extreme southern Maryland and southeastern Virginia. Dr. Shockley says it is believed that cicadas were brought to North America during the last ice age as a result of glaciation. ""And if you overlay the map of 17-year broods with glaciation during the last ice age, it\'s almost identical,"" Dr. Shockley said. Cicadas are found mostly in the central and eastern portion of the United States and extend into areas in the upper Midwest like Missouri, Illinois, Iowa and even as north as southern Wisconsin. Once they emerge, they don\'t travel very far before they eventually die, which is why they\'re found in certain areas across the U.S. which is why their locations are relatively sparse. Another reason for their unique positioning across the country is the lack of trees west of the Mississippi River. Lush forests turn into grasslands, which are not habitable environments for cicadas. Cicadas are known to emerge exactly when soil temperatures reach 64 degrees, so as our climate continues to change, warmer winters are leading to an earlier cicada emergence. Dr, Shockley said, ""And so because of climate change that is happening earlier and farther north than it previously has, so it has the potential to have them coming out earlier. That used to be a late May thing. Now it\'s extending into April that we start to see the emergence. And that\'s due exclusively to temperature changes related to climate change"". Warmer soil temperatures are also leading to cicada populations migrating to areas where they were never seen before.
