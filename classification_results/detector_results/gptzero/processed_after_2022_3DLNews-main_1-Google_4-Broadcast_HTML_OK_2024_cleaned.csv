The email, obtained by NewsChannel 8 outlined that Oklahomans for Equality was in need of immediate assistance. It started by recapping an investigation NewsChannel 8 first reported on back in October when Oklahomans for Equality accused a former volunteer of embezzling upwards of $135,000. Tulsa Police initially said it was investigating, but could not provide any updates on the investigation as of Friday. NewsChannel 8 was asked to reach out again on Monday. ""The current Board and staff have also been dedicated to rebuilding trust with the community and making the Center a place where every single person feels welcomed,"" the statement read. The email went on to describe the importance of Oklahomans for Equality, calling it vital to the fabric of the Tulsa community. ""OkEq provides social connection, a place for people to gather safely, gender-affirming health care, support groups, and mental health counseling,"" the email said. ""We uplift queer artists, performers, and stories. The library provides access to books that are being censored for students in school. People across the state look to OkEq as a beacon of hope and light when state legislators try to invalidate people’s identities and strip away our human rights. The work that happens at the Equality Center is truly life-saving and life-giving."" The email went on to note that Oklahomans for Equality needed community support to keep staff employed and services available. NewsChannel 8 reached out to an Oklahomans for Equality spokesperson Friday. We asked for an interview regarding the urgent need and a fundraising event on Saturday organized to help. The spokesperson directed us to Board President Eric Wilson and Vice President Bob Hanson for comment. Hanson responded to a request for an interview, setting it up with Wilson on NewsChannel 8\'s behalf. NewsChannel 8 noted that we would be asking questions about the urgent need outlined in the email and about an event on Saturday aimed at helping Oklahomans for Equality. Hanson asked NewsChannel 8 if questions could be provided beforehand, but NewsChannel 8 declined, stating that we wouldn\'t air answers to questions Wilson wasn\'t comfortable answering. NewsChannel 8 arrived at the agreed time of the interview Friday, and were met with a prepared statement written on cue cards; that was not previously discussed. Wilson agreed to answer NewsChannel 8\'s questions initially, and the interview proceeded from there. The organization\'s leaders, however, provided limited details on the urgent need for funds, only continuing to emphasize he importance of continued community support. ""We just want to continue to be able to provide services to the community and the people that need it,"" said Board President Eric Wilson. ""Are you guys at the point where if you don\'t reach a certain amount the doors will definitely close or can you go on for a few months where are we at?"" NewsChannel 8\'s John Hayes asked Wilson. NewsChannel 8 was asked not to use the answer to that question, referred back to the email sent to subscribers, even though it didn\'t answer all of the questions surrounding the urgent matter. Wilson was able to talk about the Saturday fundraising event though, although most of the answers to those questions were read from the prepared statement. ""We are holding a thumbprint fundraiser,"" said Wilson. ""For a $100 donation an individual can add their unique thumbprints and signature to our home, the Dennis R. Neill Equality Center."" A Facebook event created for the event and the subscriber email said that it\'s part of the non-profit\'s goal to raise $100,000 by Valentine\'s Day. The thumbprint fundraiser is from 4-7 p.m. Saturday. The non-profit is encouraging donations before or after the event, but said that only onsite donations will be honored for the thumbprint. After an initial attempted interview with Wilson, board member Dr. Zoe Brett stepped in to do another interview. They told NewsChannel 8 they would not be answering questions, and mostly only reading from the prepared statement. NewsChannel 8 asked them a question regardless in hopes of getting to the bottom of how urgent the need actually was. ""Is there anything else you can say to stress the urgency of people donating and helping you all?"" NewsChannel 8\'s John Hayes asked. The question was met with a mixture of points already made in the prepared statement. ""We are at risk of closing our doors, and we are holding a fundraising campaign, 100k by Valentine\'s Day, to please ask our community members and supporters, whether as a corporation or private entity, to please give us those dollars so we can continue our work,"" said Dr. Brett.. As Oklahomans for Equality faces this financial crisis, supporters, community members and even media outlets are left with unanswered questions.

LEILA FADEL, HOST: His report finds, quote, ""evidence"" that Biden, quote, ""willfully retained"" the classified material from his vice presidency. Yet the same report repeatedly gives reasons that the evidence falls short and would not be likely to persuade a jury, which is why Robert Hur declined to prosecute. INSKEEP: NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas has been reading. Ryan, good morning. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: What do you find in these hundreds of pages? LUCAS: Well, look. This is a long report, but it does focus on a couple of sets of classified materials that FBI agents found in their searches of Biden\'s homes and office. One are documents related to military and foreign policy in Afghanistan during the Obama administration, and the other are handwritten notes that date to Biden\'s time as vice president. Biden jotted down notes in these things during intelligence briefings with President Obama and in White House Situation Room meetings. Some of this material is classified. And it\'s some of that material that Hur says that Biden shared on at least three occasions, the report says, with a ghostwriter that he was working with. But as you said, there are no charges here. The report says, ultimately, the evidence doesn\'t support bringing charges. It doesn\'t establish Biden\'s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Hur says in the report that it would be hard to prove that Biden willfully intended to break the law. And it also describes him as a, quote, ""sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory"" and says it would be hard to convince a jury to convict him. INSKEEP: And unsurprisingly, Republicans have jumped on that last part, describing Biden as an old man with memory problems. How is the president responding to that? LUCAS: Well, look. Legally, this report is good news for Biden in the sense that there are no charges. But that doesn\'t mean that it can\'t still create political problems for him. And the parts of Hur\'s report that raise questions about his age and mental acuity are certainly a case in point. There\'s even a line in there that in his interviews with investigators, Biden didn\'t remember the year his son, Beau, died. Biden talked to reporters last night, and he took that remark head-on. Let\'s take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, wasn\'t any of their damn business. LUCAS: You can hear in that comment there how upset Biden was. And he said there\'s no reason for what he called such extraneous stuff to be in the report. And he said the bottom line here is that there are no charges. And this investigation is now closed. INSKEEP: Former President Trump is facing criminal charges for the way that he handled classified documents and, of course, is claiming now that he is being treated differently. What is the response to that? LUCAS: Well, look. The Justice Department rejects any allegation that there\'s a two-tier justice system in this country. It\'s worth pointing out that Robert Hur is a Republican. Before he was appointed special counsel, he served as a U.S. attorney during the Trump administration. Now, yes, you have a Biden case. You have a Trump case. But there are significant differences between those two cases. Hur even points them out in his report. Trump was provided multiple opportunities to return the classified documents that were found at Mar-a-Lago. According to the indictment, Trump refused to do so and even actively sought to obstruct investigators by trying to get others to destroy evidence and then lie about it to investigators. Biden, on the other hand, he voluntarily turned over classified documents to the National Archives and Justice Department after they were found. He then voluntarily agreed to FBI searches of his homes. He sat down for an interview with Hur\'s team. So, as Hur says, there are significant distinctions between these two cases. INSKEEP: In fact, the special prosecutor says at one point the fact that Biden agreed voluntarily to searches of his home implies that perhaps he did not realize that classified documents were there. Ryan, thanks so much. LUCAS: Thank you. INSKEEP: That\'s NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: We now have the story of a former president who made false claims of a stolen election. FADEL: No, we\'re not talking about Donald Trump, but he was friends with him. Ex Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is facing mounting evidence that points to him participating in efforts to overturn the results of an election that ultimately unseated him. Yesterday, federal police showed up at his residence and forced him to hand over his passport. INSKEEP: NPR South America correspondent Carrie Kahn is in Rio de Janeiro. Hi there, Carrie. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning. INSKEEP: What is the new evidence? KAHN: Well, first, Bolsonaro was not arrested yesterday. Several of his close aides were. And the federal police then unveiled its case of Bolsonaro\'s alleged participation in an attempted coup in this 130-page detailed documents which has a lot of stunning evidence, Steve - much that we have not heard before. The investigation names dozens of people who worked with Bolsonaro, allegedly well before he lost his reelection bid back in 2022. They include military personnel, his former defense minister, his former justice minister and a national security adviser. And the level at which Bolsonaro orchestrated much of - police says was a vast conspiracy to overturn the election results is new, too. At one point, police say Bolsonaro edited a document that outlined how the coup would unfold, including which leaders in the government would be arrested and who would not. And that edit included the arrest of a justice of the Supreme Court. INSKEEP: Wow. Wow. So these things didn\'t necessarily happen, but he\'s editing a document that is the plan. Can you now fit this into the context of what we already knew about his failed effort to overturn his defeat in 2022? KAHN: Sure. He claimed it was voter fraud and that Brazil\'s all-electronic voter system was defective. His supporters spent months camping out in front of military barracks, hoping the army would intervene and overturn the results of the election. When that didn\'t happen, the supporters ransacked the capital on January 8 of last year. Bolsonaro has denied he had anything to do with that attack. Unlike Trump, who was - the two were close allies when they were both in office. Bolsonaro has already been barred from running for office until 2030 by electoral authorities. And like Trump, Bolsonaro is also facing many more cases that could land him in jail. INSKEEP: How is he responding to this latest police raid that grabs his passport? KAHN: Well, the current president, I\'ll tell you first, said that he hopes the investigation of Bolsonaro is professional and unbiased. He did add that he didn\'t think the coup attempt could\'ve happened without Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro, as always, has denied any wrongdoing and says he\'s being politically persecuted. I spoke with Brazilian political scientist Guilherme Casaroes, who was hopeful, despite learning how the right-wing former leader tried to undermine Brazil\'s democratic consensus. I want to play you a little bit about that. You know, this democratic consensus has been in place since the country returned to democracy after the military dictatorship. GUILHERME CASAROES: Even though there were very powerful people - people in office, in power - plotting against democracy, somehow democratic institutions have worked and have been able to save democracy from a complete meltdown. KAHN: He says Brazilians should celebrate that. INSKEEP: OK. Where\'s the investigation go next? KAHN: Well, there\'s a lot of evidence to go over from yesterday\'s police action and possibly new plea agreements from aides of Bolsonaro that were arrested yesterday. And all of that could prove very problematic for Bolsonaro. INSKEEP: OK. NPR\'s Carrie Kahn, thanks so much. KAHN: You\'re welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Let\'s go to Ukraine next, where President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he is sidelining his military commander as Russia\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches its third year. FADEL: Yeah, Zelenskyy posted on X that the country\'s army needs a, quote, ""renewal"" and that he asked his outgoing general to remain part of the team. INSKEEP: Christopher Miller joins us next. He\'s a reporter for the Financial Times based in Kyiv and author of the book ""The War Came To Us: Life And Death In Ukraine."" Mr. Miller, welcome back. CHRISTOPHER MILLER: Thank you. Good morning. INSKEEP: OK, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi was very popular, if I\'m not mistaken. So why replace him now? MILLER: He was. You know, Ukraine\'s war effort right now is stalled and in a bit of trouble.

In a video taped after the interview, Carlson told viewers that he found Putin to be sincere, if not adept at making his case to an American audience. ""He denied it, but it\'s obvious he\'s very wounded by the rejection of the West,"" Carlson said. ""Like a lot of Russians he expected the end of the Cold War would be Russia\'s invitation into Europe."" It is the first interview Putin has granted to an American since the Russian invasion two years ago. The pairing should not come as a surprise. Carlson has routinely been lionized by Kremlin propaganda outlets; his clips attacking the Biden administration\'s support for Ukraine have been routinely rebroadcast, for example. Russian media has fawned over Carlson this week, giving his comings and goings in Moscow a treatment akin to U.S. media\'s coverage of Taylor Swift. Carlson filmed a video to promote the interview on the rooftop of the Ritz Carlton Hotel near the Red Square, a location that, according to Russian journalist Yevgenia Albats, spoke volumes of the regard the Kremlin held for Carlson. ""Its roof is controlled by one of the KGB\'s successors, the Federal Security Service,"" she postedon X, formerly known as Twitter. ""No one of us, and no one other foreign journalist, except for Oliver Stone, had that luxury of reporting from the roof top."" Few have done more than Carlson to lift up the Russian leader as a figure of admiration in Republican circles, just as he has propelled the otherwise relatively obscure Viktor Orban, Hungary\'s autocratic leader, to star status. In that promotional video, Carlson had said he wanted to interview Putin about the war in Ukraine to learn the truth – and because other American journalists were too biased against Russia to want to do so. This was clearly false; Reporters at CNN and the BBC and executives at NPR and Fox were among those who said their networks would be eager to interview Putin without conditions. Even the Kremlin contradicted Carlson\'s claims, saying it had received and rejected requests from ""exceptionally one-sided"" U.S. outlets. So was it a hard-hitting interview holding a wartime leader to account? Putin dominated the conversation – which exceeded two hours – with long, discursive asides relying on propagandistic talking points to argue that Russia\'s right to eastern Ukraine spans centuries. (Ukrainian leaders and many historians dispute his rendering of the history of the region.) The Russian leader blamed the Ukrainians for the 2022 invasion. Carlson did not question Putin\'s framing. Nor did he use the word ""invasion"" to describe the deployment of Russian troops and missiles into Ukraine that kicked off the war. ""We were protecting our people, ourselves, our homeland and our future,"" Putin told Carlson, according to the interpreter of the exchange. Putin appeared to have done opposition research worthy of the KGB agent he once was. He needled Carlson at separate moments about having been a history major and having applied (unsuccessfully) for a position at the Central Intelligence Agency. At the tail end of the interview, Carlson pressed Putin to release Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned by Russian authorities nearly a year ago on charges of espionage - charges the newspaper stoutly rejects. He suggested Putin should not hold Gershkovich as a pawn to trade for, say, the release of a Russian spy. ""The guy\'s obviously not a spy, he\'s a kid,"" Carlson said of Gershkovich. ""And maybe he was breaking your law in some way, but he\'s not a super spy and everybody knows that. And he\'s being held hostage in exchange, which is true. With respect, it\'s true. And everyone knows it\'s true."" Carlson did not raise the fate of Alsu Kurmasheva, a dual U.S.-Russian citizen who is a reporter for the U.S.-funded network Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. She was detained and charged last year with failing to register as a foreign agent. And Carlson notably did not press Putin on thearrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court for him and his child welfare commissioner on accusations of war crimes. ""I\'m from La Jolla, California. I\'m not flacking for Putin. Please,"" Carlson said in the post-interview video. He then said ""professional liars in Washington"" want to convince the public that Putin is a modern-day Adolf Hitler, and called State Department officials idiots for thinking Russia has expansionist ambitions into Poland or other countries. ""We are run by nutcases – the president and that poisonous moron, [Acting Deputy Secretary of State Victoria] Nuland,"" Carlson said. Carlson has spent years attacking those who made the case that the Russian regime sought to sow discord in the 2016 elections through online disinformation, that former President Donald Trump\'s campaign took advantage in the chaos, and that some of Trump\'s key allies had links to the Russians. Trump\'s national security advisor, Michael Flynn, resignedafter it was revealed he had lied about specific policy discussions with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. ahead of taking office. Carlson also has spent much of his time trolling both his former network and Trump critics, while leaping to defend those who laid siege to the U.S. Capitol in January 2021 in an effort to prevent the certification of President Biden\'s 2020 win, despite the protests of some of his colleagues at Fox. Fox News fired Carlson – then the network\'s biggest star – last spring. His key role in amplifying baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 elections had been revealed in a defamation lawsuit against the network that led to a $787 million settlement; Fox paid another $12 million to settle claims by a former producer that Carlson had created a sexist and bigoted workplace. Evidence that became public demonstrated Carlson\'s wide-ranging contempt — for his viewers, Trump, his reporting colleagues and, particularly, the executives who ran his network. After being kicked off Fox, Carlson moved his operation to Twitter, saying it was the last major bastion of free speech. He then launched the digital Tucker Carlson Network. Carlson has used that platform to interview subjects including the extremist conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who filed for bankruptcy after families of schoolchildren murdered in a Connecticut massacre won a $1 billion settlement against him; Martin Shkreli, a former pharmaceutical executive convicted of securities fraud; U.S. Rep. Majorie Taylor-Greene, who is known for embracing conspiracy theories; and the right-wing social media troll who goes by the nom-de-Tweet Catturd. For a former cable television star seeking to insinuate himself once more into the national conversation, Carlson was thwarted on Thursday by two current presidents and one former. News of President Biden, accused of memory lapses by a special prosecutor, overshadowed Carlson\'s video drop. The Russian president\'s tendentious historical claims overtook the interview. And, of course, there was Trump, whose ability to appear on Colorado\'s ballot dominated a historic Supreme Court argument earlier in the day.

A few senators on both sides of the aisle told KOCO they doubt a bill like this would make it out of committee or get a vote on the Senate floor. Most anti-abortion lawmakers at the state Capitol argued that focus should be put on those who provide or facilitate the abortion, not those who receive it. During Stitt\'s State of the State Address, the governor also called for the consolidation of state colleges. So far, there hasn\'t been word of any bill that looks to reduce the number of colleges in the state. But the governor explained his reasoning for what he said in the address. ""Let’s be smart. If I got a junior college that’s 40 minutes from another junior college, that may have made sense when we set them up in 1907. That doesn’t make sense anymore,"" Stitt said. Leaders in the House and Senate said they are open to consolidation as long as there is agreement that the schools being consolidated make logical sense and aren\'t picked at random.

There is no standard screening for stomach cancer, which would help detect it early. People with a higher risk for stomach cancer could benefit from an upper endoscopy, which is a procedure that looks inside the esophagus, stomach and duodenum (part of the small intestine) to check for abnormal areas, NCI says. The average age of stomach cancer diagnosis is 68, according to the American Cancer Society. Men are at higher risk than women of contracting the disease. Trending stories at Scrippsnews.com'}]"

no charges, and yet the words of the investigator hurt far more than they help. That is a scenario that appears to be playing out this week with special counsel Robert Hur deciding President Biden shouldn\'t be charged with willfully retaining classified documents, while also including language in his report about Biden\'s at-times-faulty memory, aggravating a preexisting political challenge for Biden. For people who were involved with Hillary Clinton\'s failed 2016 presidential campaign, the echoes of then-FBI Director James Comey\'s press conference on July 5, 2016, are hard to miss. He spoke for 12 minutes, describing Clinton as, among other things, ""extremely careless"" before getting to what he was there to announce. ""Our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,"" Comey said of the FBI\'s investigation into Clinton\'s use of a private email server while secretary of state. On its face, it looked like good news for Clinton, but Jennifer Palmieri, who was the campaign\'s communications director, said it was probably the single most damaging day of the campaign. ""The ad hominem attacks against her were ... brutal,"" Palmieri recalled. She said the campaign was blindsided by the Comey press conference and that ""irredeemable damage"" was done to Clinton\'s election bid. In his report, special counsel Hur said he didn\'t have the evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Biden willfully retained classified documents. But the nearly 400-page report didn\'t stop there. It also described apparent memory lapses during his interviews with the president. And it included a sentence that immediately ricocheted around the political world — that Biden comes across as ""a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."" Republican politicians immediately took to the airwaves to question Biden\'s mental competency, citing Hur\'s report. It was a predictable reaction and one that allowed Biden\'s opponents to highlight what is perhaps his greatest political liability. Public polls show even before this political storm, more than three-quarters of voters were concerned about Biden\'s mental and physical health. Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman of New York said Hur\'s report has a lot in common with what Comey did in 2016. ""These are criminal investigators who have stepped out of the normal role of sticking with the facts in evidence and analyzing whether the elements of a crime are met,"" said Goldman, who is a former federal prosecutor and Biden ally. He said both Comey and Hur may have felt political pressure to prove their independence and not to seem like they were going easy on Democrats. ""Special counsel Hur went out of his way to editorialize and include extraneous information that was not relied upon or relevant to his ultimate charging decision,"" Goldman argued. This is a point the White House argued on Friday, with Vice President Harris going so far as to describe Hur\'s report as ""clearly politically motivated."" Hur hasn\'t weighed in on why he included that information. But when he was named he promised to conduct the probe ""with fair, impartial, and dispassionate judgment."" Going back to the case of 2016, the Justice Department inspector general later found that Comey violated long-standing department practice and protocol by going on at length about uncharged conduct. That\'s what Goldman said Hur did in this case as well. However, the special counsel regulations required Hur to explain his charging decisions in a report to the attorney general. It doesn\'t say anything about how thorough that report needs to be, but recent history indicates the report is written with the understanding that it is likely to be released to the public. Biden\'s team is working overtime to disqualify special counsel Hur, pointing out among other things that he served in the Trump administration and isn\'t a doctor and is not qualified to assess the president\'s mental acuity. They\'re also trying to prove to the public that Biden is fully capable and should be elected to serve another four years. It\'s a race to stop Hur from becoming the Comey of 2024. But the damage may already be done. ""I think this will have the same kind of impact"" as Comey in 2016, said Frank Luntz, a pollster who spent years working for Republicans. Luntz recently conducted a focus group with people who voted for Biden in 2020 but aren\'t sure they can do it again. ""And the age thing is the No. 1 concern, more than immigration, more than inflation,"" Luntz said. Luntz also said this report gives credibility to that worry, providing validation from someone who isn\'t a politician.
