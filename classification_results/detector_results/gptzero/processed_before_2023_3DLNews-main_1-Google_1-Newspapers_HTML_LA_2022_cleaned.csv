Liz Leger (left) is presented the plaque recognizing her as the 2021 Avoyellean of the Year from 2018 Avoyellean Allison Ravare-Augustine. Liz Leger (left) is presented. The award is presented annually by the Avoyelles Journal. In 2020 the newspaper broke with tradition and named all ""essential workers"" fighting the COVID pandemic as the Avoyellean of the Year. Police Juror Charles Jones was the 2019 recipient, being recognized for the many years of public service, first as a career U.S. Army officer, as an educator in the public schools and for his work in promoting civil rights in the parish prior to being elected to public office. {Avoyelles Sleeves Up Facebook photo} Regardless of one’s personal views on the COVID pandemic, an undisputed fact is that anti-COVID vaccines have saved many lives — worldwide, in the U.S., in Louisiana and in Avoyelles Parish. That being the case, it must also be undisputed that many people in this parish have received a potentially life-saving immunization due to the efforts of the 2021 Avoyellean of the Year: Liz Leger. When a few staff members from the local newspaper dropped by the new offices for the Avoyelles Sleeves Up Health Resources organization, she thought it was to discuss some ideas she had for continuing to encourage people to get vaccinated and take booster shots to protect themselves from the current COVID variant and whatever new variant may be lurking in the shadows waiting to launch a “sixth wave” of the two-year pandemic. In tow behind the newspaper reps was another group that included a few former Avoyelleans of the Year and other notable figures. When Liz saw former AoY recipient Theresa Thevenote holding what looked like a plaque, she laughingly said, “I smell a skunk.” While expressing her appreciation and total surprise at receiving the Avoyelles Journal’s annual honor, she quickly said the award “should go to the Avoyelles Sleeves Up team. They do all the hard work.” IMPROVE RURAL ACCESS Avoyelles Sleeves Up was Liz’s idea, born out of her realization that almost all attention at halting COVID-19 with the vaccines was focused on the large cities. Meanwhile, COVID was running rampant and unchecked in rural Louisiana. There was an obvious need to improve rural residents’ access to the potentially life-saving vaccine. She also realized that rural communities were more suspicious of government-sponsored medical programs and more politically opposed to many of the COVID restrictions that had been put in place. With attitude and access being two high hurdles to overcome, Leger and a small cadre of assistants began developing what has become a model for rural vaccination programs throughout the state. One of the group of well-wishers, Van Roy, said Liz was worthy of the honor because “of the courage it took for you to take the stance you did at the time you did.” Roy said she not only had the courage to take that stance, but the persistence and dedication to stick with the project to make it successful. Liz and her husband, Al, live on Johnson Road, outside of Marksville. They have lived in this area for 40 years. She said her 35 year as Department of Education Program for Children with Disabilities administrator for Region 6 and then for the entire state served her well because she still has contacts in other parishes that have helped the local program. She and other Avoyelles Sleeves Up workers are helping other rural parishes develop a similar outreach effort. She will be heavily involved in the upcoming Cenla Rural Vaccination Summit, to be held in Alexandria on March 10. NEIGHBORHOOD EVENTS The local grassroots program has received financial assistance with grants and has recently been allowed to have two nurses that will be conducting community vaccination clinics without the National Guard presence. Liz noted that she received comments from some communities expressing distrust of the military’s involvement in the vaccination program. She believes those reservations will be set aside with the nurse-led programs, which will be held from 10-5 p.m. on those days. Avoyelles Sleeves Up launched its community vaccination drive with the help of the National Guard and nine community teams in the parish — people in those communities that Liz said ""give us the \'boots on the ground\' to wage this fight. This brought the vaccine to the neighborhoods, rather than expecting those residents to travel to a few locations to receive the vaccine. Before that effort began, only 16 percent of Avoyelles Parish residents had been vaccinated. As of today, almost 50 percent of parish residents eligible to receive the vaccine are fully vaccinated. Over 50 percent of Avoyelleans have received at least one dose of an anti-COVID vaccine. While there has been improvement, the fight is still tough and far from over, Liz said. One major emphasis at this time is in the area of boosters. WHAT IS ‘FULLY VACCINATED’ The term “fully vaccinated” may have given many a false sense of security. Liz stresses the vaccine is proven to be safe and highly effective at preventing serious COVID infections. The vaccine has reduced the number of people going to the hospital and the number of COVID-related deaths. However, it is not an impenetrable shield against COVID — especially the Omicron variant. Still, she adds, it is better to have even just one dose of a vaccine than to be completely unprotected. There are some who have advocated doing away with the “fully vaccinated” term, arguing that being without a booster means they are not “fully vaccinated.” As of last week, about 6,000 of the almost 19,000 “fully vaccinated” individuals in Avoyelles Parish had received a booster shot — only 31.5 percent. While one member of the award group said that it is hoped that someday in the near future, Liz and the Avoyelles Sleeves Up organization will be able to focus their energy and talents on tackling other community health concerns because COVID will be defeated, Liz made it clear that there is still too much to do to protect the parish from a virus that keeps changing and coming back. With about half of the parish population completely unprotected and less than a third truly “fully vaccinated,” there is still too much opportunity for a new surge to sweep through the parish, sickening thousands, hospitalizing hundreds and killing dozens. Liz said she will continue to do everything she can to reduce those numbers. 105 N Main StMarksville, LA 71351(318) 253-9247 CONTACT US Avoyelles Today | Copyright © 2024'}]"

guard by a mishap in her own life and becomes the news, or at least a source of tabloid-worthy scandal and popular outrage, in Bruno Dumont’s “France.” Played by Lea Seydoux, France has an attractive onscreen presence, but she’s also known for getting out in the field, reporting on rebel uprisings in North Africa and the dangerous plight of African immigrants trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea in small boats. The film explores both France’s skill in slickly orchestrating news coverage and studio debates, and the ways in which her onscreen image doesn’t match her personal life. The drama relies on Seydoux to make France’s overwrought heartache convincing, but the quick spree of misfortunes she encounters feels contrived. The film opens with a press conference by the French president. As a well-known TV journalist, France gets the first question, and she puts him on the spot in a way that thrills social media. Dumont is interested in highlighting the way media figures frame such coverage for their own benefit, suggesting that TV news can easily become more about the personalities on screen than the substance of what they’re discussing. France also stages multiple camera shots with armed rebels in North Africa, generating footage to dramatize her own news report. Dumont’s point is more devastating when France interviews a woman whose husband is accused of a horrible crime. After the heart wrenching conversation, France turns to the camera and reenacts all of her questions — ignoring that the woman is still there — so they can splice closeups of her into the video segment. France is at the top of her profession and has become wealthy getting there. Her husband is a novelist, and they run in elite social circles. But privilege doesn’t keep France from running into a man on a scooter while dropping off her son at school. She genuinely takes responsibility for causing the collision and helping the victim and his family. But the event weighs on her conscience, and that leaves her unsettled on set. In Dumont’s treatment, it highlights how far removed the TV personalities are from people like the immigrants or farmers in war-torn North Africa. A recuperation retreat in a beautiful spot in the Alps only helps France so much, and even further complicates her life. She returns to the news channel, but her personal life is not back to normal. More misfortunes set her careening from mishap to crisis, exposing fragility in her life offscreen. Seydoux is building on a prolific international career, appearing frequently in French cinema and also starring in Wes Anderson’s “The French Dispatch,” the latest Bond film, “No Time to Die,” and other big Hollywood films. Dumont repeatedly zooms in to closeups of France’s face, and Seydoux finds a grimace or look of despair for each occasion. Blanche Gardin is entertaining as France’s devoted and maneuvering agent. The film is steeped in an affection for journalism. The film is steeped in an affection for journalism. Dumont is effective in skewering cable news, though France actually covers news and is not just a talking head or a political hack. No one can predict what chance will bring them in life, not even celebrities accustomed to smiling for the cameras, but the film relies on a few too many random events to advance the story. What Dumont critiques in the systemic churn of the media industry is different from the unpredictability of France’s personal life, where the hardships are personal and immediate, and her handle on them isn’t as steady. “France” opens Friday, Jan. 14, at Zeitgeist Theatre & Lounge.

DELCAMBRE — People from the town of Delcambre said their goodbyes this past week to the biggest fan of Delcambre High School. That honor belonged to Brittney Jaide Migues, 37, who died after a short illness. Known as “BJ” to the town of Delcambre, Migues spent most of her life in a wheelchair. She was diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy at the age of one. But that never slowed her down. Her mom, Sandy, remembers Brittney telling her in grade school that she was not handicap. She “just could not walk.” That is how she treated her life. She never let the wheelchair slow her down. With the help of her parents, Sandy and Benny, Brittney was at every Delcambre sporting event. At the football games, her family sat west of the stadium near the scoreboard. At basketball games, she sat to the right when you walked onto the court. She wore her orange and black proudly. For baseball and softball games, she helped keep the scorebook. This past Friday, the Migues family attended a Delcambre football game for the first time without Brittney. They had just buried their daughter that Tuesday. Despite the pain, they attended and were overwhelmed with what had taken place. A group of seniors set up an orange chair with the balloons “B” and “J” tied where Brittney would generally sit for football games. Before the game, a line of DHS senior football player, managers and cheerleaders stood in a straight line and walked up the chair and placed an orange rose on the chair. In honor of their most loyal fan, a white cross with the initials “BJ” was painted in the end zone. “It was awesome,” said Sandy on Sunday night. “We sat and watched as everyone dropped a rose. It was beautiful.” Delcambre head football coach Artie Liuzza was proud of DHS for honoring Brittney. “I thought it was incredible,” said Liuzza. “This is what the Delcambre community is all about. I am proud of the kids and the community.” Delcambre Principal Chantel Helms said the DHS students thought of Brittney as a “big sister.” “I really do not think the student athletes thought of her as a classmate,” said Helms. “I think they thought of her as a big sister. One that was always there to support her little brothers and sisters at every sports event.” Helms said Brittney did not mind stating what the coaches should be calling or what skill the players were lacking or what position they should be playing. “We all took that with love, the same love that she had for the Delcambre Panthers,” said Helms. For the funeral, Delcambre students wore orange shirts and lined the sidewalk and inside the church as Brittney and her family made their way to the front of the church. She was buried in an orange t-shirt with the number 70528 (the town of Delcambre’s zip code) on the chest. Sandy said the Delcambre community, including the school, have been overwhelming with support. Brittney did not let a wheelchair slow her down. She loved going to concerts, the beach, and other sporting events and eating out with friends and family. Before she passed away, the school had planned to name Brittney the grand marshal of the homecoming parade. Despite her death, the school will honor Brittney as the grand marshal, with a float that will be filled with family members. This Tuesday will mark the first week of Brittney’s funeral. During that time, the Migues family realizes how much Brittney did and how much she was a massive part of the family. She helped pay the family bills online and organized trips and events. They just spent their first painful week without the daughter. “It has been empty,” said her mom. “We are lost. She did everything for us.” Looking back, Brittney was not expected to live past 10 years old after being diagnosed with Werdnig Hoffman Disease, a type of Muscular Dystrophy. But, somehow, she beat the odds and lived life to its fullest for 37 years. The Migues dedicated their life to raising their only child. And based on the support the community of Delcambre paid homage to her, it looks like they did a great job. Now seven days after burying her, the Migues realize that Brittney made their life complete. “Without her, our lives may not have been complete. She made our lives through her life. We are going to miss her so much.” 318 N.

the Courtney Coco homicide trial broke for the weekend after hearing testimony Friday from Coco\'s sister, a man who placed defendant David Anthony Burns at the site where her body was found and a woman who said Burns drunkenly told her about Coco being choked. Burns faces a second-degree murder charge and would be sentenced to life in prison if found guilty by a Rapides Parish jury. The body of Coco, 19, was found in a Winnie, Texas, building on Oct. 4, 2004. The case went cold, and it wasn\'t until April 13, 2021, that Burns was indicted and arrested. The state alleges he killed her during a robbery. Jude Wilson, a graphic designer from Texas, was on the stand most of the morning. He testified that he had been on an errand to buy cigarettes for his now ex-wife when he had to swerve to avoid a car backing out of the property where Coco\'s body later was found. He said he traveled that road ""all the time"" because he lived not far off it. Wilson said he went to the Chambers County Sheriff\'s Office with his information after the discovery of Coco\'s body and information about her missing car, including its license plate number, hit the news. Under questioning from Rapides Parish Assistant District Attorney Hugo Holland, Wilson said when he topped the road on an overpass over Interstate 10, he saw a car at the building, which he described as an abandoned concrete house painted white. He said he saw someone walk in front of the headlights and get inside, but that there was no light inside the car. The driver began backing out, but never stopped. Wilson said he was paying attention because he was afraid the driver would hit him. It was a close call, he said. ""I had to swerve out of the way,"" he said. Wilson testified the car was dark and boxy with a Louisiana license plate. He was able to get part of the license plate number because it contained his initials, he said, and he told Holland he remembered the number eight. The license plate on Coco\'s Pontiac was JUW 468. He testified that he tried to follow the car, but the driver already had made it to I-10 by the time he got turned around. He said the driver was traveling fast, estimating about 80 or 90 mph, in the direction of Houston. First day of testimony:State\'s first witness says David Burns told him he smothered Courtney Coco with a pillow Detective:David Burns told 5 people he killed Courtney Coco Wilson said the man had really short hair, so short he initially thought he was bald, and was younger. He said he didn\'t see the man\'s whole face, but only a profile. Years later, when the Alexandria Police Department assigned a new detective to the case, Wilson testified he drew a profile of the driver. He later picked Burns out of a six-person lineup presented to him by the detective. When Holland asked him, he pointed to Burns sitting at the defense table as the man he had identified. But while Wilson knew the near-wreck had happened during the Texas Rice Festival, he wasn\'t able to recall the exact date. He testified he was not good at remembering dates. Burns\' defense attorney, Christopher LaCour, questioned Wilson on that at length. LaCour asked Wilson if he\'d given three statements to law enforcement in the years since Coco\'s death, and he said yes. He told Wilson he never had mentioned in any of his statements remembering the number eight from the license plate. Wilson replied he did tell that to Chambers County, but that it wasn\'t included in the statement he signed. LaCour then asked Wilson if he noticed the perjury notice at the bottom of the statement he signed, and Wilson said he guessed he trusted the investigators more than he should have. LaCour hit him on several other details, which Wilson said also were not included in his statement. That led LaCour to ask Wilson if he realized Burns\' life was on the line during the trial and to ask him if he was playing games. Holland objected, calling the last statement ""wildly inappropriate."" LaCour withdrew it. LaCour questioned Wilson extensively on the dates of the Texas Rice Festival, which he and another witness said was happening at the time of the near accident, and on how he could identify Burns by only seeing his profile. Holland had previously said Wilson had a photographic memory, and LaCour called that into question because of his inability to remember dates. Wilson said he had a photographic memory when drawing. When Holland had a chance to question Wilson again after LaCour, he asked him what mistake he had made after giving his initial statement in Chambers County. Wilson replied that he\'d signed the document without reading it first. Holland also asked Wilson if he was trying to deceive law enforcement or the jury. ""No, why would I? I\'m not gaining anything,"" Wilson said. Holland asked him if he understood the significance of his testimony to Burns. He said yes, and he believed people are entitled to a fair trial. Holland then asked if that changed any of his testimony, and Wilson said no. The other Texas resident, Janet Veyon, testified that she had known Wilson since elementary school and that he was a gifted artist who always won school contests. She said she and her husband had been in a truck with a trailer that also was almost hit by the car that Wilson swerved to avoid. Unlike Wilson, Veyon testified she knew the incident had happened on the last night of the rice festival. Holland asked her how she knew. She said she is the chair of the Texas Livestock Show that happens in conjunction with the festival. She said they provide a trailer for some people who need help transporting their animals, and that those animals don\'t leave until the last day of the festival. She described a car that ""shot out"" between her truck and another car. She found out it was Wilson when he came to the sheriff\'s office, where she worked at the time, to give his statement. After the lunch break, a hearing was held on what information from LSU math professor Charles Delzell should be shared with the jury. After 9th Judicial District Court Judge Mary Lauve Doggett narrowed it down, Holland asked Delzell about the probability of someone correctly naming two letters of a license plate without having knowledge of it beforehand. Delzell said it would be less than 1%, but LaCour later asked him what he would say if the person had seen the information before being asked. Delzell said that would invalidate the findings and said his experiment had assumed the guesser had no prior knowledge. Coco\'s older sister, Lace Evans, testified next. She said she and her sister both worked at the same dental office in Alexandria, but Coco had quit two days before her death. Holland asked her how she remembered the events of the weekend her sister died. Evans said one of her fish had given birth, and she was removing them from her aquarium so the other fish wouldn\'t eat them.
