The state Department of Environmental Conservation in an initial incident report said the operator, Harvest Alaska LLC, indicated the maximum amount that could have leaked is around 11,550 gallons, or 275 barrels. Harvest Alaska is a subsidiary of Harvest Midstream, which is an affiliate of Hilcorp Energy. The state agency’s on-scene coordinator directed questions to Harvest Alaska spokesperson Justin Furnace, who released a statement from Andrew Limmer, regional vice president of Harvest Alaska. Limmer said the leak was discovered Saturday evening, and the company took “immediate action by shutting down the pipeline and promptly notified the relevant federal and state agencies.” Limmer said cleanup operations have begun. The Point Thomson field produces natural gas liquids. The cause of the leak is under investigation. The pipeline was immediately shut in and depressurized after the leak alarm notification, which prevented any remaining condensate from leaving the pipeline, according to the Department of Environmental Conservation. The incident on the North Slope happened about 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Prudhoe Bay. KWHL is a part of Alpha Media LLC.© 2024 Alpha Media LLC. All Rights Reserved.'}]"

""The court finds that there is a clear risk that Israel\'s F-35 fighter jets might be used in the commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law,"" the court said on Monday. The Dutch affiliate of the international humanitarian group Oxfam, along with two other nongovernmental human rights groups that sued the government in December, welcomed the decision. ""This positive ruling by the judge is very good news, especially for civilians in Gaza,"" Oxfam said in a statement. ""It is an important step to force the Dutch government to adhere to international law."" Israel denies it is violating international law, saying it is fighting in Gaza to crush Hamas and secure the release of hostages after the Palestinian militant group\'s deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel. But the court said, ""Israel\'s attacks on Gaza have resulted in a disproportionate number of civilian casualties, including thousands of children."" It ordered the Dutch government to enforce the decision within seven days and said the state has eight weeks to appeal the decision. The government says it will implement the decision but that it\'s lodging an appeal to the Dutch Supreme Court. ""In the government\'s view, the distribution of American F-35 parts is not unlawful,"" the government said in a statement. It said the court failed to take into account the state\'s role in determining foreign policy. The Israel division of Lockheed Martin, maker of the F-35, said it is evaluating what impact the court decision could have on its supply chain, The Times of Israel reported. The United Kingdom faces a similar suit, brought by two human rights groups, trying to prevent weapons exports to Israel. The court announced its decision as Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is on a trip to Israel to discuss the conflict with Israeli and Palestinian Authority leaders. The news followed a night in which Israel carried out airstrikes in the Gaza Strip that killed at least 50 people, according to health officials in the territory. The Israeli military said on Monday its special forces rescued two hostages held there. Israel\'s bombardment has killed more than 28,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry there. It launched the military campaign after Hamas\' Oct. 7 attack killed 1,200 people and took some 240 people hostage, according to Israeli officials.

encourage all eligible residents to own firearms and ammunition. District 7 Assemblymember Bernier cosponsored the resolution with Assemblymember McKee. Some residents expressed concern at the Assembly meeting, particularly how the resolution would increase safety. Bernier says the resolution is meant to help deter crime throughout the Borough, with a focus on the rural communities. At a public meeting in the summer of 2023 in Trapper Creek, Alaska Department of Public Safety Commissioner Cockrell explained that funding was not the cause for lack of Trooper presence. Cockrell explained that the Department had trouble recruiting talent, despite offering a significant sign-on bonus. At that time, 11 Trooper positions in the B Detachment remained open. Troopers at that meeting noted that there may only be five officers on duty to cover all of B Detachment, an area slightly larger than the state of Arkansas. A lack of Troopers in the Upper Valley has meant a perception of the increase in crime. Residents have become frustrated at the delay in response or lack of response altogether. Bernier says the lack of Trooper presence is not the main driver of the resolution, but that the US and Alaska state constitutions support gun rights. He goes on to say that even if there were plenty of Troopers in the Upper Valley, he would still encourage residents to be armed. Commissioner Cockrell says by email that the Mat-Su Borough has the ability to fund their own police force if they believe there is not adequate police presence within the Borough. He goes on to say that though there are fewer Troopers working today than they would like, there has been no meaningful reduction in Trooper response to calls for help or impact to the Alaskans they work for. Representative Kevin McCabe is supportive of the idea since he hears from many constituents about the lack of law enforcement in the district. However, he says he would rather see legislation creating a Reserve Trooper program or adding Village Public Safety Officer support in some of the underserved communities, such as Trapper Creek. Bernier says there are several other communities in the U.S. with laws on the books requiring or encouraging residents to be armed. He encourages Borough residents to take advantage of safety courses and firearms training. “The first defense is going to be yourself,” says Bernier. The resolution encouraging residents to arm themselves passed with no opposition. Your email address will not be published.

The state Department of Transportation has asked a state board that evaluates airports for funds to replace parts of the runway and some of the airport’s light fixtures. Petersburg’s Borough Assembly voted to support that initiative at their regular meeting this week. James A. Johnson Airport is a major transportation hub for Petersburg, which is on an island with no roads in or out. The airport receives a significant amount of the community’s passengers and mail. But parts of its runway and blast pad are sinking into the surrounding muskeg, and some of its critical light fixtures are waterlogged, or falling into general disrepair. That’s according to the Alaska Department of Transportation, which has proposed to rehabilitate the airport. Petersburg Borough Manager Steve Giesbrecht said that the need for repairs wasn’t even remotely on the Borough’s radar. He said the airport isn’t in any immediate danger of falling apart. But fixing problems now is an opportunity to keep the airport — and especially the runway — up to Federal Aviation Administration specs. “This came out of the blue for us,” said Giesbrecht. “The Department of Transportation Airport Group said, ‘Hey, your project made the list and we want a letter of support.’ It sounds like this is preventative maintenance and improving some things that need to be worked on.” There’s no price tag on the repairs yet. But Giesbrecht said he’s confident that state and federal entities will foot the bill. “I don’t have the dollar amount, but this is funded through [the] FAA,” said Giesbrecht. “Petersburg airport is considered an FAA facility. Basically, the state will do the work, and FAA will fund it. This does not involve any funding from the borough.” The state is looking at re-paving the runway and taxiway, as well as the aviation expansion area, which is almost two decades old. They also want to replace or repair the airport’s runway and taxiway lights, along with nine of its flood light poles. Petersburg assembly members responded to the idea with enthusiasm… “This is the FAA being proactive on our local airport, and I’m glad for their support,” said Assembly Member Jeigh Stanton Gregor. …And with jokes at the expense of Petersburg’s existing airport facilities. “[There] must be a mistake here, because I don’t see an item for a new terminal with a cute little bar and restaurant in it,” said Assembly Member Thomas Fine-Walsh. “Send it back!” “…Or a new seaplane facility!” added Assembly Member Scott Newman, as the entire chamber burst out with laughter. The assembly’s resolution to support the state’s proposal to rehabilitate Petersburg’s airport passed unanimously. The state’s transportation department will bring their funding request — along with Petersburg’s letter of support — to the Airport Project Evaluation Board at their meeting this month.
