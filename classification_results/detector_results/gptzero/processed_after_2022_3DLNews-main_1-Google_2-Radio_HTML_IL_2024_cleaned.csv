It’s Friday, I’ve got classical music on the radio and I’m looking forward to a weekend of doing as little as possible. Here’s what you need to know today. Mayor Brandon Johnson vowed to pull the plug on the controversial gunshot detection system at the end of the summer — and after the city hosts the Democratic National Convention. But the city’s $49 million contract with ShotSpotter expires at the end of today. Johnson yesterday repeatedly refused to answer questions about whether he will secure a deal to keep the system until September, giving the Police Department more time to adjust, my colleagues Tom Schuba and Fran Spielman report. Progressives and police reform advocates have long called for getting rid of ShotSpotter, pointing to reports questioning the technology. Most recently, a review by Cook County prosecutors found ShotSpotter had a minimal effect on prosecuting gun violence cases. But some council members have questioned such a move after the city reported 617 homicides and more than 2,400 shootings last year. [Chicago Sun-Times] In the second year of his presidency, Donald Trump’s staff considered transporting migrants from the U.S. border with Mexico to his political enemies’ Democratic strongholds, including the district of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But the idea really began to take on steam in conservative circles in 2021, when then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., floated similar suggestions, my colleagues Frank Main and Tina Sfondeles report. The two journalists spoke with some key decision-makers in Illinois and Texas about the early months of Texas’s program to bus migrants to Chicago and other Democratic cities. And they found local officials, who were caught off guard when buses began arriving, were furious when the governor of Colorado and the mayor of El Paso, Texas — both Democrats — got in on the act. [Chicago Sun-Times] You still have time to make a decision. And you also now have this handy election guide from the Chicago Sun-Times and WBEZ. The guide features questionnaire answers from candidates running for Congress, the Illinois statehouse and Cook County state’s attorney. If you don’t know who’s running in your area, you can enter your address here (don’t use periods) and get a look at the candidates at the top of the ballot. It’s not an exhaustive list — circuit court judges and other down-ballot races and referenda may not be included. [Chicago Sun-Times] Speaking of the upcoming election, Democratic Party politics loom large over the fight for Cook County Circuit Court clerk. [WBEZ] Feeling squeezed by the economy, some Chicago residents are exploring the co-op lifestyle as an alternative pathway to homeownership, Chicago Sun-Times contributor Olivia Dimmer reports. Cooperative housing comes in different styles, but it’s generally defined as a group of people splitting the purchase of a home or multiunit building and sharing the common spaces, such as the kitchen and living room. Peter Reimer, their partner and baby currently live in Bowers house, part of the Chicago-based Qumbya Housing Cooperative network. Rooms range in price from $450 to $600 per month, depending on size. “I definitely wouldn’t be able to afford to live in a house as big or as nice in this area if it wasn’t for Bowers,” Reimer said. “Being near to public transit and the lake is really important to me, as is the community aspect. I get to live with other people who want to be a part of my life, my child’s life and that is so valuable to me.” [Chicago Sun-Times] Take that, New York City. Pequod’s, which is known for its deep-dish pizza, was ranked the best in a Yelp Elite survey of 100 pizzerias, my colleague Stefano Esposito reports. “You can’t truly say you have a favorite Chicago-style deep dish pizza if you haven’t been to Pequod’s,” wrote Eric W., a Yelp Elite user. Other Chicago pizzerias that made the list were Piece Brewery and Pizzeria (No. 17), Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Co. (No. 27), Spacca Napoli (No. 44), Calo Pizzeria Restaurant & Lounge (No. 91) and Coalfire (No. 98).

Israel’s government has not publicly discussed a timeline for a ground offensive on Rafah, where more than half the enclave’s 2.3 million Palestinians have sought refuge. Retired general Benny Gantz, part of Netanyahu’s three-member War Cabinet, represents an influential voice but not the final word on what might lie ahead. “If by Ramadan our hostages are not home, the fighting will continue to the Rafah area,” Gantz told a conference of Jewish American leaders. Ramadan, expected to begin March 10, is historically a tense time in the region. As cease-fire negotiations struggle after signs of progress in recent weeks, Netanyahu has called demands by Gaza’s ruling Hamas militant group “delusional.” The United States, Israel’s top ally, says it still hopes to broker a cease-fire and hostage-release agreement, and envisions a wider resolution of the war sparked by Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel. The U.S. also says it will veto another draft U.N. resolution calling for a cease-fire, with its U.N. ambassador warning against measures that could jeopardize “the opportunity for an enduring resolution of hostilities.” But Netanyahu opposes Palestinian statehood, which the U.S. calls a key element in a broader vision for normalization of relations between Israel and regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia. His Cabinet adopted a declaration Sunday saying Israel “categorically rejects international edicts on a permanent arrangement with the Palestinians” and opposes any unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. The international community overwhelmingly supports an independent Palestinian state as part of a future peace agreement. Netanyahu’s government is filled with hard-liners who oppose Palestinian independence. Netanyahu wants Israel to achieve “total victory” over Hamas. In response to international concern over a Rafah offensive, he has said Palestinian civilians will be evacuated. Where they will go in largely devastated Gaza is not clear. The suggested timing for the offensive came as the World Health Organization chief said southern Gaza’s main medical center, Nasser Hospital, “is not functional anymore” after Israeli forces raided it in Khan Younis last week. Israeli strikes across Gaza continued, killing at least 18 people overnight into Sunday, according to medics and witnesses. A strike in Rafah killed six people, including a woman and three children, and another killed five in Khan Younis, the main target of the southern Gaza offensive in recent weeks. Associated Press journalists saw the bodies. “All those who were martyred were those whom the Jews asked to move to safe places,” said a bystander after the Rafah strike, Ahmad Abu Rezeq. In Gaza City, which suffered widespread destruction early in the war, an airstrike flattened a home, killing seven people, including three women, according to relative Sayed al-Afifi. Israel’s military rarely comments on individual strikes and blames civilian casualties on Hamas because the militants operate in dense residential areas. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a WHO team was not allowed to enter Nasser Hospital on Friday or Saturday. In a post on X, he said about 200 patients remain, including 20 who need urgent referrals elsewhere. Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said at least 200 militants surrendered at the hospital. He also claimed that Hamas in Khan Younis is defeated, and that Hamas is largely leaderless in Gaza. He gave no evidence to support the claims. The Gaza Health Ministry said 70 medical personnel were among those arrested, along with patients, leaving 150 patients without medical care. It said Israel refused to allow patients, including newborns, to be evacuated to other hospitals. The military says it is looking for the remains of hostages inside Nasser Hospital and does not target doctors or patients. The Oct. 7 attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 hostage. Militants still hold around 130 hostages, a fourth of them believed to be dead. Most of the others were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November. The war has killed at least 28,985 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. On Sunday it said 127 bodies were brought to hospitals in the past 24 hours. Around 80% of Gaza’s population have been displaced, and a quarter face starvation. Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority, said 123 aid trucks entered Gaza through Israel’s Kerem Shalom border crossing Sunday and four trucks of cooking gas entered through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. That’s well below the 500 trucks entering daily before the war. In the occupied West Bank, a shootout erupted when Israeli forces went to arrest an armed suspect in the town of Tulkarem. The military said the suspect was killed, and a member of Israel’s paramilitary Border Police was severely wounded. It described the target of the raid as a senior militant. The Palestinian Health Ministry said two Palestinians were killed. The war in Gaza has threatened to ignite wider conflict in the region. The U.S. Central Command said it conducted five self-defense strikes Saturday against cruise missiles and drones in area of Yemen controlled by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebel group. Algeria, the Arab representative on the U.N. Security Council, has circulated a draft resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza, and rejecting the forced displacement of Palestinians. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the draft “will not be adopted” and runs counter to Washington’s efforts to end the fighting. The U.S. vetoed previous resolutions that had wide international support. The U.S., Qatar and Egypt have spent weeks trying to broker a cease-fire and hostage release, but Qatar said Saturday the talks “have not been progressing as expected.” Hamas has said it will not release all remaining hostages without Israel ending the war and withdrawing from Gaza. It also demands the release of hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, including top militants. ___ Lidman reported from Jerusalem and Chehayeb from Beirut. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Denmark, he knew it had to be electric. Janssen, like many other Europeans, is concerned about the environment, but he was also drawn to electric vehicles thanks to generous government subsidies for those willing to give up their gas-powered cars. An IT manager, Janssen needed a car to commute every day, while at the same time offering enough space to take the whole family on road trips. He and his family test drove a Tesla. They also looked at a Nissan and almost ended up with a Volvo. But they eventually settled on a seemingly unconventional choice: the Atto 3, a compact sports utility vehicle from Chinese automaker BYD. It was a decision, Janssen says, that came down largely to price. ""The offer from BYD was about 20% lower than the Volvo,"" Janssen recalls. The company also offered a number of other ""goodies"" such as free charging for two years. Until recently, most Europeans had never even heard of BYD, or other Chinese automakers such as Nio or Geely. China has long been a manufacturing hub for other companies, including in auto production, as well as a top global player in the manufacturing of batteries that power electric cars. But now, with the expertise acquired from all that manufacturing, China is pouring tens of billions of dollars into developing its own auto companies with hefty subsidies and tax breaks. What\'s stunned observers is how quickly these Chinese companies have succeeded. Chinese EV makers started by selling EVs in their own country and became so dominant, they\'ve edged out foreign rivals. Now, they are aiming to go global, with big ambitions to become a top player overseas. ""China\'s auto industry has really fundamentally changed over the last 30 years, dating back to 1994 when [the government] issued its first auto sector industrial policy,"" says Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But it\'s really the electrification of the propulsion systems that has opened up an opportunity for the Chinese carmakers and changed the dynamics of the auto sector because China has invested in electrification far faster than everybody else."" Chinese automakers undercut foreign rivals in their home market, and focused on cheaper cars, giving them a critical advantage. But it did not all come down to just cost. Chinese consumers tend to be discerning, analysts say, so automakers quickly shored up their technology expertise while also focusing on design. ""Chinese customers are generally more styling focused and more technology focused. And I don\'t just mean like connecting your iPhone to the center screen,"" says Mark Wakefield of global consulting firm Alixpartners. ""I\'m talking things like assisted driving. So all of these things that help you keep the lane and help you drive semi-autonomous. The takeaway rate on those features is much higher China than it is in the U.S., for example."" Take BYD, which counts billionaire Warren Buffet as an investor. It started off as a battery manufacturer in the mid-1990s, before entering the auto sector in the early 2000s. Today, it has overtaken Tesla as the world\'s biggest seller of EVs, an astonishing accomplishment that reflects the breadth of China\'s ambitions to take over the world. It\'s not just BYD. Nio, for example, plans to expand to 25 countries and regions over the next several years. And other companies like Geely have global ambitions of their own. Nowhere have the battle lines been drawn more starkly than in Europe, where the push for a carbon-neutral transportation future has turned the continent into an ideal testing ground for those Chinese brands as they expand into Western markets. European Union customs data shows that Chinese EV shipments to Europe have increased by 361% from 2021. And while European car buyers remain somewhat wary of Chinese brands, their competitive prices have allowed them to gain market share. With sales of more than 12,000 units last year, the Atto 3 was not only BYD\'s top seller but also the best-selling electric compact SUV in Europe. The MG4 hatchback, a model produced by Chinese-owned MG, was the second best-selling electric car in the U.K. during the first seven months of 2023, only trailing market leader Tesla. BYD and other Chinese companies have been so successful they are now threatening traditional carmakers like BMW or Volkswagen, which have dominated Europe\'s auto industry for decades but have been slower in transitioning towards an electric future. BYD and Chinese rivals like Nio have succeeded in Europe in large part by keeping their price below their rivals, sometimes with a price advantage of as much as 25%. It\'s a strategy similar to the one they employed at home. The Atto 3, the model purchased by Janssen and his family, sells for a starting price of 38,000 euros in Denmark, compared to Tesla\'s Model Y, which starts at 49,000 euros after the company led by Elon Musk cut prices last year. Although the Model Y is larger and more powerful than the Atto 3, the difference has been critical in persuading customers like Janssen. And there are signs that Chinese EVs are starting to overcome their biggest drawback: a perception of poor quality. While their quality might not be up to some of the legacy brands, today\'s cars from China are vastly improved, according to Wakefield. ""These are very advanced vehicles. They are not quite up to the quality standards that the U.S. and European vehicles are, but they\'ve come a long way and the difference is now pretty negligible,"" he says. European auto executives have been quick to ring the alarm bells. Speaking at a major auto convention in Munich last year where the number of Chinese brands on display has doubled compared to two years earlier, BMW CEO Oliver Zipse said that Chinese carmakers posed an ""imminent risk"" to Europe\'s auto industry. The rise of Chinese EV makers has also alarmed European governments and regulators. The European Commission launched an investigation into China\'s alleged unfair trade practices in September last year. At the heart of European concerns is the heavy subsidies that China\'s government has steered towards its auto industry. ""Global markets are now flooded with cheaper electric cars. And their price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies,"" Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in September. The probe, which could take up to 13 months, will determine whether the EU will impose additional tariffs on Chinese EV imports above the current 10% duty on the value of the car. Beijing pushed back against the investigation, calling it ""blatant protectionist behavior."" Some of the earlier momentum seen by Chinese EV makers in their home market, however, has slowed after China removed a subsidy for domestic consumers, hitting profits for automakers. But Chinese companies are determined to plough ahead with their expansions overseas. ""They\'ve really led the way. They\'ve gone really past that early adopter phase and they\'re into the mass market,"" says Wakefield. And even if Europe ends up putting more trade restrictions in place, the global auto industry is currently still too dependent on China for its batteries and the processing of raw materials inside of them. China controls a vast majority of the refining of materials that go into EV batteries. That means imposing additional tariffs on Chinese imports could risk retaliatory actions from Beijing, which in turn could lead to less affordable electric vehicles for everyone. The U.S. has long been concerned about the dependence on China for batteries and the potential threat from the country\'s automakers. Washington currently imposes hefty EV-related tariffs on China, including a Trump-era levy of 27.5% on imports of Chinese-made cars, including gas-powered ones. The U.S. is also trying to reduce China\'s role in the EV supply chain.

George Santos alleged in a lawsuit filed Saturday that late-night host Jimmy Kimmel deceived him into making videos on the Cameo app that were used to ridicule the disgraced New York Republican on the show. The lawsuit filed in U.S. district court for the southern district of New York names Kimmel, ABC and Walt Disney Co. as defendants. A Disney representative listed as a media contact for the Jimmy Kimmel Live! show didn’t immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment. Santos, who was expelled from the House of Representatives last year after being charged with multiple counts of fraud and stealing from donors, is suing over alleged copyright infringement, fraudulent inducement, breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Kimmel misrepresented himself to induce Santos to create personalized videos “capitalizing on and ridiculing” his “gregarious personality,” the lawsuit alleges. Through Cameo, Santos received requests from individuals and businesses seeking personalized video messages. Unbeknownst to Santos, Kimmel submitted at least 14 requests that used phony names and narratives, according to the complaint. Starting in December the videos were played on a segment, “ Will Santos Say It? ” the suit says. In one of the clips, Santos offers congratulations to the purported winner of a beef-eating contest, calling the feat of consuming 6 pounds (2.7 kilograms) of loose ground beef in under 30 minutes “amazing and impressive.” “Frankly, Kimmel’s fake requests were funny, but what he did was clear violation of copyright law,” Robert Fantone, an attorney for Santos, said in an email. Santos is seeking statutory damages totaling $750,000 for the five videos he created that were played on the show and various social media platforms. He also asks for other damages to be determined at trial. The ex-lawmaker faces a slew of criminal charges, including allegations that he defrauded campaign donors, lied to Congress about his wealth, received unemployment benefits while employed and used campaign contributions to pay for personal expenses like designer clothing. He also is alleged to have made unauthorized charges on credit cards belonging to some of his donors. Santos pleaded not guilty to a revised indictment in October. On Tuesday, Democrat Tom Suozzi won a special election for Santos’ former seat. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

First of all, Sammy Jo is a talented young woman from Joliet. She’s got a beautiful voice, and she’s a great guitar player. (Side note, I hope she’s also working on her own music and that we get to see more of her) The concert started off with some quieter balance, and then the band launched into one of her upbeat pop songs. Sorry I don’t know the name of it, but many other people did! It was fun to see kids running up to the stage, and more than a couple of moms too! More and more people started filtering up to the stage, and they sang and danced with the band the whole night. This brought me so much joy. Those kids were me at that age, and I love that they’re already learning the joy of live music. I myself got up and sang and danced to a few of the songs that I knew like Blank Space and Shake It Off. This is not the first time I’ve been surprised by enjoying a live musical performance that I was not especially excited about, but when the music is good, there’s no place I’d rather be.

New York State troopers were called by members of Card’s Army Reserve unit out of concern for his mental decline in July, as ABC News previously reported, after an incident the night prior with some of his fellow Reservists. Card was taken that day to an Army hospital at West Point before being transferred for further treatment at a civilian facility. He was released after 14 days. The body camera, obtained via a records request by ABC News’ affiliate WMTW, shows the moments before Card was taken in for treatment. “Our concern is he is going to hurt himself or someone else,” one Reservist told New York State troopers in July, standing in the parking lot outside the facility they were staying at near West Point, before Card would go for what would be two weeks of psychiatric evaluation and treatment. Though Card hadn’t explicitly threatened self-harm or harm to others, “He said he was going to ‘take care of it,'” one Reservist told the troopers, another chiming in that he was being “combative” toward the other men. Card had “never been like this,” the reservists said multiple times – and they weren’t sure whether the behavior and hearing voices had been triggered by his new hearing aids, or something else. The night prior, Card had wheeled on his longtime colleague while on a beer run and “he clenches his fist and comes at me… I’m like, ‘Woah’ and just kind of backed up… was trying to fight me… I was like, this is crazy… he’s like hearing voices, it’s like paranoia… it’s weird,” one reservist said. Card had lost so much weight in recent months that “his face is sagging, he took his shirt off at the pool and he’s like all skin and bones. I couldn’t believe how much weight he’s lost.” “I’ve known him for a decade,” the reservist said. “I’ve been in this unit for ten years, he’s never been like that…” Card was hearing voices that he had a “small d*ck” and that he was a pedophile, as ABC News has reported – to the point where he took a picture of his genitals and “showed the people at work,” the reservists told the troopers, adding, “His boss was like, ‘yo man, you can’t do that.'” “On its face, it’s obviously weird behavior but the more concerning part is that he was never like this,” another reservist said. “And he’s a gun nut too, he has a lot of guns,” one reservist said. “He spent 14 grand on a scope too so he’s like … I don’t know, I don’t know what he’s capable of, I’m not insinuating anything but – I’m just saying – he does have a ton of guns.” Three months later, Card would allegedly open fire at a bar and a bowling alley in Lewiston, Maine, in back-to-back shootings that rocked the city and ricocheted across the nation. The body camera footage from July shows troopers knocking on Card’s door, which he answers shirtless after some delay, his head shaved and wearing shorts with “Army” printed in yellow on one leg. Card wordlessly leaned an arm with a bicep tattoo against the door frame as troopers said they wanted to speak with him, asking that he put a shirt on. Card, with a slight eye roll, let them in. He pulled on a black shirt with “Army” across the chest, and sat on an unmade bed. A picture of the Statue of Liberty hung on the concrete wall above his head. Card said he understood the reason the police were called, because he “flipped out on someone” who “messed around with me and they’re cowards and ran away… I didn’t do anything wrong, I haven’t been physical with anyone.” According to the footage, Card said people have been “saying sh*t” behind his back – as ABC News previously reported, he thought people had been saying he’s a “pedophile,” and that when he confronts people, “they pretend like I’m hearing stuff,” and that “it’s happening everywhere.” “The staff here was concerned about you to the point that they have command directed you to talk with a counselor, okay?” One trooper asks, to which Card answered, “Alright.” When asked if he’s willing to go for evaluation, Card shrugged, and said, “I have to if it’s command directed, obviously. But, is it going to help anything? No…” adding, he would “rather have people stop talking and stop looking at me, I’m a f**ing private person.” “I can absolutely understand that,” one trooper responded. Attempting to remind Card that his fellow Reservists were, until recently, his friends, Card responded “I don’t have any real good friends, obviously.” “I hope you understand that they’re concerned enough about your welfare that they called us,” one trooper said. Card responded riled up, “Oh, because they’re scared … ’cause I’m going to, friggin, do something. Because I am capable!” he said while rubbing his hands together. “What do you mean by that?” The trooper asks. “Huh?” Card responds, the trooper asking again – “What do you mean by that?” Card answered, “Nothing.” The newly released footage comes just as the independent commission investigating what led up to the Oct. 25, 2023 mass shooting is kicking into high gear. This week, the commission has officially been granted subpoena power for its probe, which will allow the commission to compel documents and witness testimony from individuals and entities who would otherwise opt not to cooperate. Importantly, this power will include seeking compliance in any state, federal or military court or tribunal – relevant here, given the investigation involves not only Maine authorities but also New York, New Hampshire – and the US military, whose inspector general has launched a separate investigation into the Army’s role into what led up to the shootings. The commission told ABC News they have received a response from the Army that they will allow some of their personnel to testify. That response comes after months where the commission has said there have been attempts to work with the Army, but as of late January, they had run into some “issues” with the Army, their executive director told lawmakers in lobbying for subpoena power. “Commission members have always said that they hope and expect people will cooperate with this independent investigation and having the power to subpoena should only be necessary in circumstances where the investigation could be delayed or impeded without it,” a spokesperson for the commission told ABC News, adding they’re “pleased that the Army has agreed to make individuals available” so that it “can continue its important work gathering the facts and evidence it feels it needs to help provide answers for victims, their families, and the people of Maine.” The Army has been invited to testify before the commission on March 7.

penal colony Friday. Many allies of the activist, world leaders and Kremlin watchers are blaming the Russian government for his death. A Kremlin spokesman vehemently denied those accusations. Still, Navalny is far from the only Kremlin critic to die in suspicious circumstances. NPR's international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam is here to talk to us about the fate of others who dared cross Russian President Vladimir Putin. Hi, Jackie. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Hi, Camila. DOMONOSKE: First of all, why do many think there's something suspicious about Navalny's death? NORTHAM: Well, he appeared in court Thursday, the day before he died, and by all accounts, appeared healthy and in good spirits. And Navalny even managed to send a Valentine's wish to his wife. Less than 24 hours later, he collapses and dies. And the thing is, Navalny had been poisoned before while on a flight from Siberia to Moscow a few years ago with a nerve agent called Novichok. He survived. But, you know, clearly Navalny was a target of the Russian government. He was a fierce and outspoken critic of Putin. And other people who have challenged the Russian president over the years have paid for it, you know, whether it being shot or poisoned or dying in a suspicious plane crash or even falling to their death out of a window. DOMONOSKE: Right. And Navalny certainly would have seen what happened with those other Putin critics over the years. Can you tell us more about them? NORTHAM: You know, there are some incidents straight out of a spy novel. For example, Sergei Skripal. He was an ex-Russian spy who was convicted of working for British intelligence. And he and his daughter were found collapsed on a bench in the U.K. after being injected with Novichok. Another spy who ran afoul of Putin, Alexander Litvinenko, died from a radioactive substance called polonium, and that was after having tea with two Russian agents in London. Boris Nemtsov, an opposition figure, he was shot, as well as investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya. An oil tycoon named Ravil Maganov, who called for the end to the invasion of Ukraine, he fell to his death from a sixth-floor window of a Moscow hospital. And then last year, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who was the head of the Wagner mercenary group. He died when the plane he was flying in exploded in mid-air after it left Moscow. You know, that was shortly after Prigozhin spearheaded an uprising challenging Putin's handling of the Ukraine war. And, Camila, the list goes on and on. DOMONOSKE: Has the Russian government ever admitted to being behind these killings or even investigated them? NORTHAM: You know, I spoke with Nicole Bibbins Sedaca, and she's the executive vice president of Freedom House, which tracks the Kremlin and these types of incidents. And she said the Kremlin always blames these things on random accidents or something similar, and that there's never really been a serious investigation. You know, Sedaca says these types of killings are getting more brazen, and that they highlight two things about Putin. Here she is here. NICOLE BIBBINS SEDACA: One, that he is desperate to keep silent anyone who is going to challenge his power or unveil the corruption and the brutality that has characterized his regime. Second is just the brutality. You know, he has absolutely no limits to the extent that he will go to kill people. And I do believe he thinks that he will be unaccountable. NORTHAM: And, Camila, Sedaca says now may be the opportunity for the world to hold Putin and his regime accountable, but it's hard to say if that will happen. She also said Putin will likely hope Navalny's death will help silence any other critics, but that, you know, the Russian human rights community is extraordinarily courageous. And there could be others to step in to fill the void left by Navalny. DOMONOSKE: That's NPR's international affairs correspondent, Jackie Northam. Thank you, Jackie. NORTHAM: Thank you.
