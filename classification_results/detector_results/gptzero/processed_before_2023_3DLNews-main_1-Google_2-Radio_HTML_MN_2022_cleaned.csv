Babe was rescued in 2012 by her forever Dad after she was abandoned 3 different times. The moment Crisco saw her picture he fell in love. The bond was instant and the love they shared was unmatched. Babe loved to roll over and show her teeth for a good belly rub. She loved to chase tennis balls, share kisses with her Dad for treats and spend time with her people. Not a day went by where she didn’t show her love and she will be missed immensely. Thank you for keeping Babe’s memory alive.
