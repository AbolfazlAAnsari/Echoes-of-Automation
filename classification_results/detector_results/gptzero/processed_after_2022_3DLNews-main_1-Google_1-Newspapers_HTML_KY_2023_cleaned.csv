Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:21 pm Three people were sentenced in Floyd Circuit Court Nov. 16 in separate drug trafficking cases. Among those was Laken Leann Harris, 36, of North Ralph Road, Garrett, who was sentenced by Circuit Judge Johnny Ray Harris to serve a total of 12 years on a variety of charges, including first-offense trafficking in a controlled substance (carfentanil or fentanyl derivatives), first-degree trafficking in a controlled substance (greater than or equal to 2 grams of methamphetamine, first offense), first-degree trafficking in a controlled substance (less than 2 grams of methamphetamine, first offense), carrying a concealed deadly weapon, DUI and endangering the welfare of a minor. Laken Harris was previously charged in three cases with three counts of first degree trafficking in a controlled substance (methamphetamine), first degree possession of a controlled substance (methamphetamine), three counts of possession of marijuana, two counts of buy/possession of drug paraphernalia, carrying a concealed deadly weapon, endangering the welfare of a minor, importing heroin, first degree possession of a controlled substance unspecified, third degree possession of a controlled substance unspecified, careless driving, trafficking in a controlled substance (fentanyl), operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, no/expired Kentucky Registration Receipt, third degree possession of a controlled substance unspecified, failure to produce insurance card and first offense no insurance. Laken Harris’ attorney Ned Pillersdorf asked Judge Harris to consider that his client had been housed in the Floyd County Jail for 1,325 days and requested that the remainder of her sentence be probated. He said that on a 12-year sentence she was likely close to being eligible for parole. “She’s got to have a record,” said Pillersdorf. “Has anyone else spent 1,325 days in jail? She’s never been sentenced until today.” Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney Doug Adams argued that many with similar cases serve 50 percent of the time they receive before being granted parole. Also sentenced on Nov. 16 was Linda Mullins, 59, of McKinney Drive, Harold, who Judge Harris sentenced to five years probated for five years on charges of first-degree trafficking in a controlled substance (greater than or equal to 2 grams of methamphetamine, second offense), receiving stolen property (firearm) and being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. Pillersdorf, who also represented Mullins, requested her case be probated due to the time she served in jail. Judge Harris told Mullins during the hearing he was probating the sentence due to the “significant time spent in jail.” Judge Harris sentenced Jason R. Howell, 44, of Pleasant Run Road, West Liberty, to serve one year in prison on a charge of first-degree possession of a controlled substance (unspecified, first offense). Judge Harris ordered the sentence to run concurrently with a sentence Howell is already serving.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:29 pm Rack Room Shoes and Five Below are the latest additions to the Madisonville Town Center development. Those names were announced last night at a Hopkins County Regional Chamber of Commerce “Chamber After Hours” hosted at Madisonville City Hall. The retailer’s will join Aldi and Hobby Lobby in the $30 million retail development on Whittington Drive in Madisonville. “The Shopping Center Group told us right after we made the announcement at the site back a couple of months ago, that this project is the largest retail development in the commonwealth for the next two years,” said Mayor Kevin Cotton. “That is huge for Madisonville and the region as a whole.” While that makes a total of four stores currently under contract, according to Mike Wiles, a partner in Paducah-based Brewer, McCoy & Wiles Development, the company behind the project, they aren’t done yet. There is still around 30,000 square feet of retail space to be leased, and those names will all hopefully be announced over the next three to four months, including a ladies apparel store and a home goods stores. “One of them we will be able to announce before Christmas is one every lady in this room will know,” Wiles said. “The other one will probably be March.” There is also an additional 30,000 square feet that he hopes to have under contract by March. “This whole 175,000 square feet (shopping center), all but about 10,000 square feet of it will be new to Madisonville,” Wiles said. “This will be the second store for something that is at the mall, but they are going to keep the other store.” Madisonville Town Center, slated to open in the spring of 2025, is the second of at least three phases for the development. Phase one of the project, Aspen Dental and Starbucks, is currently under construction and slated to open in March of 2024 at the former Pizza Hut site. The third phase will be a national “sit down” restaurant, which will be located between the retail development and 5/3 Bank. That should open in the fall of 2025. A potential fourth phase could go in on the western edge of the property. The Marriot hotel chain has toured the location and is interested in locating a Fairfield Inn there, but Wiles said his company isn’t exactly sold on that idea. “We’re not hotel developers, we’re shopping center developers,” Wiles stated, although the company has not yet rules that idea out. “We’re not sure what we are going to do there.” Community calendar Submit event - More events Submit event - More events Sorry, there are no recent results for popular images.

(Photo by Gene Burch) Friday the 13th got off to an ominous start after a large rockslide in the area of Taylor Avenue prompted a large response from authorities and closed the road early Friday. ""I had a loud wake-up call this morning,"" explained local photographer Gene Burch, who lives on Crown Point. ""About 7 a.m., there was a huge rumble that sounded like thunder with falling rocks.""

A rockslide at the former rock quarry on Taylor Avenue early Friday morning forced the closure of the road. Police are also asking residents to avoid the Crown Point area.

Great view from up on top of that hill, but no way would I live on property that was just a few feet above an old quarry. Danger, Will Robinson!!! Danger indeed, its kind of like building your house on “sinking sand” except that its a lot slower moving and much larger chunks. When it cuts loose, it does so in spectacular fashion. Dr. Burch may be lucky that he didn’t take a ride down the hill in his bed/house. I have always heard that they couldn’t get property insurance up there, for good reason.

Sounds like Rocky and Bullwinkle’s Fractured Fairytales! Log In State-Journal.com’s comments forum is for civil, constructive dialogue about news topics in our community, state, nation and world. We emphasize “civil” at a time when Americans, in the words of the current president, need to “turn down the temperature” of political debates. The State Journal will do its part by more carefully policing this forum. Here are some rules that all commenters must agree to follow: Absolutely no attacks on other commenters, on guest columnists or on authors of letters to the editor. Our print and online opinion pages are sacred marketplaces of ideas where diverse viewpoints are welcome without fear of retribution. You may constructively critique the ideas and opinions of others, but name-calling, stereotyping and similar attacks are strictly prohibited. Leeway will be given for criticism of elected officials and other public figures, but civility is essential. If you focus your criticism on ideas, opinions and viewpoints, you will be less likely to run afoul of our commenting rules. Keep comments focused on the article or commentary in question. Don’t use an article about the Frankfort City Commission, for example, to rant about national politics. Hyperpartisanship that suggests anyone on the other side of an issue or anyone in a particular particular party is evil is not welcome. If you believe that all Democrats are socialists intent on destroying America or that all Republicans are racists, there are lots of places on the internet for you to espouse those views. State-Journal.com is not one. No sophomoric banter. This isn’t a third-grade classroom but rather a place for serious consumers of news to offer their reactions and opinions on news stories and published commentary. No consumer complaints about individual businesses. If you’ve had a bad experience with a private business or organization, contact the Better Business Bureau or the government agency that regulates that business. If you believe the actions of a private business are newsworthy, contact us at news@state-journal.com and we will consider whether news coverage is merited.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:13 pm WILLIAMSBURG — A Bell County woman is dead after her truck collided with a semi Tuesday morning on KY 92 East. The accident occurred shortly before 9:30 a.m. was investigated by Kentucky State Police Commercial Vehicle Enforcement. Upon arrival and through investigation, officers learned that a 2004 Ford pickup truck driven by 52-year-old Linda Bedford of Pineville, had crossed the centerline — colliding with a 2015 Kenworth tractor trailer operated by 57-year-old Clyde Norman of Pioneer, Tennessee. Drugs and alcohol are not suspected factors; Bedford was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash. She was pronounced deceased on the scene by the Whitley County Coroner’s office. KY 92 East was shut down for approximately four hours while officers investigated the crash just east of Whitley East Elementary School. Assisting on scene were CVE officers, Whitley County EMS, and Whitley County Coroner’s Office. CVE Officer Jason Freeman continues the investigation.

McConnell froze while speaking to reporters on Aug. 30, abruptly going silent while answering questions about running for reelection in 2026. A similar incident occurred on July 26, when McConnell froze during a press conference and was escorted from the lectern by colleagues. On Sept. 5, two letters addressed to McConnell from Brian Monahan, attending physician of the United States Congress, were made public. In the first letter, Monahan concludes that McConnell’s Aug. 30 episode was either an aftereffect from a concussion sustained in March 2023 or a symptom of dehydration. In the second letter, Monahan stated that there is no evidence McConnell has a movement or seizure disorder, or that he had a stroke. “I think Dr. Monahan covered the subject, fully,” McConnell said at the press conference. “You’ve had a chance to read it.

As McConnell’s health concerns are called into question, many members of the GOP have come to his defense. “We might lose Mitch McConnell 20 seconds a day, but the other 86,380 seconds are pretty darn good so I’m supporting him,” Sen.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:23 pm HUNTINGTON The first century of Tri-State radio icon WRVC AM 930 has come to a conclusion. On Oct. 16, 1923, Glen E. Chase first broadcast WSAZ on 1160 AM from Chase Electric Shop in Pomeroy, Ohio. While the call letters are different, it’s the longest continually operating station in West Virginia, and also the Tri-State’s first station. WAAR was actually the first radio station in Huntington but was short-lived. WSAZ began with only 50 watts, and its call letters were assigned by the U.S. Department of Commerce. In March 1927, it was purchased by WC McKellar and McKellar Electric Company, and its studio was moved to 1143 Fourth Ave. in downtown Huntington. Power was increased to 100 watts, and WSAZ switched to 1230 AM. That frequency many years later became the home Ironton’s historic WIRO. On Nov. 28, 1928, the Federal Radio Commission relocated WSAZ to 580 AM. It was then broadcasting from the Prichard Hotel. It was forced to share 580 AM with WOUB from Charleston, and the two stations had to divide broadcast hours. In July 1929, Huntington Publishing Company purchased WSAZ, and studios were moved to the third floor of the Keith Albee Theater at 927 Fourth Ave. On March 25, 1933, WSAZ moved from 580 AM to 1190 AM. Daytime power was raised to 1,000 watts and nighttime power was increased to 500 watts. In 1940, WSAZ installed a multi-directional tower system for two pattern operation. This enabled the station to go farther in certain directions where they wouldn’t interfere with other stations. On March 29, 1941, WSAZ had its last frequency change, going to 930 AM. In mid-1946, daytime power increased to 5,000 watts, and eventually nighttime power went to 1,000 watts. In the early days of radio at WSAZ, it wasn’t just records being played. Listeners could be treated to a concert from a live orchestra, or a children’s choir that would take over the studio. Local news as well as national news was important to broadcast. Sports, especially from Marshall University, was important. Talk shows, church broadcasts, comedy and radio drama theater were also part of the other programming. One early radio star was Ashland resident Venus Ramey, when WSAZ was Huntington’s only licensed station. Ramey was likely a WSAZ radio personality. However, at one point Ashland’s WCMI had a Huntington studio. Ramey became Miss America 1944. J.T. Norris, former publisher of the Ashland Daily Independent, was one of a few men who purchased WCMI in 1939. Radio historian Francis Nash, from Grayson, said WCMI was originally WMFP but changed its call letters to WCMI before going on the air on April 29, 1935. On Oct. 15, 1949, WSAZ-TV spun off of WSAZ and became West Virginia’s and the Tri-State’s first television station. Soon after moving to Huntington, WSAZ began broadcasting Marshall games. To this day, WRVC FM 93.7 is still the flagship station of Marshall sports. On Oct. 4, 1927, Marshall Athletic Director Roy “Legs” Hawley announced an agreement with W.O. McKellar to broadcast Marshall home football, basketball and baseball games. Five days later, Marshall played Concord College in football, in the first broadcast collegiate game with two teams from West Virginia. Marshall won, 18-16, and even at 1927’s low power was said to be picked up in Maine and Florida. WSAZ chief announcer Beckley Smith and former Marshall player Harold “Pat” Patterson called the game. Patterson eventually became WSAZ’s first sports director. Creatively, in 1933 a telegraph wire was leased for an away game at Miami (Ohio). A reporter relayed details of the game that came up on a grid board near the corner of Fifth Avenue and Tenth Street. Huntington Publishing Publisher H.R. Pinckard announced play-by-play accounts of the game over a public address system for a crowd of 2,000 on a roped-off Fifth Avenue. Gene Kelly, a former minor league pitcher, became a student and sports editor of Marshall’s newspaper, The Parthenon, in 1939. In 1940, he began helping with the broadcast of Marshall games on WSAZ. He was the lead announcer from 1940-42 before serving in World War II. He later became an announcer for the Philadelphia Phillies, and called Cincinnati Reds games with Waite Hoyt, and was an announcer for the NFL’s St. Louis Cardinals. Way before WSAZ-TV, Marshall home games would be filmed by some Thundering Herd fans and shown at theaters in other parts of the region. Some people filmed road games, and 10- to 15-minute highlight reels would be shown in Huntington theaters as an extra treat before feature films. In 1968, respected sportscaster Gene Morehouse came from Beckley, West Virginia, to be the voice of Marshall University football and basketball on WSAZ. In Beckley, Morehouse called games for Woodrow Wilson High School when future Marshall legend, Bobby Pruett, was a player. Sadly, Morehouse was one of the 75 passengers who were all killed in Marshall’s football team’s plane crash in 1970. His son, Keith Morehouse, longtime sports director at WSAZ-TV, spent time as the television voice of Marshall games. In 1991, Marshall formed The Thundering Herd Radio Network, which has had at least as many as 36 affiliated stations in one season. Stoner Broadcasting from Iowa purchased WSAZ on May 20, 1970, for $900,000 ($1.6 million in 2023 money). A 1970 newspaper article said the call letters would be changed to WHWV, but on June 1, 1970, Stoner Broadcasting changed that decision and altered the call letters to WGNT, which stood for Giant, and the slogan, “The Tri-State’s Friendly Giant,” was born. “As midnight shift deejay, I actually received QSL letters from (listeners) all over the eastern USA,” Paul Urbahns said. He had the distinction of being the last deejay to announce on WSAZ, and the first to announce on WGNT. Urbahns said that he signed the station off at midnight and, after a few hours of sleep, introduced his audience to WSAZ at 6 a.m. He said there were comedic signs up in the station reminding the announcers to say WGNT. Ashland resident Greg Willis said that while attending Western Kentucky University that he would listen to WSAZ and said, “It made me feel like I was at home.” A couple of Miller brothers from Ironton reigned the morning drive time period with what was called a middle of the road — or soft rock music, talk shows and a full-service format — in the 1970s. Their shows had seasoned news and sports reporters who kept listeners informed with local newscasts seven days a week. “The program director at WGNT was driving up U.S. 52 one night and heard me, and called me the next day, and hired me after that,” said Bob Miller, who was on his second tour of duty at WIRO that fateful night in 1970. Miller previously left WIRO to be a disc jockey at WAMX in Ashland. “It was an automated station. It got old really fast. Well, they (WAMX) paid me more.” In 1974, Miller was named Billboard Magazine Small Market DJ of the Year. At WGNT, the fun didn’t end when some stations signed off for the night. Ernie Anderson was a WGNT host from 1977-1980. From midnight until 3 a.m. he had a well-known trivia show. The show was so popular that Anderson would sometimes have on-air parties for his late-night trivia fans. Anderson can still be heard talking about trivia on his 2-6 p.m. show on Kool Hits 105.7. In 1988, WGNT’s call letters were changed to WRVC when local multiple McDonald’s franchise owner, Tom Wolf, purchased the station. In 1992, Huntington native Mike Kirtner came from Louisville and became a partner. They formed Kindred Communications, which currently has six radio stations in the Tri-State that all broadcast from Fifth Avenue in Huntington. In March, Wolf sold his interest in Kindred Communications to Kirtner, and Kirtner’s new partner is his son Reeves Kirtner. The call letters at 930 AM have been WRVC since 1988, except between part of 1991-1994 when they were WTKZ. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:34 pm A song often heard as Christmas approaches is that the holiday “is the most wonderful time of the year.” But for many, it’s a difficult time — especially for those grieving the loss of a loved one who won’t be at the family Christmas gathering this year. Of course there are other reasons for anxiety. All it takes is a look at the news stories each day and you quickly understand the perilous times of 2023. One of my favorite Christmas stories is worth revisiting. As bad as times may be today, it looked worse to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 160 years ago. The tragedies of his life inspired one of the favorite Christmas carols we still sing. Hopefully no matter what your situation is today, the story of his carol will encourage you. It was Christmas Day 1863 and the country was in the midst of a Civil War — a war he hated. His personal life had more than its share of troubled times when he composed the words to the popular Christmas carol “I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.” The carol was originally a poem titled “Christmas Bells.” The story behind Longfellow’s “poem turned carol” is one borne of his own sorrows. In 1861, Longfellow’s wife, Fannie Elizabeth, died tragically when her dress caught fire. Longfellow, waking from a nap, did his best to put out the flames — first with a rug and then his own body, but she had already suffered severe burns. She died the next morning (July 10, 1861), and Henry Longfellow’s facial burns were so severe that he was unable to attend her funeral. He grew a beard to hide his burned face — and at times feared that he would be sent to an asylum because of his grief. In March 1863, Charles Longfellow, the oldest of six children born to Henry and Fannie Elizabeth, joined the Union Army. He was 18, but hid his action from his family. When he tried to enlist as a private with the 1st Massachusetts Artillery, the battery commander wrote to Henry Longfellow, asking for written permission for his son to be a soldier. That request was granted. “Charley” impressed his fellow soldiers and superiors so much that he was soon granted a commission as a second lieutenant. However, within a few months Charley contracted typhoid fever and was sent home to recover. He rejoined his unit on Aug. 15, 1863, missing the Battle of Gettysburg. Longfellow was dining at home on Dec. 1, 1863, when he received a telegram saying his son had been severely wounded four days earlier. While involved in a skirmish during a battle of the Mine Run Campaign, Charley was shot through the left shoulder, with the bullet exiting under his right shoulder blade. It had traveled across his back and skimmed his spine. Charley avoided being paralyzed by less than an inch. The surgeon informed Longfellow that Charley’s wound “was very serious” and that “paralysis might ensue.” Three surgeons gave a more favorable report, suggesting a recovery that would require him to be “long in healing,” defined by “at least six months.” So on Christmas day, 1863, Longfellow — a 57-year-old widowed father of six children, the oldest nearly paralyzed as his country fought a war against itself — wrote a poem seeking to capture the turmoil in his own heart and the world around him. He heard the Christmas bells that December day and the singing of “peace on earth” (Luke 2:14), but he observed a world of injustice and violence that seemed to contradict this optimistic outlook. That’s what led to the saddest words in his poem, reflecting the misery of a man who felt no hope … And in despair I bowed my head;“There is no peace on earth,” I said; “For hate is strong and mocks the song Of peace on earth, goodwill to men!” In his crisis of belief, somehow the Christmas bells that morning reminded him of a deep truth, which resulted in the following stanza: Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: “God is not dead, nor doth He sleep; The wrong shall fail, the right prevail, With peace on earth, goodwill to men!” The cloud over Longfellow’s life began to lift when he made the decision to focus on the reality that God is alive, that He is sovereign and has a greater plan than we can understand. We agree with one writer who said, “We will never see the type of ‘peace on earth’ that so many long for. But we can experience peace in our hearts when we put our faith and trust in the God who created the universe … that’s the kind of peace Longfellow finally experienced.” For you, perhaps it’s not hearing church bells that remind you God is alive and is keenly aware of the struggles and challenges you face. But Scripture can serve that much needed purpose. On that December morning in 1863, Longfellow recognized that “God is not dead, nor doth He sleep.” That statement is just as true today as it was then. And that is why we can all gladly say, “Merry Christmas.” (This originally appeared on Kentucky Today, the online news website of the Kentucky Baptist Convention.)

Two Hall Properties received a variance for parking from the Bullitt County Board of Adjustments. Attorney Thomas Hamilton said the plan is to build a 2,600 square foot building off Highway 44 at Lloyd Lane. Part of the building will be the relocated Kenny’s Cleaners and the other would be a Bisbee’s Coffee franchise. Hamilton felt there would be enough parking for the businesses. The board approved the variance. In other action: *Scott and Heather Hibbard received a variance that would allow a detached garage to be built on Village Circle Drive. There was no opposition. *Pamela Holder received a conditional-use permit to operate a family cemetery off Hodges Lane in Brooks. She said the cemetery will be on her property and would be perpetually maintained. She didn’t know the number of gravesites on the property. There was no opposition. *Steven and Ramona Kareken received a conditional-use permit to allow a garage to be used for a short-term rental facility. He said the detached garage has been used for the residential rentals for the past five years. However, a recent complaint resulted in the need for the conditional-use. The two-bedroom apartment is rented for a five-day period and he said it is normally occupied 11 weeks per year. The owners are required to pay county lodging taxes. A couple of neighbors were concerned about the granting of the permit. Mark Williams said that there are deed restrictions which prohibit the requested use. He feared that if one was granted, others could follow in the agricultural community. County attorney Tammy Baker said that the planners do not regulate deed restrictions. Any challenge to that would be a private, civil matter. Rick Seay, another resident of Shultheise Lane, said that the lagoon is not big enough to handle the septic created by the house and the occupied garage.

With the ongoing construction on the Mountain Parkway, there have been numerous reports of people accidentally driving on the wrong side of the road in that section of the road. Please use caution in that area and watch for barrel placements and signage as roadwork continues. Jarrell’s funeral was held Monday from the Hall Funeral Home in Martin, Kentucky. He was the son of Belinda Click Jarrell and the late Duran Jarrell. Your email address will not be published.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:02 pm A steady flow of voters in Boyd, Carter and Greenup Counties hit the polls with the governor’s race on their minds on Tuesday. Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, faced off against Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Republican. Other commonwealth races included Secretary of State, Attorney General, Auditor of Public Accounts, State Treasurer and Commissioner of Agriculture. For an “off-year” election, poll workers reported that they saw a better-than-expected turnout in northeastern Kentucky. Boyd County’s Convention and Arts Center served all Boyd County precincts on Tuesday, which total nearly 40,000 registered voters. As of Tuesday afternoon, about 10 residents waited to cast their vote, with replacements filling in just as quickly as others left. One female voter said she had turned out for the governor’s race, adding her belief the highly contested race was the reason most had headed to the polls. However, a couple that had just arrived to the polling station said they vote in every election and didn’t show up for any significant race on the ballot. An employee of Chuck Wagon’s food truck, stationed at the parking lot of the convention center, reported they had been “pretty busy” throughout the day. Nancy Houston, 58, was among people casting their ballots at Crabbe Elementary. She said her involvement in politics began in the election of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. “Andy Beshear all the way, he is awesome,” Houston said. “I just started voting in 2016. I came here to make sure my vote counts. I feel like the ones I voted for are looking out for us.” Sandy Burke has been working the polls for 17 years. She said the polling location at Crabbe Elementary saw a spike in voters compared to the last election. Burke said, “It’s been steady all day. … I love political stuff.” Betty Phipps, 76, was still undecided as she walked into the polling location. She said breaking party lines is nothing new for her. “I have been voting for a long time; I am really kind of torn ‘cause I am Republican, but yet I like Andy Beshear. I voted for him before and I think he has done a good job. ... I vote for the person not for the party.” Ella Lewis, 18, is a first-time voter. She said she was excited to finally be able to have a say-so in politics. “I was very nervous, I just went with my heart,” Lewis said. “Voting today makes me feel as if I’m able to say my voice and create change in the community.” Stacy Carpenter was leaving the polling location at Poage Elementary and said Beshear is a driving force in what brought her out. “We feel pretty strong about supporting Andy Beshear because we are a family of teachers, and state workers, he has been really supportive of us and so we want to be really supportive of him. ... We always vote in every election, it is very important to us.” Vincent Fugeman was at Poage. He said people need to follow all elections and perform their civic duty, not just in the presidential race. I think it’s important that everyone pays attention to our statewide elections; oftentimes people focus on the national race and people really need to focus on what’s going on in the state. He said he “fell away from practicing voting,” but thanks to his mom, and a friend, he is voting again. “They lit a fire underneath me and they reinvigorated that,” he said. “It’s extremely important to me and it should be to everyone because that’s our opportunity to directly impact our world.” The polling location at the Catlettsburg Senior Citizens Center had a call of disturbance reported in the building. The Boyd County Sheriff’s Office and Catlettsburg Police responded to the call. A man had become frustrated after he left his absentee ballot at home and was wanting another ballot, a poll worker said. The officers helped the man out of the building and called a Safeway taxi to get home. Laura Neal was at the Catlettsburg polling location and expressed the importance of voting. “It’s very important for us to get out and vote and express our opinions,” she said. “It’s our right to do that.” Mark and Cecilia Lambert, at Charles Russell Elementary, said most of the time they cancel each other’s votes out but this time is different. “We normally would cancel each other’s votes,” Mark said. “I voted for Beshear. I just think he has done a good job. He had a rough four years.” Cecilia chimed in and said, “He has taken Kentucky through a lot of hard times and I think he deserves another four years.” Both the east and west side of Carter County experienced a steady stream of voters. The large majority of Carter residents expressed interest in the state’s gubernatorial race, while the other portion claimed they were only exercising their civic duty. All precincts combined, Carter County is home to roughly 20,000 registered voters, according to online state statistics. While the rotation of voters resembled more of a trickle over a constant pour, poll workers for various districts recorded a decent turnout as of the afternoon hours. One voter leaving East Carter Middle School, which serves as the polling destination for about 3,600 registered voters, said Tuesday served only as another election day. She said she has been voting since the age of 18, when the voter requirement age was changed from 21 in 1971. “They changed the voting age to 18 the year I turned 18,” she said. One 88-year-old voter gave thanks to a neighbor who volunteered her time to drive her to the polling station. The neighbor said it was her third trip of the day to the middle school, as she had shuttled other voters in order for them to exercise their right to vote. “I would’ve missed it if it weren’t for her,” the voter said. Inside, poll workers at the Oakland precinct (with a little more than 1,100 registered voters) reported about 200 of them had turned out with a little more than three hours before polls closed. Alpha Hall precinct’s poll workers said over half of their registered voters had turned in a ballot. Alpha Hall is designated to include 1,419 voters. One male voter who had just cast his in Grayson happily informed he turned in a vote in favor of Gov. Andy Beshear — his reasoning being that he appreciated and respected his honesty. “He doesn’t lie,” the voter said of Beshear, adding his vote for Beshear came down to the governor’s lineage of religion and morality. The man added opponent Cameron’s endorsement by Donald Trump told him all he needed to know. “I wouldn’t wanna be anywhere near (Trump),” he said, adding he believed while the ballot only included a state race, he saw it as representative for the preservation of democracy in the future presidential election. Across the county, West Carter Middle School served five county precincts encompassing a large portion of Olive Hill voters. However, poll workers stationed at Olive Hill Courthouse’s precinct said they were instructed by the Election Board not to talk with the press. According to 2023’s primary election Kentucky State Board of Elections Election Officers’ Training Guide, news media members may be present inside the polling station, so long as the media member (i.e. reporter) does not not conduct interviews with voters inside the voting room, record the identity of voters or disrupt the voting process. Outside West Middle, two men had opposing views on their selected candidate for governor, but agreed that’s what drove them both to the polls. With one voter voicing support for Beshear, he was countered by another who argued against Beshear “shutting the state down.” The voter opposed to Beshear said he cast his vote in favor of “competent representation.” The two concluded opinions were entitled to every person. At Tygart Creek Elementary, which includes precincts for the western most end of Carter County, also recorded a steady turnout of voters.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:13 pm WHITLEY COUNTY — The Whitley County Grand Jury has indicted the couple accused in the death of 4-year-old Chloe Darnell. Brittany Slaughter, 24, of Williamsburg, and Adam Hayes, 34, of Williamsburg, were indicted Monday on charges of Murder, Abuse of a Corpse, and Tampering with Physical Evidence in connection to the November 16 discovery of Darnell’s body in Ridener Cemetery. These indictments come after a preliminary hearing that was held last month during which details of the case were first shared with the public. Whitley County Sheriff’s Office Lieutenant David Lassiter testified at that time that autopsy had revealed that Darnell — a relative who had been placed in Slaughter’s custody — suffered several fractures in her face and skull, separated ribs and fractured ribs. The defendants had told authorities that Darnell died following a fall from a shelf, which was approximately five feet in height, that she frequently climbed. Both Hayes and Slaughter claimed to be high at the time of the purported accident. They also claimed to have performed CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on Darnell’s body for anywhere between six to 10 hours. The time given was inconsistent across interviews, Lt. Lassiter testified. Neighbors and family alike have claimed that Hayes and Slaughter frequently argued, and have been witnessed to engage in domestic disputes/violence. Hayes admitted to have fired a gun, a 9mm handgun, into the ground during one incident. Hayes also admitted to being the “primary disciplinarian” for Darnell. Lt. Lassiter noted that this discipline was considered by those interviewed to be frequently excessive and mostly stemming from Hayes becoming angry with Darnell for using the restroom on herself. Their single wide trailer was in a state of disrepair except, according to Lt. Lassiter, that the floor of Darnell’s room had recently been replaced. He said searching underneath it revealed stains consistent with blood spatter. Hayes and Slaughter are accused of collaborating to conceal the death of Darnell, including the eventual burial of her body in a cemetery on the Daniel Boone National Forest. The pair also, according to preliminary hearing testimony, admitted that there was a plot to blame Darnell’s disappearance on an ex-boyfriend of Slaughter’s. At press time, arraignments have not yet been scheduled in Whitley Circuit Court for Slaughter and Hayes — both of whom remained lodged in the Whitley County Detention Center. An indictment is an accusation only and does not imply guilt or innocence. A person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': ""MURRAY – Two Murray residents have been charged with murder and criminal abuse after police say they denied medical care to a 17-month old girl, ultimately resulting in the child’s death. According to a news release from the Murray Police Department, officers responded at approximately 5 p.m. Monday to the Murray-Calloway County Hospital Emergency Department in regard to an unresponsive 17-month-old female with signs of possible physical abuse. The child was later pronounced deceased. An investigation into the child’s death was conducted in conjunction with the Calloway County Coroner’s Office. MPD detectives gathered evidence, leading to the arrest of Murray residents Chyanne Niemeyer, 24, and Nathaniel Gibson, 20. Niemeyer and Gibson were each charged with murder and criminal abuse in the first degree (child 12 or under). Calloway County District Court Judge Randall Hutchens set the bond for each of them at $500,000 cash and scheduled their preliminary hearings for 9 a.m. Wednesday, Nov. 1. Niemeyer and Gibson both pleaded not guilty during their arraignment Tuesday morning. According to a uniform citation obtained from the court, MPD Detective Justin Swope was called at about 5:10 p.m. Monday to MCCH to investigate possible abuse. Swope wrote on the citation that after his arrived, he observed hospital staff attempting life-saving measures on the young child. He said the victim's skin was bright red and could be observed peeling and coming off various parts of her body. A short time after his arrival, the staff stopped life-saving measures and pronounced the victim deceased by hospital staff. After photographing the victim’s injuries, Swope said he contacted the Calloway County Coroner’s Office. In addition to the skin injuries, Swope said he observed bruising to the victim’s forehead, left cheek and bottom lip. Swope said he went back to the police station and began an interview with Niemeyer, who was identified as the child’s mother, after she was read the Miranda warning and signed a Miranda waiver. Niemeyer stated that her daughter had woken that morning around 9 o’clock and was given a bath around 11. Niemeyer said that at one point in the bath, the child began screaming and crying, and Niemeyer could see steam coming from the tub. She said that after scalding herself while reaching into the tub, she pulled the child out, wrapped her in a towel and subsequently covered the child’s skin in Bengay. Niemeyer told police she clothed the child and gave her to Gibson – who was described in the report as being Niemeyer’s fiancé – in the living room, and although Niemeyer could see the child was having trouble breathing, she left her to go make lunch. They said they gave the child two bottles of milk and put her down for a nap. According to the citation, after about an hour-and-a-half to two hours, Gibson told Niemeyer the child wasn’t breathing, so they put her in the car and drove her to the emergency room. When questioned about the child’s bruising to the child, Niemeyer allegedly admitted to snapping at her when she would scratch or bite and that she had smacked the child in those areas. “When asked why she didn't get medical treatment for her daughter, Chyanne stated she thought she was fine and didn't need to go to the doctor right away,” Swope wrote. “She said (she) and Nathaniel talked about it briefly and decided to wait to go to the doctor because they thought she would be OK. Chyanne was examined and there were no burns or redness to her arms where she said she had reached into the water (to pull the child out of the bath).” Swope said Gibson was also read the Miranda warning and signed a Miranda waiver before he was interviewed. He had a similar timeline of events as Niemeyer, adding he believed the child was in the tub of scalding water for about 10-12 minutes and that she was crying the entire time. He told police the water was too hot to grab the child, so he retrieved a screwdriver to unstop the drain rather than attempting to remove the baby from the water. Swope said Gibson’s account of putting Bengay on the child’s skin was also consistent with Niemeyer’s. Bengay’s website describes the product as being meant for muscle and joint aches and pain and for external use only. It also specifically warns that it should not be used “on wounds or damaged skin” or on a child under 12 years of age. Gibson reportedly told police he was trained in first aid and was going to school to be a nurse, so he thought he could take care of the baby and didn't need to take her to the doctor right away, instead opting to wait and see how she felt later and take her to the doctor then if needed. As was the case with Niemeyer, Swope wrote that Gibson did not have any burns or redness to his arms even though they had both said they had reached into the water to pull the child out of the bath. Swope wrote on the citation that both Niemeyer and Gibson admitted that the right thing to do would have been to take the child to the doctor for treatment but had decided not to. “The parents chose not to provide proper care and treatment of these extreme injuries, refused to take the child to a doctor, failed to notify any emergency services to the injuries, and allowed the victim to suffer for nearly six hours after her initial injuries,” Swope wrote. “Chyanne admitted to additional incidents of abuse on prior occasions. Nathaniel admitted he knowingly failed to provide proper medical care based on his training and attempted ‘home remedies’. Any reasonable individual that would have observed the injuries to this child would have undoubtedly recognized the urgency of needing immediate medical treatment. Chyanne and Nathaniel discussed and decided to deny any medical care to (the child), ultimately leading to prolonged suffering of the victim and her unfortunate death.” The Murray Police Department said it would like to remind the public that all suspects are presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

You may want to spike that nog afterward. Many of you are anxiously waiting to see what Santa will be putting under your tree. Good people get good things and bad people, well, they get asked to resign. It’s been awhile since I complained about Elkhorn City, not because there was nothing to talk about, but because after all my complaining, the voters keep voting the same people in while the ineptness continues. So, I figured that no one in Elkhorn City really cares. The ineptness has gotten to a point where if something is not done, the rest of Pike County may be on the hook to fix their mess. That ineptness, perhaps due to voter apathy, may become the rest of the county’s problem, and we, the rest of the county, certainly didn’t deserve that from old Saint Nick. It has come to our attention that after some city employees retired from their position and tried to file for their deserved retirement, they were denied. Apparently, the city, while taking money from the employee’s paycheck failed to take that money and apply that to the employee’s retirement fund. Not only the employee’s part, but also the city’s matching part was not paid into the fund either. I obtained a copy of a former city employee’s pay stub from throughout the course of the year clearly showing that the money was taken out. However, the pension money that was withheld was never sent into the pension for any employee. The pension fund was questioned at a recent meeting and the council was told it was taken care of and that the issue was a software problem. But when a council member called the state auditor, not only did the council member discovere they were lied to about the issue being resolved, the council member discovered that the payments were not sent in for almost two years. OK — missing a payment may happen. A software glitch could be an issue and the training period of a new clerk may all be defensible. But this went on for two years while a host of other peculiar money issues arose. A reasonable person may say that the annual audit may have caught that deficiency, and a reasonable person would be correct. But the city has not had an audit done for a few years, so there is no way of telling what is missing. A reasonable person would say that since the mistake was made, if it truly was a mistake, then why not make good and send in the money that the city deducted already from the employee’s pay and fund the pension fund? Well that would be great if the money were there. But there is no money. The mayor contacted Pike County Judge-Executive Ray Jones and told him of the financial woes the city is under and asked for a bailout. Jones, a reasonable person, asked the question, “How would you be able to pay the county back when there hasn’t been an audit for a few years and the city has no operating budget to determine how much is coming in and how much is going out?” On top of the pension issue, the council member told me the water bill and the KIA loan is in arrears and there is no money to pay that either. Being delinquent on the KIA loan payments prevents them for applying for grant money and according to one council member they lost out on millions. The council member told me the logical thing to do would be to review the budget and see what can be cut and where the money is going before they would consider any drastic measures like raising taxes. But without a budget they are operating blindly. I was told a letter went to the mayor from the state auditor back in the summer advising the mayor that there would be state auditors reviewing the books at the city. The council members were unaware of this letter and didn’t get a copy of that letter until about two weeks ago. I found out that the state auditors were in Elkhorn City and the council member I spoke to only became aware of that this week. One council member demanded a complete summary of all money in and all money out from 2020 through November of 2023. This may come through in the next two weeks while an independent CPA is allegedly onsite looking into every transaction over the last few years. Elkhorn City has had its issues over the years and it appears as if legal problems will not be evaded. If some employees were knocked out of their retirement benefits because the lack of participation caused them to not be vested, the city will need their lawyer to wake up and start a defense. As you know, the city has issues with their legal representation. One lawyer went to the pen and the other is fighting a major crime allegation. So that leaves the new lawyer who, should be strongly advising their client how to run the city according to code, which could keep the clerk and mayor from facing charges. The mayor has run off every tourist event the city had that generated tourism revenue. The mayor has not had an audit in a few years, he didn’t properly train the city clerk, he has not prepared a budget and he can’t figure out how to pay the city’s bills and apparently has not disclosed the letter from the state’s auditor to the council advising them of the issue. Money is missing and mark my words, after all this comes out, you can bet that he will recommend raising taxes to fund the shortfall that he clearly created. Elkhorn City you deserve better. Mayor Taylor, you need to stop hiding behind the Bible and either man up and run the city like a good steward or resign. That would be the best gift you could give the city.

The half-century of his fire department and EMT service now seems concluded, though, leaving his legacy in Pleasureville and the Henry County community through his works. “I guess you got to love what you do, really,” Young said of his longevity. “You got to care about people and go on all the runs that you can and not pick and choose.” Young also encouraged communities to support their fire departments in the ongoing effort to recruit volunteers and keep serviceable equipment at the ready for response. “Support them, that’s all I know to do,” he said. “It’s hard with such a county. Henry County doesn’t have the funds like La Grange or Shelby County has.” Mayor Young supported the fire department in his official capacity as mayor last year to help secure funding for the new $340,000 fire engine that the city and fire department bought to upgrade their apparatus fleet. Chief Matt Woods of the Pleasureville Fire Department said the new engine adds to the department’s available apparatus that includes a 25-year-old fire engine, a 26-year-old pumper tanker, a 2018 rescue rig and a field unit. Woods said the department had the first fire engine the city ever had up until about two years ago, a 1959 model. “We just didn’t have the funds or the means to restore it,” Woods said. Woods has served as fire chief since 2018 and also served as a volunteer EMT along with Young starting in 1999 when Pleasureville had an EMS service of its own. “I ran with him until about 2012,” Woods said, adding that members of his family had also served with Young over the decades. Another emergency response colleague of Young’s is Bobby Burnett of Campbellsburg, with whom he worked for Baptist Health La Grange for the past four years until Young suffered his debilitation. Their work together, however, goes back farther than that. “We made many a run together. We made many when we were both volunteers,” Young said, also mentioning that Burnett had served as EMT recertification instructor for himself and others. For Young, his half-century-plus of emergency response service has come in the place he calls home. He recalled that he attended the last class at Bethlehem school in the mid-1950s before the school burned down, then he went to school in Pleasureville starting in the seventh grade there. Young eventually left the area to pursue his career but returned in the late 1960s to work in banking in Pleasureville at the current site of Peoples Bank when predecessors Central Bank and PBI Bank operated there.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:02 pm Johnny Riley, of Bellefonte, has spent more than two decades guiding women to alternatives to abortions at Two Hearts Pregnancy Care Center in Ashland. After serving 25 years as chairman of the board at Two Hearts on 29th Street, the 75-year-old Riley said it’s time to pass the torch. His last day is Dec. 31. Looking back on the number of years spent dedicated to pursuing a passion of saving the lives of babies and mothers has been a blessing, he said. “We saw a need in this area for girls that had unwanted pregnancies,” Riley said. “We believe everyone has a purpose in life. I stayed because I had a desire and it’s been a great ministry for this area. There have been thousands of young ladies helped.” Two Hearts, which started as a committee in the late 1990s, has since transformed through time. Since the creation, Riley said he has witnessed first hand how the pregnancy care center has touched the lives of women. He said there have been a number of letters sent to the building thanking them for their care and commitment of helping them keep their babies. “We’ve had a lot of stories like that about how they have been helped and it’s good when you see it come back like that,” Riley said. “I feel glad for the person, I feel glad that a child gets to live out the purpose that God intended for he or she to have in the first place. “The great thing is that we are here; the sad thing is that we need to be here. It’s going to be needed for a long long time, the situation is not getting better. These girls need support, and they need somebody to love them — someone to show them that Christ loves them.” The pro-life center was founded on a mission of steering women away from choosing to have an abortion and instead providing alternatives like resources, counseling and referrals to help women keep their baby. Riley said there have been great accomplishments over the years. He said stepping down is sort of a way to help transform the center and keep it moving on a track of success. “Hopefully they think I was a good chairman,” he laughed. “It’s time to step down — a chairman needs to have good connection with the community. and I don’t have that connection like I used to. They haven’t asked me to step down, I just feel like I need to do it for the good of the ministry. If I had it my way I would do it forever.” He added, “We had volunteers that have been there for years and years. The staff has been wonderful, we have been blessed with a good faithful staff. It’s because of them that it made it easy for me. Sandy Bellomy has been a wonderful executive director.” In a tearful phone call, Bellomy, Director of Two Hearts for the last 19 years, described Riley as a “big lovable goofball” who was “always making jokes.” She said he will be remembered for his spiritual guidance of the ministry.” “When my first husband died he was right there, he’s always been there for me. This is very hard,” she said while crying. “This is very hard for me. I’ve never had somebody like that to depend on, to rely on, to know I could go to him at any time, day or night, and he would always listen. Bellomy added, “Jesus is the head of this ministry, but Johnny was the one that God had directing it.” Bellomy said, “He would tell me if i was doing something wrong or if I needed to do something different, but that was the kind of relationship we had. He was my mentor. ... When he was around, there was always a feeling of comfort and peace.” (606) 326-2657 | ajohnson@dailyindependent.com Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:09 pm Dean Lovins Terry Vanover Andrew Dodson Junior Dick Richard Keith James Loveless Lewis and Carol Catron Charlie Taylor Morris Norfleet Michael Kean Bruce Orwin Each year, Pulaski County says goodbye to some of its most notable community members, and such was the case again in 2023. That number included notable businessmen, government leaders across Pulaski’s smaller communities, and some lives tragically taken in their prime. It also included perhaps the funniest obituary that’s ever been written — for which it became a viral sensation. The following is by no means a comprehensive list of those who died locally in the year now concluding, but it is a look back at some of the familiar names who were profiled in the Commonwealth Journal upon their passing, to honor their memory and their tremendous legacies. In February, the community said farewell to 90-year-old Dean Lovins — a not only a former city councilor in Burnside but also mayor of the “only town on Lake Cumberland” in 2005 and ‘06, after essentially switching places with then-mayor Jim Rasnick at the start of ‘05, filling out the rest of Rasnick’s term while he took Lovins’ seat on the council. Lovins guided Burnside through one of its most transformative periods, taking in Lake Cumberland shoreline to reach Lee’s Ford Marina so the Harbor Restaurant could serve alcohol. Lovins was also a local businessman, a U.S. Navy veteran in the Korean War, and a Kentucky Colonel. Another Burnside City Councilor passed away in March — this time one who was actively serving. Terry Vanover passed at age 75, and despite his battle with cancer, Vanover continued to show up at Burnside City Hall and represent the people of Burnside up until the last couple meetings before his death. Vanover also served on other boards representing the city, including the Police Committee and the Tourism Commission, and worked in security for AHF Products after a long career in printing in Ohio. In April, the community was rocked by the loss of Pulaski County High School junior Andrew Dodson, 17. Dodson was participating in a spring scrimmage with the Maroons football team when he suffered a brain injury while being tackled. Surgery was done on the youth, but he never recovered and eventually succumbed. Dodson’s story touched people not only across the commonwealth but also the nation. University of Kentucky Football Coach Mark Stoops said that lights would be turned on for 80 minutes at Lexington’s Kroger Field in honor of Dodson, who word jersey no. 80; other football fields across the state did the same. The news of Dodson’s death was reported by the national Associated Press and ESPN. Another former mayor died in April, when Junior Dick passed away at age 83. Dick was mayor of Science Hill from 1992 to 1998, and also served as a city commissioner both before and after that period. Dick was in office at the time of one of the more seminal developments in Science Hill’s modern history, the installation of the town’s sewer system. As a barber, Dick cut the hair of many in the community, and also worked with the county’s PVA office. He served in the U.S. Navy and National Guard Reserves. Another April death was that of 90-year-old Richard Keith, who left behind a generation of local ice-cream loving followers. For 32 years, from 1959 to 1991, Richard and his wife Quinta Keith owned and operated the downtown Somerset Dairy Queen restaurant on North Main Street from 1958 until 1991, when he sold the DQ and went to work for the Somerset Independent School system as a bus driver. He served the SHS community long before that though, with so many students leaving school every day to walk down Oak Street and enjoy a DQ treat after school or even for lunch. Keith also served in the U.S. Army. James Loveless may not have been a well-known community figure during his life but he became one after passing away in June at age 60, thanks to a hilarious tongue-in-cheek obituary written by his son Rocky. The obit was placed on the Pulaski Funeral Home website and became a viral sensation on social media, shared over and over and viewed hundreds of thousands of times, and even discussed in entertainment media like Kentucky Sports Radio. In July, Harold “Lewis” Catron — brother of late Pulaski Sheriff Sam Catron — and wife Carol were both found dead of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning. Lewis was 77 and Carol was 73. It was another tragic chapter for the family which had already seen Sam become the victim of a high-profile political assassination in 2002, and the brothers’ father, late Somerset Police Chief Harold Lewis Catron, who died from in 1964 from injuries sustained from being shot in 1957. The younger Harold Lewis was known as a loyal supporter of local law enforcement, beloved throughout that community, and served as a part-time sheriff’s deputy, as well as on the Rescue Squad and the Eubank and Shopville Fire Departments, in addition to jobs with Food Fair and the Kentucky Lottery. In August, the Somerset Independent Schools community mourned the loss of longtime teacher and coach Charlie Taylor, who died at age 87. Taylor coached the Briar Jumper baseball program to well over 700 wins, including 11 regional crowns and a state tournament championship in 1974, in addition to numerous district titles. He was considered one of the most respected and top baseball minds that ever sat in a dugout during a high school baseball game, so much so that the venue where SHS baseball plays today bears the name Charlie Taylor Field. He was inducted into four Hall of Fames — the Kentucky High School Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame, the Somerset High School Hall of Fame, the Army Hall of Fame, and the Lincoln Memorial University Hall of Fame. Taylor served in the U.S. Army after playing college baseball at Lincoln Memorial University, taught science courses at Somerset High School, and also coached as an assistant n basketball and football, and was the school’s longest-tenured coach. Morris Norfleet passed away at age 92 in September. The Nancy native was a longtime proponent for the advancement of education in this region, and was the eighth president of Morehead State University, serving from 1977 to 1984. He also vocally pushed for a four-year university here in Pulaski County and placed his support behind the University Center of Southern Kentucky, SCC’s partnership with several four-year institutions across the state, when that took shape in 2018. Norfleet also had a calling for mission work, spreading the Gospel on journeys to Russia, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Djibouti, Brazil and Eastern Kentucky. In 2006, he received the Missionary of the Year award in Kentucky. In September, another untimely death occurred during a football game, this time to a coach. Michael Kean, 34, suffered a medical emergency while on the field at Pulaski County High School for that day’s slate of youth football games which resulted in him passing away. Kean, who attended high school in McCreary County and served in the U.S. Army before coming to Eubank, coached teams with students from Eubank Elementary School, where three of his own children attended, each playing football themselves. Teams include Pee-Wee, Junior, and Senior based on age groups. In late October, local attorney, conservationist, and photographer Bruce Orwin died at age 68 after a battle with cancer.

Hernandez has been found guilty of capital murder. DALLAS — (TNS) The man who opened fire inside Methodist Dallas Medical Center, killing two medical workers, was found guilty Thursday of capital murder. Nestor Hernandez, 31, will be automatically sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Dallas County prosecutors did not seek the death penalty. The 12-person panel weighed whether Hernandez knowingly or intentionally killed the women to find him guilty of capital murder. They were also asked to consider lesser charges, like murder, manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, which carry lighter sentences and are eligible for parole. The Dallas County jury deliberated for almost an hour and a half and asked to review police body-camera video and hospital surveillance footage of the shooting. Hernandez murdered nurse Katie Flowers and social worker Jacqueline Pokuaa last fall at the north Oak Cliff Hospital. Testimony in the high-profile trial ended Wednesday evening; the jurors heard from eyewitnesses, experts and Hernandez himself, who admitted to killing Flowers and Pokuaa but said it was an accident. Family and friends of Flowers seemingly jumped up from their courtroom gallery benches when State District Judge Chika Anyiam read the unanimous verdict aloud. They let out their held breaths and some let out whispered exclaims of “yes” and “it’s okay.” After the jury was dismissed, the family hugged and thanked prosecutors, including District Attorney John Creuzot. The jury found Hernandez knowingly or intentionally killed the women to find him guilty of capital murder. Hernandez, who had a history of robbery convictions and was on parole with an ankle monitor at the time of the shooting, was at the hospital Oct. 22, 2022, to visit his girlfriend, Selena Villatoro, and their newborn baby in the labor and delivery ward. Villatoro had given birth the day before. She testified she gave him an ultimatum: ditch his black pistol or she wouldn’t give the baby his last name. Hernandez said he left the gun in her makeup bag. Villatoro testified Hernandez became enraged, accused her of infidelity and pistol-whipped her. He then threatened to kill her, himself and anyone who came into the room, she said. Pokuaa, the social worker, went into Room 6 for routine patient care and Hernandez shot her in the back of her head, Villatoro said. But on the witness stand, Hernandez said he and Villatoro were fighting when Pokuaa tried to intervene and the handgun misfired. In a panic, he then shot into the hallway, striking Flowers, before a Methodist police officer shot Hernandez in the upper thigh. In closing arguments, District Attorney John Creuzot — who led jury selection for prosecutors and sat behind the attorneys throughout testimony — said Hernandez went to the hospital that day with “rage, resentment, anger and a plan to kill” while masquerading as a doting new father. He said Hernandez, who had methamphetamine in his blood and carried a beer to the maternity wing, was on a “mission to kill.” “The plan,” Creuzot said, “was to wreak chaos and kill.” Prosecutor George Lewis said the women’s injuries and unused bullets found in the hospital room proved Hernandez acted deliberately. He was motivated by his beliefs that Villatoro cheated on him; that he wasn’t the baby’s father; and that she’d given him a sexually transmitted disease. During testimony, prosecutors presented a paternity test showing Hernandez was the newborn’s father. Lewis, in his impassioned argument, called Hernandez a coward. Family and friends of Flowers seated nodded and whispered in agreement. Defense attorneys conceded in their closing statements that Hernandez did open fire but said he didn’t intend to kill anyone. They then asked jurors to consider a lesser charge. Hernandez huddled with his attorneys at times throughout the morning. Lawyer Paul Johnson said Hernandez and Villatoro were in a fraught on-again, off-again relationship and she was using their son’s birth certificate and what last name to give him over Hernandez’s head. The fight, Johnson said, grew out of control, escalated by Villatoro, when the gun went off, almost instantly killing Pokuaa. Johnson asked the jury to rule in favor of “justice and not revenge.” The jurors nodded along and some pursed their lips as the lawyers spoke. Closing arguments were delayed by a few hours Thursday morning because one juror was late. Creuzot asked State District Judge Chika Anyiam to dismiss the juror, alleging the juror seemed confused and smelled of alcohol. Anyiam briefly questioned the juror before allowing him to stay on the panel. Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup. Error! There was an error processing your request.

That readership number is based on a recent national study by independent research firm Coda Ventures for the America’s Newspapers organization. Most likely, the number Americans depend on newspapers to stay informed about their communities of readers is higher. Many people who say they receive news on their phone or from social media instead of newspapers fail to understand that the sources for those stories are often journalists at U.S. newspapers. We sometimes take the work of journalists for granted, but those who work at newspapers are filling an important role in the health of our communities and country. Everyone, even nonreaders, benefits from the work of journalists. News coverage has led to improvements in food safety, decreases in traffic and plane fatalities, better care for veterans and nursing home patients, support for victims of natural disasters, and exposure of all sorts of wrongdoing. I have long loved this quotation by Frank Batten Sr., a media visionary and former chairman of Landmark Communications, who said about journalists and newspapers: “Our calling was never more important. We have the capacity to inform, to enlighten, to awaken and to inspire. We have the opportunity to enrich the lives of thousands of people every day.” Across the United States, journalists and other newspaper employees are serving their communities and democracy every day by informing, enlightening, awakening and inspiring millions of readers. The news they provide is accessed in many forms. Many people still use the word newspaper as the all-encompassing term for those various forms, but now news is delivered news through websites, social media, electronic editions, email alerts and newsletters, in addition to the traditional printed paper. Those delivery methods have changed significantly in recent years. But one thing remains constant: Americans depend on the trusted news coverage provided by newspapers. The study by Coda Ventures, based on surveys of 5,000 people, revealed that respondents ranked local newspapers and their websites as the most accurate sources of original news reporting. The results also listed the top five reasons Americans seek out local news – to stay informed, feel connected in the community, decide where they stand on local issues, find places and things to do, and talk to other people about community news. Survey respondents consistently said they prefer newspapers in print and digital formats over TV, radio and social media as their main source for news and information important to them. They like the fact that newspapers use different ways to deliver their news stories to various audiences. The survey showed that people who are 39 and younger listed social media as the No. 1 way they prefer to access news, though they also like news websites and email alerts. People in the 40 to 74 age group ranked news websites as their top choice, followed by email alerts and the printed newspaper. Those 75 and older prefer the print edition but also like news websites and email alerts. Based on the frequent reports of struggles within the news business, many people might be surprised to learn that newspapers and their digital offerings reach so many readers. Those struggles, primarily financial, are real and affect many media companies, not just newspapers. But the new ways of delivering news allow newspapers to reach even larger audiences. Frank Batten might not have anticipated the wide-spread use of the internet and social media when he first made his comments in the 1980s, but his words remain true today. Newspapers and their dedicated employees continue to inform, enlighten, awaken and inspire – enriching their communities and the lives of millions of people who benefit from their work every day.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'June 1, 2024 The November 28 edition of the Falmouth Outlook presented a press release from Falmouth City Council. The release explained the council’s reasons for leaving the meeting, following a motion that was made by Councilperson Luke Price and was seconded by Councilperson Sabrina Hazen, and then was voted by a roll-call vote (called by City Attorney Brandon Voelker as City Clerk Susan Bishop would not do so, according to Voelker). The Falmouth Outlook did not receive a communication from Mayor Sebastian Ernst until after the press release ran. Although the Mayor apparently attempted to provide a comment to the paper earlier, he failed to notice the Outlook was not included in the list of emails that had the first copy of the press release. The Outlook received the release separately. We are sharing portions of that release here, including portions we know to be true through reliable evidence such as open records, as well as other information we know to be true regarding the other elements. We are not sharing other portions of the release that contain information the Outlook could not verify, or information about private figures that appears to be false. In some instances below, we address the redactions to the extent they relate to the Mayor or city business. • The mayor claims to represent the executive branch of the city. That is true in a mayor-council government, which is the type of government Falmouth represents. 30.01 The form of government provided for this city shall be known as the “Mayor-Council Plan.”(KRS 83A.130 (1)) 30.02(A)The city shall be governed by an elected executive who shall be called Mayor and by an elected legislative body which shall be called the City Council, and by such other officers and employees as are provided for by statute or city ordinance. (KRS 83A.130 (2)) • The mayor claims the council violated the open meetings act. That appears to be false. A meeting took place with the Kentucky League of Cities after the mayor’s conduct did not allow the agenda to be followed the night of November 21, which was a regular meeting where voting was to take place. Council members Bob Pettit, Luke Price, and Sabrina Hazen were at the meeting. Four of the six need to be present to meet the requirements of a quorum. Hazen responded to Ernst’s insistence the meeting was illegal by clarifying the press release was a statement, not a resolution, and that “the statement was prepared and then circulated among council members for their review and signature if they all agreed.” The statement, she said, was then sent to city hall before it was sent to the Outlook. She also clarified, as does 30.02 above, that the “council is an independent branch of city government, and [council] can have anybody we want prepare anything for us, and we are not required to run anything through city hall at any time.” Hazen continued by saying nothing prohibits council from issuing statements jointly or collectively, as they did. • Ernst demanded the resignation of all six council members, saying they violated the law. As explained above, however, it does not appear that any violation took place. • Ernst stated he would not award a fire hydrant contract to the lowest bidder, citing legal reasons. Contracts are voted into place by city council, not awarded by the mayor. • The mayor said he would be filing open records requests to seek out illegal activities, stating he was sure they exist. He has as much right as anyone to file open records requests. He accused council of having personal agendas, that being the reason he said they would not stay to listen to his presentation at the last meeting. • He stated the council was ruled out-of-order at the meeting. That appears to be inaccurate. “If a meeting participant believes that the meeting is progressing outside of the rules of order, the person can raise a ‘point of order,’” says the National Association of Counties. Such a ruling was never mentioned. The only statement that came close to such a ruling came from Police Chief Marty Hart when he quieted the crowd as he felt it may get out of hand, explaining he had the jurisdiction to remove anyone who got unruly. Ernst also stated the council attempted to obstruct government; however, neither the agenda that was emailed the night before nor the agenda presented the evening of the meeting was addressed. A video presenting Charlie Chaplin as Hitler, Santa Claus, and a speech from the mayor was presented, but nothing from the agenda, a fact he cited at the end of the forum by going over the topics that he said were to be addressed, but could not be because the council adjourned, again, which they had done seeing nothing would happen that included the business at hand. Nothing from the earlier caucus, held on Election Night, was put on the agenda except the Klee property. • Ernst closed the release by saying he would take the signed and submitted press release as the full council’s resignations. He went on to accuse council of underhanded activities and bringing “harm to the city.” He also said he would address these accusations at the next meeting and “publicly here soon.” The press release does not entail a resignation. Ord. 32.02 (1) No vacancy by reason of a voluntary resignation of a member of the Council shall occur unless a written resignation date is tendered to the Council. The resignation shall be effective at the next regular or special meeting of the Council occurring after the date specified in the written letter of resignation.

Faulkner said that in past elections, her office has typically ordered printed ballots for each precinct, and the number of ballots she ordered depended on how many registered voters were in each precinct. After the pandemic, the Kentucky General Assembly voted to change the law to allow for the establishment of voting centers instead of counties being required to have a polling place for all 27 of Calloway County’s precincts. For the May 16 primary election, the elections board has decided to have seven voting centers across the county, which will include four Murray locations, as well as New Concord, Elm Grove, Hazel and Kirksey. “What this printer does is simply print out a blank ballot,” Faulkner said. “Right now, we have to order ballots, so when we had precincts and we voted at every precinct, I knew there was an expected 60% turnout in Hazel (for example). So based on those voters, we would order (enough ballots for 60% of registered voters), and they would be there and ready. You would always have a little bit extra, but that was understandable and you always had enough. “With the vote centers, it’s hard to determine (where residents of certain areas will vote). Are people from Hazel going to go to the CFSB Center instead? Are the people who usually vote in Elm Grove actually going to find it easier to vote at Southwest? So there’s a lot of possible waste there. For every bundle of ballots, it’s ‘X’ amount of dollars that are just being shredded and gotten rid of after the fact. This way, there won't necessarily be a plan; we’ll have the ballot paper in the printer, and it'll print those out, and that waste is going to be brought down quite a bit because that blank ballot paper can be used in the future.” Faulkner said Calloway County received a grant of around $186,000 to purchase electronic voting equipment, and the board recently opted to spend about $59,000 on KNOWiNK poll pads, which will be used instead of paper poll books to check in voters as they arrive. That means the Clerk’s Office still has some money to spend on other equipment, so Faulkner recommended the purchase of 27 on-demand ballot printers. “With this device, a voter checks in, they get their tab and it’s got a barcode on it,” Faulkner told the board. “Then they walk over to a print on-demand (machine), scan that in, and with that, their ballot prints out. … It’s streamlined; it gives the voter the ballot they need, they go and fill it out and they scan it in. So there’s no electronic trail that’s determining who voted what. They get a blank ballot, they fill it out with a pencil and scan it in.” Faulkner said 27 on-demand ballot printers would match the number of precincts in the county, and she said her office would try to distribute them according to the expected needs for each voting center. “Ideally, we’ll put one with each poll pad so that we won’t get caught up in a line with different poll pads needing to print a ballot,” Faulkner said. Faulkner said she plans to request that the Calloway County Fiscal Court pass a resolution authorizing the purchase at the court’s regular meeting Wednesday morning. While it is too late for all 27 machines to arrive in time for the May primary, election workers will be able to test one out for the six days of in-person absentee voting in the Clerk’s Office and during the three early voting days at the Courthouse Annex, Faulkner said. That way, election workers should be prepared by the time all 27 machines are implemented and a larger number of voters turn out for the general election in November, she said. Monday, April 17, was the last day to register and be eligible to vote in the primary. Eligible voters may request a mail-in absentee ballot until Tuesday, May 2, by visiting govote.ky.gov. Excused, in-person absentee voting will be from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. May 3-10 on weekdays in the County Clerk’s Office on the second floor of the courthouse. Early voting will be available at the Miller Courthouse Annex from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Thursday, May 11; 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday, May 12; and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday, May 13. Voting centers on Election Day may be used by any Calloway County registered voter regardless of their address. The centers will be open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and will include: • CFSB Center at 1401 KY 121 in Murray, North Entrance B • New Concord Church of Christ at 121 Artesian Drive in New Concord • Elm Grove Baptist Church at 6483 KY 94 East in Murray • Hazel Baptist Church at 101 Third St. in Hazel • North Calloway Elementary at 2928 Brinn Road in Murray • Southwest Calloway Elementary at 3426 Wiswell Rd Murray • Kirksey Baptist Church at 301 Backusburg Road in Kirksey The Certification and Accuracy Board will meet on April 28, the Board of Elections will meet next at 5 p.m. on May 5 for election training with the volunteer election workers.

Thursday night against the Boyle County Lady Rebels (4-2). Lady Mustang head coach Mac McIntosh was proud of his team’s performance. They outrebounded an opponent for the first time this season. Even with the slow start to the season, he wants his team to focus on the marathon of the season and not get caught up on the early stage of the year. “I think the girls are really focused on understanding that this is a long season,” McIntosh said. “If we make small improvements and adjustments here, we’re going to be a competitive basketball team that is going to have a shot at winning this district. We’re not going to get it today or tomorrow but little things through communication, through encouragement, through understanding the game a little differently. They’re growing and maturing in a lot of ways that from a coaching staff we already see.” North Oldham senior Gracie Sipes led the team with 16 points on the night. Senior Katie Smith scored nine points, all on free throws, while picking up six rebounds and five steals. “That’s how I earned my spot a couple of years back, because I play defense,” Smith said. “Right now, I’m struggling to find my shot, but I know I can always fall back on my defense. Playing good defense is something that Saylor [Hankins] and I tell the girls every day is, ‘you don’t have to be the best girl on the court to play good defense.’ We’re really working on that.” Boyle County started the scoring on the night with a mid-ranged, banked in shot by junior Kennedy Bugg. North’s first score of the night came from sophomore Izzy Gross off an assist by senior Saylor Hankins. The Lady Rebels answered with another mid-range shot by senior Payton Bugg that banked in. Senior Annabelle Tarter gave Boyle County a four-point lead on a layup. Sipes responded for the Lady Mustangs with two 3-pointers to give them a 8-6 lead. Gross grabbed an offensive rebound and drew a foul. She made one of her two free throws to extend the North lead. With under two minutes left in the first quarter, Boyle County scored five straight points to retake the lead on a layup by sophomore Braylee Leffew and three by eighth grader Addison Yates. Gross tied the game on a layup before eighth grader Hadley Russell hit a three with 40 seconds left in the quarter. Gross drew a shooting foul after an offensive rebound. She made her first free throw but missed the second. Hankins grabbed the board and passed to Sipes. Sipes tied the game on a floater. Yates made a three with three seconds left in quarter, giving the Lady Rebels a 17-14 lead. The second quarter started with a layup in transition by Yates. Both defenses held each other scoreless for the next three and half minutes of play. Payton Bugg made a floater for Boyle County to end the drought. Sipes drained a 3-pointer on the next possession for the first points of the quarter for North Oldham. Smith stole the ball and drew a foul for the Lady Mustangs. She made both of her free throws to cut the deficit to one point. Sophomore Maggie Burke answered with a layup. Burke made a free throw with four seconds left to give the Lady Rebels a 24-20 lead at half. Eighth grader Greyson Luehrs drained a three for North on the first possession of the second half. Smith knows Luehrs is a talented shooter, so she wants her to build confidence in her ability. “A lot of times people think dribble first, but with us, we just want her to fire the ball, because she’s so good at shooting,” Smith said. “We’re just working on her shooting in rhythm with our offense.” Boyle County grew its largest lead of the game after the three. Kennedy Bugg made one free throw before senior Andie Glasscock and Yates hit a three, giving the Lady Rebels a 31-23 lead. Smith put North Oldham back on the board with two made free throws. Glasscock put Boyle County in the bonus, making one of her two free throws. Luehrs responded with a three to cut into the deficit. “We know that a lot of the focus is going to go on Katie Smith and Gracie Sipes and so forth, so we know that our other wing, which is Grayson Luehrs, is going to get the ball with an opportunity to score numerous times a game,” McIntosh said. “We want her to be aggressive, we’re trying to encourage her…She’s taking some time to adjust, but she is doing a little bit better job. We’re getting into some film study, all of these things, breaking it down for her. She’s taken to it. The best thing about Greyson Luehrs, she’s coachable.” The Lady Rebels grew its lead at the end of the third period. Burke made one free throw, and Russell made a contested layup. Boyle County led 35-28 at the end of three quarters. “Right now, we’re still early in the season, especially for the younger girls,” Hankins said. “When we do get in foul trouble, we don’t have a very deep bench to rely on other players. We just need to keep growing and keep working with our bench too, so they’re ready to come compete.” The fourth quarter started with both teams not scoring a point for over two minutes, but the Lady Mustangs drew fouls to get into the bonus with 6:25 left in the game. Smith scored the first two points of the period on free throws. Leffew drilled a three, pushing the Lady Rebel lead to seven points. Smith drew another foul on a three-point shot. She made two of the three free throws. Payton Bugg made a layup before Tarter made a free throw to keep North at arm’s length. Sipes made a 3-pointer with 2:20 left in the game to cut the deficit to two possessions. Boyle County halted a late surge from North Oldham. Senior Harper Coffey made a layup while Glasscock made two free throws and one more 30 seconds later. Sipes made a layup, but the Lady Rebels held on for a 45-37 win. “I just think we need to give effort 100% of the game and get more aggressive to compete with these teams,” Hankins said. North Oldham will be back at home on Saturday against the Walton-Verona Bearcats (2-4) at 12:30 p.m. “Let’s start winning at the game of basketball, limit your turnovers, rebound at a high level and do what you do better than the other team and focus on that, take away their strengths,” McIntosh said.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:09 pm A Wednesday accident on Ky. 914 has claimed the life of a Lily man, according to the Ferguson Police Department. Ronnie Lee Taylor, 67, was pronounced dead at around 6 p.m. Friday at the UK Medical Center in Lexington, a little more than two days after the accident. The crash took place around 5:01 p.m. Wednesday, just east of the 11-mile marker on Ky. 914, Ferguson Police Chief David Cornett said. Cornett reported that Taylor was driving a 2001 white Dodge Ram pickup eastbound, towing a 1999 maroon Dodge pickup with a towbar. It appeared that Taylor lost control of his vehicle, crossed the median and crossed both westbound lanes before leaving the roadway and striking a rock embankment. Taylor was the only passenger in the vehicle, and the only vehicles involved were the two Dodge pickups, Cornett said. Taylor may have had a medical emergency before the accident took place, Cornett said. Taylor was transported to the Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital before he was flown to the UK Medical Center for further treatment. Assisting at the scene were the Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office, Ferguson Fire Department and Somerset-Pulaski County EMS.

pandemic is no longer a national emergency, but the virus that caused it isn’t gone — and neither is the risk of getting the disease, says Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. It published a Q and A with Dr. Michael Smit, the hospital’s medical director of infection prevention and control: Who is eligible for the bivalent COVID-19 vaccine that was approved last fall? Everyone who is 6 months and older should get a bivalent booster dose as long as it has been at least two months since they received a monovalent vaccine dose, which was the original COVID vaccine. People who are 6 years and older and who are immunocompromised can also receive a second dose of bivalent vaccine at least two months after their first dose of the bivalent. If you have questions about the eligibility of you or your child to get the booster, you should check with your medical provider. For children who are getting their first COVID-19 vaccine shot, will they receive the original monovalent series or the bivalent vaccine? The current COVID-19 vaccine guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which were updated in May 2023, recommend that unvaccinated children 6 months and older get the bivalent vaccine. Are children who received the original COVID vaccine series eligible for the bivalent booster? Yes. Children who already received the original vaccine series are eligible for the bivalent vaccine. The guidelines can be complicated if your child has previously received the original vaccine, so I recommend consulting public health guidelines and your medical provider. Coronavirus cases are waning in most places in the U.S. Do you recommend getting the bivalent vaccine if you haven’t gotten it? I recommend following vaccine guidelines provided by U.S. public health agencies such as the CDC and the California Department of Public Health. Although COVID-19 cases are currently low, it is still a serious disease that can cause illness, hospitalization and death. What does the research show about side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine in children? Side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine tend to be mild and temporary. The most common side effects for children ages 6 months to 3 years include pain on the leg or arm where the shot was given, swollen lymph nodes, irritability or crying, sleepiness and loss of appetite. For children 4 to 17, side effects also include pain at the site where the shot was given, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue. This age group can also experience headaches, chills, muscle aches and loss of appetite. In some rare cases, adolescent boys have been found to experience myocarditis, a rare inflammation of the heart, after vaccination. However, the risk of this condition is higher for children who get infected with COVID-19 than for those who have received the vaccine. The CDC has indicated that people will get a COVID-19 vaccine shot once a year. Is that for everyone? People 65 and older can receive a dose of the bivalent vaccine at least four months after the first dose. I recommend that people discuss whether to get the additional booster with their medical provider. The CDC has not announced a second booster shot for groups other than those who are 65 and older or people who are immunocompromised. Can children get long COVID? Is there a way to protect against long COVID in kids or adults? Yes, children get long COVID. The best way to protect anyone against long COVID is to remain up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations. If you do not get COVID-19, you will not get long COVID. If you do get COVID-19 after being vaccinated, you are less likely to develop long COVID. Are there medications available for adults or children if they get infected with COVID-19? Yes, there are medications available for both adults and children if they get COVID-19. These medications can have interactions with other medications or have specific indications for use based on an individual’s health status. I recommend discussing taking any COVID-19 medications with your medical provider. What are the isolation rules today if someone is infected with COVID-19? If you test positive for COVID-19, current isolation guidelines from the CDC depend on whether or not you have symptoms. Regardless of symptoms, if you test positive you should isolate for five days. If you must be around others, you should wear a high-quality mask and avoid contact as much as possible. If you do not have symptoms, isolation is completed after day five, with day zero being the day you had a positive test. If you do have symptoms, then you may end isolation after day five as long as you are fever-free and your symptoms are improving. If you are experiencing moderate symptoms, including shortness of breath, you should isolate for 10 days. For moderate or severe cases, you should discuss specific isolation details with your medical provider. What are the best ways to avoid COVID-19 at this point? The best way to avoid COVID-19 is to stay up to date on your vaccines. This decreases your chances of catching COVID-19, which, in turn, greatly decreases your chances of developing long COVID. You can also decrease your chances of getting COVID-19 by avoiding crowded situations where you cannot maintain physical distancing of about 3 feet — arm’s length — from others. If crowded situations cannot be avoided, then wearing a well-fitting mask may decrease your chances of getting COVID-19, but only if the mask is worn correctly and consistently. tshaw@sentinelnews.com Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers:'}]"

Daniel Cameron Republic Candidate for KY Gov. Kentucky’s gubernatorial race this year is set to serve as a stress test for Democrats’ ability to survive in GOP-dominated states, local operatives and observers say — as the party’s hold on the Senate and White House relies on 2024 contests in similarly red and purple swaths of the country. First-term Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat who beat Republican predecessor Matt Bevin by only about5,000 votes in 2019, enters his reelection without Bevin’s unpopularity and with broad name recognition and a platform divorced from national debates and focused on local issues. After four years in office, according to strategists, Beshear doesn’t have some of Bevin’s liabilities as a candidate. A former state attorney general —whose father, also a Democrat, was governor from 2007-2015 — Beshear has emphasized his work helping Kentucky recover from a string of natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic while shrugging off nationalized labels. That go-everywhere approach, even Republican critics acknowledge, helps burnish his reputation as both an executive and empathizer. “Beshear is going to be difficult to beat, and I would argue he’s probably the front-runner,” said Kentucky-based GOP strategist Scott Jennings, an adviser to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Daniel Cameron is seen as a rising star and is a protégé of McConnell, the Senate GOP leader. Still, Beshear has one main weakness, according to his opponents: He’s a Democrat in a ruby-red state where Republicans dominate many levels of government. The outcome of his re-election bid, with his Republican challenger still not decided, could indicate the viability of candidates like him in races next year in Republican-friendly Montana, Ohio and West Virginia, where Democrats are defending Senate seats and hoping to hold onto their narrow majority in the chamber. The path for President Joe Biden’s 2024 reelection, should he run again as expected, likely also relies on winning traditionally Republican states like Arizona and Georgia, as he did in 2020. Both parties are already rifling for clues to next year’s political atmosphere. Beshear’s upset win in 2019 held hints for the following cycle, Jennings told ABC News: “I think you might be able to look in certain kinds of voter pockets and demographic pockets and see who did what. I do think some of the suburban, center rightish, moderate-type Republicans held out against Bevin in ’19 and that was a little bit of a foreshadowing of what happened to Trump in ’20.” “I also think that demographically, Beshear does a little better with older voters than Democrats do. That’s something that I think Biden experienced in ’20,” Jennings said. Blueprint for success? Beshear has occupied a somewhat hard-to-define position on the ideological spectrum, opposing strict abortion restrictions, legalizing medical marijuana and allowing voting rights for felons, with exceptions, while also advocating for certain tax cuts and raising state trooper pay. He’s also portrayed himself as a strong steward of the state economy, celebrating a $5.8 billion in-vestment by Ford announced in 2021 while boasting of an unemployment rate at or below 3.9% for the longest stretch in state history. The governor “has been pretty savvy at trying to position himself as a non-ideological actor, almost like a technocrat or a bureaucrat,” Jennings said. Even as Jennings felt that Beshear had “done some things … that have been terribly liberal,” those decisions “haven’t gotten the attention that the rest of the things he’s done in his term have gotten. That’s where the Republicans have to draw that out.” Perhaps more than anything, Kentucky political experts said, Beshear’s brand has been boosted by his on-the-ground response to a deadly tornado in the western part of the state in 2021 and flooding in eastern Kentucky last year. “It’s harder to demonize somebody when they have looked you in the eye, they’ve shaken your hand, they’ve given you a hug, they helped out your community directly,” said Kentucky Democratic strategist Mark Riddle. Recent Stories from ABC News “Gov.

Sherrod Brown hopes to buck his state’s rightward shift and win a fourth term. Beshear, Lin said, has “been outspoken about how his Christian faith informs his values. I think those are blueprints all Dems should look to for success in tough states.” But he’s also been largely unscathed by Republican attacks so far and will have to convince a broad swath of Republicans to vote for him again against a nominee who is not anticipated to be bogged down as Bevin was. “I think that Andy Beshear is in about as strong a position as a Democratic incumbent governor could be in Kentucky, but that’s still far from an assured victory because so much in the state has become so red in recent years,” Kentucky GOP political consultant T.J.

Two independent types of tests were performed on tissue collected from a 2 ½-year-old male white-tailed deer that was harvested by a hunter in Ballard County in November. Both tests yielded the same test result: the deer was infected with the abnormal proteins that cause CWD. It is Kentucky’s first documented case of the disease. While no conclusive evidence exists that CWD can be transmitted to people, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends refraining from eating meat from animals that test positive for CWD. Kentucky Fish and Wildlife always advises against eating the meat from game animals that appear sick or in poor condition. Deer that appear to be sick but do not have an obvious injury can be reported using the department’s sick deer online reporting form; reports will be reviewed by the agency’s wildlife health program staff, who will contact the person submitting the report if additional information is needed. As Kentucky Fish and Wildlife staff continue to gather additional details about the infected deer, agency officials are in close communication with national, state and local partners as they carefully consider next steps in response to the detection. “We at Kentucky Fish and Wildlife hoped this day would never come but we have been preparing for it,” Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Commissioner Rich Storm said. “Our team of experts first developed our CWD Response Plan more than 20 years ago, and it has been enhanced through the years using the best available science. “Collaboration with our many partners, including hunters, taxidermists, meat processors, diagnostic testing facilities and other government agencies has enhanced our CWD surveillance efforts.” The deer was harvested on opening day of modern gun deer season. Biologists collected tissue from the animal as part of ongoing CWD surveillance efforts. Preliminary tests were conducted at Murray State University’s Breathitt Veterinary Center, where the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) CWD test identified the sample as a suspect positive. Following its CWD Response Plan, Kentucky Fish and Wildlife immediately sent back-up samples to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa for an expedited Immunohistochemistry (IHC), which is a test that is used to detect the deposition of infectious abnormal proteins within specific cervid tissues. “Results from the IHC confirmed the results of the initial ELISA test and were reported to us on Wednesday as a CWD detection,” said Dr. Christine Casey, wildlife veterinarian with Kentucky Fish and Wildlife. “The combination of the ELISA test and IHC gives us the utmost confidence that the animal was infected with the disease.” Since its discovery in the late 1960s in Colorado, CWD has spread to more than half the states in the U.S., including six of seven Kentucky-bordering states (Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee).

Kentucky Fish and Wildlife established its CWD Response Plan after the disease was detected for the first time east of the Mississippi River, and it has evolved through the past 20-plus years. The department activated the plan in Sep. 2021 following an announcement by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency that the disease was found just across Kentucky’s southern border in northwestern Tennessee. Kentucky Fish and Wildlife subsequently established a CWD Surveillance Zone in western Kentucky, encompassing Calloway, Marshall, Graves, Fulton and Hickman counties. Special regulations remain in place for those counties. Kentucky Fish and Wildlife operated mandatory CWD check stations in the surveillance zone in 2021, 2022 and again this year during the first three days of modern gun deer season (Nov. 11-13). The department collected 1,318 samples last month at its CWD check stations in western Kentucky. Currently, it has received results from 84 percent of those samples, and 35.6 percent of results from samples collected statewide. Ballard County is adjacent to the surveillance zone. Kentucky Fish and Wildlife staff have been collecting samples from the county for many years as part of the agency’s statewide surveillance efforts, but the disease had never previously been detected. Since 2002, Kentucky Fish and Wildlife has CWD-tested more than 40,000 deer and elk from across the state, sampling every county. “Although CWD is always fatal to infected individual animals, by following best practices we can minimize its impact on the long-term health and sustainability of our deer herd so that we can continue to enjoy our deer and elk herds for many generations to come, helping to safeguard the many ways that they benefit the Commonwealth,” Storm said. With more than a month before deer hunting closes for the season in Kentucky, hunters can aid Kentucky Fish and Wildlife’s statewide monitoring efforts by donating the heads of legally harvested and tele-checked deer for CWD testing and aging through the voluntary Deer Sample Collection Station program. There is no cost to hunters. Location information, instructions and more information about the program are available online via fw.ky.gov/cwd. If a hunter-harvested deer tests positive for CWD, the hunter will be contacted upon confirmation of the disease. For the latest information on CWD, please visit the department's website (fw.ky.gov) and follow its social media channels. More information about CWD is available at fw.ky.gov/cwd, cwd-info.org and through the CDC website.

It’s the latest tranche of relief to come for Americans who already qualify for debt cancellation through programs such as income-driven repayment and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). About half of the forgiveness, $2.2 billion for about 46,000 borrowers, announced Wednesday came from what the administration referred to as “fixes” to the federal income-driven repayment process, which the department says historically hasn’t counted progress toward forgiveness accurately, leaving borrowers who’ve been paying down their loans for more than two decades unfairly on the hook. Golden tickets:Student loan debt forgiveness becomes a reality for more than 804,000 who paid for decades The rest, about $2.6 billion for more than 34,000 borrowers, was for PSLF participants − people working as teachers, public defenders and other public sector jobs − who’ve also had their repayment timelines reassessed in recent months. The Biden administration first announced in July that it would be adjusting borrowers’ accounts to make them more accurate, providing almost a million borrowers with immediate relief. A Government Accountability Office report last year found that the Education Department needed to do a better job of tracking borrowers\' payments. More than 3.6 million borrowers in total qualify to get at least three more years of payments counted toward their loan forgiveness, the department says. The department plans on notifying those eligible borrowers every other month into next year, according to its website. “This debt relief is life-changing,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said during a call with reporters on Wednesday. ""We know there are so many more student loan borrowers who have been failed by this system and still need help.” The Education Department made the announcement as Biden’s “Plan B” to bring student loan forgiveness to millions of Americans enters into a critical new phase. On Monday, the administration released its latest proposal in a monthslong negotiating effort to produce new regulations that the department hopes have a better chance at passing legal muster after the Supreme Court rebuked Biden’s first student loan relief plan in June. In the proposal, the department zeroed in on helping out longtime borrowers − those who’ve been paying back their loans for two decades and longer − as well as borrowers whose bottom lines have been crippled by interest. The administration suggested waiving up to $20,000 in debt for low- and moderate-income borrowers whose balances have ballooned past the amount they originally took out. To be eligible for the relief, Americans who are single must make less than $125,000 and be enrolled in income-driven loan repayment plans. Yet even without meeting those qualifications, relief up to $10,000 past borrowers’ original loan amounts could be possible. Biden made a campaign promise to forgive student loan debt on a wide scale. With that plan upended, the administration has made a point to showcase smaller tranches of forgiveness, which now total $132 billion for several million borrowers. Latest student debt forgiveness proposalBiden\'s plan would help borrowers with old loans, ballooning interest The agency’s final round of policy negotiations is slated for next week. A major focus will be outstanding questions about how to determine what kinds of “hardships” − chronic illness or bankruptcy, for example − could make borrowers eligible for special relief.
