antisemitism on college campuses continues to play out at Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania. Over the weekend, Penn President Liz Magill resignedafter calls mounted for her removal among students, faculty and donors. All eyes then turned to Harvard — which announced on Tuesday that its president, Claudine Gay, will keep her job amid intense pressure. Critics say Magill, Gay and MIT president Sally Kornbluth failed to convince Congress and the public that they can adequately protect their Jewish students. Those concerns largely erupted after the university presidents were asked whether ""calling for the genocide of Jews"" would violate their school\'s code of conduct. Many felt their answers were too legalistic and lacked moral clarityat a time when both antisemitism and anti-Arab and anti-Muslim incidents are on the rise in the country. But not everyone is in favor of their departure. A growing number of students and faculty oppose the calls for the presidents to go, arguing that such measures go against school values around independence and freedom speech. Here\'s what to know: On Monday, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., told Morning Edition that he supported Gay\'s removal. ""This wasn\'t the first incident,"" he said. ""Despite the fact that these incidents have been brought to the attention of the president of Harvard and the other presidents, there\'s been no action."" Gottheimer was one of the 74 members of Congress who signed a letter last week urging the governing boards of Harvard, Penn and MIT to remove their presidents. Congress continues to investigate their policies and disciplinary procedures. In an open letter on Sunday night to Harvard\'s governing boards, alum and billionaire investor Bill Ackman also accused of Gay damaging the university\'s reputation. ""Knowing what we know now, would Harvard consider Claudine Gay for the position? The answer is definitively \'No,\'"" he wrote, adding that the decision of whether to fire Gay ""could not be more straightforward. Earlier on Sunday, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who posed the question around the schools\' code of conduct, ominously wrote on X: ""One down. Two to go."" She added, ""@Harvard and @MIT, do the right thing. The world is watching."" On Monday, the executive committee of the Harvard Alumni Association expressed its support for Gay and asked the university\'s governing boards to publicly do the same. ""President Gay is the right leader to guide the University during this challenging time,"" the committee wrote. ""We are confident President Gay will address antisemitism, and other forms of hate, effectively and courageously."" Similarly, over the weekend, more than 650 Harvard faculty members signed a letter to the university\'s top governing board, urging it to keep Gay as president, The Harvard Crimson reported. They stressed that yielding to such political pressures is at odds with the school\'s values around academic freedom. ""The critical work of defending a culture of free inquiry in our diverse community cannot proceed if we let its shape be dictated by outside forces,"" they wrote, according to The Crimson. At MIT, the university\'s board said last week it stood by Kornbluth, adding that it has faith in her leadership, judgement and moral compass. ""She has done excellent work in leading our community, including in addressing antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hate, all of which we reject utterly at MIT,"" the MIT Corporation wroteon Thursday. ""She has our full and unreserved support."" College campuses have long been a flashpoint for political controversies but the turmoil unfolding on school grounds over the Israel-Hamas war is also unprecedented in many ways. Angus Johnston, a historian of American student activism at Hostos Community College of The City University of New York, said no issue in recent decades has divided student activists within the same school like the Israel-Hamas conflict. ""It is rare for there to be simultaneous protests on many American campuses where students are taking diametrically opposed positions,"" he said. That\'s not only a challenge to navigate for peers, but also for university presidents, who are balancing the interests of students, faculty, donors and even lawmakers. ""The presidents of MIT, Harvard and UPenn were under fire in a tense, polarized Congressional hearing. That\'s a unique and different environment for most college presidents,"" said Jason Shepard, a communications professor at California State University, Fullerton. He added that the current political climate is also complicated by social media, which can produce viral moments and knee jerk reactions. ""Ten-second snippets of viral videos can move like wildfire, and this sets up a whole new world for university presidents to effectively communicate with a broad and diverse range of constituencies,"" Shepard said. This moment in higher education might become even more perilous with the fall of another university president, Johnston said.

I\'m Tonya Mosley. As the nation gears up for the 2024 presidential election, former President Donald Trump faces 91 felony charges across four criminal cases. He\'s also ahead in the polls, well ahead by the double digits against his Republican opponents and even ahead of President Biden in several polls. During a town hall on Fox News last week, commentator Sean Hannity asked Trump about concerns that if reelected, he would be a more radical and authoritarian leader this time around. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SEAN HANNITY: The media has been focused on this and attacking you. DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. HANNITY: Under no circumstances - you are promising America tonight you would never abuse power as retribution against anybody. TRUMP: Except for Day 1. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah. HANNITY: Except for... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: He\'s going crazy. TRUMP: Except for Day 1. HANNITY: Meaning? TRUMP: I want to close the border, and I want to drill. He says, you\'re not going to be a dictator, are you? I said, no, no, no, other than Day 1. We\'re closing the border, and we\'re drilling, drilling, drilling. After that I\'m not a dictator. HANNITY: Well, that... MOSLEY: That was former President Trump on Fox News, speaking at a town hall with Sean Hannity. Our guest today, Charlie Savage, writes about presidential power as well as security and legal policy for The New York Times. He\'s written two books about presidential power. The first is ""Takeover: The Return Of The Imperial Presidency And The Subversion Of American Democracy,"" which he wrote in 2007. It\'s about the Bush-Cheney administration\'s efforts to expand presidential power. He\'s also written a book called ""Power Wars: The Relentless Rise Of Presidential Authority And Secrecy,"" which is a book about Obama\'s post-9/11 presidency. Charlie Savage, welcome to FRESH AIR. CHARLIE SAVAGE: Thank you for having me on. MOSLEY: OK, so Trump is running again. He has a very busy trial schedule coming up in 2024 because in addition to running a presidential campaign, he has 91 charges across four criminal cases. And they include 44 federal charges and 47 state charges, all of them felonies. And we should say that Trump has denied wrongdoing in each case. But can you lay out for us how relentless these court proceedings could turn out to be? Because, like, just looking at the docket, for instance, the Iowa caucuses begin on January 15th and then on the 16th is a federal civil trial in Manhattan. SAVAGE: That\'s right. One of the ways in which this upcoming election is going to be unlike anything we\'ve seen before is how interwoven it\'s going to be with proceedings in court against Mr. Trump. He is, as you said, facing four separate trials - two over his - the events leading to the January 6 riot at the Capitol and his attempts to overturn the election, one in Georgia and one in here in Washington, D.C., one in Florida over his hoarding of classified documents and refusal to turn them back into the government even after he was subpoenaed for them, and then a case in state court in Manhattan over falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. And that\'s before we get to the civil cases against him. He\'s going to need to be in the courtroom for those cases. If those things get to trial, that is going to intersect and collide with the campaign calendar. His ability to be holding rallies in Iowa and New Hampshire and other states is affected by his need to be in a courtroom. He cannot be in two places at once. And that\'s one of several ways, I think, in which, assuming he does win the Republican nomination, as he - polls certainly suggests he\'s on track to doing, this is going to be a very strange election. MOSLEY: OK, let\'s get into some of your reporting, which has been looking at the various ways Trump wants to expand executive power should he become president. We can see, through his agenda for a second term, a lot of what he\'s been talking about is a promise of retribution and revenge. Most notably, he wants revenge against President Biden. What are some of the ways he\'s saying this retribution could look like? SAVAGE: So what you\'re talking about is a series that I and two of my colleagues, Jonathan Swan and Maggie Haberman, have been working on since June. And its origin story is that, in fact, Trump\'s comments about vengeance and President Biden. But the series more broadly is about trying to look past the politics and the - you know, the odds of who\'s going to win in the moment into the policy stakes of what would happen starting in 2025 if former President Trump becomes the president again. So we had been collectively doing a ton of reporting already on the infrastructure around Trump, planning and thinking for a second term if there was one, and how he has a much more developed and sophisticated policy apparatus backing him than he ever had before. And that\'s when in June, Trump came out and said bombastically that he was going to appoint a real special prosecutor to go after Biden and his family. And, you know, most people sort of dismiss this as just more sort of Trump bombast. But in our notebook was a lot of material about how actually there were people in Trump\'s orbits, including the guy he wanted to make the next attorney general, who had been working away at developing the constitutional analysis to erase the traditional independence of the Justice Department from White House control over investigative decisions and to really lay the groundwork for there to be substance and action behind these things that Trump was saying he intended to do. So that became our first story, about the Trump\'s promise to end the post-Watergate norm of Justice Department independence and the - how there was really meat behind these comments he was making. But as we got further into it, we realized that that\'s just one of many ways in which the things that he is saying he\'s going to do are worthy of attention and much more likely to happen in a second Trump term than maybe they were in the first term, in which things were much more haphazard and there were greater constraints restraining what Trump was able to do when he wanted to have some of these impulses. MOSLEY: Let\'s stay on the Justice Department for a second. He is pretty focused because he believes that the department has been weaponized against him. You mentioned a person that he\'s eyeing for attorney general should he become president again. But what other types of people would he likely staff in the Justice Department a second go-round? SAVAGE: Well, one of the things that we\'ve been writing about is how the constraints that kept President Trump in his term in office from going all the way in what he was trying to do, including in the space of pushing the Justice Department to prosecute his political adversaries, which he tried over and over to do in his first term, and - but failed to do. The Justice Department opened investigations into people like John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, former FBI Director James Comey, Andy McCabe and others, but did not end up bringing charges against them, to his fury. This helped lead in 2020 to the schism between Trump and then-Attorney General William Barr. And part of the reason for that was that throughout the Trump administration, there were lawyers, who were very conservative people, members of the Federalist Society, etc., but who also were willing to raise legal objections to some of what Trump was pushing the administration to do, not just in this Justice Department context, but in immigration control and others, that were saying, that - we can do this much, but that would be illegal. We can\'t do that. And the people around - who have remained in Trump\'s orbit, who did not break with him after the events of January 6, who have been out in think tanks, well-funded think tanks, developing this policymaking apparatus we were discussing, have also been vetting lawyers for a second Trump administration with this in mind. They are determined not to have the sort of lawyer who might resist something that Trump or his senior White House advisers want to do, who might raise legal objections, as some of these political appointees did last time, so that they can actually carry out and achieve some of these ideas. And these ideas very much include directing prosecutions out of the White House that may actually result in charges that did not happen the last cycle. And Trump and the people around him are openly saying this. So these stories we\'ve'}]"
