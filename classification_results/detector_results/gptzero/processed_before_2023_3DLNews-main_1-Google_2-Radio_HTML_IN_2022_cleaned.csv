Sycamore Land Trust is a nonprofit foundation that works to protect southern Indiana land and natural habitats. We protect land and restore natural habitat: Sycamore protects land by owning and caring for nature preserves, and by holding conservation easements that protect privately owned properties. We acquire land through donations, purchases, and bargain sales (partial donations). Stewardship of our nature preserves includes restoration projects to improve natural habitat, and building and maintaining trails for free public use. Sycamore now protects 128 properties totaling 10,763 acres in southern Indiana. They currently serve southern Indiana from Morgan County south to the Ohio River. In 2022 the Sycamore Land Trust worked on a really unique project, the Beanblossom Creek Wildlife Camera Project where they set up motion-triggered wildlife cameras throughout the region to capture some of Indiana's diverse wildlife. Over the past year, the trail cameras captured over 40 different animal species just north of Bloomington. The footage they caught is absolutely incredible! You can check out the video below, where you'll see everything from bobcats, to deer, to beavers, and birds. It's truly fascinating. I mean, have you ever seen a beaver build a dam? Now you can say you have! If you'd like to support the Sycamore Land Trust and the work that they do to protect land and natural habitats around southern Indiana, you can make a donation to them, here.
