She is third from the left in the front row of contestants geared up for gladiator matches. The latest episode of “The Bachelor” aired Feb. 12 and saw Erwin native Jessica Edwards and the other ladies traveling to the Republic of Malta, an island country in southern Europe on the Mediterranean Sea, with this season’s “bachelor” Joey Graziadei. Once on the island, the ladies prepped for a gladiator-style battle for the attention of Graziadei. Hometown contestant Jessica Edwards was not victorious in the battle, but she did enjoy some one-on-one time with Graziadei. “The Bachelor” super fan Olivia Blevins said, “Last night’s episode was pretty drama filled, but Jess seems to be staying out of it, which is good idea.” The episode also allowed for some personal growth. “She got to be open and transparent with Joey about how she is starting to fall for him,” Blevins said. In turn, Blevins said that Graziadei also appeared open and happy to hear about Edwards’ feelings. Edwards’ mother, Kristie Ledford, got to watch her daughter on television for another week. “I think Jessica did great in Monday night’s episode,” said Ledford. “The sausage and cheese game was hysterical.” Ledford noted that her daughter confided that the game “was so gross” after the meat and cheese had been in the hot sun. Ledford said that her daughter said that the smell of the sausage and cheese was just terrible. Ledford said that her daughter grabbed one with her hand (which was against the rules) and told Graziadei that she was sorry and that it would be the only time she would ever cheat. Sadly, Jessica’s cheeky comment to the bachelor was cut from the episode. Ledford said that her daughter confided to her that she had no intention of putting any of that food in her mouth. Ledford added that many other family members are cheering on her daughter. “Her dad, Will Edwards, an Erwin native as well, is watching with some friends at the Union Street Taproom weekly viewing party, and is very proud of her and loves watching his little girl on TV.” Other members of Edwards’ family are enjoying the show, with her first cousins Vince and Zach, watching in California.

The Williamson County planning department is holding a series of community meetings to help determine how Arrington will handle future developments and other growth. As the county prepares for projected growth in the Arrington area over the next several years, officials are seeking input on the process from residents and community members. Citizens are invited to the first open house of the Arrington Special Area Plan process on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. at Arrington Elementary School. Williamson County planning coordinator Aaron Holmes said this first meeting will mainly serve as an introduction between the community and the county staff and advisory committee. The full process will consist of many meetings and opportunities for public input over the following months resulting in a comprehensive plan for handling future developments and other growth. “The open house is simply for the staff and advisory committee to introduce ourselves to the area and then go over the planning process of how we will create the plan,” Holmes said. The county relies on feedback from residents to shape the plan, so Holmes said the process will continually evolve. “We go in with no preconceived notions of what the plan would be or will look like at the end,” Holmes said. “We depend upon the public and their input to help drive and develop the plan.” Citizens from all backgrounds and opinions are encouraged to attend these meetings and speak up. While the plan is made to address growth, it doesn’t necessarily have to welcome it. “This is not to encourage growth or to open a door to growth; what the county is trying to do is provide a plan if growth came,” explained Ginger Shirling, an Arrington resident and advisory board member for the recent Triune Special Area Plan. In her experience with Triune’s process, Shirling said she was impressed with the county’s willingness to accept and work toward residents’ desires. “Our planning department takes the neighborhoods’ comments very seriously and they alter the plans accordingly,” Shirling said. She hopes residents from all sides of the issue participate so the county can reach a middle-ground. “If we participate in the special plan for Arrington then we have a chance of the plan coming out to suit a lot of people,” Shirling said. She and another resident, Deborah Bell, don’t want growth coming to Arrington, but if it does they want a process in place to control it. “Our expectations are realistic; we know [the area] is growing,” Bell said. She said the end goal of the Arrington Special Area Plan should be smart growth — but that will only happen with robust ideas and conversations. Thursday’s meeting will be an hour-long meet-and-greet for citizens to drop in, meet the people who will be leading the project and get the ball rolling, said Holmes. Future meetings will be announced through Williamson County, but citizens can reach out to Holmes at aaron.holmes@williamsoncounty-tn.gov with questions. Log In Keep it Clean.

Wilder said the federal policy that SB1738 fights against would create protections for these children, so they don’t end up in and out of the foster care system repeatedly. The federal policy would do this by sending them to a home that would support their identity on the first try. “What this bill is trying to say is not only do you not have to do that, but actually that the foster parent has the right to discriminate against that child,” Wilder said. “Which goes against the DCS policy that the child’s best interest comes first.” Wilder said the bill could also inadvertently affect religious freedom due to its phrasing, which details how the parent can use a religious or moral belief as justification. He said this wording could also work to, for example, allow atheist parents to prevent Christian children from worshiping in their atheist home. “This could just create a cycle of bullying within itself and open up a whole [other] chapter … of legislation or TCA, to say that these parents don’t have to comply with DCS code,” Wilder said. “That they, as long as they have a moral belief or religious freedom reason, can abuse that to hurt a child.” Wilder said that TEP hopes to have state representatives listen to the stories of some of the people in the community they would be affecting. “What they’re obviously not hearing and have not taken the time to do is hear from the LGBTQ kids, and families that are going to be affected by this legislation.” Copyright 2024, TN TRIBUNE, all rights reserved. “Honestly I was mortified,” said Jace Wilder, of the Tennessee Equality Project. “It is one thing to go after the community in general, it is one thing to go after adults. But it is another thing to go after the livelihood of foster children who are already in very sensitive situations that need our protection and need our comfort.” Wilder said as an Education Manager, he does a lot of teaching about the trans experience and advocacy with individuals, media, and state legislators. What makes him especially vocal about this bill however is his history in health policy and LGBTQ+ research TEP.

Now, with the Carousel s… To the Editor: To the Editor: Staff Writer At a work session Tuesday, the Franklin Board of Mayor and Aldermen discussed erecting three markers memorializing African American lynching victims from Reconstruction and Jim Crow era in Williamson County. The Williamson Remembers Committee — consisting of community members including Franklin Tomorrow Executive Director Mindy Tate, African American Heritage Society President Alma McLemore, Franklin Mayor Ken Moore and Chris Williamson of the Fuller Story — advocates for one marker to be placed in Franklin’s square and two near Bicentennial Park on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue. Attorney Julian Bibb and the Rev. Kenneth Hill, pastor at Shorter Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, co-chair the committee. Hill, alongside Center for Historic Preservation Director Carroll Van West and Lamont Turner, a community advocate, spoke to the aldermen to gain input and support. “Freedom for enslaved people spurred by federal edict, military might and the courageous exertions of an oppressed population itself led to a fresh establishment of democracy that racist autocrats tried to thwart,” Hill said. “The lynching of innocent African Americans was the tragic and bitter fruit of this subversion that denied full participation in the democratic process.

Brown specifically questioned the markers near Bicentennial, saying it might be better to place them closer within walking distance of the square and move them to fit more in a historical context with surrounding historical sites. Moore reminded him that there were historical sites near the markers’ planned location, such as historic cemeteries and the proximity to the historic Hard Bargain neighborhood. Wording on the markers tells the history and stories of specific lynching victims and also the prevalence of lynching in America in the years after the Civil War. “Denied free and impartial trials, too many Black citizens became victims of White lynch mobs,” part of the first marker reads. “Lynchings of African Americans were one of the most public and brutal forms of racial terrorism. Across the United States, at least 4,000 such lynchings occurred. Williamson County did not escape this brutal period in history. Racially motivated lynchings, murder and violence targeted Black residents. The Remembrance Project believes that by confronting with honesty this history, our community will be stronger and more united in its quest for Liberty and Justice for All.” BOMA will vote on the markers at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

the December 2021 tornado about the recovery process over the past two years. Following are their stories, which they share in hopes of lifting spirits and sustaining hope for the continued long-term recovery in Dresden. Paul and Sharon Ricketts were at home on Hyland Street when the tornado of December 2021 hit Dresden. “We were in the hallway,” Paul said. “Our sons and some neighbors came to check on us that night.” A few days after the tornado hit, Tommy and Karen Wilson coordinated tree removal from Ricketts’ yard. The Ricketts hired a private contractor in an attempt to repair their home but were unable to get any work completed over the next seven months. The couple expressed their frustration about the lack of progress and support from the city during this time. “It was distressing,” Sharon said, her voice filled with emotion. “Frozen pipes, no heat, bathroom unusable.” Then Paul and Sharon were contacted by James Simone, a case manager with the Tennessee Western Kentucky United Methodist Church (TWKUMC) Disaster Recovery Network, following a referral from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). “If it wasn’t for James and his organization (TWKUMC), we would have nothing,” Paul said. “Shannon Hayes and James – if it wasn’t for them, we’d have no hope.” Local contractor Shannon Hayes was willing to take on the construction work to build a new home for the couple, rotating crews to fit the project into his already loaded schedule. “We’re still waiting to see what we will need from the new house. I’ve made it to 78 years without asking for too much help. There should be people willing to help,” said Paul. Paul and Sharon expressed their gratitude for the monetary support received from the Dresden Church of Christ, the Greenfield Church of Christ, and Hatler’s Chapel Church of Christ. “The Macedonia Church of Christ, they brought heaters. Jamie Smith with Smith & Sons brought window unit air conditioners. We got mattresses and box springs from the Dresden Church of Christ.” Paul also had praise for Micah Seavers, owner of Seavers Beavers and Southern Reds BBQ. “Micheal Seavers, he brought propane to us and other people all winter long. He brought tons of propane.” When asked what advice they would share with someone else, facing a situation like theirs, Paul and Sharon had the following words. “First of all, don’t worry. There will be people to help,” said Sharon. “And thank God you’re here,” added Paul. “Material things can be replaced. We’ve had people call, asking what can we do? What do you need? Larry Levister has been real good about that. Also Brent and Cynthia Melton, Mark Melton - he always said that there was money when we needed it.” “I just feel so grateful, so blessed, even now.” -Deborah Simmons A grandmother of five and a great grandmother of one, Deborah Simmons has lived in the home built by her husband since 1998. On the night of December 10th, 2021, she was alone when the tornado made its way through Dresden. “It was scary, loud. There was debris all in the yard and I had no idea where it was from. I don’t know where my stuff went. But I just feel so grateful, so blessed, even now.” The storm shifted Simmons' house off its foundation, resulting in water damage and mold. She said her physical and mental health have deteriorated due to the stress of the living conditions. A contractor from Mississippi started work on the house, then disappeared. Then the Tennessee Western Kentucky United Methodist Church (TWKUMC) Disaster Recovery Network case management team worked with their contractor to attempt repair of the original home but were unsuccessful. Simmons is now counting down the days until her move into her new home which is on the same plot of land where she has lived for the past twenty-five years. Despite the struggles, Simmons remains positive. When asked about the people who have supported her through the recovery process, Simmons had a long list. “The recovery process has been amazing with the kindest people I've ever met. Volunteers cleaned my yard. There were four trees down and they took a tree off my shed. A church van full of teenagers arrived and the kids just flooded out. People are raising their children right, they're very compassionate,” said Simmons. She described her daughter as her best friend who is always there to hold her hand. She described her Tennessee Western Kentucky United Methodist Church (TWKUMC) Disaster Recovery Network case manager, James Simone, as “so knowledgeable and kind, he goes above and beyond.” Simmons also expressed her gratitude for the assistance she received from the workers with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Compass82. Simmons stated how she knew long-term recovery was just that - long term. She said living as a disaster survivor requires patience with yourself and with the people helping you. Her advice to others starting their path on the road to recovery after a disaster would be to rely on prayer. “People will be supporting you, you'll feel like you've got an army supporting you,” said Simmons. “No matter what, count your blessings. You’re not alone. Your friends and family will show up – people will come by and deliver. I can’t even remember everyone who helped.” -Marva Brock When the tornado of December 10, 2021, hit Dresden, the Stephenson home was right in its path. The family was gathered in their home watching over a sleeping grandbaby. Trees fell on both sides of the house. Rain poured through the gaps, resulting in extensive water damage. Marva Brock recalled how she had to move her sister to Van Ayer Manor in Martin that same night, but she expressed how thankful the family is to have avoided physical injuries. Brock’s brother and nephew now live in the home, which has been converted into two apartments. The house was built in the 1900s and its uniquely sized windows had to be specially ordered. “We’re just waiting on the windows to arrive so we can finish up,” said Brock. Tennessee Western Kentucky United Methodist Church (TWKUMC) Disaster Recovery Network has worked with the Brock family to repair their home and replace appliances, heaters, and household items. Brock was moved by all the support offered to her family. Coworkers at the Union City candle distribution center offered money for cleanup. Bell Farms provided monetary support. Her niece worked at the Paris Wal-Mart and its management team donated a gift certificate. House in a Box provided a bed and bedframe. “The Dresden Elks Lodge was wonderful providing food. The First Baptist volunteers provided labor and food. The volunteer group cut up the trees,” said Brock. Brock was also effusive in her praise for local first responders and utility workers. “The police, gas, electric, phone – they were working around the clock. Everything was back on quickly and they would check and recheck. The local and state essential workers were very prepared.” “Trust in the Lord to help and have patience. The Lord will pull you through everything. Rely on your family and friends.” These words represent the wisdom Anna Hammonds would share with a survivor just starting on their path to recovery. When the tornado of December 2021 hit Dresden, David and Anna Hammonds were living in the house that had belonged to David’s grandparents. In an instant, they lost the home they loved and wondered how they would recover. They have been working through the case management process with the Tennessee Western Kentucky United Methodist Church (TWKUMC) Disaster Recovery Network over the past two years with their assigned case manager, James Simone. “If it wasn’t for James getting in touch with us, we would not have our wonderful home,” said Anna. Since the tornado, David and Anna experience anxiety during every storm. Anna says they are particularly nervous about trees. They’ve moved three times over the past two years as they worked through the case management process. The love and support shown by their community has been overwhelming. “I had friends come to help pack up the belongings that survived the storm. They were so thoughtful,” said Anna. “My friend Renza Adams went to buy clothing for me at Southern Grace in Dresden, and DeDe Meeks wouldn’t let her pay. DeDe sent several bags of clothing.” Anna also described the support from her classmates in the Dresden High School class of 1975. “Joan Hodges hosted a party and there was a money tree. It was over $400 from my friends. Joy Adams was so good to check on me.” Anna also expressed a special appreciation for the contributions from Tommy Wilson, Mike Wilson, Paula Robertson, and Joann Wireman for their help from the very start of the Hammonds’ recovery process. David and Anna are grateful to all the organizations and people who have supported them during their recovery journey.""}]"

(AP) — The man accused of killing a Tennessee deputy and wounding another during a traffic stop last week made his first court appearance Thursday. Kenneth Wayne DeHart Jr., 42, was arraigned but has not yet entered a plea on charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and being a felon in possession of a weapon, news outlets reported. Blount Sessions Court Judge William K. Brewer assigned the public defender\'s office to represent DeHart when the defendant said he did not have a lawyer. The public defender\'s office did not immediately respond to a call on whether DeHart had been assigned a lawyer. DeHart was arrested Tuesday in Knoxville after a five-day search. He is accused of fatally shooting Blount County Deputy Greg McCowan, 43, and wounding Deputy Shelby Eggers, 22, during a traffic stop last week, authorities have said. Deputies had initiated a stop on suspicion of erratic driving and the driver was identified by authorities as DeHart. He refused to get out of the SUV, and a stun gun was used to no effect, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said in a statement. The driver produced a gun and fired shots, striking both deputies, the statement said. At least one deputy returned fire and DeHart drove off, it said. At McCowan\'s funeral, he was remembered for his service to others even before following his dream to become a law enforcement officer. ""If you were in harm\'s way, he would stand in harm\'s way for you even before he became a police officer. That was just Greg,"" friend Greg Willis said. ""He went out doing what he loved. That was his dream to be a police officer. What more could you ask for (than) to go out doing what you love?"" Blount County Sheriff James Lee Berrong also spoke about McCowan\'s desire to serve the community. The deputy began his career in law enforcement in 2020 after graduating from a training class and was commended in 2021 for helping save the life of a man trapped in a burning vehicle.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 4:32 am Reporter Harry Barrett, a Vietnam veteran and Purple Heart recipient, stands at a crossing which will be named after him on Carters Valley Road. SURGOINSVILLE — The Hawkins County Commission voted at its last meeting to name a portion of Carters Valley Road after a longtime county resident, Vietnam veteran and Purple Heart recipient. The commission discussed the resolution at its regularly scheduled meeting on Jan. 22. The Harry S. Barrett Crossing will be a portion of Carters Valley Road near its intersection with Amis Chapel Road, where the road crosses over a creek. Harry Barrett, 74, grew up in Hawkins County. He was drafted into the Army and served in Vietnam as part of the 9th Infantry Division for about two years until he was medically discharged in 1971 after being shot in the right arm. Barrett received the Purple Heart, which is a high honor given to service members who are wounded or killed while serving in the military. District Four Commissioner Josh Gilliam sponsored the resolution. “I think vets have given the greatest sacrifice of anyone, and I want to do anything and everything I can for the people who have fought for our country,” Gillam said. “So, when I was approached about this, it was important to me that we honor him, especially since he is a Purple Heart recipient.” District Three Commissioner Danny Alvis is a longtime friend of Barrett. He said he wants to honor vets while they are around to appreciate it. “It was deserving,” Alvis said. “I respect all veterans. I’m 72 years old, and most of the veterans we’re doing this for are older than I am. So, they’re not gonna be here forever, and I would love to recognize veterans while they’re alive, and they can see this.” Barrett said when Alvis told him about the resolution, he thought he was joking. “I’m real proud of it,” Barrett said. “That was really nice of them to name it after me.” When the resolution went before the commissioner, District Six Commissioner Nancy Barker made a motion to send it to the road committee for approval. Gilliam told the commission that he checked with the E-911 director and that renaming the crossing shouldn’t interfere with emergency services.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Kenneth Wayne DeHart Jr., the man accused of killing a Blount County deputy and injuring another, was captured Feb. 13 in Knoxville, the Blount County Sheriff\'s Office announced. Detectives tracked DeHart\'s cellphone during the manhunt, and eventually their work led them to a home on Linden Avenue in Knoxville\'s Park City neighborhood. When they saw him step outside, they moved in using flash-bangs, partially to freeze a dog at the house. DeHart surrendered with his hands up, police said, and he was arrested about 3:20 p.m. Officers from the Blount County Sheriff\'s Office, Knox County Sheriff\'s Office, Knoxville Police Department, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Marshals Service were on the scene with tactical gear and vehicles. No one was hurt. DeHart was booked in a Blount County jail at the same time Deputy Greg McCowan\'s friends and family were mourning him a few miles away at Sevier Heights Baptist Church. DeHart was moved to an undisclosed facility outside of Blount County after he was booked so that he was in custody of authorities not connected to the sheriff\'s office. “He killed one of my deputies,"" Sheriff James Berrong explained. ""I didn’t want any appearance that if something happened it was at our fault or our doing.” DeHart was wanted on charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and being a felon in possession of a weapon. Just before 8:30 p.m. Feb. 8, McCowan and deputy Shelby Eggers tried to stop his SUV in on Sevierville Road in Maryville, a release from TBI said, and DeHart shot both deputies. The Blount County DA will determine in the coming weeks, in consultation with McCowan\'s family, whether to pursue the death penalty. “I want the death penalty. I want to go,” Berrong said after the arrest. Investigators think DeHart could have used multiple vehicles to get around after he ran from the shooting scene the night of Feb. 8. He was traced in several counties and may have left Tennessee at some point, perhaps into Georgia. Police say the home where he was arrested, about 15 miles north of where the shooting occurred, didn\'t belong to him. Investigators will continue to look into whether he had any help along the way. His brother and girlfriend are facing charges that they helped him escape. ""He may have been in and out of that location (the house) a few times during the five days and then reappeared back there today. We’re not totally sure how long he was there today when this happened. We actually do not think that he was probably at that house that long today,” said U.S. Marshal David Jolley. Thousands of tips came in, Berrong said, but the $100,000 reward likely won\'t be paid out because none led police to the house where DeHart was found. At the Blount County Justice Center in Maryville, on East Lamar Alexander Parkway, McCowan\'s cruiser was on display, almost unrecognizable beneath mounds of flowers and handwritten notes. Just steps away, veteran Patrick Barlow paid his respects by holding an American flag on the sidewalk for those passing by. He planned his arrival and departure around a shift change so more law enforcement officers could see his message. “This man’s family shared him with us,” he told Knox News. “This isn’t about me. … Every vehicle, if they’re using this entrance and exit, they’re getting a salute because it might be family or it might be the janitor or something, but it takes everybody.” Moments later, people nearby received a cellphone news alert: DeHart has been located. Audible cheers erupted from across the street at Blount Memorial Hospital. A funeral service with police honors for McCowan will take place at 1 p.m. Feb. 14 at Sevier Heights Baptist Church, 3140 Maloney Road in Knoxville. Following the funeral, which should end between 2:30-3 p.m., there will be a funeral procession from Sevier Heights Baptist Church to Grandview Cemetery at 2304 Tuckaleechee Pike in Maryville. The procession will take Alcoa Highway southbound to Hall Road in Blount County, and then to Tuckaleechee Pike in Maryville and end at Grandview Cemetery. Community members are welcome to stand in a safe spot along the route.'}]"

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 4:29 am Mark and Jenna Lafever stand on the steps of their downtown business, Plant Palace Florist and Gifts. With the annual arrival of Valentine’s Day, love is definitely in the air. One Erwin couple, who are also the owners of a downtown business, has a special love story that blossomed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mark and Jenna Lafever, owners of Plant Palace Florist and Gifts, were introduced by a mutual friend who would later serve as one of Mark’s co-best men for the couple’s wedding. Mark noted that they tied the knot during the COVID-19 pandemic. “We had a private ceremony for immediate family at a friend’s home in the mountains of Unicoi County,” he said. The newlyweds held a larger celebration a year later at the Waterstone Venue in Gray. One of the first of their joint ventures as a couple was their purchase of the Plant Palace from Harry and Teresa Lewis, who had owned and operated the business for nearly 30 years. “We enjoy working together and knew it would take both of us to be successful, and it is a constant juggling act,” Mark added. Lafever noted that they have great employees on their side who are always willing to provide great customer service. He said that his employees deserve accolades for their efforts. So, is Valentine’s Day the top holiday for a floral business? “Valentine’s Day is big, but I would say Mother’s Day is a very close second,” he said. “Being a full-service florist and gift shop, we have days that feel like Valentine’s Day in July,” he added. The Lafevers will celebrate Valentine’s Day at Plant Palace helping their employees get all the orders out the door. Afterward, Mark and Jenna said that they plan to take a long weekend for some much-needed rest. Plant Place Florist and Gifts is located at 123 N. Main Ave. in Downtown Erwin. Hours of operation are Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday from 9 a.m to 1 p.m. The business is closed on Sundays. The phone number is (423) 743-3301.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 3:25 am The Lebanon Democrat is beginning the process of running question-and-answer profiles of the Wilson County educators who have been selected as the teacher of the year in their respective schools. Those individuals, from the Wilson County School System and the Lebanon Special School District (in addition to two of the county’s private schools), are in contention for the Wilson County Teacher of the Year Award, which will be announced later this spring. The series of profiles continues with a glance at Madison Lien, a Exceptional Education Kindergarten and 2nd grade ELA and Math teacher at West Elementary School... Name: Madison Lien School: West Elementary School Age: 38 What grade/subject do you teach (of course, this will vary depending on whether you teach at the elementary, middle school or high school level)? Exceptional Education Kindergarten and 2nd grade (ELA and Math, but I also am the case manager for all Exceptional Education students in these grades). How long have you been in education (total years)? 14 How many years have you taught at your current school? 8 What other schools have you taught at prior to your current school? Carroll-Oakland Elementary What is something unique about you — whether it’s a hobby, skill or past accomplishment — that most people likely wouldn’t be aware of? I am the crazy Harry Potter teacher at our school, as it is a huge obsession of mine. Over the years, I have been slowly trying to transform my room to look as though it’s from Hogwarts, including my room number being changed to 9 ¾. What do you enjoy doing in your free time (hobbies, etc.)? Outside of school, I enjoy crafting, baking, spending time with my husband and two boys, and watching movies. I’m also a fan of cringe-worthy puns and love a good school dress-up day! Those closest to me would tell you if you can’t find me at school, I am probably either at Burn Boot Camp or in the aisles of ALDI. Is there anything unique about your teaching situation that you’d like to detail? I am fortunate to be part of a school team that I truly feel stands above the rest in our ability to enact change and progress with our exceptional education students. How would you describe your teaching style? I set high expectations for my students, no matter what their abilities are. My students know that they are expected to do their best, whatever that looks like for them. That being said, I am also not afraid to be silly, over-the-top, and “extra” to make my kids laugh and be engaged in what we are doing. Could you share a couple of strategies for how to keep students engaged and motivated? As stated above, you pretty much have to leave your pride at the door! In all seriousness, kids don’t want to learn anything from someone that they don’t like or that they think doesn’t like them, and they can sense the authenticity of how you feel about them. If you are excited to teach, and truly value them, that energy can be the best motivator. I also really like to draw and like to incorporate student interests into individualized drawing and things for them to work for so they can value the personal aspect of something uniquely made for them. Have you ever encountered a challenge in teaching that required you to rethink your teaching methods and/or approach? Every year. Every Month. Every Day. With my students, challenging behaviors and learning disabilities are unique to each student. What works one day likely won’t work the next. However, there is great validation and growth in being able to accept that challenge every day and grow right alongside my students as we figure out together how to move forward in the best possible ways, both behaviorally and academically. What is different, unique and/or enjoyable about the school that you are currently teaching at? The best things about my school are my people. The kids that make the job interesting and challenging and hilarious every day. My Ex. Ed. team is truly that — a team. We support each other, day in and day out, to do the best we can for our students. My gen ed teachers are unmatched in their ability to jump in and collaborate, include, celebrate, and pivot at a moment’s notice. Lastly, I’m incredibly fortunate enough to have parents that are engaged in the process and approach our plans as a collaborative, respectful team. Why did you choose teaching as a career path? As the daughter of a special education teacher of 42 years, this was honestly the last job I thought I would have. However, in the interim from undergraduate to graduate school, I subbed and worked in a pre-K classroom focused primarily for students’ with more severe disabilities and learning deficits. I fell in love with it and never looked back. What is the most fulfilling part of teaching? Honestly, feeling like I actually make a positive impact in another person’s life. Whether that is a student, a fellow teacher, or a parent, the moments where you can really see a change are immeasurably moving. What is the most challenging part of teaching? Finding the time to do everything you need and want to do while also maintaining the balance between home life and school life. How has your view of teaching changed since you first embarked on your teaching career? I feel like I have more of an understanding of just how valuable each and every year is and what limited time we have to make an impact. This is also probably, in large part, to the fact that I am also now a parent as well as a teacher. How have you seen the profession change over the course of your career, and how do you see it continuing to evolve going forward? Each year, I feel like more and more is asked of teachers because we will rise to the occasion and do what is best for our students, regardless of the ask. While that is undoubtedly an incredible descriptor overall for a profession and one I am proud to adhere to, I also feel like it continues to be undervalued by society in general. I would hope moving forward that teachers are valued at the level of educated professionals that they actually are. Could you share what has been one of your most memorable moments in teaching? Honestly, there are too many to count, but that is probably because I have a different measure of what is memorable to me. Countless little moments of watching student after student achieve something that was thought impossible, or that they (or their families) were told they would never do. I have been lucky enough to witness these incredible moments time and again over the last 14 years, and each is just as special as the last. What is the most meaningful thing a student could say to you? “Look, I did it!” How would you ideally like to be characterized or remembered as a teacher? If I am fortunate enough to have made an impact enough to be remembered at all, that’s enough for me. I want to be remembered as a teacher who showed a student that school CAN be a place where they can succeed. Log In Keep it Clean.

Shelby County Criminal Court Judge Ronald Lucchesi disposed of multiple felony theft-related charges against Stevie Flockhart. The “celebrity pastor” was arrested last year on several charges that had those dropped in late December. According to the alleged victim, the 901 Church paid more than $6,000 in disputed credit card charges, but Flockhart did not admit fault. 901 Church had two locations with one in Bartlett at 6033 Old Brownsville Road and the other at 8077 Wilkinsville Road. Flockhart served as the lead pastor and in 2012, he appeared on American Idol and then was selected as a contestant on The Voice. Throughout 2023 Flockhart was trending on social media in the area for his alleged crimes. Lucchesi disposed of the previously filed felony charges of identity theft and theft of merchandise against Flockhart. Flockhart had been arrested on Nov. 2. Mark McCall, the former finance director of 901 Church from 2015 to 2022, accused Flockhart of opening a PayPal credit card account under McCall’s name, without his permission or knowledge. Allegedly, Flockhart racked up $6,410 in unapproved charges on that credit card account associated with the church. According to court records, the victim claimed that he found out in September that his credit score dropped and learned of a credit card with a $6,400 balance. The case against Flockhart was dismissed after “the prosecutor or plaintiff has decided to abandon the prosecution or lawsuit.” Court documents alleged that Flockhart and a victim agreed three years ago to open a joint credit card specifically for 901 Church, which has locations in Millington and Bartlett. © Copyright 2024 bartlett-express.com, Bartlett, TN'}]"

Now, with the Carousel s… To the Editor: To the Editor: Early voting for the March 5 Williamson County primary election got underway Feb. 14 at seven locations and will run through Tuesday, Feb. 27. And with its spread of two weeks and the activity on election day, it’s hard to pinpoint just how busy polling places will be in this late-winter primary. “This is one of the more unpredictable elections for us to try and gauge what the turnout might be,” said Chad Gray, administrator of elections for Williamson County. ... “It’s kind of an unusual year. We typically don’t have elections in March. But there are a number of races on the ballot.” This election will include the Republican presidential primary that at the moment will pit Nikki Haley against Donald Trump, with the former likely needing to win the Feb. 24 primary in her home state of South Carolina to have a chance in Williamson County. Early voters, and those voting on election day, will also be choosing the county’s next sheriff in a race featuring Darren Barnes Mark Elrod and Jeff Hughes. In addition, there is a two-person race between Erin Nations and David Veile for Circuit Court Judge Division III of the 21st Judicial District. Both primary winners for sheriff and judge will be unopposed in the August general election unless any independent candidates emerge. There is some competition in the Republican primary race for odd-numbered districts on the Williamson County Board of Education, while none of the Democratic candidates face opposition. Contested races pit Dennis S. Driggers vs. PJ Mezera in District 3, Angela Beaton vs. Michael Carter in District 7, and Darlynne S. Jordan vs. Claire Reeves in District 9. Unopposed are Tony Bostic in District 1, Margie Johnson in District 5 and Tonja Hibma in District 11. Democratic candidates are Elmer A. Mobley in District 1, Diane Cochran in District 3, Shandus Parish in District 9 and Laura Granere in District 11. Jen Aprea from District 5 is the only incumbent from the school board’s odd-numbered districts who chose to hold her seat, and she’ll run as an independent in the Aug. 1 general election. Voters will also see a list of Republican presidential primary candidates who had already dropped out of the race, names such as Chris Christie and Ron DeSantis. As Gray explained, Tennessee’s secretary of state announced in mid-December who the candidates for the presidential race are going to be, regardless of whether they’ve dropped out or suspended their campaign. In addition, the primary ballot includes a list of delegates-at-large and those from the 5th and 7th congressional districts. Voters are asked to vote for 14 at-large delegates and three from each of the districts, though they’re not required. Bottom line, according to Gray, voters may want to do their homework and check out a sample ballot before heading to the polls. One can be found on the Williamson Herald website at www.williamsonherald.com. “I really encourage voters to study the sample ballot so they’ll know how that works prior to arriving,” Gray said.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 3:25 am The Upper Cumberland Veterans Coalition had their fourth monthly meeting Feb.6. This is a newly formed organization that represents veterans in many ways, from honoring them to getting assistance with needs, to just being there for them in any way possible. “When we started this coalition, it was simply to be supportive of our veterans and their families,” said Lisa Gentry, Executive Director of Lafayette Housing Authority. “When you go into the military, you have someone screaming and yelling at you, telling you when and what to do. You get used to that after four or five years and then when you get out it’s just like, ‘OK, good luck, thank you for your service, get out’.” Gentry knows all of this because she, too, is a veteran. “When I got out, I didn’t have a clue as to what I was doing, and I struggled,” said Gentry. “The struggle was with various things. My daddy didn’t understand what I was going through. He didn’t understand why I stayed in my bedroom, only coming out to eat or go to work. When I went to work, it was really hard to relate to people (civilians who didn’t understand what I had been through).” Stacey Dyer, Lafayette Elementary Special Education teacher, and member of the U.C.V.C. knows how it is being a parent of a veteran as she has a son, Luke Dyer, that has come home after spending five years in the Navy. “As a parent, you’ve had them for 18 years, and then you send them off and they leave on that plane and there’s no communication other than letters,” she said. “You hope and pray for a phone call, but for that time period of boot camp you are a wreck. You think about all of these horrible things going on around the world. Always watching the news, and you hear all kinds of things. People talking to you about the ‘what if this happens’. It’s very difficult on parents and families of veterans as well.” Veterans often leave their homes young enough to where they have not fully matured, and come home oftentimes more mature than those twice their age. It is a strange time, and an even stranger existence coming home from the military to a world they don’t quite recognize, and relate very little with. “Coming home you’re just trying to find your niche in this world,” said Gentry. “It’s so extremely difficult. These people that you love and cherish, you don’t quite know them anymore, and they don’t know you anymore. You change and mature so much in the military.” Luke Dyer is home from five years in the United States Navy, and he feels much of what has been discussed during the meeting. “You all pretty well hit the nail on the head,” he said. “It is a different world in the military. It’s so rigid and strict for five years or however long you’re in. The minute they give you your walking papers, and you’re a civilian again — all that strict and rigid schedule that you’ve lived for all of those years is no longer part of you. You have to adapt and learn how to be what you were before you went in, even though you can never be that person again.” “It’s like going to jail, and becoming institutionalized,” said Paul Odie, Public Affairs Outreach with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. “You become part of the system. Then you come out and the system isn’t there anymore and you’re like ‘Wow, OK, thank you.’ But then there are programs and things to help veterans that you don’t learn about while in the military. I didn’t even think about benefits or know what they were. I went straight to work at the railroad once I got out of the military. I was young and healthy and just didn’t think about things like benefits.” There are several people available to reach out to, including the local Veteran Service Officer and the V.A. The Upper Cumberland Coalition for Veterans will be an extension of these resources, created to assist other agencies in supporting veterans locally and regionally. The mission statement of the U.C.V.C. is as follows: Support for our brothers and sisters who are serving or have served in the United States Military, as well as a foundation for their families. Resources in order to provide needed information to veterans in contact with agencies or individuals that can provide necessary assistance. Connections so that veterans and their families are able to network with others who are in the military community as well as outside the military.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Staff Reporter Mayor Freddie O\'Connell on Thursday officially kicked off the campaign to put a transit funding referendum on the November ballot. The Metro Council still must approve the proposal before it can go before Nashville voters. O\'Connell says his effort would focus on sidewalks, signals, service and safety. O\'Connell is establishing two committees — one focused on community priorities and one focused on the technical aspects of a transit plan — to meet in the coming weeks. A specific plan is expected to go before the Metro Council after March. ""We\'re a big city, and it\'s time to start acting like one,"" O\'Connell says. The effort will be the first big test for the O\'Connell administration, a longtime transit advocate who previously led the Nashville MTA board and was elected mayor last year. He declined to offer a cost for the plan, though he says it would be ""in the range of starting with a \'B\'"" over the course of multiple decades. O\'Connell says he is not focusing on light rail. He stopped short of promising dedicated bus lanes, though acknowledged dedicated lanes would likely be a significant part of the discussion. In 2018, Nashvillians overwhelmingly voted against an earlier transit referendum led by then-Mayor Megan Barry, who was forced to resign shortly before the vote. This year\'s effort is smaller in scale than that of six years ago, when dreams of light-rail lines running up the city\'s pikes and a tunnel underneath downtown led to questions about cost and need. The mayor’s office is also moving forward with a new North Nashville transit center and a new director of transit and mobility The mayor’s office is also moving forward with a new North Nashville transit center and a new director of transit and mobility ""[The 2018 referendum] had a crazy over-investment in light rail that I don\'t think was appropriate to the city with the limited density that Nashville has,"" O\'Connell told the Nashville Post during the 2023 mayoral campaign. ""We\'ll apply the lessons learned. We\'re going to focus on the things we know work, that are cost-effective, that are useful, that are visible, that are popular. And that\'s how we are going to get to a majority of support."" The smaller scale of the latest push was reflected in the venue of its announcement, a media room adjacent to the mayor\'s office, compared to the celebratory kickoff held at the Music City Center in 2017. O\'Connell\'s transition advisers recommended putting the transit referendum on the November ballot in order to take advantage of higher turnout for a presidential election. Tanisha Hall, a local transportation planner, was tapped by O\'Connell in part to lead a referendum effort, but she quickly left the mayor\'s office in order to preserve her consulting company\'s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise status. In partnership with Vanderbilt University, the mayor\'s office has brought on the school\'s director of transportation planning, Michael Briggs, in a temporary capacity expected to last a year or two. Briggs previously led the Metro Planning Department\'s multimodal transportation planning division.

Sometimes it can feel like your body is breaking down. One possible reason for this could be senescent cells, which build up in your body as you get older and contribute to age-related disorders. A recent study by Mayo Clinic shows that exercise and other physical activities can reduce the number of senescent cells. Dr. Nathan LeBrasseur, director of the Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging at Mayo Clinic, says people must prioritize physical activity, especially as they age. There is no magic pill to reverse the aging process. But if you want to counter the biological mechanisms that drive age-related conditions, like the accumulation of senescent cells, you will need to exercise. ""Just being more active throughout your day appears to be sufficient to reduce kind of the burden of senescence cells in an individual,"" says Dr. LeBrasseur. Many people tend to lead sedentary lifestyles when they age. But Dr. LeBrasseur says older adults should find ways to become more active throughout the day. ""Dedicating time, purposeful time, to getting some form of aerobic exercise or endurance exercise, like walking or cycling or swimming, and also getting some form of strength training is critically important,"" says Dr. LeBrasseur. He says just adding 30 minutes of activity daily can be beneficial. ""(It) may have benefits for muscle strength or bone health, or maybe even cognitive health and function,"" explains Dr. LeBrasseur.
