According to the CDC, Candida auris is a type of yeast that can cause severe illness in hospitalized patients. It primarily affects older people and those with weakened immune systems, rejects treatments from traditional antifungal medications and has a mortality rate of up to 60 percent, health officials said. There were at least 2,377 confirmed cases in the U.S. in 2022, according to CDC statistics. That total was a steep jump from the 1,474 cases in 2021 and continued a rapid increase from 2020, when there were just 757 confirmed cases. Health officials said that the fungus’s resistance to antifungal medication is “particularly concerning” because those medications are often the first option for treatment, saying it necessitates research into better protection and prevention measures against the fungus. “The rise in echinocandin-resistant cases and evidence of transmission is particularly concerning because echinocandins are first-line therapy for invasive Candida infections, including C auris,” a research paper into the spread of the fungus in the Annals of Internal Medicine said. “These findings highlight the need for improved detection and infection control practices to prevent spread of C auris.” The disease has now been tracked in half of the states in the U.S., and CDC officials said it was likely that the coronavirus pandemic worsened the spread of the fungus, as the increased attention on the COVID-19 virus meant there was less emphasis on screening for C. auris. Last month, health officials in Mississippi said the fungal infection may be responsible for four recent deaths in the state. At least 12 people have been infected since November, a spokesperson for the Mississippi State Department of Health confirmed to NBC News. In November, Nevada health officials linked 63 deaths in the state to C. auris. The virus was first reported in Japan in 2009, but researchers have tracked the earliest strain to South Korea in 1996. The fungus does not usually present a risk to young people. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

in people without diabetes, which could change the way doctors treat certain heart patients. Cardiovascular deaths\u200b due to extreme heat\u200b are projected to increase between 2036 and 2065, according to a study supported by the National Institutes of Health. People with moderate or extreme pain were more likely to die within the next 8 years compared with adults who did not have any post-heart attack pain, researchers found. John Sculli, a basketball referee, was officiating a semi-pro game when he collapsed. The arm pain that many men experience isn\'t as common in women, but neck or jaw pain, shortness of breath, nausea and fatigue are common. The dreaded weekend is here. The weekend when we lose an extra hour of sleep… Even though it\'s one little measly hour, there are some definite health risks that rise when we reset the hands on the clock. The director tweeted a selfie in a hospital gown late Sunday night, saying he had suffered a major health crisis. One week after suffering a massive ""widowmaker"" heart attack, a Silverthorne man is out of the hospital and thanking his hero. A suburban Denver police officer who had a heart attack during a struggle with a DUI suspect has been released from the hospital. Millions of Americans pop a daily baby aspirin to cut their risk of heart attack and stroke. But the guidelines for aspirin have been varied and vague over the years, leaving many people wondering if an aspirin is right for them. CBS4\'s Dr. Dave Hnida reports on new guidelines that are much more specific, and adds a new reason for taking this inexpensive protection. Researchers say a new study shows a clear link between some widely used heartburn medicines and heart attack risk. Millions of Americans take a daily aspirin to lower their risk of heart attack and stroke. Yet this little pill can carry some major side effects. CBS4 Medical Editor Dr. Dave Hnida reports on a new study that says many people who take aspirin should actually avoid it. Three men got the chance to thank the first responders who saved their lives. All three suffered cardiac arrest before they were helped by Littleton Fire rescuers. For decades, doctors have recommended that most people take a baby aspirin to lower their risk of heart attack. But now the FDA says aspirin should be a no-go for most. So what is the best thing to do? CBS4 Medical Editor Dr. Dave Hnida takes a look at the FDA recommendation -- and offers some advice about popping a daily pill. A 74-year-old man from Fort Collins has suffered an apparent heart attack and died while snowshoeing in Rocky Mountain National Park. A man from Aurora went for a run and most surely would have died along the way were it not for a quick-thinking stranger. The sudden death of James Gandolfini caught millions by surprise. But the word that he suffered a fatal heart attack isn\'t that unusual a story in today\'s world. CBS4 Medical Editor Dr. Dave Hnida explains that heart attacks are more common that you think -- and what you can do to prevent the ""big one."" If you\'ve got pain, odds are you may consider some ibuprofen or some other medication for relief. Now, a study links ibuprofen to a higher risk of heart attack and stroke. Do you need to worry that little tab will equal big problems? CBS4 Medical Editor Dr. Dave Hnida takes a look at the study. It\'s Heart Month, and no better time to remind men and women (especially women) that heart attacks don\'t always arrive with crushing chest pain. CBS4 Medical Editor Dr. Dave Hnida explains what other symptoms could signal trouble. A firefighter in Parker is back to work six months after he suffered a major heart attack on the job and nearly died. A new study says eating eggs is as bad for your heart as smoking. But is the study a good one, or does it lay an egg? Dr Dave Hnida tells you can relax if you\'re an egg eater-- you just need to get past the scary headline. Researchers in Denmark say traffic noise can give you a heart attack. Millions of Americans take sleeping pills to get a good night\'s snooze. But now a new study says these pills can be as bad for your health as cigarettes. Dr. Dave Hnida looks at whether sleeping pills truly up your risk of death. If you\'re waiting for crushing chest pain before you head to the ER to have your heart checked out, don\'t wait to long. Research shows the level of discomfort does not always match up with how badly your heart is suffering. Dr. Dave Hnida has advice. Can running down the street increase your risk of a heart attack? How about having sex? Dr Dave Hnida looks at a new study that looks at intense activity and your heart. Across the Denver metro area, residents and businesses were dealing with the aftermath of Thursday night\'s widespread and damaging hailstorm.

The WHO on Tuesday released new data showing the global tax rates on products like alcohol and sweetened beverages and claimed such rates are “low.” The UN health agency found 108 of its 194 member states are taxing some sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), though such excise taxes — which are applied for certain products — are only about 6.6 percent of the price of soda. At least 148 nations applied excise taxes to alcoholic beverages, but wine is exempt from such taxes in at least 22 countries, according to WHO. “Globally 2.6 million people die from drinking alcohol every year and over 8 million from an unhealthy diet, implementing tax on alcohol and SSBs will reduce these deaths,” the organization wrote in a statement. The average excise tax rate imposed on the most sold brand of beer is 17.2 percent of its cost and 26.5 percent for the most sold brand of spirits, WHO said. Pointing to a study in 2017, WHO argued taxes that increase the price of alcohol by 50 percent would help avoid over 21 million deaths over 50 years and generate an estimated $17 trillion in additional revenue. The WHO argued increased taxes will incentivize companies to make healthier products while helping curb injuries and conditions like cancers, diabetes and heart diseases. “Taxing unhealthy products creates healthier populations. It has a positive ripple effect across society — less disease and debilitation and revenue for governments to provide public services,” Dr. Rüdiger Krech, the director of Health Promotion with WHO, argued. People appear to be in support of raising taxes on such products, according to the organization.
