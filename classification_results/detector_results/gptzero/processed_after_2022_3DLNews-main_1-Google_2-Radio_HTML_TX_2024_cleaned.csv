son Hunter and a Ukrainian energy company has ""extensive"" contacts with Russian intelligence agencies, according to the Justice Department. Federal prosecutors also say in a new court filing that Alexander Smirnov admitted to authorities after he was arrested that ""officials associated with Russian intelligence were involved in passing a story"" about President Biden\'s son, Hunter Biden. Smirnov, a longtime FBI informant, was arrested last week and charged with making false statements and creating a false and fictitious record. He appeared in federal court in Nevada on Tuesday for his detention hearing. Magistrate Judge Daniel J. Albregts heard arguments from both sides, and then ordered that Smirnov be released on a personal recognizance bond. That ruling went against the government, which had asked the court to keep Smirnov in custody. In their detention memo, prosecutors pointed to what they called four ""indisputable facts"" that favored detention. Smirnov, they said, ""claims to have contacts with multiple foreign intelligence agencies"" and had planned to leave the U.S. for months just two days after he was arrested, to meet with Russian intelligence officials, among others. Prosecutors argued that his foreign intelligence contacts could resettle him if he were to flee the U.S. now. Prosecutors also said that Smirnov, 43, has access to $6 million in ""liquid funds,"" which he did not disclose to Pretrial Services. Instead, he told them that he had only $1,500 in cash on hand and $5,000 in a personal checking account, according to the government. Prosecutors also noted that Smirnov is a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen. While Smirnov has volunteered to turn over his Israeli passport, prosecutors say he could get a new passport at any time at an Israeli Consulate. But much of the government\'s detention memo focuses on Smirnov\'s alleged contacts with Russia\'s government and intelligence services. Prosecutors said Smirnov reported his contacts to his FBI handler. Smirnov described one of his contacts, named only as Russian Official 1, as someone ""who controls groups that are engaged in overseas assassination efforts."" Another contact is described as a high-ranking Russian foreign intelligence service officer. ""Smirnov\'s contacts with Russian officials who are affiliated with Russian intelligence services are not benign,"" prosecutors said. The government said that in September 2023, Smirnov ""pushed"" another story about President Biden and Hunter Biden that the FBI knew to be false. ""Thus, Smirnov\'s efforts to spread misinformation about a candidate of one of the two major parties in the United States continues,"" prosecutors said. ""He is actively peddling new lies that could impact U.S. elections after meeting with Russian intelligence officials in November."" In his detention memo, Smirnov\'s attorneys argued that the FBI had known of Smirnov\'s alleged conduct for years, ""yet took no steps to end his cooperation, seize his passports, or prosecute him for anything."" They also pushed back against the notion that he was a flight risk, noting what they called the government\'s ""prior, nonchalant assessment of that very same risk."" Copyright 2024 NPR.

state Attorney General Letitia James on Friday. A jury in Manhattan found top executives of the National Rifle Association liable after a six-week corruption lawsuit that she brought against the men. Two of the NRA\'s leaders, Wayne LaPierre and Wilson Phillips, have been ordered to repay roughly $6.4 million dollars between them. Their attorneys say they will appeal. ""This verdict is a major victory for the people of New York and our efforts to stop the corruption and greed at the NRA,"" James said in a statement. Just hours earlier a state judge in New York City finalized a ruling in another case brought by James, ordering former President Donald Trump to pay a total of $454 million in penalties linked to fraud allegations. He has 30 days to appeal. ""Donald Trump may have authored The Art of the Deal, but he perfected the art of the steal,"" James said at a news conference last Friday after the ruling against Trump was issued. She then took a shot at Trump\'s character: ""The scale and the scope of Donald Trump\'s fraud is staggering and so too is his ego and his belief that the rules do not apply to him."" James, 65, is a Democrat who made history as the first Black woman to serve as New York\'s attorney general. A Brooklyn native and a graduate of Howard University School of Law, she wasn\'t widely known outside New York City, where she served on the City Council and later in the largely ceremonial role of public advocate. But after just five years as New York state\'s attorney general, James has built a reputation as a giant-slayer, targeting — and in some cases, toppling — some of the most powerful figures and organizations in the United States. While her track record taking on and winning big cases has won James accolades, it has also drawn criticism. Trump and his allies have long claimed her choice of targets reflects bias on the part of an ambitious Democratic politician. ""We have a totally corrupt attorney general,"" Trump said during a news conference February 16th at his Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach, Fla., and he promised to appeal. ""She campaigned on the fact that \'I will get Trump, I will get Trump.\' Everybody\'s seen it,"" Trump added. Indeed, Trump\'s accusation that James is part of a political ""witch hunt"" is fueled in part by her own campaign rhetoric. When James ran for attorney general in 2018, Trump was still in the White House. She made it clear to voters that he was in her crosshairs. In one campaign video, James promised to ""take on President Donald Trump and anyone who tries to deny New Yorkers their most basic rights."" ""I\'m running for attorney general because I will never be afraid to challenge this illegitimate president,"" James said in another campaign video. After winning office, James gave an interview to NBC News in December 2018 where she promised to ""use every area of the law to investigate President Trump and his business transactions and that of his family as well."" She did as promised. During her first year in office, James successfully pursued her first civil lawsuit against Trump, filed initially by her predecessor, alleging he misused donations given to his charitable organization. Trump paid $2 million and his foundation was dissolved. ""These damages speak to the president\'s abuse of power,"" James said in a statement, adding that ""no one is above the law ... not even the president of the United States."" Despite agreeing to portions of the settlement, Trump fired back, denying wrongdoing and complaining he was being ""attacked by the political hacks in New York State."" In September 2022, James sued Trump again, this time on the fraud charges that led to last week\'s jaw-dropping penalties. During a news conference announcing the lawsuit,James acknowledged she would face criticism that her lawsuit is partisan. She said her investigation of Trump\'s business dealings ""only started after Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, testified before Congress about this conduct."" ""We have produced evidence about the scope, the scale, the depth, the breadth of the illegality, the fraud that personally enriched Donald Trump and his family,"" James said. Trump again blasted James, using a racially charged nickname and accusing her in a post on his Truth Social site of being a ""fraud who campaigned on a \'get Trump\' platform."" Conservative media have amplified claims by Trump, who faces dozens of criminal charges in four separate cases, that he is being attacked unfairly by Democratic prosecutors, including James, as part of an effort to cripple him politically. In Manhattan, Trump faces a criminal trial, brought by District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, linked to allegedly illegal hush money payments. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, also a Democrat, is pursuing criminal charges against Trump linked to allegations that he tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. Trump also faces federal charges linked to alleged election interference and charges that he improperly handled classified documents after leaving the White House. ""They\'re going in with a predetermined agenda and making that a campaign promise,"" said Fox News personality Sean Hannity in October on the TV channel. ""Does that sound like justice?"" Speaking on Hannity\'s program, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley echoed the concern that James, in particular, acted improperly. ""When James was running for office, I wrote that I thought there were serious ethical problems with a prosecutor really trying to secure office on the pledge to nail one person,"" Turley said.

""It has nothing to do with the responsibilities of the office. I\'ve never seen a more political attorney general."" James did briefly run for governor after Cuomo\'s resignation, but her campaign faltered. She withdrew from the governor\'s race and instead won a second term as state attorney general in November 2022. James didn\'t accept NPR\'s repeated requests for an interview for this story. In public appearances, however, she has addressed accusations that her lawsuits against Trump are political. ""This case has never been about politics or personal vendettas or about name-calling,"" James said last year. ""This case is about the facts and the law.""

Winds light and variable. Chance of rain 50%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 2:10 pm An hour and a half away from Beaumont, you\'ll find a fast-growing development called Colony Ridge. Critics say it\'s become a metropolis of migrants and a symbol of the border crisis. Others even claim it\'s a haven for the Mexican drug cartels. It\'s a community in Liberty County mired in controversy, and it\'s now the epicenter of immigration politics. Colony Ridge is a name that\'s become synonymous with illegal immigration, and it\'s become a lightning rod for conservative criticism. Many of the roughly 50,000 who live here are skilled day laborers. ""They could be working in Beaumont,"" said Liberty County Pct. 6 Constable Zack Harkness. Harkness acknowledges that are probably cartel-connected people who reside in Colony Ridge, but he tells KFDM that it\'s safe here, aside from a juvenile gang issue that\'s become on law enforcement\'s radar. Harkness always notes the visible presence of law enforcement at the development near Cleveland, Texas. Those who live here say there are a lot of misconceptions about Colony Ridge. While there are subpar homes with unkempt yards, the development includes new homes that look like they could be in any Houston suburb. Additionally, Colony Ridge has a community center located right next to a splash pad that gets very busy during the summertime. There are also modern schools. Cynthia Silva lives in Colony Ridge and moved here from Houston, saying it\'s safer than the big city. She writes for the area\'s online Spanish newspaper El Amanecer. ""There was a lot of backlash from people out in Plum Grove or Cleveland or Splendora to where it was a culture shock for them. They just weren\'t ready,"" Silva told KFDM. KFDM anchor Aaron Drawhorn waited several weeks for the CEO of Colony Ridge to agree to an on-camera interview. ""We have to address the illegal immigration controversy. I\'m sure you\'re asked about it all the time,"" Drawhorn told John Harris, CEO of Colony Ridge. ""Is it accurate to say that most residents in Colony Ridge are undocumented?"" KFDM asked Harris. ""No, no, that\'s just not true,"" he responded during the interview at his sales office in New Caney. ""If they borrow money from us, 77 percent have either a Social Security number or a tax ID number, and we don\'t ask [their immigration status]. That\'s the real reason we never know the actual number because we\'re not allowed to ask. It\'s illegal for us to ask,"" Harris explained. Colony Ridge started with 500 acres 13 years ago. Now it\'s the size of Washington, DC. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis posted on X, ""I will end this."" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton alerted the Texas delegation of the U.S. House of Representatives saying it\'s distressing neighboring cities and school districts. ""It\'s been getting increasingly worse. It\'s dangerous,"" said Rep. Randy Weber. ""You\'ve got, apparently businesses there, that are more than willing to take advantage of those who come here illegally, charge them high interest rates, and they\'re making a killing of it,"" Weber said. Colony Ridge became such a hot-button issue, it was put under the microscope in the Texas Legislature\'s third special session. The head of DPS, Colonel Steve McCraw testified that Colony Ridge is not a cartel hotbed. ""The bottom line is we got more of a growth problem, and a limited law enforcement resource problem, than a crime problem,"" McCraw said. On why Governor Abbott put the development on the agenda of the third special session, Harris told KFDM, ""The governor got backed into a corner. He responds to the people of Texas, and the news was crazy that the people of Texas were screaming at him."" Harris\' brother and business partner, Trey, has donated more than a million dollars to Governor Greg Abbott. ""I\'ve never met him,"" said John Harris. Soon the criticism against Colony Ridge wasn\'t just from the right. In December, the Biden Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Colony Ridge. “Colony Ridge promised the American dream, but we allege that in reality, it has delivered a nightmare for thousands of hardworking Hispanic families who hoped to build their homes in the Terrenos Houston community,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. Clarke said Colony Ridge operated ""an illegal land sales scheme and targeting tens of thousands of Hispanic borrowers with false statements and predatory loans."" Harris responded, ""It doesn\'t make sense that I started a 20-year relationship with my customers when they sign loan documents by tricking them. This is a partnership. It\'s not a fight.""

The image, which can be viewed below, has sparked new rumors that Hov will drop a new album this year. So far, Roc Nation seems to be denying the rumors of a Jay-Z album is in the works. On X, formerly known as Twitter, the management firm reposted a blogger\'s article about the rumors. They added the comment, ""That\'s news to us."" So, for now, a Jay-Z album this year remains uncertain. The first batch of rumors circulating about a possible new Jay-Z album can be traced back to November of 2023. Renowned auction house Christie\'s featured a unique Jay-Z-autographed collection of 14 exclusive metallic library cards. Notably, 13 of these cards showcased the album covers of Jigga\'s classic albums. But the 14th card had a slot that is blue featuring the words ""The Book of Hov,"" which cause people to speculate that Jay\'s new album could be in the works. However, according to the item description, the 14th card commemorated Jay-Z\'s Book of Hov tribute exhibition at the Brooklyn Public Library, which ended on Dec. 4, 2023. Should Jay-Z decide to release a new album this year, it would mark his first full-length music project in over seven years. His last album was the widely-praised 4:44, which dropped in June of 2017. Check out the photo that has fans thinking a new Jay-Z album is dropping soon below.'}]"

In 2005, he ventured into entrepreneurship, founding his record label, Show Dog, and later contributing to Show Dog-Universal Music. His journey wasn’t just about music; it was a tale of resilience, passion, and the pursuit of artistic authenticity. Fans, country music stars, everyone loved his authenticity.

I always thought of wild horses as a.) the subject of a Rolling Stones Song or as some semi-mythical beasts that live in Montana or South Dakota, like a Sasquatch. I found out this weekend that there are LOTS of wild horses in the mountains of southern New Mexico, only 100 miles from El Paso. I went up to Cloudcroft for a little R&R. I stayed in a little cabin just a couple blocks off of the main street of town. At about 11 pm, I hear the whinny of a horse nearby. Fine, I thought. Somebody next door has a horse, a big whup. Then I heard the whinny of the horse AGAIN but coming from the other direction. There sure are a lot of horses in this neighborhood. A minute later I hear the clip-clop of horse hoofs RIGHT OUTSIDE my FRONT DOOR! I had to investigate. Walking at a leisurely pace was a full-grown blackish-brown horse. Just walking down the street! I would have been willing to assume it was somebody’s horse that somehow got loose…except for what happened the very next night. I’m driving that two-lane backroad between Cloudcroft and Ruidoso. It’s a winding road and it was very dark, so it’s a good thing I was going under the speed limit. Otherwise, I might have plowed right into a herd (if that’s the correct word) of 6 or 7 horses. They were just walking down the highway like they owned it. I brought it up to a local later that night: “Do you all have wild horses up here around Cloudcroft?”, I asked. “We sure do, sug!” (That’s how waitresses in small towns talk.) “They’re all around these parts, but I haven’t seen them at all this winter”, the friendly Cloudcroftian said. I suppose I got lucky; first for having seen them at all and second, for not crashing my car into a family of them. I wish I had taken some pics or videos. Luckily, plenty of people already have. Check out these close encounters of the equine-kind in the nearby mountains of Southern New Mexico. ABC News even had a story about it a couple of years ago: That video is from closer to Ruidoso so I guess that means there’s a substantial population up there that has a fairly wide range. One of our MoSho callers told us that the horses are the descendants of the devastating Little Bear forest fire of 2012. According to the caller, people realized the fire was going to consume their property so the last thing some of them did was to turn their livestock out so they’d at least have a CHANCE of surviving. Plenty of them did. You might even catch a glimpse of them on your next trip to Cloudcroft, Ruidoso or Mayhill. Even if you don’t, who knows? Maybe you’ll see a family of Bigfoots like in this recently released nature footage:'}]"

But the two countries are in talks over how long those troops will stay. That\'s just one of the repercussions of the current conflict in the Middle East and a recent escalation in attacks between the U.S. and militias backed by Iran. NPR\'s Jane Arraf sent us this report from Baghdad. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in non-English language). JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: This was the scene in Baghdad from a funeral for a senior commander of the most powerful Iran-backed militia here, assassinated in the street in a U.S. drone strike. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in non-English language). ARRAF: Hundreds of fighters crowded the streets. A dozen of them carried the coffin of Abu Baqir Al-Saadi, a commander of Kataib Hezbollah, the Party of God Brigades, draped in a flag and covered with plastic flowers. This feels like it might be a turning point because this is not something that Kataib Hezbollah will forget. This funeral ceremony for a single man was more elaborate than that for 17 of their fighters killed on a base near Syria recently. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Non-English language spoken). ARRAF: A militia speaker, Sheikh Abu Talib Al-Saidi, praised the commander as a resistance fighter, saying he was involved in 25% of more than 200 attacks on U.S. and Israeli targets. ABU TALIB AL-SAIDI: (Through interpreter) Today, thanks to God Almighty and with the blessings of the Islamic resistance in Iraq and everyone for this brave, heroic and holy stance with the people of Gaza. ARRAF: Two weeks ago, a militia attack on a U.S. base in Jordan killed three U.S. service people. The U.S. says it bore the fingerprints of Kataib Hezbollah. It killed Al-Saadi in a drone strike in retaliation. QASIM AL-ARAJI: (Non-English language spoken). ARRAF: Iraq\'s national security adviser, Qasim al-Araji, is one of the mourners. He tells us that strike made clear the need to disband the U.S.-led military coalition. AL-ARAJI: (Through interpreter) This incident will reinforce the necessity of ending the international coalition\'s mission. I believe that one year is sufficient for the coalition forces to leave Iraq. ARRAF: While Al-Saadi was attacking the U.S., a close ally of Iraq, here\'s the complication - as al-Araji notes, the militia he belonged to, one that fought the militant Sunni group ISIS, is now part of Iraq\'s official security forces. AL-ARAJI: (Through interpreter) The man is a fighter and a leader of the Popular Mobilization Forces. The Popular Mobilization Forces are a national institution, and they are part of the security system. So this is a targeting of the sovereignty of the Iraqi state. ARRAF: The Kataib Hezbollah spokesman, Mohammed Mohi, says the U.S. will pay a heavy price. MOHAMMED MOHI: (Through interpreter) He is one of our major leaders that the United States dared to target. God willing, we will confront the United States and not only expel it from Iraq but the entire region, as well. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Chanting in non-English language). UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in non-English language). ARRAF: Before the assassination, Kataib Hezbollah said it would suspend attacks on the U.S. in deference to the Iraqi government. That all changed after the drone strike. Kataib Hezbollah is part of a coalition of mostly Iran-backed Shia militias targeting the U.S. and Israel. They\'re loosely connected to groups in other countries, like Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HASSAN NASRALLAH: (Non-English language spoken). ARRAF: ...Whose leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is fighting Israel across the Lebanese border. In Baghdad, we sat down with the spokesman for one of the other militias in the coalition, Kata\'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada. For Sheikh Kadhim al-Fartousi, this is a holy fight. Al-Fartousi says under Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, Iraqis were dragged into devastating wars with Iran and over Kuwait. KADHIM AL-FARTOUSI: (Through interpreter) Those wars were imposed on Iraq, but today the Iraqis are choosing this war. This war confirms that they belong to their homeland and to Iraqi sovereignty, and also confirms their belonging to the Arab and Islamic people in support of Palestine and Gaza. ARRAF: But in the streets and the glitzy cafes springing up in Baghdad, Iraqis are not choosing war. Most people not involved in militias are just trying to live their lives, find jobs, study, raise children in what they hope will eventually be a peaceful and prosperous country. It\'s a far cry from the chants of - death to America and death to Israel - at the militia events. It was mostly young fighters killed in the U.S. strike on an Iraqi militia base near the Syrian border, the first of the U.S. retaliatory strikes after the attack on its base in Jordan. Iraqi officials say militia leaders have left for Iran. Iraq\'s foreign minister, Fuad Hussein, tells us it\'s a difficult atmosphere to hold discussions on U.S. forces. FUAD HUSSEIN: I mean, if there will be attacks and counterattacks, then it will be difficult to negotiate. We cannot negotiate through bullets. ARRAF: The U.S. believes there should be a smaller U.S. military presence here but still a presence. Hussein says there\'s a more basic question. F HUSSEIN: Which kind of relationship do we want with the American? For Iraqis, we are really caught between an ally, which is the American, and a neighbor, which is the Iranian, and they are fighting each other on our soil. So this is very strange. ARRAF: Hussein canceled meetings with Iranian officials after Iran attacked a private home in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, claiming without proof it was an Israeli intelligence base. He says it\'s because Iran is afraid to attack Israel directly. F HUSSEIN: They must stop these kinds of attacks because they know that what they are talking about is baseless. But they are attacking us. If it is an attack against Israel, Israel is somewhere else. It\'s not in Iraq. ARRAF: The foreign minister, who is Kurdish, says since most Kurdish and Sunni parties want U.S. troops to stay in Iraq, any decision has to be a joint one. Twenty-one years ago, the U.S. invaded this country. It toppled Saddam Hussein but created a security vacuum. Following a civil war and then the war against the Sunni militant group ISIS, Iraq, while still volatile, has become a lot calmer in the last five years. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL GROUP: (Singing in non-English language). ARRAF: During a religious commemoration in Baghdad last week, millions of pilgrims walked to the shrine of a Shia imam - ceremonies banned under Saddam and later bombed by militant Sunni groups during the sectarian war. These pilgrims are walking in safety. (SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER WHIRRING) ARRAF: In the air, an Iraqi military helicopter hung with a huge religious banner keeps watch. The Shia, a majority in Iraq, are grateful for the religious freedom, but most don\'t want the complications of having U.S. forces here. QAID HASSAN HUSSEIN: (Non-English language spoken). ARRAF: An off-duty policeman, Qaid Hassan Hussein, is near a gas burner, stirring a huge pot of rice to help feed the pilgrims. Q HUSSEIN: (Non-English language spoken). ARRAF: ""A question,"" he says. Q HUSSEIN: (Non-English language spoken). ARRAF: He\'s saying that if you\'re in your house and a stranger comes, and he wants to enter and tell you who comes in and out, would you accept that? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL ARTIST: (Singing in non-English language). ARRAF: Two decades on, for many Iraqis, the U.S. is not just a stranger at the door but a threatening one.

'HUMAN_ONLY', 'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'MESQUITE, Texas (AP) — At a bustling construction site outside of Dallas, there are hopes that Congress can finally pass nearly $95 billion in foreign aid including funding for Ukraine — because factory jobs in the United States depend on that money. Aerospace and defense company General Dynamics’ new factory in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite is expected to initially employ 150 people to produce munitions. Set to open in June, construction is nearing completion, with newly planted trees and shrubs already in place at the complex overlooking one of the area’s busiest interstates. “We want to increase our wages and increase our skill levels and job opportunities,” said Kim Buttram, Mesquite’s director of economic development, who added that the factory is expected to have over 300 jobs when it’s at full production. As President Joe Biden pushes House Republicans to pass needed aid, he wants voters to understand that nearly two-thirds — or nearly $40 billion — of the money for Ukraine would actually go to U.S. factories spread out across the country including plants in Lima, Ohio and Scranton, Pennsylvania as well as Mesquite. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has refused to put the bill up for a vote on the House floor on the premise that it does not meet the needs of the American public. The supplemental spending measure contains a total of $95 billion in foreign aid, including money for Ukraine, Israel and other countries. Of the $60.7 billion for Ukraine, $38.8 billion would go to U.S. factories that make missiles, munitions and other gear, according to figures provided to The Associated Press by the Biden administration. “While this bill sends military equipment to Ukraine,” Biden said Tuesday, “it spends the money right here in the United States of America in places like Arizona, where the Patriot missiles are built; and Alabama, where the Javelin missiles are built; and Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas, where artillery shells are made.” The president’s argument challenges criticism by some Republican lawmakers that the federal government should be spending more money at home instead of supporting overseas wars. In this case, most of the money goes to U.S. companies and workers, funding assembly lines to refill depleted stockpiles of weapons and gear that have already gone to Ukraine. The Democratic president is openly channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt and resurrecting the World War II-era concept that America is the “arsenal of democracy.” His sales pitch to the public is that his foreign policy is also about jobs for the U.S. middle class. But Biden is brushing up against opposition from former President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner who ascended to the White House in 2016 on the promise of reviving U.S. manufacturing. Trump opposes the U.S. package to help Ukraine and has openly expressed a willingness to let Russia invade NATO allies who do not spend enough of their own budgets on defense. Many Republicans in Congress have taken their lead from Trump, with the party’s right flank increasingly questioning the value of U.S. interventions around the world and long-standing alliances built in the aftermath of World War II. Johnson has refused to bring the foreign aid bill up for a vote because it also lacks provisions to secure the U.S. southern border where immigrants are crossing illegally. But he previously rejected a bipartisan Senate bill that did provide funding to address immigration challenges, saying that the border measures would not solve the problem in the way that he wanted. “The Republican-led House will not be jammed or forced into passing a foreign aid bill that was opposed by most Republican senators,” Johnson said at a news conference last week. “It’s time for Washington to start showing some love to Americans.” Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, in contrast, has repeatedly implored his colleagues to understand that the funds from the package are for historic investments “right here in America.” “This is about rebuilding the arsenal of democracy,” McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a floor speech during the long days of debate, “and demonstrating to our allies and adversaries alike that we’re serious about exercising American strength.” The Mesquite factory sits in the congressional district of Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, who told Fox Business News in a December interview that he couldn’t tell his constituents that he voted for money for Ukraine without also getting money to secure the U.S. southern border. “I will never support any funding for Ukraine that does not include major measures of security at our own southern border,” said Gooden. His office did not respond to questions sent over email from The Associated Press for this story. U.S. factories shipped out nearly $162 billion worth of military goods last year, according to the Census Bureau. The shipments increased 8.1% compared to 2022. The supplemental funding could further drive factory production upward this year. But defense manufacturing can be volatile. Spending declined between 2010 and 2015. It then grew over the next four years, only to dip in 2021 and then climb again after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The Biden administration has made an increase in the manufacturing capacity of defense contractors a priority, with a plan to increase the production of 155-millimeter artillery shells six-fold over three years. The supplemental bill stalled in the House would expand these efforts by making new investments in production lines for weapons and revitalizing the industrial base for submarine production, according to the White House. But on Friday, after news of the death of imprisoned Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, Biden again pushed House Republicans to pass aid to Ukraine and take a stand against Russian leader Vladimir Putin. But the House had gone into recess on Thursday afternoon. “It’s about time they step up — don’t you think? — instead of going on a two-week vacation,” Biden said. “What are they thinking? My God, this is bizarre.” ___ AP chief congressional correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report. Boak reported from Washington. KTSA is a part of Alpha Media LLC.© 2024 Alpha Media LLC.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'An email went out this morning to some student loan borrowers basically saying, you\'re debt free. On Wednesday, the federal Education Department zeroed out loan balances for nearly 153,000 borrowers. They are people who borrowed $12,000 or less, have been paying their student loans for at least 10 years, and enrolled in the Biden administration\'s new repayment plan called SAVE launched last summer. ""We\'re providing debt relief to people who need it the most,"" said Education Secretary Miguel Cardona on Wednesday in an interview on NPR\'s Morning Edition. ""We\'re also addressing the root cause of the issue, which is, the cost of college is out of control,"" Cardona said. The Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan has become a key vehicle for President Biden and Secretary Cardona since the Supreme Court last year struck down the administration\'s plan to forgive hundreds of billions of dollars in federal student loan debt. Republican lawmakers have tried to stop the SAVE plan, arguing that it is outside of the administration\'s authority and criticizing the president for campaigning for votes with the new policy. Wednesday\'s debt cancellation announcement comes after a shaky rollout of the new FAFSA application resulting in a delay of student aid award letters, along with people unable to fill out the form. NPR\'s Steve Inskeep interviewed Education Secretary Miguel Cardona about the SAVE plan and problems with the financial aid application and awards process. The conversation below has been edited for length and clarity. By paying off people\'s excessive debts, you encourage colleges to keep charging more and more. Is there a moral hazard involved in forgiving debts which allows colleges to encourage people to borrow more in the future? It\'s a moral hazard if you\'re only doing debt relief, but I believe we\'re balancing it out with accountability on colleges and making sure that the return on investment is clear. And, where we\'re putting pressure on those colleges that are charging $150,000 to $200,000 for a degree that students could get for $50,000 somewhere else. Would you explain how your authority is different when relying on this 1965 law [Higher Education Act] than it had been under the law the Supreme Court rejected for you? The Supreme Court rejected the president\'s most bold plan to provide debt relief in our country\'s history using the Heroes Act. It was pandemic related. The Supreme Court struck that down. However, the mentality of making higher education more affordable has never diminished in this administration. We use the Higher Education Act [of 1965], the authority that it gives me as Secretary of Education to, for example, make payment plans based on income. We\'re using the negotiated rulemaking process to come up with a debt relief plan that will positively impact Americans and give them an opportunity to to get back on their feet. We\'re unapologetic about this. Can this debt relief, in your view, survive any court challenge? And, can this debt relief survive a change in presidential administrations? We\'re using the regulatory process, which we believe includes public comment and negotiations with folks that don\'t agree with us. So we do believe through this process it can continue, but we recognize that no matter what turn we make, we\'re going to have folks challenging it. There are some that benefit from the system the way it was and I expect to hear from them. And, if I don\'t hear from them, that means I\'m not pushing hard enough. Mr. Secretary, in moving up this announcement of the student loan debt forgiveness, some people will naturally wonder if your attention is on the right problem right now because you\'re in the middle of serious delays with FAFSA, the standard college financial aid form. Many people are going to get close to their college acceptance dates before they hear back from the federal government about financial aid. Are you on top of that problem? We absolutely are. Since day one, we\'ve been fighting, whether it\'s fixing public service, loan forgiveness, doing the income driven repayment adjustments. And with regard to FAFSA – yes, we\'re working aggressively there. We recognize that there are delays and we\'re working daily around the clock to make sure that we get the information as quickly as possible. We\'re moving in the right direction. Change is hard. We\'re focused on it. As a parent of a high school senior myself, I recognize that delays are challenging. But at the end of the day, what we\'re delivering is going to be better for the American people. I grant that the overall effort is to improve the process. But the immediate problem, as you know, is there\'s been this problem with calculations for adjustments for inflation. People are experiencing delays they would want to have heard in January, but may hear in March. And many people have college acceptance dates of May. Can you guarantee the public that they\'re going to get their information in time to think about their college decisions and answer on time? Yes. We support those colleges that are stepping up and saying, you know, I\'m going to push back the date. It is a major change. We recognize there are delays and those are frustrating. But at the end of the day, more students will get more aid, more access to college; and at the end of the day, that\'s the goal. This story was edited by Erika Aguilar.

The body of the 11-year-old girl was found by law enforcement Tuesday in the Trinity River under the Highway 59 overpass. District Attorney Shelly Sitton revealed that they would be processing paperwork to charge Don Steven McDougal with Capital Murder. McDougal had been placed under arrest on Friday on an unrelated aggravated assault charge. According to reports, McDougal was the last person with Cunningham before her disappearance. McDougal has been living in a trailer on the same property where Audrii and her father live near Lake Livingston. At an earlier press conference, Sheriff Lyons indicated that McDougal had been responsible on several occasions for taking Cunningham to the bus stop or her school. She was reported missing on Thursday when she did not get on her bus or make it to school. An Amber Alert was issued late Thursday night, which has now been discontinued. Audrii's body is being sent to the Harris County Medical Examiner to determine the cause of death. According to a Fox 26 report, McDougal has a long history of crime and violence. Since her disappearance, authorities had been concentrating their search along the southern and eastern shores of Lake Livingston, as well as along the Trinity River downstream from the Lake Livingston Dam. A backpack consistent in description with one that Cunningham owned was found near the dam. Numerous law enforcement agencies assisted in search efforts for the past 5 days including Polk County agencies, Texas Rangers, DPS, and the FBI. Many volunteer search organizations also helped. Sheriff Lyons extended his sincere thanks to all who sacrificed so much time and effort. He also thanked all those who provided tips to the case. Please keep Audrii, and her family and friends, along with all persons involved with the case in your prayers. The video of today's press conference can be found below.
