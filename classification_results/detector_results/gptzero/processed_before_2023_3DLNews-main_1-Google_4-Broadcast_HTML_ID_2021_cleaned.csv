My reporting also got signs added to a neighborhood after speeding cars hit a woman's home twice. My first job took me to Tupelo, Mississippi, as a multimedia journalist and anchor. One of my memorable moments there was covering the death of Aretha Franklin. I graduated from the University of South Carolina. My passion for journalism started in high school while hosting a local radio show. When I am not working, you will catch me binge-watching shows, trying new restaurants, traveling and shopping.
