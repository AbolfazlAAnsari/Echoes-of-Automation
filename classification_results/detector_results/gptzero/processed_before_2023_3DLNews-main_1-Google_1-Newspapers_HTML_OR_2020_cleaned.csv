(Family photo via AP, File)A Louisiana state trooper has died following a single-vehicle highway crash that happened just hours after he learned he would be fired for his role last year in the in-custody death of a Black man. Master Trooper Chris Hollingsworth was pronounced dead Tuesday following a brief hospitalization, Warren Lee, chief investigator for the Ouachita Parish Coroner's Office, told The Associated Press. Hollingsworth had been airlifted to Shreveport early Monday after crashing his personal vehicle on Interstate 20 near Monroe. Police have not released any details about how the crash occurred. Hours before, Hollingsworth had received word that State Police intended to terminate him following an internal investigation into the May 2019 death of Ronald Greene, a case that has drawn mounting scrutiny and become the subject of a federal civil rights investigation. Authorities initially said Greene died after crashing his vehicle into a tree following a high-speed chase in rural northern Louisiana that began over an unspecified traffic violation. But Greene’s family alleges troopers used excessive force and “brutalized” him while taking him into custody. State Police, despite growing pressure, have repeatedly declined to release body-camera footage and other records related to Greene’s arrest, citing the ongoing investigations.

(AP photo) The controversy deepened last week when Greene’s family released graphic photographs showing deep bruises and cuts to his face, and other photos showing his car with little damage. That raised questions about whether Greene received those injuries in a car crash — as authorities initially told his family — or when troopers arrested him. State Police have said only that the 49-year-old Greene died “after resisting arrest and a struggle with troopers” who took him into custody. The agency opened an internal investigation into the case last month. It was not immediately clear what impact Hollingsworth’s death would have on ongoing investigations. Hollingsworth was the only one of the six troopers involved who had been placed on leave. That came Sept. 9 — the same day the AP filed a records request for body camera footage of Greene’s arrest.

government and public safety in Umatilla County PENDLETON — Pendleton Police Chief Stuart Roberts praised the proactive safety planning of organizers with the Black Lives Matter protest on Saturday, Aug. 29, as a key in keeping the event peaceful. And aside from a few minor incidents between some protesters and counterprotesters, the planning paid off. “I think what really gave us an opportunity to prepare to the best of our ability was the willingness on the part of the BLM organizers to communicate,” Roberts said on Aug. 31. Roberts said he held five meetings with the protest’s organizers — Briana Spencer, Nolan Bylenga and John Landreth — in the days leading up to the event, and said they were “communicative,” “engaged,” and “flexible” in their planning. Roberts said he also made contact with those associated with the counterprotest, which he noted as being more loosely organized. In addition to 11 Pendleton police officers stationed at the event, Roberts said there were also two deputies from the Umatilla County Sheriff’s Office, two officers from the Umatilla Tribal Police Department and 10 troopers from Oregon State Police providing assistance on Aug. 29. While police had a number of operational and contingency plans in place ahead of time, according to Roberts, there was still the need to be fluid and reactive to unexpected events. “Probably the most significant thing that occurred that wasn’t anticipated was when some of the Three Percenters decided to rush the back of the march and created a lot of conflict,” he said. As the protest’s planned speeches ended at Roy Raley Park on Southwest Court Avenue, those with the Black Lives Matter group took to the streets of Pendleton, while law enforcement officers helped block and secure the route from other traffic as planned. However, some counterprotesters carrying flags and firearms, who were standing on the south side of Court Avenue quickly crossed the street and attempted to follow the march. That resulted in verbal jawing and minor pushing and shoving between some protesters and counterprotesters while Pendleton police, including Roberts himself, tried to keep the groups separated. At one point, Roberts said a firearm from one of the counterprotesters fell to the ground, exemplifying the heightened safety risks brought on by those who introduced firearms to the event. “I get the whole Second Amendment piece of this, but why carry the firearm?” Roberts said. Though the counterprotest claimed to be there to voice support for police, Roberts said the actions and intentions of some in attendance were merely antagonistic. “When I challenged them verbally they wanted to debate with me their rights and said they were here to support the police,” Roberts said of the counterprotesters who tried to trail the march. “My position is you’re not supporting me by creating more work for me or making my job more difficult.” As the march returned to Roy Raley Park and participants on both sides began dispersing shortly after 6 p.m., a small group of Black Lives Matter protesters remained on the north side of Court and traded obscenities, insults and offensive gestures with a group of counterprotesters who remained on the south side until groups left sometime after 10 p.m. “The fact that we have to stand there for multiple hours and endure that — I’m less than impressed,” Roberts said. “It’s not representative of this community and, quite frankly, it’s offensive to a lot of people.” Along with trying to keep each group to their respective side of the street, Roberts said nearly every officer at the protest was on overtime pay. “Make no mistake, it was an expensive day for the city and state,” Roberts said. Roberts also provided a written statement to organizers that was read at the start of the event and supported protesters voicing their pain over the killings of George Floyd and other people of color, which he condemned as “inexcusable,” while urging protesters to hold officials accountable and seek change peacefully. “Rest assured, I applaud your unwillingness to accept the status quo, but I also challenge you to do everything within your power to affect the change you seek through peaceful dialogue and debate, not just presenting problems with no thoughtful solutions,” Bylenga read from Roberts’ statement. Roberts stressed his statements weren’t political or personal but were completely his own words and thoughts on the current protest movement. “I can’t think of a more contemporary issue that requires leaders to lead than this activity that’s going on currently across this nation involving civil unrest,” Roberts said. After the event, Bylenga, a local organizer and Democratic candidate for House District 58, praised the efforts of police to maintain safety between the groups. “Chief Roberts has done everything in his power to let everyone here exercise their rights,” Bylenga said. A Facebook message from one person associated with organizing the counterprotest indicated they couldn’t be reached for comment by deadline on Aug. 29. A message from the East Oregonian to the person listed as the host of the protest’s Facebook event went unanswered.

Has it always been like this? Around 50 years ago there wasn’t such a thing as designated smoke areas. When you walked into a classroom there would be big glasses, wild hair, and puffs of smoke coming from students and teachers during lectures. In 1981, Oregon legislation passed the Indoor Clean Air Act which prohibited smoking inside public buildings. This was to protect non-smokers from second-hand smoke. In 2009, the Indoor Clean Air Act had some modifications that included banning smoking within 10 feet of public doorways. After this ban, colleges everywhere had to make arrangements for the students who partake in smoking. “They [Linn County Department of Health] came out here and they told us, ‘If we find cigarette butts anywhere close to your doors, you’re going to get cited,’” said Marcene Olson, Director of Public Safety at LBCC. “That’s when we pushed shelters farther out away from the buildings and got a lot more strict about making sure people were there.” Oregon State University has gone a little further than LBCC with smoking policies; they’ve implemented a full campus ban. The average cigarette smoker starts before the age of 26, making smoke-free and tobacco-free policies at universities and colleges important, according to CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). A full campus may be ideal for the health of students on campus, but it’s easier said than done. “We [LBCC] haven’t gone that far because we don’t think we could really control it, and I know they can’t control it. They get complaints all the time.” says Olson. “Designated smoking areas are great, we don’t need to be able to smoke anywhere,” says Arron Morris, a student at LBCC, when asked what his reaction would be if a full campus ban was implemented, “I have a friend who has dangerously low blood pressure and his doctor informed him to keep smoking, it’s like the safest option for him. It can be a little off putting or almost discriminatory to have a full campus ban.” There was a time where smoking tobacco was not seen as a potential health risk, and doctors would even go as far as recommending it to patients. From the 1930s to the 1950s, advertisers used the phrase “doctors recommended” to sell more cigarettes. Back then it was only seen as a product to give you a smoker’s cough, but lung-cancer or heart-disease were never considered. I’m sure you’ve noticed that things have altered quite a bit since then. During the 1950s was when this change slowly started taking off. The study that jump-started this switch was conducted by E. Cuyler Hammond and Daniel Horn; scientists working for the American Cancer Society. In January of 1952, they began their study, gathering information that could connect smoking habits with lung cancer and higher death rates. To do this they collected 22,000 volunteers across 10 states to follow men on their past and current smoking habits. Each volunteer was assigned to 5 to 10 men from ages 50 to 60, which added up to a total of 188,000 men being monitored. Every few months the volunteers followed up with their assigned men to note whether they were dead, alive, or unavailable. Hammond and Horn then collected the death certificates on the deceases. After only 20 months of this study, they came to what was a clear conclusion. “It was found that men with a history of regular cigarette smoking have a considerably higher death rate than men who have never smoked or men who have smoked only cigars or pipes,” wrote Hammond and Horn in their publication of their research on August 7, 1954 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The American Cancer Society worked off of this study for years to come, which led to the information we have today. This new knowledge made the U.S. Congress raise their heads. They implemented the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965, which required cigarette companies to print warnings on their products packaging. Phrases in 1965 read as, “CAUTION: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH,” and they then shifted the wording due to the Public Health Smoking Act of 1969 to, “WARNING: THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS DETERMINED THAT CIGARETTE SMOKING IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH.” Today the policies in place require warnings to take up at least 20% of the visible packaging and 30% of the sides of the product depending on their size and shape. These regulations are also enforced on all non-smoke tobacco products; not just cigarettes. With all of these health-threatening factors to tobacco, it’s understandable why campuses have gone through the changes we have seen over the last 50 years or so. “It has progressed, a lot more people are sensitive to smokers, cause there’s just less smokers now.” says Olson. Many people have struggles with where to begin when it comes to quitting smoking. Below are a few resources to look into if you’re interested.

A Tillamook lumber mill worker was tested for coronavirus this past week, leading operations to shut down Thursday, March 12, for a cleaning. Hampton Lumber Mill Plant Manager Mark Elston issued a statement about the employee and the closure. In the statement, Elston said the employee was tested at the local hospital and advised by medical professionals to self-quarantine at home pending results. “The employee is following that advice and has committed to inform us of a positive or negative result once known,” Elston said. “We will let our employees know this result and will keep the appropriate community leaders informed.” Elston said upon learning of the possible infection risk, Hampton Lumber closed shop to clean and sanitize areas the employee frequented. He said the relevant break rooms, restrooms, offices, and control rooms were sanitized by a local cleaning service. “We take the health and safety of our employees and the community very seriously,” Elston said. “We will monitor the situation and take the appropriate action to safeguard our employees and our operation as we get additional information.” As of Monday, March 16, Elston said the employee’s test results had not yet been received. The mill was reopened for work after the temporary shutdown to sanitize gathering areas.

To this day, tomatoes, while considered a botanical fruit, are not usually referred to as a fruit in “common speech” but instead are deemed a vegetable. To the surprise of many judicial enthusiasts, the legal question of where the tomato qualifies under government regulations required a decision from a higher authority – a process that went all the way up to the Supreme Court of the United States, no less. The final word on how the U.S. would regulate tomatoes come from the Supreme Court case Nix V. Hedden. In 1883, a new Tariff Act was signed by the 21st U.S. president, Chester A. Arthur. The new policy was unpopular, with some items having their tax rates lowered, others having their rates raised, and still others left with no clear vision. This included an important contradiction: There were tariffs on vegetables, but not on fruits. In New York, the John Nix & Co. business was a leading seller of produce and a large importer of goods from Virginia, Florida, and Bermuda. With taxes on vegetables being 10%, Nix & Co. was determined to switch the label of tomatoes from vegetable, to fruits. And so the firm launched a lawsuit against Edward L. Hedden, who was the Collector of Customs at the Port of New York (the federal officer in charge of collecting import duties by sea). Thus did a Supreme Court case begin in 1892, as Nix V. Hedden would decide how the tomato should be labeled, by law. What followed was a dictionary battle, with both sides using examples of other fruits and vegetables to support their argument. The defendants (Hedden) claimed that tomatoes should remain classified as vegetables as other “vegetables,” such as cucumbers, peas, and squash, are also botanically fruit but remained labeled as a vegetable by law. The plaintiffs countered with turnips, potatoes, carrots, etc., all of which are correctly referred to as botanical vegetables. As of today, two of the U.S. states, Tennessee and Ohio, have named the tomato as their state fruit. By contrast, the only state to declare the tomato as its state vegetable is New Jersey. Regardless, on May 10, 1893, the verdict of the Court was unanimous. Associate Justice Horace Gray wrote for the court’s opinion: “Botanically speaking, tomatoes are the fruit of a vine, just as are cucumbers, squashes, beans, and peas… But in the common language of the people, whether sellers or consumers of provisions, all these are vegetables.” And so tomatoes, under the U.S. Supreme Court case, Nix V.

Dolson has been racing a vintage Corvette with considerable success over the past 25 years. Over the Labor Day Weekend, Dolson was the recipient of the Zupans Markets Historic Races Pete Lovely Award, voted upon by the crews who work the races. “This means much to me,” Dolson wrote in a reflection on the honor. “You who work the flag stations, the starting grid, the tow trucks ... you not only make racing possible, you see it all, for long hours in bitter cold or blistering heat, risking your own well-being to keep drivers safe, sometimes saving lives. Your recognition is something I value more than any checkered flag.” Last year, Dolson was awarded the Wemme Trophy, a lifetime-achievement award recognizing significant contributions to Portland vintage racing. Dolson took up racing at age 45 — and sailing at age 65. Is the drive toward pursuing new adventures later in life a choice or something innate? Hard to say. “There are a lot of options,” Dolson told The Nugget. “One is to not do anything — by choice, I suppose. Take it easy. There are those, unfortunately, who can’t do what they used to do or want to do. I am incredibly fortunate that I am able to pursue passions that I’ve had for decades — and pick up some new ones.” The passions may be innate, but the effort to pursue them takes deliberate effort. “The conscious choice is when I go run the river trail two or three times a week, or I go to the gym three times a week to maximize my physical capabilities — or as I prefer to say — make the world a lighter place.” In addition to maintaining physical health, there are advantages to age that enhance mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. “I am more grateful now — for so many things — than at almost any other time of my life,” Dolson said. “I think this comes with perspective, which comes with age. Gratitude displaces a lot of negativity, which can be so corrosive.” A recently-acquired joy is riding an electric unicycle. The unit, which is steered off the rider’s balance, can achieve speeds of 35 miles per hour — which is quite a lot when there’s nothing separating the rider from the pavement. Dolson uses it to run into town from where his sailboat docks — and to simply enjoy himself. Whenever the unicycle comes out, there are stares — and even friends can be a little aghast at what he gets up to. “I occasionally get the rueful shake of the head,” he acknowledged. “They’ve probably been shaking their head at me for the last 40 years. Acting my age has never been my strong suit.” The septuagenarian can’t quibble with their judgment. “I don’t disagree with them,” he said with a wry laugh. He noted that when he crashed on his unicycle a few months ago and injured his shoulder, “I wondered if I’d taken it a step too far. But the shoulder healed.” And Dolson climbed back up on the wheel. He’s not planning on stopping. One of the advantages to taking up avocations that some might find outlandish when you’re past middle age is that you’re well past worrying about what others think about it. “I’m there to feel the joy of balanced movement,” he said. “And it doesn’t matter if someone thinks I’m indulging in risky behavior.” It’s not risk per se that drives Dolson. He noted that he gave up flying because he considered himself a mediocre pilot. “And I thought that was a bad thing to be,” he said. More than risk, Dolson is drawn to challenge — the challenge of pushing himself and a race car to the limits, or learning to sail, navigate, and maintain a sailboat as a way of life. “There is joy in doing something well,” he said. “There is challenge in learning new skills and there’s satisfaction from meeting that challenge.” And a fellow rider recently told him about a wheel that does 45 mph… Jim Cornelius is editor in chief of The Nugget and author of “Warriors of the Wildlands: True Tales of the Frontier Partisans.” A history buff, he explores frontier history across three centuries and several continents on his podcast, The Frontier Partisans.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:04 pm The Stegasaurus was an armored vegetarian dinosaur from 120 million years ago that was 26 feet long and weighed 8 to 10 tons, with a brain the size of a walnut. Dinosaurs lurk in an old-growth rain forest with 350-year-old trees, lush ferns and foliage plants. Kids, trailed by parents taking photos, excitedly follow a hand-drawn map from 40 years ago through the park that contains 23 life-size, prehistoric reptiles tucked amidst and sometimes towering above the abundant growth of native plants. Both plants and dinosaurs have a long history at this place located halfway between Gold Beach and Port Orford on U.S. Highway 101. These two life-size dinosaurs greet passersby and visitors in front of Prehistoric Gardens. The Tyrannosaurus rex and Brachiosaurus are hard to miss when driving between Gold Beach and Port Orford on U.S. Highway 101. Prehistoric Gardens, after 65 years in business, is still a famous roadside attraction that is now owned and managed by Kiki McGrath. The site is a labor of love of McGrath’s family since opening in 1955. Her grandfather, Ernie Nelson, at the age of 47, and his wife Kari sold his accounting business and their Eugene home in the early 1950s to purchase the original 77 acres, according to the documentary “Strange Inheritance: Dino Park.” Nelson dreamed of creating a roadside attraction filled with dinosaurs. “When you have an absolute passion for something, you think other people feel the same way you do,” said his daughter Bennii Worthington in the documentary. The gamble paid off as the U.S. highway system was developed, travel by auto became popular, and roadside attractions were prolific and popular. McGrath says during the summer season, visitors still number 200 a day. The life-size dinosaurs are constructed with steel frames with metal lathe that is molded over the frame, then they are plastered with cement and painted. The first sculpture Nelson made, and the largest, is a Brachiosaurus that is 46 feet tall and 86 feet long. It took him 4 years to build it and required constructing a scaffold to do the work. “The Brachiosaurus was his pride and joy,” said McGrath, pointing to a framed photo of him standing beneath the creature between its front legs. An interpretive sign informs guests that the largest dinosaur’s live weight was estimated to be 85 tons, and he was a plant-eater from the Cretaceous period — about 125 million years ago. The park signage provides fun facts about each of the sculptures, as well as all the indigenous plants. A spring-fed creek meanders through the grounds, with an accessible path that winds past each vignette. Nelson engineered the sculptures based on his drawings of skeletal remains and fossils found and placed in natural history museums. “He always drew,” Worthington said in the documentary. “He came out of the womb with a pen.” Over 30 years, Nelson constructed 23 dinosaurs. While the sculptures are scientifically correct, the paint colors were designed to be fanciful, attractive and photogenic as a tourist attraction. “People would ask him ‘How did you know what colors they were?’ and he said, ‘Well no one knows. It’s the artist behind the paintbrush.’ Birds are very colorful, lizards are very colorful, but we don’t know,” McGrath said. With an average rainfall of between 6 and 10 feet per year, ferns grow to gigantic size and even the common skunk cabbage develops huge tropical leaves. Known as a temperate zone rainforest, this primeval garden developed because of its location; nestled in a valley pocket and therefore protected from the fierce winter storms that sweep the Pacific. The lush primeval garden in a rainforest attracts visitors from near and far to experience dinosaurs from a bygone era of kitsch. The landscaping requires a lot of upkeep. “You don’t have to water anything but we do have to cut things back when it starts growing,” she said. “Some of the skunk cabbage leaves get to be about 7 feet tall.” The dinosaurs also have upkeep. During a wind storm over the winter, one of the giant trees fell in the park on two of the sculptures. They are in the process of being repaired. A small gift shop on the property has souvenirs for dinosaur lovers of all ages, from plush toys and coloring books for kids to fossils, agates, apparel and more for “kids” of all ages. Over the years, family members have helped operate the park. McGrath’s mother worked in the gift shop for a long time, and her uncle helped with building some of the park’s features. McGrath has worked at the park for 40 years. “It’s a lot of work,” she said. Her grandparents have been gone for 21 years. According to “Strange Inheritance,” Nelson passed away in 1999 at the age of 91. His wife Kari died soon afterward. The property was left to McGrath, her mother and her uncle. The property was listed for sale, but Kiki decided she didn’t want to sell the park. The acreage was split up, with 33 acres containing the park going to Kiki. The other 44 acres sold for $1.6 million. “I’d like to keep the legacy going,” McGrath said. She is confident that her daughter and son would keep it going after she retires. The park is open daily in winter (except during extreme weather) from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and until 6 p.m. in summer. To learn more, visit www.prehistoricgardens.com. View our 5/29/24 E-Edition here!

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Reported by Jen Wright The George Fox University (GFU) Swim Team wrapped up their second competitive season at the Northwest Conference Championships (NWCC) on Feb. 16 by improving on last year, with the women placing 6th and the men placing 8th overall. During the four-day meet, the Bruins set 19 new school records, broke four American records, and took home two NWC titles. Junior Aspen Monkhouse won gold in the 50-yard Freestyle and Freshman Adin Williams broke his fifth S6 American record in the 100-yard Butterfly, his second in two days. Williams has also been named to the U.S. Paralympic Swimming National Team, with the possibility of traveling to Tokyo in June to compete. Williams won five gold medals at the U.S. Paralympic Nationals in December. With an influx of freshman recruits, the team was more excited during the swim season, Head Coach Natalie Turner said. “I think what a lot of teams find when they get a big freshman class is that there’s just a lot of fun and excitement,” Turner said. “It’s been really good that they came in in the second year of the program, as we’re still developing, and they’re really setting up kind of a fun culture.” Having spent a year competing together already, the rest of the team is more comfortable with each other. This made it easier for the new swimmers to assimilate, and made the whole season more enjoyable for everyone, including the coaches, Turner said. “Just being able to start off with one group of swimmers who have had one year’s experience together, it really changed the beginning of the year,” Turner said. “They’re wanting to hang out together, eating together, being together outside of the pool before the season’s even started.” The team’s second season didn’t only bring a closer dynamic, but also more talent and more speed. The season’s largest margin of victory was against Pacific University in their first dual meet of the season, sweeping the competition and ending 286-74 overall. After last year’s uncertainty in first-time college swim competition, the Bruins were able to confidently focus on getting good times and aiming for personal bests, Turner said. “When a team does well as a whole, we get to celebrate the entire team, but we get to celebrate individual victories as well,” Turner said. “It really is a cool back-and-forth that we get to play on both the individual and the team aspect of the sport.” Freshman Hunter Bartoo, Photo by George Fox University'}]"

drivers or anything else that’ll pay the bills,” said Eli Ronick, an adjunct faculty member in the Department of World Languages and Literatures at Portland State and Chair of Membership for Portland State University Faculty Association (PSUFA). “Many adjuncts communicate to me they are on some form of social welfare or find themselves one cancelled class away from not being able to pay rent or provide for their families,” Ronick said. According to NPR, adjuncts across the country typically make between $20,000–25,000 annually. Across the spectrum, this has led to financial horror stories from a variety of professors. In 2016, adjunct professors taught 47% of all classes at PSU. Being an adjunct professor in the American university system is no simple task. Adjuncts at PSU face a multitude of challenges, including unstable income, fear of job security and anxiety over being able to teach subjects they care deeply about. “I guess for me a major challenge is pursuing my profession—the only job I’ve ever had that I really enjoyed and felt like I was really good at—in a context where I don’t actually get to be a professional,” stated Jarrod Dunham, an adjunct professor in the English department at PSU. “It’s hard to really feel professionalized in a position where you’re arbitrarily kept from working full-time. It can be near impossible to pursue the research side of my field, which is the area where most of us originally found our passion and demonstrated our chops.” “One of the most painful aspects of being an adjunct is learning the stories from other adjuncts about the levels of disrespect they have experienced throughout their careers,” said Ariana Jacob, an adjunct professor in the PSU School of Art and Design. “I’ve met many adjuncts who worked hard to create whole programs for their department only to have someone else be hired into the full-time position that they built. Some of those adjuncts then lost their jobs altogether—others were asked to continue working part-time while the new full-time hire stepped into the role they worked so hard to create.” Adjuncts are only allowed to operate in a part-time capacity, often so universities aren’t required to pay benefits, like health insurance. According to Jacob, the highest yearly salary most adjuncts can make at PSU is $23,468. As a result, some adjuncts split their time between various schools. Outside of PSU, Jacob teaches at Pacific Northwest College of the Arts, paired with support from her work as an artist and other side gigs. However, “I would not be able to survive on my income in Portland at this point were it not for the added support from my partner,” Jacob said. Dunham also teaches as an adjunct at Portland Community College. “In the past, I’ve taught at PCC Rock Creek, University of Portland and Clackamas Community College,” Dunham stated. “I’ve always taught at at least two schools simultaneously; for one year I was teaching at three.” Jessie Herrada Nance, an adjunct professor in the English department at PSU, also works as an adjunct at PCC in order to make ends meet. According to Nance, working as an adjunct has made it particularly difficult to raise her child. “It’s hard having to split my time between schools,” Nance said. “I’d like to have the chance to put down roots somewhere and have more time to contribute to the campus community. Having to balance teaching at multiple campuses with childcare makes it hard for me to contribute at the level I would like to.” “My first years teaching at PSU, I made so little money that I qualified for the Oregon Health Plan,” Jacob said. “But once I was making more than $16,000 per year, I didn’t qualify for OHP anymore, and it was really scary to not have any support from PSU in accessing affordable health insurance.” In an effort to improve conditions for adjunct faculty, many part-time professors are involved with PSUFA. With 40.8% active members, PSUFA represents about 1,500 part-time faculty members every academic year. Dunham is a steward for PSUFA, operating as a liaison for adjuncts in his department looking for support from the union. Jacob plays a critical role as the chair of bargaining for PSUFA. The union’s primary goals are raising adjunct pay to match the lowest paid full-time faculty, supporting access to affordable healthcare and creating real job security, according to Jacob. “Adjuncts love teaching and depend on this work,” Jacob said. “We need to be able to depend on PSU. We are also advocating for more state funding for higher education to make it more affordable for students. As adjuncts, we know what it is like to live with the burden of student debt and we are committed to ending the student debt crisis. Affordable public higher education is necessary for a democratic society, so we all need to work to change the system so higher ed is adequately supported.” Ronick is the Chair of Membership for PSUFA. His work entails talking with fellow adjuncts about their experiences at PSU and informing them of the benefits of joining the union. Herrada Nance is also a member of PSUFA, whose biggest concern is healthcare. “Right now, members of the union are working as part of a joint task force with members of university administration, who are researching how to support adjuncts’ access to affordable healthcare,” Nance said. “This would be huge for my family. Right now, we depend on the health insurance my spouse gets from his employer. If anything happened to his job, we would struggle to find affordable health insurance.” When asked about the status of adjunctification at large in America, part-time professors tend to agree; it is a crisis. With COVID-19 affecting nearly every aspect of the American workforce, these teachers are fearful of the impacts it will have on their profession. “What I know is a lot of adjuncts across the country have already lost their jobs and many, many more are likely to lose them soon,” Jacob said. “We already know PSU is projecting adjunct and grad assistant cuts for next year. Even though adjuncts cost schools so much less to employ than full-time faculty, our jobs will be cut first because the adjunct portion of a school’s budget is considered disposable.” “Many universities are already struggling financially,” Herrada Nance said. “I’m worried hiring freezes and other economic issues will push more universities to depend on part-time contracts to cover their teaching needs. Depending on part-time work to cover a large percent of classes is not a sustainable long-term solution, and I am concerned this will worsen the trend of adjunctification in the U.S.” While the current pandemic has incited a great deal of anxiety among adjuncts, many believe it isn’t the root of the problem. Instead, they view it as an event that has exposed systematic economic problems inside and outside the university system. “In the bigger picture, the adjunct crisis is a manifestation or iteration of other things we’re seeing in our society: the emergence of the gig economy, the increasing financial need among most American workers for credentials beyond a high school diploma and the general trend toward privatization in our society,” Dunham stated. “The gig economy is a phenomenon that far predates COVID-19,” Ronick said. “For years, universities nationwide have cut tenure-track and full-time positions in favor of adjuncts while at the same time implementing steep tuition hikes for students. During this same period, upper administration salaries across the country have ballooned to large six-figure sums. Until we are adequately compensated for the work we do, adjuncts will continue to be treated as cheap and expendable labor by universities, trends that will be heightened by pandemics or any other market downturn.” Every spring, PSUFA negotiates with the university regarding policies for the following academic year. The union recently published “The Adjunct Experience Letters,” a collection of personal stories from a variety of part-time professors. PSUFA hopes these letters will shed light on the dire nature of the adjunct crisis at PSU, facilitating positive changes to the university’s adjunct policies. Jacob believes there are five key components to fixing the adjunct crisis. First, taxing wealth and business to cultivate consistent revenue for public higher education. Second, capping all public higher education salaries at a reasonable amount. Third, bundling classes taught by adjuncts into full-time positions with benefits. Fourth, labor law reform that benefits gig workers, and fifth, electing officials who will institute universal health coverage. “Around 50 PSU administrators and other employees make over $150,000 per year in salary, while student workers, staff and adjuncts are told there is no money for raises,” Jacob said about the salary cap.

News of the sweep reached the council during its weekly workshop at City Hall on Monday. Councilor DJ Faszer subsequently persuaded his colleagues to hash out the twin subject of sanitation and the future of the part of the park near Caveman Bridge where the encampment is located during Wednesday night's regularly scheduled business meeting. Controversy about the homeless encampment came to a head Monday morning, when the Department of Public Safety systematically began telling campers they had to go. By 11:15, only a few tents were still standing. Campers piled belongings on sidewalks along Sixth Street by Caveman Bridge, and over on nearby Lewis Avenue, trying to get rides to another spot. The encampment sprung up weeks ago and had grown at one point to nearly 30 tents despite a lack of sanitation facilities but plenty of police patrols that included citations for code violations, such as scattering trash, and occasional arrests for drug offenses. Monday morning officers cleared it out. â\x80\x9cThey just came and rousted us out of our tents and said, â\x80\x98Get out,â\x80\x99â\x80\x9d said Teresa Hanson, a two-month resident. â\x80\x9cIâ\x80\x99m trying to get to Medford and get in a place there.â\x80\x9d Multiple campers said they were told they could come back in the evening. Under a ruling in a federal lawsuit that accused the city of criminalizing homelessness, the city cannot prevent people from camping in public parks at night, but only at night. The city is appealing the ruling, and also now adhering to the letter of the law, which allows camping only at night. Andrew Urenda said he and other campers were warned this would happen five days ago. â\x80\x9cThey told us starting the 28th we had to move off the property between 7:30 a.m. and 6 p.m,â\x80\x9d Urenda said. â\x80\x9cThatâ\x80\x99s ridiculous.â\x80\x9d For more than a week campers have been periodically told to move tents. An officer at the scene, Tim Artoff, declined to comment on Monday morningâ\x80\x99s activities. Public Safety Director Warren Hensman was at the scene briefly. He went to the City Council workshop afterwards and could not be reached immediately for comment. Community service officers were loading up material from a large tent into a pickup, saying it was going to be safely kept. â\x80\x9cWeâ\x80\x99re taking it to our evidence facility,â\x80\x9d said one of them. Sue Wright stood by her taken-down tent, trying to figure out what to do. â\x80\x9cThey said to move our stuff or theyâ\x80\x99ll move it out,â\x80\x9d Wright said. â\x80\x9cThey said we could come back tonight. That sort of defeats the purpose.â\x80\x9d Wright said she received one kind gesture, when an officer charged up her cellphone. The conflict over the homeless camp stems from a federal court ruling earlier this year that hamstrung the city's ability to discourage homeless people from camping overnight in city parks. The decision by U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark D. Clarke built on an earlier ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Martin v. City of Boise that said in the absence of adequate public shelter, homeless people cannot be punished for sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go. Grants Pass does not have a public shelter. The clearing of the park came five days after a portable toilet was set up by citizens to address sanitation issues, but was removed by the city hours later. Department of Public Safety officials have declined to talk about the park situation. City Manager Aaron Cubic last week called sanitation issues at the park a matter for the City Council, including the placement of the portable toilet and its subsequent removal. â\x80\x94â\x80\x94â\x80\x94 Reach reporter Jeff Duewel at 541-474-3720 or jduewel@thedailycourier.com.""}]"

job in Oregon. An inmate at the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem, Dawson, 33, works five days a week at the prison laundry with 180 other co-workers. He makes about 60 cents an hour. The warehouse takes in about 40,000 pounds of laundry each day. The source of those 20 tons of dirty sheets, towels and robes? Thirty-three hospitals and clinics across the state, including Legacy Health and Oregon Health & Science University. Those medical facilities are now at the center of treating COVID-19 patients. And they clean their laundry with prison labor. ""It comes in just as it left the hospital. There\'s no cleaning process that happens before it gets to us,"" Dawson tells WW. ""We know it only takes one person to get the whole [prison] infected. We\'re just stacked on top of each other. It seems like one of the worst places to be in the country [right now]. Working in the laundry gives me more anxiety about that."" Laundry facilities in the states\' prisons are run by Oregon Corrections Enterprises, which is a highly unusual private business operating inside the state Department of Corrections. Because it doesn\'t receive public funding, company spokeswoman Jennifer Starbuck says, it is not legally required to disclose who its three-dozen customers are. (Starbuck says all its clients are health care facilities.) Nor does it need to disclose how much it charges for its services, or what its profits are. Throughout the pandemic, Oregon\'s prison laundries have continued to accept soiled linens from hospitals across the state with few changes to working conditions. Workers at these laundry facilities, mostly inmates at Two Rivers Correctional Institution in Umatilla and the Oregon State Penitentiary, get paid between $90 and $100 a month for working full time. This breaks down to roughly 60 cents an hour. ""At this time, the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is not recommending any changes to the current processing standards for the commercial laundry industry,"" Starbuck said in a statement to WW, adding that there is a higher risk of exposure from direct person-to-person contact than through contaminated objects. Starbuck added that the corrections department has increased its frequency of cleaning laundry facilities, and that one major hospital sent an infectious disease control team to inspect prison laundries this month: ""No major concerns were identified, only minor adjustments."" A spokeswoman for Oregon Health & Science University tells WW the hospital has been using Oregon Corrections Enterprises\' laundry service since 1995, and that the two entities work together ""through processes designed to protect patients, employees and laundry workers."" Legacy spokeswoman Kristin Whitney tells WW its hospital in Silverton, Ore., has used the prison laundry service for 16 years. Providence spokeswoman Kathleen Obenland says Providence St. Mary\'s in Walla Walla, Wash., has sent its laundry to Two Rivers since September 2015. ""For questions about the safety of prisoners at Two Rivers and the precautions being taken in the laundry there, please contact [them] directly,"" Obenland said. Concerns about the effects of COVID-19 on inmates have received widespread press in Oregon over the past month. But hospital use of prison labor has received less attention. Because of Measure 17, passed by voters in 1994, inmates in Oregon must keep working full time. Some of that work keeps the prisons running: mopping floors and cooking meals. But other work is contracted out through Oregon Corrections Enterprises to sell products and services to outside entities. Inmates can request to switch jobs, but the process is often lengthy and convoluted, lawyers tell WW. ""You have people being paid pennies on the dollar,"" says Juan Chavez, project director of the Oregon Justice Rights Center, ""and a state constitutional mandate that they do that work. The consequences of not working results in disciplinary punishment."" Dan White, an inmate at Two Rivers Correctional Facility, says he\'s frightened by the work. ""I can\'t quit. Measure 17 means I have to be compliant with worker programs,"" says White, 38. ""I\'m worried that I won\'t make it back out to my family. I wasn\'t sent to die in here."" In the state penitentiary\'s laundry room, an assembly line of men in light green and blue gowns place the soiled linens—sheets, scrubs, surgical gowns, towels—into four massive washing machines, each about 10 feet tall and 4 feet wide. Workers touching soiled laundry wear masks and gowns to do the laundry, Dawson says, which is the same personal protective equipment they wore prior to the pandemic. White, who folds clean laundry, says he doesn\'t get any PPE to do his job. ""We\'re standing right next to the soil room, so all that air blows on top of you,"" White says. ""They don\'t have us socially distanced. We\'re just crammed in a little room. There\'s like 80 of us. I look over, and there\'s four dudes from the soil room wearing the scrubs. Like, really, dude?"" In response to an inquiry from WW, the governor\'s office said it has instructed the ODOC director to ensure facilities are equipped with PPE. ""Adults in custody who work in the OCE laundry are providing a vital service at a time when the demand from hospitals is high,"" Brown spokeswoman Liz Merah says. ""Their work—which DOC is ensuring continues safely—is helping to keep our frontline health care workers safe during this critical time."" White, who makes $100 a month doing laundry, says he and his co-workers feel they\'re being exploited to help hospitals function. ""We\'re providing essential services to these workers during this critical time. I\'m facing the potential of a deadly virus getting into my environment and me dying in prison,"" White says. ""Hell, it would even be nice to have an urn of coffee down there.""
