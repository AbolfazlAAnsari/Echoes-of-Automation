some indication the COVID virus, which has overwhelmed Cleveland hospitals in recent weeks, is moving south in Ohio. State Health Director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff says hospitalizations have fallen as much as 24% in Cleveland this week. But he says other parts of the state are experiencing an increase in COVID hospitalizations. “The Southwest region of Ohio reported a 14% increase and the western Ohio region a 13% increase in ICU admissions for patients with COVID-19 compared with last week,” Vanderhoff says. It's Omicron, not the Delta variant, that is driving the surge Vanderhoff says this surge has been driven by the Omicron variant of the virus. While it is highly contagious and far easier to spread, he says it has proven to be milder in vaccinated people. But he says more than 90% of those Ohioans who have been hospitalized have been unvaccinated. So, he explains it's important for all Ohioans to stay home if they have cold symptoms because it could be COVID. And though it might be mild for vaccinated Ohioans, it could be dangerous for unvaccinated Ohioans or those who are immunocompromised. Almost 60% of Ohioans 5 years old and older who are eligible for COVID vaccines are fully vaccinated at this point. Resources are being shifted because of the surge For weeks now, Ohio National Guard members, along with federal Air Force professionals, have been working at the Cleveland Clinic. The hospital has been hard hit by the Omicron surge during the holidays and the weeks following. Vanderhoff says federally deployed military professionals will continue to help in Cleveland and adds the feds will be sending some additional help to the Summa system in Akron in the coming days. And because the surge is moving south, Adjutant General Major Gen. John Harris Jr. says the Ohio Natl Guard will shift to Southern and Southwest Ohio to deal with the increasing hospitalizations there. Dr. Roberto Colon with the Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton says his facility is feeling the stress of the surge right now. He says the hospital has taken steps to increase capacity by putting off elective surgery and making other changes. He says the health care workers there are very happy to have the Ohio Natl Guard members there and their work has been very much appreciated by staff. It's still tough to find rapid at-home tests Vanderhoff says the state has received a fraction of the 1.2 million at-home tests it ordered for January. But he says the state expects to get 400,000 in the near future. Those will be given to K-12 schools and colleges. When they have enough, Vanderhoff says the tests will, once again, be supplied to libraries and health departments statewide that can hand them out free of charge to Ohioans. Libraries had been doing that from March 2021 until just a couple of weeks ago when the state shifted the priority for those tests to schools. The rapid tests have been in short supply nationally in recent weeks. But the Biden administration announced each household in the country can order four free COVID tests at covidtests.gov. Those tests will be mailed through the U.S. Postal Service in the coming days. In addition, people with private insurance can be reimbursed up to $12 a test from their private insurer if they purchase the tests at a pharmacy. And Vanderhoff says Ohioans can also go to one of the mass testing sites throughout the state to have a test administered. A complete list of those locations can be found here. When will this surge end? Vanderhoff says there are encouraging signs right now but notes there are still a lot of people in hospitals with COVID. He points out Ohio continues to record an average of more than 20,000 positive case numbers daily, a number he describes as very high. He also explains there are other variants out there that could pose problems in the future. He says vaccination continues to be the safest way to combat the virus. Even though the vaccines might not be enough to keep people from getting COVID, Vanderhoff explains they are doing a good job of keeping vaccinated people from getting seriously ill with the virus. As far as case numbers, those have been off in recent days. The Ohio Department of Health reported a backlog in cases that have been added to the state's dashboard in recent days. He says the department has made changes to correct the problem.""}]"

You all know her from Fox & Friends in the morning. She has a new book out.I’m So Glad You Were Born: Celebrating Who You Are. Ainsley, first time in with us. Thanks so much for joining us on the program. EARHARDT: Hey, Buck. Hey, Clay. Thank you all so much. I’m so proud of you all. You’re doing great. BUCK: Thank you. We have a lot of fun. CLAY: We do. BUCK: We are a little tired after last night, which I know you’re never supposed to say on the air, but we were out quite a bit. I went home. EARHARDT: Are you talking about what happened last night? BUCK: I went home. We had a little bit of an engagement party here in New York, and Clay, I must admit, stayed up. Clay is married with three kids; he stayed out later than me. He outpaced me. I got sent home early by the fiancee. CLAY: We had an awesome group of people, and it spiraled into an Irish pub from the engagement party, and it was just a really fun time. BUCK: We took over an Irish pub, apparently. CLAY: We did basically take over an Irish pub. EARHARDT: So for people who are listening that don’t know, the Irish pubs, they’re everywhere in downtown. When I started at Fox News, there was an Irish pub. Before it was torn down for a parking garage, there was this one Irish pub that everyone went to and we had, like, a back room, and that was where all the Fox people would hang out but those are the early years at Fox. It was so fun. CLAY: When did you get to Fox for the first time? EARHARDT: It was 2007. So. CLAY: So you came to Fox from where? EARHARDT: San Antonio, Texas. CLAY: So was it a culture shock for you to suddenly be in New York City? EARHARDT: Well, I’m an East Coaster. I grew up in South Carolina, worked there for five years after college. Came to San Antonio, and I always wanted New York. That was my dream. BUCK: What’s San Antonio like as a city? I always hear people say great things about it like — super safe, family friendly, quality of life very high. EARHARDT: You would love it. There are big parties there. There’s the fiesta there. CLAY: (laughing) BUCK: Clay would have to carry me on his shoulder but, yeah. EARHARDT: Right. A year ago, you would have, like, now you’re engaged and — BUCK: I’m slowing down a little bit, you know. EARHARDT: I’m glad. I’m proud of you. BUCK: Yeah. EARHARDT: No, it was so fun because they love their faith, which is important to me, and they love to party, which is important to me. So it’s the best of both worlds. CLAY: You went to South Carolina. EARHARDT: Exactly. Went to a southern school. CLAY: Yeah, we’re SEC double grads here. EARHARDT: Yeah, yeah. I can’t out as late as I used to but I like to have fun and the faith aspect is great. It was a wonderful place. BUCK: So we have this fabulous book here — EARHARDT: Thank you. BUCK: — that is in studio with us: Celebrating Who You Are. It’s a kids book. EARHARDT: Yes. BUCK: Clay has copies. His kids are a little old maybe for the book? CLAY: The 8-year-old I think could handle this a little bit; so, second grader. I’ve got 14, I’ve got 12, and I’ve got 18. Just had a couple of birthdays so I got make sure I got that right. EARHARDT: I tell you this: This message, though, even if you don’t read this book to them, “I’m so glad you were born,” is something our mom said to us on our birthdays, which if you think about it means a little bit more than just happy birthday, even though happy birthday is great; it’s something you hear every birthday and everyone this it. “I’m so glad you were born,” it’s like, “Okay, wait a minute. I have to stop and think. It’s pretty cool that I was born on this day and I’m gonna make a big difference, and I can change the world.” God can use me and change the world. CLAY: You have a young daughter. EARHARDT: I do. She’s six and a half. CLAY: How much did that motivate want to go write a children’s book? EARHARDT: You know what it’s like as a parent. You have three boys. CLAY: Yeah. That’s right. EARHARDT: So six and a half. Mystery two books, my first two children’s books were lyrical and like sappy sweet when I was going through when I was pregnant, I was so glad I had her and we had gone through a lot, I try to get did pregnant, I had a miscarriage and then three months later I conceived Hayden; so I knew why I’d gone through that bad place ’cause I wouldn’t have Hayden if it weren’t for that really tough time. And this book is just about now I’m six and a half years past that and how much I love being a mom. It’s so fun. I just want her to come home. You know, we all grew up in the generation where our parents were so tough. And I grew up in South Carolina. There were spankings, you know, not too hard. I was a girl, and — CLAY: You know what a switch is. EARHARDT: Yes, I do. Take it out, right? Actually, my mom used a fly swatter and my dad one time on me used a belt, usually was his hand, and it hurt him more than it hurt me, and I saw that; I knew that. But it was rare. My brother, however, probably every day. But now – CLAY: (laughing) He probably deserved it too. EARHARDT: He did, he did. Now we work and that’s just not the way that we punish our children. It’s more time-out. I’m grateful that I have a really fairly easy child to raise. So and then just kind of raise my voice a little bit, she calls it “the dark voice,” I feel like Darth Vader. And then she starts crying. But I love her so much. And we just have fun. We have dance parties in the kitchen; so she picked out the illustrator for this book. We put all the pictures on the floor of the illustrators that the publisher sent me that were available at the time. And so I said, Hayden, which one do you like? And thankfully she picked the one you was really drawn to. So this is our illustrator, Kim Barnes, and Hayden loves this one picture in the book. Hayden, we talked to the illustrator about the dance parties and how important they were to share the dance parties in the kitchen, ‘cause that’s where we have ours and kind of they trail off into the living room. But this illustrator drew a picture of a fence in the backyard, in their backyard, and she lets her children paint, use real paint on the fence. And it covers the whole backyard. Like, my dad would have — CLAY: Lost his mind. EARHARDT: I definitely would have gotten the belt for that one, right? But, yeah, so, my daughter said, “I really want to do that,” and I’m like, “Well, we rent a house out in Long Island from one of my friends, and she probably would kick us out if we painted her fence.” So we’re not doing that. But I just love the illustrator, I love the message, and I’m at the end of the book the children yell out “I’m so glad I was born.” You’re about to go through this. You just got engaged. BUCK: No, I know. Give me a copy because — EARHARDT: Yeah I’m gonna. BUCK: — I’m gonna start leafing through this. I do have a… It’s actually perfect ’cause I was talking before about my 2-year-old nephew. EARHARDT: Awww. BUCK: His name is Ryan, and he is absolutely amazing, and I’ve never really spent time around — CLAY: Kids that age. BUCK: — a small person like that. Oh, it’s so much fun. EARHARDT: Is it?
