Aides in a series of social media posts took direct aim at news stories and headlines — even those from left-leaning publications — relating to the 80-year-old president’s age, suggesting it was a lazy narrative that ignored Biden’s marathon trip in Asia over the last five days. “Hanging in the basement,” Herbie Ziskend, the deputy communications director wrote in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, along with a photo of Biden’s schedule for Monday, when he was set to spend the morning in Vietnam and the afternoon in Alaska before landing in Washington after midnight. Ziskend was referring to a campaign attack used by former President Trump’s team in 2020 that Biden was running for president from his basement because he was using the pandemic as an excuse to hide his lack of stamina due to his age. The X post was in response to an Axios story from a few days earlier that suggested both Biden and Trump are “running basement-esque campaigns in 2024” with limited public events. Principal deputy press secretary Olivia Dalton took issue with a CNN headline that highlighted an awkward end to Biden’s press conference Sunday in Hanoi in which press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre interrupted him while Biden was still responding to a shouted question from a reporter in the room. “Here on Earth, we saw the President start his day in India at the G20, end the day in Hanoi with a substantive & detailed 40-minute press conference at 9pm, and continue to answer questions—including from @cnn—as he departed. What will be enough?” Dalton wrote on X. The attacks by the White House even targeted left-leaning publications seen as friendlier to Democrats. White House Communications Director Ben LaBolt mocked a Daily Beast headline that focused on how Biden concluded his press conference at 9:30 p.m. local time in Vietnam by saying he was going to bed. “Presidents shall never sleep. Not even at night after days of marathon meetings overseas. Sage guidance from The Daily Beast. Next up in the series: Presidents shall never eat,” LaBolt wrote on X. In a rare occurrence, Jean-Pierre complimented Fox News’s Peter Doocy, whom she often tangles with at press briefings, for telling viewers Biden had been pulling “the equivalent of an all-nighter” Sunday when he started the day in India with meetings and ended it in Vietnam with a press conference. “Thank you, Peter,” Jean-Pierre said in response. For Biden allies, the president’s trip from Washington, D.C., to India for the Group of 20 (G20) summit, then to Vietnam to meet with government and business leaders, to Alaska for a 9/11 memorial ceremony and back to Washington, was proof that the 80-year-old president can handle the rigors of the job. Biden met with leaders from India, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia and other countries at the G20. He also announced a new comprehensive strategic partnership with Vietnam, meeting with government and business leaders in Hanoi. The president himself nodded to the nonstop schedule during his press conference in Vietnam on Sunday. “Good evening, everyone. It is evening, isn’t it?” Biden said at the top of his remarks. Biden and White House officials often faced questions about whether the president is up for the demands of a second term for months. But it’s not just the media making it a focus — several national polls have indicated the issue isn’t going away amid repeated attacks by Republicans on the matter. Biden, the oldest person to ever be sworn in as president, would be 86 at the end of a potential second term.

naloxone vending machines will be placed in several counties across Kansas by the end of the year. The machines will be in Douglas, Johnson and Wyandotte counties in northeast Kansas. They’ll also be placed in Crawford County in the southeast part of the state, and Reno and Sedgwick counties in south-central Kansas. “Our goal is really to eliminate as many barriers as possible to getting naloxone in the hands of people,” said Chrissy Mayer with DCCCA, a nonprofit that helps distribute naloxone. “So this is just … one more way to equip people with a lifesaving drug essentially.” Vending machines have become one of the latest tools in the fight against the opioid crisis. Residents can access the naloxone by simply putting in their ZIP codes. Fentanyl test strips will also be available for free in the machines. “What we're hearing is if people go to purchase [naloxone] over the counter, they're paying anywhere from $40 to $50 for a kit, which makes it very difficult to purchase if you're choosing between gas for the week or Naloxone,” Mayer said. “It's a tough choice.” The machines are part of DCCCA’s statewide naloxone access program. The agency also mails naloxone kits and fentanyl test strips to any Kansas resident for free. Mayer said some of the counties were chosen because they were the biggest utilizers of the naloxone program. From there, the agency said it would rely on data and its local partners on where the vending machine should be placed outdoors. The locations have yet to be announced, but Mayer said the machines will be outside for 24-hour access. “We really are trying to focus on areas of high need and where our local partners think it will be most utilized best,” Mayer said. Funding for the vending machines comes from several different means, including a donation from the Healthy Blue initiative and state and local opioid settlement funds. A vending machine in Wyandotte County, which has seen a steep increase in overdose deaths since 2018 like several other parts of the state, was recently awarded funding through the state opioid settlement grants. “This is something that can immediately save a life,” said Pat George, the chair of the board allocating money from the state’s opioid settlement funds. Discussion for the vending machine has been ongoing with Douglas County’s local government and will be funded with its share of opioid settlement grants, The Lawrence Times reports. Healthy Blue, an initiative from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas, will fund the rest of the machines through DCCCA and help continue supplying the machines with naloxone. “With the funding from Healthy Blue, it really was just to determine, are the machines being utilized? Are people receptive to them? Does that help reduce things like stigma? Does it normalize Naloxone usage?” Mayer said. “We're really just waiting to see, kind of, how it's received in Kansas.” Once the machines are placed, residents can find their locations at dccca.org/naloxone-program.""}]"

The Transportation Security Administration said Wednesday that this holiday season is shaping up to be one of its busiest on record. While large airport crowds are far beyond your control, you can help ease slowdowns by avoiding some common mistakes. A recent study from USA TODAY Blueprint, the news outlet’s financial team, identified the top three mishaps people experience at TSA checkpoints. Experts surveyed 5,000 Americans in October 2023 who have traveled by air within the past five years. Passengers forgetting to take off their belts or shoes at security checkpoints is considered the most common mistake, with 28% of survey respondents admitting this, according to the study. The second common mistake? About 28% of respondents also confessed to going through a metal detector with a phone, jewelry, keys or similar object. Not removing electronics from carry-on bags fell last on the list, with 23% of respondents confessing to this hiccup. The Blueprint survey also ranked the U.S. states that have the most inefficient air travelers, based on questions related to the following categories: security checkpoints, general preparedness, and luggage packing. North Carolina ranked No. 1 as the most inefficient state when it comes to passing through checkpoints, while New Mexico was deemed the most efficient. Apart from the study, Thomas Carter, TSA’s federal security director for New Jersey, said the agency has also seen a lot of travelers arrive at checkpoints with drinks and knives. “Finish that bottle of water, energy drink or cup of coffee before you get to the checkpoint,” he said. “Pack the larger shampoo, toothpaste, sunblock and hair gel in a checked bag. As for knives, if you must travel with a knife, please pack it in your checked bag.” Other helpful travel tips from the TSA include arriving to the airport at least two hours early, knowing which items are prohibited from traveling with, and properly packing food and gifts.
