BARR\'S REALITY Former Attorney General William Barr\'s recorded testimony that he found Trump ""detached from reality"" with some of his claims about election fraud was the lead in several news stories about Monday\'s hearing.

There\'s no count of how many times it was repeated on cable news, or estimate of how many people saw it that way. Two anecdotal examples illustrate the extent to which it was seen online.

Twitter posts of the video uploaded by MSNBC and the committee itself got more than 900,000 views together.

Kushner\'s halting response when asked about what he had said to his father-in-law about Giuliani — as if he was weighing in real time what it meant to be under oath — became fodder for jokes. NEW STAR Previously little-known, former White House attorney Eric Herschmann has become a breakout star this past week for his filmed testimony concerning his conversations with John Eastman, architect of Trump\'s failed maneuvering to hold onto power. Editing his own colorful language, Herschmann recalls saying ""are you out of your effing mind?"" when Eastman talks the day after the Capitol riot about a potential appeal of Georgia election results. Like a stern parent, he tells Eastman that the only words he wants to hear from him are ""orderly transition"" and advises him to ""get a great f-ing criminal defense lawyer.

Currently the academic concept is not taught in Pennsylvania schools. “On day one, no boys on the girls team … no boys in the girls bathrooms,” he said. “We’re going to be a law and order state. On day one we’re no longer a sanctuary state. We will not play host to any illegals in Pennsylvania.” Mastriano’s wife, Rebbie Mastriano, also spoke about women’s rights in Pennsylvania. “Republicans do believe in women’s rights,” she said. “We believe in a woman\'s right to be born … to have a say in her child’s education. We believe that a woman should have access to baby formula and affordable groceries for their family.” She said that Republicans believe in a woman’s right to raise their children in safe communities where the government enforces the law and prosecutes crime. Dr. Mehmet Oz, a television personality and retired cardiothoracic surgeon, is running for U.S. Senate against Democrat and current Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman. “Our nation needs to be brave more than ever,” he said. “The only thing Joe Biden has built back better is the Republican party.” The large crowd filled into the arena’s upper and lower level seats as well as around the speakers’ podium on the floor. Most in the audience wore red, white and blue t-shirts and gear supporting Trump, matching the motif of the arena which is draped in American Flags. The crowd danced to music playing in the arena during breaks in between speakers. They did the wave for television cameras and clapped to the Village People’s “Y.M.C.A.” They chanted ""Lets Go Brandon"" and ""U.S.A."" while waiting for Trump to speak. State Treasurer Stacy Gerrity opened the rally. Cynthia Hughes and Geri Perna spoke on behalf of their nephews who were charged with offenses related to the Jan. 6 insurrection. Perna’s nephew, Matthew Perna, died by suicide in February. U.S. Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene, from Georgia, and Dan Meuser, from Pennsylvania\'s ninth congressional district, also spoke. Meuser is running for reelection. Greene came on stage to a huge round of applause. She said the recent raid of Trump’s Mar-a-lago home in Florida was a violation of his rights. “This is the type of America that all of us have nightmares about, “ she said. “We have to hold them accountable.” To do so, she called on the crowd to elect Mastriano. “Pennsylvania you have a job to do,” she said. “This November it\'s freedom versus tyranny on the ballot.” Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation is warning motorists to expect delays disruptions on I-81 northbound between exit 180 and exit 168 from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. Highland Park Boulevard will be closed to traffic during Trump’s arrival and departure.
