Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:46 pm Cleveland County deputies escort Max Townsend, on June 18, out of Judge Walkley’s court. The state continued its case in the Moore hit-and-run trial early this week, calling witnesses, first responders and coaches to the stand for an emotional two days of testimony. Max Townsend is charged with three counts of second degree murder for hitting multiple cross country and track students outside Moore High School on Feb. 3, 2020. Townsend’s defense is not denying he was behind the wheel or that the accident happened; Townsend’s attorneys say he choked on a Red Bull, passed out and lost control of his car. The state, meanwhile, has worked over the last week to establish that Townsend was conscious and in control when he hit the runners. Four state witnesses have testified they saw Townsend with both hands on the wheel sitting up prior to the crash; two testified they saw him with his eyes open. On Monday, Reagan Thaxton, a Moore High School graduate who was on the track team when the hit-and-run occurred, emotionally relived the day her friends were killed. Later that night, they were supposed to go to their senior banquet, but they never made it, she said. Thaxton testified that as she left the field house that day, she saw “socks and shoes” scattered across the road. Thaxton said she remembers seeing Kolby Crum in the middle of the road with his shoes and socks scattered. She was running toward him when she realized Rachel Freeman was lying motionless on the ground. As she approached Freeman, Thaxton noticed her body and hips were in “a weird placement.” “I ran up and asked if anyone had checked for a pulse,” Thaxton said. “They just looked at me and didn’t really say anything. So, I moved her body into a somewhat normal position and I checked for a pulse. I don’t remember feeling one.” When she couldn’t find a pulse, Thaxton said she began two rounds of CPR, stopping only when her coach pulled her off of Freeman. Moore Police Officer Justin Sternburg — who immediately classified Freeman as “high priority” — then continued CPR on Freeman, only to stop once he realized her “chest cavity has collapsed.” “She’s gone, she’s crushed,” he said in body camera footage shown in court. Sternburg started crying while on the stand as he told the jury “there was nothing we could do” and there were no signs of life in Freeman. “My focus was primarily Rachel Freeman until she passed,” he said. Chris Edwards, the MHS assistant wrestling coach and a Mustang firefighter, sprinted out of the field house down to the scene of the wreckage. His instincts as a firefighter jumped into action and he began to conduct triage on all the victims, he said. Crum and Yuridia Martinez were coded red for critical. Freeman was coded black for deceased. Crum died in the hospital less than two weeks later. “There were no signs of life in Rachel,” Edwards said. After conducting triage, Edwards ran to Martinez, who had been dragged out of the pond, and began breathing for her with a breathing bag. Edwards continued to breathe for Martinez until she was dropped off at the hospital. Martinez died the next morning. The two students who chased down Townsend’s truck after he hit students and crashed into other vehicles testified that when they approached the vehicle, Townsend was “fiddling with the keys” trying to start the car to drive away. MHS senior Evan Biedermann opened the driver’s side door, where Townsend was trying to start the car, and senior Dillon Erven reached in to grab the keys from the ignition. Erven threw Townsend’s keys down the street, the students testified. On Tuesday, the first police officer on the scene, Sgt. David Grant with the MPD, testified about the field sobriety tests he conducted on Townsend. Grant said he could smell alcohol on Townsend, and decided to conduct the test. The field sobriety test, Grant said, is not a pass/fail test. Instead, it’s meant to give officers “clues” as to whether or not the person might be inebriated. On the nystagmus test, a test that looks for a “jolt” in the eye that occurs whenever someone is intoxicated, Townsend showed six of the six potential clues for someone who might be inebriated, Grant said. Blood tests from the hospital show that Townsend’s blood alcohol content level was .06, which is below the legal limit of .08. Those same blood tests showed Townsend had traces of THC in his system. On arrival to the Cleveland County Detention Center, Townsend told the nurse conducting his intake report that he had “used marijuana the day before” the hit-and-run, and that he had “drank the day of the crash.” The court also heard from a highway patrol officer who testified about Townsend’s 2013 arrest for driving while intoxicated, when he crashed his car on the side of the road and was found walking home. Townsend was not convicted of any charges stemming from the 2013 arrest. The defense argues that Townsend choked on a sip of Red Bull and then passed out, causing him to lose control of his truck. In Grant’s body camera footage, Townsend can be heard repeatedly claiming that he choked. “I just lost my son last night,” Townsend said on the body cam footage. “I was just going to his house when I started choking.” Donna Hanson of Turnkey Health — the medical provider at the Cleveland County Detention Center — said that according to intake reports, Townsend never mentioned choking or passing out when asked. He never visited the medical unit with complaints of choking or passing out when incarcerated at the detention center, she said. The trial resumes at 9 a.m. Wednesday.

TAHLEQUAH – The Cherokee Nation is celebrating the life of Sequoyah and his influence as a cultural icon in a new exhibit at the Cherokee National History Museum. As part of the bicentennial celebration of the Cherokee syllabary, “Sequoyah: An American Icon” shares details about Sequoyah’s historic achievement and its impact on the Cherokee people. The exhibit will run through Dec. 31. “Sequoyah’s legacy continues 200 years after the introduction of the syllabary to the Cherokee people,” said Krystan Moser, manager of cultural collections and exhibits for Cherokee Nation. “This accomplishment, something not done by any other single person in recorded history, has cemented Sequoyah as an icon not just in Cherokee history, but American and even world history.” This exhibit will include a historical biography of Sequoyah, a reproduction of a portrait of him from 1828, samples of his handwriting, proceedings from the dedication of his statue at the U.S. Capitol Statuary Hall and much more. “This exhibit is just part of the programs and events we have lined up as part of the Cherokee syllabary bicentennial celebration,” Moser said. “We hope to educate and entertain the public with Sequoyah’s story and inspire them all to learn more about this true American icon.” Those interested in learning more about the legendary statesman and inventor of the Cherokee syllabary are encouraged to also visit Sequoyah’s Cabin Museum in Sallisaw. The cabin was constructed by Sequoyah in 1829 and was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1966 and a National Literary Landmark in 2006. The homestead includes a one-room cabin and nearly 200 acres. The Cherokee National History Museum is located in one of the tribe’s most iconic structures, the Cherokee National Capitol building. The museum opened in 2019 and shares the history and culture of the Cherokee Nation within 4,000 square feet of permanent exhibit space that features Cherokee lifestyle from pre-European contact through the Trail of Tears and the revitalization of the tribe after the American Civil War.

Johnson, of Allen, will graduate with her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in December. Her senior exhibit will feature graphic design pieces she has worked on throughout her time at ECU, as well as some newer pieces. “I am a Christian, so I feel like God is the reason I make art and design,” Johnson said. “I hope to encourage people with my work. I try to make art that relates to struggles that God has helped me to overcome. All of my art relates to the journey of my faith.” Johnson said her interest in art and graphic design was sparked in elementary school. “For a school career day once I dressed up as a designer, which I thought consisted of wearing a cool V-neck and a bandana,” she said. “I have loved it pretty much all of my life.” Johnson has written and illustrated a children’s book called Tuffany, an obvious play on her own first name and created under the pen name “Tiffany Kayann.” She said artwork from her book will be included in the exhibit. “Throughout my time at ECU as a Fine Arts major, I have found my voice and my confidence. With the love and support of my professors, I have become at home with myself,” she said with a reference to the title of her exhibit. After graduation, Johnson said she would pursue a career in graphic design. “I plan to find a job that can lead to becoming self-employed,” she said. “One of my largest goals is to publish Tuffany.” Johnson’s “At Home with Myself” exhibit is on display in the Pogue Gallery, located inside ECU’s Hallie Brown Ford Fine Arts Center, until December 3. She will host an artist’s reception in the gallery at 6 p.m. on that final day. The gallery is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays. Her exhibit is free and open to the public.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:48 pm Matt Damon stars as Oklahoma oil worker Bill Baker in director Tom McCarthy\'s ""Stillwater"", a Focus Features release. Credit Jessica Forde / Focus Features People living in the middle of the country – sometimes dismissed as “flyover states” – often feel like they don’t get the proper attention or respect from those in major cities and on the coasts, especially the entertainment industry. So the oilfield workers that award-winning actor and writer Matt Damon met were suspicious when he came to Oklahoma to research the character he plays in the upcoming film “Stillwater.” And Damon says he didn’t blame them. “They wanted to be sure we weren’t going to make fun of them,” he told the News Press. But while spending time with them to develop his character Bill Baker and understand roughneck culture, Damon says he grew to like and respect the men working in the oil patch. A photo shows Matt Damon with Kenny Baker, a drilling supervisor who helped him develop his character from accent and pronunciation to what to order at Sonic. Screenshot from a CBS Sunday Morning video Damon said he respects how hard they work and appreciated the way they invited him into their homes and lives. They’re good guys, he said. Their politics are different than his, but he understands why. “They work in the oil business, of course they voted for Trump,” he said. Some entertainment media has made much of what they present as Damon’s newfound understanding of MAGA culture and what Variety called “red-state identity politics.” But Damon says he doesn’t understand their emphasis on that. The movie is ultimately about relationships. His portrayal of Bill is filled with empathy for a character he sees as acting out of love and trying to do what he can to make things right. “Stillwater,” which opens in theaters Friday is sometimes presented as a thriller but Damon said he considers it a drama with some elements of a thriller. It’s loosely based on the notorious case of Amanda Knox, an American student who was accused of her roommate’s murder while living in Italy. Abigail Breslin (left) stars as Allison Baker and Matt Damon (right) stars as her father Bill Baker in director Tom McCarthy\'s ""Stillwater"", a Focus Features release. The film is a drama inspired by the Amanda Knox case. Credit Jessica Forde / Focus Features “Stillwater” changes the specifics a bit and moves the setting to Marseilles, France. Damon sees Bill Baker as a guy who went to work in the oilfield straight out of high school, making good money and going off track with drugs and alcohol, as sometimes happens. He got in trouble with the law and did time in jail. The name “Stillwater” is about more than a point on the map, it ties into the saying about still waters running deep and the way Bill handles himself, not giving much away. But he carries some heavy emotional baggage and has a lot going on under the surface of his stoic exterior, Damon said. Bill was an absent father and he carries a lot of guilt, blaming himself for what happened to his imprisoned daughter, played by Abigail Breslin. When he shows a flash of anger, you see a hint of the potential for violence that got him into trouble, Damon said. He focused on getting Bill’s physicality right, from the stiff, fire-retardant jeans he says change the way you walk, to the plaid shirt, facial hair and ball cap he saw so often on the guys he met. He also worked on his body, to get what he calls the “country strong” look of a guy who doesn’t have a six-pack but is strong from working hard and lifting heavy things. Damon has credited a couple of guys he met in Oklahoma with helping him get the details that make Bill believable, from his accent down to the smallest touches. Audiences in Oklahoma will be impressed with the way he nails the order at Sonic Drive-In when Bill stops to pick up dinner: Footlong cheese coney with onions, large tots and a large cherry limeade. How did he know what to get? Damon called Kenny Baker, a drilling superintendent from Marlow, and asked what his go-to order is. Damon said he spent a fair amount of time filming in Texas early in his career. So when there was a scene that called for Bill to talk about going to the theater, he thought he knew how he should say it. But there was some disagreement on the set. What did he do? He called Kenny and asked how he would say the word. Baker vindicated Damon by saying definitively that he would pronounce it “the-A-ter.” It’s those little touches that for Oklahomans will make Damon’s Bill Baker seem like a guy you might know.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:09 pm For nearly two decades, Clarke Stroud\'s home was the University of Oklahoma\'s hallways and board rooms as the school\'s vice president for student affairs and dean of students. Now he\'s a key part of Oklahoma\'s football program as director of operations. (Kyle Phillips / The Transcript) There’s a running joke about how the shoes, bow ties, blazers and other vibrant clothes on Clarke Stroud’s side of the bedroom closet far outnumber those of his wife, Robin. “And it’s actually true,” Stroud admits as a grin slides under his nose. He is sunken into a leather couch inside a lounge near Oklahoma\'s football offices, peering through dark-rimmed glasses, wearing two silver rings, dark jeans, a white shirt under an unstructured sport coat and, literally, blue suede shoes. For nearly the last two decades as OU’s vice president of student affairs and dean of students, only Stroud’s extroverted personality out-shined his wardrobe. Now, an important question emerges. How will tennis shoes and a coaching polo suit him? On July 1, Stroud’s tenure as a high-profile administrator supporting OU’s academic mission officially ended, and he began working as director of football operations for the athletic department. He moved out of his second-floor office in the student union’s southwest corner, a comfortable nook where he began reporting directly to the school president at age 32. In 18 years, he never bothered to replace the couch or desk. Now 50, he occupies a job unfamiliar to him, one that exists not in the university’s hallways and boardrooms, but on the sideline of Owen Field. He’s the new guy for the first time in nearly two decades, without a massive staff to instruct. Instead he’ll be a cog — though a critical one — in a machine with many moving pieces. “I had a really hard job before, in terms of the kinds of demands emotionally, physically that that job put on me,” Stroud said. “But I also did it for 18 years, so I had a routine. I knew what to do, I didn’t have to think about it. Even for some of the hardest situations I knew what to do. I’m kind of having to retrain myself here. … I have to readjust and figure out where my lane is. ""I don’t really know where my lane is, yet.” Operations directors feed their head coach’s management objectives into every program facet, from coordinating travel to communicating with strength coaches; sports medicine doctors; video and equipment staffers; people who mow the field and secretaries who push the paper. “I gotta figure out something just as small as buses,” Stroud says 12 days into his new job, racking his brain about which vendor OU uses for this. “I gotta get buses for the first home game, from the hotel where the players stay to the stadium. I haven’t done that yet.” Stroud possesses no significant athletic background. He was born in Denver, where fly fishing and snow skiing pinched his heart. He came to OU in the mid-1980s, serving briefly on the spirit squad as a RUF/NEK — he was painting “Beat the Hell Out of Texas” on the street when he first saw Robin, with whom he now shares two children after 26 years of marriage. After earning his undergraduate degree he traveled some before returning to OU, but as a graduate student bound for a quick rise in academic administration. Higher-education deans earn a gruff reputation in Hollywood’s raunchy collegiate comedies — Dean Pritchard (“Old School”), Dean Wormer (“Animal House”), Dean Van Horne (“Accepted”), etc. — but Stroud was usually more star than villain. He was a colorful face for the university. So why change gears now? His new job’s annual base salary is $155,000, which equates to a $63,250 pay cut. “This is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Stroud said. “This job doesn’t come around maybe ever again. To get an opportunity to be part of [OU coach Lincoln Riley’s] staff was just something I couldn’t pass up.” Both Stroud and new OU president James Gallogly say this was a voluntary move on Stroud’s part, not a de facto demotion resulting from the university’s presidential transfer of power. Some vice presidents were removed during the process, but Stroud says he and Gallogly got along. What’s driving this shift, Stroud implies, is similar to why he left the majesty of Colorado after high school and drifted to Oklahoma for college, then to Europe for more study, then Chicago, then back to Oklahoma. He sought a new landscape. But Stroud also expressed some level of burnout from his VP job in conversations with close friend and predecessor Matt McMillen, who was former OU coach Bob Stoops’ director of operations for 18 seasons and Riley’s for one before moving on earlier this summer. McMillen and Stroud share an open-door policy at their backyards and dinner tables. They live nine houses apart from each other on Norman’s west side. “We talked a lot with each other about whether or not it would be a fit,” McMillen said, noting the idea was even volleyed to Stoops for his opinion. Among his duties as dean of students, Stroud managed every non-academic related student service on OU’s three campuses. He sat on the threat committee, which processed any threat toward the university; such information was delivered to him directly. It wasn’t unusual if Stroud’s cell phone vibrated at 2:30 a.m. with a major concern. When the job’s pressures became especially heavy, he took sanctuary in Gaylord Family-Oklahoma Memorial Stadium, making the short walk from his office to observe a scrimmage and shake hands, laugh and talk with the Sooners until his head cleared. Stroud was a familiar face, but he still surprised Riley by approaching him about McMillen’s vacated position. “My jaw dropped at first,” Riley said. “I honestly didn’t know what to think, because [Stroud] didn’t even begin to cross my mind. But the more I thought about it I started thinking about the job and what it entails and what I would want it to be like, and he’s perfect for it. He has every skill I would want.” Most people in Riley’s candidate pool were from the athletic realm. A few weren’t, he said, and they were even further removed from it than Stroud. But background is somewhat inconsequential in this case. McMillen was a fundraiser and general off-field whiz for Kansas State athletics when he met Stoops, then he steered marketing initiatives for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association before coming to OU. At West Virginia, head coach Dana Holgorsen’s right-hand man is Alex Hammond, a former NCAA lawyer with three years’ experience in the White House. “I’ve always said I want to hire operations people that don’t want to be coaches. I don’t want to get into that world,” Holgorsen said. “Nerdy smart guys do a wonderful job as off-field administrators.” Stroud might not endorse the nerdy part, but Holgorsen’s main point hits the mark. The job lends itself to outside-the-box hires, which is why coaches and players shouldn’t be surprised if Stroud throws on a bow tie and starts speaking French around the Barry Switzer Center. (Stroud uses the language eloquently, describing OU defensive coordinator Mike Stoops’ subtle fashion sense as “je ne sais quoi,” or translated, an indefinable quality that makes something distinctive or attractive. Also, Stroud is aware of his own “panache,” a mid-16th century French term meaning flamboyant confidence of style or manner.) “I’m not gonna go hire a librarian to be an offensive line coach,” Riley said. “I’m not gonna go hire the dean of students to coach running backs. But this job is so different, because it’s very personal.” Which is another important box Stroud checks. Three years ago when traveling to an OU golf fundraiser in Palm Springs, California, Stroud and Riley met for the first time and became quick friends. Stroud was being his usual self, a standup comic posing as school dean. He immediately gave Riley the nickname “Hot Rod” and still calls him this today. “There’s Hot Rod’s car,” Stroud said following an interview with The Transcript as he passed Riley’s black SUV. The moniker is derived from the final 15 lyrics of Charley Ryan’s 1955 rockabilly hit “Hot Rod Lincoln.” You’re gonna drive me to drinkin’ if you don’t stop drivin’ that Hot Rod Lincoln. “I think I broke the mold,” Stroud said, “in terms of his expectations of a dean of students.” Riley smiles about this now, because love or hate it, the name has stuck. And since becoming “Hot Rod,” he has learned to trust and adore Stroud. Riley’s schedule offers few vacation opportunities, but Stroud has been accompanying him and others in a small circle during an annual late-summer fishing trip in Mexico.

Chance of rain 40%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:51 pm Associate Editor HENNESSEY, Okla. — When videographer Jack Quirk moved to Hennessey in 1980, he had no idea that 40 years later he’d still be there, so rooted into the community. “It’s been a lot of fun,” he said in a recent interview, in which he was on the other side of camera. Quirk was born into the news media industry and has himself worked in the field for more than four decades — his father, John, was a NBC news photographer who covered three presidencies and took the famous shot of John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting his father’s casket. The Rhode Island native came to northwest Oklahoma upon a friend’s invitation and landed the position of Enid bureau chief for Oklahoma City’s KOCO Channel 5 TV station. Based from the 13th floor of Enid’s Broadway Tower, he chased down stories and storms. It was then, nearly 38 years ago, Quirk founded KJ Filmworks, formerly known as KJ Productions, which has led to partnerships and networking with people all over the world. But local community is what he enjoys the most. “Hennessey is my Mayberry,” Quirk said. His small town of 2,500 is what drives him to want to do more. That’s how All About Hennessey (AAH) was born. “All About Hennessey started with a rodeo that got rained out,” Quirk said. At the time, there was no way to get the information out quickly. The local newspaper was only a weekly and had no social media channel. “I started a Facebook page and got 20 follows that first week,” he said. Within a month, he had 500 followers on his All About Hennessey page. That was August 2017. Today that same Facebook page is nearing 8,000 followers. “There was a true need for real-time news,” Quirk commented. Within a year, All About Hennessey evolved, spawning a website and a newspaper, too. They average 250,000 hits every month across the All About Hennessey network, which also includes a YouTube channel. “We are a micro news agency helping people know what’s going on,” Quirk said, adding AAH has become more than the local news source, it serves as the town’s tourism and visitors’ bureau too. “It’s turned into helping Hennessey stay relevant,” Quirk said. “Not to mention, there’s always a need for good news.” AAH initially provided a digital newsletter, which became a full-fledged digital newspaper with limited printed editions for people who don’t have Internet access. The digital newspaper is full color and highly interactive with links. It also can become a PDF so people can print it for their scrapbooks, Quirk said. There are now more than 1,000 subscribers to the AAH newspaper. According to Quirk, the main feature of the All About Hennessey website is it consolidated the nine calendars of Hennessey, including the school, town council, senior citizen center and the public library calendars. Any organization or group that wants to be included can easily be incorporated thanks to the magic of KJ Filmworks’ webmaster and coder Angie Bruner, Quirk said. Ads keep the AAH website afloat, thanks to what he calls “sponsor-partners.” He said local businesses and the town council are eager to support the grassroots effort to keep the community apprised of town happenings. Prior to All About Hennessey’s appearance, the town’s residents were not informed in real time about things such as water line breaks or water being shut off. Everyone would call Town Hall and “blow up their phones.” Now with AAH’s existence, town employees are proactive in contacting All About Hennessey to post notices online beforehand or the instant a break happens, thus keeping residents informed. “A day never goes by that we don’t get a ‘thank you’ or ‘how amazing’ All About Hennessey is,” Quirk said. “That’s what keeps us going.” Perhaps a unique aspect — and advantage — to All About Hennessey is Quirk’s videography background. “KJ Filmworks has allowed us to offer videos and photography most (social media) pages are not capable of,” he said, adding AAH can show people news through video. A recent example was when the Dover-Crescent blacktop washed out; other news agencies wouldn’t have covered that like AAH did, but Quirk felt it was important for the locals to actually see the road was out. AAH also features the “All About Hennessey Show.” Quirk calls it a variety show; the weekly video has news of the week, school news and a special guest who is interviewed. Quirk uses KJ Filmworks to subtly promote small-town America, too. He often will film local non-descript locations and submit it as stock footage for TV shows and movies. His footage has been repeatedly used in transition shots in Hallmark movies. Hennessey’s main street actually made an appearance in the second season of the “Big Bang Theory” spinoff “Young Sheldon.” The popularity of All About Hennessey has spread to other communities who’ve expressed the desire to have their own version, so Quirk created the All About Network to support his micro news model. He’s already developed All About Kingfisher, All About Stillwater and All About Okeene Facebook pages, and additional ones for Seiling and Edmond are in the works. Kingfisher and Stillwater recently got their own websites launched, too. “It’s a really good franchise,” he said. The All About Network follows journalism ethics, as Quirk is a member of Society of Professional Journalists and National Press Photographers Association. What’s most validating to Quirk is Oklahoma news stations follow AAH and reach out to him frequently to use his stories and videos. He’s been affiliated with NBC, ABC, CBS and FOX. He regularly partners with other state and national news agencies and outlets as well. His work has appeared on CNN, The Weather Channel, Discovery and The History Channel, to name a few. Quirk credits his KJ Filmworks staff as being the real heroes of All About Network: He has four employees working for him, including his “rock star” executive producer Renee Settlemires. “What makes it work are the teeny tiny things the town cares about.

That’s according to the latest release of data from the 2020 U.S. Census. Blackwell’s population dropped from 7,092 in 2010 to 6,058 in 2020 – a decrease of roughly 15%. The city’s population decline mirrors that of other rural cities across the state, and it decreased at twice the rate the U.S. Census Bureau predicted it would. The bureau estimated Blackwell would have a population of 6,562 in 2019, a 7.5% decline from 2010, according to its periodic population estimates. Those results, however, are unofficial. The number of occupied housing units in Blackwell dropped from 2,840 in 2010 to 2,532 in 2020. The number of vacant units increased from 558 in 2010 to 686 in 2020. Blackwell isn’t alone with a population decline. Every city and town in the Kay County has lost residents in the last decade. Ponca City had a population of 24,424 in 2020, a decrease from 25,387 in 2010. Tonkawa had a population of 3,015 in 2020, down from 3,216 in 2010. Newkirk had a population of 2,172 in 2020, a drop from 2,317 in 2010. Kaw City had a population of 325 in 2020, down from 375 in 2010. Braman had a population of 160 in 2020, down from 217 in 2010. Kay County’s population dropped by roughly 6.1% in the last decade. The county lost more than 2,800 residents from 2010 to 2020, according to Census data released in August. The county’s population now stands at roughly 43,700, compared to 46,562 in 2010. Kay County’s population drop is part of a nationwide trend among rural counties, many of which are shrinking as an increasing number of Americans move away from rural areas and toward metropolitan areas. “Many counties within metro areas saw growth, especially those in the south and west. However, as we’ve been seeing in our annual population estimates, our nation is growing slower than it used to,” said Marc Perry, a senior demographer at the Census Bureau. “This decline is evident at the local level where around 52% of the counties in the United States saw their 2020 Census populations decrease from their 2010 Census populations.” Other counties in north-central Oklahoma had similar population declines. To the west of Kay County, Grant County’s population dropped from 4,527 in 2010 to 4,169 in 2020, a roughly 7.9% drop. To the south, Noble County’s population dropped from 11,561 in 2010 to 10,924 in 2020, a roughly 5.5% drop. To the east, Osage County’s population decreased by roughly 3.5% from 47,472 in 2010 to 45,818 in 2020. While Oklahoma’s population grew, that growth largely occurred in metropolitan areas such as Tulsa and Oklahoma City. The state gained about 208,000 new residents in the last 10 years, a 5.5% increase. With more than 3.9 million residents, Oklahoma has the 28th largest population of all U.S states and the District of Columbia. About 86% of the nation’s population lived in metropolitan areas during 2020, a 1% increase from 2010. About 8% lived in micropolitan areas, which are regions that have between 10,000 and 50,000 residents. “Over the last decade, the nation grew at its slowest rate since the 1930s, a slowdown broadly reflected in local area 2020 Census population counts,” Census officials said in August. “Less than half of the nation’s 3,143 counties or equivalents gained population from 2010 to 2020, while the populations of around four-fifths of metro areas grew during the time period.” The United States has a population of more than 331 million, Census data shows. That’s an increase of more than 22 million people, or 7.4%, since 2010. California has the largest population of all U.S. states and the District of Columbia with more than 39.5 million residents. Texas has the second-largest population with more than 29 million residents, and Florida has the third largest with roughly 21.5 million. Census data is used in redistricting processes for legislative seats across the nation, both at the state and federal level. But because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Census didn’t release detailed data to lawmakers on time, officials said. In Oklahoma, state lawmakers used Census population estimates to redraw districts during their regular legislative session this spring. Those plans were passed with bipartisan support and signed into law by Gov. Kevin Stitt. Lawmakers are expected to conduct a special legislative session this fall to redraw federal congressional districts. The new districts will be used during elections starting in 2022.

Chance of rain 40%. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 11:51 pm Davyon Johnson MUSKOGEE, Okla. — Muskogee sixth-grader Davyon Johnson used some valuable life skills during his life skills class last Thursday. Davyon, who attends the 6th and 7th Grade Academy, used an abdominal thrust on a school mate who was choking on a bottle cap. Later that day, Davyon rescued a woman from a burning house. Representatives of Muskogee Police Department, Muskogee County Sheriff’s Office and Muskogee Public Schools honored the young hero Tuesday night at the Muskogee Board of Education meeting. Davyon was named an honorary member of the police and sheriff’s departments, according to an MPS Facebook post. “I felt good, excited,” Davyon said about the honor. Principal Latricia Dawkins called Davyon a “dual hero.” “He has always indicated that he wants to be an EMT,” Dawkins said. “So he got to put that desire into action and immediately saved that young man.” She said the recognition couldn’t have happened to a better person. “He is just a kind soul and well-liked by his peers and staff alike,” she said. Dawkins recalled the Thursday incident that earned Davyon the honor. She said a student was trying to fill his water bottle and trying to loosen the cap with his mouth. The cap slipped into his throat, she said. The choking student stumbled into a nearby classroom, where Davyon happened to be, she said. “Davyon immediately sprinted over and did the Heimlich maneuver,” Dawkins said. “From the account of the witnesses, when he did it the bottle cap popped out.” Davyon demonstrated how he got behind the choking student, wrapped his arms around the student and “burped him, kind of.” Davyon saved a woman from her burning house later that day. “It was a disabled lady and she was walking out of her house,” Davyon said. “She was on her porch. But I thought, being a good citizen, I would cross and help her get into her truck and leave.” He said the back of the house was on fire, “but it eventually got to the front of the house.” Davyon said he learned to do the thrust, commonly called the Heimlich maneuver, on YouTube. He said it is a valuable procedure to learn. “Just in case you’re in the situation I was in, you can know what to do,” he said. Davyon’s mother, LaToya Johnson, said she’s not surprised he behaved the way he did. She said her brother, Wendell Johnson, is an emergency medical technician. “I’m just a proud mom,” she said.
