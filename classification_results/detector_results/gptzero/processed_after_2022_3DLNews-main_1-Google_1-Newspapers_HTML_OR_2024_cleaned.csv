Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:04 am Cottage Grove Police are searching for a gunman and driver that left the scene of a shooting at Harvey Road and Gateway Blvd. at 6:05 p.m. on Jan. 31. According to Chief Cory Chase, police arrived to find 22-year-old Jacob N. Roberson of Cottage Grove had been shot at least once. He was transported to the local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. “The information we have is that the shooter and several accomplices fled the scene in what is described as a white or tan domestic sedan prior to police arriving,” Chase said. The preliminary investigation revealed a group of people were involved in a physical fight related to an on-going dispute. During the fight, the suspect fired several shots at the victim, striking Roberson at least once. “We don’t have any additional information about the dispute right now,” Chase said. “It’s still early in the investigation.” Roberson is expected to recover from his injuries. According to the report, the Cottage Grove Police Department is operating on the idea this is an isolated incident between two individuals known to each other and there is no immediate threat to public safety at this time. Cottage Grove Police Officers were assisted by Deputies with the Lane County Sheriff’s Office. Anyone with additional information about this incident should contact the Cottage Grove Police Department at (541) 942-9145. View our 5/29/24 E-Edition here! Log In 1. Be Civil.

I\'m not saying that Portland Fire & Rescue, which is headed by Commissioner Rene Gonzalez, doesn\'t do important work. I want our firefighters to have their big red trucks, hoses, poles, Dalmatians, etc. But Portland Street Response is important, too! Supporters of the alternative response program have long called on Gonzalez to more fully back PSR, and this latest development only makes that request more dire.

Democrat Tom Suozzi won yesterday\'s special election for a New York U.S. House spot, taking over the vacant seat left by Grifter in Chief George Santos when he was ousted at the end of last year. Suozzi does not really seem like a progressive icon, but it\'s sort of a numbers game at this point, and his win is sure to upset Republicans. •.After Israel\'s military bombardment of Rafah, a city in the southern part of the Gaza Strip where Palestinians had been told to relocate for their safety, the South African government has made an ""urgent request"" with the United Nation\'s International Court of Justice. South Africa is asking the court to consider if the attacks on Rafah, a geographically small city currently hosting 1.4 million Palestinians seeking shelter, violate the U.N.\'s Genocide Convention and the court\'s preliminary orders in a case accusing Israel of genocide. Meanwhile, while some sources report progress in truce talks between Israel and Hamas, more than a million people in Rafah are fearing for their lives with little option of escape. And although President Joe Biden has privately criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he— and many members of the Democratic Party— are moving forward with a massive aid package for Israel. • It\'s been a big few weeks for Sesame Street news. After Elmo caused a national existential crisis when he asked his Twitter followers how they were doing a couple weeks ago, his pal Grover is now the subject of attention. Grover, who you might know as the blue muppet, took to social media on Monday announcing he was a reporter and could say with fact-checked certainty that all his online followers are special and amazing. The journalist community, understandably prone to career pessimism, reacted to this news by warning him that in this media economy, he better not rest on his laurels. NPR turned Grover\'s post into a truly hard-hitting piece of reporting about the state of the news industry, and if nothing else, you need to read the headline: ""Grover the Muppet says he\'s a reporter. Not for long, joke his beleaguered peers."" Damn. • Finally...HAPPY VALENTINE\'S DAY! I love all of you. Here\'s some otters on a date to celebrate. 💋 XOXO XOXO XOXO 💋 A post shared by Perth Zoo (@perthzoo) Taylor Griggs is Portland Mercury\'s news reporter.

Please give us a call at 541-889-5387 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy ONTARIO — After leading the Oregon Small Business Development Center on the Treasure Valley Community College campus for 23 (and a half) years, Andrea Testi has decided the time is right to hand over her duties as director to the next generation. In a phone interview on Friday, she explained to the Argus that now is the time to bring in new blood with the know-how to use modern technology to further entrepreneurship in the modern age. “Wanting to retire and spend more time with my husband and have some new, innovative, fresh blood take over and move this to the next level” all have a hand in choosing to retire now, Testi said. “That’s what the world is based on, right?” Among her accomplishments, Testi was the first recipient of the Oregon Third Pioneer Award in 2023. She has also received a Cutler Award and an Oregon State Star — both highly regarded within the Oregon SBDC Network, according to a news release by Oregon Rep. David Gomberg, D-District 10, as obtained by the newspaper on Friday. “As one of Oregon’s longest standing SBDC directors, having primarily supported rural small business owners in Eastern Oregon, she additionally supported a number of statewide initiatives including our network’s initial advanced market research efforts statewide,” he wrote of Testi. “Her long-standing membership with the Oregon SBDC Network State Advisor Council extend support for other statewide services. As the department head in the Division of Extended Learning at Treasure Valley Community College, she additionally participated in college governance committees and supervision of this division office … Thank you, Andrea for your heartfelt efforts and career work in supporting Oregon’s small businesses.” Among her duties, Testi is responsible for management, budget, outreach, advocacy, marketing, grant writing and small business advisory services, as noted in the release. “Over the years, my role has expanded to manager of workforce training and the small business center,” she said, noting that her department is staffed by TVCC. “Both departments leverage each other’s strengths and customer base. The small business development center specifically, our mission is to provide no-cost business advising to entrepreneurs at all stages of business and help them achieve their dream, grow thrive and being successful. Testi hopes for her successor, which she wishes to see come from within the community, to continue the center’s legacy of strengthening the small business community in the Western Treasure Valley. She reminds them that a knowledge of business regulations in both Oregon and Idaho and the ability to harness modern marketing tools and trends will be crucial to executing their duties effectively. “There are a lot of changes in the small business world that have developed … People’s consumer shopping behaviors have changed, the thrust toward use of social media much more heavily other than traditional marketing has embedded itself. A new person might embrace those technologies more than I. I’m very old-fashioned traditional and [technology] just doesn’t float my boat. It is time for the younger generation or somebody more interested in the newer trends to [take over].” Understanding of business management is also vital, she adds. SBDC Office Manager Jimsie Crouch spoke highly of Testi, saying she “has touched many lives over the 23 plus years she has been here.” The college is acknowledging Testi’s contributions on Thursday, inviting the community to join the retirement party, which will be from 4 to 7 p.m. at Berts Growler Garage, 1635 S.W. Fourth Ave., Ontario. In her retirement, Testi said she and her husband plan to continue farming alfalfa on their farm — which was once home to an apple orchard. They plan, however, to eventually sell their farm and return to Wyoming, where they lived prior to her accepting the director position. Noteworthy is Testi grew up in New York and has lived in New Mexico and Utah as well. “[Plans include] go boating and fishing and horseback riding … and of all of the places, Wyoming just resonates with our hearts and that’s where we want to retire to.” The fact an article is being written about her caught Testi off guard, she admitted. “I just wanted to slip out gracefully. Leslie [Thompson, editor] is delightful, I appreciate it.” Testi’s last day on the job is Jan. 19, and she officials retires Jan. 31, she added in an email to the Argus on Friday.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:05 am Wind Energy Projects Development of wind energy projects off the southern Oregon Coast is one step closer to reality. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announced Tuesday, Feb. 12, two proposed projects, one offshore at Coos Bay, and the other off shore at Brookings, have been finalized. The BOEM said the projects support the Biden-Harris administration’s goals for deploying 30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy capacity by 2030 and 15 GW of floating offshore wind energy capacity by 2035. The WEAs were developed following extensive engagement and feedback from the state, Tribes, local residents, ocean users, federal government partners, and other members of the public. The final WEAs are based on reducing potential conflicts of ocean users, particularly on commercial fishing. But during public meetings in 2023 in Brookings and Coos Bay, locals voiced opposition and concern about the projects. One of his biggest concerns is how the construction and placement of turbines would impact the ecosystem and fishing grounds in the areas. Charleston commercial fisherman Nick Edwards said the Oregon Coast offers a great place to fish because of its abundance of species. He’s worried that could be lost to floating offshore wind. “We don’t want the demise of our ecosystem to be the unintended consequences of offshore wind,” he said. County commissioners from Coos, Curry and Douglas counties passed proclamations opposing the floating offshore wind turbines. John Sweet, one of three Coos County commissioners, said although he helped pass a county proclamation opposing the potential for floating offshore wind, he is still undecided. “I grew up right on the coast,” he said. “I worked in the ocean transportation business for almost 40 years. So I’m aware of the ocean conditions here and that gave rise to some concern that this might not work.” The two WEAs total approximately 195,012 acres and they avoid 98% of the areas recommended for exclusion due to their importance as commercial fishing grounds. The Coos Bay WEA is 61,204 acres and is located 32 miles from shore. The Brookings WEA is 133,808 acres and is about 18 miles from shore. A map of the final WEAs can be found on BOEM’s website. “BOEM values its close coordination with the State of Oregon as we continue to work together to maintain a robust and transparent offshore wind planning process,” BOEM Director Elizabeth Klein said in a release. “We will continue to work closely with Tribal governments, federal and state government agencies, ocean users, coastal communities and all interested stakeholders as we move forward with our environmental review.” On Feb. 14, 2024, BOEM will publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing its intent to prepare an environmental assessment of potential impacts from offshore wind leasing in the WEAs. The notice will initiate a 30-day public comment period. Another public comment period would occur if BOEM decides to move forward with a lease sale in either of the WEAs. In addition to engaging with the State, Tribes, coastal communities and ocean users, BOEM partnered with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) to assess opportunities for wind energy development and reduce or avoid impacts on other important ocean uses in Oregon. The agencies developed a comprehensive, ecosystem-based ocean planning model that leverages the best available data on natural resources, ocean industries like fisheries and energy production, and areas of national security activities to identify areas with high wind energy resource potential and fewer potential impacts to other ocean users and sensitive environmental resources, according to a release from BOEM. “This comprehensive approach provided valuable insights about the seascape and its uses and facilitated greater transparency and positive coordination with government partners and ocean stakeholders through direct engagement and incorporation of their feedback into the NCCOS model,” the BOEM stated. On Aug.15, 2023, BOEM announced a public comment period on two draft WEAs located offshore southern Oregon. The draft WEAs covered approximately 219,568 acres, with their closest points to land ranging from approximately 18 – 32 miles. The draft WEAs represented a subset of the original 1,159,298 acres (1,811 square miles) that the Department of the Interior identified for public comment in April 2022. Since the start of the Biden-Harris administration, the Department of the Interior has approved the nation's first six commercial-scale offshore wind energy projects. BOEM has held four offshore wind lease auctions, which have brought in almost $5.5 billion in high bids, including a record-breaking sale offshore New York and New Jersey and the first-ever sales offshore the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico coasts. BOEM officials said the agency is exploring additional opportunities for offshore wind energy development in the U.S., including in the Gulf of Maine and the U.S. Central Atlantic coast.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:10 am The Dallas High School Lady Dragons celebrate after taking first place at OSAA\'s first ever girls\' regional wrestling championships Feb. 9-10. Dallas High School has long been a powerhouse amongst the state’s elite boys’ wrestling program (they currently sit at No. 1 in state). Now that the Oregon Schools Activities Association (OSAA) finally sanctioned girls’ wrestling this year, the Dragons have wasted no time establishing their program atop the other contenders. Under the helm of first-year head coach Austin Markee, Dallas took first place at the girls’ regional wrestling championships Feb. 9-10 at McKay High School. Markee said each school is allowed to send two wrestlers per weight class to regionals. The Dragons sent 13 to compete against 214 other wrestlers representing 27 schools. Pacing Dallas were first place finishes from Polly Olliff (110 pounds) and Ivy McIntosh (115 pounds). As a team, the Dragons tallied 244 points, while host McKay took second (216.5 points) and McNary third (213). “These are the best girl wrestlers we’ve had, for sure,” Markee said. “It’s a little different with girls’ wrestling as sport (compared to the boys), emerging so fast and doubling in size each year. A few years ago, we had one girl on the team. Before that, no there was no official girls state tournament. It’s neat to watch it get as popular as fast as it has.” Up next for the girls is state championships Feb. 23-24 at Memorial Coliseum in Portland. Markee said Dallas is sending nine wrestlers to compete. He explained they had to place in the top four at regionals to qualify. “(The results) were awesome. I’m super, super happy. We had a really good day one, and a good day two,” Markee said. “I think we had it going into the finals, even though those two other teams had more wrestlers scoring points.” He added the team to beat at state will be Thurston, who qualified 11 girls. The boys’ district championships are this weekend, where the Dragons will be sending 28 wrestlers to contend, the most allowed with two per each of the 14 weight classes. Dallas High School\'s Polly Olliff takes center of the podium after placing first in the 110-pound bracket at the girls\' regional wrestling tournament. Dallas High School\'s Ivy McIntosh takes center of the podium after placing first in the 115-pound bracket at the girls\' regional wrestling tournament. The Lady Dragons who qualified at regionals to continue on to state are: First Place Polly Olliff (110) Ivy McIntosh (115) Second Place Savannah Roblin (130) Third Place Marissa McGinnis (100) Ah Pymm McDaniel (105) Jenna Rogers (145) Isabella Richey (170) Ella Byington (190) Fourth Place Sophia Devine (170) Log In Keep it Clean.

Year celebration on February 17, from 10am-3pm, on Britt Hill. Thanks to Jeresa Hren’s team at the Southern Oregon Chinese Cultural Association (SOCCA), Britt Festivals, and some generous sponsors, (including the Review), Lunar New Year is a refresh of the long-running Chinese New Year celebration—now with added Asian cultural aspects. As Peggy Dover tells us in her cover feature on page 5, this is the year of the wood dragon—welcoming strength, power, and success—something one can always use. The Britt venue will play host to demonstrations, programs and booths representing different countries—complete with dragons, dancing and so much more! Mark your calendar and join your neighbors on the hill for this cherished, and now refreshed, Jacksonville event. In addition to the Lunar New Year, Jacksonville is always celebrating its art, wine, music, and culinary scenes—not to mention being one of the best places in the region for walking, hiking, shopping, and history enthusiasts. In the 18 years I have been publisher, the Review has showcased what to do in our magical village—and during that time your support and feedback has shaped this publication from a “newspaper” into a hybrid “magazine.” Over the years it’s grown to become a beloved reflection of what it’s like to live here and be a part of small-town life. Of course, none of this is possible without the generosity of our advertising clients, all of whom need your support year-round and not just during the holidays—we would not be here without them! Not only am I fortunate to live and work here—I’m also fortunate to have two talented co-workers who make me look good! Our Managing Editor, Andrea Yancey, is always improving the appearance and readability of the Review by implementing her clever ideas. For 14 years, she’s crafted eye-pleasing issues that garner accolades and praise! And now with Belita Palu-ay, Associate Editor, on-board—our social media presence is one of the most creative and relevant in the region. Check-out her new, monthly feature, belita’s space on page 4 and “like” our Facebook and Instagram pages for a daily, digital dose of what’s going on in town.

of union bargaining in Oregon have shined a spotlight onto issues educators deal with in their day-to-day lives. For over three weeks in November 2023, Portland Public Schools teachers embarked on an unprecedented strike in an effort to come to an agreement with the PPS district. On Nov. 26, the district and the union representing teachers, counselors and other school employees reached a tentative deal. The three-year, $175 million contract agreement included cost-of-living increases for teachers, the creation of new committees to govern class sizes and increased planning time for educators, according to reporting from Oregon Public Broadcasting. Meanwhile, local teachers were fighting for a new contract all the while. Bend-La Pine Schools and the Bend Education Association, the teacher\'s union for BLPS, reached a tentative contract agreement on Jan. 30 after bargaining since May 30, 2023. BLPS certified staff had been working without a contract since it expired on June 30. The contract was ratified by union members on Saturday, Feb. 10. The school board was slated to vote on the contract on Feb. 13. ""I think the agreement is solid,"" said BEA president Sarah Barclay. ""I believe it takes into account many priorities that members had brought forward."" According to Barclay, the agreement made major improvements to more than 20 articles, which was nearly the entire contract. ""This agreement is the result of lengthy and deep discussions with certified employees in our district on issues that matter both to them and to us,"" said Superintendent Steve Cook in a press release. While a contract has been ratified, the job of being a teacher is not easy, and is constantly growing and changing. Over the years, the duties, responsibilities and class sizes have grown exponentially, making it so that teachers today are tasked with being so much more than just classroom teachers. More work, coupled with fewer resources, has caused a major strain on educators trying their hardest to do the critical jobs they are passionate about. For their new contract, educators asked for a fair cost of living adjustment, manageable class sizes and workloads, and safety and behavior protocols. One item requested in the BLPS contract was more planning time. While most people are aware of the hard work teachers put into lessons and the time it takes to grade each student\'s work, most don\'t realize the amount of time and energy educators are putting in outside of work hours, without getting paid. Outside of work ""The education system is built upon free labor,"" said a BLPS teacher who chose not to be named out of fear of retaliation. Teachers are often forced to work outside of work hours to do their jobs effectively. On top of the time it takes to plan engaging lessons and assess students\' work, teachers also have to communicate with families and students, clean and organize their spaces, acquire supplies, enter behavioral data, serve on school improvement committees, and more. According to that unnamed teacher, the list of extra duties far exceeds the prep time teachers are provided. ""Teaching is no longer just teaching students about the curriculum,"" said BLPS teacher Heather Faast. Teaching, for her, has changed drastically in the last 20 years, with growing responsibilities and duties. The pace of the daily teaching schedule makes it nearly impossible for teachers to get extra work done during contract hours. ""The running joke is you realize you have to pee at the end of first period. Then, lunch comes around and you realize, \'oh I still haven\'t gone to the bathroom,\'"" said James Williams, a BLPS teacher. ""You\'re on from the time you walk in this building."" Faast wishes teachers had more help, and more prep time inside working hours. ""Teaching is not a \'9 to 5\' type of job,"" she said. The amount of work teachers are doing at home has been exacerbated by increasingly large class sizes. Ruth Fox has been a middle school teacher in Bend for 16 years. Over the years, she\'s witnessed how the growing class sizes have drastically changed the pace and the amount of work that teachers must do. ""Over those years, the trend for what is being asked of us has been to do more with less,"" she said. The class size cap for schools used to hover around 25 students per class, said Fox. Today, teachers have 30 to 35 students in each class. Most of Williams\' classes contain over 30 students. He strives to give them thoughtful and personalized feedback, he said, which can take him up to 10-12 extra hours per week outside of the classroom for just one assignment. ""It\'s hard not to feel like it\'s an insurmountable task, because of the sheer number of students that they pile into your class and the responsibilities that are ever growing,"" he said. With more resources and funding, teachers could have smaller class sizes, helping students get the attention, feedback and care they need to learn. The difference between a class of 23 versus 33, Williams said, makes a huge difference. Class size is not addressed in the contract, said Barclay. ""We want to do a good job; that\'s why it\'s so frustrating,"" said Williams. ""We feel like we often can\'t. We know we can do a better job for the students."" Classroom changes Since the pandemic, teachers have noticed a change in classrooms, seeing kids with behavior problems struggling to focus. ""As educators, we have to meet our kids where they are at, and that changes from year to year,"" said an anonymous BLPS teacher. Some students, she said, are checked out and avoiding classwork; some are causing major disruptions and others are struggling to focus and learn because of other kids around them. According to Fox, students are also struggling with mental health issues in higher numbers. Many often try to blame these increasing behaviors on the pandemic, but Fox sees it as more of a systemic issue. Teachers know the importance of students\' mental health, but they often don\'t have the capacity to provide what kids need. One teacher outside of the BLPS district, who wishes to be anonymous, has also noticed changes in recent years, seeing just how much the responsibilities have fallen on teachers. ""If you graduated any time before 2019, teachers were mostly just teachers,"" she said. Historically, every teacher has had unspoken job descriptions with extra responsibilities, she noted. However, the pandemic has only added more onto their plates. ""Those responsibilities have morphed in the past few years from unwritten job descriptions to implied, demanded, and all but required expectation,"" she said. ""Teachers now are instructors, therapists, interventionists, parent mediators, conflict managers, guardians and so much more,"" said the anonymous teacher. Teachers have been speaking up about this issue, and are hoping to be heard, according to Fox. Schools don\'t have enough mental health and behavior support staff to address these needs, so it falls on the teachers\' backs. ""This trend towards doing more with less is leading to teacher burnout,"" said Fox. The ratified contract will move forward with an article including learning environment provisions, allowing educators to make decisions about prioritizing safety and making sure that students who are dysregulated or need a different space for the time being are able to get what they need, while everyone else in the classroom is able to continue learning, according to Barclay of BEA. Retaining and gaining educators The growing duties and the pressure that goes along with them have led many teachers to a breaking point. The lack of resources, and staff, to help students struggling with issues is causing teachers to leave the field. The amount of turnover Fox has seen in recent years, she said, is staggering. Williams has seen his school lose a number of great teachers in recent years, too. ""Teachers I really looked up to and were really damn good at their jobs...they finally said, \'I can\'t do this anymore.\' That, I think, is very telling,"" Williams said. He worries about the next generation of teachers and how they will fare with the current system. The trend of losing teachers is not new today. Schools all around the country are suffering with the loss of great teachers. A 2022 survey, conducted by the National Education Association, found that 55% of educators said they were thinking about leaving the profession. ""We need funding to be able to recruit and to retain teachers, and we need a robust system of mentors that are given the time and space to help new teachers,"" said Fox. Most teachers would agree that funding is at the root of a lot of major problems in the field. ""We need more money. Yes, from the district, but they need more money from the state,"" Williams said. ""If we zoom out further, America as a country needs to get to a place where it takes education more seriously."" After the Portland Public Schools strike ended in late November, Gov. Tina Kotek said she'}]"

Measure 110, a drug treatment and recovery act, aims to connect drug users to treatment and recovery services, including housing assistance instead of serving time in jail for possessing small amounts of drugs. Kristyna Wentz-Graff / OPB Oregon lawmakers are considering introducing a bill to make possession of small amounts of drugs a low-level crime in the state, a move that would weaken a major piece of 2020′s Ballot Measure 110.

It includes items defined by the National Trails System Act for consistent administration of the trail across local, state, federal, and tribal lands to ensure managers develop the trail and preserve its natural beauty. “With the comprehensive plan in place, new trail locations can be studied, and new trail segments will be constructed as conditions allow,” said Liz Berger, Acting Regional Forester for the Pacific Northwest Region of the Forest Service. “This will enable the trail to evolve and adapt to changing needs and environmental considerations, ensuring its sustainability for future generations.” The development of the comprehensive plan involved a collaborative process that included input from a wide range of stakeholders, such as trail users, local communities, conservation groups and the Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail Advisory Council. The Forest Service gathered public input on the plan and environmental analysis during a scoping comment period from September 29 to November 14, 2022, a draft comprehensive plan and environmental assessment public comment period from March 17 to April 17, 2023, and objection resolution meeting in October 2023. The public\'s input was instrumental in shaping the final comprehensive plan, ensuring that it reflects the needs and aspirations of various stakeholders. ""This comprehensive plan is the result of a collective effort that involved input from a wide range of stakeholders,"" said Sally Butts, Director, Recreation, Lands, and Minerals for the Pacific Northwest Region of the Forest Service. ""We are committed to protecting and managing the Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail and are confident that the plan will provide a roadmap for the trail\'s management, protection, and use for years to come."" The plan is not only a blueprint for the trail\'s completion, but also a tool for conservation across the region. It will provide new protections for the landscape and support shared stewardship, ensuring that the trail experience it provides will receive proper protections. The plan will define the future vision for administration and management of the trail, ensuring consistent management and protection from one end to the other. The completion of the Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail Comprehensive Plan is a testament to the dedication and collaborative effort of all stakeholders involved in its development. It represents a critical step forward in the preservation and responsible management of this trail, which holds immense value for both recreational opportunities and conservation efforts across the region. The Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail is a 1,200-mile hiking trail that starts in Glacier National Park in Montana, crosses through northern Idaho, and finishes in Olympic National Park in Washington. It was designated by Congress as part of the National Trails System in 2009. The trail provides opportunities for long-distance, non-motorized recreation with portions of the trail located in remote areas that require bushwhacking with no trail.

Rainfall possibly over one inch. Locally heavy rainfall possible. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:19 am Pyrosoma atlanticum is the most observed species found along Oregon beaches are a rigid, bumpy, pinkish-gray tube about the size of a finger. Throughout the world pyrosomes can range in size from a few centimeters to over 30 feet long, but the common Pyrosoma atlanticum reaches a maximum length of two feet. These totally tubular critters are actually known as a colonial tunicate, a mass of thousands of smaller organisms with a rigid notochord (a simplistic backbone). Pyrosomes are actually colonies of multi-celled animals called zooids. Thousands of cloned zooids create the cylinder-shaped, tube-like body and are connected by tissue that enable communication and coordinated behavior. To swim and feed, pyrosomes move their cilia (hair-like structures) together to draw in water and filter-feed on plankton. After the plankton is caught on mucus the zooids expel the water in coordination to propel their tube-body through the sea. Similar to other pelagic creatures (animals that live in the open ocean) pyrosomes migrate vertically and are capable of swimming a vertical distance of 2500 feet in one day. Their scientific name pyrosoma roughly translates into a Greek word for “firebody” which references their ability to exhibit bioluminescence while alive. In general, the life cycle and role of the pyrosome in the ocean food web remains a mystery, but some scientists have theorized that the bioluminescence is to attract plankton to eat. Likewise, other observations have been made that pyrosomes seem to be successful when ocean conditions promote plankton blooms. Known predators include bony fish, dolphins and whales. While it is generally understood that pyrosomes do not pose a threat to humans, local experts suggest not letting pets eat pyrosomes when found on the beach! Log In 1. Be Civil.

we knew it was turned upside down by the COVID-19 pandemic. People were working from home or not at all, and schools faced the challenging task of implementing remote learning. Some districts were more successful than others, but American students as a whole found themselves educationally behind once schools opened back up again. Now that more time has passed and students are starting to recover, the impacts of educational disparities are becoming apparent. On the evening of Feb. 13, the George Fox University (GFU) Center for Peace & Justice hosted its annual Woolman Peacemaking Forum. This year, the featured speaker was Jonathan Kuttab, a Palestinian Christian based in East Jerusalem. The event was attended by GFU students, faculty, and community members from the Newberg area. On Dec. 31, the United Kingdom officially put into effect the new legislative ban on XL bully breeds. Due to the over 300 vicious dog attacks in 2023 that have become all too frequent throughout the UK, all countries except Northern Ireland have implemented this ban. Bully breeds, such as pitbulls, bull mastiffs, bulldogs, boxers, great danes, and rottweilers will need to be muzzled at all times outside of their home and kept harnessed and leashed. We all know former president Donald Trump is on trial for something, but the details tend to be a bit hazy. He is currently facing many different charges in different states for different crimes, as well as looking at both civil and criminal penalties. Yet even with these pending charges and penalties, he’s still running for president and winning in Republican polls. So what exactly is happening with the Trump trial(s)? Nothing strikes quite as much fear in the heart of a college student as the words “student loan debt.” In the last few decades, the amount of debt required to receive an education has reached crisis levels, with the average student borrowing $32,637 to obtain a bachelor’s degree, and 54% of college graduates leaving school with debt. When Joe Biden became president, chief among his campaign promises was a plan for student loan forgiveness. As of October, the COVID-era pause on student loan repayment has ended, and there’s quite a bit of uncertainty about what borrowers can actually expect from the Biden administration. In the spring 2022, George Fox University (GFU) announced its newest construction project in a series of campus improvement projects. The largest undertaking was the construction of a new chapel which did not begin until summer 2023. According to Shawn Daley, chief strategy and business development officer for the Office of the President, the chapel is set to be complete and fully operational by October 2024. George Fox University’s (GFU) homecoming weekend was filled with celebration, nostalgia, and the hope of a successful Bruin football game. Unfortunately, the game took a turn for the worse in the fourth quarter, with the Bruins losing to the Lewis and Clark Pioneers by six points in overtime. As spring sports begin at George Fox University (GFU), the reigning Northwest Conference championship-winning track and field team is off to a great start in their early meets. This hot start seems to indicate a very successful indoor season, which saw several record-breaking performances and several athletes competing at the national championships. On Jan. 12, 2023, the Religious Exemption Accountability Project (REAP) announced its case against the US Department of Education had been dismissed by the US District Court of Oregon. The announcement was made via REAP’s Instagram account on Jan. 13, 2023. It took five days and 15 ballots for the House of Representatives to finally elect the Speaker of the House for the 118th U.S. Congress. The grim path to victory for Representative Kevin McCarthy of California revealed the deep-rooted dysfunction of Congress and the upcoming term’s potential challenges. But, what does any of this mean, and how did we get here? Listed next to laundry supplies, linens, and dorm decorations on the “What to Bring to Campus” section of the George Fox University (GFU) website, is a 72-hour emergency preparedness kit. According to the university, each student should have various survival, food, shelter, hygiene, and medical supplies that would make them mostly self-sufficient in an emergency for up to three days. George Fox University (GFU) has a long-standing tradition of hosting a film festival at both the Cameo Theatre and in Bauman Auditorium. With this year being its 26th anniversary, it is no surprise that the festival is a highlight in the Newberg community and on campus. With works from cinematic arts majors, animation majors, film production majors, and even kinesiology majors, the festival is open to all undergraduates to submit their films. On Aug. 25, 2021, I moved into the second floor of Hobson Hall and took my first steps onto George Fox University’s (GFU) campus as a new student. As a bright-eyed 18-year-old and newly out lesbian, I felt invincible. I was clueless about the state of queer acceptance and existence at GFU, but I didn’t care. I had purple hair, a new septum ring, and the courage to handle whatever would come my way. Serendipitously, I met some beautiful queer friends on my floor and fell into the LGBTQ+ community at Table 14. Along with making friends, I was learning so much in my classes and loved my major. Nothing can compare to the freshness of that first semester of college. In late January and February George Fox University (GFU) held its annual Scholarship Summit, an event for admitted incoming freshmen. Each department organizes an event for potential students and awards prizes ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 on top of merit and need-based scholarships. However, this event has significantly evolved to achieve its current state. Dr. Carlisle Chambers is easily one of the toughest chemistry professors in the Chemistry Department at George Fox University (GFU). However, there is much more behind Chambers than just a love of electronegativity and spontaneous reactions. Carena Hadi is a sophomore marketing major at George Fox University (GFU). She’s a marketing intern for UREC, a student ambassador, and involved in spiritual life. In many ways, she’s a regular GFU student and a well-connected member of the community. But Carena is also Palestinian-American, and her life has been impacted by the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Being a Christian, a Palestinian-American, and a GFU student places Carena in a unique and challenging position as she navigates campus culture. Professor Isaac Choi, director of the Honors Program and associate professor of Philosophy, is well-known around the George Fox University (GFU) campus. Students from the Honors Program, to the Theology department, to even the Biology department know who he is. Though he has his Ph.D. in philosophy, Choi’s first love as a young boy growing up in Chicago was science. This year marks George Fox’s 400th birthday. George Fox, the founder of the Religious Society of Friends, also called the Quakers, was born in 1624. Now 400 years later, George Fox University (GFU) operates a university under his name. According to Mary Peterson, George Fox University (GFU) vice president of Academic Operations, “[the academic] strategy at the university over the last ten years has been investing in [...] ‘high barrier, high demand programs.’” Since that fateful day of March 2020, George Fox University (GFU) has undergone a slew of dramatic changes. Programs and majors have been cut, demoted, and restructured. Students and faculty have been promised, then denied, new facilities. Departments have shuffled around the quad. And finally, the campus has carefully watched the construction of the new chapel. These tumultuous changes have been a mixed bag of the administration struggling to fulfill its promises and students criticizing their decisions. However, the Board of Trustees and President Robin Baker have big plans for the future of GFU. In the 2020 Presidential election, 76% of white evangelicals voted for Donald Trump.

(LONDON) - When a professional person – especially a doctor – has repeatedly been shown to be wrong in their professional judgment and, as a direct consequence, people have been harmed, that doctor should surely be held personally responsible and accountable: in such circumstances legitimate criticism should not be dismissed as an ad hominem (personal) attack. Following the award of the inaugural John Maddox Prize to psychiatrist Professor Sir Simon Wessely for his alleged “courage” in “standing up for science” and for promoting “sound science” about ME/CFS in the face of “hostility” in doing so, a letter published on 13th January 2013 by the Countess of Mar, Professor Malcolm Hooper and Dr William Weir in The Independent on Sunday was explicit that criticism of Wessely’s hypothesis about ME/CFS is scientifically legitimate: “Scientific understanding always depends upon sound evidence….For scientific understanding to prevail, the extensive biomedical evidence-base of ME/CFS must now be recognised by all researchers in the field. The idea that ME/CFS is due to a dysfunctional psyche is a hypothesis without an evidence-base. The Maddox Prize was therefore awarded to the defender of an hypothesis with no evidence-base rather than to someone who was upholding true scientific inquiry. Personal attacks against Professor Sir Simon Wessely do not advance the cause, but it is scientifically legitimate to direct criticism at the hypothesis both he and Professor White (chief Principal Investigator of the MRC’s PACE trial on ME/CFS) continue to espouse”. It has been shown time and again that Professor Sir Simon’s published assertions about disorders such as ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, Gulf War Syndrome, the Camelford drinking water poisoning, and interstitial cystitis are simply wrong. Merely stating so is likely to result in yet more claims by him of “harassment” and “attack” upon him but, in the words of Professor Martin Bland, one of the UK’s leading medical statisticians, it is important that false information should not remain on the record to be quoted uncritically by others: “Potentially incorrect conclusions, based on faulty analysis, should not be allowed to remain in the literature to be cited uncritically by others” (Fatigue and psychological distress. BMJ: 19th February 2000:320:515-516). Wessely’s “incorrect conclusions”, however, remain in the literature to be cited uncritically by others and therefore may result in iatrogenic harm. For over 25 years Wessely’s dismissal and rejection of the biomedical evidence on ME has continued unabated, even though there is substantial evidence of on-going inflammation throughout the body; systems prominently affected are the central and autonomic nervous systems, the immune system and the cardiovascular, endocrine, gastro-intestinal and musculoskeletal systems. Unscientifically, he conflates ME, CFS, PVFS and chronic “fatigue” into what he refers to as “CFS”. This has become a waste-basket label, with 40% of those afforded it subsequently being shown to have other diagnoses (J R Coll Physicians Edinb, 2010:40(4):304-307). Despite the extensive biomedical evidence that shows him to be wrong, Wessely is certain that he is right: he believes that ME/CFS is a behavioural disorder that should be managed with “cognitive restructuring” specifically designed to convince sufferers that they are not physically sick. Indeed In October 2003, in a frenzied attack on people with ME and on those scientists and clinicians who regard it as an organic disorder, Wessely raged that those who disagree with him and believe ME to be an organic disorder (to whom he referred as “the radicals”) are “crazy” and that they are “engaged in fantasies, lies and gross distortions”. He wrote that the “radicals” are left “fighting yesterday’s battles” (seemingly because he believes he has established that ME does not exist except as a false illness belief), that they need a “reality check” and that “their behaviour is outrageous” (private communication; available to Medical Defence Union lawyers on legitimate request). Ten years later, his views have not progressed in line with the advancement of medical science: at a medical meeting in March 2013 held in Bristol, Wessely informed attendees that ME has been caused almost entirely by what he called the “shockingly” negative way in which some ME charities, in particular the ME Association, portray it as a viral illness, saying that this has harmed patients as it encourages them to focus too much on symptoms and to be fearful of activity, resulting in a vicious cycle of deconditioning. Making no distinction between chronic “fatigue” and ME/CFS, doctors were assured by Wessely that all patients with CFS would benefit from the same management regime, namely behavioural therapy and exercise (Research in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome – ups and downs; Bristol Medico-Chirurgical Society; 13th March 2013: approved as a Continuing Medical Education module). The continued propagation of such erroneous beliefs is a matter of significant concern because of their potential harm to very sick people, so it may be appropriate to re-consider the evidence that proves Professor Sir Simon to be wrong about four other issues as well: fibromyalgia, Gulf War Syndrome, the Camelford poisoning tragedy, and interstitial cystitis. Fibromyalgia As with ME/CFS, Simon Wessely believes that fibromyalgia (FM) is a functional somatic disorder (Lancet 1999:354:936-939), despite the fact that FM is formally classified in the World Heath Organisation’s ICD-10 at M79 as a soft tissue disorder. FM was officially recognised as a syndrome on 1st January 1993 by the WHO as a result of the Copenhagen Declaration (Consensus Document on Fibromyalgia: The Copenhagen Declaration 1992). It is a systemic disorder and affects not only the muscles – including the heart – but also the gut and immune system, and these are all recognised features of FM. Israeli researchers have pointed out that FM is believed to be the result of a central nervous system malfunction and emphasised that: “many of the differential diagnoses can be excluded by means of an extensive clinical examination and patient history” (Autoimmun Rev 2012 Jun:11(8)585-588), but Wessely advises against extensive clinical examination, claiming that it supports patients’ false beliefs that they are physically ill.

tenant compte des besoins des utilisateurs. Au cœur des démarches d’innovation, il implique une compréhension profonde des interactions entre les fournisseurs de services et leurs clients. En utilisant des principes tels que la co-création, la prise en compte de l’expérience utilisateur (UX) et le parcours client, les designers de service cherchent à concevoir des solutions qui non seulement satisfont, mais dépassent les attentes. À l’ère du numérique, où les services sont de plus en plus immatériels et centrés sur l’expérience, maîtriser les enjeux du design de service devient fondamental pour les entreprises souhaitant rester compétitives. Plan de l'article Conception centrée utilisateur : Voilà l’axiome sur lequel se fonde le design de service. Cette approche vise à créer des services non seulement utiles, mais aussi facilement utilisables, en se plaçant résolument du point de vue de l’utilisateur. Le design de service, effectivement, est centré sur l’utilisateur, avec un impératif : répondre de manière précise et adaptée à ses besoins et attentes. Dans cette optique, les designers de service déploient un arsenal de techniques et d’outils pour sonder en profondeur les motivations et les comportements des utilisateurs, afin d’aligner les fonctionnalités du service sur les exigences réelles de son public cible. A lire en complément : L'astuce de se déplacer en taxi dans les Yvelines La transformation de la société de l’information a accru la valeur d’usage des services. Dans un monde où l’information est omniprésente et instantanément accessible, les utilisateurs recherchent des expériences qui apportent une réelle plus-value dans leur quotidien. Le design de service répond à cette quête en privilégiant la valeur d’usage sur la possession pure et simple. L’objectif est de créer des expériences riches et engageantes, qui renforcent le lien entre l’utilisateur et le service, et par extension, entre le client et la marque. Le design de service est une discipline qui transcende la simple fourniture d’une prestation pour embrasser une vision holistique de l’expérience utilisateur. Les professionnels du secteur doivent donc manier avec dextérité les outils de l’analyse comportementale, de la stratégie de service et du design interactif pour concevoir des services qui résonnent véritablement avec les attentes fonctionnelles et émotionnelles de leurs utilisateurs. Une tâche complexe, certes, mais essentielle pour toute entité aspirant à se distinguer dans la vaste arène des services modernes. A lire en complément : La méthodologie de l'enquête sociale : étapes clés et objectifs L’économie des services occupe une place prépondérante dans le tissu économique mondial. L’entreprise contemporaine, immergée dans ce contexte, ne peut ignorer le rôle déterminant du design de service pour se frayer un chemin dans un marché hautement concurrentiel. Prise dans les turbulences d’une concurrence acharnée, chaque entreprise cherche à incorporer le design de service comme vecteur de différenciation. Cette intégration va au-delà de la simple amélioration esthétique ou fonctionnelle : elle devient un élément fondamental de la stratégie globale. Le marché actuel, saturé d’offres souvent similaires, exige que les entreprises fassent preuve de créativité pour captiver l’attention et fidéliser leur clientèle. Le design de service émerge alors comme un outil stratégique permettant de concevoir des expériences inédites et personnalisées. Les entreprises qui adoptent cette approche ne se contentent plus de vendre un produit ou un service ; elles vendent une expérience globale, souvent synonyme de valeur ajoutée pour le consommateur. L’enjeu pour les entreprises est de taille : il s’agit de comprendre et anticiper les besoins et désirs de leur clientèle avec une précision accrue. Dans cette optique, le design de service permet de tisser un lien direct entre l’offre et les attentes, parfois inconscientes, des utilisateurs. L’entreprise doit alors mobiliser des ressources pour investir dans la recherche, l’innovation et le développement de services qui résonnent avec les aspirations profondes de leur marché cible. Prenez en compte la rapidité de l’évolution technologique qui influence directement l’économie des services. Le design de service doit s’adapter continuellement pour intégrer les nouvelles technologies et rester pertinent. Les entreprises qui parviennent à marier innovation technologique et excellence dans le design de service sont celles qui se démarqueront. Elles pourront offrir des solutions qui non seulement répondent aux demandes actuelles, mais ouvrent aussi la voie à de nouvelles façons de consommer les services demain. Au cœur du design de service repose le principe de la conception centrée utilisateur, qui place l’individu au premier plan de tout processus créatif. Ce fondement dicte que chaque service doit être utile et aisément utilisable, répondant ainsi à une valeur d’usage grandissante dans une société où l’information circule en continu. La transformation numérique a mis en exergue cette valeur, poussant les entreprises à se focaliser sur les attentes fonctionnelles et émotionnelles de leurs clients. Dans cette optique, le design de service se veut un pont entre les désirs des utilisateurs et les propositions de valeur des entreprises. La démarche créative et collaborative, autre pilier du design de service, implique une co-création avec les parties prenantes. Envisagez un écosystème où les utilisateurs, designers et autres acteurs s’unissent pour tisser ensemble l’expérience future. Cette synergie permet de générer des solutions innovantes qui résonnent avec les nuances complexes de la vie réelle des utilisateurs. Le design de service transcende la création de fonctionnalités pour englober une expérience globale, marquée par un passage fluide entre les services et les valeurs de possession. Les services d’aujourd’hui, pour être compétitifs, doivent s’inscrire dans une expérience passerelle où l’utilisateur transite harmonieusement d’un point de contact à un autre. Cela implique une fine compréhension des parcours utilisateurs et la capacité à anticiper leurs besoins futurs. Le design de service s’appuie sur des principes tels que le design thinking et le lean UX pour orchestrer ces transitions et rendre l’expérience utilisateur cohérente et mémorable. Le design de service est une alchimie où l’art de l’anticipation et la maîtrise de l’émotionnel se rencontrent pour créer des services à forte valeur ajoutée. Le design de service, par sa nature intrinsèquement méthodique, requiert une approche structurée pour parvenir à l’innovation. Utilisez des cadres méthodologiques tels que le design thinking et le lean UX pour favoriser l’émergence de solutions inédites. Ces méthodologies permettent de décomposer le processus de conception en phases itératives, où l’empathie pour l’utilisateur et le prototypage rapide sont des vecteurs de progrès. Considérez ces approches comme des cartes vous guidant à travers le paysage complexe des besoins et des comportements des utilisateurs, afin de révéler des opportunités souvent insoupçonnées. Le secteur public se dote progressivement du design de service pour réinventer ses interactions avec les citoyens. Le design de service public devient un outil clé pour les administrations soucieuses d’améliorer l’efficacité et l’expérience utilisateur de leurs prestations. Des études de cas illustrent comment des services publics ont été transformés par une démarche de co-création, impliquant à la fois les fonctionnaires et les citoyens dans le processus de conception. Ces expériences mettent en lumière la capacité du design de service à créer des écosystèmes de services plus intégrés et centrés sur l’humain.

The sunshine-infused music video for Mal London\'s single “Yikes,” made our list of Portland’s Best Music Videos of 2023., and we\'re excited to have another from the local artist. Shot and edited by Mal London and Dante Ammon, the visual for the smooth, bass-driven single, “Time Will Tell,” stars Portland-based celebrity hairstylist Miko Gemechu. Known in the Black beauty community for slaying natural-looking wigs, weaves, and extensions—along with other natural styles, like braids and hairstyles for male stars from Carmelo Anthony to Aminé and more—Miko is also beautiful as a model, not to mention known for being one of the sweetest people to work with, should you be blessed enough to experience one of her hair care services. She appears in “Time Will Tell,” as the love interest to Mal London; it\'s an instance of art imitating life, as the two have established themselves as a pair in real life for a while now. The song itself is rooted in sultry R&B with an infectious bass line and crisp beat providing runway for the multi-talented emcee\'s seamless singing and rapping transitions. Some upcoming music buzz to add to your radar. On February 6, the Decemberists released a new song titled “Burial Ground,” marking their first new music in more than six years, since 2018’s Traveling On. Co-produced with Tucker Martine, and featuring the Shins’ James Mercer, the jangly guitars, swelling horns, sing-song lyrics, and peace-and-love vibes of the track remind us of late’60s, early ’70s pop-rock. In a release sent to the Mercury, frontman Colin Meloy expanded on inspiration behind the song: ""\'Burial Ground\' is in that time-honored pop song tradition, a paean to hanging out in graveyards... the melody hook came to me in a dream, and I hummed it into my phone on waking."" A couple days after the release, the band announced its 2024 tour, which kicks off in April! The Peaceable Kingdom Tour will make at least two stops in Oregon—Bend on July 12 at Hayden Homes Amphitheater and the tour\'s final date (at least of this leg) on August 3 at McMenamins Edgefield in Troutdate. (The latter is my favorite summer-time outdoor venue.) Get your tickets soon before they sell out.

Chance of rain 100%. Rainfall possibly over one inch. Locally heavy rainfall possible. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:09 am Pyrosoma atlanticum is the most observed species found along Oregon beaches are a rigid, bumpy, pinkish-gray tube about the size of a finger. Throughout the world pyrosomes can range in size from a few centimeters to over 30 feet long, but the common Pyrosoma atlanticum reaches a maximum length of two feet. These totally tubular critters are actually known as a colonial tunicate, a mass of thousands of smaller organisms with a rigid notochord (a simplistic backbone). Pyrosomes are actually colonies of multi-celled animals called zooids. Thousands of cloned zooids create the cylinder-shaped, tube-like body and are connected by tissue that enable communication and coordinated behavior. To swim and feed, pyrosomes move their cilia (hair-like structures) together to draw in water and filter-feed on plankton. After the plankton is caught on mucus the zooids expel the water in coordination to propel their tube-body through the sea. Similar to other pelagic creatures (animals that live in the open ocean) pyrosomes migrate vertically and are capable of swimming a vertical distance of 2500 feet in one day. Their scientific name pyrosoma roughly translates into a Greek word for “firebody” which references their ability to exhibit bioluminescence while alive. In general, the life cycle and role of the pyrosome in the ocean food web remains a mystery, but some scientists have theorized that the bioluminescence is to attract plankton to eat. Likewise, other observations have been made that pyrosomes seem to be successful when ocean conditions promote plankton blooms. Known predators include bony fish, dolphins and whales. While it is generally understood that pyrosomes do not pose a threat to humans, local experts suggest not letting pets eat pyrosomes when found on the beach!

During a budget workshop last Tuesday, Portland Fire Chief Ryan Gillespie said Portland Fire & Rescue (PF&R) expects to overspend its roughly $175 million budget by about $11 million in the 2024-25 fiscal year, unless the city intervenes with a cash infusion. Bureau leaders say most of the budget gap is due to rising overtime costs, impending retirements, and inflation. Gillespie says if the city is serious about prioritizing improved emergency response times, it needs to cough up more money for the fire bureau. “If we received ($11 million) we would not have to make any cuts to our emergency operations,” Gillespie told Portland City Council. The city is trying to avoid a deficit in its 2024-25 budget by asking all bureaus except for public safety services to shave 5 percent from their spending plans. Chief Gillespie and other emergency management staff note about $6.2 million of the $11 million budget gap stems from funds allocated for retirees. Another $4 million comes from overtime expenses, and about $2.3 million from other personnel costs represent the largest strain on the budget. Overtime costs at the fire bureau increased in 2022, after contract negotiations led to a change in the structure of firefighters’ work hours. PF&R staff used to work 51.5 hours per week, but now 50.4 hours is considered a standard work week. That means staff are paid for overtime hours if they work more than the standard 50.4 hours. The bureau says the number of firefighters currently funded by the city isn’t enough to cover the needs, amid increased emergency calls, which has led to increased overtime payouts. A 2023 staffing sufficiency analysis suggests the city could reduce its overtime expenses by budgeting for an additional 66 firefighter positions over the next two or three years. “Due to the projected number of retirements stemming from a firefighter hiring bubble 25 years ago, PF&R does not have the option to do nothing,” Citygate Associates wrote in its memo to fire bureau leaders last June. Those anticipated retirements are now considered the biggest strain on PF&R’s budget. As first reported in the Oregonian, in an effort to fill the funding gap, PF&R is proposing slashing $3.1 million from the $10 million budget of Portland Street Response, the city’s non-police, mental health alternative response program. Portland Street Response (PSR) is housed within the fire bureau. The program, which launched in 2021, now operates citywide, but with somewhat limited staffing and hours. PSR is partially funded by city general funds, cannabis tax revenue, and American Rescue Plan Act dollars, which will soon be depleted. “The problem with fire is that there is not a lot of fat to cut outside its core mission,” Commissioner Rene Gonzalez, who currently oversees PF&R and PSR, told the publication. Fire bureau leaders gave the city three options: find $11 million for PF&R, leaving current service levels at the fire bureau and Portland Street Response intact; find $4 million for PF&R, leaving a $6 million budget gap to be addressed by slashing about $3 million each from PSR and two of the bureau’s two-person rescue apparatus; or do nothing and leave the fire bureau to cut $3 million from one of its fire stations, cut three rescue operations, and cut $3.1 million from PSR.

An audit released by the city earlier this year suggested that PSR and a similar community health program were “caught in a no-win situation” due to an overall lack of clear program guidelines or goals for success. Auditors suggested the fire bureau either find a way to expand the programs and provide the right resources, or “find the appropriate home for them.” The audit report noted Chief Gillespie was “reportedly open to sending Portland Street Response to Multnomah County or a nonprofit contractor” even though the program could qualify for Medicaid reimbursement if it expanded to 24/7 service. In response to that audit, Gillespie and Gonzalez indicated their commitment to the long-term success of PSR, but said they’re in no hurry to ramp up the program, either. “The need to ensure these programs are structurally sound, grounded in articulable, actionable goals, and financially cost-effective can no longer be ignored,” Gonzalez wrote in response to auditors last month. The proposed cuts to PSR come as the program is already struggling to cover the number of calls for help it receives. The program faced a hiring freeze last year amid budget scrutiny over purchases of essentials like tents, tarps, food and basic clothing that were distributed to unhoused people during response calls. Last summer, Gillespie told the Mercury that PSR grew too fast, too quickly. “The mission for PSR isn’t entirely clear, internally and externally,” Gillespie said shortly after being tapped to lead the fire bureau. PSR has yet to meet its initial goal of providing city-wide, round-the-clock, behavioral health support. That’s drawn ire from PSR supporters. Last year, an independent group called Friends of Portland Street Response was formed, largely as a mechanism to pressure city leaders like Gonzalez to expand funding and resources for the program. The group says Gonzalez’s office has repeatedly canceled meetings with them, and shown no interest in helping PSR serve more people in need. One option pitched to save PSR from funding cuts? A controversial handout from the Portland Clean Energy Fund. City Commissioner Carmen Rubio is proposing using money from accrued interest dividends in the PCEF program to bail out PSR. That idea has garnered disapproval from climate advocates who note PCEF was created for specific, climate-related purposes, not to be used as a bailout for failing city bureaus. It’s also led Gonzalez to suggest PCEF use more of its funds to bail out the fire bureau and pay for all the city's public safety programs. The idea has yet to be approved. The city is expected to revisit bureau budget decisions this spring, with a final budget slated to be voted on this May. Courtney Vaughn is the news editor at the Portland Mercury.

With total consumer debt reaching over $1.9 trillion in California alone and the average Californian owing nearly $81,000, developing strategic approaches to debt relief is critical for residents. This article will provide a comprehensive guide on analyzing your debt, creating customized repayment plans, utilizing financial tools, seeking professional consultation, and maintaining long-term financial health. Over 7 million Californians owe an average of $81,317 in personal debt, excluding mortgages. From credit cards to auto loans, and medical bills to student loans, debt has become ubiquitous in daily life for many state residents. However, the prevalence of debt statewide does not mean it should be normalized. High levels of debt can negatively impact financial health as well as mental and physical well-being. This underscores the importance of strategic debt relief management tailored to California’s unique circumstances. Taking a methodical, step-by-step approach tailored to your unique situation can help realistically address what may feel like insurmountable debt. The aim of exploring advanced California debt relief strategies across five key areas in this article is to provide actionable information to empower residents to take control of their debt. Armed with the right knowledge and resources on California debt relief solutions, you can formulate a strategy that works for your financial situation in California. The journey starts with understanding exactly what debts you currently owe and exploring debt relief options that make sense for your finances. Gain clarity regarding your specific debt obligations as the first step. This includes: Catalog all of this information to understand the full scope of what you owe. Use a spreadsheet or budgeting app to track details on each debt account. When analyzing debts, group them into categories based on interest rates and loan terms: Paying off high-interest debt first generally saves the most money in interest fees over time compared to low-interest, long-term debt like mortgages. However, personalized strategies based on your goals and monthly cash flow may target debts in a different order. With your complete debt picture in focus, you can develop customized repayment strategies tailored to your situation. Two common methods are the debt avalanche and debt snowball models: Larger, higher-interest debts like credit cards or personal loans work well with the debt avalanche method. However, using the debt snowball method, which prioritizes paying off the smallest dollar amounts first, can provide psychological wins and motivation to tackle larger debts. Irrespective of the approach, ensure making at least the minimum monthly payment on each debt to avoid additional fees and credit damage. Then determine how much additional you can afford to put towards the debt you’re actively focusing on above the minimums. Another potential debt relief strategy is consolidation through a personal loan or balance transfer credit card, which combines multiple debts under a single lower-interest payment. This can reduce the total interest paid over time but should be approached cautiously to avoid extending loan terms and increasing overall interest costs. Choosing the right debt relief strategy depends entirely on your specific financial situation. Focus on options offering the highest cost savings that you can realistically commit to without overburdening yourself. Joining local community financial workshops or money management peer support groups fuels the human accountability and camaraderie aspects to sustain positive momentum as we all strive towards similar money goals! The following budgeting instruments fuel success: Easy to customize across unlimited categories and metrics over any timeframe, spreadsheets empower complete birds-eye visibility of finances from a 30,000-foot view down to granular transactions. For example, a debt tracking sheet can provide a consolidated view of all debts in one place, which can be useful for understanding total debt and required monthly contributions. Updating spreadsheets consistently steers financial ships through tumultuous seas while illuminating pathways out of stormy weather. For those preferring automated, on-the-go mobile money management, flexible budgeting apps connected to bank accounts accessible centralize financial visibility for 24/7 empowerment: In conjunction with budgeting instrumentation, joining local community financial workshops or money management peer support groups fuels the human accountability and camaraderie aspects to sustain positive momentum as we all strive towards similar money goals! Additional Cash Flow Optimization Tactics Beyond budgeting, optimize cash flow through: Decrease Spending: Increase Income: Every $100 or more per month discovered improves debt payoff capacity. Financial independence awaits those who leverage information, support, and optimal tools to strategize their futures! Seeking guidance from financial professionals can provide tailored strategies not feasible on your own. These include: Can help analyze finances and provide services like Non-profit credit counseling is often free or low-cost. Reputable sources help provide unbiased guidance. Specialize in negotiating directly with creditors for options like: This enables customers to pay less than the total owed. However, fees can reach 20-25% of enrolled debt and hurt credit scores short term. Vet companies thoroughly before enrolling. DMPs are structured payment plans set up through credit counseling agencies to pay off debt. Key features include: DMPs help simplify debt payments, lower interest costs, provide account management guidance, and assist with budgeting. They aim to help motivated individuals tackle debt systematically. Bankruptcy allows those facing truly unmanageable debt the option of a fresh start. Key types include: While bankruptcies severely damage credit, they stop collections activities and provide legal protection from creditors’ lawsuits. Bankruptcy protection should be viewed as a final debt relief option due to this impact. Consult qualified legal counsel to assess if it’s the right step for your situation. Once you’ve established effective debt repayment strategies, shift focus to lifestyle changes promoting long-term financial wellness: Regularly calculating your net worth (total assets minus total liabilities) is important to see if you are making overall financial progress over time. Seeing your net worth grow month-to-month and year-to-year can help motivate continued positive financial behaviors. Set up automatic transfers from each paycheck to move 5-10% of your income into various savings and investment accounts before you have a chance to spend it. This ensures you consistently save towards retirement, emergencies, and other financial goals rather than risk overspending the money. Be very mindful of wants vs needs when making spending decisions. Create and follow a reasonable budget that allows for some fun purchases while prioritizing essential expenses and financial goals. Avoid impulse shopping sprees or buying things just because they’re on sale. If carrying credit card debt, commit to paying at least the full statement balance each month to avoid accruing additional high-interest charges, which makes the debt increasingly unmanageable over time. Revisit your budget and debt payoff strategies at least once per year to see if adjustments are needed based on changes in your income, living expenses, interest rates, retirement trajectory, or other personal situations that impact finances. Financial literacy development through reading personal finance books or taking community workshops can also equip you with skills to avoid cycles of future debt and achieve stability. The journey to lifetime financial security starts with facing debt strategically and intentionally today. Small steps done consistently lay the foundation. You can overcome debt! The first step is running the numbers – tallying all debts owed, interest rates, minimum payments due every month, and loan terms. Getting clarity on the facts sets the foundation. Then, you can determine income available to direct towards debt repayment and explore debt relief options matched to your financial situation. Those with numerous high-interest debts like credit cards will benefit most from the debt avalanche method, paying off debts from the highest interest rate to the lowest to reduce the fees paid. However, if you have many small debts, the debt snowball method allows you to build confidence in tackling larger debts as you achieve “quick wins” on smaller balances first despite their interest rates. In the short run, credit counseling agreements or bankruptcy may hurt credit scores. However, improving payment histories and lowering credit utilization will gradually help. Avoid debt settlement programs requiring you to be behind on payments, as missed or late payments severely damage credit. Be informed of the consequences debt relief options hold for your credit before enrolling. Reputable non-profit credit counseling services offer debt relief guidance for minimal fees, usually $25-50 to enroll and then $25-75 per month for debt management plans. Many also operate on sliding scale models based on your income level and ability to pay. Most credit counseling services allow unsecured debts like credit cards, medical bills, payday loans, personal loans, and other non-collateralized high-interest debt types to be consolidated into a DMP. Secured debts with collateral like auto loans and mortgages usually cannot be included. Yes, you can contact creditors directly to negotiate reduced interest rates, settlement amounts, or modified payment terms.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:05 am Members of the OSU College of Forestry have determined that fires in Oregon were much more common than once thought. Forests on the west slope of Oregon’s Cascade Range experienced fire much more often between 1500 and 1895 than had been previously thought, according to new research by scientists at Oregon State University. The findings provide important insight, the authors say, into how landscapes might adapt to climate change and future fire regimes. James Johnston of the OSU College of Forestry led the study, which was published in Ecosphere. “Wildland fire is a fundamental forest ecosystem process,” he said. “With temperatures rising and more and more area burning, we need to know as much as we can about the long-term variability in fire.” Johnson and collaborators at Oregon State, the University of Oregon and the U.S. Forest Service gathered tree ring data at 16 sites in the southern part of the Willamette National Forest, in the general vicinity of Oakridge. Trees form scars after cambial cells are killed by wildfire heat, he said. These scars are partially or completely covered by new tissue as a tree grows, and tree rings tell the story of when the fire exposure occurred. Using chain saws, the scientists collected samples from 311 dead trees – logs, short snags and stumps. Seventy-three percent of the samples were coastal Douglas-fir, and 13% were ponderosa pine. The remainder were sugar pine, noble fir, red fir, incense cedar, western red cedar, mountain hemlock and western hemlock. “We cross-dated a total of 147,588 tree rings and identified 672 cambial injuries, 479 of which were fire scars,” Johnston said. “The scars allowed us to reconstruct 130 different fire years that occurred at one or more of the 16 sites before a federal policy of fire suppression went into effect early in the 20th century.” The main takeaways: • Fire was historically far more frequent in western Oregon Cascades landscapes than previously believed. • Indigenous peoples likely used fire to manage large areas for resources and probably altered landscapes and fire regimes in significant ways. • There are important present-day restoration opportunities for fire-adapted systems in western Oregon. “Also, our study produced little evidence of the kind of large, wind-driven fires that in 2020 burned 50,000 to 75,000 hectares in the watersheds immediately to the north and south of our study area,” Johnston said. “Only 39% of fire years were recorded at more than one site, only 11% were recorded at more than two sites, and only 3% at more than three sites – in a study area of 37,000 acres, that strongly suggests that most historical fires were relatively small.” Across all 16 sites, the average fire return interval – the length of time between fires – was as short as six years and as long as 165. In general the differences in those averages were strongly associated with vapor pressure deficit or VPD, basically the drying power of the atmosphere. The higher the VPD, the shorter the time between fires. However, historical fire in stands seral to Douglas-fir – stands that, if left alone, would end up with Douglas-fir as the dominant tree species – was much less strongly linked with dry air. “We interpret the extraordinary tempo of fire in those stands, and the climate pattern associated with fire there, to indicate Indigenous fire stewardship,” Johnston said. “We saw some of the most frequent fire return intervals ever documented in the Pacific Northwest, but the enormous volume of biomass that these moist forests accumulate over time is often partly attributed to long intervals between wildfire.” The authors note that humans have occupied the southern part of what is now the Willamette National Forest for at least 10,000 years. A variety of Indigenous cultures, including the Molalla, Kalapuya, Tenino, Wasco, Klamath, Northern Paiute and Cayuse, probably used the area for trading, hunting and the collection of plants. “Removals happened very quickly, with most Native people taken to the Grand Ronde, Warm Springs and Klamath reservations,” said co-author David Lewis, a member of the Grand Ronde Tribe and an assistant professor of anthropology and Indigenous studies in OSU’s College of Liberal Arts. “Removal of the tribes took their cultural stewardship practices, their use of annual cultural fires, from the land, radically altering how the forests were managed.” By 1856, most remaining members of Willamette Valley and western Oregon Cascades tribes had been forcibly removed to reservations. Extensive clearcut logging on the Willamette National Forest started in the late 1940s and continued for four decades. “Now, Forest Service managers want fine-grained information about forest vegetation and historical disturbance dynamics to manage lands in ways that promote resilience to climate change,” Johnston said. He added that the Forest Service is working closely with the Southern Willamette Forest Collaborative, a group based in Oakridge, to plan a variety of restoration treatments. Joining Johnston and Lewis on the paper were the College of Forestry’s Micah Schmidt, now working with the Umatilla Tribe in northeastern Oregon, and Andrew Merschel. Co-authors also included William Downing of the U.S. Forest Service and the University of Oregon’s Michael Coughlan. The Oregon Department of Forestry funded the study.
