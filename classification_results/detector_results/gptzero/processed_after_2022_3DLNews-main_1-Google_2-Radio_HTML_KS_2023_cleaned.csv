The small municipal airport sits in a state where abortion is now banned in virtually all cases. But a short flight away in Kansas, it remains legal. That’s launched a wave of travel from across the South and Midwest in pursuit of pills and procedures no longer legal in many places. Michael — who asked to only use his first name — is part of a growing group of hobby pilots who have begun ferrying people across state lines to get abortions and gender-affirming medical care, flouting local restrictions and bans. They’re volunteers with Elevated Access, an Illinois-based group that operates with degrees of secrecy because its work falls into gray legal territory. The flights spare people seeking stigmatized medical care from the costs, delays, and security checkpoints that go along with traditional travel. “There are tons of little airports like this dotted all over,” Michael says. “I try to avoid the big airports. Usually, we fly into one that’s closer to where they live.” Pilots donate their time and the use of their planes. Most also cover the cost of fuel, because private pilots can’t legally be compensated for flying. (The group is trying to get an exemption that would allow it to reimburse fuel costs.) Recently, Michael took a woman back home to the Deep South after an appointment at a Kansas clinic. He loves to fly — he also does volunteer flights for an animal rescue group and he jumps at the chance to take family and friends up in the sky. But he said the Elevated Access flight felt different. “It’s maybe not the best time in a particular person’s life, or they’re going through a sensitive thing,” he said. “So I treat that with a lot of reverence.” Only a handful of people in Michael’s life know he’s part of the budding network of people helping women get abortions that have become illegal in their home states. He says some members of his family and some of his pilot friends oppose abortion. That’s not surprising — pilots tend to be older, whiter and more conservative than Americans generally. Fewer than 10% are women. Soon after Roe v. Wade was overturned last summer and Elevated Access was launched, Michael posted a link to the organization in an online pilot forum. The blowback came immediately. “It was obviously a polarizing thing to have shared,” he said. “I’m glad I made quite a few pilots aware of it, even if it raised some ire. But I don’t talk about it a lot since then.” For pilots like Michael, most of whom have day jobs, the flights offer a chance to keep their flying skills sharp while supporting a cause they believe in. But for people trying to get to an abortion appointment several states away — maybe with just a few days’ notice — private flights can be game-changing. They can turn a multi-day drive into just a couple of hours, and they can take off much closer to a passenger’s home than a commercial airport. Elevated Access makes the flights free to passengers, who won’t have to purchase an expensive, last-minute plane ticket. And they’re virtually anonymous. Pilots only know a passengers’ first name and weight (to avoid exceeding small aircraft weight limits). “We don’t check ID because that’s not part of private aviation. There’s no ticketing or TSA or anything like that,” said Mike (not to be confused with Michael), the founder of Elevated Access. “If somebody feels like they need to use a fake first name, they can definitely do that.” Pilots are instructed not to ask passengers why they’re traveling. That relieves passengers of any pressure to explain or justify the services they’re seeking. But it’s also intended to give pilots plausible deniability in the face of potential legal threats. Some states are considering prosecuting those who help people get abortions, and Texas has already made them liable to lawsuits. No existing laws specifically target interstate travel, although Idaho could soon make it a crime to help a minor travel out of state for an abortion without parental consent. But legal experts say flying for Elevated Access still might involve some legal risk. “You could see an aggressive prosecutor trying to say, under the current laws, that, ‘We are going to charge this pilot with being an accessory to murder or an accessory to abortion,’” said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University. “We haven’t seen prosecutors try that yet.

More than 200 pilots have been vetted and more than 1,000 have expressed interest. “We don’t share our full numbers because we don’t want to become a target,” the group’s founder said. “We want to seem small for as long as possible.” The flights represent a minuscule fraction of the flood of abortion-related travel between states since many began enforcing bans last summer.

The Kansas News Service reports that the money will go to 18 organizations across the state. Carla Smith, the executive director of Rise Up Reno Prevention Network in Hutchinson, confirmed that her organization will use its grant to create an alliance of law enforcement, EMS, schools and other agencies. “We are aware that there are differences between the ways that different agencies react or try to assist when kids are involved in a crisis situation,” Smith said. Smith says the alliance will create a protocol for crises involving kids and drugs. The Governor’s office estimates more than 140,000 children in Kansas live in households where their parents or caregivers use illegal substances. ========== Kansas Is Voting on a New License Plate After Complaints Scuttled an Earlier Design TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas has opened voting on five proposed designs for a new license plate, including one that closely resembles a previous design criticized and pulled for being uninspired, reminding people of the University of Missouri and too closely resembling one of New York\'s plates. Governor Laura Kelly\'s office announced Monday that voting online was open as of 9 a.m. and that it would close Friday at 5 p.m. A website set up by the state requires voters to give their names and ZIP codes. Only votes from Kansas ZIP codes will be counted. “I encourage Kansans to make their voices heard and am looking forward to announcing the winner next week,"" Kelly said in a statement. Each proposed plate features a combination of seven numbers and letters in black and the first half of the state\'s motto, “To the stars,” at the bottom. The Democratic governor\'s administration recalled the second part of the state\'s motto — “through difficulties” — in rolling out the previous design the day before Thanksgiving. Members of the Republican-controlled Legislature immediately threatened to intervene once lawmakers reconvene in January. Some critics thought the navy blue and gold design was drab and ugly. Others thought the design too closely recalled the University of Missouri\'s gold and black colors. Still others, including Attorney General Kris Kobach, a Republican, noted its resemblance to a New York plate known as “Empire Gold.” Nevertheless, one of the five designs resembles the previous design. Others feature wheat stalks, sunflowers and the Statehouse dome. The state is replacing its current design of navy numbers and letters on light blue because the plates have deteriorated and become harder for police to read. The original plan was to start giving motorists the plate with the now-disfavored design in March when they renewed their vehicle registrations, charging them 50 cents for the required rear plate unless they wanted to pay an extra $45 for a specialized plate. Kelly said that her office had received some designs from the public and said some of them were “beautiful.” However, she said the state is moving ahead with voting now on five designs ""to get safer plates on the streets as soon as possible.” (Read more.) ========== Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Identified in Two Kansas Egg-Laying Facilities UNDATED (KNS) – Severe bird flu has cropped up in two egg-laying facilities in central Kansas.

(KCUR) – A second protest is planned at Shawnee Mission East High School in Prairie Village, after a racially charged altercation between students began circulating nationally on social media. KCUR reports that the Black Student Solidarity Network is planning a protest at Shawnee Mission East High School this week after a video published by the KC Defender showed a white male student hurling racial slurs and punching a Black student in the face. The Kansas City Star reported that students said the girl suffered a broken nose and was sent to the hospital. The Kansas City Star reports the white male student has been charged with felony aggravated battery for his actions. ========== Meteorologists Say Recent Snowfall Unusual for November UNDATED (KNS) – Last weekend’s heavy snowfall in Kansas was very unusual for November, according to the assistant state climatologist. Matthew Sittel is based at Kansas State University, and says snow this time of year can help the soil because the ground isn’t frozen yet and can soak up the moisture. “Early season snow – great thing for the state. Once it falls and accumulates, and that snowpack is sitting there, it’s gradually melting from below because it\'s sitting on ground that’s above freezing,” Sittel told the Kansas News Service. Eastern and Central Kansas suffered very dry growing seasons this year. Last weekend’s storm brought more than a foot of snow to some parts of central Kansas – the equivalent of about one inch of rain. Wichita received about 8 inches of snow, Dodge City recorded about 5 inches, and Hays and Colby logged between 2 and 3 inches. Parts of northeastern Kansas got more than half a foot of snow, with Topeka officially recording 7.2 inches. Lawrence reported 5.4 inches. ========== Former KCMO Mayor Dick Berkley Dies UNDATED (KC Star) – Former Kansas City Mayor Richard L. ""Dick"" Berkley has died at the age of 92.

The Kansas News service reports that school districts across the state are updating their graduation requirements to match changes approved last fall by the state Board of Education. Starting with the class of 2028, graduates will need a half-credit each of health and financial literacy, and two credits earned outside the classroom, such as work experience or volunteer hours.They’ll also need a communications class such as speech, debate or journalism, according to Holly Ingram with Wichita schools. “I think we all know it’s more than just writing papers and reading literature, which is a skill we all need, but also having those communication skills both in the workplace and in college,” Ingram said. The changes to Kansas graduation requirements are the first in about 20 years. ========== Men from Mexico Indicted on Drug Trafficking Charges in Kansas WICHITA, Kan.

(KPR) — The American bison was adopted as the official state animal of Kansas in 1955. It\'s often called the American buffalo, but bison is the preferred scientific term. A recent PBS documentary tells the story of the bison, which once numbered in the millions across the Great Plains. The animal was nearly killed off by government decree, but KPR Commentator Rex Buchanan says a Kansas man helped save the animal from extinction. ""Charles \'Buffalo\' Jones was, in the 1870s, a buffalo hunter. But he moved to Finney County in southwestern Kansas, gave up hunting, and began collecting bison,"" Buchanan said. Jones eventually sold his Kansas herd but continued his interest in bison, buying and breeding the animals in New Mexico and eventually in Yellowstone. ""He’s at least part of the reason bison are still around today,"" Buchanan said. (Hear the whole story and learn where you can see buffalo herds in Kansas.) ========== Topeka Council Plans to Extend Contract for Interim City Manager TOPEKA, Kan.

(Topeka Capital-Journal) — The emergency room at Topeka\'s University of Kansas Health System-St. Francis has been affected by a recent ransomware attack upon one of its owners, Ardent Health Services. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that St. Francis was among an unspecified number of hospitals where emergency rooms were placed on ""divert status"" Friday as a precaution. When a hospital invokes divert status, it directs incoming ambulances to other facilities, in this case, Topeka\'s other major hospital, Stormont-Vail. Ardent, which owns St. Francis in partnership with the University of Kansas Health System, has suspended all user access to its information technology applications. (Read more.) (– Additional Reporting – ) Ransomware Attack Prompts Multistate Hospital Chain to Divert Some Emergency Room Patients Elsewhere NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A ransomware attack has prompted a health care chain that operates 30 hospitals in six states to divert patients from some of its emergency rooms to other hospitals while postponing certain elective procedures. Ardent Health Services said it took its network offline after the Nov. 23 cyberattack, adding in a statement that it suspended user access to information technology applications such as software used to document patient care. By Tuesday afternoon, more than half of Ardent\'s 25 emergency rooms had resumed accepting some patients by ambulance or by fully lifting their “divert"" status, Ardent spokesperson Will Roberts said. Divert status means hospitals have asked ambulances to take people needing emergency care to other nearby facilities. Roberts said hospitals nationwide have at times used divert status during flu season, COVID-19 surges, natural disasters and large trauma events. The company said it could not'}]"
