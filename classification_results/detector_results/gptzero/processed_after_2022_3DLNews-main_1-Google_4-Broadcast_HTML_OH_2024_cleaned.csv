Related: Browns\' Myles Garrett Channels His Inner LeBron James After Winning DPOY Perhaps the most surprising win of the night though came in the Comeback Player of the Year category, where veteran QB Joe Flacco nudged out Bills safety Damar Hamlin to claim the prize. Hamlin actually had more first place votes that the Browns signal caller but lost based on total points from the voting. For Flacco, the award served as a a nice memento to put a bow on his historic and magical run with the Browns. Joining the team in Week 12, the Super Bowl champion provided an unpredictable spark for Cleveland, putting up four consecutive 300-plus yard outings in five starts to help the team clinch a playoff berth. The rags-to-riches, off the couch to quarterbacking a playoff team was something out of Hollywood and captivated fans across the league. Apparently it caught the attention of the voters as well. After winning the award – which last month he conceded should go to Hamlin –Flacco shared a heartfelt message for the city that embarked on that memorable journey with him at the end of the season. ""Big thanks to the city of Cleveland, everybody in Cleveland,"" Flacco began. ""I want to say thank you to my teammates just for welcoming me into that locker room at that point in the year. To welcome a new guy is not the easiest thing, so want to say thank you to those guys. Want to say thank you to the organization for just giving me the opportunity to do what I love to do, and that\'s play football. And I want to say thank you to the city just for making me and my family feel at home for a couple months."" Just an unbelievable year for Joe Flacco. He brings home Comeback Player of the Year. pic.twitter.com/XNBH2MTt56 There\'s no guarantee that Flacco will be back with the team next year. Browns vice president of football operations Andrew Berry expressed that he\'d be open to bringing Flacco back at his end of the season presser, but avoided making any guarantees. That means, as the 16-year veteran eluded to, Browns fans may be left hanging onto those couple months where they could call Joe Flacco one of them. Even in that short amount of time though, he provided the city and it\'s passionate fan base with memories they won\'t soon forget.'}]"

(TND) — The U.S. national debt is expected to grow by an eye-opening $21 trillion over the next nine years, as interest rates continue their upward trajectory, according to a new Congressional Budget Office report. The new numbers come as the election season heats up, and as other issues take priority. The CBO\'s report shows the debt held by the public will go from $26.2 trillion at the end of 2023 and hit $48 trillion by the end of 2034. Taxpayers are on the hook for that load, but right now there is a large imbalance between the amount of tax revenue the government is pulling in and the amount it\'s spending. While government spending is slated to grow from 22.7% of GDP this year to 24.1% within a decade, tax revenue will only grow from 16.5% of GDP to 17.1% in 2025 before it eventually rises to 17.9% by 2034, the report shows. Two of the most important trust funds -- Social Security and the Highway Trust Fund -- are edging toward insolvency. The latter will be depleted in four years; Social Security\'s fund will hang on until 2033. Medicare will be out of cash by the mid-2030s, according to the CBO\'s outlook. Once insolvent, beneficiaries of these programs face substantial cuts across the board. Meanwhile, voters turn their focus to the election in November. The general election is still several months away, but as it stands, President Joe Biden is running for re-election and, if he wins his party\'s nomination, he could face an old nemesis: former President Donald Trump. Neither of the candidates has talked much about ways to tackle those debt levels, to say nothing of what\'s needed to stabilize Social Security, according to Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. As Trump seeks a second term, the GOP front-runner is promising to “always protect” Social Security, according to his campaign website. Biden is promising to protect Social Security from cuts, a position that many Republicans in Congress now appear to support. “We’re not going to hurt the people who’ve been paying into Social Security their whole life and then all of a sudden they’re supposed to get less,” Trump said in a Feb. 2016 debate during his first presidential campaign. The candidates who are no longer in the race were the ones focused on debt and SS reforms, Goldwein told The National Desk. Along with publicizing the debt level, his group is also tracking whether presidential candidates are taking on the U.S.\'s financial standing. As it stands, the healthcare system is the top issue for a plurality of Americans (43%), while 35% of Americans say terrorism and national security are the most important, a CivicScience survey of voters found in January. Immigration rounded out voters\' biggest concern heading into November. Most of those voters are older Americans. About 52% of registered voters headed into the 2020 election were ages 50 and older, up from 41% in 1996, according to a Pew Research survey. That\'s the case for Republicans and Democrats, with 56% of GOP-leaning voters above 50, up from 39% in 1996. The same is true for half of Democratic voters going into that year. That\'s creating a feedback loop, Goldwein argues. One reason why Social Security and Medicare costs have ""exploded"" is because ""more people are on them, which means they have more political support, which means fewer people want to touch them,"" he said. Social Security and Medicare are two of the largest drivers of the national debt. And with the debt driving upward, it\'s prompting even Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to warn about a potential fiscal calamity. The debt is ""growing faster than the economy, so it is unsustainable,” he told CBS News earlier this month. Before making the comment, Powell said he preferred to stay in his own lane, that being monetary policy, which focuses mainly on moderating interest rate levels; increasing them if inflation is too high and reducing them if the economy needs a jolt. Budget experts say one of the best ways to tackle high debt loads -- aside from making substantial cuts to social programs -- is to make investments in the agency tasked with generating tax revenue -- the IRS. Improving the agency\'s ability to collect taxes can go a long way toward bringing down the debt load. it comes with ancillary benefits as well, Goldwein argues. ""You don\'t have to raise anyone\'s taxes,"" he said, as making the process more efficient acts as its own revenue generator. Goldwein added: ""You don\'t have to cut anyone\'s tax breaks."" Before the Inflation Reduction Act provided the IRS with more funding, generating revenue was a challenge, as was conducting audits. The audit rate for millionaires fell by more than 70% from 2010 and 2019, according to a new report by the Treasury Department. For corporations, that number was 50%. To get around that problem, ""all you have to say is that we\'re going to do a better job of collecting the revenue, collecting the taxes that people already owe,"" Goldwein said.'}]"

""I just then started thinking about all the things I could have, should have done maybe with him,” De Niro said. “I don\'t know if that would\'ve made a difference.

Rodriguez, 19, reportedly had fentanyl, bromazolam, alprazolam, 7-aminoclonazepam, ketamine and cocaine in his system at the time of his death, which was officially ruled as an accidental overdose, TMZ reported in August. Sofia Haley Marks, 20, an alleged drug dealer reportedly known as the \'Percocet Princess,\' was federally charged with distribution of narcotics, police sources told the New York Post on July 13. Marks was reportedly arrested during what was described as an undercover sting operation conducted by the New York Police Department, Drug Enforcement Administration and Homeland Security, the sources confirmed. Rodriguez\'s mother, Drena De Niro, had previously written that her son was suspected of having died from fentanyl-laced pills. ""Someone sold him fentanyl-laced pills that they knew were laced yet still sold them to him,"" she wrote in response to a commenter who asked about her son\'s cause of death. “So for all these people still f***ing around selling and buying this s–t, my son is gone forever,” she added. Drena paid tribute to her late son in a post shared on Instagram. ""I can barely type through my tears but all the love , the messages , calls , texts ,emails, the friends and family that held me up these last 24 hrs I’ve not been able to respond yet but we’re grateful for the all your love and condolences,"" she wrote.

(AP) — An asteroid as big as a skyscraper will pass within 1.7 million miles of Earth on Friday. Don’t worry: There’s no chance of it hitting us since it will pass seven times the distance from Earth to the moon. NASA’s Center for Near Earth Object Studies estimates the space rock is between 690 feet and 1,575 feet (210 meters and 480 meters) across. That means the asteroid could be similar in size to New York City’s Empire State Building or Chicago’s Willis Tower. Discovered in 2008, the asteroid is designated as 2008 OS7. It won’t be back our way again until 2032, but it will be a much more distant encounter, staying 45 million miles (72 million kilometers) away. The harmless flyby is one of several encounters this week. Three much smaller asteroids also will harmlessly buzz Earth on Friday, no more than tens of yards (meters) across, with another two on Saturday. On Sunday, an asteroid roughly half the size of 2008 0S7 will swing by, staying 4.5 million miles (7.3 million kilometers) away. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

why a private jet tried to make an emergency landing on a Florida interstate, colliding with a vehicle and sparking a fiery crash that left two people dead. The Federal Aviation Administration said the Bombardier Challenger 600 jet had five people aboard when the crash happened around 3:15 p.m. Friday near Naples, just north of where the interstate heads east toward Fort Lauderdale along what is known as Alligator Alley. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate, with the NTSB leading the investigation. One NTSB investigator arrived at the crash site Friday afternoon, with several more expected to arrive on Saturday. Brianna Walker saw the wing of the plane drag the car in front of hers and slam into the wall. ""It\'s seconds that separated us from the car in front of us,"" she said. ""The wing pulverized this one car."" Walker and her friend spotted the plane moments before it hit the highway, allowing her friend to pull over before the crash. ""The plane was over our heads by inches,"" she said. ""It took a hard right and skid across the highway."" Walker said an explosion of flames then burst from the plane with a loud boom. Pieces of the plane littered the highway. The plane had taken off from an airport at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, at about 1 p.m. and was scheduled to land in Naples around the time of the crash, Naples Airport Authority spokesperson Robin King said. A pilot had contacted the tower requesting an emergency landing, saying they had lost both engines. The pilot was cleared to land on a runway but replied ""we\'re not going to make the runway. We\'ve lost both engines,"" according to a tape of the call cited by the the Naples Daily News. The tower lost contact, and then airport workers saw the smoke from the interstate just a few miles away, King said. King said they sent fire trucks with special foam to the scene, and three of the five people on board were taken from the wreckage alive. Collier County Sheriff\'s Office spokesperson Adam Fisher confirmed two deaths but said he didn\'t immediately know whether the victims had been passengers on the plane or were on the ground. According to the FlightAware aircraft tracker, the plane was operated by Hop-a-Jet Worldwide Charter based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The aircraft had been scheduled to fly back to Fort Lauderdale Friday afternoon. Hop-a-Jet said Friday night that it had ""received confirmed reports of an accident involving one of our leased aircraft near Naples"" and would send a team to the crash site, the Naples Daily News reported. ""Our immediate concern is for the well-being of our passengers, crew members, and their families,"" the statement said. It didn\'t contain details of the crash. A spokesperson for Ohio State University said the aircraft is not affiliated with the university, and they had no further information about it. Federal authorities said a preliminary report about the cause of the crash can be expected in 30 days. Trending stories at Scrippsnews.com'}]"

COLUMBUS, Ohio (WOSU) — Former Public Utilities Commission of Ohio Chair Samuel Randazzo is requesting that the judge in charge of his criminal case move the trial from Cincinnati to Columbus. Randazzo, 74, is asking the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Ohio Judge Timothy Black to transfer the trial from Black’s courtroom to Columbus, citing his own health and that many of the witnesses the defense is likely to call live in the state capital. Randazzo was indicted and pleaded not guilty in December on charges he took more than $4.3 million in bribes from FirstEnergy, while he lead the government arm charged with regulating utility companies. Randazzo and his legal team said in a filing Thursday that most of the key events in the indictment either allegedly occurred in Columbus or outside the Southern District court entirely in Akron where FirstEnergy is based. Former Public Utilities Commission of Ohio chair Sam Randazzo leaves federal court in Cincinnati accompanied by his wife and his lawyer Roger Sugarman on Dec. 4, 2023. [Zack Carreon |WVXU]The filing said that the defense’s potential witnesses could include multiple parties that have closer connections to these two cities rather than Cincinnati: Among other reasons for wanting to move the trial, the filing said Randazzo lives only two miles from Joseph. P. Kinneary U.S. Courthouse in Columbus. The U.S. Courthouse in Cincinnati is located about 100 miles from Columbus. The filing claimed Randazzo suffers from chronic health issues that could make sitting in a car for long periods of time a problem. Randazzo and his team asking to move the trial comes less than a year after former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder was convicted and sentenced by Black to 20 years in prison for racketeering involving $60 million in bribes. Randazzo was charged in December with 11 counts, including one count of conspiring to commit travel act bribery and honest services wire fraud, two counts of travel act bribery, two counts of honest services wire fraud, one count of wire fraud and five counts of making illegal monetary transactions. Randazzo served as chairman of PUCO from April 2019 until November 2020, when he resigned days after the FBI raided his home in Columbus. He had just been implicated in a FirstEnergy report that said several former executives improperly made a $4 million payment last year to a firm tied to a future Ohio utility regulator. Randazzo is one of several public officials to be charged in the federal corruption investigation involving FirstEnergy, Householder and several top lobbyists. In addition to Householder’s conviction, lobbyist Matt Borges, former chair of the Ohio Republican Party, was sentenced to five years. Lobbyist Juan Cespedes and Jeffrey Longstreth, a top Householder political strategist, pleaded guilty in October 2020. The third person who was arrested, statehouse lobbyist Neil Clark, pleaded not guilty before dying by suicide in March 2021. The dark money group used to funnel FirstEnergy money, Generation Now, also pleaded guilty to a racketeering charge in February 2021. All were accused of using the $60 million in secretly funded FirstEnergy cash to get Householder’s chosen Republican candidates elected to the House in 2018 and then to help him be elected speaker in January 2019. The money was then used to win passage of the tainted energy legislation, House Bill 6, and to conduct what authorities have said was a $38 million dirty-tricks campaign to prevent a repeal referendum from reaching the ballot. Prosecutors have not yet filed a response to Randazzo’s motion to move the trial to Columbus. For more about Randazzo and the House Bill 6 scandal, listen to WOSU’s The Power Grab podcast.'}]"
