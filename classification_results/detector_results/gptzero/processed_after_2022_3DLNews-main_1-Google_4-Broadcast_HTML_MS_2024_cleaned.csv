Trump walked onstage to cheers and chants of “USA,” stayed at the end to sign autographs and heard one audience member blurt out “love you” after he took her question. He was barely challenged by questioners who left several challenging topics on the table — like Trump’s false claims about the 2020 election, his support for Capitol insurrectionists and legal arguments this week in which his lawyers claimed he had immunity from any potential crimes he might have conducted while in office. When asked about his previous statements that a second term as president would be about retribution for his enemies, Trump said he wouldn’t have time for it. “The ultimate retribution,” he said, “is success.” It was Trump’s first live appearance on Fox News since 2022, and how the network handled it was closely watched. It came less than a year after Fox agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems $787 million to settle a lawsuit related to lies told in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Fox instituted a soft ban against Trump in the opening days of the Biden administration, and the former president has complained about some of its personalities being insufficiently loyal to him. His standing atop 2024 presidential polls, however, put him in a position of strength. While Fox held Iowa town halls with Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley outside of prime-time hours in the past week, Trump’s town hall aired in direct competition with the CNN debate between his two rivals. Moderators Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum had their own challenge: not to allow the town hall to go off the rails, as a similar town hall televised by CNN last May did, while also not alienating a network audience filled with Trump supporters. They did it by not interrupting Trump with fact-checks. After Trump criticized how DeSantis responded to COVID as governor of Florida, MacCallum said, “DeSantis would argue with your characterization.” During an abortion discussion, when Trump suggested “radical” Democrats supported killing babies after they were born, it was not challenged. The event stood in contrast to sharp questioning by CNN’s debate moderators, who put both candidates on the defense at points and revealed some policy differences between Haley and DeSantis. Baier asked Trump whether he could say that political violence is never acceptable. The former president said, “Of course, that’s right,” but then said that President Joe Biden “is bedlam.” His court fights came up when MacCallum asked how he’d respond to a DeSantis statement about a potential Trump general election campaign being essentially left up to a jury in a Washington, D.C., courtroom. “It’s a witch hunt,” Trump said. He was interrupted several times by applause and even laughter — like when he said about former rival Chris Christie, who was caught on a hot mic Wednesday saying that Haley was going to get “smoked” in the voting, that it was “one of the few things he’s been right about.” The majority of questioners said they were Trump supporters, including one expected caucusgoer who returned to the former president after attending one of the other candidate town halls, saying she had been undecided. One man, who said he was a Trump supporter, said some of his friends had turned away from the former president because they feared “four years of chaos due to your haters.” Trump — and the audience — backed that characterization. “Most of the chaos was caused by Democrats constantly going after me,” he said, to the audience’s applause. For Trump, the appearance capped off a pre-primary season where he refused to appear at any debates featuring his rivals. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A special counsel report released Thursday found evidence that President Joe Biden willfully retained and shared highly classified information when he was a private citizen, including about military and foreign policy in Afghanistan, but concluded that criminal charges were not warranted. The report from special counsel Robert Hur resolves a criminal investigation that had shadowed Biden\'s presidency for the last year. But its bitingly critical assessment of his handling of sensitive government records and unflattering characterizations of his memory will spark fresh questions about his competency and age that cut at voters’ most deep-seated concerns about his candidacy for re-election. Beyond that, the harsh findings will almost certainly blunt his ability to forcefully condemn Donald Trump, Biden\'s likely opponent in November\'s presidential election, over a criminal indictment charging the former president with illegally hoarding classified records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Despite abundant differences between the cases, Trump immediately seized on the special counsel report to portray himself as a victim of a “two-tiered system of justice.” Yet even as Hur found evidence that Biden willfully held onto and shared with a ghostwriter highly classified information, the special counsel devoted much of his report to explaining why he did not believe the evidence met the standard for criminal charges, including a high probability that the Justice Department would not be able to prove Biden’s intent beyond a reasonable doubt, citing among other things an advanced age that they said made him forgetful and the possibility of “innocent explanations” for the records that they could not refute. In remarks at the White House, Biden angrily lashed out at the special counsel for questioning his recollection of his late son Beau\'s death from cancer. “How in the hell dare he raise that?"" Biden asked, saying he didn\'t believe it was any of Hur\'s business. Speaking to reporters, Biden asserted, “My memory is fine,"" and insisted he believes he remains the most qualified person to serve as president. Video below: \'My memory is fine:\' President Biden responds to special counsel\'s report Biden\'s lawyers blasted the report for what they said were inaccuracies and gratuitous swipes at the president. In a statement, Biden said he was “pleased” Hur had “reached the conclusion I believed all along they would reach — that there would be no charges brought in this case and the matter is now closed.” He pointedly noted that he had sat for five hours of in-person interviews in the immediate aftermath of Hamas\'s October attack on Israel, when ""I was in the middle of handling an international crisis.” “I just believed that’s what I owed the American people so they could know no charges would be brought and the matter closed,” Biden said. The investigation into Biden is separate from special counsel Jack Smith’s inquiry into the handling of classified documents by Trump after Trump left the White House. Smith’s team has charged Trump with illegally retaining top secret records at his Mar-a-Lago home and then obstructing government efforts to get them back. Trump has said he did nothing wrong. Hur, a former U.S. Attorney in the Trump administration, was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland as special counsel in January 2023 following an initial discovery by Biden staff of classified records in Washington office space. Subsequent property searches by the FBI, all coordinated voluntarily by Biden staff, that turned up additional sensitive documents from his time as vice president and senator. Hur\'s report said many of the documents recovered at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, in parts of Biden\'s Delaware home and in his Senate papers at the University of Delaware were retained by “mistake.” Read: President Biden issues statement in response to special counsel classified documents report Biden could not have been prosecuted as a sitting president, but Hur’s report states that he would not recommend charges against Biden regardless. “We would reach the same conclusion even if Department of Justice policy did not foreclose criminal charges against a sitting president,” the report said. But investigators did find evidence of willful retention and disclosure of a subset of records found in Biden\'s Wilmington, Delaware house, including in a garage, office and basement den. The files pertain to a troop surge in Afghanistan during the Obama administration that Biden had vigorously opposed. He kept records that documented his position, including a classified letter to Obama during the 2009 Thanksgiving holiday. Documents found in a box in Biden\'s Delaware garage have classification markings up to the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information Level and “other materials of great significance to him and that he appears to have personally used and accessed.” Hur, though, wrote that there was a ”shortage of evidence"" to prove that Biden placed the documents in the box and knew they were there. Some of the classified information related to Afghanistan was shared with a ghostwriter with whom he published memoirs in 2007 and 2017. As part of the probe, investigators reviewed a recording of a February 2017 conversation between Biden and his ghostwriter in which Biden can be heard saying that he had “just found all the classified stuff downstairs.” Prosecutors believe Biden’s comment, made at a time he was renting a home in Virginia, referred to the same documents FBI agents later found in his Delaware house. Though Biden sometimes skipped over presumptively classified material while reading notebook entries to his ghostwriter, the report says, at other times he read aloud classified entries “verbatim."" The report said there was some evidence to suggest that Biden knew he could not keep classified handwritten notes at home after leaving office, citing his deep familiarity “with the measures taken to safeguard classified information and the need for those measures to prevent harm to national security.” Yet, prosecutors say, he kept notebooks containing classified information in unlocked drawers at home. “He had strong motivations to do so and to ignore the rules for properly handing the classified information in his notebooks,” the report said. “He consulted the notebooks liberally during hours of discussions with his ghostwriter and viewed them as highly private and valued possessions with which he was unwilling to part.” While the report removes legal jeopardy for the president, it is nonetheless an embarrassment for Biden, who placed competency and experience at the core of his rationale to voters to send him to the Oval Office. It says that Biden was known to remove and keep classified material from his briefing books for future use and that his staff struggled and sometimes failed to get those records back. Even so, Hur took pains to note the multiple reasons why prosecutors did not believe they could prove a criminal case beyond a reasonable doubt. Those include Biden’s “limited memory” both during his 2017 recorded conversations with the ghostwriter and in an interview with investigators last year in which, prosecutors say, he could not immediately remember the years in which he served as vice president. Hur said it was possible Biden could have found those records at his Virginia home in 2017 and then forgotten about them soon after. “Given Mr. Biden’s limited precision and recall during his interviews with his ghostwriter and with our office, jurors may hesitate to place too much evidentiary weight on a single eight-word utterance to his ghostwriter about finding classified documents in Virginia, in the absence of other, more direct evidence,” the report says “We have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” investigators wrote.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 12:40 am Special counsel Robert Hur Robert Hur promised a ""fair, impartial, and dispassionate"" investigation when the veteran prosecutor was appointed special counsel a year ago to look into allegations that Joe Biden mishandled classified documents. Hur, in his final report released this week, absolved Biden of any criminal wrongdoing, but ignited a political firestorm with his disparaging comments on the president\'s mental state. Hur\'s remarks about Biden\'s poor memory in his nearly 400-page report were attacked as ""gratuitous and inappropriate"" by the White House and seized upon by Republicans to push claims that the 81-year-old president is ""unfit"" to hold office. Hur, a Republican, was named by Attorney General Merrick Garland in January 2023 to look into Biden\'s alleged mishandling of classified materials after serving as vice president to Barack Obama. Announcing the appointment of a veteran of the Donald Trump administration to carry out the delicate probe into a sitting Democratic president, Garland said he was ""confident Mr Hur will carry out his responsibilities in an even-handed and urgent manner."" ""I will conduct the assigned investigation with fair, impartial, and dispassionate judgment,"" Hur said in a statement at the time. ""I intend to follow the facts swiftly and thoroughly, without fear or favor, and will honor the trust placed in me to perform this service."" A graduate of prestigious Harvard College and Stanford Law School, Hur worked as a law clerk to former US Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist. He served as an assistant US attorney in Maryland from 2007 to 2014 and as a senior aide to then-Justice Department deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein from 2017 to 2018. In comments to The Washington Post at the time, Rosenstein welcomed the appointment of his former deputy to look into Biden\'s handling of classified documents. ""Rob understands the need to ignore the politics and focus on what matters,"" Rosenstein said. ""He\'s not going to be influenced by partisan political considerations."" In 2017, Hur was appointed by Republican president Trump to be the US attorney for Maryland. He was confirmed unanimously by the Senate and served as the state\'s chief prosecutor until Biden took office. In his report released on Thursday, Hur said Biden had ""willfully retained"" classified documents but the ""evidence is not sufficient to convict"" and no criminal charges should be brought. Hur also described Biden as a ""well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory"" who allegedly could not remember when his son Beau died or the dates of his vice presidency. Biden defended himself in a surprise appearance before reporters on Thursday, saying ""my memory is fine,"" and Vice President Kamala Harris attacked Hur\'s comments on Friday as ""clearly politically motivated"" ahead of the November election expected to pit Biden against Trump once again. cl/acb Originally published on doc.afp.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.

I was pleased to see they reached the conclusion I believed all along they would reach – that there would be no charges brought in this case and the matter is now closed. This was an exhaustive investigation going back more than 40 years, even into the 1970s when I was a young Senator. I cooperated completely, threw up no roadblocks, and sought no delays. In fact, I was so determined to give the Special Counsel what they needed that I went forward with five hours of in-person interviews over two days on October 8th and 9th of last year, even though Israel had just been attacked on October 7th and I was in the middle of handling an international crisis. I just believed that’s what I owed the American people so they could know no charges would be brought and the matter closed. Over my career in public service, I have always worked to protect America’s security. I take these issues seriously and no one has ever questioned that.""
