Still, playing Whack-a-Mole against individual cases of misinformation is no substitute for providing credible information, according to state officials. Experts say awareness campaigns like #trustedinfo2020 are critical to improving public trust in the democratic process. But, they added, there\'s no single solution for a problem as abstract and multi-faceted as online misinformation, said Matt Sheehan, managing director of the Center for Public Interest Communications at the University of Florida. ""I wish there was a fix as simple as a hashtag, but it runs counter to how we\'re wired as humans,"" he said. ""Our personalities and worldviews color the information we find credible, or seek out as consumers."" The dedication of those trying to mislead voters, as well as the natural ebb and flow of ordinary misinformation, makes it hard for officials to compete, said Rachel Goodman, an attorney at the civil society nonprofit Protect Democracy. ""The unfortunate reality is, because there\'s so many resources on the misnformation side,"" she said, ""it\'s hard to see until we\'re really in the crucible how it really measures up."" By some estimates, the #trustedinfo2020 campaign doesn\'t appear to have spread very far. One researcher who analyzed the hashtag told CNN that since late last year, it has been mentioned in about 10,000 tweets, mostly in posts created by election officials themselves. NASS declined to comment. ""Ten thousand mentions since mid-November is a relatively low volume,"" said Ben Nimmo, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\'s Digital Forensic Research Lab. ""It shows there\'s been some pickup, but it\'s not a viral phenomenon yet."" Copyright 2024 by Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.'}]"
