CORRECTION: The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities tries to plow Priority One roads in 12 hours. However, Priority Two roads can take as long as 18 hours after the end of a storm, and Priority Three roads up to 24 hours. ORIGINAL STORY: The Golden Heart City saw at least six inches of snow accumulate on Tuesday and Wednesday, December 13 and 14, which means snow plows can be seen traversing interior roads. “If people are patient, then that keeps everybody safe,” said John Perreault, Public Information Officer with the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (DOT). When snow hits the roads in Interior Alaska, so do the snow plows from the DOT and the City of Fairbanks. The DOT is responsible for large and busy roads in the Fairbanks area. These include first priority routes like the Mitchell and Steese Expressways and the Johansen Expressway. Second priority roads for DOT to plow include Peger Road and Airport Way. On Wednesday, ten department plows entered the roads to clear accumulated snow, some including sanders. “On a day like today, we’ll have as many plows as we can get people into out. We have some groups that go out in up to six plows, so we can plow priority one highways in one pass,” explained Perreault. When on a route with a snow plow, the department recommends drivers keep their distance. “In many cases you’ll see a big green sign on the back that says ‘Keep Back 200 Feet.’ That’s recommended for your safety as well as to make sure that our operations can be done cleanly, without any interruption,” he said. Be sure to allow as much space as possible for a plow if sharing a road going in the opposite direction, according to Perreault. “Not only are they plowing, but often, especially in intersections, they’re going to be laying down gravel as well in order to assist traction for vehicles moving through those high-traffic areas.” When engaged plowing, these vehicles travel at most 35 miles an hour, to keep the snow they’re moving under control. However, the DOT does not recommend passing active plows while headed in the same direction. “There is snow that goes off in both directions, even a little bit to the left when they have an angled plow to the right. It’s recommended that you just wait for the plow, be patient and get somewhere safe,” Perreault said. DOT’s goal is to have all of its roads of responsibility plowed by 12 hours after a storm ends.
