(WSFA) - The Alabama Department of Corrections has released an Alabama inmate’s medical records after he signed a waiver allowing the department to do so. ADOC disclosed additional details about 32-year-old Kastellio Vaughan’s medical history that have contributed to his physical condition after images circulating online prompted a public outcry on social media. Thousands of people have shared a post made by a Mobile woman who says she received alarming images of her brother from inside the Elmore Correctional Facility saying, “get help.” The family from Mobile said when they last visited Vaughan in June of this year, he was healthy. But then, they said about three weeks ago, Vaughan called his family complaining about stomach issues. That’s when he told his family he asked for medical treatment. “And no one was giving it to him and when they did it was like the bare minimum,” his sister, Kacie Vaughan, said. The corrections department’s statement Tuesday disputes that it wasn’t offering treatment, saying Vaughan was admitted to Jackson Hospital on Aug 5. for a bowel obstruction and underwent surgery that was due to a complication from a previous gunshot wound. After the surgery, Vaughan chose to be discharged against medical advice on Aug. 10, according to the department of corrections. He was again admitted to Jackson Hospital on Sept. 3 for post-surgical complications. The corrections department said Vaughan opted to be discharged against medical advice on Sept. 7 and refused medications. The department said Vaughan has refused medical assessment and treatment while in custody following his return against medical advice from Jackson Hospital. “The ADOC offers medical assessment and treatment to all inmates but does not force them to accept that care,” the corrections department said in a statement. Vaughan is serving a 25-year sentence on multiple charges out of Baldwin and Mobile counties for unlawful breaking and entering a vehicle and first-degree robbery, according to court documents and a statement from ADOC.

Andy Pierrotti Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video Play Video Close Video Dubose\'s Death The Problem and The Proposal History of Violations ATLANTA This past March, a jury awarded $6 million to the family of a grandmother who died at a Gwinnett County nursing home with a history of violations. The case centered on a growing problem in the long-term care industry, leading some to believe it contributed to the woman’s death. President Biden believes his plan will help. Lucille Debose died in 2016 from complications of an untreated pressure wound 33 days after her family admitted her to the Life Care Center of Lawrenceville following a stroke. Dubose was also diagnosed with dementia. Pressure wounds are injuries to the skin and underlying tissue after prolonged pressure. It can be prevented by regularly moving patients. By the time a doctor discovered a sore, the lawsuit claims a hole the size of a hand had developed on the 77-year-old’s lower back. It was so deep that a doctor could see the bone.“She was hurt for 10 days, and no one did anything,” Michelle McKinney, Dubose’s daughter, said. An 11Alive investigation uncovered that staffing shortages at the facility likely contributed to Debose’s death. It’s a claim not made by the family but by at least three former Life Care employees who worked at the facility and treated Dubose, discovered through court depositions. “It was not sufficient staff. They would often ask you to do doubles,” Lakeisha Raymond, a former Life Care certified nursing assistant, said.“Unfortunately, the staffing issue was an issue,” Tabitha Freeman, a former Life Care nurse who also treated Dubose. “If you don\'t have the staffing to provide the care, then the patient loses out.” “They were understaffed,” Nikki Smith, another former Life Care nurse who worked at the Lawrenceville facility during the time, said. During the deposition with Raymond, attorneys asked her whether staffing shortages impacted patient care. Raymond said she and other CNAs were often too busy to give residents water. ""There just wasn’t time for that,"" he said. The long-time CNA also said staff often did not have enough time to give residents showers, and they would falsify records to conceal it. “We would just mark that they had the showers,” Raymond said. Life Care has appealed the jury’s verdict. They also declined 11Alive’s request for an interview. In a prepared statement, Life Care claims the facility “was never understaffed during Ms. Dubose’s residency.” The company said the facility “had twice the Georgia state-required staffing level for nursing hours per patient per day.” It also called the former employees \'disgruntled\' and said two of three were fired. Life Care said the third employee was once engaged to McKinney’s son, questioning her credibility. Court records show the employee was a witness for the company, not the family. The nurses were not the only employees concerned with staffing shortages. According to a company email obtained through court records, a hiring manager recognized the problem, too. “When I started, I became aware of the very high turnover at the facility,” said Linda John, the facility’s staff development coordinator at the time.John’s email to Life Care’s human resource office also announced her resignation, saying she was leaving because the facility’s director of nursing caused her \'mental anguish.\' For months leading up to Debose’s death, company emails show a corporate vice president repeatedly asked facility operators to limit overtime and the hours staff worked based on a formula the company used to reduce labor costs. “We are going to need to find some opportunities for labor reduction in just about every one of our buildings,” said the vice president in an August 2016 email to managers. “We have to really focus on actual census vs. labor daily and where we can reduce.” Since Dubose’s death, staffing shortages in the long-term care industry have reached a crisis. A new study by Seniorly, released in April, shows understaffed long-term care facilities in the U.S. doubled during the pandemic. That’s a 7.2% increase since 2020. Georgia ranks the 13th in the country, with 28.3% of facilities understaffed. The Georgia Health Care Association and the Georgia Center for Assisted Living say the problem is pervasive across all member facilities. “Prior to the pandemic, nursing homes were already experiencing workforce shortages due to chronic underfunding and an inability to pay competitive wages. COVID-19 has exacerbated these challenges, and centers continue to face a workforce crisis,” said Devon Barill, the director of communications for both organizations.Leading Age, a national organization representing 5,000 nonprofit long-term care providers, estimates that 400,000 people left the sector during the pandemic, and most of them will not come back.“So we\'re really facing an enormous gap, in terms of the number of staff we need and the number of staff who are available and willing to work,” said Katie Sloan, the organization’s CEO.

That ends on my watch,” said Biden during his State of Union speech in March. “Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure loved ones get the care they deserve and they expect and they will be looked at closely.” In February, his administration outlined a long list of proposals to do it. One includes establishing a minimum nursing home staffing requirement. The federal government would fund it. Over the next year, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is expected to conduct a study to determine the level and type of staffing needed.Sloan believes a study is needed, but she said the president’s proposal alone wouldn’t fix the problem. “I think the challenge for us right now is to come up with staffing ratios that are mandated, but we don\'t have the people there to fill those jobs. And we\'re going to be back to the same place we are now, but we\'ll be punished for not having adequate staff,” said Sloan.Leading Age believes raising the Medicaid reimbursement rate for long-term care providers is key to improving staffing. “Medicaid rates simply haven\'t kept up with the cost of care. And that deflates what we can pay our staff. So if you\'ve got a $100 a day gap in what Medicaid pays and the cost of providing quality care, it\'s unsustainable. We can\'t simply increase wages,” said Sloan.Life Care Center of Lawrenceville is not a member of Sloan’s organization. Atlanta Attorney Lance Lourie represents the Dubose family. He believes the nursing home industry does have enough money to fix staffing problems, but it chooses profits over patient care. “There\'s plenty of money there to provide good care and they\'re not going to convince me otherwise because I\'ve just been doing this too long,” said Lourie. The Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH) cited Life Care Center of Lawrenceville for numerous violations related to Dubose’s treatment.“The facility failed to notify the physician of a newly developed pressure ulcer and failed to obtain treatment orders for 10 days for [Dubose],” wrote a state investigator in inspection records in February 2017. “There was not any evidence of any documentation that any treatment orders were obtained or that [Dubose] was provided wound treatment for the open area to the resident’s sacrum,” said the inspection, which also noted staff’s inaction put Dubose in immediate jeopardy.

Together, seven of them saved a life - earning an award for their response and teamwork. They say ""Birds of a feather flock together,"" and when most of your family is dedicated to service - some things just come naturally. That\'s the case for Sergeant First Class Christopher Robinson. His army career has taken him all over the world. Now he’s back at Fort Gordon with a promotion and new training exercise for soldiers. This is the story of Joshua Kiernan - from pastor to sergeant. Nearly two decades ago, a soldier got his start in the IT field without a computer to his name. Now, he’s gone from student to teacher - leading soldiers with the skills he’s gained since then. It is National Hispanic Heritage Month! A soldier at Fort Gordon shows his pride through service - hoping to show that anything is possible. For one soldier, serving his country is a first, but helping others isn’t. Private First Class Dong Min Lee saved a fellow soldier\'s life before they got on the battlefield. A mother gave birth to her fourth child in a way she\'d never done before: in a car. It was a first for some Harlem Firefighters too; they never delivered a baby. Both say they will never forget the experience. Serving by faith and by heart: That’s Captain Tom Kelly. He works at a chaplain on Fort Gordon, but his journey there may not be one you’d expect. First responders take an oath: serve and protect. A local deputy has dedicated his life to it, even jumping in off duty to help in a time of need. FOX54 salutes Richmond County Sheriff\'s Office Sergeant Byrnie Hardin. For Drill Sergeant Roderica Simmons, representation is everything. Seeing it made a difference in her life, now she hopes to do the same for others. He’s a soldier that helps in many ways: serving our country, the medical field, his family and the community around him. Most days, you’ll find Specialist Tristan Garza in the Eisenhower Army Medical Center. A local. A Youth Challenge Academy graduate. Now, a soldier serving our country. This is the story of Specialist Billy Williams. This soldier has a big promotion waiting for him and he says he’s ready to dedicate the next decade of his military career to it. Meet Sergeant Brandon T. Jones. He’s a soldier committed to this country and saving the lives of those fighting for it. Staff Sergeant Sean Kelly serves as a combat medic at Fort Gordon. He says his faith and family inspire him to make a difference every day. He’s a soldier that won’t take no for an answer. His name: Mark Schmitt. He overcame health challenges and rose to the rank of Sergeant Major. A soldier says joining the army was not just a career path. It also meant doing something bigger for herself and her daughter. FOX54 salutes Private First Class Cynthia Serrano. Deputy Keli Parrish is a hero in our community. Now, our nation’s capitol recognizes her father as a hero too. When soldiers hear the term ""going to the field"", it usually means a training exercise in the woods. But for some lucky service members across the southeast, it meant training on the Carolina Panther\'s training camp field. USAA in partnership with the NFL Columbia County Sheriff\'s Office, Law enforcement, police, Burke County Sheriff\'s Deputy Chris Young always wanted to be a law enforcement professional. After serving in the Marines, Young joined the Richmond County Sheriff\'s office as a jailer, then a road deputy. Young eventually became a Waynesboro Police offi Burke County Sheriff, Back the Blue, Saluting Our Heroes Hannah Gay has over three years in law enforcement. Two of those years have been with the Burke County Sheriff\'s Department. As a child, most girls her age wanted to wear dresses and do girly things. ""All the other little girls wanted to e ballerinas,"" Ga'}]"
