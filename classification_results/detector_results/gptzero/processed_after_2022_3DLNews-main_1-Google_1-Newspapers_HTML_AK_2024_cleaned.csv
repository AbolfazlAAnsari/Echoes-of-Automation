High 74F. Winds ESE at 5 to 10 mph.. Mostly cloudy skies. Low 53F. Winds ENE at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:38 am Haley Lehman/News-Miner Rep. Sarah Vance (R-Homer), standing, addresses the House of Representatives regarding HB 129, which would bring changes to Alaska’s voter rolls. The House passed a bill Friday that would update how the Division of Elections maintains voter registration rolls. The bill, formally known as House Bill 129, passed the House 33-6, with Interior Reps. Ashley Carrick (D-Fairbanks), Maxine Dibert (D-Fairbanks), Mike Prax (R-North Pole), Will Stapp (R-Fairbanks) and Frank Tomaszewski (R-Fairbanks) voting in support of the bill. The bill would require the director of the Division of Elections to mail or email voters who have not voted and contacted the division within two years, or voters who have established a residence in another state, requesting that they confirm or correct their address. The voter’s registration will be deactivated within 45 days after the notice is sent if the voter does not respond. The division would also regularly review and update the master registry for data breaches, the number of registered voters compared to the number of people eligible to vote, names of deceased voters, people not qualified to vote, and people registered to vote in another state. The bill also requires the director of the Division of Elections to develop a process to allow a voter to cancel their registration in-person or online. The bill makes it easier for the state to remove inactive voters from the register. The federal National Voter Registration Act allows states to remove voters who have not voted in two consecutive federal general elections and did not respond to a notice from an elections office. States can also remove registered voters for death, felony conviction, moving to another state, or when a voter cancels their registration. As of Jan. 3, 602,514 people are registered to vote in Alaska, according to the Division of Elections, while the Department of Labor and Workforce Development estimates that there are 560,111 people in Alaska of voting age. In the Fairbanks North Star Borough, there are 77,262 registered voters. In the 2023 election, 20.12% of those voters cast their vote. Maintaining current and accurate voter rolls protects against fraud, informs Election Day planning, minimizes wait times at the polls, and reduces the number of provisional ballots cast, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Support Rep. Sarah Vance (R-Homer), the sponsor of the bill, said that the election bill intends to “restore the integrity of the process and ultimately build the public trust in one of our most fundamental rights: the right of the people to vote.” Vance said that voters have voiced their concerns with the election system. Other legislators expressed concerns that there are more people on the voter registration list than adults in Alaska. “The challenge facing the Division of Elections is to maintain current and accurate voter rolls is exacerbated by the transient population, automatic voter registration of the permanent fund dividend and a current law that allows people to stay registered in the state as long as they have an intent to return,” Vance told the House. “Over registering voters makes the election system inaccurate and vulnerable to actions of bad actors.” House Majority Leader, Rep. Dan Saddler (R-Eagle River), argued that the bill is a step forward in protecting election integrity. “We have to have accurate voter rolls so we can have accurate trust in our system and confidence in the results of the decisions we make,” Saddler said. “This bill goes a long way towards addressing the needs.” House Minority Leader, Rep. Calvin Schrage (NA-Anchorage), said that he has faith in Alaska’s elections. “I do find arguments persuasive that we have a very transient population and ... I think we want to make sure our voter rolls are as accurate as possible.” Stapp told the News-Miner that Fort Wainwright is a good example of an area with more people registered to vote than residing there due to the transient nature of the military. In the 2023 election, .56% of registered voters cast their vote, according to borough election results. Opposition Rep. Sara Hannan (D-Juneau) argued that the bill would exclude residents who are military service members, Peace Corps volunteers or missionaries who are abroad but are legal residents of the state. Rep. Alyse Galvin (NA-Anchorage) and Rep. Andy Josephson (D-Anchorage) voiced concern that the bill would create challenges for rural Alaskans and would disenfranchise voters. Legislation advances to the Senate Sen. Scott Kawasaki (D-Fairbanks) said that he is planning on hearing the bill in the Senate State Affairs Committee. Kawasaki said that he and Vance are working together on election-related legislation. “I think there are some concerns that it might kick people off the rolls too early,” he said, since the proposed law would send notices to voters who have not contacted the Division of Elections and voted in two years. “We want to make sure that really any Alaskan, whether they decide to vote one year or the next year, isn’t automatically kicked off without some sort of security,” he said. Sen. Bill Wielechowski (D-Anchorage) said that Senate Bill 138 has some similar provisions to HB 129, with a four-year timeline to inactivate voters instead of a two-year timeline. He said that the Senate has some concerns that voters would get removed from the rolls when they intended to vote. “I think there’s a bigger picture. I think we’re all concerned about voter integrity, but there’s other things to voter integrity than just knocking people off the rolls,” he said. Wielechowski added that he’d like to see a bill with provisions for same day voter registration and ballot curing, where a voter can fix an error on their ballot.

Please give us a call at 907-600-1691 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy As the Alaska Legislature convenes in Juneau, the state population is on the minds of lawmakers. For the 11th consecutive year, more people moved out of Alaska than moved into it, according to new estimates published this week by the Alaska Department of Labor. Though new births over the past year counterbalanced the losses, the state’s population growth was a meager 0.04%, demographers estimate. The state’s new estimated population, 736,812, is below what it was in 2012. While the trend has been building for more than a decade, the number of lawmakers calling for swift and major action has grown, and a variety of proposals are now circulating in the Capitol. “It’s just interesting this year how, regardless of whether it’s cost of living, energy costs, schools, everybody’s bringing up that population loss,” said Rep. Will Stapp, R-Fairbanks. But why now, after 11 years of losses? “I think it’s been finally recognized,” said Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage. “You know the old analogy: ‘How do you boil a frog?’ You turn up the heat slowly. And then finally, the frog realizes, ‘Oh, no, I’m cooked.’ I think that’s kind of what’s happened.” In the first three days of the legislative session, population loss has been referenced dozens of times, and the proposed solutions vary widely. Rep. George Rauscher, R-Sutton and a member of the House majority coalition, suggested that high electricity prices are contributing to a high cost of living, and Speaker of the House Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, said “the No. 1 priority here for our caucus will be to figure out how we reduce the cost of energy all across Alaska.” Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, said increased education funding is the No. 1 priority of the Senate’s bipartisan majority. More funding will result in better schools, he and others suggested. “We have put education at the very top,” he said. Members of the predominantly Democratic minority in the House have also called education funding part of the answer. “This is a crisis, an absolute crisis,” said House Minority Leader Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage. Giessel said the lack of a pension program for state employees is deterring people from moving to the state to take state jobs, and the revival of the pension is the majority’s No. 2 priority. She and others said they’re particularly alarmed by the decline in the state’s working-age population, the number of residents between 18 and 64 years old. That’s fallen from more than 480,000 in 2013 to about 450,000 today. “If we have aspirations to build an in-state gas pipeline, to amp up and modernize our transmission lines, to improve our education outcomes, it means that we need to have qualified workforce here,” Giessel said. “These are the folks that are leaving, that are being recruited to other states.” In a written message published on Monday, Gov. Mike Dunleavy said he intends to make affordability a major issue during the session by introducing a series of bills. “A major focus for this year’s legislative session is affordability. Alaska can be an expensive place to live, but we can also do something about it. Food and energy security, childcare, housing, access to land, and healthcare are the key areas we need to work on to make Alaska an even better place to live,” he said. Jeff Turner, the governor’s communications director, said that “the affordability push is to ultimately start growing Alaska’s population. The key is to make it an even better place to raise a family.” He said he expects that message to be included in next week’s State of the State address. Stapp, a member of the House majority, said that with so many ideas floating around, there’s a big unanswered question. “Everyone kind of agrees on the issue: We’re seeing outmigration in our state. We’re even going to agree on a lot of the reasons why that’s happening. So the problem is, when it comes to it, what are you going to do about it?” Log In Keep it Clean.

Please give us a call at 907-600-1691 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy The Alaska State Senate passed Senate Bill 88, sponsored by state Sen. Cathy Giessel (R-Anchorage), create a new “Defined Benefit” system for public employees and teacher retirement, providing an option for current employees to convert their “defined contribution” 401 K -type plan to the new pension retirement system. The legislation gained bipartisan support in the Senate with 10 additional co-sponsors in addition to Giessel as prime sponsor. It is now in the state House, which is led by Republicans. “This not your grandmother’s gold-plated retirement plan. This is a modest and reasonable retirement plan that will turn the tide on our workforce recruitment and retention issues,” Giessel said. “We must take significant action now if we want to turn around our economy and attract the brightest and best in all industries, public and private,” she said. The legislation was introduced last March and seeks to address the state’s workforce recruitment and retention issues. “Over the past 11 years, Alaska has seen an outmigration of its population, losing nearly 34,000, or 7%, of working-age Alaskans. Meanwhile, Alaska’s aging population has grown by 3%. These senior citizens are mostly retired and out of the workforce,” she said. The state administration, led by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, has been vacancies in state agencies climbed to 26%. “On top of that, municipalities are struggling to fill maintenance and operations, police and fire, and other positions to deliver essential services. One primary reason that has been cited for recruitment and retention issues is the lack of a quality retirement system that public servants can depend on once they retire,” Giessel said. Sen Click Bishop (R-Fairbanks), a cosponsor supports the bill: “A reliable and quality retirement package is crucial for attracting and retaining skilled individuals in Alaska. This is particularly important given the widespread labor shortages and 11 straight years of out-migration in our state,” Bishop said. “The demand for essential workers, such as nurses, police officers, firefighters, teachers, snow-plow drivers, heavy equipment operators, and ferry workers underscores the urgency of providing competitive retirement packages, said Bishop, who is a former state Commissioner of Labor. “Returning to a defined benefit system will serve as that vital incentive for retiring individuals to choose Alaska as their home,” he said. In 2006, the state of Alaska transitioned to a defined contribution plan, similar to a 401(k)-retirement plan, and it was believed that retirees would earn the same level of retirement as the prior Defined Benefits system, Giessel said. An initial analysis by the Division of Retirement and Benefits concluded that if a state worker who has spent 20 years under the defined contribution plan were to retire today, the employee would only receive 32% of their average earnings, compared to 40.3% under the prior defined benefits system – a difference of $8,000 a year. Even more so, a peace officer or firefighter would receive $16,000 less under the defined contribution plan after 20 years of service. Many components of this new defined benefits plan are similar to earlier, modified defined benefits retirement plans, the so-called Tier II and Tier III plans. “But, through analysis, revisions, and compromises, components o B 88 that caused concerns about past retirement systems are addressed,” Giessel said. “For example, this proposal increases the employee contribution rate from prior pension retirement systems and makes it adjustable so that employees share in the system’s financial solvency risk.

(Photo via Amazon) Hafner portrays the toll forced isolation can take on the human psyche within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic I’ve written before about how difficult it is for me to read novels in which the COVID-19 pandemic plays a central theme. The virus doesn’t feel far enough in the past to have already become a subgenre of historical fiction, and trying to stay focused on books about the pandemic often ends with me staring into space, lost in my own memories. When I started reading Katie Hafner’s “The Boys,” I didn’t know that it was about the COVID-19 pandemic. (Nor did I know I would contract COVID-19 a week later, but that’s beside the point.) The book lured me in with a bright pastel cover and a mysterious summary, and I took the bait. Hafner is a former staff writer at The New York Times, where she wrote about health care and technology for 10 years and is now a frequent contributor. “The Boys,” is her first novel, and it maybe makes sense that those topics are motifs throughout. “The Boys,” follows the reclusive Ethan Fawcett, who falls in love with outgoing Barb. As their relationship progresses, Ethan’s childhood trauma causes problems as they look to begin a family. It’s difficult to summarize the plot of “The Boys” without giving away some of the details or plot points that make it such a compelling read. Ethan and Barb are both lovable protagonists who feel so real, it’s like you’ve met them before. The love story is a charming tale of introvert-meets-extrovert, in which their differences complement each other and nurture their comfortable life founded on mutual respect. Underlying that story, though, is a darker tone stemming from Ethan’s loss of his parents as a child. The incident leaves him with a fear of parenthood that creates wrinkles in their marriage and prompts Barb to bring home two boys — yes, the boys — as a sort-of parenting trial run. Ethan’s bond with the boys is immediate and runs deep — deeper than Barb’s, in a way that drives the couple apart. What feels as true-to-life as the characters is the way Hafner portrays the toll forced isolation can take on the human psyche within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In my experience, stories about the COVID-19 pandemic play up the same themes and imagery associated with other depictions of pandemics in media: tired doctors, sick loved ones, global panic. All of those, of course, were elements of the COVID-19 pandemic. What resonated with me about “The Boys,” though, was Hafner’s depiction of how forced isolation — quarantine and social distancing — exacerbated Ethan’s already severe introversion. His character pushes the concept to its limit, pulling at the loose thread of the idea until the whole sweater has unraveled. His story is a sympathetic one. “The Boys” is a novel without an antagonist. As in life, it’s not always easy to identify what is driving the conflict; people have good days and bad days, and don’t always behave like you expect them to. “The Boys,” is not the first book to dramatize the COVID-19 pandemic, and it certainly won’t be the last. As authors duke it out for their own slice of that niche literary canon, I think “The Boys” will stand out as an eccentric and endearing story of human connection as essential “The Boys,” was published in 2022 by Spiegel & Grau.

from the NYPD’s Midtown South Precinct approached a group of men outside a migrant shelter on West 42nd Street near Seventh Avenue on Jan. 27, 2024, in New York. The officers were trying to break up the disorderly crowd, and when they attempted to put one of the men under arrest, multiple people attacked the officers. (NYPD/TNS) NEW YORK — The brazen attack on New York City Police Department officers by a group of migrants outside a Times Square shelter prompted an immediate — and strong — backlash. The attack became a lightning rod for criticism over the already-polarizing migrant crisis in New York City, with calls for the migrants involved to be deported. But the midtown brawl was the latest in a series of violent episodes linked to migrants, many unfolding against a backdrop of increasing frustration and despair. There have been knife fights, stabbings, tussles after NYPD moped confiscations, struggles over coats and food and a brawl after a man desperate for a shelter bed pushed into a migrant center. Migrants and those who are helping them make their way in New York City say no one should be surprised that tensions are reaching a breaking point. Struggles finding work on top of the Adams administration’s controversial shelter stay limit policy have created a dire, volatile reality. The tens of thousands of migrants spinning through the city’s shelter system are often driven to desperation as they are left to fight over scraps of food and clothing. “This is going to keep going, and worse situations are going to happen if we don’t treat people like human beings and don’t provide basic necessities for them,” said Mammad Mahmoodi, founder of EV Loves, a nonprofit that runs regular meal distributions at a migrant center in the East Village. Earlier this week, migrants milled outside the Midtown shelter, next door to Madame Tussauds, where the brawl erupted last week. The Candler building shelter was among the first that saw the issuance of 30-day notices. Migrants told the Daily News they’ve endured dangerous journeys to get to New York City. Most are fleeing gang violence, economic instability or political persecution. They can’t legally work and struggle to provide for themselves and their families. Plus, every 30 days, they’re required to vacate their shelters and are back on the streets as they wait for a new bed to open up. “There are fights almost daily,” said Darwin Tituana, from Ecuador. Tituana, 43, used to live at the shelter, but days ago, moved into a new shelter at JFK airport. His mail still gets delivered to the Candler building — one of the many bureaucratic challenges migrants face. “All the migrants, myself included, sometimes get desperate,” Tituana said. “Because you have nothing, you can’t pay for anything, you don’t get help… It became really hard when I started to understand what my situation was like. I’ve now accepted that I have to wait to do things right. But there are a lot of people I’ve seen who are desperate because they want to work, and they don’t understand the system.” The constant evictions and relocations required by Adam’s 30-day shelter stay limit for single adults, after which they must return to the East Village center, a former Catholic school, to reapply for shelter, make the environment even more fraught, Tituana said. Vitor Ramirez, 26, a migrant from Venezuela, said that, when he’s in between shelters, he doesn’t really sleep much at night for fear that others will steal from him. “You have to sleep like this,” he said, mimicking resting his head on a pillow with one eye open. “Because if you close your eyes, you’ll never see your phone again.” Jonathan Gomez, 26, also from Venezuela, said his hopes for a brighter future in New York have slowly declined since he arrived six months ago. When Gomez arrived in the city, he felt good. He was grateful for the services the city provided. But gradually, with every time he’s been booted from a shelter and is forced to spend nights sleeping on floors and trains with all his belongings in tow, he’s lost a bit of hope. “[My mood] goes up a little bit, but then it falls three times as much,” he said. “And every time, it feels a little bit worse than before.” Chaotic scenes have flared up at an East Village migrant center, where long lines of migrants regularly stretch around blocks as they wait for a new shelter bed. More fights bubbled up on recent freezing cold days when around 1,000 migrants waited outside in the cold. On Jan. 6, the crowd outside the reticketing center got rowdy and the NYPD was called. Officers attempted to control the crowd when Angel Gutierrez Medal, 24, allegedly assaulted them, according to cops. He was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest. The two cops suffered minor injuries. Two days before that, on Jan. 4, Abdellahi Mohammed, 25, tried to cut the line to get into the building, said the NYPD. Two hired security guards confronted the man, who pushed and punched them. Mohammed had given his home address as the relocation center. “My point of view is that when the resources are scarce, and people are in survival, you know, they just resort to their instinctive behaviors,” Mahmoodi of EV Loves said. Also earlier this month, a man was stabbed in the back with a screwdriver and fights broke out as migrants waited on line for food or shelter, according to police. A fight broke out at a shelter last fall when cops confiscated mopeds. “Fights broke out — real, bad fights broke out — over a few coats, because people had just arrived from warm environments, and they were incredibly cold,” Mahmoodi added. “They were freezing. They’re nearly going into hypothermia. That coat is what puts them [over], that’s their survival instinct.” A migrant outside the East Village site, Said, 27, from Honduras, said he’s been waiting for shelter for about two weeks. “Thank god, there haven’t been any problems lately,” he said. He spends the nights sleeping at a nearby church. “Sometimes I go somewhere else because I don’t like to just hang out here for hours, but I don’t really have anywhere to go. Since I’m on my own, sometimes I just wander around. I go to the screens on 42nd St., where they call it Times Square.” Assemblymember Harvey Epstein, whose office is located directly across the street from the reticketing site, said that the shelter stay limits and migrants’ inability to get legal work are a big reason for chaotic scenes outside migrant shelters.

Shelley Hughes would require Alaska school districts to train a volunteer able to carry a concealed handgun on school grounds. Schools would be exempted only if no one agrees to accept the duty or if no one is able to do so. Hughes’ proposal, Senate Bill 173, received its first hearing last week in the Senate Labor and Commerce Committee. The K-12 School Shooting Database includes 346 shootings and near-shootings at schools or school buses in the United States in 2023. Hughes said many of Alaska’s schools are rural, remote, and away from law enforcement. “There have been times when it can take — because of weather — three to five days to get to a remote village that doesn’t have any kind of law enforcement present, that are armed. So SB 173 is a needed stopgap,” she said. Front-end interventions, such as mental health treatment and resources to help students, are still needed, she said, but if the worst happens, she said she wants help nearby. No public testimony was taken during last week’s meeting, but letters sent to the committee overwhelmingly opposed Hughes’ bill. Of 51 letters received through noon Jan. 24, only two were supportive. Dr. Charles Ross Baldwin, a trauma surgeon in Anchorage, was one of those who wrote in opposition. “As a trauma surgeon, I see a large number of self-inflicted and accidental gun-related injuries. While there are a lot of emotions around protecting children, the reality of putting guns in schools, in the hands of inadequately trained civilians, would likely increase risk of harm to students more than it would help prevent violence,” he said. April Rochford of Anchorage said in her testimony that it doesn’t make sense, at a time when school districts are pleading for more funding, to require them to pay for the training. “This bill is … frankly, quite stupid,” she said, adding that if legislators were serious about reducing gun violence, they would consider a safe-storage bill (House Bill 164) and one about extreme-risk protective orders (House Bill 162). Hughes’ proposal is similar to one introduced in the Utah Legislature in November. Current state law prohibits someone from carrying a deadly weapon on school grounds without the permission of the chief administrative officer of the school or district. Larger schools and those in urban areas frequently have armed “school resource officers” permitted by the district, and Hughes said SB 173 would be an extension of that effort. Under the language of the bill, school districts would have to create written policies and procedures for the armed volunteer, and they could limit the role to a school district employee, but that isn’t required. If the volunteer is an employee, the district would have to pay for any mandated training. If the volunteer isn’t an employee, the district would be required to reimburse them for their costs, if they ask for reimbursement. Districts would have to provide local and state police departments with active-shooter plans annually, and those plans would have to include the assigned location of any volunteer armed guards. The bill also includes a liability shield if someone is harmed by a volunteer guard’s “act or failure to act during a crisis.” The shield doesn’t apply in cases of gross negligence. The bill doesn’t mandate a specific number of hours of training but references a national standard for school resource officers. “The initial training would be a four-day training,” Hughes said, “and then you can have drills and additional training on top of that. That would be the bare minimum required.” State agencies said there would be no cost to them, but Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, said that doesn’t mean it will be free. “This will not be zero cost for our school districts,” he said. Hughes said she believes legislators will have regrets if they fail to pass the bill and there’s a fatal shooting in Alaska. “If we wait until after children have died, after school staff have died, not only would that be a dreadful shame, an inexcusable mistake, but it would be a travesty,” she said.––––––––––––––https://alaskabeacon.com/james-brooks User Name Password Remember Me 20 YEARS AGO May 2004 Photo caption: Katlian’s helmet and blacksmith hammer that he used in the 1804 battle at Indian River are carried from the Sheldon Jackson Museum to Sitka National Historical Park, where they will be exhibited as part of the commemoration of the conflict.

The office of the governor declined a request for an interview seeking an explanation for the orders and how they came about. In a prepared written statement, Dunleavy communications director Jeff Turner said, “One of Governor Dunleavy’s priorities is to make state government as efficient and effective as possible. Several executive orders transfer functions from boards and commissions to the relevant state department, which is in the best interest of efficient administration.” The 12 orders No. 124 -The commissioner of fish and game has the authority to prohibit by regulation the live capture, possession, transport, or release of native or exotic game or their eggs.

While executive orders can be far-reaching — Dunleavy used one to split the Department of Health and Social Services into two agencies in 2022 — they’re often obscure, even for people familiar with the workings of state government. Executive order No. 4, for example, has been lost and no copy exists, legislative records state. Traditionally, governors have preferred to pass bills through the Legislature instead of using executive orders. But the large number of orders this year may be connected to the state’s current political environment: With control of the Alaska Legislature divided and unlikely to pass more than a few dozen pieces of legislation, executive orders are a way for the governor to advance his priorities. Professional licensing practices have frequently been criticized for limiting competition and blocking the development of new businesses, and eliminating them would be in line with the governor’s stated goals of growing Alaska’s economy. That approach doesn’t come without controversy. “It just doesn’t feel like it’s a well thought-out plan,” said Bethel Belisle, a member of the Board of Certified Direct-Entry Midwives. While there are only about 40 licensed direct-entry midwives in the state, they delivered about 6% of Alaska’s newborns in 2022, according to the state’s annual vital statistics report.

Game made the case to the Nome Common Council during a work session on Monday to remove weapon restrictions for musk ox hunting in the Inner Nome Area. ADF&G Area Biologist Sara Henslee explained that current regulations only allow the use of shotgun, muzzleloader or bow and arrow for the Inner Nome Area, which is extending outside of the city limits to Basin Creek in the north, the backside of Army Peak in the east and just past Sunset Creek in the west. The reason given for the change was that shotgun slugs are incredibly inefficient and don’t provide a clean, fast and humane death to the musk ox. The slugs get stuck in the animals’ thick coat and their thick hide, not allowing for a fast and clean kill. Charlie Lean, chair of the Fish and Game advisory panel, attested to the inefficiency, saying hunters have to hit the animals multiple times, prolonging the animal’s suffering whereas one clean shot with a rifle would avoid those gruesome scenarios. “It’s one shot versus cowboying around a musk ox and shoot it until it falls over,” he said. Lean explained also that hunters that qualify for a Tier 2 permit are experienced, older and seasoned hunters with good judgement. “I don’t know any hunter who would want to shoot a musk ox in close proximity to a home, I don’t see that as a likely scenario,” he said. “The hunt is skewed to older, seasoned hunters who know how to place a shot.” Lean added that there is a safety concern. To kill a musk ox with a shotgun, one has to get within a 10 to 50-yard range. Given that even a well-placed shot won’t immediately kill the animal, it is a safety concern as the wounded animal or others in the group could charge. A clean rifle shot could be taken from a 100-yard range. The reason for the restriction in the first place was to avoid rifles being used in residential areas as oftentimes musk oxen found inside city limits in the summer and fall. “We see musk oxen in residential areas and the risk of using high-powered rifles was a concern,” Henslee explained. Also the risk of hitting unintended targets when trying to shot a ‘sky-lined’ animal was a concern. Since musk oxen are herd animals and usually stick together in congregations, the rifle restriction was also in place to avoid through-shots that may injure a second animal. However, Henslee said, since 2012 that the Tier 2 hunt has been around with the weapon restrictions in place, most harvested musk oxen are not taken in the city of Nome proper, but outside the city limits. The timing is such that hunters prefer to take musk oxen in the winter, when the animals have retreated to the hills, their coat is lush, the qiviut is thick, the meat is not stinky from the rut and clean butchering on snow is possible. Most musk oxen taken in the summer or fall when the animals congregate in town, are dispatched not as part of the Tier 2 hunt, but in defense of life and property. Henslee said over an eleven-year period, only seven percent, or five animals of 76 harvested musk oxen taken in the fall. She said only rarely does a hunter use bow and arrow, and she wasn’t aware of anyone using a muzzleloader. ADF&G’s Alicia Carson added that it is permissible to use a rifle hunting moose or bear in the Inner Nome Area. Ethan Kelso also stepped up to the podium, saying that he had hunted musk oxen since he was seven years old and that he is a firearms instructor, attesting to the inefficiency of shotguns. Musk oxen are herd animals, he said. Once one is shot, they tend to bunch up and rub the blood of the wounded animals on them, making it impossible to find out which one has been shot. “You have no idea which animal you shot and you wait around while the animal is suffering,” he said. “One of the central rules is ‘Know your target and what’s behind it.’ I would strongly support rifles.” Henslee said that those hunters applying for the Tier 2 permit will be required to have a Hunter Education certificate and will require a one-on-one musk ox hunter orientation course completion. The department plans to remove the weapons restriction for the TX095 Inner Nome Area hunt beginning August 1, 2024.

a series of especially warm years. That was one takeaway from the 2023 Eastern Bering Sea Ecosystem Status Report, which was presented in a Strait Science lecture last week. Elizabeth Siddon, who is the Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management lead at NOAA’s Auke Bay Labs in Juneau, discussed the results. These annual reports are intended to look at the overall health of the region’s marine ecosystem and to influence the decisions of the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council. The Bering Sea in 2023 was cool compared to recent warm years, but it is still warmer than the average temperature of the last 40 years. The sea ice also had a late start in forming last winter, which has been a common feature as the Arctic warms. However, last year’s ice came about a month later than the ice formed a year earlier. Siddon said this could be partially attributed to Typhoon Merbok which brought early fall warmth to the region and stirred up the water column. Siddon explained that scientists are interested in looking at sea ice presence because “it changes the vertical structure of the water column.” For example, as sea ice is forming, salts are being extruded from the ice and increasing in salinity of the water. “At the southern extent in the spring, when that ice melts, it’s fresh water that is released into the surface waters, and this in a local sense decreases salinity,” Siddon said. Changing levels of salinity can change the habitats of fish and phytoplankton. Sea ice also determines the extent of cold water at the seafloor, which acts like an environmental barrier that keeps some species like pollock out. “What we call the ‘cold pool’ is sort of a footprint of where sea ice was the previous winter,” Siddon said. The cold pool nearly disappeared amid marine heatwaves in 2018 and 2019. But researchers conducting the bottom trawl survey for NOAA over the last few years have documented its return. The ecosystem report was split between the Northern Bering Sea—which includes Norton Sound and goes from 60 degrees north latitude to the Bering Strait—and the Southeastern Bering Sea, which covers the area down to the Aleutians. In the Southeastern portion, the algae, phytoplankton and other organisms at the bottom of the food chain continued their trend of long-term decline, Siddon said. At the next level of the food chain, zooplankton like krill were found in low to moderate abundance. Pelagic fish found in the water column were in mixed health, but overall, many species seemed to be in bad shape. For example, the condition of young pollock has been below average since this period of especially warm years began in 2014. “Even though it cooled for 2022 and 2023, we haven’t seen the fish condition come back like we would think under cooler conditions,” Siddon said. Juvenile salmon across all species have also been in below-average body condition over the southern continental shelf. Still, there were some higher-than-average metrics of ecosystem health. For example, sockeye salmon have had high returns for Bristol Bay since 2015. These same ecosystem health indicators were also down overall for the Northern Bering Sea, but the region seemed to bounce back better from those warm years than the Southeastern Bering Sea, Siddon said. “The Northern Bering Sea has also cooled and it seems like some of the biological things—the zooplankton and the fish condition—have done better or maybe rebounded faster than the southern Bering Sea for the kinds of time series that we had to look at,” she said. While the abundance and quality of organisms at the base of the food web was also low in the Northern Bering Sea, the region saw a boost in zooplankton abundance. And while salmon runs have been down across the region, the condition of juvenile salmon of all four species was positive in 2022; in 2023, there were some slight improvements in the indicators for Chinook and chum salmon, according to the report. Another part of the report mixed observations from Indigenous experts and scientists on the recent Western Alaska salmon crashes. “The idea was to look at 2023 and try to explain why we are seeing these big really collapses of salmon runs in the Yukon and Kuskokwim when Bristol Bay sockeye has been doing so well,” Siddon said. Using data from the previous 15 years, scientists had observed that 2019, the year with the warmest water, the marine juvenile salmon they sampled had the lowest stomach fullness. “These fish are not finding a lot to eat in 2019,” Siddon said. Western science offered one explanation for the poor salmon returns, but members of the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission encouraged fisheries managers to look at the bigger picture. A quote from one of their members was included in the report: “There’s the climate change part, there’s bycatch and things like that. And then not only the ocean life, but also what’s happening in our spawning rivers. The health of those because of climate change; too much snow, not enough snow, too cold, too warm. How different everything is changing. I think there’s a lot of things that come into play.” Siddon and her colleagues will be looking at data collected throughout the year for their 2024 report. Amid an El Niño year, some researchers were concerned that the Bering Sea region would see warmer conditions that would delay sea ice formation. In early December, the ice was still scant in the Bering Strait. “December cooled off, winds came from the north, sea ice was able to form,” Siddon said. “But the thickness of it was pretty thin and sort of vulnerable to changes in the winds.” Ice concentration maps from Jan. 16 showed that there were still areas of open water and low ice concentration in parts of the Bering Strait region, such as in Norton Sound.In early December, the ice was still scant in the Bering Strait.
