news delivered to your inbox! One of the 10 Republicans who signed an official-looking certificate falsely claiming Donald Trump won the 2020 Wisconsin presidential election said on CBS’ “60 Minutes” that he did so out of fear. Former Wisconsin Republican Party chair Andrew Hitt told Anderson Cooper that had he not signed the document and a court ruled that the former president won Wisconsin, he feared he would have been the sole reason Republicans wouldn’t have had the paperwork to deliver his win. “Can you imagine the repercussions on myself, my family, if it was me, Andrew Hitt, who prevented Donald Trump from winning Wisconsin?” Hitt told Anderson Cooper on a “60 Minutes” episode that aired Sunday. “It was not a safe time,” he said. “If my lawyer is right, and the whole reason Trump loses Wisconsin is because of me, I would be scared to death.” Hitt said he now feels terrible about the fraudulent scheme, and that he was tricked into participating in it. The slate of Republican electors gathered at the state Capitol on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign documents declaring Trump the winner on the same day Democratic electors cast the state’s actual Electoral College votes for Joe Biden. Documents have underscored efforts by those in Trump’s inner circle to circumvent the Electoral College process in several states, including Wisconsin, after the 2020 election, despite recounts and court decisions affirming that Biden defeated Trump in the battleground state by almost 21,000 votes. Hitt and the nine other Republican electors settled a civil lawsuit in December regarding the scheme. As part of the settlement they acknowledged President Joe Biden won the election and admitted their actions furthered a scheme to illegally overturn the election. As the 2024 presidential election kicks off, Hitt said he didn’t think Trump would be a good president for the country. “We need a leader who ... tackles serious problems and serious issues that this country faces,” he said on “60 Minutes.” “And we need faith in our institutions again. And the next president of the United States needs to do that.” Asked whether that person could be Trump, Hitt said, “That is not him.” While a handful of voters in 2020 risked going to prison by attempting to vote twice or in the name of a dead relative, as happens in any election, no evidence of widespread fraud has ever been produced in Wisconsin or elsewhere. Yet, many continue to question some of the practices clerks relied on to encourage eligible voters to cast ballots and make sure their votes were counted amid the first election in more than 100 years held during a pandemic. Here\'s what happened, and didn\'t happen. The state has multiple, overlapping safeguards aimed at preventing ineligible voters from casting ballots, tampering with the ballots or altering vote totals.
