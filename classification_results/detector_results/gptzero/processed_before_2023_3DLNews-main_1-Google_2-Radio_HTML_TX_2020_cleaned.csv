The bill is named for Jenna Quinn, a Texan and child abuse survivor, and is modeled after successful reforms passed in Texas. The Jenna Quinn Law would authorize federal grants to eligible entities for increasing evidence-based or informed training on sexual abuse prevention education and reporting to teachers and school employees, students, caregivers, and other adults who work with children. “The success of Jenna’s Law in Texas has shown that training teachers, caregivers, and students on how to recognize and report child sexual abuse saves lives, but many states do not have programs like this in place,” Senator Cornyn said. “I’m proud to bring the Jenna Quinn Law to the national level and urge my colleagues in the House to quickly pass it to protect the lives of vulnerable children.” Senator Cornyn (R-TX) and Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) are behind the bi-partisan legislation. “Every child has the fundamental right to be safe, to be treated with dignity, to be cared for, and to have the opportunity to seize their vast potential. Sexual abuse robs children of those rights,” Sen. Hassan said. “During my time as Governor of New Hampshire, I worked across the aisle to sign into law a bill that mandated that child abuse prevention be taught as part of the health education curriculum. I am proud to have worked with Senator Cornyn to strengthen these efforts on a national level by passing the Jenna Quinn Law through the Senate, and I urge my colleagues in the House to pass this important bipartisan bill without delay.” Jenna Quinn has been an outspoken advocate for survivors of child sexual abuse and was the driving force behind what is now known as Jenna’s Law in Texas. Unanimously passed by the Texas State Senate and House, Jenna’s Law was the first child sexual abuse prevention law in the U.S. that mandates K-12 training for students and school staff and was amended in 2017 to include sex trafficking prevention education in schools. More than half of all states have adopted a form of Jenna’s Law. After Jenna’s Law passed in Texas in 2009, a study found educators reported child sexual abuse at a rate almost four times greater after training than during their pre-training career.

Additionally, the cast features Aldis Hodge as Hawkman and Noah Centineo as Atom Smasher. Sarah Shahi has also been cast in an unannounced role. The project will be directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, who recently worked with Johnson on Disney's upcoming movie Jungle Cruise. Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvani penned the latest draft of the script. In the DC Comics, Cyclone is the superhero name of Maxine Hunkell, granddaughter of the 1940s heroine Red Tornado.

As a junior member of the JSA, Cyclone's powers include harnessing wind and generating sound. Swindell identifies as non-binary and uses them/they pronouns. Along with starring in Trinkets, they have appeared in HBO’s smash hit series Euphoria and will be seen in Neil Burger's Voyagers opposite Colin Farrell and Tye Sheridan next year. Black Adam has seen its share of delays this year due to Covid-19. Warner Bros. had the film slated for December 22, 2021, but that date is no longer set in stone.
