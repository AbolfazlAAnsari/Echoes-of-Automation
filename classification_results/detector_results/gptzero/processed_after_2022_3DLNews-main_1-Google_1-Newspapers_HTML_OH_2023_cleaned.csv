Supreme Court asked to weigh if punishment is \'cruel and unusual\' The nation\'s unhoused population increased so sharply because people are becoming unhoused at a greater rate than people exit homelessness, HUD officials said Friday. In recent years, homeless services providers have been particularly strained, according to Oliva, because more people need help, and at the same time it has been harder to get people housed because housing costs have increased. ""The cost of rent is outpacing our ability to get folks housed,"" she said. High housing costs continue to be a financial stressor for the poorest Americans. In recent years, more people in the U.S. are rent-burdened, according to HUD, meaning they spend more than 30% or even over 50% of their income on rent. In 2021 and 2022, as millions of Americans struggled with high rents, increasing grocery bills and other essential expenses, pandemic-era government financial assistance waned or ended, Oliva said. ""There\'s a pipeline of people who are deeply at risk,"" she said. Evictions nationwide have been steadily increasing since fall 2021, when the national eviction moratorium ended, according to Princeton University\'s Eviction Lab. In late 2022, emergency rental assistance from the federal government also stopped. From 2020 to 2022, the number of people who became homeless for the first time increased by 30%, according to HUD data. Even as more people became homeless and it became harder to house them, homeless services providers across the country helped more than 420,000 people in the U.S. exit or avoid homelessness, HUD announced this month. In a statement Friday, U.S. Interagency Council on Homeless Executive Director Jeff Olivet said pandemic-era protections prevented even more people from falling into homelessness in 2021 and 2022. ""During the height of the pandemic, the nation came together and chose to invest more in housing, health care, income supports, and other wraparound services to prevent people from losing their homes in the first place,"" he said. In contrast to recent years, 2023 saw increases among homeless families with children, veterans and unaccompanied young people, HUD officials said Friday. Across the country, elected officials and nonprofits in some cities have reduced homelessness by working with landlords and helping people remain in their homes. Houston saw a 17% drop in street homelessness, after more than 4,500 residents were moved from the street to housing or prevented from becoming homeless, the mayor\'s office says. In Philadelphia, the city\'s eviction diversion program helped a majority of participating landlords and tenants avoid evictions, by mediating any landlord-tenant disputes without taking cases to court. This year, Chattanooga, Tennessee, saw more than a 30% drop in unsheltered homelessness after officials used American Rescue Plan money to pay people\'s rents and axed a lottery process the county had used for housing vouchers. The city also worked directly with landlords to prevent evictions and keep people housed. Local providers put in the hard work and saw positive results, Oliva said, and ""their housing market is not quite as tight as as what you see on the coasts and in some other big cities,"" she said.'}]"

The city’s administration presented its appropriations and expenditures budget for 2024. The estimated revenue for next year is $97.4 million. The majority of that comes from income taxes, which is expected to bring in $45 million. According to the legislation, $65 million has been requested from the city’s general fund. Safety services take up a large chunk of that funding with the police department requesting $13.5 million. The budget says that in 2024, the Grove City Division of Police will have 75 full-time employees and 10 part-time employees. Personnel costs have increased over $350,000 due to annual increases, increased overtime costs, and the addition of one officer. According to Grove City Safety Director Kevin Teaford, the division of police has asked for the city to fund 50 police officer positions: one more than last year. He said he looked at calls for service and response times and determined that the city needs more officers in the field. Teaford said the division does not just want officers responding to calls for service. “About 40 to 45 percent of the time, we want our police officers doing crime prevention efforts,” said the safety director. Teaford also said the division wants to be “heavy on field service officers and light on administrators.” The division accomplishes this by placing civilians in administration roles instead of using officers. Keeping staff has been a challenge. According to Teaford, the police department will be losing two officers to retirement in the coming months. However, he explained that there is a training class in progress so after that training period, the division will have 43 officers. “We are currently in the process of recruiting, and we are getting good quality applicants,” said Teaford. The safety director said they are hoping to hire seven more officers to reach their goal of 50. He also said they are looking at ways to retain good employees. “We need to take care of our people,” he said. The budget for the police and emergency communications department has also increased for 2024. That department is seeking $2.7 million to fund its 18 employees as well as increased costs due to pay raises and overtime. The communications department will also need an extra $231,000 for costs association with a new radio system. In addition to safety services, the city is planning to spend nearly $23 million in capital improvements, which include (to name a few) $3 million for the annual street program, $2.5 million for improvements at Fryer Park, $1.3 million for a parking lot expansion at Windsor Park, $1.4 million for field reconfiguration at Windsor Park, and $1 million for roadway improvements along Broadway, Stringtown, Hoover, and Holt roads. According to the legislation, the Grove City Area Convention and Visitors Bureau will receive $414,000, Grove City Town Center Inc. will receive $78,000, the Grove City Chamber of Commerce will receive $74,000, and Little Theatre Off Broadway will get $9,000 through the convention bureau appropriation. In addition, the city plans to spend $659,364 on community development projects. This includes spending $45,000 on marketing events such as Arts in the Alley and the Bourbon and Spirits event. An additional $45,000 is expected to be used to market other city and Town Center events. It is expected to cost the city $85,000 for the 4th of July Celebration. According to Grove City Mayor Richard “Ike” Stage, the overall general fund appropriation request of $65 million is $12.8 million more than the 2023 appropriations. Operating expenses have increased by more than 8 percent and capital improvements are up in 2024. Last year, the capital improvements budget was $13.5 million. The estimated 2024 revenue projections and suggested appropriations will produce an end of year estimated unencumbered balance of $12.4 million.

Last school year, 28% of those state’s students were chronically absent, down from 30% the year prior. “An unprecedented wave of chronic absenteeism has spread across the country,” the analysis notes. “Not only is teaching and learning more challenging when large numbers of students are frequently missing class, such elevated levels of chronic absence can easily overwhelm a school’s capacity to respond.” Kids who are chronically absent have lower odds of graduating and, especially when they miss school in the early grades, of learning how to read. And while chronic absence generally is more common at the high school level, the latest report shows the increases were especially pronounced at elementary schools. The rate jumped from 7% in 2017-18 to 38% in 2021-22. In fact, the number of elementary schools with extreme levels of chronic absence – more than 30% of kids missing 10% of the year – far exceeded that of high schools. Which kids missed class during COVID? We asked, and shools don’t know.'}]"

In the world of Richland County sports, it was one that I am not sure we have ever seen before. So, I had to take a day and go back through all of the amazing clippings just to try and make sense of it all. Let's take a look back at the 15 biggest headlines of 2023 as we usher in a new year with hopefully just as much success. MOST READ STORY OF 2023: Jake's Take | An open letter to 'those' parents of high school athletes We start our trip down the 2023 memory lane with the sad news first. We lost a trio of instrumental individuals in the high school sports world. First, my good friend Bob Fisher, a long-time correspondent for the Mansfield News Journal, passed away in January and is missed to this day. Fisher wrote for the News Journal when I was in school and was the reason I applied for the NJ's sports reporter opening back in 2017. Then, we lost the legendary Bob Haas in April and while Bob isn't a Richland County product, he was born in Crawford County and made his legendary status at Huron County's Willard High School, he was still influential to so many in the high school sports world. And finally, we lost a Shelby sports legend in Bill Varble who put Shelby athletics on the map with his coaching style leading the football team to glory and influincing a future generation of Whippets. Varble was one of two Shelby icons to pass in 2023 as Grant Milliron died in July. Milliron may not have an athletic background, but he was instrumental in helping Madison put together the funds for synthetic turf on the football field as well as helping Shelby fund its beautiful Whippet Athletic Complex complete with football, baseball and softball turf. The All-Time Hit King Pete Rose made a visit to Mansfield as part of the Ontario Baseball Fundraiser in November. Rose spoke in front of a crowd at Westbrook Country Club fielding questions and sharing laughs with stories from all throughout his playing days. It was a great event that lasted well into the night as it also honored the state runner-up Ontario baseball team, which we will visit here in a little bit. Listening to Rose speak was fun and refreshing to see someone who was real. Who didn't care about what other people thought. Who was willing to look Cancel Culture in the eye and give it a middle finger. Just what we expect from Pete Rose. Madison grad Taylor Huff put together the greatest high school career of anyone to ever grace Richland County. A four-time All-American in high school, Huff continued her legacy by winning an NCAA National Championship with Florida State a year after transferring from the University of Tennessee where a national title validated every decision she made. Jon Spencer turned into an absolute machine in July for the 90th annual News Journal Tennis Tournament. He wrote story after story commemorating every single second of the historic tournament. It was amazing to see how the tournament shaped Ohio State University coach Melissa Schaub into the tennis nut she is today, how Jay Harris and Will Calhoun, the nation's No. 1 tennis doubles team in their age bracket, took pride in coming back for the event as part of alumni from five different states to come back, how Philip Etzel won a nail-biter in the 14-U group and see how the future of the tournament is as bright as the last 90 years. It was fun to see Terry Brown and Nicky Wong take a trip down memory lane as they competed for another NJ Tennis Tounrmanet title, Tammy (Schmidt) Simone and Katie (McCumiskey) Orlando turn their rivalry into a sisterhood all because of the tournament and cousins Ty Schaub and Jon Peters team up to win the doubles crown over Harris and Calhoun. Harris may have lost the doubles crown, but he and sister Nickie (Harris) Gibbs won the mixed doubles bracket while current Lex tennis players Ethan Remy won the 18U single bracket and Dylan Catanese won the 16U singles bracket to cap off a special weekend for all, one that was certainly a highlight of 2023. In March, the News Journal All-Star Classic was one that will be remembered for a very long time. For starters, it raised $11,253.70 for Catalyst Life Services Child and Adolescent Mental Health and Crisis Services Department and that is a testament to this great community and the support for this game over the last four and a half decades. But the game itself was outstanding. The first pick in the News Journal All-Star Classic draft, Jayden Jeffries, earned MVP honors after scoring 29 points and adding six rebounds, five assists and two steals as his North team destroyed the South 150-120 to tie the record for most points scored in the game by a single team and the record for the largest deficit in the game's history. The game also featured what is believed to be the first backflip ever pulled off when Chunky Haney released a 3-pointer and flipped as the ball swished through the net. It was just one of many highlights of the game. But the deeper stories of the kids stood out from all of the family ties to the game to the North and South coaches sharing a very close bond, pretty much like family. And even during the All-Star Classic banquet when Army Green Beret, NJ Classic Alum and current Clear Fork girls basketball coach Scott Sellers delivered an inspirational speech that will hopefully stick with the athletes for years to come. The NJ Classic is and will always be the highlight of my year. Now on to some high school sports highlights for 2023. It was a year of championships for Richland County schools as 38 league championships made their way into trophy cases. Here is who all won league titles: Winter: Lexington boys basketball, Crestview boys basketball, Shelby boys basketball, Lucas boys basketball, Mansfield Senior girls basketball, Shelby girls basketball, Clear Fork wrestling, Shelby girls swimming and Ontario boys swimming. Spring: Madison girls softball, Ontario softball, Crestview baseball, Lucas baseball, Lexington girls track, Shelby boys track, Shelby girls track, Crestview boys track, Lucas boys track, Lexington boys tennis and Ontario boys tennis. Fall: Mansfield Senior football, Ontario football, Shelby football, Lexington boys soccer, Madison girls soccer, Ontario girls soccer, Ontario boys soccer, Mansfield Christian boys soccer, Lexington boys cross country, Lexington girls cross country, Shelby boys cross country, Shelby girls cross country, Crestview girls cross country, Lexington girls golf, Shelby boys golf, Crestview boys golf, Mansfield Christian volleyball and Shelby girls tennis. It was a great year down in Columbus for Richland County wrestlers. In all, 11 wrestlers earned medals with many of them earning All-Ohio honors. Madison Hunter Hutcheson had a stellar ending to his high school career with his second All-Ohio finish while Leo Hess and Mekhi Bradley of Mansfield Senior built a brotherhood that will last a lifetime. Ontario’s Jacob and Aiden Ohl and Crestview’s Caleb Cunningham and Hayden Kuhn and Clear Fork's Luke Schlosser learned what it was like to battle through adversity and come out with much-deserved honors. The state cross country meet is always peppered with Richland County flavor and 2023 was no different. Lexington’s Brailey Slone, Elyana Weaver and Chance Basilone brought home All-Ohio honors while Lady Lex took third place as a team. It was a great year for cross country as two teams and five individuals made the trip to Fortress Obetz and represented Richland County very well. Track is quickly becoming the most successful sport in Richland County and 2023 was a major step toward making that statement true. After the first day of the state track meet, Richland County had nine All-Ohio athletes. By the end of the weekend, the headlines were aplenty with field athletes, relay teams and individual runners earning the sport’s highest honors. None were bigger than Joe Stupka’s three-event podium finishes. Well, maybe there were a couple, but we will check those out a little later. The year 2023 will go down as one where a lot of records fell and many milestones were met. It started in the late winter months when Shelby's Alex Bruskotter became just the sixth Whippet boys basketball player to join the 1,000-point club in a sectional championship win over Ontario. We also saw the Lucas boys basketball team send off the winningest class in program history with 85 victories in four years after a district semifinal loss and saw Clear Fork's Annika Labaki catch the single-season 3-pointers record in a sectional semifinal win over Edison. We will hear more from her later. The Mansfield Christian Flames also made some program history with their first sectional championship in nearly two decades with a""}]"

counting down the Top 10 local stories of the year, based on readers\' interest and staff input. Today we end the countdown with a look at the top two stories of 2023. Turnout was high in Sandusky County: 51% in off-year election In an election with high turnout, 51.32% of registered voters casting a ballot, many candidates had no challengers, and some positions had no one running at all, but the Fremont school board election stood out with six candidates running for three seats. The proposed Fremont City municipal income tax dedicated to road improvement failed Tuesday, with 1,879 (45.95%) voting for the tax and 2,210 (54.05%) against. Mayor Danny Sanchez, who ran unopposed and was reelected to his third term Tuesday, had campaigned hard for the roads proposal, but it was defeated for the third time. Tuesday\'s proposed income tax had been lowered to 0.25% after earlier efforts were rejected by voters on the fall and spring ballots of 2022. The school board race also had the largest number of possible voters, with 19,234 votes cast, of the possible 29,334. Sarah Lewis had the most votes, with 3,996 (20.78%). While she is an incumbent, this is her first election, after being appointed in August 2022. Several things stood out to her during this first race. “I think that the voters understand from the things that I’ve said, and how I’ve carried myself as an existing board member, that I’m truly invested in the children and truly invested in our community,” Lewis said. “Those are the only two reasons I wanted to be on the board, just to give back to the community that raised me and to advocate for the children.” She hopes to continue to work with the board members, which she feels they have done well at working together while thoughtfully listening to each other’s viewpoints. “I hope to do what we’ve been doing, which is to ensure that the kids in our school district have as many opportunities in the education for success, and we can,” Lewis said. “I attended a candidates night, sponsored by the NAACP, and it was my first opportunity to hear from each of the other candidates, live. After that I thought that the community had such a hard decision to make, because everyone running for the school board was running for all the right reasons and is well qualified to do the job.” Don Nalley Jr., who took 3,768 votes (19.59%), the second largest number, agreed with Lewis. “I don’t think that a lot of issues got out to the people. I think a lot of it was overall community involvement and, I guess, name recognition was a part of it,” Nalley said. “I think I’ve been highly visible in the community. I think with the issues, I think we all shared our strong concerns about the children in our community, the current state of education with funding and a lot of the issues are going to affect our youth directly.” He is also excited by the opportunity to serve. “I consider the schools and our children as one of the crown jewels of our community. I think we have a lot of potential and I think we will continue to strive to improve and continue all the good things we have going on in our school district,” Nalley said. Laura Lehmann received 3,443 votes (17.9%). She didn’t think there was one single issue that stood out in the campaign. “I think that people know that there are issues in the school system that are overlooked. Fremont has a good school system. We have a good thing going. There’s just issues that we still have to take care of,” Lehmann said. More than a specific issue, she thinks it may have come down to personalities. She didn’t do door-to-door campaigning, but did attend candidate forums. She also knows a lot of people who have been involved in the school system, from being a part of the activities her children were involved in. “I’m a well-known person, and people respect me,” Lehmann said about the possible reason people voted for her. “They know that I’m going to be a good leader, I care about the kids and they trust me. When it comes to the children, I think people know that I will get to the root of a problem, for the kids who need help out there.” She’s hoping to get to know more than just board members, but teachers and children of the district. Finishing out of the running were Alex Gorobetz, with 3,152 votes (16.39%), Kara Eisenhauer with 2,752 (14.31%) and Mary Alice Espiritu with 2,123 (11.04%). Two hot-button statewide issues took center stage and may have been the reason for the high turnout. Sandusky voters voted against State Issue 1 legalizing abortion and other reproductive decisions with yes votes coming in at 9,149 (45.29%) to the no votes coming in at 11,050 (54.71%). The statewide result was nearly opposite, with 2,074,030 (55.32%) voting Yes and 1,629,898 (44.00%) voting no. With State Issue 2 to commercialize, regulate, legalize, and tax the use of recreational marijuana, Sandusky County voters supported the change, with 10,532 (52.21%) of the vote for the issue and 9,641 (47.79%) against. That more closely reflected the statewide vote, as a whole, with 2,096,074 (56.65%) for and 1,604,067 (43.35%) against the change. Dozens of roads closed, some homes \'destroyed\' Up to a dozen homes were severely damaged, dozens of roads were closed, a number of barns and outbuildings were leveled and countless trees and utility poles were toppled by severe winds and a possible tornado Thursday evening [June 15] along the border of Sandusky and Ottawa counties. Fred Petersen, director of the Ottawa County Emergency Management Agency said [June 15] he\'s ""99% confident it\'s a tornado,"" but the National Weather Service is expected to survey damage and make the call. ""There are trees lying in different directions and by the nature of the damage"" it appears it was caused by a tornado. Petersen was surveying the damage around 8:30 p.m. along Ohio 19 about two miles south of Oak Harbor, where several barns were flattened, utility poles and wires were sprawled across roads, and some trees appeared to have been shredded. He said he had not heard any reports of injuries from the storm, which struck Northwest Ohio starting around 7:30 p.m. Lisa Kuelling, director of the Sandusky County Emergency Management Agency, said there was widespread damage along the northern section of Sandusky County, but she also had heard no reports of injuries. ""I got a chance to get out and look at some of the damage but I\'m not sure yet if we can determine it was a tornado,"" Kuelling said about 9:45 p.m. The storm downed power lines, damaged some homes and outbuildings, and knocked over numerous trees, she said. ""There were some buildings with their roofs completely taken off. One shed was picked up and thrown out into the middle of a road. Trees were blocking roads. There was some damage to homes but nothing that I would consider \'destroyed,\'"" Kuelling said. She said the storm first hit in Rice Township in the west and moved east through Townsend, Riley, Green Creek and York townships. Karen Clark, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Cleveland, said Friday morning that three teams were looking at damage between Fremont and Clyde and continuing to Huron County. ""We have reports of damage in that area, and the question is whether it\'s tornadic in nature or whether it\'s straight-line winds,"" Clark said. She said the storm originated near Toledo, moved south of Sandusky Bay, then redeveloped in Fremont and moved southeast toward Ashland. She said wind gusts of 66 mph were reported in Toledo and hail 2.25 inches in diameter fell in Ashland Thursday night. Clark said the NWS plans to release a report sometime Friday afternoon determining whether a tornado caused the damage. Emergency officials blocked off 20-25 roads due to downed powerlines and fallen trees, including intersections at such major thoroughfares as Ohio 53, Ohio 6, and Ohio 101, Kuelling said. The Ohio Turnpike said both eastbound and westbound lanes near milepost 94 in Sandusky County were closed temporarily due to downed power lines and debris from the storm. The eastbound lanes opened after a delay but the westbound lanes remained closed for about 24 hours, reopening around 7:30 p.m. Friday. The National Weather Service had issued a severe weather bulletin and a tornado warning at 6:45 p.m. and then extended the tornado warning until 8:15. The NWS reported winds were gusting up to 60 mph with hail of 1.75-inch diameter. Petersen said between 8 and 12 homes were ""uninhabitable,"" and several of those were ""maybe even totally destroyed."" He said he contacted the Red Cross to help residents who were affected by the storm and said they were not planning to'}]"

Alum Creek Drive project Brad Foster, chief deputy of operations for the Franklin County Engineer’s office, said a proposed project improving Alum Creek Drive from State Route 317 to Groveport Road, has a projected construction time frame of 2028 to 2029. The estimated cost is $58.5 million, with 80 percent covered by federal dollars and the remaining 20 percent from $11.5 million in local money, including public and private funds. Replacing the bridge crossing Big Walnut Creek and adding additional lanes to Alum Creek Drive without major interruptions to traffic are key pieces of the project. Foster said many of the shipments heading to the new Intel facility in Licking County will pass in and out of the Rickenbacker airport. “Alum Creek Drive is a major thoroughfare,” said Foster. “We need all stakeholders (Columbus, Groveport, Obetz and Madison and Hamilton townships) on board.” Arbor Day in Groveport The city of Groveport will hold Arbor Day events on April 28 at 1:30 p.m. at Glendening Elementary and at 2:30 p.m. at Groveport Elementary.

planet inhospitable to human life.” That’s what the lead researcher in Project Censored’s number one story this year said. He wasn’t talking about the climate catastrophe. He was talking about so-called “forever chemicals,” per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), linked to prostate, kidney, and testicular cancer and additional health risks, and the study he led found unsafe levels in rainwater worldwide. Even though this story received some corporate media attention — in USA Today and the Discovery Channel — the starkly shocking bottom line clearly didn’t come through to the general public. Have you heard it before? Has it been the subject of any conversation you’ve had? No? Well, that, my friend, is the very essence of what Project Censored’s signature “top ten” list is all about exposing the suppression (active or passive) of vitally important information from the public, which renders the public unable to act in the way that a healthy democratic public is supposed to. They’ve been doing it since Carl Jensen began it with a single college class in 1976, inspired in part by the way the Watergate story got this same sort of treatment until well after the election cycle it was part of. But there’s a second story intertwined with the “forever chemicals” pervasive presence: the revelation that companies responsible for them have known about their dangers for decades, but kept those dangers hidden — just like fossil fuel companies and climate catastrophe. The intersection of environmental/public health and corporate criminality is typical of how certain long-standing patterns of censored news weave together across the years, even decades, and how the spotlight Project Censored shines on them helps to make sense of much more than the individual stories it highlights, as vitally important as they are in themselves. In previous years, I’ve highlighted the multiplicity of patterns of censorship that can be seen. In their introduction to the larger 25-story list in their annual book, The State of the Free Press, Andy Lee Roth and Steve Macek describe these patterns at two levels. First, invoking the metaphor that “exemplary reporting is praised for ‘shining light’ on a subject or ‘bringing to light’ crucial facts and original perspectives,” they say: But in addition, they say, it’s important to see the “list as the latest installment in an ongoing effort to identify systemic gaps in so-called ‘mainstream’ (i.e., corporate) news coverage.” They go on to say, “Examining public issues that independent journalists and outlets have reported but which fall outside the scope of corporate news coverage makes it possible to document in specific detail how corporate news media leave the public in the dark by marginalizing or blockading crucial issues, limiting political debate, and promoting corporate views and interests.” On the one hand, all that is as true as it’s ever been. But on the other hand, the two-story themes in the number one story — environmental harm and corporate abuse — so dominate the top ten story list that they send another message as well, a message about the fundamental mismatch between our needs as a species living on a finite planet and a rapacious economic system conceived in ignorance of that fact. The climate catastrophe is just the most extreme symptom of this mismatch — but it’s far from the only one. Corporate abuse figures into every story in the list — though sometimes deep in the background, as with their decades-long efforts to destroy unions in story number six. Environmental harms “only” show up in seven of the 10 stories. There are still other patterns here, to be sure — and I encourage you to look for them yourself because seeing those patterns enriches your understanding of the world as it is, and as it’s being hidden from you. But this dominant pattern touches us all. The evidence is right there, in the stories themselves. Rainwater is “no longer safe to drink anywhere on Earth,” Morgan McFall-Johnsen reported in Insider in August 2022, summing up the results of a global study of so-called “forever chemicals,” polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. Researchers from Stockholm University and the Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics at ETH Zurich concluded that “in many areas inhabited by humans,” PFAS contamination levels in rainwater, surface water, and soil “often greatly exceed” the strictest international guidelines for acceptable levels of perfluoroalkyl acids. They’re called “forever chemicals” because they take so long to break down, “allowing them to build up in people, animals, and environments,” Insider reported. Project Censored notes, “Prior research has linked these chemicals to prostate, kidney, and testicular cancer and additional health risks, including developmental delays in children, decreased fertility in women and men, reduced vaccine efficacy, and high cholesterol.” “PFAS were now ‘so persistent’ and ubiquitous that they will never disappear from the planet,” Lead researcher Ian Cousins told Agence France-Presse. “We have made the planet inhospitable to human life by irreversibly contaminating it now so that nothing is clean anymore. And to the point that it’s not clean enough to be safe,” he said, adding that “We have crossed a planetary boundary,” a paradigm for evaluating Earth’s capacity to absorb harmful impacts of human activity. The “good news” is that PFAS levels aren’t increasing in the environment. “What’s changed is the guidelines,” he said. “They’ve gone down millions of times since the early 2000s, because we’ve learned more about the toxicity of these substances.” All the more reason the second strand of this story is important: “The same month,” Project Censored writes, “researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, published a study in the Annals of Global Health using internal industry documents to show that the companies responsible for ‘forever chemicals’ have known for decades that these substances pose significant threats to human health and the environment.” There’s been limited corporate media coverage that rainwater isn’t safe to drink — specifically from USA Today, the Discovery Channel and Medical News Today. But the general public clearly hasn’t heard the news. However, there’s been more coverage of the series of lawsuits developing in response to PFAS. But the big-picture story surrounding them remains shockingly missing. “Google — one of the largest and most influential organizations in the modern world — is filled with ex-CIA agents,” Alan MacLeod reported for MintPress News in July 2022. “An inordinate number of these recruits work in highly politically sensitive fields, wielding considerable control over how its products work and what the world sees on its screens and in its search results.” “Chief amongst these is the trust and safety department, whose staff, in the words of the Google trust and safety vice president Kristie Canegallo, ‘[d]ecide what content is allowed on our platform’ — in other words, setting the rules of the internet, determining what billions see and what they do not see.” And more broadly, “a former CIA employee is working in almost every department at Google,” Project Censored noted. But Google isn’t alone. Nor is the CIA. “Former employees of U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies now hold senior positions at Google, Meta, Microsoft, and other tech giants,” Project Censored wrote. A second report focused on employees from Israel’s Unit 8200, its equivalent of the CIA, which is “infamous for surveilling the indigenous Palestinian population,” MacLeod wrote. Using LinkedIn, he identified hundreds of such individuals from both agencies, providing specific information about dozens of them. “The problem with former CIA agents becoming the arbiters of what is true and what is false and what should be promoted and what should be deleted is that they cut their teeth at a notorious organization whose job it was to inject lies and false information into the public discourse to further the goals of the national security state,” MacLeod wrote, citing the 1983 testimony of former CIA task force head John Stockwell, author of In Search of Enemies, in which he described the dissemination of propaganda as a “major function” of the agency. “I had propagandists all over the world,” Stockwell wrote, adding: “We pumped dozens of stories about Cuban atrocities, Cuban rapists [to the media]… We ran [faked] photographs that made almost every newspaper in the country … We didn’t know of one single atrocity committed by the Cubans. It was pure, raw, false propaganda to create an illusion of communists eating babies for breakfast.” “None of this means that all or even any of the individuals are moles — or even anything but model employees today,” MacLeod noted later. But the sheer number of them “certainly causes concern.” Reinforcing that concern is big tech’s history. “As journalist Nafeez Ahmed’s investigation found, the CIA and the NSA were bankrolling Stanford Ph.D. student Sergey Brin’s research — work that would later produce Google,” MacLeod wrote. “Not only that but, in Ahmed’s words, ‘senior U.S. intelligence representatives, including a CIA official, oversaw the evolution of Google in this'}]"

Union County Sheriff Jamie Patton said the department’s new contract may be a “game-changer” for staffing issues at the agency. After spending the better part of the last year or more traveling the state in search of new recruits, Patton said this new agreement should help the sheriff’s office be competitive with neighboring agencies and also, hopefully, retain deputies at the sheriff’s office. “A few weeks ago I met with the county commissioners because this was specific to salaries and dealing with budgets. I proposed a solution to our hemorrhaging and our massive bleed at the sheriff’s office with staffing conditions,” he said. “I’m excited and I think this will be a game-changer.” Patton said the new proposal will bring base salaries up to match those at the Marysville Division of Police as the office has recently lost five deputies to the city agency alone. Deputies have also gone to other agencies in the central Ohio region, but Marysville is a top competitor. The existing contract stipulated that sheriff’s deputies would receive a 10% pay increase for 2023, a 3% increase in 2024 and a 3% increase in 2025. The contracts are set for a three-year period. “Now, with the new proposal, to match Marysville, the deputies will get their original 3% plus 5.5% in ’24 for a total of 8.5%,” he said. “In ’25, they’ll get their original 3% from the original contract plus 6.1% for a total of a 9.1% total increase.” The new numbers will take effect on Jan. 1 next year and was made possible with the passage of the 2024 county budget last month, which included an increase to the sheriff’s office budget from $9.4 million to $10.6 million. Patton said previously that the office had trouble getting and retaining deputies for a variety of reasons, ranging from a diminishing interest in law enforcement to financial considerations. The office had half a dozen open positions in the summer of 2022 and has almost doubled that number in the last year. Lately, he said, the primary concern coming from people interested in coming to the sheriff’s office is the high cost of living. “Especially in today’s market, where housing is challenging, interest rates are higher,” Patton said. “The common theme that we’ve currently heard is ‘what you have shared about your agency is really interesting and we’d explore it more but right now we can’t.’” He said unless the potential recruit is looking for an apartment, which may be an easier financial decision for some, those looking for houses said the transition isn’t feasible. The sheriff’s office also stipulates that deputies have to either live in the county or in an adjacent county. The longer distance drive can be a deterrent for potential recruits, he added, as well as not being able to live in the community they serve. Patton said while he’s looking forward to the opportunities this new contract will provide, it doesn’t come without a sacrifice. “Because of the dollars we’re talking about, with the 10 open positions I have currently, to make this work with these increases, I had to give up six positions,” he said. “In ’24, I’m approved to hire four with the understanding, the commissioners said the door is open to come back and discuss additional positions, once I get those four hired.” He said he’s okay with the staggered approach, as the process to hire 10 hasn’t really panned out. “It’ll probably take us into mid-year, close to our budget discussions in October of ’24, to get the four that are in the academy on the road and then getting the four new positions hired, that’s going to be a task in itself,” Patton said. “We’ll get through it, we can survive. We’re surviving now but we’re doing it with a lot of extra time by the current staff we have.” He said offering relief to his current staff, who has stepped up repeatedly to fill the gaps, is reason enough to be happy this proposal was approved. “I feel the stress of the employees that are mandated to work overtime and forced to work mandated shifts to pick up the slack of us being down on staffing,” Patton said. “And it doesn’t help morale and it doesn’t help our folks.” Overall, Patton said, this is some of the better news his office has had in a while. “I really do think it will change the game for us and I think we’ll be able to recruit more. And folks that are working at other agencies may look at this as an ability to help their family because they’re potentially going to make more than those working to the east or north of us,” he said. “And I can’t say enough about the commissioners being willing to work with me to get this initiative to where it is right now.

Pitchers are also only allowed to step off the mound twice in one at bat, another rule meant to shorten games. The 2023 World Baseball Classic opens March 8, as Cuba plays the Netherlands. Defending champion team USA, captained by Mike Trout, opens pool play on March 11, at 9 p.m. ET. Fox Sports announced that Hall of Fame former Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter will be a part of its MLB studio coverage for the 2023 season.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 5:16 am Shelley Terry Faithful readers, brace yourselves for some bittersweet news. I’ll soon be bidding farewell to the Star Beacon. After a total of 35 years of delivering breaking news stories, unforgettable calamities and humorous columns, I’m retiring at the end of the year. For 23 of those 35 years, I’ve worked at the Beacon and, for the most part, I’ve loved every minute of it, thanks to my many wonderful co-workers. But it’s time for me to take off my trusty news hat and retire to a life of travel and (hopefully) peaceful bliss. Between us, I can’t imagine not writing every day, so I will continue my Terry Cloth column, as well as freelance writing for the Beacon. But for now, join me, faithful readers, as we take a stroll down memory lane at some of my most memorable stories from the start of my career, circa 1988-1994, in the Carolinas. In the following weeks, I will share tales from Florida and finally, in Ashtabula County. Here goes: • The sentencing hearing of a South Carolina man who broke into his estranged wife’s trailer and stabbed her multiple times in the chest reigns No. 1 in my courtroom experiences. Somehow, the woman lived and during her victim’s statement to the judge, her voice started low and rose to what can only be described as a wail. Then, she tore open her blouse — buttons go flying everywhere — and exposed her scarred, bare chest to the court while shouting, “See! See what he did to me!” Her husband, who was seated at the defense table with his lawyers, then stood up and cried out, “But I loved you!” and promptly fainted! • Faithful readers may believe that covering the annual frog jump at the Ashtabula County Fair is something new for me. Not so! While working in Rock Hill, S.C., I covered the Come-See-Me Festival, which included an annual frog jump. My friend and our family’s dentist, Dr. Cranford, and his children entered the jump every year. I got the brilliant idea of accompanying them when they caught their frogs. The newspaper’s photographer and I met the good doctor at a “secret pond” out in the middle of nowhere. It was a pitch black night and kind of creepy. As we waded in the murky pond, a vehicle with flashing lights came rumbling down the path to the pond. It was the cops! They said we were trespassing and told us to put our hands up. “Do you think [our editor] will bail us out?” I asked the photographer. At that moment, Cranford and the police officers started laughing. It was a joke! Whew! Cranford set us up. “You got me!” the photographer said. “Me too!” I said, relieved that I wasn’t going to spend the night in the slammer. I vowed revenge, but moved to Florida, where I covered the Fellsmere Frog Leg Festival every year. Go figure! • When I wasn’t chasing frogs, I was lucky enough to meet some celebrities. My first such interview was with Walt Willey from the daytime soap opera, “All My Children.” Walt played Jack Montgomery, the love interest for Erica, played by Susan Lucci. I was so excited to meet him! During my days as a stay-at-home mom, I faithfully watched the show. As expected, Walt was handsome and charming. Definitely a highlight of my early career. • After the Walt Willey gig, I got to interview Frankie Avalon. He was in town shooting a Sonic Drive-In commercial. He drove up in a 1960s red corvette with white interior and sang his hit song, “Venus,” just for me. How cool is that? • But at the top of the list, the No. 1 famous celebrity I’ve ever met was Neil Diamond. I interviewed him over the phone shortly after our birthdays (we share Jan. 24), and before his Feb. 3 concert in Charlotte, N.C. We hit it off during the phone interview and he invited me backstage to meet him before the show. He said no one ever asked him the questions I asked him. For example, I asked, “In the movie, ‘What About Bob?’ Bill Murray’s character says there are two types of people in the world — those who love Neil Diamond and those who hate him. What do you think about that?” He laughed and laughed at that question. As it ended up, I spent about 20 minutes with Neil and he gave me an autographed photo book that he signed, “Happy birthday, Shelley. Love Neil Diamond.” His assistant took a photo of us together and later mailed it to me. I was on top of the world. When I took my seat — the best seat in the house — I felt like the luckiest girl in the world. Even today, when I think about it, those feelings return. And, you know what? I am the luckiest girl in the world! Not just because I met Neil Diamond, but because for the past 35 years, I have woken up every morning, looking forward to going to work because I loved my job.

There wasn\'t a big birthday bash. Instead, Biden marked the day ""pardoning"" two turkeys, carrying out the longtime White House tradition ahead of Thanksgiving. ""It\'s my birthday today,"" Biden said, kicking off the turkey ceremony on the White House South Lawn. ""I just want you to know, it\'s difficult turning 60,"" he joked. Biden, already the oldest president in U.S. history, would be 86 when he completed a second term if reelected. Biden said Steve Lykken, chairman of the National Turkey Federation, and Lykken\'s family sang ""Happy Birthday"" to him inside the White House before the event. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden will celebrate his birthday this week with his family in Nantucket, Mass. − where the Bidens historically travel for Thanksgiving − and enjoy some coconut cake, a Biden family favorite. Biden has often made light of his octogenarian status − ""I know I\'m 198 years old,"" the president joked in June − as poll after poll shows it remains one of his biggest election liabilities. A poll by Monmouth University in October found 76% of voters believe Biden is too old to effectively serve a second term, compared with 48% who said the same about Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who is 77. ""Our perspective is that it\'s not about age. It\'s about the president\'s experience,"" Jean-Pierre said, responding to age concerns. ""I would put the president\'s stamina, the president\'s wisdom, ability to get things done on behalf of the American people up against anyone of any day of the week."" But an NBC News poll released Sunday found Biden is trailing in a hypothetical rematch against Trump with voters ages 18 to 34, a group that is historically part of the Democratic base. Trump is backed by 46% of young voters,; Biden is supported by 42%. The poll found that Biden\'s approval rating has dropped to 40%, an all-time low for the poll, and that Trump, despite his multiple indictments and legal troubles, leads nationally in a hypothetical matchup 46%-44%. Jean-Pierre acknowledged that some Americans have hardened views about Biden. ""We\'re not going to change the minds of Americans. I get that. Americans are going to feel how they feel, and we\'re going to respect that,"" she said. ""What I can tell you is what our perspective is. What I can tell you is how we see things. And we believe this president having experience to get things done is important."" Concerns about Biden\'s age has prompted a Democratic primary challenge from Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., who has argued for a new generation of Democratic leadership in the White House. Some Republican candidates have openly questioned whether Biden will finish a second term if he\'s reelected, warning voters that a vote for Biden is a vote for Vice President Kamala Harris as president. Biden has addressed questions about his age routinely since announcing his reelection bid. ""I respect them taking a hard look at it,"" Biden said in April, referring to voters who worry about his age. ""I\'d take a hard look at it as well.

""Death of Napoleon,"" a headline over the story said, with a dateline revealing the first part of the news had come from London on Jan. 8. ""Napolean III died at twelve twenty-eight today,"" the single sentence report said. A second portion of the report was datelined ""NEW YORK, January 9,"" and it gave readers details of the death of Charles Louis Napoleon Bonaparte – Napoleon III – the first president of France from 1848 to 1852 and the last monarch of that country as emperor from 1852 to 1870. ""The news of the death of Emperor Napoleon, which was received in this city before nine o\'clock this morning, was not entirely unexpected from the tone of the dispatches received yesterday,"" the article reported. ""It is seldom that a man at the advanced age of Napoleon (he being now 65) has recovered from such illness. ""Many have wondered that the ex-Emperor allowed himself to undergo the series of operations which have thus resulted in his death."" The death of the former French leader was significant news in its own right. Still, Napoleon\'s passing took on additional significance to those studying the history of the Repository. It brought to mind previous news coverage of a Napoleon. Decades before, not long after the newspaper\'s founding, it had reported on Napoleon III\'s uncle, Napoleon I – Napoleon Bonaparte. The defeat of that elder Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815, was the first major news event covered in The Ohio Repository by the newspaper\'s founder John Saxton. A story about Napoleon\'s loss in the fighting appeared on Page 3 of the Aug. 17, 1815, Repository. The fact that news of the battle was published weeks after the battle had concluded can be forgiven. The delay was not editor Saxton\'s fault. Details of Napoleon\'s defeat were carried a great distance on horseback, aboard ship, and in stagecoaches before dispatches reached Canton. ""To the polite attention of our Boston correspondent, we are indebted for a copy of Lord Wellington\'s official account of the series of actions fought on the 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th of June,"" the brief ""Defeat of Bonaparte"" article said. ""Bonaparte was defeated with the loss of 20,000 men killed and wounded."" A week later, on the front page of his Aug, 24, 1815, newspaper, Saxton offered additional details of Napoleon\'s defeat. This front-page article, however, offered a different perspective – that of the victors. It was a dispatch sent from Waterloo by a British officer on the day after the decisive battle, which, according to online histories, concluded a 23-year war, ended attempts by France to rule Europe, and took away power in his own country that Napoleon fought to obtain. The dispatch sent by the British officer carried details of ""gallantry by these brave troops"" who had ""fought to victory over Napoleon."" This report, dated June 19, 1815, from Waterloo, was headlined ""Highly Interesting Intelligence"" in the Repository, which noted that it came from the London Gazette. It detailed days of battles leading up to the Napoleon\'s ultimate defeat. An accompanying article datelined ""Boston, August 4"" reported on the ""Abdication of Bonaparte."" ""After the battle of the 18th, Bonaparte left his army, alone and in disguise, and arrived in Paris in one day and a night,"" the article reported, noting that the French legislature\'s spurning of his request for men and money to continue the war led to his abdication. ""He wished to make his abdication conditional, in favor of his son, but to this condition the chambers refused to accede,"" said the Repository report. ""He finally complied with their wish, renouncing unconditionally his authority. ... It was announced that Bonaparte and his family were confined as prisoners by the French government."" According to the website history.com, Napoleon was exiled to a remote British island of St. Helena, in the South Atlantic Ocean, in October 1815. ""He died there on May 5, 1821, at age 51, most likely from stomach cancer,"" the website noted. Napoleonic reign in France, however, didn\'t end with the passing of the first Napoleon. According to one online history, Napoleon Bonaparte\'s son, Napoleon II, ""arguably"" was briefly the leader of France for those few days in June and July of 1815, before the coalition of French leaders rejected the father\'s wishes that he be succeeded by his son. Decades later, Napoleon III, Napoleon Bonaparte\'s nephew, managed to become the leader of France as both president and monarch. ""After a turbulent youth and several attempts to seize power during the July Monarchy, he was elected President of the French Second Republic in 1848,"" according to one online site devoted to French history. ""He turned his presidency into an imperial title thanks to a coup on December 2, 1851, proclaiming himself Napoleon III, Emperor of the French."" Although another website article written by a history educator named David Labaree calls the French leader a bit of a ""buffoon,"" the writer acknowledged. ""Napoleon III was not a bad guy. For one thing, he was remarkably likeable, something that no one ever said about his uncle. "" The Repository news obituary said explained that early in the 1850s a decree declaring universal suffrage was issued after a period of military control, ""and the election of a President for 10 years"" resulted in Napoleon III becoming president. ""The national guard was revived; new constitution was adopted; new orders of nobility established"" and Napoleon III was elevated to ""imperial dignity."" ""His reign was despotic but was tolerated by the people as a relief from the long series of wars and revolutions which they had undergone,"" the Repository said, teaching its readers a lesson in world history. ""Symptoms of dissatisfaction were, however, sometimes shown, particularly on Jan. 14, 1858, when an attempt was made to take his life."" That assassination attempt was unsuccessful, but 15 years later the newspaper had the opportunity finally to report on the death of Napoleon III, which came after France\'s defeat in the Franco-Prussian war and Napoleon III\'s final expulsion as emperor and his ""retirement"" to England. Stories about Napolean III\'s death 150 years ago would complete the Repository\'s coverage of the Napoleon family\'s quest for power. Looking back at the news reports provides a lesson in how a newspaper--how a community--that focuses primarily on local occurrences often looks outward to see its place in the larger world. Ultimately, at a time when far more major events were being reported on by the Repository than during the first few weeks following its founding, the newspaper was almost dismissive in its reporting. ""All (details about Napoleon III\'s life) are familiar to our readers and need no further mention,"" said the Repository article at the end of its profile of Napoleon III. ""For several days past the illness of the Emperor has been the subject of frequent telegraphic mention, so that his death was not altogether unexpected."" Reach Gary at gary.brown.rep@gmail.com.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Kent Memorial Day parade in photos Board of Trustees approves budget for upcoming school year, increases tuition for incoming freshman class Spring 2024 Commencement in photos Video games have been around now for more than 30 years. However, people are just now beginning to conduct research on the correlation between video games and mental health. According to the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the unhealthy use of video games could potentially lead to the loss of social relationships, lower levels of interest or engagement in other activities and withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, anxiety, or sadness. Internet Gaming Disorder, or IGD, has become the term used to describe problematic gaming in online environments. Problematic gaming can be described as being the amount of toxicity in gaming communities and among the players of these communities. Enrico Gandolfi, an associate professor of educational technology, said that the American Psychiatric Association and the World Health Organization use the term Internet Gaming Disorder as a way to describe the various negative aspects gaming has on mental health such as addiction, increased anxiety when not playing and playing to relieve negative feelings. There has been an increased interest in gaming addiction, due in part to the extreme popularity of playing video games both on and offline in recent years. The clinical diagnosis of IGD was first introduced in the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Health Disorders, fifth edition” in 2013. A diagnosis of IGD is suggested on a basis of whether an individual meets five out of nine criteria, including preoccupation with video games, presence of withdrawal symptoms, a need to spend increased time playing video games, unsuccessful attempts at controlling gaming, loss of interest in other hobbies, jeopardizing or losing a relationship and deception of others regarding the amount of online gaming. Gandolfi said the research on the subject of video games and mental health is very controversial because there is evidence of the benefits playing games can have as well. “A lot of times, yes there may be significant associations between playing video games and being depressed or socially isolated,” he said. “However, there is also evidence of the opposite. Gaming communities can promote safe spaces for players and have very meaningful experiences for them.’’ Online gaming has been the next era of video gaming, and its consumption has led to millions of players being able to play collaboratively with each other. Research done on the subject has suggested that gaming can cause community bonding among players, an increased sense of creativity and can help players learn empathy by learning how to get along with other players through an online environment. At the other end of the spectrum, research has shown that gaming in online environments can lead to disruptive behaviors and hostility among players within a gaming community. “Games can be great, but they can also be bad depending on how we use them, but we need to remember that they’re just tools,” Gandolfi said. “It depends on how we use them and whether we are already predisposed to mental health disorders or not.” Turan Koptur, an associate professor of animation game design and founder of SquareTableGames, said that parents of young children need to be checking in on them and deciding what games they should and shouldn’t be playing. “Some parents do not care for their child properly or as much as they should be, and this can ultimately alter a child’s mental state as they grow older,” he said. “In turn, these children do not learn how to discern reality from fiction and games can increasingly take a toll on their mental health.” Koptur said games should not be blamed for this however, as they are only tools and tools don’t ultimately dictate the well-being of a person’s mental state. There are many outside factors that dictate this and research is still being done on the topic. “There are good and bad aspects to everything,” he said. “Games can be a way to bond with other people through the use of online gaming, games can be a way to promote stress relief as they allow for you to escape the realities of everyday life and they can even be a way to promote learning and critical thinking.” Chris Totten, an associate professor of animation and game design, said that playing video games can be used as a way to de-stress and help your mind relax. “Playing games can be a bad thing if you become addicted in order to escape reality, but generally for the average person this does not happen,” he said. “People use their imagination to escape as a way of dealing with the stressors of everyday life and this can be bad if you have mental illnesses to begin with, but in reality, we all need an escape sometimes.” Koptur said he had an online friend that was going through chemotherapy due to cancer and playing video games was a way for her to feel happy and escape the reality of her condition. “Playing video games gives people so many opportunities to experience things they can’t in everyday life,” he said. “And as they continue to develop as technology advances, more research will continue to be done on the different topics that encompass video gaming and mental health.” Leslie Lundy, the game director and lead designer of SquareTableGames, said that while attending Kent State she did research on topics related to mental health and video games and was able to find out that playing video games has more positive benefits to mental health than negative. “A lot of people use video games as a way to relax and unwind after a hard day,” she said. “On the flip side, however, people and researchers claim that they harm the mental health of others.

Many stories have been told, books have been written, and a movie has been filmed covering the elusive creature. The Annual Mothman Festival, in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, is amping up to welcome people from all over the country to celebrate the stories that have kept people peering over shoulders and looking for the menacingly red eyes hinting that the creature is with them. According to the festival website, “The Mothman Festival is an annual event held every third weekend in September that commemorates the 1966 Point Pleasant, West Virginia Mothman sighting, which gave birth to the infamous, red-eyed winged legend. People from all over the world gather around our charming Main Street to celebrate their favorite cryptid during this one-of-a-kind event.” The event features vendors, cosplay, tours, attractions, food, live music, speakers, time in the Mothman Museum, and more. Jeff Wamsley is one of the founding members of the festival, having participated for over 20 years. “The initial reason was to attract people to Main Street and the retail stores. It still is, but we’ve grown massively,” Wamsley said. “You know, we aren’t bringing in 500 people anymore; we are bringing out 15,000. It is different, but it is still, basically, designed to help the Main Street area of downtown while celebrating the Mothman. Economically, this is a very important event. We had to cancel two years for Covid and people missed it. All the hotels, restaurants, and retail shops benefit from people who come to the festival.” According to Wamsley, there is a lot to enjoy, from typical festival faire to Point Pleasant specifics, such as the Mothman Museum, tours to the TNT area, and more. “I think a lot of it has to do with the vendors we have signed up, the merchandise, and the overall feel; it is like a family reunion each year with people coming back,” Wamsley said. “It is all free, outside of the food and vendors. It is a way for the people who like the supernatural and Men in Black to network and meet up.” At the end of the day, the most important element is the Mothman himself, as well as those who continue to keep his legacy alive. “It is the unknown that interests people in all this. The Mothman mystery will likely never be solved and that is the beauty of it. People can investigate on their own. This festival gives them an opportunity to talk to other people who are interested in the same subjects, make new friends, all while seeing what Point Pleasant has to offer with a rich river history, Native history, and more.” The festival is in the heart of Main Street, within proximity to the 200-500 blocks. Travelers will cross the green bridge into the city and turn left after driving a block. The Mothman Festival is scheduled for September 16 and 17.

Six Bataan Memorial Elementary students were honored as Kiwanis Terrific Kids. “Terrific Kids is a sponsored program in the elementary school. Teachers nominate them for being good kids,” said Port Clinton Kiwanis Club President, Dr. David George. “These are kids who are kind, respectful and do good things.” One student from kindergarten through fifth were chosen to attend the lunch.

Bataan Primary School Assistant Principal, Ryan Evarts, said one student from each grade is chosen as a Terrific Kid each month, and from that group, six of them are invited to the Kiwanis luncheon. “These kids put forth consistently strong effort, have positive behavior, and are kind to others,” Evarts said. Horne said it was “cool” to be invited to the luncheon. “I was chosen because I’m a good kid,” he said. 13abc Action News Chief Meteorologist Jay Berschback joins the Kiwanis Terrific Kids from Bataan Elementary at the Wednesday, Nov. 15 Kiwanis lunch at Ala Cart After Hours.

She said the program has many benefits for students. “It shows them that if they work hard and do the things that are expected and go above and beyond, they can get rewarded,” O’Neal said.

Understanding them lets you know where you stand in the fight against gun violence. With that, this blog will discuss the history of gun control alongside other essential information. Regulation of firearms in Canada can be traced back to the 19th century when the government ordered the licensing of various firearms, including air guns. The registration of handguns began officially in 1934 as a law, while automatic firearms followed suit in 1951. As of the late 1970s, anyone who wished to own or operate firearms was required to acquire a certificate (Firearms Acquisition Certificate, FAC) from the police agency. Canada didn’t stop at the FAC but required every firearm owner to own a license alongside the previous certificate. The permit was either a possession only (POL) or possession and acquisition (PAL), accompanied by a legal registration of all firearms. By 2005, nearly 3% of every Canadian household owned handguns, while at least 16% owned firearms of other types. Research shows that the Canadian Firearms Program (CFP) reported 1.8 million legal firearm licenses, approximately 5.5% of its then population. British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec, and Ontario were the most licensed provinces. October 2014 saw Stephen Blaney bring forward a bill that sought to minimize the legal requirements for transporting restricted firearms by licensed dealers. Compulsory training for all amateur firearms license applicants for greater safety in 2015 accompanied the law. In June 2019, the government conducted various amendments to the pre-existing laws, bestowing the responsibility of firearms management on technical professionals. Thus reinforcing transportation requirements, extending background checks to a lifetime (from five years), and restricting firearms from areas other than the range. Following the Nova Scotia attacks in 2020, Justin Trudeau, the then Prime Minister, announced that approximately 1,500 models of mainly semi-automatic firearms would be categorized as prohibited with immediate effect. The law provided owners of such guns with a two-year grace period and various disposal options, including selling one’s privately owned firearms to the government or voluntarily surrendering guns to the government. Those who failed to volunteer or sell firearms to the government were forced to let them go alongside a penalty or prosecution. October 2022 saw a national freeze regarding the transfer of handguns by individuals through regulatory amendments. Exemptions were offered to authorized people and athletes, trainers, and coaches of Olympic and Paralympic. Justin Trudeau’s order of 2020 was initially set to end in two years but was lengthened to October 2023 to allow the officials to prepare for the confiscation procedure. It was also meant to give the remaining businesses, families, and individuals with restricted firearms more time to comply with the order. Besides the gradual gun control practices, there are many other prohibitions surrounding guns in Canada, including: The currently prohibited firearms and devices include mechanical or electrical gadgets made to be modified to mimic a gun, handgun barrels below 105 mm, suppressors, and replica firearms. Any handgun ammunition made to go through the body armour is prohibited, excluding sporting rounds like SS197SR. Furthermore, Flechette rounds and explosive ammunition used alongside cartridges were also banned. Legally, the potential age for registering a non-prohibited firearm in Canada is eighteen years and above. However, children at 12 can acquire a minor’s license, which allows them to purchase ammunition and borrow a firearm unsupervised, mainly for hunting. The maximum capacity of a magazine is mainly determined by the type of gun it’s made for and not the potential type of firearm it may fit in. Due to this fact, the gun model doesn’t influence the magazine’s capacity but its own. Gun control has proven beneficial to Canadians in many ways. First, the country has reported minimized cases of accidental shootings among amateur gun handlers and children. There have also been fewer cases of gun violence in the country thanks to the regulations and the advancing gun detection technology. Gun control has made it difficult for people intending to initiate mass shootings to succeed, saving more lives. Citizens can walk confidently across the streets and visit other public areas, knowing their safety is assured thanks to gun regulations. Crime rates involving guns have also decreased significantly because potential criminals cannot access firearms. However, the connection between crime rates and gun control is complicated but still under further development. Lastly, gun control can assist in reducing the number of gun-related suicides or homicides since these firearms are the commonly used devices in such cases.'}]"

(Jeff Piorkowski, special to cleveland.com) PEPPER PIKE, Ohio -- With a larger-than-normal gathering expected, City Council moved its monthly work session Wednesday (July 19) from its small council chambers to the Pepper Pike Learning Center, next to Orange High School. The larger crowd was anticipated because the meeting’s main discussion topic is one that has dominated recent meetings -- and some conversations among residents: adding sidewalks to the city’s main streets. About 50 residents attended, many of whom offered their thoughts on the subject. Because the meeting was a work session, council took no official action, but it did start to lay the groundwork for what lies ahead if sidewalks are to become a part of the city’s scenery. Following a recent suggestion by Councilwoman Emmy Zatroch, the city has made available on its website a “frequently asked questions” answer list. That list, supplied by City Engineer Don Sheehy, answers questions such as “What is considered a public right-of-way?” and “What is the difference between a sidewalk and a recreational trail?” It also gives the locations of the sidewalks under consideration. Councilman Jim LeMay has been spearheading the sidewalk discussion among council and has provided a process for the city to follow in determining if sidewalks should be installed and the steps needed to accomplish that. Streets under consideration for sidewalks are Lander Road, Shaker Boulevard, Chagrin Boulevard and South Woodland Road. On Wednesday, LeMay suggested that the city start by concentrating on designing and developing one street for sidewalks -- Lander Road. According to the Sheehy fact sheet, Lander Road would be divided into four sections: from the north end of Chagrin Circle to South Woodland Road, at a cost of $145,000; South Woodland to Shaker Boulevard, at a cost of $465,000; Shaker Boulevard to Fairmount Boulevard, costing $500,000; and Fairmount Boulevard to Cedar Road, at $350,000. The total cost for sidewalks on Lander Road would amount to $1.46 million. Recognizing that some residents do not want sidewalks and believe they would change the city’s somewhat rural character, LeMay, Councilman Scott Newell and other council members spoke once more -- as they did at the previous council meeting at the urging of Councilman Manohar Daga -- of putting the issue to a citywide vote. Several residents who spoke Wednesday favored asking voters to decide. When asked after the meeting if a referendum could take place as early as the November election, LeMay said: ”I really wanted to go through the public hearing process first. Everyone is going to get notices mailed to their house (with design details), so I think we’ll have a better idea as to the support or opposition to this. “I’m concerned about (going to the ballot) before we have a plan in place, because people won’t know what they’re voting on.” Complicating a move to place the matter on the ballot is the fact that, if the sidewalk question were to be included on the Nov. 7 ballot, the city would have to file with the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections by Aug. 9 -- just three weeks from the meeting. Council has just one meeting planned ahead of that filing deadline -- on July 26 -- although a special council meeting could be called before Aug. 9. “I think there are some people afraid of the unknown, but when they see the actual plan, they might say, ‘That’s not so bad,’” LeMay said. “I wish I had another month to get the plan in place so people could see it and then make an informed decision, rather than voting in the abstract. It will be tough to meet that (Aug. 9) deadline because we won’t have something concrete to look at.” LeMay also would like to see two public hearings take place after the designs are made public so that residents can ask questions and get answers. If the August deadline cannot be met, a possible vote may have to wait until May 2024. “We heard a lot of voices on all sides tonight,” LeMay said. ”I like the process we’re working on. Everyone is having their say, which is important.” At the coming July 26 meeting, LeMay said he believes council will get all of its unanswered questions answered and that council may be ready to authorize Sheehy to begin design plans. Sheehy said the Lander plans can be completed relatively quickly, perhaps within a couple of weeks. A community survey completed early this year, taken by 27 percent of the city’s adults, showed that “sidewalks and walking paths” topped the list of amenities or services now missing in Pepper Pike, according to all three age groups -- 18-44, 45-64 and 65 and older. Although the Cuyahoga County Planning Commission, which conducted the survey, stated that the 27 percent, or 1,413 adults, was a “tremendous community response,” some in the audience didn’t think it was a large enough sampling of residents and want to see the matter on the ballot. Other residents also questioned the favorability of residents who live on the streets that would get the sidewalks. Among the things to be designed would be the 5-foot-wide sidewalks’ meander. Sidewalks poured in a meandering, rather than straight, path look more aesthetically pleasing as they make their way around existing trees or utilities, Sheehy told council. Some tress would, however, have to be removed. Another consideration is the sidewalks’ grading to ensure they are not too steep in areas where the terrain dips or rises. In response to a question from a man in the audience, Mayor Richard Bain said residents would not be responsible for clearing snow from the sidewalks. Bain also responded to a woman’s concern about how far a sidewalk might encroach on her front property. Sheehy said the city’s right-of-way, upon which sidewalks would be installed, can extend up to 29 feet from the road and onto residents’ lawns. “I just want to disabuse any misperception here,” Bain answered. “I don’t think this council would ever support, and I could never support, a walkway that extended to the back end of a right-of-way near your home. “Regardless of if we’re entitled to do it, no one is suggesting it. I never heard anyone, the engineer, suggesting that. I know it would not be supported.” Read more from the Chagrin Solon Sun.

reader, whenever pop culture pops I want you to know about it — right now. Welcome to my new column devoted to keeping you informed every Friday about what’s going in the whirlwind landscape of pop culture. From the latest in film, music, books and TV to the buzz of awards season and other hot button topics, the goal is to fill you in on what’s new in order to satisfy your entertainment cravings. Here’s what you need to know right now: Beyoncé's “Renaissance” film has arrived The 32-time Grammy winner’s highly anticipated concert film is an entertaining, surprisingly revealing love letter to her craft, ballroom culture and devoted Beyhive. Clocking in at 2 hours and 48 minutes, the film spotlights the pop icon’s “Renaissance World Tour” from its inception and including its opening in Stockholm, Sweden. It also pinpoints how 11-year-old Blue Ivy, Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s eldest, Grammy-winning daughter, joined the lineup of fantastic dancers after only initially appearing one time. Other highlights: “Cuff It” featuring a dazzling array of outfits; the humorous mute challenge; cameos by Megan Thee Stallion, Kendrick Lamar and Diana Ross; and Beyoncé's poignant Houston homecoming and home videos, including rare footage of her two youngest children, Rumi and Sir.

Featuring seven pop, film and Broadway-savvy alums of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” along with showstopping special guest Todrick Hall, the holiday extravaganza-eleganza ran the gamut. Standouts included delightful hostess Miz Cracker, the over-the-top physicality of the hilarious Jimbo, the old-school finesse of Alyssa Edwards, and the strikingly poised and seductive Marcia Marcia Marcia whose superb lip sync to “What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve?” leapt forth as a divinely nostalgic throwback. The high energy tour conceived with equal doses of naughty and nice also featured a surprise, in-the-audience appearance by Heidi N Closet. Overall, and based on the enthusiastic response from the jam-packed crowd, the high art of drag and its mainstream attachment to “RuPaul’s Drag Race” isn’t sashaying away anytime soon — especially in Dayton.
