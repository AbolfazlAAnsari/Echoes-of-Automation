That has led members of both groups to put sometimes conflicting pressure on elected leaders. Colin Jackson of the Michigan Public Radio Network reports. COLIN JACKSON, BYLINE: When driving north on the freeway coming from Detroit, you may notice Congregation Shaarey Zedek - a synagogue in the suburb of Southfield - out the window. It\'s where Rabbi Aaron Starr hosted several of Michigan\'s political leaders for a healing moment after the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Some 1,200 people were killed in that assault, and Hamas militants continue to hold hostages. AARON STARR: There was so much leadership that really was speaking out about Israel\'s right to defend itself and our need to protect Jews everywhere around the world, that Jews shouldn\'t have to live in fear. JACKSON: One leader who did not attend the gathering was Starr\'s own congresswoman, Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib. Starr says he reached out to her office following the October 7 attack. Several weeks later, he says they had a polite conversation. But he thinks Tlaib\'s remarks around Israel\'s response have been divisive. STARR: No one that I\'m aware of in the Jewish community, at least none of the Jewish leaders, claim that Israel is perfect. But we do think that Israel has a right to defend itself. And I would love to engage in conversation with the congresswoman on a deeper level. JACKSON: Tlaib\'s leaves office did not grant requests for an interview with NPR. Last November, the GOP-led House censured her for using rhetoric critics described as hateful. They pointed in part to a video Tlaib posted on social media that included protesters using a portion of the chant - from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. She later defended the phrase - from the river to the sea - as a, quote, ""aspirational call for freedom."" Others consider it an antisemitic call for the elimination of Israel and removal of Jews. Speaking on the House floor before that censure vote, Tlaib said critics were distorting her words. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RASHIDA TLAIB: No government is beyond criticism. The idea that criticizing the government of Israel is antisemitic sets a very dangerous precedent, and it\'s been used to silence diverse voices speaking up for human rights across our nation. JACKSON: Tlaib, the only Palestinian American serving in Congress, pointed to her own ties to the region. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TLAIB: We are human beings (crying) just like anyone else. My sity, my grandmother, like all Palestinians, just wants to live her life with freedom and human dignity we all deserve. JACKSON: Israel\'s counteroffensive into Palestinian territories has killed more than 28,000 people. That\'s according to Gaza health officials, who say most of the dead are women and children. Tlaib is calling for a cease-fire, but Starr argues that would allow Hamas to continue endangering Israelis. Drive about 30 minutes away from Starr\'s synagogue to a different part of the district, you\'ll find Dearborn, a largely Muslim Detroit suburb where many residents do want a cease-fire. SAMRAA LUQMAN: I mean, in order for us American Muslims to feel like we are being heard, we want to see elected officials respond in a way that\'s moral and just. JACKSON: Community organizer Samraa Luqman wants her elected leaders to show solidarity with the people of Gaza. Over 85% of its population has been displaced during Israel\'s retaliation - that\'s according to Human Rights Watch. President Biden\'s administration is trying to negotiate another pause in fighting. That pause would be tied to Hamas releasing hostages and humanitarian aid entering Gaza. In the U.S., all of this comes against the backdrop of an election year. LUQMAN: It\'s a lost opportunity for any candidate if you don\'t take the moral high ground and solicit us for votes. This is - we\'re going to vote in a bloc this time, and it\'s going to be with Palestine. JACKSON: Calls for political action are playing out in Michigan\'s presidential primary election. This weekend, Tlaib encouraged residents to vote uncommitted on their Democratic Party ballot, rather than for Biden. It\'s part of a statewide campaign called Listen to Michigan that\'s urging voters to use the primary to push for a change in Biden\'s policy toward Israel and Gaza. Early voting has already begun. The primary is next Tuesday. For NPR News, I\'m Colin Jackson in Detroit. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. NPR transcripts are created on a rush deadline by an NPR contractor.

The armed forces occupy a central place in Israel, where most citizens perform military service, and the war in Gaza triggered one of the largest mobilisations in its history, with some 300,000 reservists called up in a population of 10 million. The military’s casualty branch informs each family in person, amid pressure to hold prompt burials in keeping with religious tradition. That urgency is compounded by concern that social media-fuelled rumours from the battlefield will reach families before the formal account does. The task falls to tight-knit and discreet volunteer reservists who must drop everything, don dress uniforms, dash out to assemble in three- or four-person teams and find the family’s address within an hour of being summoned by phone. “The responsibilities are many, and heavy,” said one notification officer who, like three others who spoke to Reuters, did so on condition of anonymity. “And nowadays they include literally racing against WhatsApp messages.” The war in Gaza has left deep trauma on both sides. Israelis are mourning the 1,200 killed, according to Israeli tallies, during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, along with 134 still held hostage. On their side, Palestinians say almost 30,000 have been killed in the Israeli response. ‘REVERENCE AND DREAD’ More than 570 soldiers have been killed and 2,900 soldiers wounded in the more than four months since, a pace that has made the military lean all the more on the volunteers, who are on standby for casualty notifications in their hometowns. At least one team member is a doctor. Others have included lawyers, social workers, teachers or hairdressers – selected for their emotional fitness for a withering role. When they walk in the street, with their distinctive blue-yellow lanyards over their uniforms, the volunteers say they are often treated with a mix of reverence and dread. That raises the risk of them alarming the wrong people, or of the family they are due to notify being tipped off prematurely about their presence. Officers say a touch of subterfuge is required – as with the Eldors, where one of the team posed as a civilian passerby to establish initial contact. “When you come to a home, you can wear a long raincoat to obscure the uniform,” said one notifier. “What if no one’s there, but a neighbour sees you and tells the family, ‘Hey, there were three IDF officers here looking for you’?” The volunteers undergo training in which they practise delivering unembellished statements about the death, serious wounding or disappearance of a soldier. “What is most important is that first-degree family hear the news face-to-face, with utmost calmness and clarity, and never by phone or over the intercom,” said one officer. They also act out possible responses of next-of-kin. Putting a foot in the door is better than letting it be slammed in the notifiers’ faces, one officer said, citing concern that grief-maddened relatives might hole up inside and harm themselves. “There was a mother who slapped me. Another called me the Devil, because, in that house, at that moment, I had ruined her life,” recalled a second officer. “But it always ended with hugs. Everyone understands the process, in the end.” (Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Sharon Singleton) You must be logged in to post a comment.

University President Dr. Robbyn Wacker revealed in late November of 2023 that she would be leaving the University June 30, 2024, when her contract expires. Wacker joined me on WJON today and explained the reasons why she is choosing to leave the University and her plans going forward. Wacker says she loves St. Cloud State and this community and appreciates the kindness she has received during her time here. She explains she was tasked with 3 directives when hired which includes turning around enrollment, increase the visibility of the University, and instill a sense of pride. Wacker indicates the enrollment numbers are headed back in the right direction. This fall's enrollment numbers are showing a 16% increase of new undergraduates, 11.9% increase in new graduates, and transfer rates are up. Wacker says the visibility throughout the state has increased using various forms of advertising. She feels this success has instilled a sense of pride. Wacker acknowledges they still have challenges but feels the University is in a better place than when she found it and left some things the next President can build on. Wacker was hired at St. Cloud State in 2018 and has spent the last 6 years through challenging times for Universities which includes the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021. She says this was the right time to leave SCSU because she has accomplished what she set out to do. Wacker feels the campus is incredible safe and the neighborhoods around campus are also safe with lower than realized crime rates. She says there is a negative perception that campus and around campus isn't safe but that isn't true. Wacker appreciates the partnership with the St. Cloud P.D. President Wacker isn't sure what's next for her but she says she isn't retiring. She explains she is still passionate for higher education. Wacker indicated to me she would like to stay working in higher education but isn't sure right now what that will be. If you'd like to listen to my conversation with SCSU President Dr. Robbyn Wacker it is available below.""}]"
