It is Putin’s first interview to a Western media figure since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Carlson had released a video from Moscow on Tuesday in which he said he would be interviewing Putin. Carlson claimed that Western journalists had interviewed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy multiple times but could not be “bothered” to interview the Russian president. The interview will be posted Thursday, according to Justin Wells, head of programming at Carlson’s streaming network. It’s not known what was said in the interview. Putin has heavily limited his contact with international media since he launched the war in Ukraine in February 2022. Russian authorities have cracked down on media, forcing some independent Russian outlets to close, blocking others and ordering a number of foreign reporters to leave the country. Two journalists working for U.S. news organizations — The Wall Street Journal’s Evan Gershkovich and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Alsu Kurmasheva — are in jail on charges they reject. Western journalists were invited to Putin’s annual press conference in December — the first since the war began — but only two were given the chance to ask a question. Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters that Carlson was chosen for the interview because “he has a position which differs” from other English-language media. Before his exit from Fox, Carlson repeatedly questioned the validity of U.S. support for Ukraine following the Russian invasion, and he’s wondered why Americans are told to hate Putin so much. His commentaries were frequently circulated on Russian state-run media. In his video this week, Carlson denounced “corrupt” American media outlets for “fawning pep sessions” with Zelenskyy that he said were designed to get America into a war with eastern Europe and pay for it. Peskov also rejected Carlson’s suggestion that no Western journalists had submitted requests to interview Putin. He said the Kremlin has received many requests from large Western television channels and newspapers which, he asserted, “take a one-sided position.” Carlson’s position, Peskov said, “is in no way pro-Russian, nor pro-Ukrainian, but rather pro-American.” The Associated Press is among the outlets that has requested an interview with Putin. “Does Tucker really think we journalists haven’t been trying to interview President Putin every day since his full scale invasion of Ukraine?” CNN’s Christiane Amanpour said on X. “It’s absurd — we’ll continue to ask for an interview, just as we have for years now.” Carlson’s trip comes as he has planted himself on former President Donald Trump’s side in a growing split in the Republican party over Putin and the Ukraine war. Trump has pushed to cut off aid to Ukraine, and the GOP majority controlling the House of Representatives has complied. While many Republicans are critical of the Russian president and his invasion, Trump and others have argued the United States has no interest helping Ukraine defend itself. Carlson has also traveled to interview Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has fashioned himself into an icon for conservative populists across the globe and been Putin’s closest ally in the European Union. The interview with Putin, Carlson said in his video, will be distributed for free on his website and on X, formerly known as Twitter. Carlson, who was fired by Fox News in April, announced he was starting his own streaming service in December. Fox has offered no explanation for firing Carlson, who was its top-rated personality at the time. Like many people who leave the network that is conservative America’s most popular news outlet, he has struggled to remain in the public eye. Carlson worked at Fox News for more than a decade and hosted a show where he discussed conspiracy theories about Russia and the Jan. 6 insurrection. Russian state media on Wednesday extensively covered Carlson’s visit. Vladimir Solovyev, one of Russia’s most famous television hosts, said the interview would “break through the blockade and the narrative that exists” in Western media which, he said, focuses on “Putin’s unprovoked, brutal invasion of Ukraine.” Solovyev, whose show is often critical of Western media, said Carlson is “feared” because he does not align with that narrative. ___ Associated Press writer Nicholas Riccardi contributed to this report.

The measure was introduced Monday and referred to the State Government Committee. Lucien Greaves, the co-founder of The Satanic Temple, says the proposal shows a complete ignorance of constitutional law and what religious liberty means. “While you might not like public displays of one type, there is a whole unraveling that takes place when you start allowing the government to pick and choose which forms of expression they agree with, narrow their definition of what they think an appropriate religion is and also try to give nonbelief in general a lower tier in citizenship,” he said. The group received a lot of attention in Iowa last year when its display at the State Capitol was vandalized. According to police reports, an altar and headpiece of a Baphomet stature were damaged. The vandalism happened after significant criticism over the Satanic Temple of Iowa’s display during the holidays. Governor Kim Reynolds was among those who called it “absolutely objectionable”. The Iowa Department of Administrative Services said the temple met all the application requirements. Michael Cassidy, the Mississippi man charged with vandalizing the satanic display, is now facing an enhanced charge under Iowa’s hate crime law. Last week, the Polk County Attorney’s Office said Cassidy will face third-degree criminal mischief in violation of individual rights, a Class D felony. He is scheduled to be back in court on February 15. Greaves couldn’t say how many Satanic Temple members are in Iowa but did say they are hearing from more people who are interested in Satanism. “This is all backfiring for this Christian nationalist movement. They are overplaying their hand and they’re leading people to embrace Satanism. They’re leading people to object to what they’re doing,” said Greaves. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

The most recent slip-ups involved Biden mixing up the names of European leaders with past officials who had died years earlier. On Wednesday, Biden twice appeared to mix up late German Chancellor Helmut Kohl with former Chancellor Angela Merkel while talking about a conversation he had in 2021. Merkel was Germany’s leader during the event he was discussing, while Kohl died in 2017. That came after another error on Sunday, when he confused French President Emmanuel Macron for Francois Mitterand, a former French president who died in 1996. They are the latest examples in what has become a growing problem for Biden, who has referred to himself as a “gaffe machine” in the past. But they come as voters are voicing concerns about the 81-year-old president. An NBC poll released Wednesday found 76% of voters had major or moderate concerns about whether Biden has “the necessary mental and physical health to be president for a second term.” Eleven percent said they had no real concerns. Biden’s age has been an issue he has confronted directly and tried to overcome by asking voters to count on his experience and what he has been able to accomplish as president. But questions continue to pop up any time he makes a mistake while speaking or appears frail. “It's a double-edged sword to put him out on the campaign trail or in high-profile events. The upside is you could show people ‘look at him out there’ being active and speaking, whether on-script or extemporaneously interacting with people. And he could pull it off very well for hours or days in a row. But just one slip-up and that's probably what will get all the attention,” said Chris Devine, an associate professor of political science at the University of Dayton. But Biden isn’t alone in giving voters concern over his advanced age, as the same poll found 48% said they have major or moderate concerns about 77-year-old former President Donald Trump. Thirty-five percent said they had no real concerns. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has tried to draw attention to Trump’s age in the Republican primary race, especially after he confused her for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a rally. Before dropping out of the race, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ campaign had launched a “Trump accident tracker” on top of quips from the governor about Trump “losing his fastball.” Trump has also made other gaffes like saying he ran against former President Barack Obama or confusing former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who ran in the 2016 GOP primary, for his brother, former President George W. Bush. The old age of the candidates, who appear to be on a collision course for a 2020 rematch, has been one of the primary drivers behind their disdain for what’s to come at the top of the ticket in November. Voters in both parties have consistently told pollsters for months that they want someone new to be the presidential nominee. That has spurred some speculation that third-party candidates may have a bigger sway over the final results due to higher levels of disinterest in the two major political parties’ candidates, though experts say that is unlikely to materialize when it comes time for voters to cast a ballot. Challengers to the two frontrunners have also tried to harness that energy in their longshot campaigns, though they have limited success. Haley has frequently drawn attention to Trump’s age but lost primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. She was also handily defeated in Nevada’s primary election to “none of these candidates” without Trump on the ballot, though she did not campaign in Nevada and the election does not award any delegates. Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips has also tried to use Biden’s age against him in his longshot primary challenge. “In 2016, Joe Biden made the wrong decision by not running, and in 2024 he’s making the wrong decision by running. It gives me angst, but someone in Washington has to be honest and say what the entire country knows,” Phillips said in a post on X including videos of Biden speaking in 2016 and this year. While attacks about age are not having much of an effect in primary races, both campaigns have also tried to make it a factor in the general election. Biden’s campaign and other Democrats have tried to highlight Trump’s errors to counterbalance the frequent attacks against the president, who Trump’s campaign has tried to frame as a confused, elderly man incapable of serving another four-year term. It’s a risky strategy for Biden. While it may convince some voters that there is not a stark difference between the two elderly candidates, it could also draw more attention to a vulnerable issue for him. “We see this often in campaigns where one candidate has a weakness — whether that's a real weakness or at least the perceived one — what they do is say, ‘I know you are but what am I?’ and try to turn it back on the other candidate, and it rarely works,” Devine said. “Usually, if there's a narrative that attaches to someone, it's because people see something compelling there.”""}]"

The Supreme Court hears a case today that affects the state of Colorado, and potentially many more. The justices consider whether, under the Constitution, Colorado was right to disqualify Republican frontrunner Donald Trump for his effort to overturn the 2020 election that he lost. NPR's Carrie Johnson reports. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Norma Anderson watched intruders storm the U.S. Capitol on TV from her home in Colorado. NORMA ANDERSON: They're trying to overthrow the government, is what I was thinking. And, where is the National Guard? JOHNSON: Anderson is a Republican, the first woman to lead the Colorado House of Representatives and later the state Senate. Soon, she may occupy another place in the history books - as lead plaintiff in a case seeking to disqualify Donald Trump from the Republican Party ballot in Colorado. Anderson, who's 91 years old, says the case is her way of protecting democracy. ANDERSON: You have to remember, as old as I am - I was born in the Great Depression. I've lived through that - World War II. I remember Hitler. I remember - my cousin was with Eisenhower when they opened up the concentration camps. I had another cousin start in Africa and go all the way through to Germany. I mean, I understand protecting democracy. JOHNSON: Anderson and five other Colorado voters are relying on part of the 14th Amendment, passed after the Civil War to keep Confederates out of office. Jason Murray is their lawyer. He says the 14th Amendment remains relevant. JASON MURRAY: Those who drafted Section 3 of the 14th Amendment back in the 1860s were very clear that they understood this provision not just to cover former Confederates, but that it would stand as a shield to protect our Constitution for all time going forward. And so this is not some dusty relic. JOHNSON: This provision has been used to disqualify candidates only eight times since the 1860s, most recently two years ago in the case of a county commissioner from New Mexico who trespassed at the Capitol on January 6. It's never been used against a presidential candidate. But Murray says there's a reason to revive dormant language in the Constitution now, in this case. MURRAY: No other American president has refused to peacefully hand over the reins of power after losing an election. JOHNSON: The language in the so-called insurrection clause is simple. Anyone who engages in insurrection after taking an oath to support the Constitution is barred from holding public office unless two-thirds of Congress votes to grant that person amnesty. SCOTT GESSLER: If the U.S. Supreme Court allows these doors to open, what we're going to see is a constant stream of litigation. MURRAY: That's Scott Gessler. He served as a Republican secretary of state in Colorado, and he now works as a lawyer for Donald Trump. GESSLER: You're going to see attacks on President Biden. You're going to see attacks on Kamala Harris - Vice President Harris. You're going to see attacks on senators and representatives and other people trying to prevent them from being on the ballot. JOHNSON: In court papers, Trump's legal team has been arguing that part of the 14th Amendment doesn't apply to the president because he was not an officer of the United States since he was elected, not appointed. They say Trump did not engage in insurrection on January 6. And they say Congress needs to pass a law that answers questions about how to enforce that part of the Constitution. Again, Scott Gessler. GESSLER: And we have no guidance from Congress on what the proper standards are, what the proper burden of proof is, what insurrection means. JOHNSON: The case puts the Supreme Court in the middle of the presidential election for the first time since it stopped the Florida recount and handed the White House to George W. Bush in 2000. This time, the justices have a few options. They could decide to disqualify Trump, just like the highest court in Colorado did last December. They could decide this as a political question, one for lawmakers and voters to answer, not the courts. Or they could keep Trump on the ballot, as he and dozens of Republicans in Congress are asking. Not providing a clear answer before the November election or the certification in January could confuse or disenfranchise voters. Rick Hasen is a professor of law and political science at UCLA. RICK HASEN: So when you have such divided opinion and you have such a volatile situation, it's just better to have some certainty about this issue as soon as possible. JOHNSON: Hasen and two other election law experts wrote the justices to say a decision by the court not to decide could place the nation in great peril. HASEN: We think that it creates conditions for great political instability if the court leaves this issue open. JOHNSON: Jason Murray, who's arguing on behalf of the Colorado voters, also sees danger ahead - but from Trump. MURRAY: If you read Trump's brief, he has a not so subtle threat to the court and to the country that if he loses this case, there's going to be bedlam all over the country. And I take that as Trump once again trying to hold this country hostage. And I don't think the country should stand for it. JOHNSON: On the campaign trail in New Hampshire last month, Trump said he named three of the six conservative justices on the U.S. Supreme Court. Then he mused about what they might do and why. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: They want to show that they can't be bought, that the fact that you put them there and made their lives - took them from someplace where they were doing quite well. But you know what? They want to go out of their way to be politically correct. JOHNSON: The Supreme Court hasn't offered a timetable for its decision, but some legal experts think the justices could rule before the Super Tuesday primaries in early March. The question about Trump's disqualification in Colorado is playing out in different ways in other states, too. Hasen of UCLA thinks Chief Justice John Roberts will be working hard to avoid a sharp conservative and liberal split. HASEN: Unanimity, of course, would be best, but finding some way of reaching something where you bring in not just the Republican-appointed justices, but at least some of the Democratic-appointed justices, I think, is behind the scenes going to be among the most important things. JOHNSON: One way, he says, might be to find that the key part of the 14th Amendment requires Congress to pass a new law before it can be used. HASEN: I don't think that's a strong legal argument, but it's a very nice offramp if you're looking for one. It avoids the merits, and it kicks it to another body, and it keeps Trump on the ballot.
