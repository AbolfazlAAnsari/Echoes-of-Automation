people have been injured and nearby homes were evacuated following an explosion at an industrial building in Marengo on Thursday morning. According to the City of Marengo, the explosion took place at 11:16 a.m. at 810 East South Street. The building is owned by Heartland Crush, according to property records, but is operated by C6-Zero, a company that converts used roofing shingles into biodiesel and other products. Flames continued to be visible from the building for hours, with a large plume of smoke emanating from the building and visible at long distances. As of 7:05 p.m. on Thursday, the fire was not yet extinguished. Around 30 people were inside at the time of the incident, according to officials, all of which have been accounted for. As of mid-afternoon on Thursday, nobody was killed in the explosion, but 10 to 15 people were hurt. Some of those injured had already been treated and released. Most of the injured were described as “minor to moderate” by Dr. Theresa Brennan with the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, with conditions that needed treatment including burns, trauma, and cuts and scrapes. One patient was classified by Brennan as falling into the more serious end of the spectrum of injuries in their procedures for a “mass casualty event.” Family members with questions about loved ones may call UIHC at (319) 356-1616 for more information. UIHC officials said that they were standing by until the fire was extinguished. Several medical helicopters were initially dispatched to the scene, along with multiple fire departments. Officials evacuated several nearby homes and are urging people to avoid being outside due to the smoke. The evacuation was lifted for the affected homes around 7:00 p.m. on Thursday, though residents were still told to stay away from the area of South Street and the Iowa County Fairgrounds due to the fire. The fire was proving difficult to extinguish, according to officials, due to the materials in the plant. Firefighters were using foam to try and douse the flames. KCCI reports staff with Iowa Valley Community School District said the district is not impacted. They have not evacuated or canceled classes. The City of Marengo said that water in the city may have a brown color to it on Thursday due to the excess water usage by firefighters. The facility has been owned by Heartland Crush since 2017.

Posted in Sports | News (Radio Iowa) – The Iowa Supreme Court has ordered a new trial in a Black Hawk County case that involves the “stand your ground” law. Lasondra Johnson of Waterloo was charged with first-degree murder after a fight that led to Johnson shooting and killing Jada Young-Mills. Johnson was acquitted of first-degree murder after claiming self defense, but was found guilty of a lesser charge of assault causing serious injury. Johnson appealed, saying the jury instructions were confusing. The Supreme Court agreed, saying the jury instructions did fail to convey the “stand your ground” law in such a way that the jury had a clear understanding of Johnson’s self defense justification, and ordered a new trial. Posted in News | News (Radio Iowa) – Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird says a 17-month-long review has found serious problems in state services for crime victims. Bird says she was shocked to learn the system to notify victims when a protective order is being served or is about to expire was terminated in 2019 by her predecessor, Democrat Tom Miller. Bird has hired a coordinator to revive the notification system. Bird’s report indicates a separate system that notifies victims when their abuser will be released from custody has been fixed. Bird says it was causing fear and panic in victims because it incorrectly sent notices about transfers from jail to jail or to a state prison. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird spoke to reporters today during a news conference in her Des Moines office. (RI photo) Bird announced today (Friday) she’ll be using money in her agency’s budget to double the pay for Iowa nurses who conduct sexual assault exams — and she hopes that encourages more nurses to take the training that’s required. For the first time, the Iowa nurses authorized to conduct sexual assault exams will get mileage reimbursed, too. Bird, who was elected in 2022, stopped state reimbursement for emergency contraception for sex abuse victims soon after she took office in early 2023 and she’s released that hold today (Friday). Bird says no tax dollars will be used, but instead fees and fines criminals pay into the state’s victim compensation fund will cover the costs. It’s the same policy that was in place before she took office for Plan B. Bird will no longer allow victim funds to cover the costs of an abortion for sexual assault victims. In response, State Auditor Rob Sand, today (Friday) said in a statement: “For a year, Iowa’s Attorney General inflicted even more trauma on'}]"

Ag/Outdoor, News (Radio Iowa) – Out of state visitors at two western Iowa parks will have to keep paying an entrance fee for at least two and a half more years. Lake Manawa State Park in Council Bluffs had three million visitors last year and Representative Brent Siegrist, of Council Bluffs, says the fee may be a way to thin the crowds. “Lake Manawa is the most heavily used park in the state park system, particularly because it’s next to Omaha and there are tons of Nebraskans that come over,” Siegrist says. “…Waubonsie State Park also is down near the Missouri border in Fremont County and they have a lot of traffic and visitors there.” In 2019, the legislature authorized an entrance fee of five dollars per out-of-state vehicle at both parks. It was a pilot project, to see if visitor traffic would change. “The COVID years dramatically affected those parks at that time,” Siegrist says, “so they didn’t have a particularly good read about whether this is something they wanted to extend into the future.” This week Governor Reynolds approved the bill that keeps the fee in place until the end of 2025. Senator Dan Dawson of Council Bluffs says the fee can be a tool for keeping the peace in the park that’s just 10 miles from Omaha. “When they have a crowd coming over to our parks to use it for purposes that you and I or anyone else here might not enjoy to take our families there and just enjoy the day — whether they want to drink or tear up the park or go off-road or so something like that, this is one more tool to try to maybe redirect some of our non-residents back to their state,” Dawson says. There’s a daily fee for every vehicle entering a NEBRASKA state park. It’s six dollars for Nebraskans and eight dollars for everyone else. The State of Iowa began charging a 10-dollar yearly park user fee in 1987, but it was repealed two years later. During debate of the continued entrance fees for Lake Manawa and Waubonsie State Parks, legislators said they were not interested in imposing entrance fees at the other 81 state parks and recreation areas in Iowa.

Those damages primarily consisted of residential properties that were affected by falling limbs, trees, or high winds. Currently, (63) structures have been impacted by the severe weather event along with a few parks & recreation areas receiving some form of tree damage, debris, or other related minor damages.” “The important numbers right now,” Reed said, “are that there have been zero injuries or fatalities related to this storm event and nearly all utility outages have been restored. This nighttime tornado scenario is one of the ones that scares me the most; nearly everyone is home, and nearly everyone is asleep.” Reed reminds everyone that you need to have multiple ways to receive warning alerts. “Have a weather radio, sign up for our free emergency and weather alerts, and leave those device’s volumes turned on during the night – there’s simply no other solution.” Damage reports from the public will be accepted over the next couple of days as officials continue to assess the overall impact and potential need for assistance.
