Environmental Quality is on track to approve an air pollution permit for a $1 billion petrochemical plant in Geismar, which would be the world’s largest plastics plant of its kind. Mitsubishi Chemical Co. plans to build a $1 billion facility on a 77-acre site in Geismar that’s capable of producing 385,000 tons annually of methyl methacrylate (MMA), a chemical used in a variety of paints, adhesives, building panels and other acrylic polymers. The company is asking LDEQ for a permit that would allow the plant to emit hundreds of tons of toxic gasses, as well as nearly 781,000 tons of greenhouse gas per year. It would rank the plant among the state’s top 50 pollution emitters, according to data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Located along the Mississippi River in Ascension Parish, Geismar is within the so-called “Cancer Alley” petrochemical corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that has among the worst air quality and highest rates of cancer in the country. More than 5,000 residents live within a three-mile radius of the proposed Mitsubishi plant, and they are already surrounded by a number of petrochemical plants such as those owned by BASF, Occidental Chemical Corp, Shell Chemical, Rubicon, Westlake Chemical and Air Products. In a notice requesting comments from the public regarding whether or not to grant the air permit, LDEQ stated that the project is not “expected to have a significant adverse impact on soil, vegetation, visibility, or air quality in the area of the facility.” Some Ascension Parish residents and environmental activists disagree. They voiced opposition at a public hearing LDEQ held recently and disseminated statements to reporters afterwards. Pamela Ambeau, who lives in Ascension Parish and helps run the local environmental group Rural Roots Louisiana, said the Mitsubishi facility would add air pollution to an area already overloaded with petrochemical plant emissions. “The air here is already so dirty that the kids can’t play outside anymore,” Ambeau said in a statement. “I just can’t believe they’re trying to build another toxic plant right on top of us. It makes me furious, and I know it makes my neighbors and family members just as furious, too. That’s why we’re telling LDEQ loud and clear that Mitsubishi is not welcome here, and that we’re not going to stop until this plant is gone and our kids can play outside again.” Former Gov. John Bel Edwards helped bring Mitsubishi to the state back by offering a $4 million grant and access to lucrative incentives such as the Industrial Tax Exemption Program (ITEP) and Quality Jobs tax credit program. The company has qualified for roughly $168 million in ITEP incentives over a 10-year period from Ascension Parish taxpayers. The project is expected to have an economic impact of over $1 billion and create 125 permanent jobs with an average annual salary of $100,000, according to a Louisiana Economic Development statement from Dec. 8, 2020. The Geismar plant would be Mitsubishi’s third globally that produces MMA using ethylene, a chemical synthesized from natural gas. The company’s only other MMA-producing site in the U.S. is in Memphis but uses older technologies. The company said its newer technology has a “significantly lower carbon footprint.” “The Geismar project would be the third and largest commercial application of (Mitsubishi’s) proprietary Alpha technology, which was first deployed in 2008,” company executive Hitoshi Sasaki said. “This technology and plant design are perfectly matched for the shale gas-based feedstock slate in the United States, and strengthens our global leadership in the MMA merchant market.” LDEQ is expected to grant the air permit this year, and construction could begin as early as 2025. — The Louisiana Illuminator is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization driven by its mission to cast light on how decisions are made in Baton Rouge and how they affect the lives of everyday Louisianians, particularly those who are poor or otherwise marginalized.'}]"

Steven Udvarhelyi, President and Chief Executive Officer of BCBSLA, makes a statement during the state senate committee on Blue Cross Blue Shield Louisiana on Monday, February 5, 2024 at the state capitol building in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. State legislators issued a critical report Thursday on the proposed $2.5 billion sale of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana to Indiana-based Elevance Health, questioning the fairness of the deal\'s regulatory and voting process, among other issues, on the same day that Louisiana\'s powerful hospital association voiced its own opposition. The report, sent by legislators to Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple, was issued ahead of a two-day regulatory hearing next week during which Blue Cross will make its case for why the deal should move forward. Concerns over the acquisition of the Louisiana-based health insurer have built in recent weeks as state legislators raised questions about how it will affect health insurance premiums and whether the process to approve the deal is fair. On Thursday, the Louisiana Hospital Association, which represents hospitals and health care systems across the state, came out publicly against the sale, at least for now, urging that Temple not approve the deal until an independent evaluation of Elevance’s activities in other states could be completed. The association also suggested several safeguards the commission could impose to make the deal more palatable. State Treasurer Dr. John Fleming, a practicing physician, also said he opposed the deal, arguing that health insurance premiums will have to rise to make the deal worthwhile for Elevance. ""We have been committed to addressing the concerns of others, and that is why we delayed our transaction last year and have taken time to both listen to and talk with various stakeholders,"" Blue Cross said in a statement from spokesperson Cindy Wakefield Thursday evening. ""We remain committed to working with the Louisiana Department of Insurance on their review of the transaction, including our participation in the public hearing next week."" The company also defended the proxy voting process it is using and the third-party firms that are gathering proxy votes. More generally, Blue Cross CEO Dr. Steve Udvarhelyi in recent weeks has defended the sale, saying that while the insurer is financially strong, it is losing out to big national competitors, especially in its most profitable service lines. Blue Cross has said it will be better able to serve customers in the future and slow rising health care costs if it sells now to a larger company with better digital tools, telehealth platforms and its own pharmacy benefits manager. In a prepared statement, Elevance suggested that the committee report and the comments from Fleming were ""misinformation about the agreement"" and said that the state shouldn\'t let special interests stand in the way of the improved health care and services that a deal would bring. ""The record is clear: Elevance Health is a trusted source of health coverage to more than 47 million people across the country,"" said the statement from Elevance spokesperson Leslie Porras. While elected officials and hospital executives have influential voices, they don’t have legal authority over the deal. Approval power rests with Temple and some 92,000 Blue Cross policyholders with voting rights in the mutual, or member-owned, company. Two-thirds of those policyholders, about 3% of the 1.9 million people in Louisiana covered by a Blue Cross insurance plan, must approve the deal. Critics of the deal fear that a for-profit company will raise customer premiums and cut reimbursement rates to doctors and hospitals in order to satisfy shareholders. They\'ve also questioned the split of sale proceeds between a new foundation, known as the Accelerate Louisiana Initiative, and policyholders, and the focus areas of the foundation, which were revised late last year at the urging of then-Gov.-elect Jeff Landry. In the report Thursday to the Department of Insurance, state senators focused on concerns about the way Blue Cross is conducting the proxy voting, a process that began earlier this month and must be concluded by Feb. 19. The report accuses the company of “vote steering,” arguing that policyholders are not receiving any unbiased information about the sale in the information packets they are receiving from Blue Cross. Policyholders will receive a $3,000 payment if the deal is approved. The report also raises questions that came to light at the legislative hearing Monday about the calls a third-party consultant hired by Blue Cross is making to policyholders. “The voting process has been tainted by egregious vote steering intimidation and enticement methods,” said a letter accompanying the report and signed by the five Republican and three Democratic members of the Health and Welfare Committee. The report also accused the company of “ballot influence techniques,” because proxy ballots show the “vote for” option in large, boldface type, while the “against’ option is in a much smaller font. Louisiana Department of Insurance officials, who said they were not aware of the calls until Monday’s hearing, confirmed they are looking into the matter to determine “whether Blue Cross conducted the voting in accordance with acceptable proxy voting practices for corporate transactions and in accordance with state law.” Blue Cross spokesperson Cindy Wakefield said in written comments late Thursday that Blue Cross stands by the use of a proxy solicitation firm, ""a routine procedure in proxy votes by companies across the nation."" Wakefield said consultants MacKenzie Partners is soliciting and collecting proxies and that two other independent firms — American Election Services and EisnerAmper — will audit and inspect proxies and ballots submitted in person and the company\'s policyholder meeting later this month. An Insurance Commission spokesman said Temple has wide discretion in regulating the voting process, but declined to discuss what might happen if the commission found ballots and phone solicitations sought to unfairly bias policyholders in favor of the deal. The Louisiana Hospital Association’s letter to the Insurance Commission raised a different set of concerns about the deal that also came to light during Monday’s testimony — the more than $26 million in fines Elevance Health has racked up since 2019 from state and federal regulators. Most of those fines were for denying claims for mostly Medicaid customers and failing to reimburse providers in a timely fashion. Blue Cross has previously said it looked into fines and lawsuits against the company and that they were not out of line compared to other large, national insurers. The LHA asked Temple not to approve the deal until he has done an independent market evaluation of the company focusing on its track record in other states. It also suggests several conditions Temple could impose on Elevance, in the event he approves the deal. Those conditions include: allowing policyholders to pursue an independent claims review process if they’re denied coverage and requiring that Elevance seek approval from the insurance department before making changes to the doctors and hospitals in its network. Elevance did not respond to a request seeking comment about those recommendations. Email Stephanie Riegel at stephanie.riegel@theadvocate.com.

2024. (Photo by Chris Granger, The Times-Picayune) Gov. Jeff Landry confirmed Tuesday that he sought a revised plan for the Accelerate Louisiana Initiative — the $3 billion foundation that will be formed if Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana is successfully sold to Elevance Health — that bars research money from going to the state\'s colleges and universities. The plans for the foundation, which were changed late last year as Blue Cross sought approval from state regulators for the deal for a second time, now specifically prohibit research money for health outcomes from going to higher educational institutions — except for the LSU-affiliated Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge. Landry said that giving the money to other Louisiana research institutions, a list that would include LSU and Tulane University, would be wasteful. “I don’t want money going to higher education. I want the money used in our workforce because everywhere I go, people are telling me they don’t have skilled labor. And I’ve seen these deals around the country and all the money gets sucked up by the universities and we got nothing,” Landry said. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, left center, talks with the media on his way out from the Jefferson Chamber annual meeting at the Alario Center in Westwego on Tuesday, February 6, 2024. (Photo by Chris Granger, The Times-Picayune) The remarks shed new light on why Blue Cross officials made revisions to their plans for Accelerate Louisiana as they seek approval later this month from state insurance regulators and Blue Cross policyholders. During a nearly eight-hour hearing on the deal on Monday, state lawmakers raised questions regarding the specific language about Pennington and why they were singled out for potential funding. Accelerate Louisiana Board Chair and Acting President Tim Barfield said the idea behind the stipulation was to deploy money as quickly as possible on solutions to problems that have long been studied. “This was a big deal to him, and we’ve done a lot of research and kind of know what to do about these chronic health problems,” said Barfield, who said he met with Landry to discuss the foundation both before and after his election last fall. “He wanted to make sure this money would be used in the best way for Louisiana. He was very adamant about how we are we going to narrow this down. We narrowed down where the foundation should focus early on.” The language, which is included in information packets sent to Blue Cross policyholders who will be voting on the proposed sale of the company, is not legally binding and Barfield said it is “high level” and still needs to be fleshed out in detail. Still, it would appear to be a blow to other research institutions in the state, including LSU and Tulane, which have been supportive of the foundation. It\'s not clear if they could receive foundation money for other initiatives not related specifically to health outcomes, such as workforce development. Tulane President Michael Fitts has twice posted letters to the Department of Insurance website urging regulators to approve the sale to Elevance in part because of the good Accelerate Louisiana can do for the state. Tulane and LSU declined to comment Tuesday. Blue Cross announced its proposed acquisition by Elevance last year, arguing that while it is currently financially stable, a sale to the much larger Elevance would offer a more secure future, provide greater services to its 1.8 million customers and help it compete with other large national health insurers. Landry opposed the deal when it first went before regulators last fall. As Louisiana attorney general and a front runner in the governor’s race, he questioned how it would impact consumers and also how the foundation money would be spent. His pressure, along with pointed questions from lawmakers, concerns from doctors group and other opposition, led Blue Cross to temporarily shelve the deal. In the meantime, Landry began meeting with Barfield and others to discuss the proposal, according to Barfield. Following his election, the company refiled its plans to sell to Elevance, and while there were few changes to the terms of the deal, the plans for Accelerate Louisiana were significantly modified. Tim Barfield, representing Accelerate Louisiana, talks about the foundation being set up during the state senate committee on Blue Cross Blue Shield Louisiana on Monday, February 5, 2024 at the state capitol building in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Under the new plan, Landry will be able to appoint one of the foundation\'s board seats. Moreover, revised documents spelled out four focus areas for the foundation: helping Louisianans move from dependence to independence; improving health outcomes by addressing chronic illnesses; healthcare workforce development; and making government work more efficiently. Barfield said the document was a compromise between Landry and the foundation. “In all these discussions I have become convinced that he is trying to do what he thinks is best for Louisiana and I agree with a lot of it,” Barfield said. In his remarks Tuesday, Landry said what is best for Louisiana is “to move people off the Medicaid roll and onto private insurance, because when we do that, guess what, the people are happier, they’re making more money. We’re building a better middle class.” The governor’s remarks, similar to those he made in a speech about the foundation last week to the Louisiana Hospital Association, were concerning to some advocates for the state’s low-income population. Jan Moller of the Louisiana Budget Project has been critical of the foundation’s decision to give appointment power of a seat on the foundation board to the governor. “Our concerns about the foundation have always been that it not become a political entity that serves the ideology of the governor,” Moller said. “It shouldn’t be looking to take Medicaid coverage away from people."" Pennington Biomedical Research Center Executive Director Dr. John Kirwan said he didn’t know why Pennington had been singled out to be eligible for foundation money and said he was not aware of any Pennington board members that had lobbied for it. “But I can understand why they would select us because we are focused on health outcomes and are world renowned institution so if you are going to put resources toward something, it would make sense to put it toward us,” he said. Barfield said because of Pennington’s track record in diabetes and obesity research, it made sense to involve them in the foundation’s early efforts towards solving the state’s chronic health problems. “(The governor) didn’t demand Pennington be included but it was sort of a natural evolution because they’re a world-class institution,” Barfield said.

and maggots after sitting fused to a couch for years pleaded no contest to manslaughter on Monday, 20th Judicial District Court District Attorney Sam D\'Aquilla said. Lacey Fletcher, 36, was found dead Jan. 3, 2022, in her family’s home in Slaughter. She was sunken into a waste-filled crater in her family’s living room couch, covered in maggots and sores, had several ulcers on her underside and fecal matter crushed into her face, chest and abdomen, according to authorities. Clay and Sheila Fletcher, Lacey Fletcher\'s parents, were originally arrested and indicted on second-degree murder charges in May 2022 in their daughter\'s death. A judge later tossed the charges after their attorneys raised questions about defective language in the charging affidavits. An East Feliciana Parish grand jury re-indicted the parents in June 2023. The Fletchers initially maintained their innocence, insisting their daughter was ""of sound mind"" and chose to not leave the living room. They claimed they brought her food and set up a potty, but she was afraid to leave the couch. Lacey Fletcher was diagnosed with social anxiety and had a history of “severe” Asperger’s, a lifelong condition known to leave patients with maladjusted social skills, authorities noted. The District Attorney\'s Office will request the maximum sentence of 40 years, D\'Aquilla said. “We want to stand for children, elderly and infirm persons that cannot speak for themselves and bring attention to these situations to prevent further abuse, mistreatment or neglect,” D’Aquilla said. “We consider letting a person under your care custody and control deteriorate to the point that her untreated wounds exposed her bones a very serious crime and the penalty should be life imprisonment.“ A sentencing hearing is set for March 20.

The good news: For the third consecutive year, you can bet on Sunday’s Super Bowl from either in a casino, or off your couch, as casino sports betting has been offered since 2021 and online sports betting has been legal in Louisiana since 2022. You will be one of 67.8 million Americans expected to bet on Super Bowl LVIII between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs, a 35% increase from 2023.

The bad news: there are currently no Taylor Swift props available in Louisiana on Caesars, FanDuel, BetMGM, DraftKings, and/or ESPNBet. You would have to be in Canada and on FanDuel to bet if Travis Kelce will propose to Taylor Swift (10 to 1 odds), Swift’s shirt color (red is the heavy favorite), and/or will Swift and Kelce be shown on TV kissing (also, likely yes, according to sportsbooks).

On FanDuel, you can parlay the winner of the PGA’s Phoenix Open and the Super Bowl MVP.

women’s basketball junior guard Aneesah Morrow (24) goes up for the basket Thursday, Jan. 25, 2024, during LSU’s 76-70 loss against South Carolina in the Pete Maravich Assembly Center in Baton Rouge, La. Twenty rebounds, 28 minutes. Aneesah Morrow is LSU’s second leading scorer and its most versatile player. The Tigers needed to get back in the winner’s column, and they were able to do so with a 106-66 win over Florida on Sunday afternoon. The 6-foot-1 athlete transferred into the program from DePaul. Already, Morrow has become LSU\'s difference maker. The program is headlined by its big three: Angel Reese, Flau\'jae Johnson and Hailey Van Lith. However, its most valuable player might not be among these names. Morrow has been the best contributor for the Tigers. Between being responsible for 24.6% of the team’s total defensive takeaways and having the second most points per game, Morrow has been LSU’s swiss army knife. She averages a double-double, with 17.2 points per game and 10 rebounds per game; however, her value might not be in just her production, as she is able to play almost any position on the court. The Tigers have so much success because of two things: the amount of depth on their roster, and their ability to change lineups. Head coach Kim Mulkey has fashioned several highly productive lineups based on Morrow’s versatility alone. When Reese moves to center, Morrow moves to forward, with Mikaylah Williams, Johnson and Van Lith filling in the rest. However, if the Tigers need to roll out a big offense, they can put Aalyah Del Rosario at the five, move Reese to the four, Morrow at the three, then Williams and Johnson filling in at the one and two. In some instances, the Tigers have moved her to guard, her position listed on ESPN, for select lineups. This gives the program a competitive edge, allowing them to create more advantageous matchups. The bottom-line is that regardless of position, Morrow will produce. In fact, in her last five games, she has been the most productive player on the roster. Against Florida, Morrow had 20 total rebounds in only 28 minutes, finishing the game with three less total rebounds than the entire Florida team. Her glass control gave the Tigers a defensive and offensive boost alike. The 13 defensive rebounds prevented more shots, while the seven offensive rebounds gave the Tigers more opportunities to score. In the end, her efforts led the Tigers to a 106-66 blowout over the Gators. Even in losses, Morrow is a major producer. Against Mississippi State, Morrow finished with 14 points, six rebounds and six steals. Her six steals gave the Tigers a defensive edge that helped keep the game close. While she shot only 33.3% from the field, Morrow still helped boost the team with her defensive presence. She’s such a valuable player because if she struggles in one area, she can excel in the other, helping her stay consistently good. Against South Carolina, however, Morrow was more than just good. The Gamecocks had no answer for her. She finished the game with 16 points, which was 21.5% of the winning score and 22.9% of LSU’s total points. Moreover, Morrow was efficient when scoring, as she shot 63.6% from the field and 100% from the three, and was a defensive presence with 10 rebounds and four defensive takeaways. She scored from every level on the court: The paint, mid-range and three. Although ultimately the Tigers lost, Morrow proved that she is just as much an offensive threat as anyone else on the roster. Against Arkansas, Morrow once again filled up the box score in a blowout. She was responsible for 14 points, shooting 55.6% from the field, eight rebounds and a season high four assists. Shooting well from the field and good passes helped raise the Tigers\' offensive efficiency, which led to the blowout. Morrow showed she has more to her game than just defense, proving she’s capable of facilitating the Tigers offense. In fact, one game prior to Arkansas, Morrow showed once again her ability as a scorer. Against Alabama, she finished with 20 points, while shooting 40% from the field. On top of this, she also had 12 rebounds and three steals. LSU’s AP Top 25 ranking went down four spots after losing to Mississippi State last Monday. It is now ranked No. 13, its lowest ranking all season. Morrow tends to thrive against tough competition. The same way she played well against South Carolina is the same way she played against Alabama, the sixth-ranked school in the SEC. Morrow has had success in every area on the court this season. While this five-game stretch shows how valuable she is to the Tigers, her best offensive performance was undoubtedly against Virginia. She finished the game with 37 points, while shooting 60% from the field, and had 16 rebounds. The Tigers narrowly won 76-73 with Morrow being responsible for 48.7% of the team\'s total points. Morrow might not be the first option offensively for the Tigers, however she’s more than capable of being the program\'s difference maker. She was a proven scorer at DePaul; with opposing teams having to focus on Reese, Williams, Johnson and Van Lith, Morrow will continue to get plenty of opportunities to score. That, along with how she performs against tougher competition, gives LSU a competitive edge, and could lead to her being the program\'s difference maker in the postseason. It was a big weekend for LSU basketball as both programs bounced back with blowout wins. Contributing Sports Reporter If you\'re interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor, click here.

For the second year in a row, the Doomsday Clock has been set – by scientists analyzing the dangers faced by Planet Earth due to human exploitation and nuclear-armed geopolitics – at 90 seconds to midnight. In other words, be afraid. Be very afraid. The dangers include ongoing nuclear-weapons development by both major and minor national powers, combined with the planet’s current slaughter-wars –in Ukraine, Palestine and elsewhere – and the ever-looming possibility that they could go nuclear. In other words, human civilization’s collective thinking remains trapped in an us-vs.-them modality. One of the weirdest aspects of this that the Bulletin cited was the fact that artificial intelligence has begun assuming control of our fate: “Military uses of AI are accelerating. Extensive use of AI is already occurring in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, simulation, and training. Of particular concern are lethal autonomous weapons, which identify and destroy targets without human intervention. Decisions to put AI in control of important physical systems—in particular, nuclear weapons—could indeed pose a direct existential threat to humanity.” Join me as I let loose a child’s scream of terror and disbelief. And of course this is all combined with the planet’s ongoing climate collapse. As the Bulletin pointed out, 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded, greenhouse gas emissions are still on the rise, the ice is still melting in Antarctica and . . . uh, we’re not addressing this with any effectiveness. You know, we’re still too busy playing war and exploiting what’s left of the planet’s resources. This is how human civilization has organized itself – and nothing can change it, right? That seems to be the attitude of much of the media, which largely contextualizes the news it brings us in a mainstream shrug. Climate collapse? Nuclear war and global annihilation? That’s way too complicated to write about. Come on, we’ve got an election coming up. Us vs. them! This, at any rate, is what occurred to me when I read a story in the Washington Post the other day, which kept trying to make the point that the country is collapsing into what it called “tribalism,” that is, left-vs.-rightism, with both sides equally convinced of their rectitude and equally snarky toward the other guys. Both sides – get it? When the corporate media serves us politics this way, it displays its (centrist) “objectivity,” which, as far as it’s concerned, is simply reality and not something to be critically analyzed. The problem, according to centrist analysis, is that the country is getting more and more polarized, both politically and culturally. On one side you’ve got Trump and the MAGA Republicans. On the other side, you’ve got Bernie Sanders supporters. Pretty scary! The USA has never been this divided, the story notes, apparently failing to remember slavery, Jim Crow lynchings, race-separated bathrooms and such. What was most unsettling to me about the story, however, was its pulling in several social scientists who explained the nature of evolution to us. While, yes, human beings learned to work together over the millennia and created self-sustaining communities, a.k.a., tribes, the “evolution of cooperation required out-group hatred,” according to a Yale sociologist. In other words, there could be no “us” without a “them” lurking just around the bend – not simply different from us but scary, threatening and no doubt evil. While the Post story had no connection whatsoever to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and its 90-seconds-to-midnight global prognosis, I felt a shrug of indifference toward it nonetheless, in that it remained quietly caged in the us-vs.-them mindset that makes human collective thinking and, oh my God, geopolitical cooperation a cynical joke. That ain’t gonna happen. War is inevitable. So is our trillion-dollar military budget. Any questions? My primary question is this: How dare you shrug at the Doomsday Clock, at the looming inevitability of climate collapse, at the ongoing expansion of nukes and the ultimate certainty of nuclear war . . . if nothing changes? We are capable of larger thinking than this! That’s the ultimate message of the Atomic Scientists, and for corroboration I turn to World Beyond War, which makes the point the very essence of evolution is the expansion of our thinking to embrace ever-larger realities of cooperation, connection and understanding. And not only that, killing our fellow human beings is not the simplistic result of what our DNA tells us to do but a political creation of the last several millennia that is anything but universally accepted. “According to myth, war is ‘natural,’” a World Beyond War essay points out: “Yet a great deal of conditioning is needed to prepare most people to take part in war, and a great deal of mental suffering is common among those who have taken part. . . . “. . . (We) need to understand war as the cultural creation that it is and stop imagining it as something imposed on us by forces beyond our control. . . .In fact, war is not required by a particular lifestyle or standard of living because any lifestyle can be changed, because unsustainable practices must end by definition with or without war, and because war actually impoverishes societies that use it.” In other words, war isn’t the result of evolution but sheerly the unevolved aspect of who we are. Humanity did “evolve with habits of cooperation and altruism,” and in so doing created communities of connection and trans-individual support. And yes, any community has an edge, beyond which looms the unknown. But as we encounter the unknown, we needn’t see it, simplistically, as “the enemy,” but rather as part of a larger community, which requires larger understanding. Our need to understand never stops.

He provided an overview of the board’s achievements in the past three years and outlined their aspirations for the school system in 2024. During the first three years of Byler’s leadership, the school board has had to be reactive to challenges thrown at the school system, such as COVID, two hurricanes, lifting morale, and a new school board. The new challenges that the school system faces in 2024, Byler explained, include the latest charter school effects, a certified teacher shortage, the ending of ESSER funding, upgrading facilities, and the safety of employees and students. “We have had to be reactive and deal with hurricanes and COVID,” Byler said after the meeting. “The obstacles we have had to deal with, we have overcome them. We now have to begin moving forward into the new era.” The new era could significantly change the statewide school system, Byler said. One of those changes could be the “School Choice Program,” which could be on the horizon in the near future with the new governor, Jeff Landry. The program lets parents choose a school to allow their child to thrive. That choice could mean the child attending a private school or homeschool. “We have to do the best we can and not worry about the changes around us,” said Byler. “We have done some great things but will not sit on our hands. We will continue to look for what is best for the district.” He added that the “Vision 2024” report was to show the school board that, under Byler’s leadership, the school system has been fiscally responsible over the last three years. The school system’s pay scale has increased over the last three years, either with a 13th check or a change of the pay scale for everyone. Byler explained that projects still need to be completed in 2024, such as hurricane projects at a few schools, upgrading school facilities, and finishing spending ESSER money. Also, tops on the school board’s “to-do” list in 2024 is to figure out why the insurance fund is losing money. In 2023, the insurance fund finished with a $2 million deficit. 318 N.

Google Gemini is an evolution of Google Bard and promises to deliver sparks although, for the moment at least, it is better to proceed by pulling the handbrake of expectations.

Gemini Advanced leverages the Ultra 1.0 language model which, according to Google, is capable of increasing the complexity of the tasks that generative AI can solve, because it is equipped with a more refined and snappy “logical reasoning”. All this reverberates on the creation of content, on the ability to write code (portions of software) and on the possibility of integrating Gemini into Gmail and into documents created with the Google Workspace suite, Big G’s alternative to the well-known parallel Microsoft Office suite. The most interesting thing is that Gemini supports longer and more complex prompts, i.e. accepts instructions more detailed and this opens the doors to a more fierce challenge to direct competitors, especially to ChatGPT which, after a period crackling between the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023, it attracted fewer and fewer users and showed even worrying limits on which the news often focused, as in the case of the New York lawyer who used it to write a speech discovering then that the Chatbot had invented previous sentences and legal references or, perhaps even worse, as in the case of complaints for copyright infringement. Starting with the advantages, Google Gemini Advanced has a cost of 21.99 euros per month (it can be tried for free for two months) and also includes 2 TB of space on the Cloud. The cost is similar to that of Copilot Pro (22 euros per month), the premium version from Microsoft, which promises to be able to surpass in effectiveness and productivity. In short, more capacity (and 2 Terabytes of Cloud storage) at the same price, a sign of a challenge that also unfolds on the commercial. The disadvantages, which are only hypothetical for the moment, may become apparent as time passes. In fact, at the end of 2023, Google showed off Gemini’s capabilities, but committed the error of having mystified reality a bit: it is true – as Google itself demonstrates – that Gemini has given results of a certain level, but distorting the comparison with ChatGPT a bit.

1:37 pm Wednesday, February 7, 2024 By Staff Reports BY JEFF CROUERE COLUMNIST The tenure of Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel must immediately end. Sadly, the RNC is in horrible shape as it prepares for a crucial presidential election year. Last week, the 2023 fundraising totals were released for both major political parties. The RNC only raised $87.2 million, compared to $119.9 million raised by the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Whereas the RNC had only $8 million in cash at the end of 2023, with a $1.8 million outstanding debt, the DNC touted a bank balance of $21 million with zero debt. These results were the worst for the GOP in a decade and significantly less than the $241.1 million raised in 2019, the last financial report preceding a presidential election year. Even with the huge fundraising totals in 2019, the RNC was not prepared for the Democratic Party’s antics in the 2020 election. With such anemic fundraising totals this year, how can the RNC possibly defend against a better funded DNC, which also has the support of the mainstream news media, Big Tech, special interest groups, the Deep State, unions, Hollywood as well as a myriad of other advantages? To make matters worse, the Democratic Party’s congressional committees outraised their Republican counterparts by $26 million in 2023. The online fundraising battle was also won by Democrats, as their non-profit political action committee outraised the online Republican organization by a whopping $323.2 million in 2023. These are devastating totals for Republicans, who should be poised for victory after the disastrous tenure of President Joe Biden. Instead, the GOP is in serious trouble only nine months before the 2024 election, which will determine control of both the White House and Congress. These numbers show that Republican donors have lost confidence in the party’s establishment, especially with Chairwoman McDaniel. In an interview on Fox News yesterday, former President Donald Trump expressed his frustration, predicting that there will “probably be some changes made” at the RNC. He said that McDaniel did “OK initially,” but that today “people are not looking at the RNC. They want changes.” While Trump noted he has “nothing to do with the RNC, I’m separate,” their actions have created challenges for his campaign. The RNC wanted all candidates to sign a loyalty pledge to support the party’s presidential nominee, which Trump refused to sign. In addition, the RNC sponsored numerous televised presidential debates, including one hosted by a very liberal network, NBC. Of course, former President Trump, who has always enjoyed a huge lead among Republican candidates, refused to participate. Unfortunately, the RNC gave a televised platform for several of the candidates, such as former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, to ridicule Trump, the Republican Party’s leader, and massive frontrunner. All these actions were a distraction from defeating Biden, which should have been the only focus of the party. The RNC’s questionable decisions and the GOP’s poor election results have led some GOP leaders, such as Vivek Ramaswamy, to call for the resignation of Chairwoman McDaniel. During a GOP presidential debate, Ramaswamy called on McDaniel to “come on stage” and resign. He claimed the GOP had become “a party of losers.” He said once McDaniel “took over as chairwoman of the RNC in 2017, we have lost 2018, 2020, 2022, no red wave, that never came.” Ramaswamy also complained that the GOP was “trounced” in the 2023 elections. In January, Ramaswamy posted on social media that there needed to be “accountability” for the Republican Party’s losses and that “Grassroots conservatives across the nation are joining me to end the culture of surrender and losing. Resign, Ronna.” Will McDaniel be forced to resign? After her interview with former President Trump, Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo stated that “I think that there will be changes made in the Republican National Committee very soon.” Hopefully, this prediction will come true, for the party is in serious trouble. At the recently concluded RNC annual meeting in Las Vegas, the party’s bleak financial situation was disclosed to members. After reviewing the troubling report, the Arizona RNC National Committeeman Tyler Bowyer disclosed to Just the News that the Republican Party is in “a bad financial situation.” He said that 2023 was “the lowest year of fundraising in 30 years for the RNC.” With higher fundraising totals in previous years, Bowyer said that the GOP “still didn’t win.” With such dreadful fundraising ahead of the 2024 election. Bowyer maintained that the “grassroots is rightfully concerned.” Bowyer is also troubled that the party is spending too much on “overhead” and not enough on “get-out-the-vote efforts.” His viewpoint was corroborated by a recent report by Jennifer Van Laar of RedState. She analyzed spending by the RNC and DNC in several categories. The RNC outspent their DNC competitors in these types of expenditures: flowers, limousines, office supplies, donor gifts, media consulting and management consulting. Such frivolous spending on perks and extravagancies does not win elections. In contrast, the DNC outspent the RNC in vital areas such as payroll, voter file maintenance, Get Out the Vote (GOTV) texting and transfers to state parties. With such abysmal spending priorities and incompetent leadership, it is no surprise that a growing number of Republican donors and grassroots activists are refusing to support the RNC. For victory in 2024, Trump and all Republican candidates need new leadership at the RNC immediately. The stakes are too high for this type of negligence to continue. Unfortunately, if no changes are made, the Democrats will have another massive advantage, coupled with their already formidable advantages, to achieve victory in another election cycle. In 2024, the Republicans have the right candidate, the right policies, and historic enthusiasm from the grassroots level, while the Democrats are led by the worst President in American history. Nonetheless, if the party apparatus is not well funded and equipped to battle for every vote, it will be another disappointing night in November, and the consequences for the country will be too unspeakable to contemplate.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 4:00 pm NEW ORLEANS — It’s not Easter, but bunnies are everywhere in various New Orleans parks. In the past four months, rabbit rescuers James and Sherri Johnson have helped rescue more than 50 bunnies in City Park, Lafreniere Park and Kenner Park. According to Johnson and the Humane Society of Louisiana (HSLA), people are buying or receiving rabbits as gifts and then deciding they don’t want them. Rather than turning them over to their local shelter or re-homing them, they are abandoning them in city parks. Given that the rabbits are domestic and cannot survive in the wild for very long, the results are often tragic. “Our city parks have become a dumping ground,” Johnson said. “It’s illegal to dump any domesticated animal, and domesticated bunnies are the third-most dumped animal behind dogs and cats. City park employees need to discourage abandonment and notify law enforcement agencies of all violations. We need to stop this.” Johnson and his wife, who runs the nonprofit Lola & Friends Bunny Rescue of South Mississippi, have been helping in the New Orleans Area because he gets tagged in so many Facebook posts about bunnies being found in parks. Johnson works closely with Jefferson SPCA and Avian and Exotic Animal Hospital of Louisiana which spays and neuters the bunnies and vets them before Johnson and the Jefferson SPCA attempt to find them a safe indoor home. Rabbits can be adopted from the Jefferson SPCA at Jefferson Feed on Jefferson Highway or from Lola & Friends Rescue. “Rabbits are unable to fend for themselves in the wild,” Johnson said. “They get sick, hawks get them, they get hit by cars, or attacked by dogs. It’s a vicious cycle and a horrible way for them to die.” Johnson said there were five litters from four female bunnies at Kenner Park, and every single one was sick with parasites. The moms were underweight, and he was unsure if any of them were going to live or not. He added that at the rate that rabbits reproduce, the problem is getting exponentially out of hand. Within the past week, two rabbits were seen scared and hiding under cars near Brewski’s Bar and Grill in Lafreniere Park. “Sadly, we just cleared that area, having rescued six in the past several months,” said Johnson. “City Park needs more signs stating that dumping any animal is illegal, but we also want to educate people who may be dumping these rabbits that the rabbits are not going to be OK,” Johnson said. “They will not survive in the wild.” Johnson urges people who are thinking of keeping a rabbit as a pet to learn what the cost of a responsible rabbit owner is. “If you have a male and female that are not spayed and neutered, they will mate and continue to reproduce,” he said. “The cost of a spay or neuter can be high, so ask around before deciding to keep one as a pet. The Jefferson SPCA has a Fix-a-Rabbit Low-Cost Spay/Neuter Program that provides spay/neuter vouchers for only $40 per male bunny and $60 for each female to Jefferson Parish residents or caretakers. Additional details can be found at https://www. jeffersonspca.org/low-cost-rabbit-spayneuter. The Humane Society of Louisiana, which is helping Johnson spread the word about the dumped rabbits, stresses not to give rabbits or bunnies as Christmas or Easter gifts. Many are abandoned once the novelty wears off. “After conferring with Mr. Johnson, we are left with two impressions. First, we are shocked at how many rabbits are abandoned in our parks regularly. Second, we are impressed and very grateful to James and Sherri Johnson, his group, and the Jefferson SPCA for addressing this big, under-the-radar problem,” said Jeff Dorson, HSLA Director. “I’m in the industry and did not realize the extent of the problem until I spoke with Mr. Johnson.” To learn more or donate to help Johnson care for the rescued rabbits, find Lola and Friends Bunny Rescue of South MS Inc. on Facebook.
