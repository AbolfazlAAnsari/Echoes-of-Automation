Intercollegiate athletic association has canceled fall sports amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Fort Valley State University is apart of that conference according to athletic director Anthony Holloman the university and the conference were not comfortable with having sporting events. They also were not comfortable with athletes traveling to games as well. “At Fort Valley State our athletes are apart of the regular campus population. They live in dorms with other student-athletes. They go to class and eat in the same dining rooms and so once you start to look at that. And you realize the cost associated with testing on a frequent basis. We realized we are not going to mintage the risk of playing football or any fall sport,” says Holloman The canceling of the fall 2020 season also affects many athletes inside of this. We spoke with Shemar Bridges who is a wide receiver for Fort Valley State University. He says his teammates will remain optimistic although there will be no football season. “I tell myself and my teammates just to be positive you can’t just sit here and be negative it’s said and done now just keep going forward and just keep working hard,” says Bridges. The foundation of that positive attitude all started from the FVSU football coaching. Head coach Maurice Flowers says he did have a zoom team meeting this afternoon to address the canceling of their season. He wanted to let his team know that everything was going to be okay. “You can control what you can control. Control the controllable and that’s what we have been concentrating on doing. We can control our attitude, we can control our work ethic. Yes it is a let down, it’s a let down to not play fall everybody wants to play it’s what we have been accustomed to since we were small. You play football in the fall in August in September but now it is going to be adjusting,” says Flowers. The Fort Valley State athletic program hopes they can resume this fall sports season in the spring of 2021.'}]"
