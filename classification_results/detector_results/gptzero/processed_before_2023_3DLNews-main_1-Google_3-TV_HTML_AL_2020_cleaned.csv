(WSFA) - You would be hard pressed to find any sharks in Lowndes County, Alabama, which is nearly 200 miles from a major body of water, but that’s exactly what a team of scientists has done. Fossilized teeth have been unearthed in Alabama of an ancient shark species that’s never identified before. Scientists believe the creature lived in the Gulf of Mexico during the Paleogene Period, about 65 million years ago, just after the extinction of dinosaurs. The new species, Mennerotodus mackayi, is being named in honor of John Mackay, the first president and CEO of the McWane Science Center in Birmingham. The team that made the discovery includes paleontologist Jun Ebersole, the McWayne Center’s director of collections, as well as David Cicimurri, the curator of natural history at the South Carolina State Museum, and George Martin, a retired USDA soil scientist from Auburn. The Lowndes County shark wasn’t the only new species discovered by the team. Another was also found in Central Georgia. “Like in modern Sandtiger Sharks, the front teeth in the mouths of the fossil species are very tall and fang-like” said Ebersole. “These teeth often project out of the mouth, giving the shark a snaggle-toothed appearance, and were perfect for feeding on fishes, crabs, squids, and even other sharks.” While the new species are known only from their teeth, the scientists say it’s not possible to know exactly what they looked like. However, because of their similarities, it’s believed they were probably similar in appearance to the Sandtiger. Copyright 2020 WSFA 12 News. All rights reserved.'}]"

She said it’s been tough, but she wouldn’t want her nieces and nephews to be anywhere else. She said her mother is helping her. “We are just going to try to raise them to be the best that they can be,” McCall said. Francesca said it’s been hard on her financially since losing her sister, but she plans to give the children the best holiday she can. “I’m worried about it a little bit,” she said. “I just want it to be an extra special Christmas this year.” McCall is urging others to be careful. She said she doesn’t want another family to suffer the loss of a sibling or parent. “It is real,” she said. “It is serious and take the necessary precautions.” McCall started a Go-Fund-Me to help get the family of 13 through the holiday season.

Please enter a search term. Matthew Wine, Chief Meteorologist Matthew grew up in Louisville, KY where he attended Christian Academy of Louisville from Kindergarten to Senior year. He fondly remembers classmates asking him about how hot it would be and if there would be any severe storms that week. His interest in weather started when his mom turned on The Weather Channel every night during Hurricane Katrina to watch the constant coverage of the storm. As a thrill-seeker, Matthew was amazed that people could actually place themselves in the path of a hurricane and give reports from inside the storm. Matthew obtained his Meteorology and Broadcast degree from Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, KY. While he was there, he took part in numerous organizations including Christian Student Fellowship, three different meteorology clubs, News Channel 12, and became a Founding Father and President of the Epsilon Xi chapter of Delta Tau Delta Fraternity. One of the most amazing experiences he had in college was being WKU’s mascot, Big Red. The belly-rolling, head-eating mascot embodies the Spirit of WKU and took Matthew to many places across the US. Putting a smile on people’s faces (especially children and those with special needs) made every sweaty moment extremely special. Now that Matthew is in Dothan, he is looking for ways to get involved in the community. He misses doing community service projects and hiking like he used to as a Boy Scout. If you are part of a volunteer organization or know of any good hiking trails nearby, please message him about it! He’s also looking to get plugged back into a church community, so don’t be shy about reaching out to him with your favorite churches Connect with Matthew'}]"
