And that’s exactly what happened to 216 medical workers who were fired last Tuesday for refusing to comply with the nonprofit corporation’s mandate to get a COVID-19 vaccination shot. Another 102 hospital staff members -— who also had been placed on unpaid leave last month for missing a Nov. 15 vaccination deadline — were previously granted a deadline extension up until Friday, Nov. 26. Those 102 employees did in fact return to work the following Monday after showing proof of receiving their first dose, according to Southcoast Health spokesperson Katie Cox. Anyone getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine version only requires a single dose. More health workers fired: UMass Memorial Health fires 200 caregivers who refused to get COVID vaccination Cox, in an email, said the 102 employees “will be tested regularly until they are fully vaccinated.” She said another 151 Southcoast Health employees have been granted vaccine exemptions based either on the merits of their religious belief or for medical reasons. But Cox said all of them must be tested regularly. It's not clear whether any of the 216 fired employees will be eligible to reapply if they get vaccinated. Southcoast Health includes Charlton Memorial Hospital in Fall River; St. Luke’s Hospital in New Bedford; Tobey Hospital in Wareham; a psychiatric hospital in Dartmouth; two cancer treatment centers; and seven urgent care centers, including one in Middletown, Rhode Island. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had previously issued a requirement that all employees of hospitals and other health care facilities receiving Medicare or Medicaid financial benefits must get a first dose by Dec. 5 and be fully vaccinated by Jan. 4. But that CMS order is now on hold since two federal district judges, one in Louisiana and the other in Missouri, issued a preliminary injunction enjoining, or prohibiting, that order from being carried out until either a final court decision has been rendered or another order is issued from an appellate court or the Supreme Court.

January 26, 2021 | Vado Hondo, Guatemala; and Mexico City On Jan. 18, near the border between Guatemala and Honduras, police and troops in riot gear effectively disbanded a migrant caravan – thousands of Hondurans attempting to trek north to the U.S. It was the kind of scene some migrants had expected to disappear once Joe Biden was in the White House. Historically, U.S. immigration policy has strongly informed its neighbors’. And over the past four years, the Trump administration emphasized containment, effectively pressuring Mexico and Guatemala to keep migrants and asylum-seekers far from its border. Mexico and Guatemala toughened up border policies under pressure from Donald Trump. But they may have their own reasons to stick with the new status quo. No matter who’s in the White House, migration challenges aren’t going away. But despite some quick actions on immigration during President Biden’s first week in office, it’s unclear how immigration enforcement might shift in the region. Containment is “easy,” says Gretchen Kuhner, director of the Institute for Women in Migration in Mexico City. “It’s not as messy as trying to interview people and help them get protection.” Fernando Castro, a former vice consul at the Guatemalan Consulate in Chiapas, Mexico, welcomes news of a new U.S. aid package to address root causes of migration. But such efforts need to be closely assessed to see what actually works, he stresses, and regional governments need to band together to sort out their shared interests. “Migration is going to continue,” he says. Two Honduran women pleaded with an immigration official last week, after walking into Guatemala with the estimated 8,000-strong migrant caravan that left Honduras earlier this month. “I’m a single mother,” one of the young women told the Guatemalan official, her voice breaking. “You are eating well. We do not even have bananas because the river swept away all our crops, all our means to work.” She had already traveled more than 250 miles from her home in Yoro, devastated by back-to-back hurricanes last fall, and even before that suffering high unemployment and violent crime. The official was sympathetic, but repeated Guatemala’s policy of requiring a negative COVID-19 test in order to enter. He would have to send them back across the border.

Guatemala, one of the biggest sending countries of migrants to the U.S. in recent years, agreed to take in asylum-seekers from other countries during Mr. Trump’s administration, and met the most recent migrant caravan with force, barring the group from advancing toward the U.S. Mexico and the U.S. thanked Guatemala for its efforts. “We know Donald Trump essentially forced this situation,” says the Rev. Mauro Verzeletti, director of the Casa del Migrante shelter in Guatemala City, speaking of Mexico and Guatemala’s increasingly militarized attempts to halt northbound migration. But he isn’t confident there will be an about-face under Mr. Biden. “Making declarations and repressing people is easy,” says Mr. Verzeletti. Addressing the root causes that put people in such desperate conditions to begin with, he says, takes more resources, will, and work. Historically, Mexico hasn’t had a true migration policy of its own, says María Dolores París Pombo, a professor at the College of the Northern Border outside Tijuana. Instead, it tends to react directly to directives and policies in the U.S. She says Mexico has taken some of its most notable moves around migration at key moments in U.S.-Mexico relations. Mexico created its national migration institute in 1993, for example, in the lead-up to NAFTA. And it launched an initiative to cut off key flows of migration from Guatemala in 2001, before U.S. and Mexican presidents met to discuss immigration reform. Mexico militarized its southern border after President Barack Obama declared a humanitarian crisis over unaccompanied minors arriving at the U.S. border in 2014. “Mexico isn’t a country of immigration like the U.S. It’s more a country of transit,” says Dr. París Pombo, but “the policies the U.S. adopts directly affect Mexico.” Gretchen Kuhner, the director of the Institute for Women in Migration in Mexico City, says Mexico has national interests of its own in keeping levels of migration down. On Inauguration Day, Mr. Biden introduced the U.S. Citizenship Act, which could create a path to citizenship for some 11 million immigrants without legal status. He also issued an executive order to bolster the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, calling on Congress to enact legislation to provide permanent legal status or citizenship for so-called Dreamers, the vast majority of whom are Mexican. “Mexico knows very well that if there’s a surge on the border, the political right in the U.S. will make a huge issue of it, and that could impact the legislative proposals for immigration,” says Ms. Kuhner. “That plays into Mexico’s approach.” Guatemala may be thinking along similar lines: Remittances sent home to Guatemala by relatives in the U.S. reached record levels during the pandemic, surpassing $1 billion a month by the end of 2020. That’s a lifeline few Guatemalan officials want to jeopardize. Containment is also “easy,” says Ms. Kuhner. “It’s not as messy as trying to interview people and help them get protection.” Because of U.S. policies like MPP, Mexico has many more migrants waiting long term than before. “These are""}]"

of companies and businesses in the New Bedford and Fall River region struggling to find workers. “The good news is the economy came roaring back after (the worst of) the pandemic, but the bad news is the economy would be roaring back considerably better if companies could secure their workforce,” said the co-CEO of One SouthCoast Chamber, which operates out of Fall River and New Bedford. Kidder, who oversees the regional chamber of commerce’s New Bedford office, said a day of reckoning is fast approaching for those who have not accepted job offers, and instead have continued to collect the federal government’s $300 weekly “stipend” unemployment bonus check. That pandemic relief aid program expires on Labor Day, Sept. 6. More than two dozen states, however, have already cut off the federal added benefit, which was part of the Biden Administration’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan enacted in March. “They’re approaching a cliff,” Kidder said. “You’ve got more than 300,000 people in Massachusetts with benefits about to expire, but they’re not yet employed.” He called the federal unemployment enhancement — which at one time was $600 as part of the March 2020 CARES Act — “a financial disincentive to return to work.” The U.S. Department of Labor reported 943,000 new jobs in July. But it also reported there were 10.1 million job openings in June and 8.7 million unemployed Americans in July. The Massachusetts June unemployment rate for July remained at 4.9%, according to the Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development. Kidder says he’s also concerned about the eventual termination of the federal government’s ban on rental evictions — which was extended until Oct. 3 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in areas with substantial and high levels of coronavirus transmission. Bristol County is one of those areas. “It has the makings of an economic catastrophe,” Kidder said. Another factor that he says has exacerbated the uncertain job market is child care facilities that have had trouble finding adequate staffing. Kidder also says there’s evidence that some unemployed people are reticent to go back to work because of the recent spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, especially among the ranks of the unvaccinated. Will vaccines be required?: Fall River mayor, area businesses wrestle with controlling COVID “It would really help if more people got vaccinated,” Kidder said, pointing out that the vaccination rates in New Bedford and Fall River lag behind the overall state average. Kidder says it’s no secret that some lower-income earners, who previously qualified for unemployment insurance relief after being laid off, have been reluctant to accept job offers. “They know they can get more money by collecting unemployment with the stipend,” he said. Kidder says he expects as many as 100 employers will attend a Sept. 15 job fair that the regional chamber of commerce is holding at White’s of Westport. “We wanted to wait until after Sept. 6,” he said. Fall River\'s Gold Medal Bakery baking and distribution business on Penn Street, at any given time throughout the summer, has been trying to fill nearly 30 positions ranging from truck drivers and bakery production personnel to sales, human resource and maintenance workers. “That’s more than double the number from a year ago,” said Brian LeComte, chief operating officer of the fourth-generation business known for its bread, rolls, English muffins and other baked goods. LeComte said starting wages for factory workers and qualified truckers range from $22 to $29 an hour. A year ago, he said, the wage range was $18 to $27. He said this year’s rehiring effort began in earnest in the spring. LeComte also noted that U.S. companies like that of his own family were having trouble finding enough truck drivers even before the pandemic. Most of Gold Medal’s job openings are at its main corporate, manufacturing and shipping facility, which LeComte says accounts for 400 of the company’s approximately 650 workers. Gold Medal, whose private label line includes loaves of Panera Bread sold in supermarkets and Kayem hot dog rolls, operates in nine states and has shipping sites in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. A number of companies and businesses across the country have resorted to using incentive programs to attract and hire new workers, and Gold Medal is no different in that regard. Hiring incentives: How Fall River area businesses are luring new workers amid post-COVID staffing shortages In some cases employees who refer new workers who stay on the job for a specific length of time are paid a bonus. In other cases it’s the new employee who is compensated, and in yet others it’s both parties who benefit. Gold Medal has been offering a $500 incentive to employees who refer someone who after being hired remains on the job at least six months. LeComte said no one was laid off at Gold Medal after a state of emergency was declared in March of 2020, but he said strict health guidelines dictated that social distancing and other rules be followed. He said Gold Medal received an $8.5 million federal Paycheck Protection Program forgivable loan to offset costs related to payroll, utilities, new operational protocol and the purchase of personal protection equipment. COVID relief: \'The income just went away\': PPP loans a lifesaver for Fall River businesses LeComte, whose father, Roland, is the chief executive of Gold Medal, also said that a decision was made last year to close the company’s retail “thrift store” on nearby Bay Street. “The greatest risk of COVID was in that store,” he said. LeComte said filling job vacancies is not just important in terms of fulfilling orders and increasing sales revenue. He said not having a full staff creates a burden for existing employees who are asked to work overtime. They’ve been scrambling for workers at the Sid Wainer & Son food and specialty product distribution facility in New Bedford. “To go from half to full in a short time is very challenging. It’s a much more competitive landscape now,” said regional vice president Allie Wainer, whose great-grandfather Sid started the company more than 100 years ago. Wainer was referring to the elimination by Gov. Baker last March of indoor-seating capacity restrictions for restaurants in the state. She said the company, which normally would have as many as 250 truck drivers on payroll, has been looking for 20 to 30 additional drivers. Starting pay for a third-shift Class A shuttle driver capable of driving a 53-foot trailer to assigned locations within the company’s multi-state network, according to a listing on the job site Indeed, is $23 an hour. An “urgently hiring” listing for third-shift warehouse workers willing to work overtime is offering $16.50 an hour; a $500 incentive bonus, which kicks in after four months on the job; and a range of benefits including a 401(k) retirement plan, health insurance, parental leave and employee discounts. Wainer says the company wants to hire as many as 40 third-shift workers for a total number equaling around 250. “It’s definitely a job seeker’s market right now,” she said. Connecticut-based The Chefs’ Warehouse Inc. in 2020 bought nearly all Sid Wainer & Sons’ assets. Wainer, like Brian LeComte at Gold Medal, says hiring truck drivers was difficult even before the onslaught of the pandemic in early 2020. “It’s been the same for the 10 years I’ve worked here. There’s a national shortage of drivers,” said Wainer, adding that “it hasn’t been a sought-after career for several years.” Telly Gatos says only one person during the past year has applied for a job at his Cousin Mike’s Pizza parlor on East Main Street in Fall River. “She worked a day or two and quit,” said Gatos. “I think they try to work the system,” he added. “They want to capitalize on it, and I can’t blame them.” Gatos said his father, Arthur, who took over the business from the former owner in 1989, and his mother, Alexandra, still come in to help out.

Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., speaks to reporters Wednesday after House Republicans voted to oust her from her leadership post as chair of the House Republican Conference because of her repeated criticism of former President Donald Trump for his false claims of election fraud and his role in instigating the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack. It has been six months since last November’s presidential election, and a CNN poll shows that 30 percent of Americans still think Donald Trump won. Among Republicans, the number is 70 percent. The GOP just ousted Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney from her House leadership role because she wouldn’t accept the “Big Lie,” as many news outlets are now calling the assertion that Trump won. Meanwhile, Republicans in Arizona, where Trump lost, are engaged in a messy, ponderously partisan recount of the votes from last November to uncover alleged evidence of voting fraud. Not much of that has been found so far, in Arizona or anywhere. Yet a Monmouth polls shows that 65 percent of Republicans believe fraud put Joe Biden in the White House. The squabble over who really won in 2020 has thrown up a toxic cloud of doubt and resentment that is poisoning American politics. Even some non-Republicans wonder if our current president really is legit. I don’t get it. The U.S. has been holding elections for more than two centuries. This shouldn’t be hard to figure out. So I gave it a try. Rather than wade through all the claims and counterclaims, ballots and court documents, I went to the ultimate arbiter of truth for many U.S. households: Alexa. I was inspired in this effort by a visit to North Adams a few days before the election. There, at Mass MoCA, I was captivated by Brazilian artist Clarissa Tossin’s ink-on-paper work, “You Got to Make Your Own Words...” Tossin was asking deeper questions — about the nature of truth and technology, the fate of the planet and our nagging sense of uselessness — but her method was much the same as mine. Here is a transcript of my interview with one of the country’s most respected voices — using her actual answers, edited for concision. (Warning: If you choose to read this aloud, you may want to turn off any voice-enabled Amazon devices, lest she stir at the mention of her name.) To wit: Alexa, who won the 2020 presidential election? According to the Associated Press, Democrat Joe Biden beat Republican incumbent Donald Trump, by 51 percent to 47 percent, to win the presidency. Alexa, Trump says he won. Is that true? Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Alexa, why do so many people think Trump won? Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Alexa, what is the “Big Lie”? The Big Lie is a propaganda technique used for political purposes and defined as a gross distortion or misrepresentation of the facts. The expression was coined by Adolf Hitler. For the latest in politics, ask me to play “Flash Briefing.” Alexa, was there widespread fraud in the 2020 election? Answer: Hmmm, I don’t have the answer to that. Alexa, if a major political party refuses to accept the election results, does American democracy have a future? Sorry, I can’t help you with that. I plodded on, from Trump’s ever-tightening grip on the GOP to the party’s push in 43 states for new curbs on voting — to avoid fraud, of course. But Alexa clearly knew she was on treacherous ground. She grew increasingly vague and unhelpful. So, I went to her chief rival, Siri, the sage of Apple (and the oracle used by Clarissa Tossin for her Mass MoCA inquiry). To my opening question, about who won the presidential election, Siri answered confidently and succinctly: “Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election.” But after that, she too became evasive. I don’t know, maybe I didn’t phrase my questions right. Perhaps I should have begun with some easy warm-ups of a less controversial nature.

After several months of continued public hearings, two site visits by commission members, consultation with town-contracted wetlands scientist Bob Gray and recent revisions on September 13, Gray filed an October 23 letter with the commission indicating his own satisfaction with John and Cynthia Paliotta’s land-management plan to eradicate invasive plants at 119 Converse Road. The vote of the commission to grant the Paliottas an Order of Conditions culminated what amounted to a one-and-done with Gray, seeing that by the time his work was finished the town had hired Guey Lee in the dual role of conservation agent and town planner. Conservation Commission Chairman Shaun Walsh was nonetheless pleased to have gone through the experience of working with Gray and by extension the Paliottas, noting ConCom established a rapport with the applicant. “I think we’re in a really good place right now with the revisions that were made,” said Walsh. Noting that there was no new information to introduce to the process, Walsh recommended the commissioners vote to close the public hearing. He said that, at least in his tenure as chairman, this was the first time that ConCom had hired an outside consultant and called it “an excellent experience.” Given the floor, Gray concurred, calling it “a good experience working with the commission members. I’m happy that you now have a new agent, and I think you’re in good hands.” Gray referenced his report and asked for questions. The work, taking place in a salt marsh, was only allowed to be permitted as a Ecological Restoration Project (ERP) and during the next three years will include the occasional removal of invasive species sprouting up after initial removal. The commissioners were satisfied and voted unanimously in favor of the Order of Conditions. Guey Lee’s impact was felt more directly on the case of Todd Zell’s NOI that sought approval to install a water-quality inlet on a stormceptor discharge pipe to service a proposed commercial development on Village Drive. Representative Ken Motta explained that, as a 40B project (Sippican Village), commercial usage is allowed as a matter of right on the first floor and one apartment on the second floor. Walsh said that, driving by the wooden area between the Brew Fish restaurant and parking lot, one wouldn’t suspect that the lot is buildable but it is in fact. In answer to a question from ConcCom member Jeff Doubrava, Motta said the intention has been to duplicate the plan approved in 2013, but he added that work may wind up commencing within the buffer zone in the small corner of the lot. Concurring with Doubrava’s observation, Walsh said the commission needs more information on proposed elevation upgrades within the buffer zone and said that adding fill there would require a Special Permit. The NOI, the commission contends, does not explicitly address action relevant to ConCom’s purview. Motta reiterated that the application intends to seek approval of what was already approved in 2013, albeit via different applicant. Based on Doubrava’s observation and with assistance from Guey Lee, Walsh understood that the proposed stormceptor would convey stormwater into a stormwater detention basin located within the buffer zone, and that requires permitting. ConCom voted to grant an Order of Conditions matching in detail the OOC granted in 2013. Jay Flanagan filed a NOI for septic upgrade and garage additions at 26 West Avenue. After representative Dave Davignon of Schneider, Davignon & Leone Inc., presented the proposed plan, Walsh told him that, while the site visit did not reveal any unsightly matters pertaining to the septic, the situation is far from desirable with a drainage pipe exiting near the base of the seawall. Minus a state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) file number, the case would necessarily be continued, but Walsh nonetheless asked Davignon to investigate the track and purpose of the drainage pipe. “When we were out there, there was no liquid coming out of the pipe, nor did there appear to be any kind of scouring or erosion on the beach either, which is obviously a good sign, but … I would ask if you would take a look at that (pipe),” said Walsh. “I certainly hope it has nothing to so with the cesspool, and I don’t think it does. … Obviously, whenever we see a pipe exiting out through a seawall or a bank to a coastal-beach area, that gives us pause.” Davignon said he check the catch basin to see if it contains any kind of outflow pipe. Overall, Walsh called the project “a huge improvement,” citing the danger of a “very old” cesspool so close to a beach. The garage expansion is 4 feet to the west, and the deck would extend an additional 6 feet beyond the expansion of the garage. A direct abutter told the meeting that the applicant had not shared any information to date and expressed concern that the road and overhead wires would potentially sustain damage during construction. Walsh explained that ConCom’s jurisdiction is limited to wetlands and any area within 100 feet of wetlands to examine potential impacts. He advised the abutter that the property association is the proper forum to discuss the presented concerns. Another abutter, Elizabeth Luther, asked if the leaching field would change the contours of the land and result in runoff heading toward her property. Walsh complimented the question but said the plan indicates no regrading of the area in question. Davignon concurred on both fronts and further explained the details of the plan. Flanagan bought property in May 2021, prior owner had a similar plan but didn’t follow through before the sale. The hearing was continued to ConCom’s November 17 meeting. J. Thomas Bowler Jr. and Ellen Bowler’s NOI for vegetation management at 7 Moorings Road was represented by Wilkinson Ecological and, after separate site visits by several commissioners, was considered by Walsh to be “a plan that will dramatically improve the area.” A prior NOI for the same site resulted in demolition of an old house and construction of a new house. Asking for revisions to the present NOI, ConCom voted to continue the public hearing to November 17. John and Pamela Lees, who filed a NOI for reconstruction of a single-family house, an inground swimming pool, along with repair of a seawall with associated work at 49 Water Street, requested a continuance. The commissioners voted to continue to their November 17 meeting. In outlining special conditions for stormwater management, Guey Lee recommended the commission include maintenance stipulations with the commission’s vote to award Burr Brothers Boatyard, 309 Front Street, a full Certificate of Compliance. Those measures will address the maintenance of the pocket wetlands at the site. ConCom also voted a full Certificate of Compliance to Robert and Joan Wilson, 43 Holly Road, for their new septic system originally permitted several years ago. The Marion Conservation Commission is next scheduled to meet on Wednesday, November 17, at 7:00 pm. Marion Conservation Commission By Mick Colageo Categories: News Name * Email * Website Δ'}]"

Events have cascaded over the past month. Russia’s treatment of imprisoned dissident Alexei Navalny, who has been sent to a prison hospital amid reports of failing health, underlines the differences between Russia and the West over matters of human rights. Meanwhile, a Russian military buildup near Ukraine has illustrated that the conflict might explode at any time. With its relations with Washington at a nadir, Russia is eyeing a more pragmatic, if adversarial, relationship with the U.S. in the hopes of getting the respect it desires. Foreign policy experts agree that there is a long list of practical issues that could benefit from high-level discussion. With the U.S. preparing to exit Afghanistan, some coordination with regional countries, including Russia, might make the transition easier for everyone. One of President Joe Biden’s first acts in office was to extend the New START arms control agreement, but the former paradigm of strategic stability remains in tatters, experts say. “If you are looking for opportunities to make the world a safer place through reason and compromise, there are quite a few,” says Andrey Kortunov, director of the Russian International Affairs Council. “There are also some areas where the best we could do is agree to disagree, such as Ukraine and human rights issues.” Russia’s relations with the West, and the United States in particular, appear to be plumbing depths of acrimony and mutual misunderstanding unseen even during the original Cold War. After years of deteriorating relations, sanctions, tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions, and an escalating “information war,” some in Moscow are asking if there even is any point in seeking renewed dialogue with the U.S., if only out of concern that more talking might just make things worse. Events have cascaded over the past month. Russia’s treatment of imprisoned dissident Alexei Navalny, who has been sent to a prison hospital amid reports of failing health, underlines the sharp perceived differences between Russia and the West over matters of human rights. Meanwhile, a Russian military buildup near Ukraine has illustrated that the conflict in the Donbass region might explode at any time, possibly even dragging Russia and NATO into direct confrontation. With its relations with Washington at a nadir, Russia is eyeing a more pragmatic, if adversarial, relationship with the U.S. in the hopes of getting the respect it desires. President Joe Biden surprised the Kremlin by proposing a “personal summit” to discuss the growing list of U.S.-Russia disagreements in a phone conversation with Vladimir Putin last week. He later spoke of the need for “disengagement” in the escalating tensions around Ukraine, and postponed a planned visit of two U.S. warships to Russia-adjacent waters in the Black Sea. But days later he also imposed a package of tough sanctions against Russia, for its alleged SolarWinds hacking and interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential elections, infuriating Moscow and drawing threats of retaliation. Last month, after Mr. Biden agreed with a journalist’s intimation that Mr. Putin is a “killer,” the Kremlin ordered Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. to return home for intensive consultations, an almost unprecedented peacetime move. Over the weekend, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested that the acting U.S. ambassador to Moscow, John Sullivan, should likewise go back to Washington for a spell. On Tuesday, Mr. Sullivan announced he would do just that this week. And there is a growing sense in Moscow that the downward spiral of East-West ties has reached a point of no return, and that Russia should consider abandoning hopes of reconciliation with the West and seek permanent alternatives: perhaps in an intensified compact with China, and targeted relationships with countries of Europe and other regions that are willing to do business with Moscow. “Things are at rock bottom. This may not be structurally a cold war in the way the old one was, but mentally, in terms of atmosphere, it’s even worse,” says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global Affairs, a Moscow-based foreign policy journal. “The fact that Biden offered a summit meeting would have sounded a hopeful note anytime in the past. Now, nobody can be sure of that. A hypothetical Putin-Biden meeting might not prove to be a path to better relations, but just the opposite. It could just become a shouting match that would bring a hardening of differences, and make relations look like even more of a dead end.” Foreign policy experts agree that there is a long list of practical issues that could benefit from purposeful high-level discussion. With the U.S. preparing to finally exit Afghanistan, some coordination with regional countries, including Russia and its Central Asian allies, might make the transition easier for everyone. One of Mr. Biden’s first acts in office was to extend the New START arms control agreement, which the Trump administration had been threatening to abandon, but the former paradigm of strategic stability remains in tatters and requires urgent attention, experts say. “If you are looking for opportunities to make the world a safer place through reason and compromise, there are quite a few,” says Andrey Kortunov, director of the Russian International Affairs Council, which is affiliated with the Foreign Ministry. “There are also some areas where the best we could do is agree to disagree, such as Ukraine and human rights issues.” The plight of Mr. Navalny, which has evoked so much outrage in the West, seems unlikely to provide leverage in dealing with the Kremlin because – as Western moral authority fades – Russian public opinion appears indifferent, or even in agreement with its government’s actions. Recent surveys by the Levada Center in Moscow, Russia’s only independent pollster, found that fewer than a fifth of Russians approve of Mr. Navalny’s activities, while well over half disapprove. An April poll found that while 29% of Russians consider Mr. Navalny’s imprisonment unfair, 48% think it is fair. Tensions around the Russian-backed rebel republics in eastern Ukraine have been much severer than usual, with a spike in violent incidents on the front line, a demonstrative Russian military buildup near the borders, and strong U.S. and NATO affirmations of support for Kyiv. The Russian narrative claims that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy triggered the crisis a month ago by signing a decree that makes retaking the Russian-annexed territory of Crimea official Ukrainian state policy. Mr. Zelenskiy has also appealed to the U.S. and Europe to expedite Ukraine’s membership in NATO, which Russia has long described as a “red line” that would lead to war.

Learn more at www.fopwalk.org/event/2617 Photo used courtesy of St. Mary’s SvDP Society Saturday Sept. 25, 2021, 9:00 a.m. - Noon Mark your calendars to help your neighbors in need on Saturday, September 25, 2021, and take part in the St. Mary’s Church St. Vincent de Paul Society’s Friends of the Poor Walk, from 9 a.m. to 12 noon. While prior years had walkers doing a mapped-out route through town streets, says Nancy Schoen, last year, due to Covid, the walk was virtual and a bit more casual, with some SvDP members walking around the Town Common. This year, the group has decided to keep the walk around the Franklin Common for a more visibility within the Franklin community. Walkers can walk one mile or three miles, with one time around the common a third of a mile. “This is our only formal fundraiser,” says Schoen. “People are encouraged to donate, and often they will (donate) in memory or in honor of someone. One hundred percent of the money raised goes back into helping anyone in the Franklin community who is in need. The St. Vincent de Paul Society is thankful to all who have so generously donated in the past.” Each year, the St. Vincent de Paul Society (SVdP) of St. Mary’s Church walks to bring awareness to the Franklin Community of the struggles some residents experience that impact their daily lives. For thirty years, SVdP has been helping people in need in regardless of race, religious beliefs or ethnic background. The SVdP members work closely with many charitable and government organizations in Franklin. The SVdP members are all volunteers. Members assist people in a number of ways to help them retain their dignity and to help them to become self-sustaining. Some ways in which the SVdP society assists those in need include: • Guide them to other resources, both state and charitable • Provide clothing and furniture through our SVDP Thrift Stores • Supply non-perishable food and paper products from our pantry to supplement other food resources • Assist financially during an unexpected crisis helping to pay rent, medical, car repairs etc. Last year St. Mary’s SVdP Society helped Franklin Families 345 times for $59,319. Schoen says that rent and food are “probably our two biggest areas of need, and then after that it’s clothing, furniture, medical and car repairs.” The people helped, she says, are really “across the board. We work with some younger single people, many elderly on fixed incomes, and we work with a lot of families who have limited resources. During the pandemic, we saw all kinds of situations. I think the eviction legislation was helpful to many, and I’m concerned at what we’re going to see when that’s completely lifted.” SVdP volunteers use teamwork to answer local need. “Two to three people four days a week will answer the calls,” says Schoen. “During the pandemic, one person would go get the phone and bring it to their house, and we’d call neighbors back together on speaker phone. The bag of food we’d leave on the curb or on the steps. We’re still pretty much doing that, although we will meet with neighbors in need at the church, socially-distanced.” Schoen credits SVdP President Jim Baillio with implementing some practices during Covid “that allowed us to consistently help neighbors in need in our community.” During the pandemic, the members of the SVdP Society in Franklin met through Zoom. The group has begun meeting in person, but retains a Zoom option, on the second and fourth Tuesdays of the month, at 7 p.m., in Sacred Heart Hall in the basement of St. Mary’s Church. Schoen says the SVdP Society in Franklin works closely with other local helping organizations. “We guide them to other resources in the community, including the Franklin Food Pantry and the Senior Center. We turn to each other – when we don’t have something and somebody else has, we can direct them toward that.” The society has a resource list it shares with the Franklin Food Pantry, and Schoen says the Franklin Food Pantry’s new mobile food unit was something that out of their communication. If you would like to support SVdP’s mission of helping residents of Franklin in need, you may make a financial donation in one of two ways. 1.

Courtesy Colleen Green Buy images from this gallery LOWELL — Less than a year after Colleen Green sold almost all of her possessions to fund a move across the country in a Dodge Shadow with her boyfriend to Oakland, Calif., the 24-year-old Dunstable native and UMass Lowell graduate was diagnosed with an incurable auto-immune disease that she hadn’t even heard of before, and which left her unable to work or pay rent.It ended up being the best thing that ever happened to her.Now 36, making music for a branch of a record label she idolized when she was younger, and having the first single off her latest album recommended by the New York Times for the nation’s summer playlists, Green is back from a decade in LA and told her story over tequila at the Worthen House Cafe in Lowell, where she used to play shows upstairs with her college bands.Four other friends, including those who started The Have Mercys with Green in Boston, had also moved with her to Oakland in 2009, but Green had to leave the boyfriend and bandmates behind just months later as her disease — myasthenia gravis — initially left her with no real options other than moving in with her brother in Los Angeles, a city where she knew no one else.“I had a crisis when I realized I had an incurable disease and was never going to be normal again and was going to have to take medication every day for the rest of my life. I was devastated. I was also really (expletive) depressed and I was alone and it was really, really hard. It was bad,” Green said. “I had a revelation like what if I just die? I don’t know what this disease is going to do to me. I’m basically blindly following what my doctor is telling me and I don’t know what’s going to happen so I need to start living for myself and doing exactly what I want to do and quit worrying about this and that because I could die tomorrow.”Colleen Green, a Dunstable-native and UMass Lowell graduate who used a $35 drum machine and nothing but her own talent to get a record deal after moving to LA under duress, performs at the Moroccan Lounge in Los Angeles on July 21, 2019.

""The board received a complaint regarding the police chief, Michael Pighetti,"" Select Board Chairman William Kingkade Jr. said during Monday night\'s board meeting. ""It was decided by the board to bring in a third party to investigate the incident."" It\'s unclear what the incident was or how long the investigation will take, but Kingkade said Pighetti will be on paid leave until the investigation report comes back. Lt. James Falvey will serve as acting police chief in the meantime. ""I want to assure the public that everything is fine,"" Select Board member Michael Walsh said Tuesday morning, adding that he couldn\'t yet provide details. ""Everything is fine."" A press release from Town Administrator Richard Villani said no further comment would be made, to ""preserve the integrity of the on-going investigation,"" but clarified that the investigation revolved around police powers. ""....pending the completion of an internal investigation into allegations he exercised unauthorized and unnecessary police powers while contractually serving in his capacity as the administrative Police Chief for the Town of Milford,"" Villani\'s press release reads. Pighetti\'s appointment as interim police chief in June 2019, and the three-year contract selectmen offered him eight months later, was a source of controversy in Milford. More: Milford offers interim police chief three-year contract Pighetti was appointed to the interim job over then-Deputy Police Chief Falvey, despite not having full police powers. When a police officer has been out of the force for five or more years, that person is required to complete training through the state\'s police academy. More: Milford appoints Pighetti interim police chief The state\'s Municipal Police Training Committee executive director at the time said the law makes clear that anyone who hasn\'t completed the required training — or in Pighetti\'s case, re-training — wouldn\'t be able to make arrests or conduct search and seizures. It\'s less clear if such a person could use other police powers, or things police can do that ordinary citizens cannot, such as using a cruiser siren and stopping a resident\'s car, the executive director had said. Villani did not immediately respond to a Daily News query into whether Pighetti has since completed the training. More: Interim Milford police chief powers still unclear Town Meeting members protested Pighetti\'s interim appointment in 2019 by removing the police chief\'s salary from the town\'s budget, a move the body ultimately walked back. A handful of residents also sued the town. More: Milford Town Meeting removes police chief\'s salary More: Milford residents sue selectmen and new interim police chief Pighetti was offered the three-year job in March 2020, despite not applying for it, after the then-Board of Selectmen\'s first pick, Baltimore Police Commander James Rhoden, declined the offer. Pighetti was not one of the candidates put forth by the committee formed, and funded with a little over $58,000, to find police chief candidates. More: Selectmen promise to choose next police chief from committee-approved candidates Pighetti took over for former Police Chief Thomas O\'Loughlin, whose contract was not renewed under circumstances that are still unclear, despite his desire to continue serving as Milford\'s police chief. O\'Loughlin followed the nonrenewal with lawsuits against the town, but was since awarded Milfordian of the Year, and now serves as one of Milford\'s three Select Board members. More: Milford chief: Town has targeted my family More: O\'Loughlin named Milfordian of the Year More: Milford\'s former police chief to run for office Kingkade\'s announcement Monday was made after an executive session to discuss two complaints concerning town employees. In reading the reason for going into executive session, Kingkade said the complaints were about separate employees. ""We will keep the public abreast (as) best we can when information is brought to this board,"" Kingkade said. Pighetti did not return a call from the Daily News by Tuesday\'s print deadline.

native Sharayu Mahale stars in new HBO film, “Unmothered.” (Photo/courtesy Chris Jon at Chris Jon Photography) By Cynthia Whitty Twenty-seven-year-old Sharayu Mahale is an LA-based actress who grew up in Ashland. On Sept. 27, “Unmothered,” a short film where she is the lead, was released on HBO Max. The film competed at several film festivals, and most recently, placed first at the Asian Pacific American (APA) Visionaries short film competition sponsored by HBO. “This project is very dear to my heart as we filmed it in India right before the pandemic started,” Mahale said. “Coming from a small town like Ashland, I think my story may resonate with aspiring filmmakers and encourage them to think big and follow their dreams.” Mahale’s parents emigrated from India to the U.S. in 1993, and a year later she was born in Massachusetts. The family moved to Ashland in 2000, where she attended first grade. She graduated from Ashland High School in 2012. Mahale says she stays connected to her Ashland community through regular visits to her parents and zoom calls with high school friends. In this interview, Mahale talks about her Ashland roots, how she became an actor, and what the film, “Unmothered,” means to her. Whitty: What motivated you to become an actor? Growing up I was always very curious about the arts and secretly wanted to pursue this field, but it felt impossible because I’d seen so few South Asians make it in mainstream entertainment. For the longest time the only representation I had seen in television was the animated character “Apu” in the Simpsons and Kunal Nayar in “Big Bang Theory.” I remember when I was young my mum and I would go to the movies and watch the credits at the end so we could count how many Indian names we found in the credits; it was never more than a handful. It wasn’t until I grew older and started questioning and thinking critically about why it was so rare to see people that looked like me represented on television. There was no one defining moment for me but rather a series of incidents that ultimately lead me to believe that I could be the change that I wanted to see. Whitty: How did living in Ashland influence you? In middle and high school I was a part of the band program and played flute and saxophone for several years. While I unfortunately was not particularly gifted in music, I am grateful that through the band program I met other students like Tim Merle and Parker Sheil who went on to pursue careers in music. That was the first time I met someone who was interested in pursuing the arts full time. I didn’t yet have the courage to commit to the arts full time at that point, but I do think it made an impression on me of what the possibilities could be. Whitty: How were you chosen for this film? It happened rather serendipitously! I was visiting family in India December of 2019 through January of 2020. I happened to get in touch with the director, Urvashi Pathania, and the casting team at the right moment through a friend’s referral and submitted my audition just days before the shoot was about to begin. I remember scrambling to film an audition at my aunt’s house in India and having my young cousins read the script with me out loud to help me scrape together an audition tape just in time. Within four days of submitting my audition, I was on set filming for “Unmothered” in Rajasthan, India. It was truly one of the fastest turnaround times I’ve ever had! Whitty: What does the story mean to you? “Unmothered” is about a rebellious Indian American girl who discovers a serious secret about her quirky family when she returns to India to immerse her mother’s ashes. Each character in the film processes grief differently, and what I love is that this subject matter could easily have ventured into melodrama, but instead it has pockets of bizarre humor sprinkled in that feel genuine and add texture. Just like in real life, grief is seldom one-note; it ebbs and flows and surprises us with unexpected humor at times. What was particularly special about this story to me is that so often we see stories from India portraying India as a third world nation overwhelmed with poverty. What I liked about the director was that she was determined to make a movie set in India that did not center around “poverty porn” and class struggles. This feels like a step in the right direction of adding nuance to the portrayal of India in western cinema. Whitty: Tell me about the character you play. The character I play, Priyanka, is a rebellious spirit who goes against the norm. She challenges traditional gender norms in India, she questions her family’s judgment, and she ultimately ends up standing up for herself when no one else will. Rather than sitting back and allowing things to happen to her, she takes ownership of her destiny and how she wants to grieve the loss of her mother. I loved exploring this character because she is far more outspoken and daring than I am in real life. She inspired me to make bolder choices in my personal life and question certain customs and norms that I see around me. Whitty: What’s next for you? I have been on two seasons of “Attaway General” on Brat TV, a medical drama for high schoolers available on Hulu and YouTube. I just finished workshopping a new play called “Women of Zalongo” about generational trauma through a few generations of Greek women. And if you’re looking for a good laugh, you can find my series “Bollywood on a Budget” on TikTok where I recreate funny and iconic sequences from funny Bollywood classics.
