BRENDAN BYRNE, BYLINE: Russian cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin in were inside the station's airlock, about to begin a spacewalk, but then warnings that the Soyuz capsule was jetting liquid into space. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: The cause of that leak of coolant, not known at this point, the effect, not yet known at this point. BYRNE: Ground teams canceled the spacewalk.

TERRY VIRTS: When you see it leaking fluid like that, you know something very, very bad is happening.

BYRNE: There are four other astronauts on the ISS that arrived in SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which was unaffected by the coolant leak and can still serve as a lifeboat for that crew. But as NASA and Russia's space agency work to resolve the issue, retired astronaut Terry Virts is urging caution. When investigating a leak on another Soyuz spacecraft in 2018, Russia blamed NASA astronauts and even alleged sabotage by a U.S. crew member. The origin of that leak was never revealed. And with the Russia war in Ukraine, diplomatic tensions remain high. VIRTS: So I really hope they do the right thing.
