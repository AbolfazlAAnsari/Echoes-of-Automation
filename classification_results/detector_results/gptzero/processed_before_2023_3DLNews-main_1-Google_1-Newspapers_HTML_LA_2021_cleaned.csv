The celebrity, the status, the visibility — it can mess with a person’s head. It can turn a human into a false idol, into a social media hotshot who shuns and disdains past relationships — and friendships. That never happened to Sekou Smith, an NBA.com senior analyst, who died Tuesday because of complications from COVID-19. That’s why it hurt so bad Tuesday when a colleague hit me with a three-word text: “Sekou died today.” I’m still stunned. So too are scores of friends and colleagues who responded this week upon hearing the news. Some TV analysts and commentators were broken with open emotion, and some fought back tears in discussing Sekou. Yes, death is always difficult — and with COVID, we have all experienced so much of it that sometimes you feel numb to it. But when a good person, a resource to many, a well-mannered gentleman leaves this earth way too soon at age 48 … it’s just hard to stop crying. You see, Sekou Smith walked among giants, but he kept his feet firmly on solid ground His loss will particularly be felt in the deep South, where he spent much of his career. Smith was still a student at Jackson State in 1994 when he began as a sports reporter at The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Mississippi. He later worked four years at both The Indianapolis Star and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution before going to Turner Sports in 2009. When I contacted Sekou in early 2019 and asked him to participate in a sports workshop for the National Association of Black Journalists, his email response was: “Count me in, sir.” Sekou, a Grand Rapids, Michigan, native, was “raised good,” as my grandma would say. For many of us, Sekou was as down to earth as when we first met him. For me that was 1994. Sekou was a student reporter on my staff for the ASNE Reporter, a newspaper produced for the American Society of News Editors’ conference in Dallas. He was one of those hard-working, mannerly taskmasters who stood out. Some of the other cream-of-the-crop student reporters included columnist and podcaster Jesus Ortiz, public relations executive Corey Dade and Indy Star executive editor Katrice Hardy. Our editing staff included Mark Russell, now executive editor of The Commercial Appeal in Memphis, and Dana Canedy, senior vice president and publisher of Simon & Schuster. Russell and Canedy were rising stars at The Plain Dealer in Cleveland, Ohio, where I was an assistant city editor. Ortiz, a Houston-based writer and blogger, who was the first Latino to serve as president of the Baseball Writers\' Association of America, described his encounter with Sekou during the ASNE conference week. “We roomed together, and he made me feel as though we had known each other forever,” Ortiz said. “We were both college kids trying to make an impression, and I’ll never forget how positive and encouraging he was. “He was a genuinely caring person. His superb talent was evident, and you could tell that he had the type of personality that would garner the respect of sources and colleagues. He had a true gift and a beautiful way about him.” That’s the Sekou we all knew. The Plain Dealer successfully recruited Sekou to be a 1996 summer intern, and his network of would-be stars continued to grow. One of the other interns was Jemele Hill, the now former ESPN personality who is a senior writer for The Atlantic and a mega-media star. Hill tweeted Tuesday about the loss of her longtime friend. “I’ve known Sekou Smith since I was 20 years old,” Hill tweeted. “Never forget the day we met. We were both interns at The Plain Dealer in Cleveland and we met filling out our paperwork. We clicked right away, and a great friendship was born. I’m glad he’s at peace, but this absolutely hurts.” So thankful that the homie @exhoopsPRguy sent me these photos from 2018 of the three of us. #SekouSmith pic.twitter.com/a8oUMwsrVx Sekou was later selected to participate in the 1995 Sports Journalism Institute, of which I’m a board member and instructor. The institute has been training minority and women college sports journalists since 1993. Leon Carter, a former ESPN vice president and one of the SJI co-founders, recalled the impression that Sekou left that summer at Clark Atlanta University. It happened when Sekou had to step out of the classroom to make a phone call. The person to whom Sekou was talking could hear Carter, then an assistant sport editor at the New York Daily News, in the “Sgt.” Carter persona he uses during “boot camp.” “Even as a young journalist, Sekou showed that he had way with words,” Carter said. “That was evident in a call he made to his mom from a pay phone … near the classroom. I could hear his conversation, but he could not see me as I walked by.” The call went something like this: Mom: “Who is that man yelling in the background.” Sekou: “That’s Mr. Carter. I told you he was psycho.” When Sekou returned to the class, Carter posed the question: “Who thinks I’m psycho?” Sekou was silent. Before the boot camp ended, Sekou explained the phone call to “Mr. Carter.” “In later years, when the two of us saw each other at sporting events or NABJ conventions, we always shared a laugh over the ‘psycho’ line,” Carter said. Boston Globe senior assistant managing editor Gregory Lee, an SJI board member who worked with Sekou at NBA.com, a Turner Sports company, had a lot to say about his friend. Lee was in the 1994 SJI class a year after Sekou and they began their careers in the South, seeing each other on assignments and at conventions. The two worked together when Lee joined Turner Sports in 2015 and became one of Sekou\'s editors. ""But before I joined Turner, I called him to get the lay of the land,"" Lee said. ""He was just so open about what to expect and just poured himself into me to make sure I would be cool there. ""He was such a giving person. He loved his family so much. ... He would share funny stories about his kids. ... I will just miss his warmth and spirit. If you were around him, you were a better person for it."" One of my favorite Sekou stories — which I sometimes relate to my journalism students — took place outside of a reception at an NBA All-Star Game in Atlanta. We all spotted this attractive woman, and Sekou, a Jackson State alum, said: “I think she goes to Jackson State.” “Sure,” we said collectively. But as the woman’s group began to pass our group, she recognized Sekou. “I know you,” Sekou said. “You’re Sekou Smith,” the woman said excitedly, and introduced herself. “How do you know me?” Sekou asked. “Sekou, everybody knows you,” she said. “You write for the newspaper.” Sekou served on that sports panel discussion at the NABJ Region 3 Convention in Birmingham in 2019, which I organized but missed the convention because of knee surgery. But we had a good phone discussion catching up leading up to that convention. In my emails, Sekou’s last words to me, referring to my knee surgery, were: “Get well soon.” I so wish I had a chance to say that to him, with some prayers sprinkled on top. Marc Spears, an NBA writer for ESPN’s The Undefeated, did have what turned out to be a farewell conversation, he tweeted this week. “Thank you for your brotherly friendship, humor, honesty and compassion. Glad we had a chance to tell each other we loved each other three weeks ago. You were a gift to this Earth as a friend, father and a man Sekou Smith. Rest in Peace to my brother. Prayers to your wife & family.” My religious upbringing tells me that Sekou is in a better place. But I wish he were here. We wish he were here. David R. Squires is a journalism lecturer at N.C.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:05 pm Staff Writer The coinstar machine inside of Hubben's Supermarket allows Bitcoin purchase. Cryptocurrency has been a topic ablaze in national news. One of the richest men in the world, Elon Musk tweets about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies often. As of March 2021, Forbes reported Tesla, a company of Musk’s, owned over 40,000 Bitcoin which at that time had a value of nearly 2.5 billion dollars. CSNBC reported in June that while Musk briefly accepted Bitcoin as payment through Tesla in 2021, he stopped in mid-May reportedly due to the effects of mining on climate change. Mining requires a lot of energy to create and store the Blockchains which hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Despite all the attention, the digital assets like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and others are cryptic. There are two ways in which to accumulate these currencies. Mining creates new blocks for the existing chain with computer equipment solving code, while purchasing is acquiring the codes for preexisting blocks. Each block has an identifier and is unique. Buying and trading is done on exchanges but to have the key, transfer off of the exchange is required, say to a digital wallet. Wallet software stores a private key, but the currency asset is still stored on the chain. The block chain is security in that it serves as a public ledger. Investors can see trades in real time, what is being traded and how much exists. This is visible to everyone, but the identity of the owner is anonymous. One of the major issues concerning investments in cryptocurrency is the lack of set value. Luis Interiano, a reference librarian at West Baton Rouge Library has been reading up on cryptocurrency to stay informed for patrons and says, “It’s an agreement, a string of code or electronic bits that exist in a computer.” For some types, the value is agreed upon by investors and not based on any tangible resource unlike a company value in stocks or commodity value. Still, it has been a popular route for investors. One risk for investors is outlined by Interiano’s observation, “Once people start doubting it, it loses its value.” A major concern from the public is the volatility of the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Plus, trading cryptocurrency differs from markers such as the NYSE in that trading never closes. Another censure both from governments and people is the use of these platforms to launder money without detection, as the currencies are not regulated by any government entity. To understand what other concerns or benefits are or could be, the basis for which Bitcoin was created must be understood. The film, Cryptopia was reviewed by Liquid Crypto Blog as one of the most accurate films on the subject. In the documentary, Torsten Hoffmann, one of the two directors, interviews the major players in today’s cryptocurrency technology. While there is truth to the criticism of black market use, it is only taking advantage of the crypto ideals which include decentralizing governance, instantaneous worldwide transfers at any time, and privacy. The room for misuse in such a currency is one side of the coin while the flip side gives an advantage in financial security for people under the control of unjust governments or who live in a country with unstable currency. Bitcoin is programmed to be a fixed supply. At the time Cryptopia was made (2020) there were about 18 million Bitcoin mined. The cap is 21 million Bitcoin. The fixed number of possible units should in theory stabilize the digital asset. However, its ability to be used is still a crucial part of its value. As stated in the film, one of the founding documents of this craze is the 2008 white paper written by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. However, it seems Satoshi Nakamoto is a pen name. No one knows the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. An anonymous founder, a perfect figure head to a decentralized currency. The original nine-page white paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” outlines the aims for Bitcoin. On page two of the document, it states, “We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures.” The model for exchange is based on full disclosure via public ledger, “cryptographic proof” rather than the current system of exchange through banks or other financial institutions which act as a trusted party. The aim of Bitcoin, at least through the lens of Satoshi Nakamoto, was to create a currency which is not regulated by government or banks. Since Bitcoin took off, many other cryptocurrencies were created and use similar technology. In the film, the directors give examples of some big business embracing block chain technology for tracking supply chains, testing use for communication between self-driving cars and manned drivers (BMW), and tokenizing items or services to eliminate middlemen. The film points out the irony of big business harnessing this new technology, as the technology itself was created in part to decentralize control and create peer-to-peer trading. No business in West Baton Rouge currently accepts Bitcoin directly. However, the Coinstar machine inside of Hubben’s Supermarket on North Alexander Ave. allows customers to buy Bitcoin. For this type of transaction, you must use cash (not coins), have a digital wallet set up with coinme.com which requires signing in with a government ID. When the screen prompts the user to insert cash, the current Bitcoin exchange rate will be visible on the screen. The voucher code and phone number entered are used to transfer the Bitcoin into the digital wallet. While the practical application of Bitcoin as a replacement currency isn’t a current reality in town, some other proposed real world uses of block chain technology make use of the unchangeable and traceable nature of transactions. N.F.T.s or “non-fungible tokens” can use the technology as it serves as “a unique digital identifier that cannot be copied, substituted or subdivided” per Merriam Webster. CSNBC reported in March 2021 that Mark Cuban was considering changing ticketing for the Dallas Mavericks to N.F.T.s in the future. One draw to this technology is that the secondary market (ticket resales) of an N.F.T. could still be within the original seller’s profit margin and programmed in from the start. The unique identifier also makes forged tickets less likely. The blockchain technology behind Bitcoin has many possibilities, but the currency isn’t widely accepted in retail and converting it to U.S. dollars is a taxable event. The taxing of Bitcoin as property (asset) has made the use as a currency infeasible. In the film, crypto industry professionals are largely accepting the national limitations legislation can create upon the currency, but the system, which is open-source code stored all over the world holds a value in that it is a permanent record of transactions and ownership that cannot be altered or destroyed. The potential uses of this technology are still unfolding. Staff Writer As I can judge, cryptocurrency is quite convenient for you to get more money. Invest as far as I know.

His interest in politics grew as he became involved in the FFA and held state office while attending DeRidder High School. “I thought about becoming a lawyer and running for governor someday during that time,” Nash said, “but I tell people Baton Rouge’s loss was heaven’s gain.” In The Powerful Passman, Nash brings his passion for politics and the scholarship of a lifelong theologian together to give the definitive study of the life and career of a man who was arguably north Louisiana’s most powerful politician. “He grew up as one of the poorest people in the state, often living on cornbread and clabberd milk before rising to one of the highest positions in the country,” Nash said. The book begins there, with Passman’s birth on June 27, 1900 in the San Pedro community of Washington Parish and follows his life as the son of a sharecropper. Nash talks about Passman’s father “renting him out” to a neighboring farmer to work for $5 a month and reveals how the future Congressman’s parents would ask him to leave home to find work at the age of 13 so they could afford to raise his siblings. He talks about how Passman enrolled in night school to complete his high school education, later studying at Soule Business College in Bogalusa. Passman would eventually relocate to Monroe where he would form Passman Equipment Company in 1929. The company was involved in the manufacture of commercial refrigerators and distributed hotel and restaurant supplies and electrical appliances, but, perhaps more importantly, it was where Passman began to make the connections he would use to rise to office. When World War II broke out, Passman joined the U.S. Navy, rising to the rank of lieutenant commander, before returning to Monroe at the end of the war to resume his business dealings briefly before running for congress as a conservative Democrat. He would serve 30 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, from 1947 to 1977. “He grew up in poverty,” Nash said, “and he never wanted to return to poverty.” This fear may have been the drive behind Passman’s reputation for gutting foreign aid bills, trying to keep tax dollars at home. He would also make supporting American veterans a priority during his term in Congress. The details of those 30 years are painstakingly documented in Nash’s book. He spent more than four years researching it by going through 270 filing cabinets filled with documents donated to the University of Louisiana - Monroe by the late Congressman. “The first term, he didn’t do a lot of record keeping,” Nash said, “but by the second term, he’d gotten the hang of it. Each of those 270 filing cabinets had four draws with 200 to 300 papers in them.” Nash also interviewed friends and colleagues of Passman’s such as former Gov. Edwin Edwards and former Secretary of State Jim Brown. Nash has also written High Hat Sam, a biography of former Louisiana Governor Sam Jones, and The Battle of the Longs about the lives of politicians Speedy and Gillis Long. It was during research for High Hat Sam, that former superintendent of Morehouse Parish schools Richard Hartley, and former assistant to Lieutenant Gov. Jay Dardenne suggested Nash do a book on the life of Passman. “He said if someone didn’t do a book on Otto Passman, we would lose that part of our history,” Nash said. Fortunately, Nash listened and the result is The Powerful Passman, 220 pages of history and humor with more than a dozen pages of historical photos included. Nash is currently talking with the family of former Louisiana Governor John McKeithen about starting work on his next book.

In her most recent work, she gives a voice to those whose voices would have been lost to history without her careful and dedicated research,” said State Librarian Rebecca Hamilton. “She joins a distinguished and varied array of past Louisiana Writer Award recipients from Ernest Gaines, the first honoree, through last year’s recipient, John Barry. It is an honor to present this award to such a truly outstanding writer.” Shaik’s work has appeared in The Southern Review, Callaloo, Literary Hub, The Root, In These Times, and The New York Times and the anthologies N.

Coach Pizz was a walking encyclopedia when it came to the topic of Crowley baseball. Ask him any question about baseball in Crowley during the past 75 years and he could give you the answer along with a colorful and interesting side story. A native of Crowley, Pizzolatto lived in the very house in which he was born. Only 12 years old when Miller Stadium was built in 1948, he felt the stadium was where he actually grew up. As a kid, he sold peanuts in the stadium so he could watch the ball games for free. Later he was a member of the Knothole Gang, whose members paid 50 cents a year for the privilege of sitting along the third base line during the games. In his years at Crowley High he played ball there. Later he played semi-pro ball. After high school, Pizzolatto attended college and earned a degree in Physical Education followed by a Master’s Degree in School Administration and Supervision. After coaching in several nearby towns, Coach Pizz landed his dream job of coaching baseball at his alma mater, Crowley High. After 24 years of coaching baseball and teaching swimming lessons to a generation of Crowley youth, he retired and became the adult recreation director with the Crowley Recreation Department. He was happy to be there but it greatly saddened him to see his much-loved Miller Stadium looking so shabby and rickety. Always the visionary, he approached then-Mayor Isabella de la Houssaye and the city council with plans to restore Miller Stadium and also to improve the city’s youth baseball and softball parks. His catchphrase, “Remember, it’s for the children,” was widely used in the local newspaper and rallied public support for the project. The renovations were completed in 1998, 50 years after the stadium was built, whereupon Pizz became known as the “Godfather of Miller Stadium.” He modestly said that the restoration was the work of many people; but everyone knows that the seed was undoubtedly planted by Coach Pizz. Although pleased with the renovations, Coach Pizz was not finished. In 2000 he organized the first Millers reunion and 75 former players and their families attended. Coach treated them to Crowley hospitality at its best, and the reunions grew and endured through 2010 when the few remaining players were too old to attend. Crowley Post-Signal602 N.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:05 pm Staff Writer The coinstar machine inside of Hubben's Supermarket allows Bitcoin purchase. Cryptocurrency has been a topic ablaze in national news. One of the richest men in the world, Elon Musk tweets about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies often. As of March 2021, Forbes reported Tesla, a company of Musk’s, owned over 40,000 Bitcoin which at that time had a value of nearly 2.5 billion dollars. CSNBC reported in June that while Musk briefly accepted Bitcoin as payment through Tesla in 2021, he stopped in mid-May reportedly due to the effects of mining on climate change. Mining requires a lot of energy to create and store the Blockchains which hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Despite all the attention, the digital assets like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and others are cryptic. There are two ways in which to accumulate these currencies. Mining creates new blocks for the existing chain with computer equipment solving code, while purchasing is acquiring the codes for preexisting blocks. Each block has an identifier and is unique. Buying and trading is done on exchanges but to have the key, transfer off of the exchange is required, say to a digital wallet. Wallet software stores a private key, but the currency asset is still stored on the chain. The block chain is security in that it serves as a public ledger. Investors can see trades in real time, what is being traded and how much exists. This is visible to everyone, but the identity of the owner is anonymous. One of the major issues concerning investments in cryptocurrency is the lack of set value. Luis Interiano, a reference librarian at West Baton Rouge Library has been reading up on cryptocurrency to stay informed for patrons and says, “It’s an agreement, a string of code or electronic bits that exist in a computer.” For some types, the value is agreed upon by investors and not based on any tangible resource unlike a company value in stocks or commodity value. Still, it has been a popular route for investors. One risk for investors is outlined by Interiano’s observation, “Once people start doubting it, it loses its value.” A major concern from the public is the volatility of the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Plus, trading cryptocurrency differs from markers such as the NYSE in that trading never closes. Another censure both from governments and people is the use of these platforms to launder money without detection, as the currencies are not regulated by any government entity. To understand what other concerns or benefits are or could be, the basis for which Bitcoin was created must be understood. The film, Cryptopia was reviewed by Liquid Crypto Blog as one of the most accurate films on the subject. In the documentary, Torsten Hoffmann, one of the two directors, interviews the major players in today’s cryptocurrency technology. While there is truth to the criticism of black market use, it is only taking advantage of the crypto ideals which include decentralizing governance, instantaneous worldwide transfers at any time, and privacy. The room for misuse in such a currency is one side of the coin while the flip side gives an advantage in financial security for people under the control of unjust governments or who live in a country with unstable currency. Bitcoin is programmed to be a fixed supply. At the time Cryptopia was made (2020) there were about 18 million Bitcoin mined. The cap is 21 million Bitcoin. The fixed number of possible units should in theory stabilize the digital asset. However, its ability to be used is still a crucial part of its value. As stated in the film, one of the founding documents of this craze is the 2008 white paper written by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. However, it seems Satoshi Nakamoto is a pen name. No one knows the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. An anonymous founder, a perfect figure head to a decentralized currency. The original nine-page white paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” outlines the aims for Bitcoin. On page two of the document, it states, “We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures.” The model for exchange is based on full disclosure via public ledger, “cryptographic proof” rather than the current system of exchange through banks or other financial institutions which act as a trusted party. The aim of Bitcoin, at least through the lens of Satoshi Nakamoto, was to create a currency which is not regulated by government or banks. Since Bitcoin took off, many other cryptocurrencies were created and use similar technology. In the film, the directors give examples of some big business embracing block chain technology for tracking supply chains, testing use for communication between self-driving cars and manned drivers (BMW), and tokenizing items or services to eliminate middlemen. The film points out the irony of big business harnessing this new technology, as the technology itself was created in part to decentralize control and create peer-to-peer trading. No business in West Baton Rouge currently accepts Bitcoin directly. However, the Coinstar machine inside of Hubben’s Supermarket on North Alexander Ave. allows customers to buy Bitcoin. For this type of transaction, you must use cash (not coins), have a digital wallet set up with coinme.com which requires signing in with a government ID. When the screen prompts the user to insert cash, the current Bitcoin exchange rate will be visible on the screen. The voucher code and phone number entered are used to transfer the Bitcoin into the digital wallet. While the practical application of Bitcoin as a replacement currency isn’t a current reality in town, some other proposed real world uses of block chain technology make use of the unchangeable and traceable nature of transactions. N.F.T.s or “non-fungible tokens” can use the technology as it serves as “a unique digital identifier that cannot be copied, substituted or subdivided” per Merriam Webster. CSNBC reported in March 2021 that Mark Cuban was considering changing ticketing for the Dallas Mavericks to N.F.T.s in the future. One draw to this technology is that the secondary market (ticket resales) of an N.F.T. could still be within the original seller’s profit margin and programmed in from the start. The unique identifier also makes forged tickets less likely. The blockchain technology behind Bitcoin has many possibilities, but the currency isn’t widely accepted in retail and converting it to U.S. dollars is a taxable event. The taxing of Bitcoin as property (asset) has made the use as a currency infeasible. In the film, crypto industry professionals are largely accepting the national limitations legislation can create upon the currency, but the system, which is open-source code stored all over the world holds a value in that it is a permanent record of transactions and ownership that cannot be altered or destroyed. The potential uses of this technology are still unfolding. Staff Writer As I can judge, cryptocurrency is quite convenient for you to get more money. Invest as far as I know.

Approval of the bill, which promises to create legions of jobs and improve broadband, water supplies and other public works, sends it to the desk of a president whose approval ratings have dropped and whose nervous party got a cold shoulder from voters in this past week’s off-year elections. Democratic candidates for governor were defeated in Virginia and squeaked through in New Jersey, two blue-leaning states. Those setbacks made party leaders — and moderates and liberals alike — impatient to produce impactful legislation and demonstrate they know how to govern. Democrats can ill afford to seem in disarray a year before midterm elections that could give Republicans congressional control. Voters “want us to deliver,” Biden said, and Friday\'s vote “proved we can.” “On one big item, we delivered,” he added. Thirteen Republicans, mostly moderates, supported the legislation, while six of Democrats\' farthest left members opposed it. “We dramatically reduced that number. I whipped against the entire package,” House Minority Whip Scalise told Fox News Friday night before the vote. “They brought infrastructure and tied it together with this massive over $4 trillion tax and spend bill sit its one big package and we actively worked against it. …There are no moderates, by the way, they are socialists and liberals and they finally worked some kind of bill together."" Louisiana’s six representatives voted along party lines with Democratic Rep. U.S. Troy Carter, of New Orleans, concurring with the Senate changes, which Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Baton Rouge, helped draft. Republican Congressmen Steve Scalise, of Jefferson; Clay Higgins, of Lafayette; Garret Graves, of Baton Rouge; Julia Letlow, of Start; and Michael Johnson, of Bossier City; were among the 200 Republicans voting against the measure. The 2,700-plus-page bill assigns spending projects to a wide array using a formula. Louisiana Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Baton Rouge, contends favors the state stands to receive a significant portion of $110 billion for roads and bridges; $46 billion that will go in part to rebuild Louisiana’s eroded coastlines and waterways; $65 billion to bolster energy and strengthen the electrical grid from disaster; and $65 billion in broadband to expand internet access. The infrastructure package is a historic investment by any measure, one that Biden compares in its breadth to the building of the interstate highway system in the last century or the transcontinental railroad the century before. He called it a “blue collar blueprint to rebuilding America.” Biden’s reference to infrastructure week was a jab at his predecessor, Donald Trump, whose White House declared several times that “infrastructure week” had arrived, only for nothing to happen. Simply freeing up the infrastructure measure for final congressional approval was like a burst of adrenaline for Democrats. Yet despite the win, Democrats endured a setback when they postponed a vote on a second, even larger bill until later this month. That 10-year, $1.85 trillion measure bolstering health, family and climate change programs was sidetracked after moderates demanded a cost estimate on the measure from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The postponement dashed hopes that the day would produce a double-barreled win for Biden with passage of both bills. But in an evening breakthrough brokered by Biden and House leaders, five moderates agreed to back that bill if the budget office\'s estimates are consistent with preliminary numbers that White House and congressional tax analysts have provided. The agreement, in which lawmakers promised to vote on the social and environment bill by the week of Nov. 15, was a significant step toward a House vote that could ultimately ship it to the Senate. Elated by the bill’s passage, Biden held forth with reporters for over a half hour Saturday morning, joking that his chances of getting the bill done had been written off multiple times, only for him to be able to salvage it. He said he would wait to hold a signing ceremony until lawmakers — Democrats and Republicans who voted for it — return to Washington after a week\'s recess. A House vote on the amendments made to the bill in the upper chamber was stalled for weeks by liberal Democrats who feared moderates, having got what they want, would abandon the now $1.85 trillion Build Back Better Act, Biden’s signature social safety net and climate change bill. After passing the infrastructure bill, the House of Representatives approved a key procedural issue early Saturday morning that guaranteed a vote later this month on the Build Back Better Act. Moderates have forced leaders to slash the roughly 2,100-page measure to about half its original $3.5 trillion size. Republicans oppose it as too expensive and damaging to the economy. “I have done everything in my power to stop the oppressive socialist agenda, the accelerated enactment of the Democrats\' plan to dominate America,” said U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-Lafayette, adding that “no real Republican” would support either measure. “This so-called infrastructure bill is a significant part of that agenda. The bill is 9% roads and bridges and 91% socialist garbage. It’s a losing deal for Louisiana.” The president acknowledged uncertainty surrounding his larger social and environmental spending package, saying “time will tell” whether he can keep popular provisions like universal paid family leave in the final version. He wouldn\'t say whether he has private assurances from moderate Democrats in the House and Senate to pass the nearly $2 trillion bill, but said he was “confident” he would get the votes. Biden predicted Americans would begin to feel the impact of the infrastructure bill “probably starting within the next two to three months as we get shovels in the ground."" But the full impact will probably take decades to be fully realized. He added that he would visit some ports that would benefit from the legislation in the next week, as his administration tries frantically to ease supply chain disruptions that are raising prices on consumer goods before the holidays. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said there\'s a pent-up demand to get going on public works. He told CNN he\'s already got $10 billion worth of applications for a certain program that’s only got $1 billion in it. “This is not just a short-term stimulus bill.” Biden said the investment would be viewed in 50 years as “When America decided to win the competition of the 21st century” with a rising China. The president and first lady Jill Biden delayed plans to travel Friday evening to their house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Instead, Biden spoke to House leaders, moderates, and progressives. U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said Biden even called her mother in India, though it was unclear why. “This was not to bribe me — this is when it was all done,"" Jayapal told reporters. The lawmaker said her mother told her she “just kept screaming like a little girl."" The day marked a rare detente between Democrats\' moderate and liberal wings that party leaders hope will continue. The rival factions had spent weeks accusing each other of jeopardizing Biden\'s and the party\'s success by overplaying their hands. But Friday night, Jayapal suggested they would work together moving forward. The infrastructure measure cleared the Senate in August with bipartisan support. As for the social and environment package, House passage would send it to the Senate, where it faces certain changes and more Democratic drama. That’s chiefly because of demands by Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona to contain the measure’s costs.
