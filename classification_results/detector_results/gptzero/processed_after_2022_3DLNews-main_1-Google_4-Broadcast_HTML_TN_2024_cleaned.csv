'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': ""Sections About Connect With Us Washington — Special counsel Robert Hur issued his report on President Biden’s handling of classified documents from his time as vice president, finding that no criminal charges were warranted. The special counsel said he would have reached the same conclusion even if the Justice Department did not foreclose charges against a sitting president. “We conclude that the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,” the report says. “Prosecution of Mr. Biden is also unwarranted based on our consideration of the aggravating and mitigating factors.” But Hur’s report nonetheless contained significant criticism of Mr. Biden and his handling of classified information. “Our investigation uncovered evidence that President Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen,” the report said. The special counsel’s 345-page report offers a detailed picture of Mr. Biden’s final days as vice president and the years that followed. Classified documents that should have been sent to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) instead ended up in various locations including his homes and offices. Investigators conducted 173 interviews of 147 witnesses — including the president himself. They collected over 7 million documents from both classified and unclassified sources. There were documents marked classified regarding military and foreign policy in Afghanistan and notebooks containing Mr. Biden’s entries about national security and foreign policy matters “implicating sensitive intelligence sources and methods,” according to the report. The special counsel said Mr. Biden’s conduct “present[ed] serious risks to national security, given the vulnerability of extraordinarily sensitive information to loss or compromise to America’s adversaries…But addressing those risks when pursuing criminal charges, the only means available to this office, is not the proper remedy here.” During Mr. Biden’s eight years as vice president, he took notes, some of which were “related to classified subjects including the President’s Daily Brief and National Security Council meetings,” the report state. The notebooks Mr. Biden used were kept in his Virginia and Delaware homes, and he used them as reference material for his 2017 memoir “Promise Me, Dad” and shared contents with his ghostwriter. But the special counsel determined that “the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt” and listed various potential defenses that could demonstrate that the documents could plausibly have been brought to these locations by mistake. “Mr. Biden shared information, including some classified information, from these notebooks with his ghostwriter,” the report said, adding that the ghostwriter deleted audio recordings made for the memoir upon learning of the special counsel’s appointment. “The recordings had significant evidentiary value,” the report said. But the FBI was able to recover the deleted files from the ghostwriter’s computer. The government considered charging the ghostwriter with obstruction but ultimately decided against it based on their findings. Hur’s investigation into Mr. Biden’s handling of classified documents began against the backdrop of another special counsel investigation into Mr. Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 40 federal counts that he allegedly retained classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate and rebuffed Justice Department and NARA efforts to retrieve them. FBI personnel executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago in August 2022 and gathered in all more than 300 documents with classified markings. The former president was charged with illegally retaining 32 of them. Jack Smith was appointed special counsel three months later, shortly after Trump announced his 2024 bid for the White House. Hur’s report explicitly compares Mr. Biden’s response to the federal investigation with former president Trump’s. Where Biden sat for an interview and was cooperative with investigators, “Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite,” Hur wrote. “According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice.” In early January 2023, CBS News reported that classified documents had been found at Mr. Biden’s private office. The White House later disclosed that more documents with classification markings had been found by his lawyers in the garage and an adjacent room of his Wilmington home in mid-December 2022. The special counsel’s report confirms that FBI agents recovered materials from these locations. Hur outlines material distinctions between former President Trump and Mr. Biden in their handling of sensitive documents. In Mr. Biden’s case, the special counsel found there wasn’t evidence that he had personally moved the documents. He cooperated with the investigation, and he may have forgotten about the documents. The Justice Department said that it received Hur’s report Monday evening and submitted it to Congress Thursday. The White House counsel’s office concluded its privilege review of Hur’s report on Thursday morning and told the Justice Department that Mr. Biden declined to assert privilege over any portion, “in keeping with his commitment to cooperation and transparency throughout this investigation,” according to Ian Sams, spokesperson for the office. Hur’s report details the chain of events that led to his investigation, including when Mr. Biden’s personal attorneys found documents with classified markings in his office, his Wilmington, Delaware, garage and basement den. Investigators said they found in a basement cabinet a three-page PowerPoint presentation regarding Afghanistan that bore classified markings and a three-page memo labeled “Top Secret” that was related to Iraq. Between January and June 2023, FBI agents searched over 300 boxes of material from Mr. Biden’s time as a U.S. senator that were stored at the University of Delaware. “Within those boxes, agents found documents with potential classification markings, dating from 1977 to 1991, during Mr. Biden’s service in the Senate,” the report said. Hur’s team looked through all of Mr. Biden’s handwritten notes and submitted 37 excerpts from 109 notebook pages for classification review by the intelligence agencies from which they originated. Prosecutors wrote that some of the handwritten notes contained information about intelligence sources and methods, military programs and capabilities, and “[p]lans and capabilities of foreign terrorist organizations.” Among those excerpts, eight were “Top Secret with Sensitive Compartmented Information,” and seven of the excerpts included information concerning human intelligence sources. Six were “Top Secret,” 21 were “Secret” and two were “Confidential.” The report alleges that during Mr. Biden’s vice presidency, his staff struggled to “retrieve classified briefing books from Mr. Biden” and also stated that he had been instructed on best practices for handling classified information. His use of notebooks and note cards to memorialize various meetings seemed to have complicated those efforts, according to the report. While many of the notecards were properly stored in a security facility with the National Archives, the notebooks were stored in unsecured containers in his home. “Though none of the notebooks have classification markings, some of the notebooks contain information that remains classified up to the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information level,” the report found. Unlike Trump, Biden sat for an interview with the special counsel in October. During the discussion, Hur wrote that Biden said he kept the notebooks because “[t]hey are mine.” “Every President before me has done the same exact thing,” Mr. Biden told the special counsel, according to the report.

Fox News host Tucker Carlson to urge Washington to recognize Moscow’s interests and persuade Ukraine to sit down for talks. Putin also said that Russia stands ready to negotiate a potential prisoner exchange that would free Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was detained last March on espionage charges he denies, and hinted that Moscow wants the release of its agent imprisoned in Germany. Most of the interview, released Thursday, focused on Ukraine, where the war is nearing the two-year mark. Putin repeated his claim that his invasion of Ukraine, which Kyiv and its allies described as an unprovoked act of aggression, was necessary to protect Russian speakers in Ukraine and prevent the country from posing a threat to Russia by joining NATO. Putin pointed at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s refusal to conduct talks with the Kremlin. He argued that it’s up to Washington to stop supplying Ukraine with weapons and convince Kyiv, which he called a U.S. “satellite,” to sit down for negotiations. “We have never refused negotiations,” Putin said. “You should tell the current Ukrainian leadership to stop and come to a negotiating table.” Putin warned that the West will never succeed in inflicting a “strategic defeat” on Russia in Ukraine and rejected allegations that Russia was harboring plans to attack Poland or other NATO countries. It was Putin’s first interview with a Western media figure since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago. White House national security spokesman John Kirby tried to minimize the impact of Carlson’s interview ahead of its release: “Remember, you’re listening to Vladimir Putin. And you shouldn’t take at face value anything he has to say.” In Russia, the interview received wall-to-wall coverage in state media on Friday morning, with major TV channels repeatedly airing excerpts and one state news agency describing it in a column as “a dagger blow through the curtain of propaganda of the dishonest media of the civilized world.” In the days leading up to the release of the interview, Russian Kremlin-backed media also extensively covered Carlson’s visit to Russia, trying to follow him around Moscow and reporting in great detail on where the former Fox News host went. Putin has heavily limited his contact with international media since he launched the war in Ukraine in February 2022. Russian authorities have cracked down on independent media, forcing some Russian outlets to close, blocking others and ordering a number of foreign reporters to leave the country. Two journalists working for U.S. news organizations — The Wall Street Journal’s Gershkovich and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Alsu Kurmasheva — are in jail. Asked by Carlson whether Russia would release Gershkovich, Putin said Moscow is open to talks but repeated that the reporter was charged with espionage, an accusation Gershkovich has denied. “He was caught red-handed when he was secretly getting classified information,” Putin said of Gershkovich, adding that he doesn’t exclude that the reporter could return home. “There is no taboo on settling this issue,” Putin said. “We are ready to solve it but there are certain conditions that are being discussed between special services. I believe an agreement can be reached.” He pointed to a man imprisoned in a “U.S.-allied country” for “liquidating a bandit” who killed Russian soldiers during the fighting in the Caucasus: “He put our soldiers taken prisoners on a road and then drove a car over their heads. There was a patriot who liquidated him in one of the European capitals.” Putin didn’t mention names, but he appeared to refer to Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving a life sentence in Germany after being convicted of the 2019 brazen daylight killing of Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, a 40-year-old Georgian citizen of Chechen ethnicity. German judges who convicted Krasikov said he had acted on the orders of Russian federal authorities, who provided him with a false identity, a fake passport and the resources to carry out the hit. The Wall Street Journal reaffirmed in a statement that Gershkovich “is a journalist, and journalism is not a crime,” adding that “any portrayal to the contrary is total fiction.” “We’re encouraged to see Russia’s desire for a deal that brings Evan home, and we hope this will lead to his rapid release and return to his family and our newsroom,” it said.

Additional requirements fell upon the school district to make. At DCHS, we did not require anything additional while surrounding counties kept more stringent requirements”. “This past semester (fall 2023) we had 130 students taking dual enrollment classes. Out of these 130 students, 43 students made a C/D/F in a dual enrollment class. We are finding that students are signing up for dual enrollment classes who are not ready for the rigor and responsibility required to be successful in these types of classes”. “Motlow offers two different grants for their classes. The middle college grant requires students to keep a 3.0 GPA and the dual enrollment grant requires a 2.0 GPA. This year already, we have had around 10 students lose their grant and this cannot ever be regained”. Request/Recommendation: “After reviewing requirements from surrounding counties, we would like to request that our Dual Enrollment classes have the following requirements beginning Fall 2024. 1.3.0 GPA overall unweighted 2.3.0 GPA in their focus area (Class taken) 3.Students must earn a minimum composite score of 19 on the ACT or Mock ACT in relevant subject areas: a.

Mock ACT and ACT prep classes: “We believe it is very important to expose students to the ACT test early on to prepare them to do their best their Junior and Senior year. All Juniors and Seniors are currently given the ACT at school (on a school day) at no charge to the student. All freshmen and sophomores are given a mock ACT test in the Spring (the same day the Juniors take the real test). Juniors are then scheduled into an ACT prep class their Junior year if they score a 19 or below on the mock ACT test. Our scheduling allows for most students to have multiple elective classes and we feel like this is an important one for our Juniors to take. Beginning in Fall 2024, the English and Reading portions of ACT prep will be administered through the Junior English course which will be a year-long course. The science and math portions will be quarter classes each (totaling one semester course). All Juniors who do not have a real or mock ACT composite of 19 or higher will be required to take this course unless their schedule does not allow for it (ex. special education students who are also in RTI reading and/or math classes)”.

(WATE) — A Blount County deputy was killed in an officer-involved shooting Thursday evening. The suspect was apprehended on Tuesday in Knoxville after nearly five days on the run, U.S. Marshals confirmed. Deputy Greg McCowan was shot and killed during a traffic stop in the 4900 block of Sevierville Road. Deputy Shelby Eggers was shot in the leg and returned fire. She was treated at an area hospital and released. The suspect has been identified as 42-year-old Kenneth Dehart. Warrants have been issued charging him with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and being a felon in possession of a handgun. On Friday, a statewide Blue Alert was issued for him and he has been added to the TBI Most Wanted list. His brother, 41-year-old Marcus Dehart, and 32-year-old Carrie Matthews have been arrested and charged with accessory-after-the-fact. An arrest warrant for Matthews obtained by WATE said that while officers were at her residence, she received a call from a “Janeisha,” but the call was actually the suspect calling from that number. Matthews allegedly told the caller, “they’re here.” Sheriff James Lee Berrong is asking those who live in the Wildwood area with outdoor security or doorbell camera video systems to check for suspicious activity that may have occurred overnight. Tips can also be submitted at 865-981-7125. Berrong shared that the reward for information leading to the arrest of Dehart is now more than $80,000. Agents from the FBI and Tennessee Bureau of Investigation are assisting local law enforcement. Preliminary information from the TBI indicated that the deputies initiated a traffic stop on an SUV in the 4900 block of Sevierville Road in Maryville. However, TBI said the driver identified as DeHart, did not cooperate with deputies and refused to get out of the vehicle. The deputies then used a taser to no effect. TBI said that DeHart pulled out a gun and fired shots, striking both deputies before driving away. This is a developing story.

There was a bombshell report from the Justice Department. It did clear him of criminal wrongdoing and his handling of old classified documents. But special counsel Robert Hur had a lot to say about Biden\'s age and his memory. Before that, Republicans in Congress tanked a bill that could have slowed the number of migrants coming across the southern border. That\'s another one of the president\'s biggest vulnerabilities heading into the election this November. NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram joins us now to talk about how Biden is trying to talk to Americans about these issues. Hey, Deepa. DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Hey, Scott. DETROW: So let\'s start with that report. The president ended his week taking some very uncomfortable questions like this one. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: That\'s... UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Do you know your memory has gotten worse, Mr. President? BIDEN: My memory has not gotten - my memory is fine. My memory - take a look at what I\'ve done since I\'ve become president. None of you thought I could pass any of the things I got passed. DETROW: Look. Deepa, we have both talked to voters, and not just Republicans, who are concerned that Biden is too old for this job. With this report now, how does he deal with this? SHIVARAM: I mean, yeah, this is a tough hill to climb for the Biden campaign because it kind of confirms what a lot of voters are already thinking and feeling, right? We\'ve met Republicans on the trail, Democrats on the trail who have talked about this, who have brought it up before I even could ask about it. So in response, the White House is trying to say that the details here about the president\'s age and his memory are basically irrelevant and inappropriate. Vice President Kamala Harris even said the report was politically motivated. And then at the same time, they\'re trying to highlight the contrast - right? - between Biden and former President Trump because at the end of the day, like you said, Biden isn\'t facing any criminal charges here on how he handled these classified documents versus Trump, who is facing several criminal charges. And they\'re also pointing to Trump and saying, you know, look at his mindset and how many things Trump says that are made up. Just last night, Trump gave a speech, and the Biden campaign sent out a long list of things Trump said in his remarks that they called, quote, ""confused, deranged, lying or worse."" and they really want people to pay attention to that. But polling shows that voters overall are more concerned with Biden\'s age and health than Trump\'s. DETROW: Yeah. And let\'s rewind a little bit. This was one of those weeks where several things seemed like the story of the week. SHIVARAM: So much happened (laughter). DETROW: So rewind, rewind. Let\'s talk immigration. Biden was trying to flip the script on Republicans on another issue where he\'s really vulnerable. And that\'s the border. SHIVARAM: Yeah. DETROW: Let\'s listen to this new message from Biden here. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Every day between now and November, the American people are going to know that the only reason the border is not secure is Donald Trump. DETROW: I mean, for a while of his presidency, Biden wouldn\'t even say the word Trump. SHIVARAM: He wouldn\'t talk about it. Yeah. DETROW: What\'s with the change here? SHIVARAM: Yeah, I mean, Biden had agreed to this bipartisan border security bill - right? - that was supposed to help stem the increasing number of migrants who were coming to the U.S. to seek asylum right now at rates much higher than the current system can manage. And as it became clear that Republicans were going to back out of this bill, Biden started going on offense, like you just heard from that clip. And this has been a big pivot because talking about the border, having a strong message on it has really not been a forte for Biden in the last several months and arguably ever in his administration. Polling shows that immigration is one of his weakest issues, and the most recent NPR/PBS/Marist Poll showed that his approval rating on immigration is very low, at 29%. DETROW: But you\'ll have Trump attacking Biden on immigration, Biden attacking Trump on immigration. How does either message cut through and not just become the Spider-Man meme of two people pointing at each other? SHIVARAM: Yeah, I talked to Alex Conant, who\'s a Republican strategist, about this - yep, with the Spider-Man meme. He used to work for Senator Marco Rubio, and he said that before this week, Biden had no message on the border and was completely playing defense here. And even though he\'s now just blaming Trump, Conant says that that still may get Biden some traction with independent voters and also with Democrats in cities like New York and Chicago, where these mayors are grappling with large numbers of migrants who are looking for shelter and employment. DETROW: Real quick. If Biden gets tougher on immigration with his rhetoric... SHIVARAM: Yeah. DETROW: ...Does he risk alienating a base that needs to show up? SHIVARAM: Yeah. You know, there are some Democrats who are already saying they\'re really turned off by Biden\'s rhetoric here. I talked to one immigration advocate who was saying that it\'s basically going Trump-lite, and they have concerns, both about the concessions that Biden was prepared to make to Republicans and about next steps. They want to see Biden take action and know what he\'s actually going to do on the border besides just point fingers at Trump. DETROW: All this ahead of an election that\'s going to be a pretty narrow contest. NPR\'s Deepa Shivaram. Thanks so much. SHIVARAM: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

The president got choked up while showing a rosary he was wearing on his wrist in memory of Beau, then thundered, ""I don\'t need anyone to remind me when he passed away."" If Biden had left it at that, that might be what people remembered about the news conference. Instead, Biden wound up walking right into the stereotype laid out by Hur when he mistakenly said that President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt was the ""president of Mexico"" while answering a question about current hostage negotiations with Israel and Hamas. It\'s a mistake. Verbal slips happen. Everyone makes them — including Trump, who is only four years younger than Biden. Trump often meanders, recently appeared to confuse his primary opponent Nikki Haley for former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; on more than half a dozen occasions in the past year mistakenly referred to former President Barack Obama when he should have said Biden; and while in Iowa, called ""Sioux City"" ""Sioux Falls,"" which is 90 miles up the road in South Dakota. But because more Americans are concerned with Biden\'s age and fitness to do the job in a second term than they are about Trump\'s age, every time Biden makes a flub it will have more resonance politically. ""It\'s certainly true that anything that feeds the master negative narrative is especially harmful,"" Begala said. ""For [Bill] Clinton, it was cheating, for [George W.] Bush, it was \'dumb,\' Obama \'elitist,\' which is why when Obama said 57 states, it didn\'t hurt him. If it was Bush, it would have."" ""Obviously with Biden, it\'s \'old.\' So, this really really hurts him."" At the White House Friday, Vice President Kamala Harris defended the Biden she sees out of public view, including after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel when Biden sat for hourslong depositions with Hur. ""I was in almost every meeting with the president in the hours and days that followed,"" Harris said, noting that Biden ""was in front of it all, coordinating and directing leaders who are in charge of America\'s national security, not to mention our allies around the globe for days and up until now — months. So the way that the president\'s demeanor in that report was characterized could not be more wrong on the facts and clearly politically motivated, gratuitous."" ""Fair or not, this just amplified Biden\'s greatest challenge,"" David Axelrod, a former senior adviser in the Obama White House, said of the special counsel report. ""It screams through every poll and focus group."" Axelrod went viral back in November for raising whether it was ""wise"" for Biden to run for reelection after a series of swing-state polls showed him losing to Trump. ""Many people have made a judgment about his age and command and discount his accomplishments and attribute every problem to it,"" Axelrod said. That rankles the White House. Democrats don\'t have a clear idea about how to handle the Biden age question or how to package the oldest president in history as a candidate. He\'s not likely to do lots of live TV interviews or massive campaign rallies. And his age raises the stakes for every public appearance, like his State of the Union address in less than a month. Certainly, the pandemic may have conditioned voters to not expect a candidate to do as many events and large rallies as in past elections. That could give the Biden team an opportunity to think creatively about playing to his strengths, in small groups, like when he went to a cookout in North Carolina and went viral. Plus, the economic environment has gotten less dire, Biden is a recognizable brand, and, most importantly, he has an opponent who is, in many surveys, more disliked than Biden and facing much more serious legal troubles. Hur himself pointed out in his report that what Trump is alleged to have done with his handling of classified documents dwarfs anything Biden did. ""Unlike the evidence involving Mr. Biden,"" Hur wrote, ""the allegations set forth in the indictment of Mr. Trump, if proven, would present serious aggravating facts. Most notably, after being given multiple chances to return classified documents and avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite. According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it."" The bottom line is that Trump might not have been charged either if he\'d just given the stuff back. But instead, the whole ordeal highlights why Trump is also so vulnerable politically. He apparently felt the rules didn\'t apply to him, that the boxes upon boxes of classified documents found at his home in Florida should be his to keep and allegedly hid them on purpose and chose not to fully cooperate. It\'s emblematic of why so many see Trump as a threat to democracy. He lied to the country to try to stay in power and schemed to overturn an election he lost, convincing millions falsely that the election was stolen and is using it as fuel for another run. So with nine months to go until Election Day, it\'s doubtful that the Hur report and Biden\'s Mexico-Egypt flub was a turning point in the campaign. ""The president\'s age is not a surprise to anyone,"" said Joel Payne, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Hillary Clinton. ""It\'s not a new data point. He was elected comfortably as a 77-year-old man four years ago. So, in many ways, it\'s baked in. People are not coming to Joe Biden seeking youthful vigor — he\'s been at an advanced age since he was elected vice president 16 years ago. The country turned to him in 2020 to lower the temperature and restore some normalcy, and that\'s happened broadly speaking."" Many Democrats would prefer someone else at the top of the ticket in 2024, and there\'s a deep Democratic bench of possibilities. But there\'s no sign that Biden is stepping aside because, frankly, he doesn\'t seem to want to. The Biden campaign has stepped up attacks on Trump in recent weeks, but outside groups supporting him spent more than $50 million in 2023, mostly on ads touting Biden\'s accomplishments, like efforts to lower insulin prices, pass a child care tax credit and to push for renewable energy. And his approval ratings have only gone down. Biden was elected because of Trump (and his botched handling of the COVID pandemic). Begala said he hopes this week makes Biden and his team sharpen their focus and get fully into an anti-Trump campaign mode, because fundamentally, the frame of this election hasn\'t changed. The question remains, what matters more: Biden\'s age or a dislike of Trump? ""It\'s got to be all about Trump,"" Begala said. ""It\'s the only way. The only way is a wholeheartedly negative campaign."" Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.'}]"
