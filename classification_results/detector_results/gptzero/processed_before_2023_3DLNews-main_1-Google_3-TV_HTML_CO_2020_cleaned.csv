At the event, she called out her opponent, democrat Diane Mitsch Bush, using terms like ‘socialist,’ and saying Mitsch Bush supports progressive initiatives like the Green New Deal. In a KREX 5 exclusive, we caught up with Mitsch Bush to ask her more about her stances on issues important to the progressive platform. She touted her bipartisan record and indicated she is a candidate that can appeal to a broad range of the electorate, and does not support the Green New Deal and Medicare For All. Boebert also pointed out at her Tuesday event that a contrast between her and Mitsch Bush is that she is reaching voters who weren’t reached in the primary, and is adapting to hold in-person events despite the COVID-19 pandemic. In the interview above, Mitsch Bush says she wishes she could hold in-person events, but is sticking to holding virtual events for now, saying it’s more responsible given the public health threat. Also in the interview above, Mitsch Bush discusses her stance on healthcare, saying she wants to keep healthcare affordable and accessible, and lower the cost of prescription drugs, and stands by not supporting Medicare For All, but said in 2018 she supports working towards a universal, single-payer healthcare system. She also tells us her opponent Lauren Boebert would likely vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We asked Boebert’s campaign for comment on Mitsch Bush’s remarks and also to share Boebert’s stance on the Affordable Care Act and thoughts on healthcare, and a spokesperson sent this statement: “This is yet another false attack from Diane Mitsch Bush and her D.C. political hacks. There’s no truth to that at all, so I guess she’s just trying to hide her record of pushing to have the government take over our entire healthcare system.” In May, Boebert told Colorado Politics she’s for free markets, and that health insurance should be able to be purchased across state lines.

""I continue urging my fellow Coloradans to stay home whenever possible. This global pandemic is not a competition about what you think you can get away with. The data we put forth today shows that staying home is crucial to saving lives. These are not statistics on a page, these are your neighbors, your friends, and even your family members,"" said Polis. ""Our community and our economy will come out of this stronger than before but that means everyone must do their part."" As of Friday afternoon, there were 1,734 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 239 hospitalized and 31 deaths. The state has conducted more than 11,000 tests so far. Polis said that there is a delayed effect when it comes to social distancing but that the efforts in Colorado are working. He said it delays the peak and delays hospitalizations. Polis said Colorado has 1,849 ICU beds with half of those needed for non-COVID-19 patients. The goal is to add another 1,000 ICU beds by May, and another 5,000 by this summer. ""That is why we put the stay at home order in place so early, to keep those cases down and return to a normal, free market society and save lives,"" said Polis.
