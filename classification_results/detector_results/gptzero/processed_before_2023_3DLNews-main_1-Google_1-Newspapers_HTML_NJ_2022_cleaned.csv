Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:52 am ROXBURY TWP. – Eisenhower Middle School in Succasunna has joined the ranks of a select group of just 14 middle schools in New Jersey to achieve the designation of a “New Jersey School to Watch.” For the middle school, which enrolls the K-12 district’s seventh and eighth graders, this process was four years in the making starting under the then-leadership of Principal Dominick Miller. The Eisenhower faculty and staff completed an online New Jersey Schools to Watch Self-Study and Rating Rubric, according to a release issued by the district. A critical review of the survey results led to the formation of a “New Jersey Schools to Watch Leadership Committee, “which included teachers, counselors, supervisors, and building administrators. Over the past four years, including changes in leadership with Paul Gallagher taking over as Principal and Jessica Swaim as Assistant Principal, this committee continued to work together to plan, implement, and evaluate school-wide initiatives such as an Advisory program, Responsive Classroom, Readers Workshop, interdisciplinary units, and master schedule revisions. At the same time, student and parent committees were assembled to collect additional feedback and input on these and other programs at the school. All of this hard work, according to the district, culminated in a full-day site visit on Feb. 28 with a team of middle-level leaders and educators from across the state visiting the building. During this visit, students, teachers, and families had the opportunity to share experiences and field various questions from the New Jersey Schools to Watch site visit team. Ultimately, the school was selected for this recognition due to its commitment to academic excellence, developmental responsiveness, social equity, and a commitment to organizational structures and processes that provide all students a pathway to success. Moving forward, this designation connects Eisenhower Middle School to other high-performing middle schools in the state to share best practices with one another. Other “Schools to Watch” in the area include Randolph Middle School, Black River Middle School, Mountain View Middle School, and Byram Township Intermediate School. “We are incredibly proud of Eisenhower’s faculty and staff for achieving this well-deserved distinction,” Gallagher said. “Our teachers, specialists, and support staff work incredibly hard to identify and address the ever-changing needs of the whole child. Everyone is fully committed to the students, families, and to each other. This togetherness has been essential in helping us navigate these past two years, and it will remain essential as we face whatever the feature has in store for us next.” “The Schools to Watch” distinction carries a three-year term, at which point the school will need to re-apply and demonstrate that it has maintained a positive trajectory of continuous improvement.

In the immediate aftermath of the storm, many residents and businesses vowed to rebuild, but some ran out of money despite flood insurance payouts and state and federal aid. Still, 10 years later, the storm has receded into memory for many, and indeed, some areas of the state, including hard-hit areas along the Shore and bays, are experiencing unprecedented growth. In some areas on the coast, modest cottages have been replaced with multimillion dollar mansions. Businesses have also come back with stronger structures arising on boardwalks and main streets along the Shore and in other flood-prone communities. Parallel tracks of successes and disappointments span the state, evident in images taken then and now by NJ Advance Media’s photographers.

Superstorm Sandy destroyed a section of the Mantoloking Bridge that carried traffic from Route 35 onto Mantoloking Road. In what was once described as the “Mantoloking miracle,” the big house surrounded by water on Barnegat Lane managed to survive the storm, with its windows, roofs and siding intact, and only minor damage inside. The bridge and homes have since been rebuilt. The yellow house in Union Beach somehow didn’t collapse even though half of it was washed away in the storm. “We anticipated flooding. We anticipated coming back to a not-so-pretty situation. We did not anticipate coming back to a house cut in half,” said owner Jon Zois said of the home that’s been in his family since 1995. “We only took a suitcase or two full of stuff,” he said of the day Sandy hit. The lot remains empty, but Zois said he plans to build a $500,000 replacement which he hopes to complete by next October. One of the most iconic scenes of Sandy’s destruction was Casino Pier in Seaside Heights, where the pier underneath the Jet Star roller coaster fell into the ocean. The owners vowed to rebuild in the immediate aftermath of the storm, but rather than rebuild over the ocean, they decided to build a pier parallel and to the north of the boardwalk. “It’s going to bring so many people and families back and that’s what Seaside needs,” said a spokeswoman for Casino Pier at the time. A new roller coaster was added to the pier in 2017. A couple who owns a home in Holgate said that a block away from where this car floated down the road and landed, the sand reached higher than their waists the day after the storm. At Carolina Avenue, which was deluged with sand churned inland by the storm, the barrier island is only 0.2 of a mile wide between the ocean and the bay. It was a monumental task to remove the sand from the roads, they said. “It took a long time for them to move the sand,” the homeowner said. “It was something.” Observer Highway in Hoboken was transformed into an inter-city river when Superstorm Sandy struck, with cars partially submerged in water, and nearby businesses and apartment buildings drenched by flooding. Sandy also crippled the PATH rail line in Hoboken, which was knocked out of service for more than a month and a half. The storm caused an estimated $100 million in damage to private property, $10 million to city property and hundreds of millions of dollars to mass transit. When Superstorm Sandy struck, pieces of the famed Atlantic City boardwalk, the oldest in the nation according to the state’s travel website, were ripped apart and washed onto the pavement on New Hampshire Avenue. At high tide two days after Sandy made landfall, some 85 percent of the city was underwater, city officials said at the time. “Twenty eight years on the fire department, I’ve never seen weather this bad,” said Tom Foley, the city’s director of emergency management, at the time. One of the destroyed sections on the north end of town near the Absecon Inlet had been slated for demolition before the storm. Erosion from the storm caused delays in the reconstruction, the U.S. Army Corps said about a year after the storm. In 2018, a new seawall and about a half mile of rebuilt boardwalk reopened to the public at a cost of $38.6 million. Belmar’s boardwalk was completely washed away during the storm, with debris causing damage to cars, houses and utility poles across town. “We had pieces of boardwalk pushed in six city blocks that had to get removed,” then-mayor Matt Doherty said at the time. It cost $8 million to rebuild the 1.3-mile structure in time for it to reopen on Memorial Day weekend in 2013. The intersection of Third Avenue and Route 35 North in Ortley Beach, near the Starlight Motel, was covered with sand and damaged power lines for days after the storm. While the area has been restored, it continues to be threatened from massive beach erosion despite sand replenishment and dune projects. The intense power of Superstorm Sandy made the Camp Osborn area of Brick Township look like a bomb had exploded, with numerous beach houses leveled and streets covered with sand and debris. The storm caused gas lines to rupture, and wind-whipped flames burned down three blocks of bungalows. Some of the other homes were swept away by the massive storm surge. Almost 10 years of cleanup and reconstruction were stalled by legal battles. The Walters development company announced recently that it is scheduled to break ground on Oct. 29 on a major project to redevelop the Camp Osborn site into 67 oceanside residences. The developer said the new buildings will be two-story duplexes that are designed to meet FEMA’s flood guidelines and withstand strong winds. Dozens of large boats traveled down Shrewsbury Avenue in Highlands, damaging homes as the storm raged. Two of the boats landed in front of the home of Regina Yaharat-Splain and Clifford Seay, pictured recently in an embrace on their deck. They said they raised their home more than 10 feet after it was damaged in the storm. More than 83 percent of the borough’s 1,500 homes were damaged in the storm, then-mayor Frank Nolan said at the time. “This town is amazing,” another resident said a year after the storm. “We pull together when we have to, it’s like we’re a big family. I love this town and I would never leave it.” Violent seawater pummeled these ocean-front homes in the Holgate section of Long Beach Island when the first high tide hit, a resident said, but the waters from the bay had reached the properties hours before. The bay water was relatively “peaceful” compared to the whitecaps from the ocean, she said. At the height of the storm, water covered the posts under the homes, but the structures, which were already some six feet or higher above ground level, held and were largely untouched, she said. After the storm, dunes were rebuilt and sand was replenished, but the work has faded with every storm, she said. Superstorm Sandy’s fierce winds and crashing waves turned Whiting Avenue in Manasquan into a scene that looked like an earthquake had hit. In this view from the Whiting Avenue ramp, looking north up the Manasquan beachwalk, the damage was apparent when the high tide receded: crumbled houses, brick steps torn apart, sidewalks buckled and large chunks of the boardwalk ripped into pieces. In Mantoloking, Superstorm Sandy’s powerful winds pushed the Atlantic Ocean over parts of Route 35, allowing water to flow freely into Barnegat Bay, cutting the town in half and creating a new inlet at the base of the Mantoloking Bridge. The west side of Lyman Street provides access to Barnegat Bay, and the right side leads to a beach on the Atlantic Ocean, making the area a prime flooding target. Overall, the raging ocean destroyed about 60 houses in Mantoloking, borough officials said after the storm. Along with torrential rain, Sandy brought fierce winds that toppled thousands of trees around the state. In Newark, the wind speeds hit 78 miles per hour, leaving more than 40,000 homes without power a week after the storm. The home on the right has been sold twice in'}]"

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:52 am The 373,612-square-foot ITC Crossing South shopping center in Mount Olive has been sold to the Black Lion Investment Group, which plans to makeover the center in the coming months. MOUNT OLIVE TWP. – The 373,612-square-foot ITC Crossing South shopping center can expect a makeover now that is has a new owner. The shopping center was sold in December to the Black Lion Investment Group led by 31-year-old real estate entrepreneur Robert Rivani for $49.75 million. The purchase was part of Black Lion’s program to acquire $100 million in power centers throughout the U.S. last year, according to a statement issued by broker Old Bridge-based R.J. Brunelli, who is being retained by Black Lion. As with its prior acquisitions, the Beverly Hills-based Black Lion is developing plans for a facelift and other improvements to the 46.72-acre property, which is located at 10-50 International Drive South just off the intersection of Routes 46 and 80. The mall is anchored by Lowe’s, TJ Maxx, Michael’s, Bed Bath & Beyond, PetSmart and Old Navy, and shadow-anchored by Walmart. “We are beyond enthusiastic about the potential for growth at ITC Crossing South,” said Robert Rivani, president of Black Lion. “In true Black Lion style, we are going to add tremendous value for our current and future tenants by investing in a full scale renovation that has never been seen before in this trade area. We transacted about $250 million in high-quality assets like this one in 2021, and are looking ahead to an even more promising 2022 for Black Lion and those who do business with us.” Danielle Brunelli, President/Principal of the Old Bridge, N.J.-based R.J Brunelli, noted that the property currently has a limited amount of specialty retail space available, including two 1,200-square-foot units that could be combined into a 2,400-square-foot store, as well as a 4,600-square-foot space. She said the firm is in negotiations with a national retailer to lease a large portion of the center’s one available big-box space, the 37,961-square-foot former Babies ‘R’ Us store. Last year, R.J. Brunelli completed leases at the property for the likes of Five Below, AT&T, Amy Murphy’s Salon and Spa, and Rita’s Ice. Five Below and Amy Murphy’s are already open at the site, with AT&T and Rita’s scheduled to follow this year. In rounding out the center’s tenant mix, Brunelli noted that the firm is seeking to add such uses as fast-casual restaurants, furniture, babies and children’s products, outdoor and recreational apparel, sporting goods, electronics, men’s apparel, vitamins, physical therapy, dental, eyecare, waxing, and music. All told, ITC Crossing South serves a population of 246,826 residents within a 10-mile radius whose household income averages $142,115, according to the Brunelli statement. The property also benefits from a daytime population of 228,457 within the 10-mile ring, including 71,398 within five miles of the site, the statement said. Log In BE YOURSELF.

Kolnoski OCEANPORT – The Board of Trustees of New Jersey City University (NJCU) is considering vacating its year-old Fort Monmouth campus as it enacts cost reduction measures following June’s revelation of a financial emergency at the 92-year-old Jersey City-based public institution. As of Tuesday, NJCU’s long-term future at Fort Monmouth remains unclear, with officials saying an exit is possible. “At this time, we still are fully committed to our Fort Monmouth location and the students we serve there,” said Ira Thor, NJCU spokesperson and senior director of university communications and media relations. “Unfortunately, our enrollment at Fort Monmouth dropped from 306 to 195 this year. As we move forward, NJCU will realign programs and focus on its mission of serving the students and families in Jersey City and Hudson County so we can continue helping the state’s most vulnerable population reach the promise of economic mobility through higher education.” The option of leaving Fort Monmouth was part of a presentation from Ben Durant, NJCU’s chief financial officer, during the board’s Sept. 12 meeting when the next steps in the university’s “rightsizing” efforts were discussed. When NJCU’s multimillion-dollar deficit was announced June 27, the board of trustees created an interim budget “to provide a financial structure to support necessary operational and capital expenditures,” the board said. Layoffs began immediately and included Michael Edmondson, Ph.D., dean of the Fort Monmouth campus. Sue Henderson, NJCU’s first female president, resigned the same day. Since then there have been discrepancies over financial figures, with NJCU disputing reports in other media that have been cited by Gov. Phil Murphy. In an Aug. 5 letter to state comptroller Kevin D. Walsh requesting a formal investigation into NJCU’s finances, Murphy referenced news reports that the school went from an approximately $108 million surplus in 2014 to an approximately $67.4 million deficit with $156 million in debt. Those figures, if true, the governor wrote, “are deeply troubling.” At the time, The Two River Times received a statement from Durant disputing the figures and citing the findings of First Tryon Advisors, an external financial advisory firm, stating the published numbers were inaccurate. Simultaneously, state Sen. Vin Gopal, (D-11), chairman of the Senate’s Education Committee, called for a different state university to take over the Oceanport campus, currently in the first semester of its second academic year in Fort Monmouth’s former Squier Hall. According to the minutes of the NJCU Board of Trustees Sept. 12 meeting, total enrollment for the fall semester is 6,354, down from 6,650 in fall 2021. After only one full academic year, NJCU is weighing whether to exit its Fort Monmouth campus, part of the fallout from an institution-wide financial crisis. Courtesy NJCU “The university continues to address the challenges it faces due to the financial emergency,” Thor said. “While we continue to work with our state and legislative leaders, the university has proactively identified approximately $10 million in cost-containment measures… including a 5% reduction in its authorized employee headcount.” Pay cuts to upper management, employee furloughs, and reductions to supplemental instruction have also been instituted, along with budget reductions and organizational consolidation. Tuition and fees were raised and vacant positions eliminated. NJCU is requesting accelerated allotments of its state appropriation and has asked the New Jersey State Legislature’s Joint Budget Oversight Committee for at least $35 million in capital expense funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. Thor said the request for ARPA funding is to address NJCU’s physical plant and infrastructure needs following years of deferred maintenance. The school has identified at least $25.93 million in critical infrastructure needs. Additionally, in October, NJCU will apply for a $15 million Higher Education Infrastructure Trust grant. Gopal said he was informed of NJCU’s proposals by the school. “I appreciate NJCU’s cooperation in moving their future focuses to Jersey City,” Gopal wrote in response to a Sept. 19 email from The Two River Times. “They represent some of the smartest young men and women at their Jersey City campus. Now they can focus their resources toward that campus.” As per the board’s Sept. 12 meeting minutes, “multiple years of operating deficits are the result of shrinking enrollment market/declines in enrollment, the Covid 19 pandemic, increases in institutional aid, aggressive expansion of NJCU’s real estate footprint, and significant growth in academic and athletic programs.” Net position has declined, the minutes state, “due largely to a new pension-related accounting standard required in 2015.” The university anticipates another year of declining enrollment but noted there were gains in the fall 2022 incoming class in Hudson County, including students of color and low-income students, “the core” of the student body.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:52 am BEDMINSTER TWP. – Corporate giant AT&T is preparing to relocate its employees from its massive office complex off Route 202-206 to a much smaller, vacant office building within the township. The workforce will be moving into the former Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals building at 1405-1425 Route 206. “We routinely evaluate our real estate portfolio and adjust it as needed to align with the needs of our customers and the business,’’ an AT&T spokesman told this newspaper on Thursday. “We’re moving the work currently done at 1 AT&T Way to another facility in Bedminster because our lease is expiring. “It’s important to note that these jobs will remain in Bedminster and we remain committed to New Jersey. From 2019-2021, we expanded coverage and improved connectivity in New Jersey by investing more than $1.1 billion in our wireless and wireline networks.’’ The spokesman did not respond to an email from this newspaper asking for a timeline on the transition, and whether any layoffs were planned. The move was paved by the approval of a variance sought by AT&T to use the former Mallinckrodt building by the township’s Land Use Board (LUB) last Thursday. That 233,000-square-foot building has been leased by a number of major corporations over the years, but has been vacant for over a year now. Located in a sprawling 1.1-million-square-foot complex located on 194 acres, AT&T has been a fixture in the township since its networks operation center opened here in March 1977. But its New Jersey workforce has been reduced since AT&T was acquired by SBC Communications in 2005 and its headquarters relocated to Texas. It’s estimated that about 2,000 employees still work here. Although AT&T remained in Bedminster, it sold its property here to Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance in 2006 for $270 million, according to public records. It continued to occupy the site as a tenant. While the site is Bedminster’s largest ratable, the relocation did not come as a total shock to the township – officials here have been preparing for a possible relocation by AT&T for a number of years. The communications firm’s lease with Metlife reportedly expires in 2023. The township had received a grant in 2020 to review possible contingency options in case AT&T moved out. A study of the complex involving county planning officials was the topic of a public meeting last year. Potential options discussed including re-purposing the complex to meet the needs of contemporary high-tech businesses, or possibly “life science” firms with laboratories. At a meeting of the Bedminster Township Committee on Monday night, Aug. 15, Mayor Larry Jacobs said that review remains a “priority’’ for officials. Jacobs said the township “has been engaged with the county about the zoning options for the AT&T campus’’ and has given direction to its Land Use Board to proceed with the review. At the meeting, Jacobs said he was not “making any formal announcement’’ about AT&T’s plans. However, he said he was told by “folks who work there’’ that the company sent out a message to employees saying, ‘Hey, we’ve had a good long run at the AT&T campus – pack your bags we’re moving up the street.’’ “So I don’t have any specific or first hand knowledge that they are completely vacating the AT&T campus but based on the approval, what was stated by AT&T at that board meeting – and the messaging to their own employees – it certainly does seem like they are vacating the campus and it seems like a full relocation,’’ he said. The former Mallinckrodt complex is not “capable of handling up to 2,000 employees’’ at the same time, he noted, and is probably best suited to accommodate between 600 and 700 workers. “But the AT&T schedule has all evolved over the last several years,’’ Jacobs said, especially during the Covid pandemic, with employees working from home on certain days with rotating schedules. “So we are at one point bringing in full tenancy into an empty building,’’ he noted. The township is also “clearing the way for Metlife’’ to work with the town to develop a zoning scheme to “put the property into use and bring great things to Bedminster and our residents,’’ Jacobs said. While Jacobs did not participate in the LUB meeting involving the AT&T variance application, he said had spoken to board members and professionals afterwards and was told that the indication from AT&T was that “folks will start migrating’’ to the former Mallinckrodt complex in 2023. Bedminster had served as the corporate headquarters for AT&T, originally known as the American Telephone and Telegraph Company dating back to 1885. The firm had a near monopoly on long distance service in the nation for decades until the company was broken up into seven independent operating companies as the result of an historic U.S Department of Justice antitrust suit settlement in 1982. When Mallinckrodt first came to Bedminster, the news was hailed by numerous state and local officials during a grand opening celebration here on Oct. 16, 2017. It was reported at the time that an estimated 450 employees would occupy the 30-acre site. But it didn’t last long. By 2021 the drug maker left the site after it was hit with a series of lawsuits regarding the U.S. opioid epidemic, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Known as the Somerset Financial Center when it was first built in 2000, the complex had previously been occupied by Pharmacia and later Dendrite International. ‘We’re All Glad’ The Bedminster Land Use Board approved AT&T’s plan to move into the former Mallinckrodt building after a hearing on Thursday, Aug. 11. As part of its approval, AT&T will install a small communications facility in the rear parking lot. The facility will be just under 12 feet wide, 30 feet long and nine feet high. A 20-foot-high lattice tower will he installed next to it. The planned facility, similar to an existing structure at AT&T’s campus, will be used to test different systems for broadband, phone or 5G. The facility will eliminate five of 1,032 parking spaces, which required a variance from the site’s minimum requirement of 1,040 parking spaces. Project engineer Ron Kennedy told the board that 2,000 employees would technically be assigned to the site, but only 500 or so would be there on a daily basis as a result of flextime and telecommuting. Township Planner Frank Banisch characterized the proposal as “very good for Bedminster, and it’s great for AT&T.” “Yes,” said Board Chair Carol Guttschall, “I think we’re all very glad to have them stay in Bedminster.” BEDMINSTER TWP. – If the massive AT&T office complex off Route 202-206 were to become vacant, what could be done to entice new tenants?

Panic spread as quickly as the virus itself. When the death toll climbed to six or seven a day at an institution that typically saw three or four resident deaths a week, that administrator became the whistleblower who called himself “vetkeeper.” On April 8, 2020, using his pseudonym and an encrypted email service based in Switzerland, he contacted NorthJersey.com to report what he was seeing. “Nearly 40 resident deaths since March 25,” he wrote. “Ten more residents positive, 47 waiting test results ... The public needs to know. I am on the inside. I will keep you posted.” The first story of the deaths at the New Jersey Memorial Veterans Home at Paramus, based on information from “vetkeeper” and other sources, broke that evening. “Vetkeeper” arrived at work the next morning to find two news trucks out front, a helicopter overhead and the National Guard on the way. But in many respects, it was too late. Nearly a third of the residents at the Paramus veterans home would die of COVID or presumed COVID. In all, more than 200 residents died at New Jersey’s two hardest-hit veterans homes — 86 from confirmed COVID in Paramus and 72 in Menlo Park, with another 47 at the two homes presumed to have died from COVID. Now “vetkeeper” has decided to reveal his identity and say more about the veterans home. He is Dave Ofshinsky, former business manager and, for a brief period, assistant CEO for non-clinical affairs at the Paramus home, where he worked for 5½ years. He says he is doing so out of frustration at what has not happened since that initial COVID crisis. “Nothing has happened from the administration [of Gov. Phil Murphy] on this,” Ofshinsky said in a recent interview at his home. “When it was happening, the governor said there was going to be a ‘post-mortem. We’ll get to the bottom of this.’” A recent scathing inspection report on the state veterans home at Menlo Park, a sister institution, only strengthened his views. It cited the home for having COVID infection control lapses that jeopardized the health and safety of all its residents and staff, as well as abuse of a resident. This week, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, threatened to effectively shut down the home saying they would stop paying for new admissions beginning Nov. 22, and stop all payments by March 8 unless ""substantial compliance is achieved."" “All that’s happened has been the payouts to families,” Ofshinsky said, referring to $69 million in state funds to 190 families of dead or sickened veterans to quietly settle their legal claims. Payouts to settle legal claims might bring a sense of closure to some, Ofshinsky said, but “I myself never had a sense of closure that the state has done the right thing to prevent something like this ever happening again.” On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the governor said the Murphy administration “is currently working on a comprehensive and independent construct to review the state’s response during the height of the pandemic."" “The administration will continue to pursue ways to provide the highest quality of care to the residents in state veterans homes in order to protect the health and well-being of our veterans,” said the spokeswoman, Christi Peace. The New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, through its spokeswoman, Maj. Amelia Thatcher, declined to comment. Ofshinsky contacted NorthJersey.com in April 2020 because “I knew, working for the state system, that nothing would happen,” he said in a recent interview. “Bodies would just pile up.” After writing his own post-mortem this fall on the COVID catastrophe in Paramus, he agreed to an interview with two reporters and a videographer at his New York home. “What were the reasons? Why did this happen?” he asked. “Once you know that, maybe you can think about preventing it from happening again.” As business manager at the Paramus veterans home, Ofshinsky was responsible for billing, budgeting, purchases and payments, as well as the operations of the reception desk, security and the information technology department.

Then he obtained a six-week medical leave as a cancer survivor and returned in June 2020. He said he was forced out a year later. Ofshinsky is 66 and a Vietnam-era veteran. A former resident of West Milford who was active in Democratic politics, he served three years on the borough’s Board of Education, as well as on its utilities authority and environmental and economic development commissions. He grew up in Paramus and moved to New York State in April. He compares his veterans home experiences to earlier stints working for nonprofit organizations in behavioral health and for another state agency that oversees child welfare. His sarcasm, when describing what he considers the mediocrity and inefficiency of the state bureaucracy, is biting. While some of his behind-the-scenes factual details are new, such as the cuts made to the medical staff and the vacancy in the Paramus home’s position of infection-prevention coordinator amid the pandemic, it is his description of the panic inside that is most gripping. “Lack of leadership, integrity and transparency has put the staff into a demoralized, panic state,” he wrote in April 2020. The CEO and assistant CEO “spend their days locked in their offices offering no support.” Efforts to reach former CEO Matt Schottlander at his new job were unsuccessful. In Ofshinsky\'s view, the COVID crisis at the state-run veterans homes was the culmination of years of neglect by the division responsible for long-term care of elderly and vulnerable veterans within the state Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. Led by an “old boys network” of military and ex-military insiders with scant experience or training in health care, the homes were culturally and physically ill-prepared to respond to the pandemic, he said. Lack of leadership, skills and preparation allowed the virus to run rampant, infecting residents and staff members alike, as staff worked with inadequate protection and infected, uninfected and untested residents mingled together. In one sign of increased transparency, the homes in Paramus, Menlo Park and Vineland posted their “outbreak prevention plans” online last February. But an extended inspection of the Menlo Park home in August and September found that the most basic prevention strategies were not followed: Testing was not conducted after a new case of COVID was identified last year, and there was no contact tracing. Brig. Gen. Lisa Hou, a physician and combat surgeon with service in Iraq and Afghanistan, has led the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs since October 2020, after the ouster of Gen. Jemal Beale in what Murphy called “a leadership transition” after the worst of the pandemic was over. At the time he fired Beale, Murphy also fired the CEOs of the Paramus and Menlo Park veterans homes, Matthew Schottlander and Elizabeth Schiff-Heedles, as well as their boss, Sean Van Lew, director of DMAVA’s division of veterans health services. Investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office have so far produced no charges, and the state Commission on Investigation has not issued a report on the events.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:52 am ROSELAND - Giuseppe ""Joe"" Leone has been superintendent of the grades K-6 Roseland School District for only a week and his office is beginning to feel like home. A picture of him and his wife, Julianne, sits on the corner of his desk next to his computer along with documents and folders. Three Dallas Cowboys golf balls rest in their packaging next to the photo. The last major change to his office will be a dark blue accent wall, which Leone says matches his love for ""America\'s team,"" and a lighter blue wall to pair with it. He grew up in Livingston and went to school there. While attending grade school and high school, the thought of teaching, or a career in education for that matter, never entered his mind. ""I had a very positive experience going through the Livingston School District. I had great teachers that I remember, and I have a big family and cousins that went through the district,"" he said. ""I was at Montclair State and my major was political science, I thought I wanted to get into some kind of law enforcement, so I graduated with my political science. I minored in criminal justice. ""But my senior year, just to have something to do, I started substitute teaching in the Newark Public Schools. And really that\'s when my idea of wanting to be a teacher really developed. And I said, this is what I want to be doing. And I only subbed at the elementary level, and that\'s what really got me into education. ""Once I started subbing in the Newark schools, I said, \'Teaching is for me,\' and I forgot about any idea of going into law enforcement."" Can Have Impact Leone was a substitute teacher at Roberto Clemente Elementary School in the North Ward of Newark. ""For me, just being around the students, there\'s just so much energy in an elementary school and just having them react to me in a positive way, I really felt like, \'Wow, I can have an impact on these students for the rest of their lives.\' And just the energy of being around kids really developed the idea for me."" Leone graduated with a bachelor\'s degree in 2001 and went right back to school at St. Peter\'s University in Jersey City. He went through their alternate route program to get a teaching license and was able to pursue his new career path after a year. ""(The alternate route program) was meant for people who were in the different professions who wanted to be teachers. (They) would have to secure a job in the district and then take classes at night in order to get the educational requirement,"" he said. ""I would go to classes at St. Peter\'s at night, and I think it was once a month on a Saturday. After a year of that, I had my standard teaching certification."" He received a master\'s degree in educational leadership from St. Peter\'s University. While taking courses for his master\'s, he was teaching second grade at Clemente. ""You have to be offered a position by that district. Like today, there was a bit of a teacher shortage (then) so inner-city schools were looking to bring in people even though we didn\'t have any experience, knowing that we would gain the experience and gain what we needed to learn at classes at night."" He taught in Newark for seven years. While applying for administrative jobs in New Jersey, he interviewed to become a vice principal at Alpine Elementary School in Sparta. ""I had my administrative certification, and I had tried to obtain a vice principal position in Newark that wasn\'t working out. ... I began to interview in other districts, and in the summer of 2008, I interviewed for the vice principal position at Alpine Elementary School, and I was fortunate enough to be offered that position and be exposed to the administrative positions now in education."" Leone became the principal at Alpine after three years as the vice principal. As vice principal, he was able to observe what the principal was doing. ""(The vice principal role was) more of interaction with the students, covering lunch duty, being outside for recess, arrival and dismissal of students, and having that interaction with the parents at those times,"" he said. ""Whereas as the principal, it was more of the managing of the building and making sure that all of the people that were under my charge were ... getting their jobs done."" Roseland Opening After some time as principal, Leone had started looking to climb the career ladder again. When a listing for Roseland superintendent popped on his screen, he knew it was a job he could really excel in. ""When I saw the job posting, it really caught my eye because the structure of the school being a PreK though 6th, all of my experience in education has been with elementary. I\'ve never been at a middle school or taught or as an administrator in the high school level. So I really felt like this would be the perfect opportunity."" He was introduced as the superintendent in a Board of Education meeting June 23. Various mentors and previous superintendents have congratulated him on the new position along with giving him advice, he said. Leone hope to accomplish a lot in his first year as superintendent. ""I think the focus for me is establishing a culture where people want to come to work, where the kids are coming in and they\'re enjoying coming to school, learning. Teachers and all support staff are supportive of those efforts, feel like they are being supported,"" he said. ""They have the resources that they need, that they are able to do their job. I look at my job as providing the teachers and all of the staff what they need to be supportive for students and doing it in a positive way in a place where they enjoy coming to.""

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:52 am EVA TURBINER In this photo from a previous celebration, Zufall Health CFO Eva Turbiner, third from left, poses with the late Sen. Anthony Bucco, R-Morris, Dr. Robert Zufall and then-Assemblyman and now state Sen. Anthony Bucco. Turbiner is retiring from Zufall after 16 years as president and CFO. DOVER – Zufall Health’s 16-year president and chief executive Eva Turbiner is set to retire at the end of the year. According to Zufall Health, Turbiner, has transformed what was a tiny clinic into a nationally recognized health center that now serves more than 41,000 underserved patients in seven New Jersey counties. Turbiner, whose career as a health care executive spans more than three decades, said she will leave the organization at year’s end. “Eva’s vision and expertise have turned a small, volunteer operation into a vital and thriving organization that makes affordable, quality care accessible to tens of thousands of vulnerable people,” said Michael O’Donnell, chairperson of Zufall’s board of directors. “We are grateful for her many years of dedicated leadership and wish her well in her retirement.” The executive search firm WittKieffer has been hired to conduct a national search for Turbiner’s successor. “It has been the honor of my life to work here,” she said. “I am so proud of the organization we are today and its recognition as a trusted advocate for the uninsured of New Jersey. I am also grateful for the support of our dedicated board of directors, our talented staff, and the many dependable partners who helped improve the health of the patients and communities we serve.” When Zufall Health began in 1990, its founders – a retired urologist and his wife – envisioned a modest, one-night-a week clinic to serve the poor. “My late wife, Kay, and I didn’t think much beyond Dover in those days,” said Dr. Robert Zufall, who at 98 remains a member of the health center’s board of directors. “I feel so grateful we found Eva. She wanted to expand to Morristown, Hackettstown and beyond – way beyond. She saw the possibilities.” Under Turbiner’s direction, Zufall has grown to 10 clinical sites across Morris, Sussex, Essex, Somerset, Hunterdon, Warren, and Middlesex counties. This region – covering roughly one-third of the state — encompasses the largest service area of any of New Jersey’s 23 other Federally Qualified Health Centers. Turbiner now oversees a budget that approaches $50 million and a workforce that exceeds 400 professionals and support staff. Recognized as a Patient-Centered Medical Home by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, Zufall has become the medical home to low-income patients who receive industry-leading, quality care and award-winning, innovative services, many of which have become national models of care. Advances under her leadership include the opening of the Zufall Wellness Center and initiatives to expand health care access to all underserved patients including rural and public housing residents, farm workers, and people experiencing homelessness. This commitment led to the launch of mobile medical, dental, and nutrition programs and the impending opening of Zufall’s first school-based health center in Franklin Township. Accomplishments also include establishing an AmeriCorps program, providing clinical pharmacy services, developing on-site training programs for new physician assistants, dentists, and dental assistants, and creating the Zufall Health Foundation. Her tenure also included formidable challenges from storms, floods, complicated renovations, and the nearly catastrophic COVID-19 pandemic, which threatened the health center’s financial survival. But under Turbiner’s stewardship, the health center reinforced its position as a leading community resource by remaining open each day throughout the crisis. Along with maintaining care for its underserved patients, Zufall expanded services to provide testing and vaccination programs for patients and the community at large. As she continues positioning the 32-year-old health center for successful, long-term growth, Turbiner says she remains committed to working with her successor to ensure a seamless transition. Zufall Health is an award-winning, not-for-profit, state-licensed community health center that has been providing high-quality, affordable medical, dental, and behavioral health services to low-income, uninsured, and underserved people for 32 years. More than 41,000 patients are served at its headquarters site in Dover as well as medical and/or dental offices in Morristown, Hackettstown, Flemington, Somerville, West Orange, Newton, Plainsboro, and on its Highlands Health Van and Zufall Health Delta Dental mobile.

their home field for the first time this season on Tuesday, March 21, in a game against the Haverford Fords. “It was great,” junior Dylan Maria said. “Florida was a great trip, great weather, but it’s always good to be back at home playing the home opener in front of everyone.” Just like the weather down in Florida, the Profs’ offense was hot on Tuesday, plating 21 runs en route to their 21-5 victory. The scoring got started early, as both Maria and senior Chris Curcio recorded RBI singles in the bottom of the first inning to give the Profs an early 2-0 lead. Haverford, however, would threaten just an inning later. After the Fords put runners on second and third with just one out in the top of the second, southpaw pitcher Zach Grace was able to get out of the jam and allow no runs. First, the junior transfer from the University of Wake Forest forced a weak ground ball to third base, which got the runner on third to head home and get gunned out by Anthony Schooley for the second out. Just a few moments later, Grace fired a nasty pickoff move over to first base to catch the runner sleeping and end the inning. From there, it was all Rowan, as the team sent all nine batters to the plate and put up a five-spot in their half of the second inning to swing the momentum heavily in their favor. “It’s just a killer for the other team,” sophomore Jason Morgan said. “They had a big inning, and then we shut them down and came right back out and stepped on their throats, and that was it from there. I thought it was a huge momentum switch for us.” Grace settled in from there and gave the team five strong innings, allowing two unearned runs on three hits and five walks. Grace also struck out five. Although the offense exploded, the Profs’ defense and pitching was an issue that haunted them all day long. The team committed three errors in the field, and the pitching staff gave up 12 walks, hit two batters and threw three wild pitches. “I think we need to be better on the mound, we obviously didn’t throw enough strikes,” Head Coach Mike Dickson said. “In a 10-1 game at one point, there’s no reason why we should be hitting or walking guys. It allowed them to get back in the game a little bit and make it 10-5, so obviously that needs to be better.” As Coach Dickson alluded to, Haverford was able to score two runs off a single in the seventh inning and cut the Profs’ lead to five. That was largely a result of Rowan committing an error, walking two batters and then hitting one more. “We gotta continue to practice,” Dickson said. “The monotony of practice, taking ground balls,making sure our technique is right. It was sloppy, sloppy out there today.” Five runs was the closest that Haverford would come to tying it, as the Profs were able to score four runs in their half of the seventh and seven in the eighth to blow the Fords out of the water. Three of the Profs’ four seventh inning runs came off Morgan’s bat, as he hit an opposite field home run. It was nearly all for naught, however, as a deke by Haverford’s right fielder nearly wiped away the play. “The umpire thought he had it, and then I was running around the bases and saw that it fell out of his glove, so I was like ‘alright I must be good,'” Morgan said. “So I was telling the umpire, they talked it over and everything was good. I had to go back to first, that’s never happened to me either, but I’ll take it.” After scoring over 20 runs for the second time this season, the Profs’ offensive approach is working like a charm. “Just trying to be patient, stay up the middle, line drives and stay to the right side,” Morgan said. “When we’re pulling off, it’s not good baseball for us and we’re staying on the ball, staying through everything that’s when we do the best. That was our approach today, we got our pitches when we had them and we took the right pitches, and everything was going our way today.” The plate discipline was obvious for the Profs in this one, as Rowan drew 14 walks to accompany their 20 hits and keep the lineup moving. “It’s a great time in the dugout when we know that we can get our third at-bat in by the fourth inning, when usually most games, it’s in the back half of the game,” Maria said. “When we’re locked in, I feel like it’s a great time in the dugout.” The Profs will look to stay hot offensively as they head to Aston, PA on Wednesday, March 22, to take on Neumann University.

This year, The Rowan University Foundation was one of the ten $1 million grant recipients across the United States and Canada for the TD Ready Challenge because of their new Green Jobs Academy initiative, which is currently in development. The TD Ready Challenge is a program that selects nonprofits and organizations that are seeking to combat climate change and winners are rewarded with a generous grant. Green Jobs Academy is a new program that will offer training and education to its students and will prepare them to work in the solar and wind power industries. The academy will also be building an educational wind turbine to provide students with a hands-on learning experience. This turbine will be a full-size land wind turbine, but students in the program will also be trained to work in the offshore wind power industry. Offshore wind farms are a sustainable energy initiative that has been a hot topic in New Jersey recently. While many people are excited about how offshore wind can be used to combat climate change, others believe that it may be harming beachside communities and ecosystems. Some people have speculated that the wind farms could be contributing to the increase in whale deaths along the East Coast, despite the fact that there has not been much evidence that these two are correlated, according to the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC), a government organization designed to protect marine ecosystems. In a statement that went out on Feb. 21, the MMC announced that “Despite several reports in the media, there is no evidence to link these strandings to offshore wind energy development.” Rowan’s Green Jobs Academy is an initiative that will offer South Jersey residents the opportunity to train to work in the industries of solar and offshore wind energy. These hands-on programs will allow students to obtain certificates that help them get jobs in these industries as well. Jennifer Totora, the Marketing & Events Specialist of the Rowan School of Earth & Environment. Totora was also the person who wrote the grant for the project. “For example… people would be hands-on learning how to repair and install photovoltaic systems, like really big solar panel fields, right? Or they would actually learn how to get up into the wind turbines and be one of those people who climb up there and repair them,” Totora said. The $1 million grant will be going towards building the wind turbine, getting equipment for students, providing scholarships, and for the certifications that the program will have. The certificate programs will start off at the community college level, one of the partners for the project being Rowan College of South Jersey (RCSJ). The program will also target students who may not be looking to attend a four-year school like Rowan. There is not a set curriculum yet, as the program is still new and being developed. “For it to be most accessible, we really probably are going to emphasize it a little bigger at RCSJ in the early days, and then build toward opportunity, certifications, and certificates here at Rowan University,” said Eddie Guerra, associate dean of the Rowan School of Earth & Environment. The Green Jobs Academy will also allow students the opportunity to get a high-paying job without a four-year bachelor’s degree. “The fact that these are really good paying jobs with just a certification I think is really attractive to some people. A photovoltaic technician can make $45,000, or wind turbine technician can make $60,000,” Totora said. The idea for the initiative came after the pandemic when many oil refineries and energy jobs were shut down in Paulsboro, a South Jersey town approximately 12.5 miles from Glassboro. In late 2020, construction on the Paulsboro Marine Terminal began, which created a state-funded manufacturing facility for wind turbines. This opened up a lot of job opportunities for people in the area. “We saw""}]"

Sign up for email newsletters E-Edition PRINCETON — For the better part of three seasons, Keeshawn Kellman had given his Princeton men’s basketball coaches and teammates glimpses of a powerful force ready to be unleashed.It was just yet to happen when the lights actually went on and the cameras were rolling.That is until now.Kellman made an immediate impact in the Tigers’ season opener when he scored 21 points on 9-for-9 shooting with four dunks in 26 minutes.“He gets us easy baskets and it’s very hard to stop him down there,” senior forward Tosan Evbuomwan said. “We all know that.”Even though he’s a senior, Kellman, in many ways, is a new addition to the roster. Prior to Monday night’s opener, he had played in just 18 games in two seasons after the Ivy League canceled his sophomore year because of Covid and injuries limited to eight appearances as a junior.Getting back into shape was the most challenging part. Because of the injuries, he was, by his own admission, overweight.“The whole spring and summer I focused on a lot of conditioning,” he said. “I was very overweight at the end of the season and that was one of the points of emphasis that I had. I thought just doing that along with my overall game, finishing around the basket, just my IQ watching a lot of basketball.” That work looks to have paid off.At 6-foot-9, 240-pounds, the Allentown, Pa., native is no small kid, but he looked agile and light on his feet. He showed good touch around the basket and dunked the ball regularly and with authority.“You got a glimpse of what we’ve seen for four years,” coach Mitch Henderson said. “He’s worked so hard, he lost a lot of weight. I thought he was unbelievably good (against Hofstra). He affected the game on both ends of the floor. He was 9-for-9 from the field, five rebounds in 21 minutes. I thought he was terrific.”One of the question marks ahead of the season was whether Kellman and Evbuomwan, the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year, could play together since neither is a threat to make a 3-point shot and the Tigers’ offense last season was centered around Evbuomwan as a point-center with shooters spaced around him.They showed they can be an effective duo with either Kellman posting up or in the dunker’s spot ready to receive a pass or crash the offensive glass.“I love playing with Tosan,” Kellman said. “He’s a really skilled player. He’s very unselfish and he finds the open guy, so it makes the game easier on all of us. The more we play with each other, the more chemistry we’ll build.”Kellman’s 9-for-9 marked the second time in program history that somebody has made that many shots without a miss. The only other time it happened was when Barnes Hauptfurer was 11-for-11 on Dec. 7, 1974 against Notre Dame.“It felt good to be back out there with the team,” Kellman said. “…It was definitely something new, but it’s something I’m going to have to adjust to and push through any fatigue I feel.”Princeton GamedayWHO: Princeton (0-1) at Navy (1-0)WHEN: Friday, 8:30 p.m., Alumni Hall, Annapolis, Md.TV/ RADIO: CBS Sports Network/ The Varsity NetworkLAST TIME OUT: Princeton lost to Hofstra, 83-77; Navy def.

Princeton was done in by untimely turnovers and an uncharacteristic poor shooting performance. After ranking among the top nationally in 3-point shooting percentage and makes last season, that may be an area of concern this go round. Other than Ryan Langborg, who had a tough shooting night in the opener but was 40% on 3s last season, there isn’t another player on the roster who scares you from beyond the arc the way there was a season ago. Tosan Evbuomwan picked up right where he left off with 22 points, seven rebounds and three assists in the curtain raiser.SCOUTING NAVY: Ed DeChellis’ Midshipmen went 21-11 last season and looked good in a 15-point victory over William & Mary in the opener. Tyler Nelson led four players in double figures with 16 points. Nelson shot 6-for-9 from the field, including 4-of-6 from beyond the arc. Navy, as a team, shot 47.6% on 3s (10-for-21) and held its opponent to 28.6% (6-for-21). Daniel Deaver and Sean Yoder both contributed 14 points to the victory.

A demolition company, Catco Demolition of Montville, is in the process of tearing down a three-story brick office building at 147 Columbia Tpke. that formerly housed a medical center. The roughly five-acre site is located across Hanover Road from the 7-Eleven convenience store and the rear of the Florham Park Roller Rink. The developer behind the apartment plan is Palmont Associates, a limited liability company affiliated with Short Hills developer Garden Homes. The plan calls for the construction of 126 apartments across two buildings, including 25 affordable units, as per the terms of the borough’s third-round affordable housing settlement with the Fair Share Housing Center advocacy group. The complex, dubbed the “Palmont at Florham Park,” will include one-, two- and three-bedroom units, with all three-bedroom units set aside as affordable. The Planning Board approved the developer’s application in January 2020. The Borough Council entered into a developer’s agreement with the builder the next month. A Catco Demolition employee said Saturday it would take a few more days to demolish the existing buildings, and about a week to recycle the concrete. The Garden Homes marketing department did not immediately respond to phone inquiries as to when construction would begin and when the Palmont at Florham Park is expected to open.

Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks USA TODAY reached out to Occupy Democrats and other social media users who shared the claim for comment. Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows abortion-related deaths still have occurred in subsequent years but in low numbers. The CDC defines legal induced abortions as those a licensed clinician performs within state law and illegal abortions as those performed in any other cirumstances. Fact check:Photo of Ginni Thomas with expensive wine is from 2018, not after Roe v. Wade leak Abortion deaths for both categories dropped sharply in the mid-1970s and have remained low since, according to CDC data. From 2011 to 2018, the CDC reported two to six deaths per year from legal abortions and one total death from an illegal abortion. In terms of rate, the latest data showed 0.41 deaths per 100,000 abortions from 2013 to 2018. The Roe decision was a key driver in this decrease, Mary Faith Marshall, director of biomedical ethics at the University of Virginia, told USA TODAY. ""Abortion became part of care provided under an accredited health care system with safety standards,"" Marshall said. ""Clinicians had to be trained to perform abortion procedures in a formal way."" Women were also protected in their right to get abortions during the first trimester of pregnancy, which reduced their risk of mortality, Marshall said. The abortion-related deaths still occurring are typically due to rare complications and demographics who can\'t afford medical care, Amanda Jean Stevenson, a sociologist at the University of Colorado, told USA TODAY in an email. Even before Roe v. Wade, the number of abortion-related deaths was steadily declining, Dr. Karen Meckstroth, an obstetrician and gynecologist at the University of California, San Francisco, told USA TODAY in an email. A 1978 study found that ""deaths from abortion declined more rapidly than deaths from other causes associated with pregnancy and childbirth"" between 1940 and 1975. This was attributed to various factors, such as increased availability of legal abortion and more effective contraception, according to the study. Fact check: False claim about \'domestic supply of infants\' and draft Supreme Court abortion opinion Abortion mortality decreased when antibiotics such as penicillin became widely available in 1945, which increased the safety of the procedure, Dr. Lisa Harris, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Michigan, told USA TODAY in an email. Abortion-related deaths also declined as a result of states repealing and changing anti-abortion laws, proving wider access to safe procedures. Meckstroth said that by the end of 1970, four states had repealed their anti-abortion laws, and 11 states had changed them. Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that Roe vs. Wade marked the end of women dying from abortions. Abortion-related deaths still occurred after the landmark decision, though there was a sharp decline. This downward trend in abortion mortality began before 1973, and Roe contributed to it, experts said. Thank you for supporting our journalism.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:52 am BERNARDS TWP. – The Basking Ridge Country Club has been sold for $6 million to a organization that owns and operates a number of prestigious golf courses across the nation. The prior owner, Basking Ridge Country Club Inc., and Basking Ridge Golf Course, Inc., sold the 260-acre property at 185 Madisonville Road to HGC Basking Ridge, LLC, on Jan. 20, according to the property sales records. The prior owners, the Mahan family, have also long owned the Millington Quarry Inc. (MQI) property on Stonehouse Road. Heritage Golf Clubs (HGC), is a division of Virginia-based Heritage Golf Group, which owns numerous upscale private country clubs. The Basking Ridge Country Club features an 18-hole private golf course, a public restaurant called the Delicious Heights Outpost, a banquet and catering facility and a club with golf and swim memberships. Messages left with MQI and the country club seeking information on the transaction and any future changes in the operation were not returned by Monday night. An email sent by this newspaper to the new ownership group was also not returned. ‘Prestigious Collection’ According to information on its website, https://www.heritagegolfgroup.com/clubs/, the the Heritage Golf Group’s “prestigious collection of golf properties have won numerous awards and continue to garner praise and rave reviews within our portfolio of well-known and acclaimed golf properties spanning South Carolina, Florida and Virginia.’’ The club currently lists 18 courses on the website. Five are located in Florida: TPC Prestancia in Sarasota, TPC Tampa Bay in Lutz, The Club at Boca Pointe in Boca Raton, The Club at Pelican Preserve in Fort Myers, and the Venetian Golf Club in North Venice. Another three are on Hilton Head Island, S.C., including the Oyster Reef Golf Club, Port Royal Golf & Racquet Club and Shipyard Golf Club. In addition to the Basking Ridge club, two other courses are located in New Jersey, the Shackamaxon Country Club in Scotch Plains and Stanton Ridge Golf and Country Club in Whitehouse Station. It also has two courses in Virginia, The Dominion Club in Glen Allen and the 1757 Golf Club in Dulles, and two in Illinois, Boulder Ridge Country Club at Lake in the Hills and White Deer Run Golf Club in Vernon Hills. The remaining courses include: The Knollwood Country Club in Elmsford, N.Y., The River Club of Mequon in Mequon, Wis., and WingHaven Country Club in O’Fallon, Mo. Club History The Basking Ridge Country Club first opened as the Pennbrook Golf Club course on July 2, 1926. The course was developed on William D. Bancker’s Willmary Farm. The farm had been owned a few years earlier by John C. Spooner (1843-1919), a former U.S. senator from Wisconsin. Bancker’s designer was Alexander Findlay. According to an article in this newspaper on July 23, 1925, Bancker intended that the “links here will be used as a community course, open to those of modest means.” Club membership was limited, but anyone could play “upon paying a reasonable charge for the day’s use of the course.” Bancker died in November 1940 and the club ownership was passed on to his sons. Two years later, when World War II brought on gas rationing, Pennbrook was closed and turned into a cow pasture-cornfield. It stayed that way until May 1953. Then, this newspaper reported, a group headed by Edward V. Murray “harrowed the corn out of the fairways, chased the cows out of what was once the clubhouse locker room, and opened for business.” Pennbrook remained open to the public for many years but suffered a setback in August 1976 when its clubhouse burned down. Membership dropped off and the golf course itself was plagued by poor drainage conditions. On Aug. 4, 1977, this newspaper reported that Pennbrook was finally making improvements after being “long the brunt of bad jokes about grass-less tees, poor fairways and greens.” It said the course was once deemed “a duffer’s paradise” in an area newspaper survey. In November 1979, Murray’s nephew, Robert Adams, sold the club to a group of businessmen for $2 million. New owner Robert McCabe oversaw the construction of a new club building but was then arrested on stock fraud charges. As a result, Pennbrook went bankrupt in August 1982. Trustees then sought to sell Pennbrook for development purposes to pay off creditors. In February 1984, Edhill Co. of Livingston offered to buy the property for $6 million if it could get a development plan approved by the Board of Adjustment. Edhill pursued a plan for 99 homes, then a proposal for an executive conference center, and then a third plan for 128 homes before the deal expired in February 1986. In October 1986, Gary Mahan, a Basking Ridge resident and owner of MQI, bought the club at a public auction for $5.3 million. He then changed its name to the Basking Ridge Country Club and began offering one-year memberships. Mahan went on to invest more than $2 million to upgrade the course with additional bunkers, trees and drainage improvements. In the meantime, township officials sought to acquire the property and obtained a $7.5 million state Green Acres aid package. But in July 1992, after talks with Mahan failed to produce an agreement, the Township Committee voted to end its effort and return the state aid. Concerts, Dining The course is not known to have had many celebrities play a round of golf. One of the few was New York Giants football coach Alex Webster, who played at Pennbrook in June 1970 as part of the inaugural “Countryside Ford Golf Classic.” The club’s biggest celebrity appearances involved musicians who performed outdoors in the summer of 1988. A concert featuring the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band drew about 500 people and was followed by concerts headlined by Judy Collins and Dave Mason. The series led neighbors to express concerns at a Township Committee meeting, with one neighbor predicting “another Woodstock.” But police said the initial concert was orderly, and the committee saw no need to act. Most of the club’s public exposure has been through its restaurant. Pennbrook obtained a club liquor license in 1934 and a consumption liquor license in 1952. The current clubhouse and restaurant building opened in September 1981. The dining facility was occupied by the Ironwood Restaurant from the late 1980s until 2003 when Growth Restaurants, Inc., signed a lease and opened the Bamboo Grille. The Bamboo Grille’s outdoor bar featured live entertainment on weekend nights in the late spring and summer, and became very popular. But in June 2011, complaints from neighbors about noise led the Township Committee to ban amplified music at the bar. Musical acts became more subdued. Two years later, Mahan executed a buyout clause in the lease, leading the Bamboo Grille to close on Oct. 26, 2013. Renovations ensued, and the restaurant reopened as Delicious Heights Outpost on Nov. 13, 2013. Operated by the owners of the Delicious Heights restaurants in Berkeley Heights and Bedminster Township, it remains in place today. A manager at the restaurant on Friday declined to comment on the sale of the club.

baseball team took a violent and unexpected turn last week when the young pitcher caught a line drive to the temple. The boy was knocked unconscious by the blow and was airlifted to Albany Medical Center, where he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Although Anthony’s condition currently is stable, the road to recovery could still be a challenging one. “His mother and I saw it happen,” said Anthony’s father, Ron Labin, speaking with The Westfield Leader shortly after the accident. “It was instantaneous. That ball came at him so fast that there was no way he could have ducked out of the way. It was heartbreaking.” Anthony was severely concussed by the impact, Mr. Labin said, which caused a dangerous amount of swelling in his brain. Doctors removed part of Anthony’s skull to try to alleviate some of the pressure. “It’s still so early that we don’t have a real prognosis yet, but we’re hopeful that he’ll make a full recovery,” Mr. Labin said. “The doctors here have been wonderful, but this whole thing has felt like one big nightmare. I just want to tell my kid that everything is going to be okay, but we just don’t know.” The accident occurred on July 11, during a tournament held each year at Cooperstown Dreams Park in Cooperstown. According to Anthony’s coach, Roger Askins, the response to Anthony’s accident, both by the facility itself and the tournament organizers, was “severely lacking.” “When Anthony got hit, his neck cracked backwards, hard,” Mr. Askins said. “It was terrifying. We had been told that there would be medics and an ambulance on site, but there was nothing there other than an understaffed infirmary.” The weeklong tournament, Mr. Askins said, attracted approximately 1,000 participants along with countless spectators. “In a crowd that big, you would think they would be prepared for an emergency, but they really weren’t. It was very disorganized, very chaotic,” Mr. Askins said. “When Anthony got hurt, somebody came out with a [spine board] and got him strapped down, but then they tried to load him on to a golf cart to get him to the infirmary instead of just calling for an ambulance right away. It was handled really poorly. It took at least 45 minutes for an ambulance to show up, and I honestly think it was because nobody called.” Anthony was originally transported to a nearby medical facility but was quickly airlifted to Albany when it became apparent that the local center was not equipped to handle such a serious head injury. He will remain under the care of Albany Medical Center until his doctors feel that he can safely be moved closer to home. So far, Mr. Labin said, Anthony has been able to demonstrate full mobility in his arms and legs, but has had some trouble speaking. “The doctors told us that he was hit in the part of the brain that controls speech, and it may just take some time for him to be able to heal,” Mr. Labin said. “Part of the reason that they did the operation was to limit the potential for brain damage. It’s all very scary, but like I said, he is in great hands and we’re very hopeful.” Well-wishes have been pouring in ever since the accident, Mr. Labin said, noting that “his teammates, his friends, his coaches, our neighbors and our church community” have all been reaching out to the family with promises to keep Anthony in their thoughts as he begins to heal from his trauma. “We have been overwhelmed by support,” Mr. Labin said. “When something like this happens, you don’t really know what to do, so it has really meant a lot to us to know that we have so many people pulling for him.” In addition to family and friends, Mr. Labin said, Anthony even received a special message from Aaron Boone, manager of the New York Yankees, wishing him a speedy recovery and a quick return to the pitching mound. “Every kid on that team, along with all of the coaches, the parents, everybody…we’re all just hoping he comes through this okay,” Mr. Askins said. “Anthony is an amazing kid, and we all really want him to know that we’re thinking about him.” Anthony’s team decided to finish out the tournament in honor of their friend. While the team did not do too well overall, Mr. Askins said, their show of solidarity was very “genuine and moving.” When asked if friends or neighbors could do anything to help, Mr. Labin said only, “keep Anthony in your prayers. We don’t know what this is all going to look like, but knowing that so many people are thinking about him and praying for his recovery helps. It really does.” Surprisingly, Mr. Labin said, the only group that has not reached out is the one he would have expected to hear from first. “I have not heard one word from Cooperstown since Anthony was injured,” he said. “Not one word. Nothing.” © Copyright The The Westfield Leader © Copyright The The Westfield Leader'}]"
