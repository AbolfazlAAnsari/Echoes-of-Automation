County in 2023 brought controversy for administrators and a proposal that could do away with public schools’ four-day weeks and bring a longer school year. Cobre Consolidated Schools started the year with its then-superintendent on administrative leave and ends it with a new top administrator, while the president of Western New Mexico University found himself under fire after a news article examined spending on overseas travel and furnishings for the president’s house. In Silver Consolidated Schools, the board made a decision on arming school security guards and took a new approach to the academic calendar, while the superintendent sought to begin conversations on the district’s future needs. And just this month, administrators and staff from the county’s two public school districts joined educators from across the state to voice protest to a proposal by the Public Education Department that would essentially end popular four-day school weeks. Cobre sees switch in superintendents With allegations from staff that Superintendent Jeff Spaletta created a hostile work environment and a whistleblower lawsuit that alleged a former employee was targeted for discrimination, the Cobre Board of Education placed him on administrative leave for a second time this year. Spaletta had been placed on administrative leave in December 2022, but the board voted to allow him back to work at the end of January while the investigation into allegations continued. In March, the board announced that the probe, conducted by an independent investigator, found no legal or district policy violations. However, in July, the board placed him on administrative leave a second time after a new internal complaint was received. Yet another complaint was lodged in August. The exact nature of the internal complaints or who filed them was never released by the board, but a lawsuit filed by a former employee offered some insight. The lawsuit, filed in Sixth Judicial District Court in August by Teresa Holguin, the district’s former 17-year chief financial officer, alleges that she was fired in August 2022 as an act of retaliation by Spaletta and Cobre board member Gilbert Guadiana. Holguin’s lawsuit contends that the pair conspired to fire her by making false accusations of fraud and forgery after she filed a charge of discrimination against Guadiana with the New Mexico Human Rights Bureau. However, a document filed in district court on Dec. 12 by Holguin’s attorney, Ramon Soto, voluntarily dismisses the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning she cannot file the same lawsuit again. In September, the board voted to begin negotiations to sever its contract with Spaletta, and at their following meeting accepted his resignation. With Spaletta out, the board appointed interim Superintendent Michael Koury to the position through the end of the fiscal year in June. Koury, a former principal in the district, was one of several new faces on the district’s administrative team earlier in the year under Spaletta’s reorganization, part of a plan he announced in February that included non-renewal of several former administrators’ contracts. The district also hired six principals new to the district, starting the school year with a high percentage of its positions filled. Cobre was also named an Innovation Zone by the New Mexico Public Education Department, which included a $200,000 grant. Much of that money will go toward paying wages for students in jobs at schools or with community partners, intended to provide career training. The district also found itself with new funds for technology purchases after the board increased its education technology note. The increase was made to bring the district’s property taxation to 10 mills, which would allow the district to apply for a waiver in providing matching funds for the eventual construction of a new high school. That waiver has not yet been approved, but a site visit early in December by the New Mexico Public School Facilities Authority gave some encouraging signs, Koury told the board, along with a discussion of possibly building a campus combining a new high school and middle school. Five Cobre cheerleaders were selected as All American Cheerleaders by Spirit of America and got to perform in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City. Making the trip were Isabella Tovar, Leilani Marquez, Adriana Hernandez, Genessa Amador and Aaliyah Salas. Questions over WNMU president’s spending, travel WNMU President Joseph Shepard found himself answering questions in front of the New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee on Dec. 14 after an article by Searchlight New Mexico examined the university’s spending of $100,000 over five years for international travel and nearly $30,000 in Santa Fe furniture purchases for the president’s house. While at the Roundhouse for a budget presentation, Democratic District 28 state Sen. Siah Correa Hemphill, a member of the LFC, grilled Shepard about the spending. The New Mexico Higher Education Department also sent Shepard a letter asking for justification of the spending. Shepard has ordered a special audit. In the Board of Regents meeting on Dec. 7, the day after the article was published, Shepard defended the costs, saying the recruitment of international students benefited the university, the community and the students’ home countries. The president’s home, he said, is not just a residence, but is also a site for entertaining potential donors and even students. Earlier in the year, a former university employee settled a whistleblower lawsuit against the school in which the former employee alleged improper spending by Shepard. Former Vice President of Business Affairs Brenda Findley alleged Shepard directed university staff to clean his home and run personal errands and perform household duties, directed her to pay bonuses to employees he favored, allowed an associate vice president to stay in a bungalow on campus, and then fired her after she requested changes in financial reporting. Shepard said at the time that the university made the offer of the $162,500 settlement even though it believed she did not have a solid case. Findley’s attorney said his client was prepared to go to trial, but the settlement offer was reasonable. In July, the WNMU Board of Regents gave a positive evaluation of Shepard’s work and gave him a set of goals that include increasing on-campus enrollment. The university did see a 6 percent increase for fall 2023 enrollment, bolstered by an increase of about 35 percent for the freshman class. The year also saw WNMU addressing hunger on campus with the beginning steps of a new program that will have students exchanging hours of work for free produce. With a $500,000 gift from Regents Vice Chair Lyndon Haviland and her husband, the university has prepared a lot on Mississippi Avenue that will eventually house greenhouses and hoop houses for growing vegetables. Students will be required each semester to perform 45 hours of work in the gardens or with a community food security organization. WNMU became the first institution in the state to be featured on an online show, “The College Tour,” which offers video tours and profiles of students. The show’s creator, Alex Boylan, said the goal of the program is to help high school students learn about not just the school but its culture and activities students can get involved in. Five students were selected from auditions to be profiled, with the show’s crews spending a week on campus in November to film and work with the students. The show is expected to be available through thecol legetour.com, Amazon Prime Video and other platforms in the spring. In August, WNMU hosted the 10th annual International Forum for Local Sustainable Development, which focuses on aspects of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This year’s theme was social justice. In the weeklong event, visitors from UNIVA, a system of Catholic universities in Mexico, visited with faculty and staff to learn how Grant County’s municipal governments and law enforcement work toward those goals. Their visit included a tour of the WNMU Police Academy. Armed guards, calendars dominate Silver Schools’ year In June, the Silver Consolidated Schools Board of Education approved a policy years in the making that would allow armed guards in schools. While the guards have yet to be placed in the schools, Associate Superintendent Louis Alvarez updated the board in October on progress, saying guards had gone through the required psychological evaluations and their weapons and other supplies had been ordered. While the district’s surveys overwhelmingly showed support for armed guards, some questioned the need for the policy, speaking out at the board meetings in which the policy was on the agenda for first and second readings.

If the opening sentence hooks readers, chances are the story will hold up well. There are exceptions, though. Frank van der Linden in 1973 crafted one of the more interesting ledes in the long history of the Washington press corps. It also might be the worst lede ever. Van der Linden wrote: “There is a parallel between Richard Nixon’s bout with viral pneumonia and his feud with the Senate Watergate Committee. In each case the worst is over. In each case it’s apparent the president is coming out on top.” Nixon resigned from office in disgrace a year after van der Linden called game, set and match. Once Nixon departed, many people encamped within the Capital Beltway reported the National Republican Party was on life support. Republicans won three of the next four presidential elections. If nothing else, Watergate proved the public quickly forgets about scandals. Donald Trump hopes so. He did nothing for hours while watching television coverage of his supporters rioting at the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to help Trump steal the 2020 election. Trump has many other troubles. Most notably, he is under indictment, accused of running a criminal enterprise to rob Joe Biden of victory in Georgia. But polls show Trump leading by a wide margin for the Republican nomination. With the Electoral College in play for the general election, Trump could lose the national popular vote for a third time but win the presidency in 2024. Biden was the right candidate to whip Trump in 2016, when Biden didn’t run. And Biden was the correct nominee in 2020, when he unseated Trump by a decisive margin. At age 81, Biden this round doesn’t match up as well against Trump or Nikki Haley, another potential Republican nominee. Biden’s insistence on running for a second term might position Trump or Haley to flip two or three of the 10 swing states — just enough for a Republican to prevail in the Electoral College. I had hoped Biden would end his reelection bid before Christmas Day and clear the way for the candidate who could stomp Trump. I wanted Biden to recruit and endorse Michelle Obama. The former first lady would speak plainly while Trump rambled. She would be thoughtful and reasoned while Trump lavished praise on his tyrannical cornerman, Vladimir Putin. What a campaign 2024 would be with Obama setting the tone. People who seldom or never vote would participate. More states would be in play for Democrats. Trump’s personal attacks would fall flatter than his claims of election fraud. After Watergate, Republicans rebuilt their party with celebrity candidate Ronald Reagan, who won two terms as president. Reagan’s wilder claims, such as welfare queens living glorious lives, were as untruthful as Trump’s daily braggadocio. But Reagan read a teleprompter well, and he had no history of criminality. That leaves Trump especially vulnerable to Obama. She would run on honesty and competence. Trump’s résumé is full of holes, especially on those two subjects. Granted, the chances of Obama running, even if Biden wanted her to succeed him, are slender. But Democrats have a deep bench. If Biden stepped aside, two good candidates other than Obama spring to mind. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey could defeat Trump. Whitmer stood up to Trump and his pettiness in hoarding personal protective equipment during early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. She would be strong in a national election. Booker knows all about combating dirty campaigns. As a young city councilman in Newark, N.J., he ran a spirited race for mayor against a corrupt incumbent, Sharpe James. Presidential elections in the 21st century often have come down to a handful of swing states or, in the case of George W. Bush’s two victories, a single state. Al Gore would have defeated Bush if Gore had won his home state of Tennessee. Florida would not have mattered. John Kerry would have bested Bush if Kerry had won Ohio. Charisma and stage presence count as much as ever in presidential races. No one could bore an audience like Gore, and it cost him as much as any shenanigans in Florida’s recount. Trump in 2016 was gifted with a matchup against Hillary Clinton, a candidate with negatives as high as his own. Trump won every swing state that year except Virginia. Obama could stop Trump once and forever. And Biden could retire after twice having a hand in defeating Trump. That’s it — a holiday wish in need of a president who puts country first.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:03 pm Public Health Analyst Miranda Lopez, assigned to New Mexico as part of the CDC’s Overdose Response Strategy and the Office of National Drug Control Policy’s High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program, told community leaders to be on the lookout for xylazine, also known as “Tranq,” a drug that is routinely killing users across the U.S. A federal drug analyst issued a disturbing warning to local officials and harm reduction workers in Española last week: the powerful horse sedative xylazine has arrived in New Mexico and may already be circulating in the Española Valley. Public Health Analyst Miranda Lopez, assigned to New Mexico as part of the CDC’s Overdose Response Strategy and the Office of National Drug Control Policy’s High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program, told community leaders to be on the lookout for xylazine, also known as “Tranq,” a flesh-eating drug that is killing users across the U.S. “We have gotten positive cases from our state crime lab...as of two weeks ago, which was our first case,” Lopez told a crowd that included dozens of local officials and recovery experts gathered to help residents at the drug-plagued La Vista Del Rio apartments in Española. The New Mexico xylazine seizure signaled the arrival of a drug that has already been found in drug supplies in 48 states, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The sedative—approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for veterinary use and commonly administered to horses—“is starting to pop up in M-30s [fentanyl pills] in New Mexico,” Lopez said, referring to the blue pills responsible for scores of opioid overdoses across Rio Arriba County. “Xylazine, however, is not responsive to Narcan,” Lopez said at the March 23 meeting. “So in these cases, Narcan is no longer that savior for individuals who have overdosed.” Xylazine and fentanyl drug mixtures place users at a higher risk of suffering a fatal drug overdose, officials said. Because xylazine is not an opioid, naloxone, distributed under the brand name Narcan, does not reverse the drug’s effects. Still, experts recommend administering naloxone if someone might be suffering a drug overdose. People who inject drug mixtures containing xylazine also can develop severe wounds, including necrosis—the rotting of human tissue—that may lead to amputation, according to the DEA. The drug can also be snorted, swallowed or smoked. “You’re not able to see xylazine in the M-30 pills, so sometimes individuals don’t even know it’s in there,” Lopez said. “The reason xylazine is occurring in illicit drug supplies is because it allows the high of fentanyl to last longer than it usually does, which is only a couple of hours.” “We have to really...be aware of what’s popping up in the [local] supply,” Lopez told the assembled community leaders. Xylazine is a depressant and muscle relaxant that can dangerously slow breathing, heart rate and blood pressure while possibly causing skin ulcers and abscesses, experts said. The DEA issued a rare public safety alert this month warning Americans of a “sharp increase in the trafficking of fentanyl mixed with xylazine,” as well as an increase in fatal overdoses caused by the hyper-potent drug combination. The last time the DEA issued such an alert was September 2021, when DEA agents warned the public about increases in the lethality and availability of fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills. Xylazine is most commonly blended with fentanyl but has also been found in mixtures containing cocaine, heroin and a variety of other drugs, officials said. The DEA’s Laboratory System in 2022 found around 23 percent of fentanyl powder and around 7 percent of fentanyl pills seized by the agency contained xylazine, officials said. According to the CDC, 107,735 Americans died between Aug. 2021 and Aug, 2022 from drug overdoses, with 66 percent of those deaths involving synthetic opioids like fentanyl. The Sinaloa Cartel and Jalisco Cartel in Mexico, using chemicals largely sourced from China, are responsible for the vast majority of the fentanyl that is being trafficked in communities across the U.S., officials said. The cartels produce the blue M-30 pills that have devastated communities across the Española Valley, officials said. “Xylazine is making the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, fentanyl, even deadlier,” DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said earlier this month.

the Center for Public Integrity, a newsroom that investigates inequality in America. In 2018, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that the state constitution included a right to abortion, finding that “nothing could be more fundamental to the notion of liberty.” Just four years later, the court reversed itself. Iowa’s constitution does not, the justices decided, guarantee a right to abortion after all. That 2018 ruling? It had “a one-sided quality to it,” the new majority found. Iowans could no longer rely on a constitutional protection that existed just hours before. The day the ruling was issued, staff at a Planned Parenthood clinic on Des Moines’ south side were preparing to perform surgical procedures. But their work ground to a halt. Staff had to inform patients already at the clinic that they couldn’t operate, as they scrambled to understand the decision. “It's devastating,” said Jordawn Williams, the clinic manager. “It's hard to tell patients that, it's hard to see their reaction, it's hard to go through that over and over and over again.” The state constitution hadn’t changed in the four years between the state Supreme Court’s two rulings. But the justices on the bench had — and so had the role state politicians play in putting them there. One month after the ruling, Chuck Hurley, the chief counsel of influential Iowa conservative group the Family Leader, took the stage before a sold-out convention center crowd. The gathering, which was attended by Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley and then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson, was just over the Des Moines River from the Supreme Court. Hurley told the room that “Iowa is on the verge of limiting the barbaric practice of abortion” after the court’s decision. He added, “Governor Reynolds and our legislators played a huge role in that win — by changing the way we select judges in Iowa.” Iowa is not alone. In less than a decade, Republican politicians in eight states have transformed their state supreme courts — altering the process by which justices reach the bench, or the size of the court. The moves have pushed the courts to the right or solidified conservative control. The changes take different forms. North Carolina and Ohio made their judicial elections partisan contests. Arizona and Georgia expanded the number of justices. And Iowa, Idaho, Montana and Utah granted Republican governors greater control over the process of picking justices. This paved the way for rulings in Iowa and North Carolina that overturned precedents and rulings from just a few years, or months, before. But while individual rulings have attracted public scrutiny, the changes to the courts have flown under the radar. That’s despite the key role that state courts, which hear 95% of all cases in the U.S., play in American democracy. “It's hard to flip a whole state legislature. It's really expensive to win a governor's race. But it's not as hard, frankly, to turn over a state supreme court,” said Michael Kang of Northwestern University. Other Republican-led states have taken notice. In 2023, 15 legislatures considered bills to increase partisan influence in judicial selection, according to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. The shifts on state supreme courts resonate far beyond the ornate chambers where justices confer and issue rulings. State constitutions often grant rights that aren’t guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution, and state supreme court justices have the final say on what those are. Civil rights, taxes, LGBTQ+ rights, labor law, policing and more — all of it hangs on which justices take the bench. This year alone, five recently reconstituted state supreme courts have heard or are due to hear cases about abortion restrictions. What’s underway now is part of a long-term project by conservatives to transform state courts, dating back to the 1980s and efforts such as Republican strategist Karl Rove’s campaign to unseat liberals in Texas. It was supercharged by an Iowa campaign in 2010 to remove three justices who overturned a ban on same-sex marriage. That election “changed the dynamic. It opened the court up as a site for political gain,” said Rachel Paine Caufield, a professor at Drake University. “In Iowa, they've really done a good job of pinpointing specific changes that very few people would pay attention to, but will be very effective.” After the changes to the state’s nominating commission, “there's no question that the direction of the court has shifted. It's a much more conservative court,” Caufield added. That’s true nationwide, too. In 1980, just 30% of state high court justices in the U.S. were Republican, according to data compiled by Stanford researcher Brett Oliver Parker and shared with the Center for Public Integrity. (The analysis excludes justices whose party could not be determined, but keeps those who are independents.) The same data shows that by 2013, that figure crossed 50%. This year, data from the progressive legal organization Alliance for Justice shows, over 60% of state high court justices are Republican. That’s sharply out of step with the country’s political leanings. Roughly 30% of Americans told pollsters this year that they consider themselves Republican, with independents and Democrats accounting for the rest. “All the energy on this issue is on the right,” said law professor Brian Fitzpatrick of Vanderbilt University. He points to data that indicates attorneys lean left; lawyers play a key role in many states where commissions nominate judicial candidates. “It’s the Republicans that are not happy with the status quo,” he said. In the states examined by Public Integrity where there has been turnover on the bench, the courts added conservatives — or replaced Republican moderates with more right-wing justices. Politicians have come to regard courts less as a check on power than a part of the state’s governing coalition, academics and activists say. In two states, more than ideology binds judges to politicians: Ohio Supreme Court Justice Pat DeWine is the son of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, and North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Phil Berger Jr. is the son of the state’s most powerful Republican politician, state Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger. The decisions made by justices shape the lives of residents in direct, dramatic fashion. In Arizona, the high court stripped in-state tuition from more than 2,000 students in DACA, the program that protects people brought to the country as children from deportation. In Iowa, the court ruled that pretext stops by police — including those based partly on race — were legal in some circumstances, and that the justices lacked the authority to order regulation of the harmful nitrates flowing into Iowa rivers and fouling drinking water. And this spring in North Carolina, a fresh Republican majority took the highly unusual step of rehearing two politically charged cases decided the previous term. The state’s Supreme Court also overturned a lower court ruling that had restored the voting rights of tens of thousands of people with felonies. For those who registered and voted after the lower court’s ruling, the thought of losing the franchise was painful. “It's like they give us a taste, and then they snatch it back,” said Anton Sluder, 31, who lives in western North Carolina. Around the nation, the stakes are high. State supreme court justices, said Jake Faleschini of Alliance for Justice, “are the most important political actors in this country that no one's ever heard of.” States have four basic methods of selecting judges: appointment by a governor or legislature, partisan elections, non-partisan elections and nominating commissions that recommend a slate of candidates elected officials must pick from (often dubbed merit selection). The patchwork emerged out of different moments in American history. At the country’s founding, politicians appointed many judges. In the early 1800s, states adopted elections to empower independent judiciaries. In the mid-20th century, nonpartisan elections swept across the country, an attempt to sever the connection between political machines and judges. In later decades, nominating commissions became a popular method of injecting the process with transparency and legal expertise. Herbert Kritzer, an emeritus professor at the University of Minnesota, has studied states that changed their method of judicial selection. “In the roughly 20 years before 2000, the dominant motivation was more good government, legal professionalism, etc. Post-2000 it was very, very heavily policy, political,” he said. Academic research has demolished the perception that judges stand apart from politics. Legal scholars Michael Kang and Joanna Shepherd have consistently found that “judges’ voting in cases tends to favor the interests of their campaign contributors in a predictable and statistically meaningful way,” as they wrote in one paper. Their work has documented that judges favor their own parties when ruling on election cases, and that “campaign contributions from the Republican Party and its allies are associated with an increased likelihood Republican elected judges will vote in favor of their party’s interests.” Their research also found that judges who receive contributions from business groups are more likely""}]"

Image courtesy of IMDB. I will admit I did not originally want to see “The Marvels.” I have been feeling a bit of Marvel Cinematic Universe burnout with the sheer number of productions. However, some free time sent me on my merry way to see the film, and I highly recommend it. “The Marvels” might be one of my favorite releases this year, ranking leagues above “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” and “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantamania.” The movie felt like it had the humor and emotion that has been missing from recent films and it carved a path for the young Avengers in the future. While most productions leading up to “The Marvels” have been focused only on Kane the Conqueror and the issues that will lead to where we find “The Marvels” now, this movie instead focused on more of the multiverse with no mention of Kane at all. I was wary of the combination of Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani) and Captain Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris), but it proved to be rather delightful. Kamala’s youthful exuberance and naivety – as she is new to the superhero domain – paired well with Carol and Monica’s rather defeated and older hero attitudes. Kamala facing the hardships of being a hero, along with seeing Carol and Monica reunite, fulfilled the emotional character arcs I needed. The movie could have focused more on repairing the relationship between Monica and Carol, which had too easy of a happy resolution for me. However, considering the end of the movie, maybe more exploration of their relationship can happen in future projects. Another highlight of the movie is that “the villain,” Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), lacked a backstory that could have been further fleshed out so the viewers could easily understand her motive. And aren’t those the best villains – the ones you can sympathize with? She wanted to protect and restore her home, Hala, after it had been left in ruin due to Carol’s actions when getting rid of the Supreme Intelligence. Protecting one\'s home is something many can relate to. That being said, I wish the movie had explored the relationship Carol had with Hala more. The entire movie, Carol is wracked with guilt about how she handled “freeing” the Kree from the Supreme Intelligence, but we don’t see much of the fallout besides word of a civil war that rid Hala of its resources. It would have been interesting to explore more of what the Civil War was about. It is never explained. However, this is one of my favorite MCU movies from the past year. It combined a nice storyline with humor and emotion that makes it worth the watch. Definitely stay for the end credit scene. It is jaw-dropping.

New Mexico’s opioid crisis far outpaces the nation’s and has become a bigger problem over the last decade. The state has one of the worst fatal drug overdose rates in the country—which saw even higher rates during the pandemic. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has used an executive order to declare substance abuse here as a public health emergency, noting in a renewed order Dec. 12 that the state needs “immediate reinforcement and coordination” to address the crisis. Some of the help on the way comes in the form of money from settlements with opioid manufacturers and retailers. Local governments in Santa Fe say they want to throw out a life preserver by helping people with addictions who land in jail. They’re also working on programs to keep people on the right side of the law—and to keep them healthy. Former Attorney General Hector Balderas joined nationwide cases and filed individual New Mexico lawsuits that argued pharmacies and drug manufacturers failed to adequately monitor suspicious opioid prescriptions written for illegitimate purposes and, therefore, contributed to today’s growing opioid epidemic. Payments to resolve those cases are due to bring more than $1 billion to state coffers. Under the terms of the settlements, 55% of payments must be distributed to cities and counties. In Santa Fe County and the City of Santa Fe, officials are making plans about what to do next. Dollars that are moving into local control could have immediate impacts. This year’s distribution to 33 counties and 20 cities and towns amounted to $96 million, according to documents provided by Attorney General Raúl Torrez. Balderas, now the president at Northern New Mexico College in Española, tells SFR he advocated for local governments to have direct access to the cash. “I took a much more aggressive position and wanted to democratize these funds so they wouldn’t just sit at the Legislature, and we chose a 55-45% model, which empowered local governments to bypass the politics and immediately begin building out treatment programs through cities and counties. And the Legislature and the governor could reinvest the other 45%,” Balderas says. “From the very beginning, we structured the settlement so that these dollars could immediately get to providers and so that we could deliver on the ground services.” Plans are also still in development when it comes to the state’s use of the settlements. During this year’s legislative session, state lawmakers appropriated the first $21 million in settlement dollars for its programs. The state Department of Health received $3.5 million for medical-assisted treatment services—$1 million of which is specifically dedicated treatment for tribal members. The state Human Services Department will use $6.5 million to help provide housing assistance for those affected by opioid addiction; the startup and expansion of certified community behavioral health clinics and more. Finally, the state dedicated $1 million to the Corrections Department. Lauren Rodriguez, director of communications for Torrez, tells SFR $76.8 million in settlement cash also went to the State Investment Council. The state expects settlement distributions until roughly 2041 and will have decisions to make each year about how to use the money. No one from the office was available for comment before press time, she says. Balderas, however, says he’s concerned about how the state plans to use its share, adding he doesn’t believe the state “has been prepared enough [or] has done enough planning to determine what the best abatement strategies are.” “They should have been creating enough treatment provider capacity years ago. They should have created governing councils to be ready to deploy. My vision in the litigation was to ensure that, if there’s a Walgreens or a CVS distributing pain pills, there will be proportional treatment in the community, and I’m not confident that they have necessarily hit the ground running,” Balderas says. “My concern is that if they distribute these proceeds the way they distribute capital outlay, we could exacerbate the addiction crisis in New Mexico.” Santa Fe County Sheriff investigators have confiscated tens of thousands of fentanyl pills.

(Courtesy Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office) Local entities first received money from national settlements last year and the state began distributions this month from cases New Mexico fought alone. Proceeds are expected to continue over a period of 18 years, dependent on the individual settlement, as defendants including Walgreens, Albertsons, Kroger and Walmart transfer money to the state. However, Balderas says “most of the funding” is frontloaded, meaning the bulk should be received in the first few years. The settlement terms also call for the money to only be used for opioid remediation, which consists of several core strategies, including increasing access to naloxone or other FDA-approved opioid overdose reversal drugs; distribution of and education on medication-assisted treatment (MAT); funding for jails to provide treatment for inmates; and implementation of various prevention and service programs. For the Santa Fe County, putting the money into jail programs seems an obvious destination, but officials are using a grant from the US Department of Justice to plot out how that might work between now and August 2024. So far, Communications Coordinator Olivia Romo says, the county has received $865,444 and budgeted $232,502 for fiscal year 2024 to create a new position in the Public Safety Department and to provide MAT services at the jail. Local advocates say expanding MAT programs for inmates would be a significant and meaningful step. The treatment protocol—which prescribes drugs such as methadone and buprenorphine to help people with the physical aspects of dependence alongside other therapy—is already offered both at the jail and to clients at La Sala Center. The center, which the county opened in 2021 at 2052 Galisteo St., houses medically-monitored residential withdrawal treatment overseen by the Santa Fe Recovery Center. The “vast majority” of people seeking help at La Sala have a combination of substance use and mental health issues, La Sala Director Kate Field says, noting the center aims to make therapists and other services available immediately. “We’re really quite comfortable in working with any presentation of individuals that might come in,” Field says. “That really means oftentimes very acute cases, individuals that cannot access outpatient care because of functional impairment or other barriers and are not meeting criteria for inpatient care. So it’s pretty unique to have this touch point.” Santa Fe Recovery Center CEO Stacy Martin tells SFR of the roughly 5,000 people the recovery center helped this year with treatment and recovery services, about 50% are opioid addicted, and in recent years there’s been “a rapid increase” in clients using fentanyl. Those treated with MAT have the best chance of kicking the drugs, she says. “It’s the gold standard because it combines medication with counseling and behavioral health therapies, and that helps people manage their cravings, that alleviates the withdrawal symptoms that can sometimes be debilitating and helps to restore to the extent possible normal brain function which is critical for recovery,” Martin says. “That’s the most critical service that our communities need, and it’s a service that we provide and it’s one that we’re trying to expand to help meet the growing need, as evidenced from the increase of opioid deaths and increase of fentanyl use.” Martin points to statistics that have grown more dire. The US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control reports an overdose death rate of 51.6 per 100,000 people in New Mexico as of 2021, the latest year for which data is available. A decade earlier, the state’s overdose death rate was 26.3 overdose deaths per 100,000. (For comparison, the national average rate for 2021 was 32.4 deaths per 100,000. New Mexico has the fifth-worst rate.)

He graduated with a degree in journalism from the University of New Mexico in 2020 and was the editor-in-chief of UNM’s student newspaper, the Daily Lobo, for a year.

Holtec International, headquartered in Jupiter, Florida, applied in 2017 for a 40-year license to store 8,680 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel rods in 500 cannisters from power plants across the country, using a surface-level facility in a remote desert area near the border of Eddy and Lea counties. That would be the first of 20 phases of the project that could ultimately include more than 100,000 metric tons in a total of 10,000 canisters holding the waste. More: Nuke waste drum stranded at Carlsbad-area repository for 6 more months as feds find plan Should the facility be built and operational, the rods would be brought to New Mexico via rail from around the U.S., held in canisters approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which issued the license Tuesday. The NRC previously signaled the license would be provided to Holtec via an environmental review published last year finding ""minimal impacts"" from the project and recommending the license be issued. Also last year, the NRC issued a license to Interim Storage Partners for a similar facility yet to be built and augmenting the Waste Control Specialists site in Andrews, Texas. More: Nuke waste shipments travel 16 million miles to site near Carlsbad amid safety concerns NRC spokesman David McIntyre said the license was issued based on environmental and safety analysis that he said showed the facility would not harm public health. ""We issued the license because our very thorough environmental and safety reviews determined that the application met the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act and NRC regulations for protection of public health and safety,"" McIntyre said. ""We acted according to our legal authority and our long-established processes."" But lawmakers and officials for New Mexico at both the state and congressional level remained unconvinced, even as local officials in Carlsbad and Hobbs supported the project as a means of diversifying the region\'s economy. More: Carlsbad and Eddy County have differing views on possible nuke storage lawsuit New Mexico State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard, a previous opponent of the project, said as the license was issued that the area where Holtec\'s facility was sited, within the Permian Basin oil and gas shale region, would threaten the fossil fuel industry. New Mexico relies on revenue from oil and gas for about a third of its budget, billions of dollars used for public schools, hospitals and other services. The proposed site would operate near about 2,500 oil, gas and mineral wells sites and facilities, Garcia Richard argued, and 54 companies within a 10-mile radius. More: More warheads, more nuclear waste to New Mexico. Santa Fe fearful, as Carlsbad leaders support efforts She contended the State of New Mexico owns the mineral estate beneath the site, and that no oil companies agreed to restrict extraction around Holtec\'s facility and such an agreement would require approval from the State Land Office. “This is a bad idea, full stop. Placing a nuclear storage facility in the heart of oil and gas operations is a recipe for ecological disaster and unnecessarily puts New Mexicans at risk,"" Garcia Richard said. ""Bottom line, the world’s most active oil and gas producing field is not the right place for a long-term nuclear waste storage site. Holtec needs to understand that New Mexico is not the nation’s dumping ground and should stop misleading the public about the dangers their proposal presents.” More: Feds fighting nuke waste requirements called for by New Mexico at Carlsbad-area repository Lawmakers from around New Mexico largely agreed with Garcia Richard, passing a bill during this year\'s legislative session that was signed by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to bar the state from issuing permits needed by Holtec to operate the facility. The bill aimed to restrict the New Mexico Environment Department, which also publicly opposed the project, from issuing the permits for a temporary nuclear waste storage facility like Holtec\'s without the creation of a permanent repository in the U.S. Such a facility does not exist in the U.S., after a project to build one at Yucca Mountain, Nevada was blocked by lawmakers in that state and defunded by then-President Barrack Obama. More: New Mexico considers permit renewal for WIPP. Critics say its too risky Still, Holtec spokesman Patrick O\'Brien said the project had strong local support from Eddy and Lea counties, and the cities of Carlsbad and Hobbs. Those local officials formed the Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance (ELEA) which chose the location and purchased the land for the project, while recruiting Holtec and lobbying for the licensing. In exchange, ELEA and Holtec signed an agreement entitling the local consortium to a third of the revenue generated by the facility. More: More nuclear waste coming to Carlsbad-area repository as new contractor takes over “I think what a path forward looks like is still to be determined. Our invitation to join the project over 8 years ago and the strong local support in the counties of Eddy and Lea solidify our belief that the project is still viable,"" O\'Brien said. ""We will continue to work with our partners, key stakeholders, and governmental officials to help provide an interim solution to the spent fuel management impasse in the United States and help us maintain the momentum for a greener, carbon-free future.” But opposition also came from U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM), a frequent advocator of the U.S.\' transition to lower-carbon forms of energy and member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources and Energy and Water Appropriations committees. He said although the Holtec site was posited as an ""interim"" or temporary storage of the waste, Heinrich believed its lifetime could be perpetual. ""No matter how many times NRC and Holtec use the word ‘interim,’ it doesn’t make it so. And the people left to pay the consequences will be New Mexicans,” Heinrich said. “Until there is a permanent repository for our nation’s spent nuclear fuel, no regulatory commission should be using ‘interim’ standards to approve ‘indefinite’ storage. New Mexicans didn’t sign up for this.” Adrian Hedden can be reached at 575-628-5516, achedden@currentargus.com or @AdrianHedden on Twitter.'}]"

On average, a hairstyle like locs with extensions costs anywhere from $200-$900, however because the style was taken out and put back in multiple times, the price increased, according to Variety. The Albuquerque BioPark announced that their 26 year-old polar bear named Koluk passed via euthanasia on May 26. The zoo's decision to put down the large animal was due to Koluk’s rapid health decline, the park stated. In 2022, KOAT reported that seven animals at the BioPark had died in the past few years, including multiple primates that passed due to a shigella bacteria. Koluk is not the first animal to be euthanized at the zoo. One euthanization case dates back to 2010 when a Giraffe was euthanized, dismembered and tossed in a trash bin at the park. Training was a repercussion, but no one was immediately or expected to be fired, according to the Albuquerque Journal The University of New Mexico has 425 clubs — Giovanna Gong has played a prominent role in several during her time at UNM. Gong, a first generation college student, will graduate with a degree in international studies with a concentration in peacekeeping and diplomacy, as well as a minor in teaching English as a second language. She said the clubs and organizations on campus she was involved in were a highlight of her college experience, and provided her opportunities to meet new people at UNM. Albuquerque Public Schools has added 10 extra days to the academic school year. The APS Board of Education voted 5-1 in favor of the addition at their meeting on Wednesday, April 5. Before the vote, a calendar committee comprised of district, school and union staff as well as surveyed staff and parents in the community. The majority of the responses in both cases were in favor of an extended learning calendar when 29 schools extended the 2022-23 academic year, according to the APS website. The change will apply to elementary and middle schools in the district, according to the APS website. The University of New Mexico athletics department increased the football team’s budget to $50 million for the 2023-2024 year despite yet another disastrous season where they failed to beat even New Mexico State University in fall 2022. Experts believe the budget increase was a result of New Mexico State University beating the Lobos in the 2022 homecoming game after NMSU increased their training to up to two weeks a semester, according to an article written by NMSU’s Pistol Pete. This past weekend, fraternities at the University of New Mexico gathered at a summit on Johnson Field to sign a non-hazing pledge. They vowed to hold each other accountable and never again subject initiates to the cruel and unusual punishments that come with joining their organizations (wink). The men participating in the on-campus frats gathered unsupervised to conduct a meeting to write and sign the pledge; a passerby reported hearing gales of laughter from the gathering group.""}]"
