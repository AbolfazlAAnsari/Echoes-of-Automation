Nebraska's John Cook, Ally Batenhorst, Harper Murray and Bekka Allick full press conference after sweeping Pittsburgh in Final Four, Thursday, Dec. 15, 2023, in Tampa, Fla. Video courtesy of NCAA. WEST POINT, Neb. — Gwen Lindberg sits in her plush beige recliner and listens to the news. Not from the television, or the radio, but from the loud and clear voice of Gloria Wellman, sitting next to Lindberg and reading from the small-town newspaper that Lindberg devoted decades of her life to. Wellman is one of 10 volunteer readers around West Point — friends of Lindberg who take turns showing up and reading to the 89-year-old once a week. They relay updates and obituaries from the Imperial Republican, Lindberg’s hometown paper. And they read of road closures and Christmas plays and court reports from the West Point News, the weekly paper that she and her husband, Richard “Dick” Lindberg, published together for 23 years. Four years ago, the music notes on Lindberg’s piano sheet music started blurring together. It was the beginning of macular degeneration that has turned her vision into a blur of colors and shapes, with darkness in the middle. It made it impossible for her to live on her own, and impossible to read the news. When Lindberg moved into St. Joseph’s Hillside Villa in March, her daughter-in-law Jody worried: How is Mom going to read the paper? Nurses at the long-term care facility had their jobs to do. None of Lindberg’s children live in West Point, roughly 80 miles northwest of Omaha. Gwen Lindberg and her late husband were newspaper people through and through. The ink’s in her blood, her daughter-in-law said. She thought: What if we enlisted her friends? Jody Lindberg pulled together six people who volunteered to rotate turns reading to her mother-in-law. The roster has since grown to 10, with a few substitutes. “I do it because I love Gwen — who doesn’t love Gwen?” Wellman said. “I wish I could read more often, actually.” Lindberg’s life with newspapers started in Imperial, where the teenager who loved diagramming sentences in English class met the guy who worked printing the newspaper across the street from her parent’s drugstore. Every day, he’d come in and buy a Cherry Coke and a Rocky Mountain News. “And that’s how I met my husband,” Lindberg said. The couple married in 1952 and moved to Littlefield, Texas, where Dick worked as a printer for the local paper. Gwen Lindberg did a little bit of everything there. They moved back to Nebraska when Dick got a job at the Ord Quiz. The pair eventually leased and then bought the Sargent Leader in 1956 — the first time they owned a paper of their own. In 1969, they bought the West Point Republican. A few years later, they bought the competing Cuming County Democrat, merging to make the West Point News. The couple also owned papers in Scribner, Lyons, Hooper and Oakland. For 36 years, Gwen Lindberg wrote the weekly column, “Small Talk.” On the same page was her husband’s column, “Nearly News.” In the center, an editorial cartoon, often drawn by Lindberg herself. Lindberg wrote about people around town and the Girl Scout group she was den mother for. Her four sons would make it into her column, but only by nickname — the boys wanted $5 in exchange for each time their names appeared in the paper. But in a town as small as West Point, population 3,504, loyal readers could still tell which son or resident she was writing about. Occasionally, her lighthearted column would turn more serious. In 1975, Lindberg sponsored a refugee family of 10 from Vietnam. Before they arrived, she used her column to ask the readers of mostly White West Point to be welcoming to the newcomers. She once wrote a column about “coming out of the closet” as a Democrat in her largely conservative town. She didn’t worry about whether it made readers mad — God didn’t give her a worry gene, she said. In 2014, Lindberg was inducted into the Marian Andersen Nebraska Women Journalists Hall of Fame. The plaque is proudly displayed on a shelf filled with family photos. Now, Lindberg listens to the stories from the paper she and her husband sold in 1992. After 54 years living in West Point, she knows most every person and place mentioned in the pages. In Lindberg’s room, Wellman unfurls this week’s West Point News. She projects with stage presence — she and Lindberg met through West Point Community Theater, where Lindberg accompanied musicals on piano for years. The 1A story is what Lindberg calls a “good happenings” story — a newborn baby in town who received a liver transplant. It’s something amazing, she said, the kind of story that makes you feel connected to other people. It’s been 31 years since Lindberg and her husband retired from the news industry. She’s watched the paper get thinner and thinner over the years. The switch from using paper boys to mail delivery. There are more pictures on the pages, and they’re in color now. The West Point News today stays owned by Nebraskans. Enterprise Publishing, based in Blair, bought the paper, and publishes nine weeklies in Nebraska and three in Iowa. But nationally and throughout Nebraska, newspapers are disappearing. Since 2005, the U.S. has lost nearly 2,900 newspapers, according to a recent report from the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications at Northwestern University. In Nebraska, the number of journalists has nosedived from 880 in 2000 to 510 last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That loss can harm communities, she said. “It unites the community. It’s a place where their story can be told,” Lindberg said. “The more you know about another person, that’s a strong thing.” In a small town, it’s easy to keep up with all the movements, her son Mike said. The local paper is a part of that, he said. Lindberg’s room at the long-term care center can feel rootless, like she could be anywhere. But every friend that comes to read to her, every hug and chat, every article about marriages, road closures, even deaths, reminds her that she’s still here in West Point. Here in the town she brought the news to, and the town that now brings the news to her.

A state audit released Thursday alleges the short-lived startup airline Red Way violated federal regulations and squandered $3.7 million in public funds. In a news release accompanying the audit, Auditor Mike Foley called the airline experiment a debacle and described it as ""a failed riverboat gamble bankrolled by taxpayers."" Red Way started flying from the Lincoln Airport in early June, offering flights to seven destinations. The airline was the brainchild of Lincoln Airport officials and consultant Nick Wangler after the airport had trouble attracting a carrier to provide leisure service. It operated as a ""charter by the seat"" airline, meaning it was regulated as a charter service but offered scheduled flights. The flights were operated by a charter company called Global Crossing. The airline was backstopped by $3 million in American Rescue Plan Act dollars contributed by the City of Lincoln and Lancaster County to act as a revenue guarantee to cover inevitable startup losses. That money was used up in less than three months, and the audit said local governments spent an additional $700,000 on the failed airline by the time it ceased flying at the end of August. According to the audit, only one of Red Way\'s 274 flights was profitable — the inaugural flight to Orlando. Red Way\'s plan presented to the Lincoln Airport Authority projected $8.8 million in ticket sales over the first three months of operation, but actual sales came in at only a quarter of that amount. The audit said that Red Way sold only about 45% of the available seats on its flights, well below the industry average of 84%. In addition, many of the tickets sold were offered at introductory prices that were ""absolutely unsustainable."" The audit also found that both Red Way and airport personnel seemed to be confused about just how poorly the venture was doing and how badly it was hemorrhaging cash. ""For example, an email message from the Lincoln Airport Authority to a senior Lancaster County official, which was sent only 10 days before the announced demise of Red Way, stated that the Las Vegas, Nevada, and Orlando, Florida, markets \'continue to do well\' — when, in fact, those two destinations suffered the greatest losses,"" the audit report said. The audit also found that the invoices submitted to the airport by Red Way contained errors but were processed, ""in such haste and with so little attention to detail that the inaccuracies were not noticed until the auditors discovered them."" ""Had the Red Way business plan been prepared for the eyes of a reputable commercial bank lender, its proponents would not have gotten past the junior teller,"" Foley said in a statement. ""The cavalier treatment of government funds as monopoly money paved the way for the plan to be sold as a worthy risk to elected officials, who accepted it with few questions asked.” Airport officials acknowledged they made some missteps, but they also said they felt Red Way over-promised and under-delivered at numerous points during its short three months of operation. ""It was presented in a way far, far different than it played out,"" said John Olsson, chairman of the Airport Authority. One of the biggest issues, said airport Executive Director David Haring, was the amount of flying the contract required, which led to the service starting out flying to seven cities — Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, Nashville and Orlando. It was ""too big, too soon,"" he said. The scope of the flying arrangement is one of the big reasons the revenue guarantee fund was drained so fast, as less-successful destinations pulled down more-successful ones. According to the audit, the Las Vegas and Orlando routes sustained large losses but also had the most passengers and pulled in the most revenue. Given more time, Olsson and Haring said they believe those routes could have worked out. ""We didn\'t have the time to get to sustainability,"" Olsson said. After the money ran out and the airline folded, it left thousands of customers holding tickets for flights that were no longer scheduled. Though refunds were promised, they were hung up for weeks due to a dispute between the airline and the airport over how they would be paid. At the time Red Way ceased operations, more than $360,000 in refunds were owed, the audit said. Attorney General Mike Hilgers said earlier this month that final refunds for 670 customers were being processed, but Foley said his office had received email confirmations from 24 Red Way customers who had refund claims of more than $16,000 that remained unprocessed as of Monday. ""Extrapolating from that sample result, hundreds of Red Way customers may still be owed refunds amounting in aggregate to well over $100,000,"" the audit report said. The audit accuses Red Way of violating federal rules regarding escrow requirements, including falsely certifying to the bank holding its escrow account that it had made refunds from its own operating funds to secure the release of $340,000, which it then used to pay airline operating expenses rather than reimbursing customers. The auditor\'s office said it is forwarding information about the payment of refunds to the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Nebraska Attorney General for further review. Though the county\'s role was not part of the audit review, County Board Chairwoman Christa Yoakum said she appreciated that the board was provided a copy of the letter Foley sent to the Airport Authority. ""We look forward to reviewing the letter with our staff and budget and fiscal team,"" she said. Lincoln Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird declined to comment. Olsson said that while the Airport Authority learned some hard lessons, it had good intentions in trying to bring new air service to Lincoln. ""Everything was done with the best intentions of the community in mind,"" he said. Red Way began flights out of Lincoln Airport on June 8. Passengers board the Red Way inaugural flight to Orlando, Florida, at the Lincoln Airport on Thursday. The Red Way inaugural flight to Orlando takes off at the Lincoln Airport on June 8.

'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Assistant News Editor Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen signed an executive order on Aug. 30 establishing a “Women’s Bill of Rights,” which narrows the definitions of male and female. Pillen wrote that the order will expire when state law governing “participation of biological males in female athletics” takes effect. One bill that passed state legislature this year is LB574, restricting gender-affirming care for people under 19. Another bill yet to be passed is LB575, the “Sports and Spaces Act,” which would restrict access to school bathrooms and locker rooms on the basis of biological sex and would add similar restrictions to most school sports teams. The order never mentions the word “transgender,” although some say that the order has implications for transgender rights. “It\'s fair to assume, given his previous pronouncements on the matter, that this executive order was motivated by his interpretation of what\'s going on with regard to transgender athletes,” said Dr. Regina Werum, professor of sociology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Pillen said in a statement related to the order that, “It is common sense that men do not belong in women’s only spaces… as governor, it is my duty to protect our kids’ and women’s athletics, which means providing single-sex spaces for women’s sports, bathrooms and changing rooms.” Keith Mann, associate director of communications of athletics, said that the Office of the General Counsel is reviewing the governor’s executive order for any impact on the University of Nebraska system, including Nebraska Athletics. Mann said there is no additional comment from Athletics regarding the executive order. Athletics’ transgender inclusion policy is here. Cece Villa, a sophomore nutritional sciences and dietetics major, said she was heartbroken when she heard of the executive order. ""Honestly, it just hurts my heart. It really does just hurt my heart. It makes me sad that places are taking steps backwards,” Villa said. ""It\'s never going to be good when something like this happens. It\'s going to be bad for mental health. It\'s going to be a bad chain of events that are going to follow.” Villa said she thought Pillen’s beliefs may have played a role in this order. “It\'s really tough because I don\'t want to necessarily say that his beliefs are wrong, but when it hurts other people and it involves the way that people are genetically made, that is wrong,” Villa said. Villa works as a member of the Athlete Ally chapter at UNL, a chapter that Villa said started in January of this year. Athlete Ally is a nationwide, nonprofit organization working to eliminate transphobia and homophobia in sports and is working toward LGBTQ+ equality. Villa said that Athlete Ally is focused on educating the community and raising awareness of LGBTQ+ inclusion in sports. “We really are just doing our best to have our meetings and educate as many people as we can,” Villa said. “We are just trying to increase that participation and encourage that awareness and education on LGBTQ+ community in sports especially."" ""It\'s super cool because most organizations surrounding the LGBTQ+ community are just in general, like normal life, and this organization is all about working for equality in sports,” Villa said. Villa is a goalkeeper for the women’s soccer team at UNL, and said she, too, belongs to the LGBTQ+ community and stressed the importance of the communities’ inclusion in sports. “It can only help the athletes,” Villa said. “It\'s so so so important to be able to show up as 110% authentically you and not have to worry about what people think and just be able to worry about your sport and doing the best that you can.” Pillen said in the order that a person’s sex is defined by his or her biological sex assigned at birth, which Villa said she disagrees with. “Their priorities aren’t straight, and that does make me sad — they should not be worrying about this,” Villa said. “It’s not an issue, and it should not be restricting or redefining anything of the nature of what gender or sex is.” Pillen also said in the order that a female is an individual whose biological systems are designed to produce ova and a man is an individual whose biological systems are designed to fertilize that ova. ""What he does is he conflates (or combines) sex and gender and assumes that sex is also a binary issue,” Werum said. Binary means one of two options, in this case, male or female. The United Nations defines intersex as people born with sex characteristics that do not fit the male/female binary. They say that experts estimate that 1.7% of the population are born with intersex traits. “Questioning Gender”, a textbook authored by Robyn Ryle, says that intersex variations deal with both internal and external genitalia. Some examples of this in the textbook include the presence or absence of certain sex organs and individuals who have both male and female sex organs. Intersex also includes people born with extra or missing sex chromosomes. ""On one hand, you can say more than 98% of all people fit the binary. True.” Werum said. ""On the other hand 1.7%, even in a sparsely populated state like ours…30,000 people in the state of Nebraska alone who are born intersex and whom he just declared non-existent."" Keep in mind that intersex does not mean transgender, which has to do with gender identity. The Intersex Society of North America says while these groups may have similarities, they should not and cannot be thought of as one. Werum said that this executive order may have broader implications than the governor might have intended. “The issue in this proclamation is that it\'s a red herring. It\'s a distraction in and of itself. He was trying to send a signal to his political base, and that is completely within his purview as governor,” Werum said. “But an executive order is a law for as long as he\'s governor, and when this law is implemented, it will adversely affect so many more people than solely transgender athletes.” Werum said that in addition to impacting transgender athletes, that this order may impact the lives of Nebraskans who are born intersex. Research from multiple authors support that social rejection, stigma, discrimination and violence directed at transgender individuals likely increase risk for negative mental health outcomes including depression and anxiety in those communities. Additionally, hate crimes against transgender and gender non-conforming people have been on the rise in the last few years. 2021 was the deadliest year on record for hate crimes against those communities, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Additionally, the UCLA School of Law said in a 2021 press release that, “Transgender people are over four times more likely than cisgender people to experience violent victimization.” news@dailynebraskan.com Assistant News Editor Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers:'}]"

Gas stoves are estimated to be installed in at least 40 million U.S. residences. The comments from Trumka, previously a staffer for the House Oversight Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, drew immediate pushback from lawmakers. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Joe Manchin III, D-West Virginia, said in a statement that any regulation would be “a recipe for disaster.” “The federal government has no business telling American families how to cook their dinner,” said Manchin. “If this is the greatest concern that the Consumer Product Safety Commission has for American consumers, I think we need to reevaluate the commission.” House Energy and Commerce Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Washington, said it was the latest “in a long line of power grabs.” “It is not about public safety,” said Rodgers. “It is about telling the American people the federal government knows best and will decide what kind of car they can drive, how they can heat their house, and now how they’re allowed to cook food for their families.” Also on Wednesday, Republican Reps.

In October, he called for the agency to direct staff to initiate rulemaking pertaining to gas stoves, but that proposed amendment to the agency’s fiscal 2023 operating plan did not receive support from any other commissioner. He then introduced a second amendment calling for staff to issue a request for information to receive public input. Gas dangers Studies have found that gas stoves emit significant levels of nitrogen oxide, fine particulate matter and other pollution that, without proper ventilation, can raise indoor concentrations to unsafe levels. A study led by the environmental think tank RMI that was published last month in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found that gas stoves are responsible for 12.7 percent of childhood asthma cases nationwide, a similar risk to exposure to secondhand smoke. After the study was published, Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, and Rep. Donald S. Beyer Jr., D-Virginia, led a letter to Hoehn-Saric encouraging the commission to consider additional regulations, including that gas stoves be sold with range hoods that meet mandatory performance standards. The American Gas Association has pushed back against the conclusions of this study, arguing the researchers ignored relevant literature and examples of real-life appliance usage, and said the CPSC and other regulators should not rely on the data. “Attempts to generate consumer fears with baseless allegations to justify the banning of natural gas is a misguided agenda that will not improve the environment or the health of consumers and would saddle vulnerable populations with significant costs,” the AGA said in a statement. Debates over the future of gas stoves and other gas-powered appliances have raged on the state and local levels in recent years. Some liberal jurisdictions have instituted bans on new natural gas hookups as part of a wider push towards electrification in response to climate change. However, in response many Republican-led states have instituted their own laws that prohibit localities from implementing such regulations. Get local news delivered to your inbox!

CHI Health is also now the official medical partner of the sports complex located near Interstate 80 and Giles Road, according to a press release. Primary Care Medical Director Dr. Michael Schooff will represent CHI Health at the sports complex, the release said. The facility plans to offer education, support and well-being services to athletes, parents and others in the community and the region. The complex, which opened in March 2023, features 12 all-turf, lighted multipurpose fields that can support several sports. Since it opened, the facility has hosted youth and adult soccer, lacrosse, fast-pitch softball, flag football and baseball. The facility has seen 2,300 athletes and 3,500 spectators visit the facility daily at its peak, and youth soccer tournaments have brought in teams from across the region, the release said. The facility is projected to have an annual economic impact of $9.9 million, with a $401,000 impact on local sales and lodging taxes each year. It is also expected to draw more than 32,000 overnight visitors and 39,000 local visitors. Mike Cassling, the chair of the complex’s board of directors, said partnering with CHI Health will bolster the complex’s positive impact on people’s health goals and help the facility stand out among sports venues in the region. “We are honored to have the reputable name of CHI Health as the moniker on this first-class sports complex,” Cassling said. “As a leading health provider, we sincerely thank CHI Health for its investment in this facility that will inspire health and wellness in Nebraskans and visitors to our state.” Lincoln High School student Alexianna Lathan, 14, walks home from school on Monday. wearing a dinosaur onesie. “It’s pajama day,” she said, part of Lincoln High's homecoming week that culminates Friday with the Links' football game against Lincoln East at 4:30 p.m. at Seacrest Field, followed by the homecoming dance that night.

Steve Erdman of Bayard speaks at the EPIC tax ballot initiative news conference on Monday at the Capitol. State Sen. Steve Erdman of Bayard speaks at the EPIC tax ballot initiative news conference on Monday at the Capitol. State Sen. Steve Halloran of Hastings points to a single-page, printed copy of Chapter 77 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes dealing with revenue and taxation as well as related amendments on the right during a EPIC tax ballot initiative news conference on Monday at the Capitol. EPIC Option volunteer coordinator Steve Jessen speaks during a news conference on Monday at the Capitol. Organizers behind a proposed constitutional amendment that would bar Nebraska from collecting most taxes have hired a petition circulator to begin gathering signatures in the state’s most populous counties. Trailblazing Canvassers, a Florida-based firm that has qualified ballot initiatives in 18 different states, will send paid staff members into Lancaster, Douglas and Sarpy counties to ask voters to sign onto the “EPIC Option” proposal. The pair of petitions — one would eliminate property, income, inheritance and corporate taxes in Nebraska, while the second would put in place a consumption tax on all new goods and services, except groceries — have been in circulation for months. The hiring of a paid circulator marks the next stage in signature-gathering efforts, said Steve Jessen, a retired insurance agent from Norfolk who has coordinated more than 160 volunteers who have worked in rural counties of the state. Financial disclosure forms indicate EPIC Option paid Trailblazing Canvassers $20,000 in late October to begin running the petition drive. Jessen said those funds have come from small donations from people across the state frustrated by their tax bills. Other petition drives in recent years have required $1 million or more to hire paid circulators to crisscross the state. EPIC Option has raised about $89,000, according to its October report filed with the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission. The ballot initiative for EPIC, which stands for Eliminate Property, Income and Corporate, will continue to raise funds and “pay as we go,” organizers said. “This is a grassroots organization, and we’re going to get this done,” Jessen said at a news conference Monday. “We are the second house, and the second house is not happy with the way our current tax system is.” Sen. Steve Erdman of Bayard, who has introduced legislation to implement the EPIC Option at the Capitol, and who has championed the petition drive, said doing away with most taxes would make Nebraska friendlier to taxpayers and businesses, growing the state in the process. The revenue collected through the consumption tax — Erdman’s plan would set the rate at 7.5% and would apply to all new goods, including new homes — would provide the same funding to state governments, schools and local governments, proponents say. It would also get rid of a slew of tax exemptions passed by the Legislature over the past 50-plus years and would implement taxes on services from tax preparation to car repairs, home remodeling, loan processing and others items currently not taxed. It also would require nonprofits, churches, education institutions and governments to pay consumption taxes. Erdman said opponents who stand to lose tax exemptions are leading the opposition to his plan, while farmers and homeowners, who would receive actual property tax relief and not just a decrease in the amount their property taxes go up every year, are backing it. “What’s more important sometimes is who is opposed to you than who is with you,” Erdman said at a news conference Monday morning. “Those people who are against EPIC, every one of them, is a paid lobbyist or a person who is paid to be against it. “All those people who are for it are the people who are paying their taxes,” he added. But those opponents say EPIC and the consumption tax plan (LB79) put forward by Erdman would not replace the revenue needed to fund the government at its current level. An analysis by OpenSky Policy Institute in March concluded Erdman’s plan would create a $7.4 billion shortfall in state and local government revenue, and would require a consumption tax rate set at 22.1% in order to offset that. “Such a tax would fall disproportionately hard on low- and middle-income Nebraskans because a much greater portion of their wages goes to purchases that would be subject to tax,” the report concludes.

Omaha zoo trying to raise endangered sunflower sea stars The key to saving the kelp forests along the western seaboard may reside in a 5-gallon bucket at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo & Aquarium, thousands of miles from the Pacific Ocean. In that black bucket of carefully brewed water, senior aquarist Ben Morrow is trying to raise five sunflower sea stars, each about 4 millimeters in size. A sunflower sea star sits against the glass at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo & Aquarium. Named Sunny, the adult female is the fastest of the sea stars. Once grown to an adult size of 2 feet, the colorful sea stars have an important job to do. They’re often referred to as the cleanup crew of the ocean and its kelp forests, which have a crucial role of their own. They act as a nursery ground where baby fish go to elude predators. “Enough urchins and they can wipe out a kelp forest,” Morrow said. “Sea stars eat lots of snails and urchins.” Right now, there isn’t enough of the critically endangered sea stars to do the job. And that’s where Morrow and the zoo come in. “If we can figure out how to raise these species, that can contribute to putting them back into the wild,” Morrow said. “If we can figure out how to raise these species, that can contribute to putting them back into the wild,” senior aquarist Ben Morrow said.

Morrow, who had worked with sea stars before, had his first successful spawning attempt last year, settling about 200 baby sea stars. “They look like little aliens,” he said. Although only five of the 200 have survived, Morrow was able to discover that the bucket the sea stars live in in the basement of Scott Aquarium appeals more to the youngsters than specialized rearing containers. The next step is to figure out the proper nourishment they need to grow to adulthood. So far in food trials, he’s only been able to find what they like. “I haven’t found the magic treatment yet,” he said. Ben Morrow shines a flashlight into a bucket where juvenile sunflower sea stars live. He’s trying to figure out what foods will help them grow, so they can be eventually released into the wild. His goal is to figure out the nutrition question in 2024, then raise thousands for release in 2025. Friday Harbor Labs on San Juan Island near Seattle is also part of the effort. Six other aquariums will join. They’re part of an AZA SAFE Program, which focuses on saving animals from extinction.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:01 pm This column by Mona Weatherly originally appeared in the Dec. 21, 2023 issue of the Custer County Chief. You can’t hear it You can’t touch it You can’t see it now. Give us a couple of weeks and we’ll notice the difference The sun will come up a little earlier and will set a little later. We’re at the winter solstice. Dec. 21 is the first day of winter, the shortest daylight of the year for the northern hemisphere. For the longest night, the earth slumbers and is still. It’s appropriate that our thoughts turn to the night in Bethlehem so many years ago when Jesus was born. Many of us think about that night as being still and quiet, maybe a bit chilly. Current weather shows Bethlehem having nighttime temps this week in the 40s. I saw a news story a day or two ago that there are no large public celebrations of Christmas in Jerusalem and Bethlehem this year. The normally huge crowds arriving to celebrate Christmas in the Holy Land aren’t materializing. Then again, if you didn’t have to spend the holiday in a war zone, would you? There are a lot of folks across the globe spending Christmas and New Year’s at war and in war. Ukraine is looking at their second wartime Christmas. There are countries at war that may not even celebrate Christmas, so does it even matter there? It’s probably on our minds more this year because war is once again tearing at the places where Christians believe Jesus was born and grew up, where He walked and preached and where He died, rose and walked again. I’ve never been to Israel or any where in the Middle East. I’ve always wanted to go. When I was much, much younger, my mother told me that I couldn’t go to Israel until they stopped fighting there. Back then, I thought that would happen some day. I came close to going to Israel in 2001. I was in the first stages of planning when I told some friends, “I’m going to Israel.” One of them grabbed my arm and said, “You should come to Russia with us!” That was an even older and stronger dream of mine so off to Moscow and St. Petersburg I went. Israel had to wait. And with the current situation, for me, at least wait a little longer. Nazareth is north of the West Bank. Bethlehem is within it and Jerusalem, too, according to international law. I like looking at maps so I’ve been pulling maps of Israel up on the computer. There are familiar names from the Bible and maybe as you read the place names to yourself, you might find some are familiar from current news coverage. If you see a video clip of the war in Gaza, Israel and the West Bank, do you catch yourself thinking, “That’s where Jesus lived?” Do you imagine Him in the background? Do you think about Him being a baby in Bethlehem this year? Quite the thoughts for long, cold winter nights. We could discuss ad infinitum the history and politics of the Middle East. But here at home, it’s the solstice, a time of quiet, slumber and contemplation. I can say I believe Israel has the right to exist and, at the same time, say, I believe the answer is a two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine co-existing in peace. But rather than delve into the whys and what-fors, I’ll let the serenity of our peaceful and calm nights seep in and, on the beams of moonlight and starlight, raise the age-old prayer for world peace.

LINCOLN — State Sen. Tom Brewer of Gordon made one thing clear at a legislative hearing Friday about allowing more people to carry guns in schools as a way to boost security. Brewer He’s not interested in forcing teachers to carry weapons, he said. Nor is he necessarily looking to authorize anyone besides off-duty law enforcement officers to carry weapons on school grounds or at school events. State law already allows armed on-duty officers at schools. Brewer said there are a number of factors to consider before he would propose authorizing other armed people in schools. Those include figuring out what training and screening would be necessary for those people. But he told members of the Education Committee at the interim study hearing that he wants to find ways that the state can help local school districts better protect children and staff. “I think we would be very neglectful of our students if we don’t look at all the options possible,” he said. “Our laws order parents to send their kids to school. I believe that leaves us with an obligation to protect the kids while they are there.” Only invited testifiers spoke at the hearing. They offered several ideas aimed at making schools safer. The ideas included allowing trained people to carry weapons on school grounds, training school staff to treat wounded students and standardizing school maps for use by first responders. Art Frerichs, a state trooper and member of the Morrill Public School board, urged the state to look at allowing off-duty law enforcement to carry weapons on school grounds or at school events. He said the change could help districts like Morrill, which cannot afford a school resource officer and where local law enforcement could be a long way away. He said the school is well-protected with locked doors and other measures during the day, but is less so during school events. Frerichs said off-duty law enforcement could help boost security at events, but the decision should be up to local school boards. Zach Kassebaum, superintendent of Lincoln Christian School, called for going a step further by allowing “properly trained individuals that met necessary criteria” to carry guns at schools. Currently, he said, Lincoln Christian relies on unarmed volunteers to provide security, in addition to such measures as security cameras, locked entrances and double doors. Those volunteers are intended to slow down attackers so staff and students have more time to protect themselves. Kassebaum said state law ties the hands of those security volunteers by barring them from being armed. He urged a change in the law to allow people with the “right temperament and right training” to carry weapons in schools. Allowing non-law enforcement people to carry weapons can ensure rapid response to attacks, said James Donahue, community security director at the Jewish Federation of Omaha and the Friedel Jewish Academy. He said having a trained, armed person on site also can deter shooters. James Irvine, with a group called FASTER Saves Lives, argued that the responsibility for saving staff and students is the job of schools, not law enforcement. He said his group trains school staff on using weapons to stop school violence and on providing immediate medical assistance to anyone wounded. He said the medical training, in particular, saves lives because it can stop people from bleeding to death before emergency medical staff can get to the scene. The measures needed in such situations are similar to those used on the battlefield, such as tourniquets, chest seals and wound packs. “There is no denying that waiting on outside help increases fatalities,” he said. Mike Rogers, CEO of Critical Response Group, called for schools to improve and standardize their building and campus maps to help law enforcement and emergency medical personnel respond to emergencies. He said seven states have now passed legislation to require such updates. Rogers, whose company does school mapping work, said the maps often become outdated because of building renovations or changes in usage of rooms. Many do not use the common geographic orientation of having north at the top of the map. Once maps are updated, he said, they need to be made available for use by multiple agencies that use multiple computer platforms.
