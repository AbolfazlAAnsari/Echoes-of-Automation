Overall, voter turnout was low in South Carolina at 4% with 131,870 votes cast. The Upstate was no exception with around 2-3% voter turnout in most counties in the region. Low voter turnout could impact South Carolina\'s position in the primaries in 2028. Biden collected 94.6% of the vote in Greenville County, 95.4% in Spartanburg County, and 94.75% in Anderson County. When polls opened at 7 a.m., Upstate poll managers saw voters trickle in lightly and infrequently. ""I predict it to be very slow and steady because this is the presidential primary,” C.C. Woodson Community Center clerk Marilyn Parks said early Saturday morning. ""Usually in the primaries, we don\'t have many voters come out,"" Parks, a native of Spartanburg’s Southside, said. ""A lot of them have the mentality that primaries don\'t count, but what we\'re trying to instill now is that this is where it all starts ― with the primary."" Ultimately, South Carolina saw only 4% voter turnout statewide with 131,870 ballots cast, the lowest turnout in the past three Democratic presidential preference primaries. In 2020, the state saw roughly 16% voter turnout and 12.6% turnout in 2016. Former President Barack Obama, the last incumbent Democratic candidate, ran unopposed in 2012\'s state primaries. Upstate counties saw a turnout of around 2-3%. Black voters: Black voters are asked to \'show up and show out\' for Biden in South Carolina Crossing Party Lines: Fearing Biden, Trump rematch, SC Democrats weigh crossing party lines in upcoming primary Greenville County saw 2.91% voter turnout with 9,607 ballots cast, while 4,752 ballots were cast in Spartanburg County with only 2.4% voter turnout and 2,407 in Anderson with 1.99% turnout. Only one Greenville County precinct - Belle Meade in Gantt - cracked over 10% turnout of registered voters, with 161 voters casting their ballot for Biden. In 2020, 540,062 South Carolinians voted in the Democratic primary – about 16% of registered voters. Similarly, counties in the Upstate saw higher turnout in 2020 with Greenville County also seeing 16.5% voter turnout with 54,322 ballots cast, Spartanburg with 12.45% turnout with 23,613 and Anderson with 11% turnout with 13,337 ballots cast. The Upstate was the least friendly region for Biden in 2020’s primary where he saw some of the weakest results in the state. Overall, Biden won South Carolina’s primary in 2020 with 48.65% of the vote, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in second with 19.7%. But while Biden saw closer to 50% of the vote in most counties throughout the state, the president finished with less than 40% of the vote in Greenville, Oconee and Pickens counties. In contrast, Sanders saw some of his best results in the Upstate. Pickens County — the state\'s whitest and most Republican county — gave Sanders his strongest results at 27.73%. Recap: Joe Biden wins South Carolina during first official contest for Democrats Primaries Past: South Carolina presidential primary results since 2000 According to prior reporting from the Greenville News, the turnout was speculated to be in part due to ""Operation Chaos""— a counter-campaign led by some state GOP leaders to urge voters to pick Sanders over Biden to give former President Donald Trump an ""easier"" opponent to beat. With a less competitive race, Biden performed better in the Upstate this time around. In Saturday’s primary, Biden collected 94.6% of the vote in Greenville County, 95.4% in Spartanburg County, and 94.75% in Anderson County. He also finished significantly stronger in other counties in the Upstate: Statewide he collected 96% of the total vote. South Carolina’s Republican primary is up next on Feb. 24 where Nikki Haley faces an uphill battle in her home state against former President Trump. Nina Tran contributed reporting.

The Tigers avoided the regular-season sweep from the Hurricanes and are on their longest win streak since starting the season 9-0. Both teams could not build substantial leads in the first half with the lead changing and the score tying four times. Miami matched Clemson shooting from deep, each converting seven threes in the first half. The trend continued deep into the second half with both trading runs to gain a lead that would be usurped by another. It ended when Chase Hunter knocked down a corner 3-pointer to give the Tigers a 60-57 lead with 5:44 left in the game. Clemson went on a 7-0 run with contributions from Jack Clark on a fast break layup after a steal and Joseph Girard II converting three free throws that was too much for the Hurricanes to overcome. Despite Clemson allowing 12 3-pointers, its most since Jan. 16 against Georgia Tech, the Tigers overcame a desperate Miami team. Girard scored 18 points, Hunter finished with 15 points and Ian Schieffelin recorded his 11th double-digit rebound game with 10 boards. After shooting 22.8% on 3-pointers at home across five games in conference play, the Tigers have regained their deep shooting at Littlejohn Coliseum. They carried over its 17 total 3-pointers from its away games against North Carolina and Syracuse. Clemson shot 7-for-17 from three with Girard, Clark, Hunter, PJ Hall and Chauncey Wiggins each scoring from deep. The Tigers finished with 13 threes, their most at home during ACC play this season. The Tigers needed every one of them and will be imperative to keep going as they close the season with four of their remaining seven games at home Hall bounced back from a tough first half after scoring only three points and attempting one shot. Miami forward Norchad Omier plated stout defense on Hall, and the Hurricanes limited Hall’s touches in the post by sending an extra defender over before the entry pass was given to him. But like the senior did against Virginia on Feb. 3, Hall figured it out in the second half. He scored 10 points, using his size and experience to get to the free-throw line and score down low. He finished the night with 13 points — his lowest total since Jan. 20 vs. Florida State. The Tigers host NC State (15-9, 7-6) on Saturday at Littlejohn Coliseum. The Wolfpack will try to snap their two-game losing streak and come into this crucial conference matchup with a week of rest.

mulls over the future of the state’s death penalty, attorneys representing a condemned man from Spartanburg seek a reprieve after petitioning an international human rights commission for counsel. Attorneys representing Richard Moore, a man who was sentenced to death for the 1999 murder of a convenience store clerk, filed a petition to the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR) to examine whether Moore’s trial and sentence violated his human rights under international law. The IACHR promotes the protection of human rights as part of the Organization of American States (OAS), an international regional organization comprised of member states in the Americas like the United States, Mexico and Brazil. It can investigate human rights violations under international treaties established and agreed to by OAS member states, including cases involving capital punishment. Attorneys from Columbia-based nonprofit, Justice 360, petitioned the IACHR to investigate Moore’s case based on three claims: his jury selection was corrupted with racial bias, his death sentence was excessive and disproportionate, and his prosecution was tainted with racial discrimination. In July 2023, the commission issued a resolution granting ""precautionary measures,"" or a request for the state to refrain from carrying out Moore’s execution until it fully investigates the claims made. Attorneys subsequently filed a petition to the SC Supreme Court requesting Moore receive a new trial using IACHR’s resolution. The commission only grants precautionary measures in urgent cases where there is a ""risk of irreparable harm."" In April 2022, Moore received an execution notice from the state and begrudgingly elected for death by firing squad. His execution would’ve been the first carried out in South Carolina since 2011, and the first ever carried out by firing squad. But the execution was stayed while the constitutionality of the firing squad and the state’s default method, the electric chair, were challenged in court. On Feb. 6 the state Supreme Court revisited arguments on the two methods. Executions could begin again following the court’s decision. ""Should the South Carolina Supreme Court rule against the death row petitioners, Mr. Moore is the first individual up for execution,"" the attorneys wrote in their petition. What we know: Death penalty case of Spartanburg County\'s Richard Moore The Inter-American Commission of Human Rights was created in 1959 as a body of the OAS to ""promote the observance and defense of human rights"" in member countries. The commission has the power to investigate individual petitions alleging violations of human rights and make recommendations to protect them. The commission governs based on rights established in the American Declaration of Rights and Duties of Man, a declaration adopted in 1948 by member states to establish an international guiding principle to protect human rights as American laws evolve. The petition brought by Moore’s attorneys alleges his rights to equality before the law, right to a fair trial and right to due process are among those violated under the international agreement. While there is no mechanism where decisions by the IACHR can be enforced, the commission operates based on good faith among member states who agreed to the declaration. ""Treaties are the closest thing that you can get to binding law on an international level,"" Sandra Babcock, a clinical professor at Cornell Law School who specializes in human rights litigation said. ""Like all international law, there\'s no international Marshal service or sheriff\'s deputies that are going to come in and enforce this. It\'s based on respect and reciprocity."" The commission only grants precautionary measures requesting states halt executions, as it did for Moore’s case, while it investigates claims in rare and urgent situations where there is a significant risk of ""irreparable harm."" The body only steps in when domestic remedies for relief are exhausted. In 2022, the commission received 1,033 requests for precautionary measures and only 50 were granted. Of the 49 requests received from the United States, only three were granted. ""They only do it, I think in about 5% of cases maximum. When they do this, what they are recognizing is that this is a potentially meritorious argument, or in this case, a series of arguments that have been raised,"" Babcock said. ""For them to rule on the merits of these claims, it\'s important for the person not to be executed before they can finish that process."" In their petition, attorneys for Moore claimed racial bias tainted his case from the beginning and pointed to South Carolina’s history of pursuing the death penalty in a discriminatory manner. The attorneys wrote that ""no factor is more determinative of whether death will be sought in a case than the race of the victim."" Death penalty challenges that show systemic patterns of racial basis are difficult to prove in the United States. The 1987 U.S. Supreme Court case, McCleskey v. Kemp, which presented a direct challenge on whether the death penalty itself was racially biased made any future cases alleging systemic discrimination nearly impossible to fight. The Georgia case brought by Warren McCleskey, a Black man convicted of the murder of a white police officer, argued that an empirical study of over 2,000 murder cases in Georgia found race was a significant indicator for who received the death penalty. The high court rejected the claim 5 to 4. ""If we accepted McCleskey’s claim that racial bias has impermissibly tainted the capital sentencing decision, we could soon be faced with similar claims as to other types of penalty,"" former U.S. Justice Lewis Powell wrote in the decision. Cruel, unusual or corporal? SC Supreme Court revisits using firing squad, electric chair A previous investigation from the Greenville News interrogated the state’s use of capital punishment in historically racist and arbitrary ways. Of the 33 men on the state’s death row today, 16 are Black, 16 are white and one is Hispanic. Black people only make up about 26% of the state’s population. The investigation noted that in capital cases post-1976, described as the modern era of the death penalty, Black defendants make up 46.9% of those sentenced to death while white defendants make up 51.9%. However, only 16.9% of defendants have been sentenced to death for killing a Black victim, while 80.9% of defendants have been sentenced for killing a white victim. In the 2022 state Supreme Court opinion denying Moore relief, former court justice Kaye Hearn noted similar patterns in Spartanburg County where Moore was sentenced. ""From 1985-2001, there were 21 cases in Spartanburg County where a death notice was filed, and in all but one the victim was white,"" Hearn’s dissent read. Investigation: The death penalty has a racist past. In SC, evidence shows that hasn\'t changed. In their petition, attorneys detailed how Holman Gossett, the former solicitor who selected Moore’s case for capital prosecution, had a stark history of seeking the death penalty only in cases involving white victims. Gossett was the solicitor of the 7th judicial circuit, which serves Spartanburg and Cherokee counties, from 1985 until 2001. A former Cornell law professor, Theodore Eisenberg, examined Gossett’s tenure from 1985-1993 as part of a larger study on racial discrimination in the modern era of the death penalty. During that period Gossett sought death in 43% of cases eligible for capital punishment, but never in a case with a Black victim. Eisenberg noted that ""the odds of this racial pattern happening by chance were three in 5,000."" From 1993 until the end of his tenure, Gossett only sought death in one case involving a nonwhite victim. His office pursued the death penalty in the case of Theodore Kelly, a man who was convicted of killing his wife and her daughter’s fiancé in 1994. However, the sentence was vacated in part because post-conviction proceedings revealed the effort was racially motivated. Testimony from then deputy solicitor, Anthony Mabry, stated Gossett’s office only sought death in the case because they were concerned about the Black community’s reaction to disparities in death penalty cases. ""I told Holman (Solicitor Gossett) that I felt like the black community would be upset though if we did not seek the death penalty because there were two black victims in this case. . . . The only mention that was ever made of race was when I said that I felt like if we did not seek the death penalty, that the community, the black community, would be upset because we are seeking the death penalty in the (Andre) Rosemond case for the murder of two white people,"" Mabry said. Shield Law: South Carolina passes shield law in effort to resume executions. Here’s what to know. But even with Gossett’s broader pattern of bias, Moore’s case couldn’t be successfully challenged without direct evidence race played a role in his case being chosen for a death sentence. ""Without that smoking gun, without some sort of explicit evidence of intent to prosecute someone because they are a Black defendant with a white victim, no amount of statistical evidence is going to be enough,"" Madalyn Wasilczuk, assistant professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law said.'}]"

A Belvedere mother is facing a murder charge connected to the Oct. 15 death of an infant. Jordan Fowler (photo courtesy of Aiken County detention center) Jordan A. Fowler, 21, was charged Feb. 13 with murder months after her child, Charlotte Fowler, died at a Rita Court residence in North Augusta. Charlotte\'s age was 1 month and 25 days old. Fowler has been in the custody of police since Dec. 14 on a charge of legal custodian unlawful neglect of a child or helpless person. Capt. Eric Abdullah with the Aiken County Sheriff’s Office said Fowler’s new charges come from an investigation into the child\'s death. A murder warrant said Fowler struck the child in the back of the head with a stainless-steel vacuum-insulated travel mug while she was frustrated by the infant\'s constant crying. An earlier warrant said Fowler shook and squeezed the child between Aug. 20 and Oct. 15, and the child suffered multiple rib fractures and other injuries, which were identified during an autopsy as being in various stages of healing. An obituary said the child was born Aug. 20, 2023, and brought joy to everyone she encountered. Her grandfather called her a Kung Fu Master in waiting. Fowler is listed as an inmate at the Aiken County detention center and has no bond.

Congratulations, Mr. President, on a good old-fashioned whooping. See you in Michigan,"" Phillips posted on X Saturday night. Overall, voter turnout was low in South Carolina at 4% with 131,870 votes cast. The Upstate was no exception with around 2-3% voter turnout in most counties in the region. Low voter turnout could impact South Carolina\'s position in the primaries in 2028. Biden collected 94.6% of the vote in Greenville County, 95.4% in Spartanburg County, and 94.75% in Anderson County. When polls opened at 7 a.m., Upstate poll managers saw voters trickle in lightly and infrequently. ""I predict it to be very slow and steady because this is the presidential primary,” C.C. Woodson Community Center clerk Marilyn Parks said early Saturday morning. ""Usually in the primaries, we don\'t have many voters come out,"" Parks, a native of Spartanburg’s Southside, said. ""A lot of them have the mentality that primaries don\'t count, but what we\'re trying to instill now is that this is where it all starts ― with the primary."" Ultimately, South Carolina saw only 4% voter turnout statewide with 131,870 ballots cast, the lowest turnout in the past three Democratic presidential preference primaries. In 2020, the state saw roughly 16% voter turnout and 12.6% turnout in 2016. Former President Barack Obama, the last incumbent Democratic candidate, ran unopposed in 2012\'s state primaries. Upstate counties saw a turnout of around 2-3%. Black voters: Black voters are asked to \'show up and show out\' for Biden in South Carolina Crossing Party Lines: Fearing Biden, Trump rematch, SC Democrats weigh crossing party lines in upcoming primary Greenville County saw 2.91% voter turnout with 9,607 ballots cast, while 4,752 ballots were cast in Spartanburg County with only 2.4% voter turnout and 2,407 in Anderson with 1.99% turnout. Only one Greenville County precinct - Belle Meade in Gantt - cracked over 10% turnout of registered voters, with 161 voters casting their ballot for Biden. In 2020, 540,062 South Carolinians voted in the Democratic primary – about 16% of registered voters. Similarly, counties in the Upstate saw higher turnout in 2020 with Greenville County also seeing 16.5% voter turnout with 54,322 ballots cast, Spartanburg with 12.45% turnout with 23,613 and Anderson with 11% turnout with 13,337 ballots cast. The Upstate was the least friendly region for Biden in 2020’s primary where he saw some of the weakest results in the state. Overall, Biden won South Carolina’s primary in 2020 with 48.65% of the vote, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in second with 19.7%. But while Biden saw closer to 50% of the vote in most counties throughout the state, the president finished with less than 40% of the vote in Greenville, Oconee and Pickens counties. In contrast, Sanders saw some of his best results in the Upstate. Pickens County — the state\'s whitest and most Republican county — gave Sanders his strongest results at 27.73%. Recap: Joe Biden wins South Carolina during first official contest for Democrats Primaries Past: South Carolina presidential primary results since 2000 According to prior reporting from the Greenville News, the turnout was speculated to be in part due to ""Operation Chaos""— a counter-campaign led by some state GOP leaders to urge voters to pick Sanders over Biden to give former President Donald Trump an ""easier"" opponent to beat. With a less competitive race, Biden performed better in the Upstate this time around. In Saturday’s primary, Biden collected 94.6% of the vote in Greenville County, 95.4% in Spartanburg County, and 94.75% in Anderson County. He also finished significantly stronger in other counties in the Upstate: Statewide he collected 96% of the total vote. South Carolina’s Republican primary is up next on Feb. 24 where Nikki Haley faces an uphill battle in her home state against former President Trump. Nina Tran contributed reporting.

Click here to see your options for becoming a subscriber. The former home of Lexington’s oldest newspaper at 136 E. Main St. will cater to a new clientele as The Kindred Boutique. The store hopes to move into the vacant building later this year. The building formerly housed The Lexington Dispatch-News, which was founded in 1870 and would later merge with The Lexington County Chronicle. The storefront neighbors the former Lexington Jewelers locations, which now houses a health store, Deep Rooted Nutrition. It had been vacant since 2001. Boutique owners Karen Norman, Christie Connelly and Dinah Morganelli say there is a lot of work to be done, but they hope to be open by the summer. Kindred is currently located in the Old Mill, with the owners saying they are eager to move down Main Street and have more room for inventory and storage. Norman and Connelly are the faces of the boutique, while Morganelli focuses on the behind-the-scenes aspects of the store. The women’s retail store “started in August 2017 as a closet business,” said Norman. Norman and Connelly recall sitting on the floor of a walk-in closet with four other friends with their first major order and launching on Instagram. Before eventually moving into their current location, they did pop-ups around town and relied on social media livestreams to build up their business geared toward young women. Now they ship all over the country, Norman said. While their main clientele are younger women in high school, college and their 20s, they do have a little something for everyone, and they’re constantly growing their clientele. Their business has grown even through the 2020 pandemic, the owners said, explaining that while people weren’t able to shop in person, customers could pick up. “Our customers wanted to help us,” Norman said. “We’re grateful the community has allowed us to grow,” she added. “It’s turned into full-time jobs for both of us. Before we volunteered and were stay-at-home moms.” Even though Norman and Connelly were former stay-at-home moms, they had marketing degrees from college and retail experience prior to launching Kindred. Norman used to manage The Gap in Charlotte and even worked at the former Tapp’s in Columbia. Connelly recalled coordinating and playing with clothes as a child and having a love for fashion early on. In addition to buying clothes, they also enjoy getting to know the customers and playing personal stylist for people. “Our customers have become our friends,” Connelly said. “When they come in, we’ll pull items and try to help them fit their body type. We help guide them.”“People in society feel defeated but we tell them you can be pretty like you. We have a little for everyone,” Norman enthused. The store carries sizes extra-small to extra-large sizes as well as an array of shoes and accessories. The ladies explained they try and keep their prices reasonable while still carrying high quality items explaining people sometimes hear the word boutique and think items are out of their budget. While having fun with fashion is exciting for the owners and comes naturally to them, they admit technology and outsmarting the social media algorithms can be a bit tricky. “The hardest thing for us was the technology part,” said Norman. Connelly added, “The algorithms on social media and competing” in fashion can be difficult at times especially as fashion constantly changes. “We have our own niche, our own style,” Connelly added. “Our goal is to have everyone leave with a smile on their face.” The goal of their store mixes with their name, The Kindred. They were “sitting around the table and throwing our names. Because we were all friends we were kindred spirits,” Connelly said. “Most people want the same thing and that is to find joy and connection with others,” said Norman. The Kindred boutique is online at thekindredboutique.com and has accounts on Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. They are currently located at 711 E. Main St., Ste. G.

He's pictured with his wife Dawn, a native of Barnwell. The City of Barnwell hired a new chief to rebuild the Barnwell Police Department (BPD) after a tumultuous five months. Michael Butts, a career law enforcement officer, was sworn in on February 5 at the Barnwell City Council meeting. Butts will be taking the role of current interim Chief Robert Miller, who returned to BPD from retirement when former chief Lamaz Robinson departed in September 2023. Chief Miller was tasked with getting BPD back on track due to his 40 years experience with the city and department. Chief Miller was serving in an interim capacity as the city searched for a permanent hire. “This was a very difficult decision as both of these candidates were very qualified. Sometimes it just comes down to the right fit, and the council approved the candidate that they felt most fit Barnwell,” said city administrator Lynn McEwen. “We are excited about welcoming Mr. Butts as our new chief. We believe that he will bring knowledge and expertise as well as a good sense of values to the city to help us rebuild the police department.” The finalists were Butts and Christopher Carter, a U.S. Army veteran who began a career in law enforcement in 2000. Carter held positions with the Aiken Department of Public Safety, the City of Newberry Police Department, and Spartanburg Methodist College as the chief of campus safety. A committee of volunteers assisted the council in selecting the new chief after reviewing the 21 applications and interviewing the top applicants. Serving on the committee was retired Barnwell County Sheriff Ed Carroll, retired BPD deputy chief David Deering, Barnwell County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) Chief Deputy Darlene Cook, and investigator for the second circuit solicitor’s office Calvin Coach. “They were invaluable in this process, and we couldn’t have done it without their knowledge and assistance,” said McEwen of the committee. It was then up to the council to vote. Butts won the council vote five to one, with Councilmember Alicia Davis not being in favor. Butts began his law enforcement career as a corrections officer in 1996 at the McCormick Corrections Institute and Lower Savannah Pre-Release Center. In addition to being a corrections officer, Butts was also a transportation officer and an environmental safety officer. He took a position in 2001 with the Edgefield Police Department, working through the ranks for 22 years. Butts was a lieutenant in Edgefield until he was hired by the City of Barnwell in January. He thanks Edgefield Police Chief Ronnie Carter for the “great leadership and knowledge that he showed and shared with me,” he said. Although Butts began his career in law enforcement nearly three decades ago, Butts was a public servant long before that. At the age of 16, he became a volunteer firefighter and worked with the rescue squad in Aiken and Edgefield counties. Serving in this position has been a career-long dream of Butts. “I thought my chances of achieving my goal were over until this great and honorable chance with the City of Barnwell came around,” he said. “I am looking forward to this new adventure and ask the city to give the department a chance to get through the learning curve of getting to know each other, meaning me and the council, officers, and you, the great citizens of Barnwell.” In this new role, Butts’ first challenge is learning a new department, council, and citizens. “As I start my journey as a chief, I don’t take lightly but with great respect and honor. I will serve the City of Barnwell with the utmost respect and to the best of my ability,” said Butts. Butts’ first goals are to work on restructuring the department, officer retention, and bringing local and state officer training opportunities. He plans to serve under an open-door policy and lead with transparency and honesty, stating “if it is important to you, it is important to me.” Butts also plans to hold officers accountable and to high standards regarding policies and safety. “I welcome and ask for any and all questions, feedback and support from the city, citizens, and civic organizations because this is your department, and we can’t fix it if we don’t know it’s broken,” he said. Butts is not new to Barnwell. His wife of 26 years, Dawn Westmoreland Butts, is a Barnwell High School graduate and the couple still have family who live and work in the county. He hopes to soon meet more members of the community. Although he is excited to take on this new role, “I wished that my parents, father-in-law, and wife’s grandparents who treated me as their own could have been here to see and share this with us. I know that they are looking down and smiling on us and me as I take this position,” said Butts. “Chief Butts, we are glad to have you,” said Mayor Ron Still at the Feb. 5 meeting. “Chief Miller, thank you so much for everything on behalf of the City of Barnwell, for everything you have done for two careers now.” “This is a red-letter day for the City of Barnwell,” said city attorney Thomas Boulware at the meeting of Chief Butts’ swearing in.
