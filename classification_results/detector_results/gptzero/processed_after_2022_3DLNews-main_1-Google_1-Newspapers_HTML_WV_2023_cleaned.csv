MARTINSBURG — In a move aimed to tackle the issue of domestic violence, state and county law enforcement officials gathered on Monday to announce a groundbreaking new initiative. The new program, spearheaded by United States Attorney William Ihlenfeld, has already produced several indictments. Formed in January, the Berkeley County Domestic Violence Reduction Initiative is a collaboration between law enforcement agencies to protect victims of domestic violence, take dangerous criminals off the streets and enhance community safety. Law enforcement agencies are doing this by meeting regularly to share intelligence, make charging decisions together and provide support to victims. “Domestic abusers are some of the most dangerous individuals in our community,” Ilhenfeld said. “This new and innovative approach will make Berkeley County safer for everyone and especially for victims of domestic violence.” In West Virginia, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men experience domestic violence, a report by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence says. Additionally, 1 in 3 homicides in West Virginia are related to domestic violence. In 2018, domestic violence accounted for 20% of all violent crime, ranking West Virginia 16th in the nation. According to Berkeley County Prosecutor Catie Wilkes-Delligatti, the prosecutor’s office has served over 1,100 victims of domestic violence since the initiative’s start. “We want to make sure everybody knows we are dedicated to a victim-centric approach,” Delligatti said. Berkeley County’s initiative is the first of its kind in the state, having been chosen due to the strong pre-existing relationships between its law enforcement agencies and its proximity to other states, allowing the initiative to deal with interstate domestic violence issues, like the crossing of state lines to violate protective orders. In May, the grand jury returned multiple indictments made possible by this initiative, including: • Paul Richard Tomlinson, 23, of Martinsburg, was indicted on firearms, witness tampering and interstate violations. He was arrested for trying to violate a protective order put on him by a Berkeley County resident. • Brian Michael Lewis, 42, of Levels, West Virginia, was been charged with two firearms charges. Lewis had previous convictions that prohibit the possession of firearms and was arrested on a domestic violence call. • Gabriel Ian Smith, 45, of Falling Waters, was charged with a firearms violation. Smith was prohibited from possessing a firearm because of previous domestic battery convictions. • Justin Scott Shaw, 34, of Martinsburg, was indicted on a firearms charge for owning a gun despite previous domestic battery charges that prohibited him from doing so. The cases were prosecuted by Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Ward, along with the Jefferson County Prosecutor’s Office, on behalf of the government. In Berkeley County, the agencies involved in the initiative include the Berkeley County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office, Berkeley County Sheriff’s Department, Martinsburg Police Department, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Eastern Panhandle Empowerment Center. “It will be game-changing in how these cases are prosecuted,” said Martinsburg Police Chief George Swartwood. “It’s another tool for defeating domestic violence.” While a path toward eradicating domestic violence is undoubtedly challenging, the launch of the Berkeley County Domestic Violence Reduction Initiative marks a pivotal moment in the fight against this pervasive issue.
