Joe Manchin announced Friday he has left the Democratic Party and registered as an independent. by JEFF MORRIS TOPICS: PUTNAM COUNTY, W.Va. (WCHS) — Putnam County’s sheriff says he has been inundated with calls about people in the county being scammed over the phone and on the internet with several people losing thousands of dollars. “One individual lost $9,000, and I know somebody else who lost $10,000,” Sheriff Bobby Eggleton said in a Facebook video posted Wednesday on the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page. Video of the sheriff's message can be viewed below or click here if you are on a mobile device. Eggleton said older residents are being targeted. The sheriff said everyone should take heed to the old adage that if sounds too good to be true, it probably is. “I just want to come on here and tell you, do not – please do not – give people money like that over the phone. Don’t send them anything like cards. Don’t send them anything like that,” Eggleton said. The sheriff asked anyone who has questions or concerns about possible scams in the county to contact him, but he noted that is nearly impossible to get money back once people have been victimized. Eggleton said the sheriff’s office detectives can look into situations and the sheriff’s office can contact the FBI, but “nobody is going to get your money back.” “These people most of the time are working out of the country. They will wear you out. They will call you on the phone. They will ask you for money. They will do everything in the world to try and get your money. Once they get your money and your information, they just run rampant with it. They’ll borrow money against you,” he said. Eggleton said residents of the county work hard for their money, and he wants them to keep it. “There are a bunch of crooks out there taking advantage of our people in Putnam County and we’re falling for it. We’ve got to stop that,” he said.""}]"
