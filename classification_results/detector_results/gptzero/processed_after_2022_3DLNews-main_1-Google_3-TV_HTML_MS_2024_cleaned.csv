(KPHO/Gray News) – A university in Arizona is offering a course that will allow students to help police departments solve cold cases. Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott is launching a course to help detectives solve long-unsolved cases this fall. Dr. Diana Orem, the forensics psychology chair at Embry Riddle, is creating the capstone cold case course. Orem said many cold cases go unsolved simply because of a lack of staffing and resources. The hope is students can be additional eyes on old cases. “Everyone watches the [true crime] shows, and everybody knows ‘Cold Case Files’ and all the podcasts, so there’s no shortage of students who want to take this course,” Orem said. A former crime scene investigator with the Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office will teach the class. The course already has cold cases lined up to investigate. Embry Riddle plans to enroll five senior students in the first course this fall. But students will be working with highly confidential evidence and new technology, so there will be strict rules in the class. “They have to work in one room with laptops that they can’t take anywhere, and they’re not allowed to have their phones,” Orem said. Orem said she also is planning to use drones for investigations and virtual reality to recreate crime scenes that no longer exist, “which makes it much more likely that the people that are working on the cold case investigation can walk through it in their minds, and maybe see something or get a better understanding of how it played out, and it could help them solve the case.” Cases that are not solved within the semester won’t go back on the shelf. Instead, they will be passed onto the next semester’s students with a fresh set of eyes. Orem said she is hoping to work with agencies all over Arizona, including tribal police.
