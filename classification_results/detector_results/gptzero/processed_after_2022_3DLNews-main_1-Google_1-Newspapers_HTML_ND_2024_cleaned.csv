According to the National Weather Service in Grand Forks , temperatures in Grand Forks have been averaging almost seven degrees above normal since the beginning of October. The warmer temperatures mean more of a chance of mixed precipitation and potential for ice events, like the ice storm that hit at the end of December. Grand Forks also has seen less snow than last winter. Unlike last winter, which had seen almost 31 inches of snowfall by this time , Grand Forks has only seen 13 inches of snow since Oct. 1. “Compared to last winter, it’s a big change, because it seemed like we were always moving snow every day,” Grand Forks Public Works Operations Director Sharon Lipsch said. “This winter, we’re finding ourselves salting and sanding more because of the frost in the morning with the warmer temperatures.” Already this winter Grand Forks has sprayed more gallons of liquid anti-icing than it did all of last winter. Also, the city has used 2,050 cubic yards of sand so far this winter; in the last five years, the city has used an average of 2,230 cubic yards of sand for the entire winter. ADVERTISEMENT Even though the city is having to treat the roads for ice more, less snow generally means equipment repairs and fuel costs are down. The milder weather has also given public works staff time to complete other projects. “We’ve actually been fairly busy with other projects,” East Grand Forks Public Works Director Jason Stordahl said. “Cleaning and organizing the workshop, doing some remodels like painting rooms and we had more time for our Christmas tree pickup.” Warmer temperatures mean the weather is cloudier and foggier. It also increases the chances of mixed precipitation and the potential for freezing rain, drizzle and fog. The main culprit is the ongoing El Niño in the Pacific and the jetstream keeping much of the polar air well to the north. Grand Forks broke several daily records last month for warm temperatures. Already in February, Grand Forks has broken five daily records for the warmest daily recorded low temperatures. With roughly a month until the spring equinox, the darkest and traditionally coldest days of winter are past. The National Weather Service is predicting temperatures will remain above normal throughout February. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT'}]"

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 7:43 pm Hillsboro Elementary School Principal Jon Dryburgh verbally accepted an offer to become the Hillsboro School District’s next superintendent on Wednesday night. Hillsboro Elementary School Principal Jon Dryburgh has accepted a verbal offer to replace Paula Suda as superintendent of Hillsboro Public Schools starting in July. The Hillsboro School Board wrapped up its third and final interview Wednesday with a trio of candidates who applied to become Hillsboro’s next superintendent. Following a 45-minute discussion about the merits of each finalist, board members voted to extend a contract offer to Dryburgh and ask him to take over as the school district’s top administrator. School Board President Tim Kozojed said Dryburgh, who has served as principal at Hillsboro Elementary School since 2013, demonstrated the leadership and focus that made him the board’s top choice to replace Suda, who plans to retire in June. “Jon understands the current state of the school and he’ll have the ability to put his leadership spin on things and figure out, with help from the board, where to take our school in the future,” Kozojed said. Kozojed praised Dryburgh for being a great communicator and someone whose life experiences would allow him to bring a wealth of knowledge to the position as a first-time superintendent.

The Securities and Exchange Commission took over the assets in December, and a complaint against the company said Agridime diverted tens of millions of dollars in investor funds to make Ponzi scheme payments to prior investors. The complaint says Agridime owes $191 million to investors in 15 states. About $40 million, or more than 20%, is owed to North Dakota investors, the North Dakota Securities Department said. So if it sounded too good to be true, how did so many investors get hooked? ADVERTISEMENT In North Dakota, it can be attributed in part to Agridime using a trusted cattle broker as a sales agent. Taylor Bang of Killdeer had worked with ranchers in North Dakota for years before getting involved with Agridime. “One hundred percent up and up,” Killdeer beef producer Tom Murphy said of his 20 years of doing business with Bang. Agridime was incorporated in Texas in 2017. Murphy said he was skeptical of Agridime at first, but neighbors who had invested said Agridime was holding up its end of the deal. Here was the deal: Invest $2,000 with Agridime, and in 12 months, get a 15% to 20% return. With a $100,000 investment, a 20% profit was guaranteed. Murphy got pulled in, and after his first contract paid off as promised, he reinvested. But his third contract is due to pay off in May. “That one isn’t looking so good,” he said. Murphy said he has benefited from North Dakota’s revitalized oil industry, giving him money to invest that would not have available before. He said other western North Dakota landowners are in the same situation. ADVERTISEMENT Murphy and North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring both noted that cattle markets have been on the upswing, making the idea of larger-than-usual profit margins seem attainable. But Murphy admits that the Agridime profit margins seemed high. “There’s never been 30% profit margin in the history of the cattle market, ever,” he said. And then there was the Agridime business model. Agridime worked with feedlots in several states to bring cattle up to market weight but said it had its own meat packing plants in Kansas, Texas and Arizona. It also had its own distribution system and was marketing its meat as a premium product. By eliminating some of the steps in getting beef to market — cutting out the middleman — the company told Murphy it could achieve those profits. “They said they had their own packing facilities and were marketing directly over the internet,” Murphy said. “And they said that’s how come there was such a profit margin.” ADVERTISEMENT Farmers “do feel like the middleman is getting too much, and quite frankly, I get where that mentality comes from,” said Goehring, who is also a beef producer. “So it’s easy to get lulled into the ‘I’m getting screwed,’” way of thinking, Goehring said. Consolidation in the industry has left just four large meatpacking companies. Producers complain that the lack of competition hurts producers and benefits the packers. “The packers make as much money on that calf in 14 days as we do in a year,” Murphy said. Murphy said he still believes the Agridime model could have succeeded. “I don’t think it started off as a Ponzi scheme,” Murphy said. “I think it started off as a business they probably could have pulled off.” This story was originally published on NorthDakotaMonitor.com ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

Not because he commanded attention — just the opposite. You almost sense he didn’t want to be the center of attention, despite an impressive career in state and local government and education. But it was hard not to notice him. He was tall, handsome and dignified. More importantly, he was kind, warm and genuine. It didn’t matter if he was speaking to a university president or the teenager at church bringing him a cup of coffee — everyone was important to Clyde. But no one was more important to Clyde Allen than the person he called “his best friend,” son Scott Allen. Recently, the two men died in the same room, 13 days apart. A nearly 60-year bond — built through father/son fishing trips, movie nights and just hanging out — will conclude with a joint funeral service on Friday, Feb. 16. Clyde was a native of Massachusetts who met the love of his life, Esther, in a dance class in Washington, D.C. Following their marriage, they moved to the Twin Cities, where they welcomed two children into the family. Daughter Cindy came first. She was nearly 5 years old when baby brother Scott was born. ADVERTISEMENT “He was always happy. He always had the biggest smile,” said Cindy Rogness, who now lives in Duluth. But Rogness said early in childhood they started noticing some issues with Scott. “There wasn’t really a set diagnosis. There were just so many things,” Rogness said. “In school, he had learning disabilities. He was hyperactive. And at that point, the autism spectrum really wasn’t much of a thing. I think looking back, he would have been deemed Asperger’s.” During this time, Clyde was making a name for himself in the Twin Cities both in the private and public sectors. He worked for Honeywell, the Minnesota Taxpayers Association and served on the Bloomington City Council. He eventually became the state commissioner of revenue under Gov. Al Quie. But Rogness said her parents also took the time to make sure Scott was involved and included, like any other kid. But after 25 years, a new opportunity arose in Moorhead. Clyde was hired at Concordia College to work as vice president of financial affairs and the business office. Former Concordia College president and friend Paul Dovre said Allen worked with “effectiveness and integrity” and he made everyone around him better. “He was an exemplar as a man of service, as a man of loyalty, as a man of great and good gifts which he’s shared so generously with his family and his community, with the college. Anything he committed to, he was all in,” Dovre said. ADVERTISEMENT Esther was also making a name for herself on campus and around town. Scott was also a frequent visitor to campus. “Scott was just a part of everything he (Clyde) did. He’d come to committee meetings and they’d go to sporting events,” Rogness said. “When a new movie came out that Scott wanted to see, they’d go to the midnight showing together because Scott wanted to go to the first show.” Dovre said he heard some of the best stories about Scott and Clyde’s time together when Clyde served on the prestigious University of Minnesota Board of Regents. “They referred to him sometimes as 'The 13th Regent,’ ” Dovre said with a laugh. “He would come to meetings waiting for his dad, but in the process, he got acquainted with the board members, with the president, and the vice president. He wasn't at all self-conscious about introducing himself to people that he didn’t know or people that were of high rank. He’d go to the occasional football game and be invited to sit in the president’s box.” In fact, Scott had the confidence to hobnob with North Dakota legislators. In 2005, he saw something that needed to be changed. Scott, who had a non-driver North Dakota photo identification, realized that, because of a glitch in the system, he could not have the “organ donor” designation on his card. According to his obituary, “Scott eventually got to testify in the North Dakota Senate and helped pass the legislation that changed that ruling. Scott received the very first non-driver photo ID card with a designation for being an ‘organ donor ’ following the change in ruling.” ADVERTISEMENT However, it wasn’t all serious business for the Allens. Forum columnist Jim Shaw said Clyde, Esther and Scott attended the Patriots’ Day gatherings he and Clyde cooked up a few years ago. Shaw said it was probably about 30 years ago when he and Clyde met and realized they had grown up just a few miles from each other in the suburbs of Boston. One thing led to another, and the two men discussed Patriots’ Day, a huge holiday in Massachusetts celebrated every year in April to honor some of the first battles of the Revolutionary War. “But we’re out here and it’s just another day and there’s nobody to celebrate or even talk about (it) with!” Shaw said. So the two men started calling each other every year on Patriots’ Day to mark it together. “He wouldn’t even say 'Hello.’ I would just pick up the phone and he’d say, 'Listen, my children and you shall hear of the midnight ride of Paul Revere on the 18th of April in 75’ and he would go on and on and he would read the whole poem and it was so cool,” Shaw said with a hearty laugh. The phone calls eventually turned into Patriots’ Day parties and, following Scott’s lead, Shaw and Clyde lobbied the North Dakota Legislature to make Patriots’ Day a holiday. ADVERTISEMENT “This Patriots’ Day just won’t be the same without him around anymore. I’ll just have an empty feeling without him,” Shaw said. “He was such a great guy. So warm and friendly. But that was our day and I’m going to miss him.” Life slowed down a bit for the Allens when Esther was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2013. Clyde became her caregiver, until her death on Dec. 18, 2022. Both Clyde and Scott were surrounded by friends, but after 65 years of marriage, losing Esther was difficult. “He was a brave face, but he was lonesome for her. He always said to me, the hardest time was going to bed at night,” Rogness said. By this point, Scott was suffering from some physical ailments and was living at The Meadows on University, a skilled nursing facility. Scott and Clyde still talked on the phone a couple times a day, every day. Clyde’s health started to fail in his last few months, so the family started looking for a nursing home with hospice care. Right away, they thought about reuniting Scott and Clyde by moving Clyde into The Meadows. Scott’s roommate had just moved out, prompting Scott to suggest they share a room. “He was so excited to have Dad there with him,” Rogness said. ADVERTISEMENT That was on a Monday. By Tuesday, after spending the day together, her brother started to notice that his dad was different, Rogness said. “At that point, I think the reality started to sink in for Scott and he realized Dad’s going to die,” she said. That Tuesday afternoon, Scott’s oxygen levels started to drop and he was taken to the emergency room. The family knew he wouldn’t live long. They had the option of sending Scott to the hospital or bringing him back to the nursing home to be with his dad. The family decided that Scott would rather be with his dad, so they moved him back to the nursing home to be next to Clyde. “My dad couldn’t get out of bed. But the staff at The Meadows was absolutely wonderful. They rolled the bed right over next to dad’s and dad could reach over and hold his hand. For a couple of hours, my dad just got to hold his hand and laugh about memories,” Rogness said. “I really feel that Scott just decided he didn't want to live without his best friend. So he let go.” Scott Allen died the next day, Wednesday, Jan. 24, 2024, at the age of 59. Rogness said she asked her father, who was in hospice care, what he thought about having a combined funeral with Scott when he died. “My dad’s comment was, 'Oh, I wouldn’t want to take anything away from Scott’s service,’ ” Rogness recalled. “He was thinking about Scott and how he was going to be honored and not about himself.” Just 13 days later, Clyde Allen died on Tuesday, Feb. 6, 2024, at the age of 88. Rogness and the rest of the family started planning the joint service. ADVERTISEMENT Rogness has now lost all three members of her family of origin in just 14 months.

planned a mass shooting in downtown Fargo loaded his vehicle with guns and explosives before he opened fire on police. Recently released images, videos and documents give more insight into how Mohamad Barakat, of Fargo, prepared for a deadly shooting on July 14, 2023. Before the 37-year-old got a chance to attack attendees of the Downtown Fargo Street Fair, as police believe he intended to do, he shot officers Jake Wallin, Andrew Dotas and Tyler Hawes while they responded to a routine crash at 25th Street and Ninth Avenue South. Barakat killed Wallin and seriously injured Hawes and Dotas, as well as bystander Karlee Koswick. Officer Zach Robinson, who also was at the crash scene when Barakat opened fire, killed the gunman and ended the threat. The North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation announced Monday, Jan. 22, it had finished its probe into the shooting. North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said Thursday that investigators could not determine a motive. ADVERTISEMENT “No one commits an act like this if they aren’t teeming with hatred, just filled with hatred,” he said He noted there was no evidence that Barakat was motivated by politics or religion. On Thursday, The Forum obtained through an open records request documents, videos, interviews and hundreds of photos used in the investigation. Possibly the most telling images are those taken with Barakat’s own surveillance camera in his apartment at Bluemont Village Apartments in the 2800 block of 23rd Avenue South. Those images show how Barakat prepared himself in the hours leading up to the shooting. The first photo shows a tactical vest on the floor of his apartment at about 8 p.m. July 13. He wore that vest as he fired at officers. The next images show him walking to his bedroom to assemble a short-barreled shotgun. Shortly after midnight, he is seen holding a Quran. The next photos come after 9:30 a.m. on July 14 and show Barakat holding an AK-47, then a short-barreled rifle. At 9:36 a.m., he grabs a suitcase. ADVERTISEMENT He then tries to put on the tactical vest at 10:09 a.m. At 10:13 a.m., he appears to load his suitcase with weapons. The suitcase was found in the car after the shooting, according to photos from the BCI. He then leaves the apartment with a rifle case, the suitcase he just loaded and another bag. Before leaving the apartment building, he secures his unit’s door with a strap. Video then shows him loading guns in the garage, getting into his vehicle and driving to the Cass County Wildlife Club. Barakat visited that gun range in the past. Body camera footage showed a May 5 interaction between Barakat and a Cass County Sheriff’s deputy at the gun range. Deputies responded to reports that he shot at Tannerite, an exploding target that is prohibited at the range. Law enforcement also found Tannerite in Barakat’s vehicle after the July 14 shooting. The images disclosed by the BCI show Barakat arriving at the Wildlife Club at 10:48 a.m. and carrying a rifle to the range. Photos don’t show him using the range, but he left at about 11:09 a.m. Barakat stopped at the Tesoro gas station in Casselton to buy gas and cigarettes. He also went into the Dollar General in the city, where he bought a bottle of soda, according to the documents. He then returned to his apartment garage in Fargo shortly before noon, checked on the cable that secured his apartment door and left again. Surveillance cameras show Barakat driving away and returning to his apartment or garage several times during the day. At 1:45, he is seen loading gas cans from his garage into his car. ADVERTISEMENT A photo taken inside his apartment building shows him arguing with property management around 2:30 p.m. Ten minutes later, the crash where he would shoot law enforcement happens at 25th Street and Ninth Avenue South. Wrigley said Barakat couldn’t have known the crash occurred, noting he did not have a traffic scanner. Barakat left his apartment complex at 2:46 p.m., about four minutes after the crash. He then drove north on 25th Street toward the crash. He circled the scene several times before parking in a lot near the crash. At 3:04 p.m., Barakat started shooting at officers. The gunfire lasted roughly two minutes before Robinson shot and killed Barakat. The Forum will continue to look through the BCI files to find out more information about Barakat and the shooting.
