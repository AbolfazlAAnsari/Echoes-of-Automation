Cherika Hardrick is holding on to every moment that she has with her mom a little tighter these days after almost losing her to COVID-19. “She’s still my mom but then, it’s like she’s not my mom if that makes sense,” explained Hardrick. Her mom, Lynette Moore, was recently released from the hospital after moving around to different facilities over the past nine months. Lynette entered a hospital last spring with flu-like symptoms, but she didn’t go alone. Her husband of almost 20 years and Cherika’s step-father was also admitted with flu-like symptoms. Unfortunately, he didn’t survive to leave the hospital. And Moore, to this day, isn’t fully aware of her husband’s passing. “Does she ask for him at all?” WALB News 10′s Bobby Poitevint asked. “No,” replied Hardrick “She knows that something has happened, she’s just really not there?” asked Bobby. “Yeah,” said Hardrick. Moore, who is from Cuthbert, is in physical and occupational therapy now as she continues her road to recovery. Doctors told Hardrick that her mom has the potential to make a full recovery if she just has the willpower and if they can find the source of why she’s just not energetic. “The hardest part of the day is like getting her up and getting her into a routine,” explained Hardrick. But Hardrick’s strength doesn’t come without its challenges. “I don’t allow her to see me cry. I have to be strong for her,” Hardrick told WALB.
