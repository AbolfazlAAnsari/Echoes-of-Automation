passenger airplane in and out of the Las Cruces airport for the first time in nearly two decades. Advanced Airlines, more commonly referred to as Advanced Air, will offer passenger air service from Las Cruces International Airport starting in January 2023, the city stated in a news release. In a Facebook post, the airport reported Monday, Jan. 16 as the date service will start. The city recently finalized a two-year contract with Advanced Air to provide seven weekly flights between Las Cruces and Albuquerque — two flights on Mondays and Fridays and one flight on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. According to the city, Advanced Air primarily utilizes the Beechcraft Super King Air 350. The twin-engine aircraft has a capacity of nine passengers. “Passenger air service has been missing from Las Cruces for nearly 20 years,” said Andy Hume, Administrator of the Las Cruces International Airport. “This new service will help business travelers and opens travel options to connecting flights out of Albuquerque. The airport would like to explore the possibility of adding passenger air service to Santa Fe, Dallas-Fort Worth and Phoenix, the city stated in the news release. “We’re excited about the possibilities and that this new venture will focus more attention on the airport, the growth potential we have and especially with the Las Cruces Innovation and Industrial Park,"" Hume said. The Las Cruces International Airport last had passenger air service in 2005 with Mesa Airlines. Between the late 1940s and 2005, 11 airlines provided commercial passenger service there. Advanced Air, based in Hawthorne, Calif., is already in some New Mexico airports, including providing service between Silver City and Albuquerque, between Silver City and Phoenix, and between Gallup and Phoenix. The two-year contract includes $1,750,000 in funding each year from the Rural Air Service Enhancement grant through the New Mexico Department of Transportation, the city stated in a news release. The contract requires the city to provide $175,000 annually during the two-year contract. The city has been working for the past year to secure an passenger air service vendor. A year ago, Hume told the Sun-News the hour-long plane rides to and from Las Cruces and Albuquerque — about 225 miles apart by interstate — would likely be the first established and would be an ""easy win,"" since he said there are a plethora of companies that do business in New Mexico\'s two largest cities. Hume said an estimated 18,000 trips a year occur between the two cities by any mode of transportation. With intrastate air service, he said the airport expects to pick up a portion of that existing demand. Currently, most Las Cruces-area residents travel to El Paso, Texas, for passenger air service.

Even those with the best of intentions could easily become seduced by power that would infringe upon our God-given rights. That is one reason they wanted to limit the power of the federal government. It is that very government that today is proving them right. Amos Miller is an Amish farmer in Pennsylvania. He first came to my attention a few years ago because the USDA was trying to shut down his farm. Amos follows his religious tenets by eschewing modern farming methods, including chemicals and pesticides. He decided several years ago to form a 'club'. The members could buy his beef, pork, chicken, and vegetables, which he ships all over the country. The club currently has 4000 members, all of whom sign a statement recognizing that he is not using chemicals, GMOs, and that he processes all meat in a facility that is not approved by the USDA. That is what they want, and they pay a premium to get it. The USDA has tried to shut him down or force him to follow their rules. One of those rules requires all meat to be treated with a chemical solution consisting of citric acid, lactic acid and peracetic acid. The citric acid is not orange or lemon based but is derived from highly processed corn. The lactic acid is created in a lab and the peracetic acid is widely believed to have serious health consequences. This goes against Amos' religious beliefs and his customers don't like processed or chemically treated foods. The USDA filed suit against Amos to force him to stop. Every 2 months, agents visit his farm to ensure he complies with a court order not to sell any meat. They literally tag and count every cow, pig, and chicken. The judge has ordered Amos to pay $250,000 in fines for contempt of court because he has killed some animals to feed his family. He also ordered Amos to pay the cost of the USDA agents monitoring trips, another $50,000. He doesn't have that kind of money. Neither does he have the money to get a USDA certification. That can cost close to $100,000. The judge has also denied Amos' request to represent himself as he has lost faith in his court-appointed attorney. The fines for violating USDA rules have yet to calculated but will certainly run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. To be fair, some health regulations on meat processors make sense and are necessary, especially for large processing plants. But Amos butchers one cow and one pig per week along with six chickens. No one has gotten sick from his products. But this isn't about ensuring the health of the public. This is about control and the bureaucrats' belief that the general public can't make informed decisions on their own. They think we are stupid. Given the quality of education our kids have received in government schools for the last three decades, there is probably some validity to that argument. But control is what the feds are seeking. As I said during the pandemic, it is much easier for government officials at all levels to control large regional or national companies. If they want to implement restrictions or rules, they only have to go to Walmart, Target, Coca-Cola, Ford, Applebee's, and a few other large companies and tell them what to do. They don't want to have to go to the half million small farmers, ranchers or business people and try to control them. That task would not only be monumental but impossible. Control of every aspect of our life is what the government seeks. They know they don't have to live by the rules they impose upon us. They also know they can live a lifestyle that they deny us. They can fly around in private jets, have summer homes around the world, and siphon money from donors or those wishing to do business with the government, lining their own pockets with the cash. They know when health care, food, housing, and other basic needs are rationed they will not be subject to the limitations. I doubt Gavin Newsom even owns an electric vehicle but if he does, he likely can charge it anytime he desires. And don't get me started on Joe Biden or Nancy Pelosi or Michelle Lujan Grisham. Things will only get worse if we do not begin the process of taking our country back this November. Not only do we need to turn out in numbers that cannot be overcome by stuffing the ballot box, but we must elect officials that will be accountable to us and then after six years vote someone else in. No matter how good we think the politician we elected is, even if they perform admirably, they are still human. And while they're in office, we must expect them to do the job that Donald Trump started, drain the swamp.

Michelle Lujan Grisham speaks in front of the future Española police station north of Walmart on Riverside Drive. Also pictured: Police Chief Mizel Garcia. Española Police Department is moving to a new police station on Riverside Drive from its current location on Industrial Park Road. City officials said they hope to have the department settled into the new station by Jan. 1, 2023. The building — at 1710 N. Riverside Dr. — was formerly occupied by the United States Forest Service. Mayor John Ramon Vigil said it will be the first time in the city’s 97-year history that a city administrative office will be relocated outside of the area of Española’s historic district. Vigil and Española Police Chief Mizel Garcia cited the large percentage of emergency calls in the area as a primary factor in deciding to move police operations there. Garcia said around 30 percent of calls come from the area. “All the records reflect that this is where we need a Police Department for our community,” Vigil said. Garcia called the area of Riverside Drive the “hub of a lot of our calls for service in the city of Española.” The new building, Garcia said, will be 1,000 square-feet larger, providing more space for criminal investigations as well as a garage to execute search warrants on vehicles. “My biggest thing is that this building puts us in the middle of everything, where we should be,” Garcia said. “I would say that one out of every three people that come to me tell me, Chief, I am afraid to come to Walmart.

The governor’s press secretary Nora Meyers Sackett said the money was initially appropriated by the governor’s capital outlay in 2020 for statewide local emergency infrastructure. “What else do we want to lift everyone up here?” Lujan Grisham said while standing at a podium in front of the vacant building. “Because everything is not just possible; it is within our reach.

Got it Time Magazine, Parade and Buzzfeed have all named “Flirting with Fate” one of the most anticipated books of 2022, and the writer lives right here in Las Cruces. New York Times best-selling author Jennifer Cervantes will sign the brand-new young adult novel at an event at 3 p.m. Saturday, April 23, at Barnes & Noble Bookstore in the Mesilla Valley Mall, 700 S. Telshor Blvd. “Flirting with Fate” is “a celebration of the Mexican culture,” Cervantes said, and is reflective of the southern California family she was born and raised in, and the family she raised in Las Cruces with husband Joseph Cervantes, a lawyer and state senator. Like the Cervantes’ three daughters, the characters in the book “take care of each other and love each other,” Cervantes said. She called on memories from her own teen years and raising her girls to create the characters and their very real emotions. “We’ve all been through it,” Cervantes said. “We all know the saga of being a teenager.” The story of sisterhood also has the elements of magic that you will find in all Cervantes’ novels. “I always lean into magic realism,” she said. And, as she does with all her books, the first thing Cervantes imagined for “Flirting with Fate” was its opening scene. “I saw a woman on her deathbed, whispering into this young woman’s ear,” she said. “I wanted to know what she was whispering.” And clearly, readers want to know what Cervantes is writing: Seven publishing houses bid for the right to publish “Flirting with Fate,” her 10th book. Another young adult novel by Cervantes, “Fractured Path,” will be published this July. It is the third in Disney-Hyperion’s “The Mirror” fairytale quartet, which follows a family’s curse through multiple generations. Each of the four books is written by a different author. To write “Fractured Path,” which is set in northern California in 1965, Cervantes traveled to San Francisco, “just to get a sense of the streets she (lead character Blake) would have walked,” Cervantes said. That’s one of the perks of being a best-selling author: “I get to travel and do research in some pretty incredible places,” she said. The actual writing takes place in the in-home studio that Joseph created for her. (He has both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in architecture in addition to a juris doctorate.) “It means so much to me that he designed and built it,” Cervantes said. “He used his own magic so I could live in my imagination.” The studio’s bookcases are filled with books by Cervantes’ favorite authors, including thrillers, mysteries, romances and other genres. A particular favorite is “Big Magic” by Elizabeth Gilbert. “I love to read widely,” Cervantes said. There are also a few shelves devoted to her own books, showing them in at least 10 different languages from around the world. Cervantes will be needing even more space, with three more novels scheduled for publication in 2023. And, due out this October is “The Lords of Night,” the first book in her “Shadow Bruja” duology. Her books about Mesoamerican culture and lore “reflect the authenticity of the culture,” Cervantes said. “I take poetic license,” she said, to present the ancient Mayan civilization in such a way that young readers are entertained and also learn about a culture and civilization that few others are writing about. “The Lords of Night” and the books in Cervantes’ “Storm Runner” series also “help a kid parse out what’s real and what’s fantastical,” she said. It all began for Cervantes when she wrote “Tortilla Sun” in 2010 as a story for her youngest daughter about her treasured “Julie Bear” stuffed animal. Today, Cervantes is writing full time and connecting with readers across the country and around world in person and via Zoom. “Living a creative life is a beautiful way to live,” Cervantes said.
