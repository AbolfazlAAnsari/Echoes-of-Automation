The Marion Police Department said officers and sheriff's deputies with the Marion County Special Response Team executed a search warrant around 5 a.m. at the suspect's home, located in the 200 block of North Swain in the Village of LaRue. When law enforcement arrived, the suspect, identified by the sheriff's office as 38-year-old Travis Hellinger, left his house on foot towards nearby railroad tracks and was armed with at least three semiautomatic handguns. Hellinger later began walking down the railroad tracks while screaming at police. Police said officers pleaded with Hellinger to drop his weapons and deployed a K-9 in an attempt to end the standoff without gunfire. The suspect then opened fire and shot at the K-9 and officers. Officers returned fire and struck the suspect, who died after being transported to the hospital. No officers, including the K-9, were injured in the shooting. Officers and deputies involved in the shooting wore body cameras and footage will be given to the Ohio BCI for investigation, according to Marion Chief of Police Jay McDonald and Marion County Sheriff Matt Bayles.
