a successful three decades of music into a super-short Super Bowl halftime show a challenge, but the multiple Grammy winner decided to concentrate on past hits, moments from his popular Las Vegas residency and possibly draw from his new album. “I was very mindful of my past, celebrating my present, which is here in Las Vegas, and thinking about where we’re heading in the future,” the singer said when he addressed the media Thursday in advance of Sunday’s Super Bowl, which will be held at Las Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium, with the San Francisco 49ers facing off against the Kansas City Chiefs. He will release his ninth studio album “Coming Home” on Friday. Usher said he’s been asking himself, “What songs do people know me for, what songs have been a celebration of all of the journey?” The R&B singer thought about adding the roller skating element from his residency into his halftime performance, but he gave no other specific clues on where that process led him, and what his take on the global spectacle will look like. “For everybody who heard about my show in Las Vegas, you’ll now get a chance to see some of what I did here but you’ll get the best of it,” he said. Usher did not drop names of who might be joining him on stage, but he offered some vague hints. He confirmed that he won’t be alone at Allegiant Stadium. In previous years, most Super Bowl performers have included guest stars — except for Rihanna, who was a solo act last year. The singer suggested it would be people he’s collaborated with before. “I think I made it easy for myself when I decided to have featured artists on songs that became hit records. That gave me the greatest inspiration,” he said. “I have definitely gone through a lot of ideas of who I would have go through this moment with me That hardly narrows it down, however, given all the folks he’s collaborated with, from Beyoncé to Monica to Nicki Minaj to Ludacris to Lil Jon. Usher was a Super Bowl guest star himself, with Black Eyed Peas frontman will.i.am in 2011. He told The Associated Press previously that he’d use that performance as a “cheat sheet” for Sunday’s show. On Thursday, he said he had a harrowing moment getting there. “My hand got caught on a wire that was holding me 30 feet in the air, and I almost missed my entrance,” he said. He still managed to hit is mark — in the splits. But he would prefer to avoid that kind of mishap. Usher said he definitely aims to bring the flavor of Atlanta — a city where he made his musical name. His 100-show local residency in Las Vegas last year was a perfect workshop to help make that happen. “I’ve been able to bring a great deal of Atlanta and the melting pot that it is, musically and culturally, to Las Vegas,” he said. “It wasn’t easy to do but I turned Vegas into Atlanta. I took the V and turned it upside down.” An eight-time Grammy winner, Usher’s “Confessions” has sold more than 10 million units in the U.S. The album ranks among one of the best-selling music projects of all time and launched No. 1 hits such as “Yeah!” with Ludacris and Lil Jon, “Burn” and “Confessions Part II.” His special edition version included the smooth hit “My Boo,” a duet with Alicia Keys. Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the epic album. Usher joins a list of celebrated entertainers, who have played during the Super Bowl halftime shows, including Prince, Beyoncé, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Coldplay, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Last year, Rihanna chose her Super Bowl performance to tell the world she was pregnant with her second child. Usher spoke to the media not in a traditional news conference format but via an interview with Apple Music’s Nadeska Alexis in front of an audience full of reporters that was streamed on its platform and social media sites. The news conference also featured pre-game performers including Reba McEntire, Post Malone and Andra Day. ___ AP’s Super Bowl news: https://apnews.com/hub/super-bowl Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

delivered straight to your email inbox. A special counsel report released Thursday found evidence that President Joe Biden willfully retained and shared highly classified information when he was a private citizen, including about military and foreign policy in Afghanistan, but concluded that criminal charges were not warranted. The report from special counsel Robert Hur resolves a criminal investigation that had shadowed Biden\'s presidency for the last year. But its bitingly critical assessment of his handling of sensitive government records and unflattering characterizations of his memory will spark fresh questions about his competency and age that cut at voters’ most deep-seated concerns about his candidacy for re-election. Beyond that, the harsh findings will almost certainly blunt his ability to forcefully condemn Donald Trump, Biden\'s likely opponent in November\'s presidential election, over a criminal indictment charging the former president with illegally hoarding classified records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Despite abundant differences between the cases, Trump immediately seized on the special counsel report to portray himself as a victim of a “two-tiered system of justice.” Yet even as Hur found evidence that Biden willfully held onto and shared with a ghostwriter highly classified information, the special counsel devoted much of his report to explaining why he did not believe the evidence met the standard for criminal charges, including a high probability that the Justice Department would not be able to prove Biden’s intent beyond a reasonable doubt, citing among other things an advanced age that they said made him forgetful and the possibility of “innocent explanations” for the records that they could not refute. In remarks at the White House, Biden angrily lashed out at the special counsel for questioning his recollection of his late son Beau\'s death from cancer. “How in the hell dare he raise that?"" Biden asked, saying he didn\'t believe it was any of Hur\'s business. Speaking to reporters, Biden asserted, “My memory is fine,"" and insisted he believes he remains the most qualified person to serve as president. Video below: \'My memory is fine:\' President Biden responds to special counsel\'s report Biden\'s lawyers blasted the report for what they said were inaccuracies and gratuitous swipes at the president. In a statement, Biden said he was “pleased” Hur had “reached the conclusion I believed all along they would reach — that there would be no charges brought in this case and the matter is now closed.” He pointedly noted that he had sat for five hours of in-person interviews in the immediate aftermath of Hamas\'s October attack on Israel, when ""I was in the middle of handling an international crisis.” “I just believed that’s what I owed the American people so they could know no charges would be brought and the matter closed,” Biden said. The investigation into Biden is separate from special counsel Jack Smith’s inquiry into the handling of classified documents by Trump after Trump left the White House. Smith’s team has charged Trump with illegally retaining top secret records at his Mar-a-Lago home and then obstructing government efforts to get them back. Trump has said he did nothing wrong. Hur, a former U.S. Attorney in the Trump administration, was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland as special counsel in January 2023 following an initial discovery by Biden staff of classified records in Washington office space. Subsequent property searches by the FBI, all coordinated voluntarily by Biden staff, that turned up additional sensitive documents from his time as vice president and senator. Hur\'s report said many of the documents recovered at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, in parts of Biden\'s Delaware home and in his Senate papers at the University of Delaware were retained by “mistake.” Read: President Biden issues statement in response to special counsel classified documents report Biden could not have been prosecuted as a sitting president, but Hur’s report states that he would not recommend charges against Biden regardless. “We would reach the same conclusion even if Department of Justice policy did not foreclose criminal charges against a sitting president,” the report said. But investigators did find evidence of willful retention and disclosure of a subset of records found in Biden\'s Wilmington, Delaware house, including in a garage, office and basement den. The files pertain to a troop surge in Afghanistan during the Obama administration that Biden had vigorously opposed. He kept records that documented his position, including a classified letter to Obama during the 2009 Thanksgiving holiday. Documents found in a box in Biden\'s Delaware garage have classification markings up to the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information Level and “other materials of great significance to him and that he appears to have personally used and accessed.” Hur, though, wrote that there was a ”shortage of evidence"" to prove that Biden placed the documents in the box and knew they were there.

The U.S. president made his comments as Scholz amplified growing concerns in Europe about the standoff between the Democratic president and House Republicans on Ukraine funding. American officials have said that the inability to come to terms on a new aid package is endangering Ukraine’s efforts to repel the nearly two-year Russian invasion. “Without the support of United States, and without the support of the European states, Ukraine will have not a chance to defend its own country,” Scholz said. Scholz came to Washington looking to emphasize the stakes of the debate for Europe and beyond as House Republicans have blocked new U.S. funding. Republicans are arguing that the United States can’t afford to keep pouring billions of dollars of taxpayer money into Ukraine’s war effort and that Europe should do more for Kyiv. Meanwhile, Biden sought to use his meeting with the German leader to once again pressure Republicans to stand by its European allies. “The failure of the United States Congress, if it occurs, not to support Ukraine, is close to criminal neglect,” Biden said. “It is outrageous.” Before the White House meeting, Scholz said that backing away from support for Kyiv would have consequences beyond Ukraine and could prove more costly to Western governments in the long run. “Others around the world are watching closely to see whether these divisions can be exploited and whether disinformation campaigns can take hold,” Scholz wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Thursday. “We must prove them wrong by convincing citizens on both sides of the Atlantic that a Russian victory would make the world a far more dangerous place. It would also strain our budgets while putting the freedom and prosperity of each of us in peril.” Republicans this week blocked a $118 bipartisan border package that had been tied to Ukraine funding and aid for Israel. The Senate on Thursday voted to begin work on a narrower package that would include roughly $60 billion for Ukraine and $35 billion for Israel, but doubts remained about whether it could win enough support from Republicans for passage. The impasse has meant that the U.S. has halted arms shipments to Kyiv at a crucial point in the nearly two-year-old conflict, leaving Ukrainian soldiers without ample ammunition and missiles as Russian President Vladimir Putin has mounted relentless attacks. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with some $111 billion since Putin launched his grinding invasion. Scholz also spotlighted during his quick visit to Washington what the 27-member European Union has done recently to help the Ukraine cause, including paving the way for EU membership talks for Ukraine, and underscoring that Germany is planning more than 7 billion euros ($7.5 billion) for weapons deliveries despite a domestic budget crisis. Heather Conley, president of the German Marshall Fund in Washington, said that Scholz was also looking to hear from Biden on his “Plan B” if Congress remains at loggerheads over funding for Ukraine. “If in fact, there is no forthcoming U.S. supplemental, what tools does the U.S. administration have at its disposal?” Conley said. Scholz said that he was hopeful the effort to separate Ukraine funding will end the funding impasse. The German leader hosted a bipartisan group of eight senators for dinner on Thursday evening after arriving in Washington. “The president is very clear, and we agree: If it is not possible to bring about a decision in the American Congress that releases funding for the further support of Ukraine, then that is a threat to Ukraine’s ability to defend itself,” Scholz said following the meeting. “That’s why we are both very firmly convinced that this must happen now, but also confident that the American Congress will in the end make such a decision.” Biden, however, noted to Scholz at the start of the Oval Office meeting that House Republicans still remain “somewhat reluctant.” U.S. officials are also concerned that the funding impasse is shaping Moscow’s strategy, noting a surge in strikes targeting Ukraine’s defense industrial base that seems aimed at setting back Ukraine’s ability to produce munitions needed to defend itself. “The president believes that support for Ukraine is critical, particularly right now, as Russia continues to try to hit their defense industrial base,” Kirby said. Scholz recently called on other European countries to step up with more weapons deliveries for Ukraine, saying that “it can’t be down to Germany alone.” Berlin is making “a very big contribution, but it won’t be enough on its own if sufficient support doesn’t come together everywhere,” Scholz said before departing Germany for Washington on Thursday. “Now is the moment for us to do what is necessary — give Ukraine the possibility to defend itself, and at the same time send the Russian president a very clear signal: the signal that he can’t expect our support to ease off.” ___ AP video journalist Tracy Brown contributed to this report.

KTBS is told a proposal is in the works to possibly shut down the westbound lane of I-20 between Industrial Drive and Hamilton Road in Bossier. The lane could remain closed through the remainder of the construction project. That portion has been the site of more than 200 crashes involving tractor-trailers and other vehicles, causing it to be shut down for a few hours at a time or up to 24 or more hours. The big rigs have been the most at-fault since the one open lane has been narrowed from 12 feet to about 9 feet, leaving little wiggle room. Because of that, the state Department of Transportation and Development banned all 18-wheelers from the construction zone and directed all to the Interstate 220 detour. Assorted signs are positioned along the interstate warning of violations. At first, state troopers wrote warnings to offenders. But as the commercial vehicle drivers continued to ignored the ban, troopers began writing tickets. So far, more than 500 have been handed out. Initial work on the bumpy intersection section began in September, when the outside shoulder was rebuilt to handle traffic. Then in December, the $117.6 million project moved to the second phase. That’s when the concrete barriers were moved in to separate the outside traffic from what contractors are doing on the inside. The anticipated completion date of the project is late 2025. Success!

Trump’s delay tactics are a well-worn strategy by the former president and his legal teams to bend circumstances in his favor. And now, with an appeals court weighing whether he’s protected from prosecution by presidential immunity, Trump’s goal of facing voters before he faces a federal jury is growing likelier with the judge issuing a full stop on trial proceedings in Washington until that determination is made. “I am officially now at the freakout stage,” Obama-era acting U.S. Solicitor General Neal Katyal told MSNBC on Sunday. Anticipation had run high that the three-judge D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel would rule quickly, as the panel agreed to expedite the case and directed the attorneys to file their written briefs on the Saturdays preceding Christmas and New Year’s, no less. But four weeks after oral arguments, the panel has still not handed down their decision. Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has issued a full stop on the trial proceedings, indefinitely delaying Trump’s trial once set for March 4. That only bolsters Trump’s strategy to run out the clock and potentially pardon himself of the federal charges should he again win the White House, sidelining prosecution before a conviction. The stalling has thrown anti-Trump legal pundits into full spiral, warning that it could only help the likely GOP nominee who is polling, at times, neck and neck with President Biden. Norm Eisen, counsel for the Democrats in Trump’s first impeachment, called the lack of a ruling a “temporary win” for the former president. “We’ve been waiting, clock’s running, we’ve been waiting almost four weeks,” Eisen said on CNN over the weekend. “I think we’ll get something from them. I hope we’ll get something from them soon,” he added. Recent surveys have somewhat tipped the scale in terms of how voters feel about casting a ballot for Trump should he be convicted before Election Day. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll last week found more than half of battleground state voters, including nearly a quarter, or 23 percent, of Republicans, would not vote for Trump should he be convicted. That figure rises to 55 percent should Trump be sentenced to prison. A CNN poll this week found that most voters want to see prosecution of the election subversion case before voting in November. Trump was charged with four counts in August alleging he conspired to overturn the 2020 election and spurred his supporters to disrupt the Jan. 6, 2021, congressional certification of the results, one of four indictments he faces. Trump pleaded not guilty to all the charges. For one of his pretrial defenses in the Jan. 6 case, Trump has contended he has criminal immunity for official acts during his presidency. Chutkan, an appointee of former President Obama, rejected that argument, bringing the novel constitutional issue before the three-judge D.C. Circuit panel. During the hour-plus oral argument last month — at which Trump was present — the panel appeared unconvinced by Trump’s lawyers’ claims that a president can’t be prosecuted if not first impeached and convicted by Congress. But the three judges, one former President George H.W. Bush appointee and two President Biden appointees, did signal at least some disagreement, leaving the exact contours of their ruling a mystery. The court has been silent ever since. With no formal rules to force a judge to release its decision quicker, the nature of the internal deliberations — and the reason behind the holdup — remain unclear. “At what point does the DC Circuit Chief Judge speak to Judge Henderson to politely tell her to SNAPADOODLE in the Trump immunity decision? I’d say, about a week ago!” Andrew Weissmann, a prosecutor for special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. A decision in the coming days would still be speedy compared with the D.C. Circuit’s normal operations. Nonexpedited cases typically take months to progress through the process. To keep his election subversion case on track, special counsel Jack Smith sought to avoid timing complications at the D.C. Circuit by asking the Supreme Court to leapfrog the process and immediately take up the immunity issue. But the justices rejected the request, so Smith will now have to race against the clock, with the future of his prosecution potentially on the line. One way or another, the immunity issue is widely expected to eventually land at the Supreme Court. But first, the side that loses before the three-judge D.C. Circuit panel could eat up additional time by asking the full appeals court bench to reconsider the ruling. If the case does eventually move ahead after the appeals process is exhausted, Trump’s trial still won’t be immediate, with the judges still needing to consider an array of pretrial motions, which could take weeks or months. And once the case does reach trial? Smith previously projected the government’s case will take four to six weeks to present. Altogether, a possible verdict is inching toward the vicinity of the Nov. 5 presidential election — or even afterwards. “I have no idea what the Court of Appeals is doing right now,” Katyal told MSNBC. “This is a real problem,” he added.
