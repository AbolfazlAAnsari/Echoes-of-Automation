A combination of weather changes and a dramatic decrease in human use has resulted in the perfect storm of opportunity for growth and renewal. The building block to any marine ecosystem is algae. Micro-algae like zooxanthellae (the algae that lives in coral and gives it energy to grow and reproduce) and macro-algae (limu or seaweed, that provides food for marine life and us as well) are critical to any healthy marine ecosystem. “One of the most beautiful kilo (observations) we’ve made over the past couple months is a boom of algae growth in the tide pools. Thousands of feet usually scrub the algae off so it never has a chance to grow, but now every submerged area is covered in a fine carpet of limu,” says Jenny Yagodich, MPW’s Director of educational programs. The recent break from humans and a naturally occurring growth season have resulted in an abundance of limu in areas researchers have not seen before. “We’ve been surveying and keeping track of the limu that grows here for many years. Most of the limu grows out on the reef flats…we never really see much in the tide pools. During our last kilo session, however, we documented 10 native limu varieties all within the tide pools” Yagodich said. Herbivorous fish such as Manini (convict tang), Uhu (parrotfish), Kala (bluespine unicornfish), and Umauma Lei (orangespine unicornfish) help to keep the reef habitat healthy. In the tide pools, an increase in turf algae has led to an increase in juveniles of these species. “The whole point of a Marine Life Conservation District is spillover – the hope is that fish and other marine life will have a healthy, abundant area in which to grow and reproduce, then they will spill over into outlying areas. If their food source, limu, is not here, they won’t be able to be here either,” adds Yagodich. Following pono practices such as not stepping on the reef or submerged rocks, not using sunscreens that contain damaging chemicals such as oxybenzone, avobenzone, and octinoxate, and not touching or altering the behavior of marine life all help to ensure that the progress the marine ecosystem has made recently will continue. As a reminder, the Pupukea Marine Life Conservation District is a no-take area, but in other areas where take is allowed, here are some great things to know: • Limu doesn’t have roots like land plants and trees. Instead, they have a “holdfast” used to anchor themselves onto the reef and rocks. When collecting limu, never pull the holdfast off, rather, pinch or cut the limu leaving an inch or two attached to the reef…it will grow back! • Limu is good for you! It’s full of vitamins like vitamin C, minerals like iron, and fiber. • Limu is responsible for over 75% of the world’s oxygen! Phytoplankton, a type of marine algae, carry out photosynthesis using carbon dioxide and water to generate food for themselves, while giving out oxygen as a waste product. • Not only does seaweed help the natural cycle of the oceans but they also provide shelter and breeding grounds for the marine life that live with them. When you collect limu, be sure to remove all the critters so they can continue to grow. • Limu is traditionally used in ceremony here in Hawai‘i. Limu Kala (Sargassum spp.), for example, is used in conflict resolution ceremonies called Ho‘oponopono (kala means “to forgive”).

Can you also imagine how these five strong young men felt when they said good bye to their parents to come to Hawai‘i as 1946 Sakadas? These brothers were: Mariano, Paulino, Marcelino, Valentine and Sesinando Sagayaga. Perhaps “courage” is the key word for both parents and their sons. As Bethany Hamilton, a shark attack survivor puts it, “Courage doesn’t mean you don’t get afraid. Courage means you don’t let fear stop you.” Today, only one of the five Sagayaga brothers is still alive—Sesinando Sagayaga, who is now 95 years old. This month’s Sakada Offspring is Anita Sagayaga Fernandez, one of the daughters of Sesinando. She was born on July 15, 1956 in Pu‘unēnē, Maui, Hawai‘i at the Pu‘unēnē Plantation Hospital located at Hansen Road. The Sagayaga’s first home was at Young Hee Camp near the Hongwanji Church. When Anita was five years old, her family moved to the 6th increment in Kahului. She attended Lihikai School on Ka‘ahumanu Ave. located across the Maui Beach Hotel and then moved to the new Lihikai School on Papa Ave. in the 3rd grade. She graduated from St. Anthony High School. After high school, she ventured to California attending University of San Francisco earning a Bachelor of Science Degree in Biology. Anita is married to Clayton Fernandez. He works at Tri Isle Inc. as warehouse foreman. Their daughter Christina Parilla is a former pre-school teacher at Maui Economic Opportunity Headstart and at the Christ The King Child Development Center. She now owns a day care center. Christina is married to Dwight Parilla Jr. They have a daughter Amanda. Their son Chad is an electrical engineer, working for the County of Maui, Department of Public Works. He is married to Mandy Santos. They have a son Luke. Anita’s siblings are Charles, Nancy and Shirley. Charles is married to Rose Macadangdang. They have a son Chris and a daughter Kacie. Charles works for Maui Memorial Medical Center. Nancy is married to Michael Tanji. They have two stepchildren Mychal Tanji and Marisa Waits. Nancy works for the County of Maui Real Property Tax Division. Shirley is married to Jack Carlisle. They have three children Mitchell, Megan and Matthew. Shirley works in a dental office at Richard Roudebush Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Indianapolis, Indiana. At Maui Memorial Hospital (1980–1990), Anita was a lab assistant. She performed phlebotomy duties and assisted technicians in preparing patients’ samples for testing. In 1991–2011, she was Sanitary Chemist IV at the County of Maui Department of Environmental Management Wastewater Division Central Laboratory. She supervised the laboratory and performed different analytical testing on wastewater samples to comply with State and Federal regulations. The County of Maui began a reclamation program in recycling the wastewater by treating the wastewater in different processes to produce clean water safe for irrigation. Anita was awarded the Manager of the Year for County of Maui, Department of Public Works for 1999–2000. Anita is very active in the community. At Christ the King Catholic Church, she is involved in the Hospital, Charity Walk, People in Care Facility, Food Pantry and Eucharistic Ministries. At Kaunoa Senior Center, she is a member of the Advisory Council Board and volunteers in the office performing clerical duties. Baking is one of Anita’s favorite hobbies and interests. She enjoys doing different crafts activities as well as watching softball and dancing hula. Most of all, she enjoys spending time with her grandchildren and family. Clayton and Anita are involved in Worldwide Marriage Encounter Movement. They attended their first encounter weekend in 2008, on their 27th wedding anniversary. They wanted to share their personal reflection regarding the weekend. “It is a special feeling, knowing God has blessed us to be together. We learned that our spouse is very special and not to take each other for granted. It is a celebration of the Sacrament of Marriage. It is written in the Bible to love God and He says to love one another. Marriage is a holy relationship with each other and with God. We pray that more couples may experience a Marriage Encounter weekend to enhance their marriage to be better. The weekend provides tools in communication and sharing one’s feelings which helps to enhance relationship and love for each other.” Anita and her siblings are very caring of their 95-year old Dad, Sesinando Sagayaga, a 1946 Sakada. I previously had the privilege to talk and listen to Sesinando’s interesting and informative Sakada story. Sesinando was born in Bacarra, Ilocos Norte on July 12, 1925. He left the Philippines on April 9, 1946 aboard the S.S. Maunawili, at Port Salomague in Cabugao, Ilocos Sur, Philippines. According to him, they climbed a ladder made out of rope to get on the S.S. Maunawili. Like many of the other Sakadas, he came to Hawai‘i to find a better life for himself and his family. Upon arrival at the Kahului Harbor on April 27, 1946, Sesinando and the other Sakadas were transported to Spanish B Camp in Pu‘unēnē, a camp located by the old Holy Family Catholic Church. Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Co. (HC&S) provided all of their basic needs. Sesinando lived with several Sakadas in one house. Life at Spanish B Camp according to Sesinando was a very memorable one. It was a very closed knit community where they shared many things with one another like a big family. They shared such things as vegetables that they gathered from the field or from their backyard garden. They slaughtered pigs or cows and shared. Slaughtering in their backyard was allowable and legal in those days. How fresh the meats must have been! After six months at Spanish B Camp, Sesinando moved to Young Hee Camp near the Hongwanji Church. He lived there until 1960 when the camps were being phased out. While at HC&S, Sesinando first cut grass, joined the poison gang (poisoned the weeds) and later the harvesting gang (collect and pile up the sugar cane stalks to be picked up by the harvesting machine). Then he joined the replant gang (replacing the dead sugar canes) (agsugot). He then joined the irrigation gang (agpadanum), directing the water flow to the fields. His main area to work was where the Assembly of God Church and Home Depot are today. That area used to be all sugarcane fields. He mentioned the late Julian Cabalo as his buddy in the irrigation gang. They were paid 43 cents per hour. If they worked more than 25 working days a month, they would receive 7 more cents as a bonus. He worked in the irrigation department until his retirement in 1987. At the camp, a store boy would go around and take orders from the Sakadas. Their groceries would be charged from their paychecks. With a big smile on his face, as if he is happy remembering the past, Sesinando enjoyed talking about their social activities at the camp. He said there were lots of dancing, social boxes in which the men could bid. They would pay for each dance. The money that’s produced from these social dances are given to the queen contestants (candidatas) of their choice. Some of the men got carried away in dancing too much that at the end of the month, they had nothing or very little left on their paychecks. Sesinando remembered that on October 1951, he decided to go back to Bacarra to marry a beautiful young lady by the name of Dominga Dolores Yanos whom he knew since childhood. He said this was the first time he set foot in Manila because as a child, he didn’t have the opportunity to go there. With a twinkle in his eyes and with pride in his voice, he mentioned that Dominga was beautiful, loyal, and faithful that even though several young men in Bacarra wanted to court and marry her, she waited for her Sesinando. Upon arrival in Bacarra, “Nando” as he was fondly called, visited Dominga right away. Dominga and Sesinando corresponded with each other when he was in Hawai‘i. They respected their tradition of danon where the parents of both children got together and did the marriage proposal and the wedding arrangements. The wedding ceremony was held in Bacarra and a grand reception was held at Nando’s house. Sesinando came back to Hawai‘i on March 1952. Dominga followed him soon after. Their eldest child Anita was born under the care of the late HC&S doctor, Edward B. Underwood. As mentioned previously, Sesinando and Dominga were blessed with four very caring and loving children. Sesinando was asked what his advice was to older folks like him and the younger ones. He said “To the old folks like me, I would say enjoy your grandchildren. When I was younger,'}]"

Then, during a morning jog along the beach, someone discovered a freshly killed, bloody corpse (probably a smuggler) the day we left the resort town Kompong Som. A stark reminder that we are still in Cambodia – where at times life can seem cheap, and security must be taken seriously.” In May 1996, I moved to Phnom Penh, Cambodia to set up and manage UNICEF’s country program assistance to government, NGOs and international organizations as part of the Mekong Region STD/HIV/AIDS Project, a new regional project implemented in six countries bordering the Mekong River: Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. Still reeling in the aftermath of the Khmer Rouge’s reign of terror (1975-1979) that resulted in the deaths of up to three million people or nearly a quarter of the 1975 population through execution, torture, starvation, and disease. Tragically, in the mid-1990’s Cambodia was experiencing the most serious and rapidly progressing HIV/AIDS epidemic in Asia, and was on the brink of becoming one of the worst affected countries in the world. For the majority of Cambodians, HIV/AIDS was not considered a priority concern. Disruption and weakening of the family and community, as well as continued armed conflict and extensive poverty following years of turmoil had resulted in large numbers of young people, women and children living in especially difficult circumstances. The rapid transition to a free market economy, increased population mobility, the opening of borders, and other liberalizing measures implemented with little apparent guidance or regulation were also contributing to the explosive spread of HIV in Cambodia. The primary mode of HIV transmission was unprotected heterosexual intercourse. Women especially faced an enormous challenge from HIV. National HIV Sentinel Surveillance had found that over 40% of the commercial sex-workers tested and nearly 2% of pregnant women attending ante-natal clinics were HIV-infected. Even among those who were not occupationally exposed in Cambodia’s growing commercial sex industry, women were increasingly at risk for infection from their husbands and boyfriends. UNICEF’s chief strategy was to raise the capacity of counterpart organizations at local levels, working in collaboration with target populations assessed to be most vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including HIV. These included students in primary, secondary and vocational schools, non-formal education participants, out-of-school youth, women of reproductive age, and women and children directly affected by HIV and AIDS – especially rural people and ethnic minorities who faced a higher risk for HIV infection because of their marginal status. Because so many of the educated Khmer had either died, were badly traumatized, or had fled the country to escape the horrors carried out by the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot, the few remaining qualified government counterparts UNICEF could work with were stretched to the limit and often unavailable as they faced enormous challenges of competing priorities in health, education, social welfare, and other sectors that UNICEF supported. Project Officer for STD/HIV/AIDS As UNICEF’s Project Officer for STD/HIV/AIDS, I was responsible for the planning, development and management of technical and financial assistance on all aspects of Project implementation to establish Cambodia’s component of UNICEF’s Mekong Region STD/HIV/AIDS Project. Through on-going situation analysis, awareness-raising, human resource needs assessment and training, the Project raised the capacity of government agencies, NGOs, local communities and the UNICEF country office to design, test, implement, monitor and evaluate activities to reduce HIV/AIDS transmission and increase community acceptance and care for women, children and families affected by the illness. As the leading multilateral agency supporting Cambodia’s National HIV/AIDS Program and its multiple implementing partners at national, provincial and community levels, a major challenge was coordinating these important and wide-ranging efforts for maximum impact. A swim each evening at the International Youth Club pool was refreshing and helped ease the strain, followed by a bowl of noodle soup from my favorite street vendor and a loaf of hot, crispy French bread from the ‘Nom Pang’ (bread) vendor whose ‘Pang Pang’ cries echoed through the streets as he peddled his bike through the night. Of course, it was prudent, especially after dark, to carry a readily accessible $20 bill to hand off in a hurry if confronted by armed robbers roaming the streets. Once known as the “Pearl of Asia,” Phnom Penh was considered one of the loveliest French-built cities in Indochina in the 1920’s. Sadly, in the mid-90’s, the city was a stinking mudslide when it rained, and a heavily trashed dust bowl the rest of the time, especially because of the growing traffic on the largely unpaved roads. Of course, a big challenge was simply managing the energy drain and overall depressing nature of the place. Rampant corruption, civil war and subsequent political purges, AIDS, poor illiterate peasants, beggars, amputees, child prostitution, orphans – it was going to take time to recover from such horrific trauma and suffering. Strolling home from the pool each night under the stars, twinkling through the coconut palms – down the quiet, dusty back streets, a few fires burning in the darkness, migrant workers and their families huddled in ramshackle shelters. A few guys shooting snooker, a scuttering rat or two in the rotting rubbish piles and stagnant pools of stinking water, past a small market area behind the crumbling hospital next to a temple. But as usual, there was not much worth buying or eating – except a roast banana or perhaps a blackened, rock-hard baguette from the mobile hot bread-seller. Again, the positive and stimulating nature of my work at UNICEF is what saved me. Grateful for the pool, for quiet, walkable streets with (at that time) only limited motorized traffic, and the stamina to respond to the swarms of kids desperately seeking attention and love – and yet somehow, still bursting with boundless youthful exuberance.

DeVinck and the Pearlmans were among the hundreds of passengers who were stuck aboard the cruise ship after five ports denied the vessel entry over fears of the coronavirus, though none of the passengers had tested positive for the disease. Photo courtesy Robert DeVinck When Wailea resident Robert DeVinck booked a 30-day cruise through Asia one year ago, there was no way he could’ve known that the outbreak of a virus and the quarantine of a cruise ship would coincide precisely with his vacation. But now here he was, stuck on another cruise ship that no country would accept and turning on the news every morning to find them smack dab in the spotlight. “We were being talked about around the news while we were out in the middle of nowhere in the South China Sea,” DeVinck said. While none of the passengers aboard the Westerdam had tested positive for the novel coronavirus sweeping through mainland China, the growing epidemic had stoked enough fears that five different ports had denied the ship entry — and it became increasingly unclear when the 1,455 passengers and 802 crew would get to go home. “For healthy passengers on a boat, we were just looking for a savior out at sea, and Cambodia ended up being that savior,” DeVinck said. The MS Westerdam is seen docked in Sihanoukville, Cambodia. The feel-good story of how Cambodia allowed a cruise ship to dock after it was turned away elsewhere in Asia for fear of spreading the deadly virus that began in China has taken a turn after a passenger released from the ship tested positive for the virus. AP Photo DeVinck returned to Maui on Sunday, two days after Cambodia allowed the Westerdam to dock and disembark its passengers. However, an American woman, who was on the ship, later tested positive for the disease. Hawaii health officials have said that the risk is low for the other passengers of the Westerdam, at least four of whom are Hawaii residents. Of the four, DeVinck is the only one from Maui. “DOH was advised that the situation is low risk for all passengers because the individual developed symptoms after leaving the ship,” said Janice Okubo, spokeswoman for the state Department of Health, on Wednesday. “DOH was provided contact information for the four passengers and is contacting all of them. As more information becomes available and if federal guidance changes, we will adjust our approach.” DeVinck booked his cruise a year ago and had been looking forward to it. The first two weeks, starting in mid-January, couldn’t have been better as they toured famous landmarks and temples throughout Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. Then Westerdam docked in Hong Kong to pick up another round of passengers for the second leg of the tour, which was supposed to last from Feb. 1 to 15 and end in Shanghai, DeVinck said. Unfortunately, the new round of passengers “never touched land again until we got to Cambodia.” Robert DeVinck dines in the Pinnacle Grill alongside a waiter, Frank. DeVinck said the crew and passengers grew close throughout their time at sea. On Friday, they were allowed to dock in Cambodia and disembark. Photo courtesy Robert DeVinck The novel coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, had only started to become a global problem once DeVinck was on the ship. China had reported its first death from the new disease, which broke out in Wuhan in Hubei province, on Jan. 11, shortly before millions would travel across the country for the Lunar New Year. By Jan. 30, the World Health Organization had declared a global health emergency. On Feb. 5, the Diamond Princess cruise ship was quarantined off of Yokohama, Japan, following a two-week trip through Southeast Asia. Growing numbers of passengers began testing positive for the virus in what became the largest cluster of people infected outside of mainland China. All this set the stage for how countries would receive the Westerdam. After the cruise ship canceled its Shanghai plans, port after port turned it away. The captain would be told one day that they were going to dock in one place, only to be denied and forced to turn around. Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines, Guam — all said no. Flights home were constantly booked and canceled. “It was such a roller coaster for the passengers, and I’m posting all this stuff on Facebook,” DeVinck said. “One day I’m saying, ‘Hallelujah, we’re coming home from Tokyo,’ the next day, ‘never mind.’ Tomorrow’s post is ‘now we’re flying home from Bangkok, God bless the Thailand government.’ It was a constant drama for everybody involved — those that were watching from home and those of us that were on the ship.” As ports continued to deny the ship, the Westerdam became the increasing focus of media attention. DeVinck would wake up in the morning, turn on the news, and find out things about the ship before the captain came over the intercom. People were already on edge about the Diamond Princess, and it didn’t help that the media “married our stories together.” “In the articles that were being written, they would one minute be talking about the Diamond Princess that was quarantined with actual people with coronavirus on that ship, and the story would slowly meld into the Westerdam and how we were being turned away by countries,” DeVinck said. “Unless you’re the most astute reader in the world . . . it’s all sounding the same to you, and I think these countries were like, ‘We don’t want cruise ships no matter what.’ ” But, DeVinck and his fellow passengers realized there was little they could do, and all things considered, “we had what I call Cadillac problems.” They still had morning massages, ate surf and turf for dinner, enjoyed shows and karaoke at night and gambled in the casino. Passengers and crew grew close, and anytime DeVinck felt sorry for himself, he thought of one Filipino crew member who was trying to get off the ship to see his newborn baby, “and realized our problems were small compared to this poor Filipino crew man.” “The crew did an amazing job of keeping the spirits high, and overall spirits were high,” DeVinck said. “But it was disconcerting. I’d be lying to you if I said it wasn’t. Then we started slowly running out of supplies.” One day they were out of ketchup. Then Budweiser. Then honey. “But then we had lobster for dinner,” DeVinck said. “So we don’t have ketchup, but we still have lobster. Again, they’re Cadillac problems.” But many passengers were elderly and anxious to get back home. So when Cambodia finally allowed them to dock in Sihanoukville, the crew and passengers held an emotional celebration at the ship’s bow the night before disembarking. “The emotion in this room, the sense of thanksgiving coming from the passengers and the visceral emotion, the crying of the crew members who were just so thankful for the relationship, this fraternity, this camaraderie we share now,” DeVinck recalled. On Friday morning, DeVinck walked out onto his veranda to the sight of the Cambodian prime minister’s helicopter landing next to the ship to greet the passengers with flowers, a welcome sight for the Westerdam but a controversial move to many countries who worried about the continued spread of the virus — especially after the discovery that an American passenger who had flown to Malaysia later tested positive. DeVinck, who disembarked Saturday and flew home Sunday through Seoul, Tokyo and Honolulu, emphasized that they were checked numerous times on the ship, and that all passengers with cold-like symptoms were tested with negative results for the virus. He also had to pass through temperature scanners on the ship and in South Korea and Japan. Holland America later said that, per the Cambodian Ministry of Health, 781 Westerdam guests had tested negative for COVID-19. “I understand the fear. I understand it entirely. But again, I can only speak for myself, and I was 100 percent healthy the entire trip,” DeVinck said. “I was tested multiple times myself, as we all were.” DeVinck said he knows there will be some stigma now that he’s back on Maui, but that “he can’t help that” and is just following Health Department instructions. He does not have to be under quarantine but must report his temperature twice a day to a health official. He’s been allowed to go out in public with his children and grandchildren, who are visiting Maui on a previously planned trip.
