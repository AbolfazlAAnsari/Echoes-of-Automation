Chief Executive Bernard Looney said that the cuts will affect office-based roles in BP’s global workforce of 70,000 people and come mostly this year. The changes are expected to significantly affect senior levels, cutting the number of group leaders by a third. “We are spending much, much more than we make – I am talking millions of dollars, every day,” Looney said in an email to staff that revealed that net debt rose by $6 billion in the first quarter. “We have to spend less money.” He pledged to bring down capital expenditure by 25% this year, a reduction of around $3 billion. He also said that it costs $22 billion a year to run the company, including $8 billion in people costs. “So we are driving down those operating costs by $2.5 billion in 2021 – and we will likely have to go even further,” he said. The job cuts come at a time of tremendous change for London-based BP. It had already embarked on a restructuring plan to ensure its long-term viability as the world decreases its reliance on fossil fuels in an effort to fight climate change. BP wants to eliminate or offset all carbon emissions from its operations and the oil and gas it sells to customers by 2050, an ambitious target. The wider energy industry has meanwhile been hit hard by the pandemic as the widespread limits on business, travel and public life reduced the need for oil, gas and other fuels. Supply of oil and gas was particularly high when the outbreak began, creating a perfect storm for the industry. With storage facilities filling up, the U.S. price of oil went below zero in April for the first time ever. “To me, the broader economic picture and our own financial position just reaffirm the need to reinvent BP,” Looney said in the email. “While the external environment is driving us to move faster – and perhaps go deeper at this stage than we originally intended – the direction of travel remains the same.” The U.S. contract for crude oil began the year at over $60 a barrel, collapsed to below -$37 in April and recovered to about $39 a barrel as of Monday as OPEC countries agreed to limit production. David Elmes, who leads the Global Energy Research Network at Warwick Business School, said BP’s cuts are symptomatic of the wider challenges facing the industry, with firms in the sector thinking about cutting costs. “BP and the other European-based international companies have already said they will become less focused on oil and gas over time,” he said. “If this situation continues, there will be intense discussions about what can they do to move faster.” Major companies like BP with diversified businesses are likely to survive the pandemic, but smaller oil producers are going to have a harder time, analysts say. U.S. shale companies in particular took on a lot of debt to finance operations and can only make ends meet at about $40 a barrel. Heavily-indebted companies will have to refinance at a time of capital constraint. Some companies are already going under.

A happy honeycomb with busy bees. https://www.grantcountybeat.com/images/2020newsitems/front-page-news/Bee-hive-re-homed/IMG_8933.jpg This story began on June 16, when a powerful windstorm blew a big cottonwood limb down. The big limb caught another limb and tore the front face of that limb off as it came down. The front face was the protection on the east side for an active honeybee hive. These poor bees were upset. The old comb fell to the ground and the worker bees quickly surrounded their honey stores and their queen. This limb was up in the cottonwood tree about 35 feet, too high to reach to try to ""capture"" the hive. We called local beekeeper, and bee charmer (literally) Travis Kirkland. He came by the next morning to offer suggestions. The height was still a major drawback. Some plans were made, and action was begun to see how to save this hive. Meanwhile, the height issue continued to be a problem. Then on July 21, another windstorm blows through and lo and behold, the hive limb comes down, hangs up on a limb held by the telephone line. Now, we\'re within reach. Travis and his helper, Bill Overholt, came over for another visit and a revised plan. The plan was to keep the hive together in the limb, trim as much as possible off the ends and place the hive and limb into a big box (top-bar-hive style) and thus protect them, especially before winter. This move happened on July 25 and I\'m happy to report that the bees are working from their new home going in and out with their little legs loaded with pollen to store more for winter. Pollinators are in decline and this affects our food sources, https://ento.psu.edu/pollinators/resources-and-outreach/globally-pollinators-are-in-decline If you come across a hive, please don\'t exterminate them, but call the Grant County Extension Service at 575-388-1559, and we\'ll connect you with a Beekeeper like Travis and Bill to relocate them and preserve our local bees!

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:39 pm Funeral homes often submit obituaries as a service to the families they are assisting. However, we will be happy to accept obituaries from family members pending proper verification of the death. Edward Fabian Xiques Jr., 81 years old, of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, passed away on December 4, 2020 in Las Cruces, NM. Ed was born in Staten Island, New York on October 9, 1939 to Edward E. and Helen (MacFarland) Xiques. Ed was a legendary woodwind doubler, composer and improviser, playing all the saxophones, flutes and clarinets. He traveled the world, working with a vast array of musical artists, both famous and obscure, always with the same focus, integrity and compassion. Ed was a beloved and devoted teacher to countless music students who came to his home in Putnam Valley, NY. He'd often go overtime, lend out his personal equipment, attend student concerts... these being but a few examples of his generous spirit. Ed grew up in Pelham Manor, NY. His father, who played saxophone in college, gave him his first soprano sax when he was 9 years old. He carried that sax to school everyday, wrapped in a blanket. He graduated from Pelham High in 1957 and attended Boston University where he met the love of his life, Rosemary Biddy. After putting himself through college, he received a BA in music education in 1962. Ed considered himself a self-taught musician and continued to study music and composition for the rest of his life. Ed’s family was of utmost importance to him. He is survived by his wife, Rosemary; son, Thomas Gregory; grandchildren: Jack Basie and Isabella Rose; as well as his brothers: Pete, Robert, Chris and Brendon; and his sister Helen-Louise. He was preceded in death by his youngest brother, Greg; and his parents, Edward Sr. and Helen. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that you enjoy some music with a loved one and remember to support living artists.

Mexico\'s 2nd Congressional District before Democrats took it from her. Election officials at the county and state level say her claims are false and undermine confidence in the elections. Herrell is seeking the party\'s nomination to challenge U.S. Rep. Xochitl Torres Small, D-NM, for New Mexico District 2 this November. But in 2018, Herrell and Torres Small also vied to replace outgoing Congressman Steve Pearce, who now chairs the state Republican Party. Torres Small eked out a win over Herrell to flip the traditionally Republican district for the Democrats. Although Herrell was declared the early winner, Torres Small emerged victorious when more than 8,500 absentee ballots from Doña Ana County were tabulated and lifted Torres Small to a 3,500-vote victory. Herrell\'s ad claims the absentee ballots ""appeared"" seemingly out of nowhere. In truth, the absentee ballots just hadn\'t been tabulated yet. They were hand counted in public view by a bipartisan team the Wednesday morning after the election. Herrell\'s campaign petitioned to impound and inspect the absentee ballots for irregularities after the results. Her campaign at the time said that they\'d found ""documented complaints"" during the voting process. Herrell\'s campaign chose not to contest the results of the 2018 election, but that didn\'t stop her campaign in a new ad from claiming ""on Election Day, we won, but the Democrats took it away."" The ad, which the Herrell campaign confirmed on Thursday it had paid to boost on Facebook, continues: ""If liberals can\'t beat us, they\'ll cheat us."" Watch the ad below: Herrell\'s campaign hasn\'t offered any evidence to prove the election was stolen, as it alleges, but an audit it commissioned to examine the absentee ballot results after the election claimed it found some irregularities. The resulting attorney\'s report is detailed in a Daily Signal article and highlighted in the ad. Her campaign said in a statement: “The law is clear: absentee ballots must have the voter\'s correct name, birth year, address, and signature. Ballots must also be received before 7 p.m. on Election Day. Yet as our attorney\'s report clearly showed, the law was ignored by Democrats in Doña Ana County."" Absentee ballots use an outer envelope for mailing purposes that holds the sealed ballot within. The outer envelope features a sworn statement that must be signed by a voter, plus it must include the voter\'s name, address and birth year. The audit alleged a few absentee ballots had been accepted despite having missing or incorrect signatures and other identifying information. It also alleges some voters listed on the absentee rolls said they never applied for or received a ballot and 577 absentee ballots were accepted after the 7 p.m. deadline on Election Day. Despite this, the audit\'s author still told the Signal at the time: ""There were not enough irregularities in Doña Ana County alone to alter our race (though local races could have been altered)."" County Clerk Amanda López Askin said her office has and continues to follow the law when it comes to absentee ballots and said ballots are only mailed to people who have verified they are eligible to vote. ""I really find it unfortunate that there is such rampant misinformation,"" Askin said. Askin said New Mexico\'s election system is a ""good system with many checks and balances,"" including hand-marked paper ballots, a bipartisan swath of election officials made up of community members, and servers that are never connected to the internet. The Herrell campaign said if they requested to inspect the other counties\' absentee ballots, ""we are confident that more than enough illegal ballots would have been found to overturn the results."" Answering why the campaign chose not to contest the results when it had the chance, a spokesperson wrote: ""(The campaign) knew a lawsuit to overturn the results would have to be filed in a Doña Ana court that has a history of ignoring election fraud."" The audit points to a higher number of absentee ballots requested in 2018 than in past years — along with a higher percentage of ballots not mailed back when compared with the state average. The 2018 midterms had historically high turnout, and in New Mexico, 57 percent of voters either voted early or by mail — 12th highest in the nation. While the audit attributes the high number of absentee ballot requests to get out the vote efforts by campaigns and nonpartisan groups, it alleges groups applied on behalf of others. Askin said the county only accepts absentee ballot applications initiated by a voter. Herrell\'s campaign said she pushed lawmakers last year to add language to state election law to clarify that ballots cannot be accepted without signatures and other required information on the outer envelope. Then this past election cycle, the Doña Ana County Clerk\'s Office came under fire from the state Republican Party over claims it had still been improperly certifying some absentee ballots that were missing required information, even after the language had been clarified. The state Republican Party sought an injunction in November against the county clerk\'s office and New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver to pause the processing of absentee ballots, but a judge rejected the motion. Alex Curtas, a spokesperson for Toulouse Oliver, said in a statement about the ad: ""Ms. Herrell’s claims are patently false and extremely misleading to voters in CD2. The results of the 2018 election were certified by New Mexico’s bipartisan state canvassing board — which included former Governor Susana Martinez as a member — and no fraud was found in the CD2 race or any other."" ""The claim that absentee ballots ‘appeared’ and changed the outcome of the election is demonstrably false and is exactly the kind of disinformation Secretary Toulouse Oliver and New Mexico’s election administrators work to combat every day. These false claims of voter fraud needlessly undermine confidence in our elections. Always contact election officials for trusted information about elections,"" Curtas wrote. Torres Small\'s campaign declined to comment on the ad when reached, saying questions about county election procedure should be directed to the county clerk. Herrell is running against oil executive Claire Chase and Las Cruces businessman Chris Mathys in the Republican primary.
