RELATED: Walmart, Boeing, Hallmark among companies pulling political contributions after pro-Trump Capitol riot Epstein said that after word of his ads got out, he got mixed reactions, ranging from some people calling him crazy to others relating to his frustrations. ""The one response I got the most kick out of was in the Jewish Daily Forward; referred to me as a 90-year-old ‘kvetch,’ which I don’t know if you know your Yiddish but ‘kvetch’ means crank,"" Epstein said with a chuckle. Epstein said he doesn’t really mind what people think of his action, as long as it gets the job done. The ads ran on Wednesday, Feb. 3 and that same morning, at around 11 a.m., Epstein received a call from a spokesperson who directly represents the president of AT&T. ""Turns out, AT&T has an office in Atlanta that is the office of the president and that’s where they refer big-time complaints,"" Epstein said. The spokesperson took down all of Epstein’s information and said they would see what they could do to help move things along. ""So I am waiting patiently to see what they can do. She says, ""We’ll try to get that happening for you sooner,‘"" Epstein said, beaming. RELATED: Super Bowl streaker arrested after being tackled by quarterback-turned-deputy And while Epstein bankrolled the entire endeavor, he credited the news media for helping him get the attention he believed would invoke change. ""The press that contacted AT&T, that’s where the squeaks are heard... So I appreciate the press,"" he added. Epstein has yet to see the familiar AT&T trucks moving into his neighborhood to start laying down fiber optic cables, but he is remaining optimistic. According to AT&T’s fiber optics map, several areas in Los Angeles have received a green mark, symbolizing that those residents have access to faster internet speeds. Cities that are ""in progress"" are symbolized with a blue mark, according to the map legend. RELATED: Mysterious monolith pops up near Turkish World Heritage site Epstein’s neighborhood had not yet received an ""in progress"" mark as of Feb. 9, according to the website. AT&T said in a statement that the company is continuing to enhance and invest in their wireless services and networks and have already spent $3.1 billion in the Los Angeles-area as of 2019, but did not comment on the progress on Epstein’s specific issue.

The special coverage in Austin focused on the city’s growth. KXAN reporter Tahera Rahman joined Holt to discuss Austin’s tech industry boom. News anchors Robert Hadlock and Britt Moreno discussed the importance of journalism with Holt in an interview that aired on KXAN News. They touched on how the pandemic changed local and national newscasts alike. “Advanced technology allowed us to broadcast from home,” Holt said. “I did Nightly News — a lot of people don’t know this — from the spare bedroom in my home for about a year.” “There was one day I knew I hit rock bottom. I looked down, I realized I was anchoring Nightly News barefoot,” Holt laughed. “It just somehow felt wrong.” Hadlock asked Holt what moment or event in his career has impacted him the most. Holt recalled the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He says he came away from that experience seeing how the world can band together during dark times. “I remember thinking, man, if we could somehow corral this kind of response to bad things happening in the world, where everybody was on the same team, that would make my job more enjoyable,” Holt said. When asked what stands out about Austin, Holt said, “I think it’s the content-ness” people have with the city. “It also seems a city that people are kind of craving, what’s the next thing, what’s the new thing, and how do we embrace it and make it work for us,” Holt said. Holt will also be reporting from the ground in St. Louis, Washington, D.C., Nashville and Phoenix. The series will take an in-depth look at how the pandemic has impacted the cities’ real estate markets, school structures, crime rates and political systems. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

When the ambulance arrived, Maisy went into anaphylactic shock and her body began shutting down on the way to the hospital, according to Spell. “We got to the hospital, they were trying to reassure us she was going to be OK, but she just did not look anything OK at all. She was pale, vitals were immediately going down very fast. A very scary situation,” Spell said. The girl’s lungs started closing up when she arrived at South Georgia Medical Center, and her heart rate and blood pressure dropped. Doctors intubated Maisy and she was life-flighted to Shands Hospital. Her mom said she has received up to 37 vials of anti-venom. Doctors are working to save the young girl’s leg. Spell said the venom appears to be spreading to her thigh. “I’ve never in my life experienced anything like it. Just pray. I mean, people ask us what can we do for you and really her body and the doctors have to do the rest,” Spell said. Copyright 2021 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.

The COVID-19 pandemic has dominated headlines this year in the San Antonio area, but there were several other stories that caught the attention of KSAT.com readers. Recommended Videos From the winter storm and the Astroworld tragedy to new Texas laws and trash diving in the River Walk, these are the stories y’all read most this year. 1. YouTuber gets city’s blessing to dive along San Antonio River Walk after police stop first attempt A popular diver on YouTube returned to San Antonio this year to dredge “treasures” from the San Antonio River legally after getting stopped by police for attempting it in 2020. Brandon Jordan is an outdoorsman who has attracted a YouTube following with nearly three million subscribers. His dives into the San Antonio River were so successful, he created two videos about his adventures. Read more about what Jordan found in the depths of the river here. 2. Family shocked to find float covered in invasive Zebra mussels at Lake LBJ There are more than two dozen lakes in Texas that are classified as being infested with an invasive species known as zebra mussels, including Lake Lyndon B. Johnson. In July, a homeowner in the Kingsland area shared a photo to social media showing a float her family keeps in the water at Lake LBJ that’s completely covered in zebra mussels. You can read more and check out the photo here! 3. Nine new laws that take effect Sept. 1 in Texas A total of 666 new laws went into effect on Sept. 1 in Texas. Some major law changes were inspired by the coronavirus pandemic and February’s winter storm while others were related to guns, abortion, body-worn cameras, education and the use of medicinal marijuana. We broke down the nine new laws that received the most attention here. 4. Yes, Ted Cruz flew to Cancun during Texas’ winter disaster KSAT.com was the first news outlet to report on the photos circulating on Twitter that appeared to show Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on his way to Cancun, Mexico, during the state’s historic and deadly disaster in February. Cruz would later confirm he flew to Cancun and returned a day later. The senator was blasted for leaving the state he represents in Congress for a tropical paradise amid a historic power and water crisis that affected nearly every Texan. In an interview with ABC News, Cruz said he took the trip with his two daughters and his wife, who wanted to get out of the cold weather for the weekend. Read more here. 5. This is what happened at the Travis Scott concert and everything we know so far about Astroworld Ten people died and dozens were injured during a chaotic night at a Travis Scott concert called Astroworld. An estimated 50,000 people were in attendance at the Houston festival in November. A crowd surge at the start of Scott’s show trapped dozens of concert-goers leading to deaths and injuries. Three San Antonio families are suing Scott after the deadly event. You can read more here. 6. Social media video shows brawl between Spurs and Rockets fans in Houston The I-10 rivalry between the Spurs and Rockets got a little heated in the stands in February when social media videos showed a brawl between opposing-team fans. The fight broke out in the stands during a game with multiple people involved. It’s unclear what led to the incident and if anyone was injured. You can read more and see the videos here. 7. Officer shoots “active shooter” at San Antonio airport, chief says A San Antonio park police officer shot a man who opened fire at the airport in April. Police chief William McManus said the suspect, later identified as Joe Gomez, 46, was seen driving the wrong way in the airport’s Terminal B. Gomez had opened fire from a highway ramp earlier in the afternoon before making his way to the airport. The park police officer confronted the man who immediately got out of his car and opened fire at the officer and the building. The officer returned fire, hitting Gomez twice. Moments later, Gomez turned the gun on himself. An autopsy from the Bexar County Medical Examiner revealed that Gomez fatal gunshot wound was self-inflicted. No one else was injured. You can read more about this incident here. 8. ERCOT initiates rolling outages during winter storm In the midst of the devastating winter storm, ERCOT, the state’s power grid operator, initiated rolling power outages in the early Monday morning hours of Feb. 15 to protect and reduce demand on the state’s electric grid. That left millions of Texans literally in the dark and cold for long amounts of time with temperatures dropping throughout the week. ERCOT directed local utilities to begin restoring power to thousands of Texans Tuesday afternoon, but many were still left without power for days. Read more here. 9. Teen arrested after Snapchat video shows her stealing necklace from dead man, BCSO says A teenager was arrested after Bexar County sheriff’s deputies said she was seen on a Snapchat video in July stealing a necklace from the body of a man who committed suicide. An arrest warrant affidavit stated that Bethany Martin, 17, and a female friend, 16, discovered the man’s body in Southwest Bexar County. One video showed Martin and her friend near the man’s body, and another video showed Martin removing a chain and medallion from his neck, according to the affidavit. You can read more about this arrest here. 10. Were your plants damaged by the freeze? Here’s what to do next. While many of us had more pressing issues during the February deep freeze, there was a significant toll on landscaping.

""The Republican Party turned their back on them,” James Davis, organizer of the MAGA Patriot Party National Committee said. Davis, a 57-year-old government worker, is a lifelong Republican from Florida, who left the party after the 2020 Election over the treatment of the former president. ""Those people who fought against him,” he described. “Those that voted to impeach him."" The MAGA Patriot Party has groups in all 50 states. Texas is the fastest growing with 450 members. There’s about 12,000 nationwide, according to Davis. The Federal Election Commission on Monday posted a notice of organization on behalf of the ""MAGA Patriot Party"" headquartered in San Antonio, Texas. According to documents, the committee fundraises exclusively for the ""Donald J. Trump for President"" political action committee. Davis said he’s been in the process of reaching out to the Trump Family and Trump Campaign about the committee. Former President Trump has toyed with the idea of forming a third party but has not endorsed them. ""The people who are joining us, the people who are conservatives, the people who feel like they\'re being censored, they want to do something and it\'s not all going to rest on one man,” Davis told Fox San Antonio’s Ryan Wolf. Their goals include elevating candidates in local and state campaigns to ultimately earn political leverage as a swing party. Davis said he feels there\'s enough defectors from the 74 million plus people who voted for Trump to rapidly grow as a viable party in the years to come. ""Transparency,” he told Wolf about the committee. “Making people feel like they can trust our system. And, make them feel like they can trust the representatives given by us."" “Is this trust in the election process?” Wolf asked. “Was this started because you feel the election was stolen from Former President Trump, which are words he has mentioned himself? Or is this more about the treatment of the president, and fellow Republicans who turned their backs on him? Is this movement to reinvigorate those who feel like they\'re left out?” “I think it\'s a good mixture of all those things,"" Davis replied.
