Support our independent, nonprofit newsroom today. The $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit filed against Fox News over lies about the 2020 election has brought shocking revelations to light. Among those who say they aren\'t shocked: former journalists at Fox News, who suggest that maybe the public now better understands what they saw from the inside. ""I was not particularly surprised,"" former Fox politics director Chris Stirewalt says. ""There\'s not one thing that surprised me or struck me,"" says former Fox commentator and guest host Julie Roginsky. ""And I\'ve read everything in those filings."" Private exchanges and sworn testimony secured by Dominion Voting System\'s legal team show that Fox News\' producers, stars and executives put people on the air that they thought were ""nuts"" to spin bogus claims that the election-tech company cheated then-President Donald Trump of victory by switching votes to Joe Biden. Former Fox chief political correspondent Carl Cameron says one element stood out. ""I\'m surprised that there weren\'t more people who would speak out,"" Cameron says. Cameron left Fox about seven months into the Trump administration — after 21 years at the network. He later said ""right wing hosts drowned out straight journalism"" at the channel. \'There was a time when the journalists had some control. That clearly has eroded\' ""There was a time when the journalists had some control,"" Cameron says now. ""And that clearly has eroded. And exactly when that started ... really doesn\'t matter. What it ended up with, is the organization has a serious legal problem. "" Each of them point in some ways to the 2016 departure of the late Roger Ailes — the celebrated, reviled and ultimately disgraced former Fox News chief. ""With the absence of Roger Ailes, the mentality that no one was going to be bigger than the network had disappeared,"" Roginsky says. To be clear on Roginsky\'s feelings about Ailes, she was one of many women at Fox News who alleged he sexually harassed her. She sued Fox and Ailes and received an undisclosed settlement. Fox News says CEO Suzanne Scott has completely reshaped the network\'s culture since the Ailes era. Despite all that, Roginsky says Ailes enforced an intense discipline at Fox that vanished, right as Trump won the nomination and headed to the White House. Over the Trump years, many journalists left Fox, including Cameron, anchor Shepard Smith and others. \'They were going to be led by the mob\' ""The people who stayed — by the very nature of being allowed to stay — had to accept the notion that they were going to be led by the mob and the mob was being led by Donald Trump,"" Roginsky says. Not every Fox alumnus agrees. Former primetime star Bill O\'Reilly, whom the network forced out in 2017 after his own sexual harassment scandal, says the rest of the media makes too much of the story. The network will keep its core audience of older conservative viewers,"" he wrote recently. ""They will stand by their men and women, having nowhere else to go."" No one stood in the crucible more squarely than Chris Stirewalt. He was Fox\'s political director in 2020, part of the Decision Desk team on election night that called the swing state of Arizona for Biden. Fox did so ahead of any other network, angering millions of Trump supporters who were Fox viewers. Stirewalt and Washington Managing Editor Bill Sammon argued that the network needed to level with their viewers. The private exchanges that arose from the lawsuit show many of Fox\'s opinion hosts and executives instead decided to broadcast claims of fraud, knowing they were baseless, in an effort to woo back the Trump voters Fox had alienated. ""What you read in those filings are people losing their heads because of ratings numbers,"" Stirewalt says. ""And one of the emails that was released was from Bill to me, where he talked about how weak ratings make good journalists do bad things. And that\'s a fact."" Two top political editors forced out after election ""It was particularly sad for an organization that had used to call itself \'the most powerful name in news\' that it was such a fear-driven, such an anxious thing,"" Stirewalt says. He cites ""the unwillingness to suffer the short-term cost for the long-term good, and, if I can be especially corny, the good of the Republic."" Before Biden even took office, Fox forced out Stirewalt and Sammon, along with a host of other journalists from the newsroom. (A top Fox News PR executive said ""Chris Stirewalt\'s quest for relevancy knows no bounds."") Stirewalt is now the political director for the new cable station News Nation. Fox executives turned over popular time slots that used to be reserved for news coverage to opinion shows at 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. In late 2021, Fox political commentators Stephen Hayes and Jonah Goldberg and Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace all left the network. Each cited Fox primetime star Tucker Carlson\'s programs promoting groundless conspiracy theories about the January 2021 siege of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters. Fox has called the exchanges made public in the legal saga cherry-picked and out of context. There are hundreds more to come in the days ahead. The case is slated for trial next month.

The funding is being awarded through the Recompete Pilot Program, a new law authored by Rep. Kilmer, which aims to alleviate persistent economic distress and support long-term, comprehensive economic development and job creation. EDA awarded a $500,000 Strategy Development Grant to the Washington State Coastal Counties Initiative – an initiative being led by Greater Grays Harbor, Inc for Grays Harbor and Pacific counties. The Strategy Development Grant is focused on reducing the prime age employment gap, according to Kilmer, and will assist the initiative as it aims to undertake a “bottom-up, equitable strategy to create jobs, remove economic barriers, and ensure inclusive growth for historically marginalized communities on Washington state’s Pacific Coast”. EDA also awarded a $500,000 Strategy Development Grant to the North Olympic Peninsula Recompete Coalition (NOPRC) – and named it a national finalist for an Implementation Grant. The NOPRC, a new coalition of members from both Clallam and Jefferson Counties, as well as area Tribes, is crafting an economic initiative that aims to help the legacy timber and maritime industries evolve, while preparing students for living wages and in-demand jobs in those industries. The Strategy Development Grant awarded by EDA will facilitate the NOPRC’s initiatives to boost job creation, enhance workforce development, and improve access to support services. Through partnerships with key educational institutions such as Peninsula College and the Northwest School of Wooden Boatbuilding, the coalition aims to provide specialized training opportunities that align with the labor needs of the local maritime and timber businesses. The NOPRC is one of 22 national finalists for a Phase 2 Implementation Grant, which could see the coalition awarded between $20 and $50 million to execute the proposal. The Recompete Pilot Program was established by Rep. Kilmer’s Rebuilding Economies and Creating Opportunities for More People Everywhere to Excel Act (RECOMPETE Act), which is a part of the larger CHIPS and Science Act signed by President Biden in July 2022. The Recompete Pilot Program aims to support local economic development, create quality jobs, invest in workers and businesses, and ensure sustainable success and economic growth nationwide. “I grew up in Port Angeles and was in high school right around the time the timber industry took it on the chin,” said Rep. Kilmer. “I saw a lot of my friends’ parents lose their jobs. It had a big impact on me. My journey in public service has been dedicated to one core mission: ensuring that we do a better job of safeguarding workers and communities. That means building an economy where no one is left behind. Now, seeing the RECOMPETE Act – an idea I’ve championed for years – come to fruition with this inaugural grant gives some real cause for hope. The Recompete Pilot Program is focused on providing economic opportunities for folks on the Olympic Peninsula, the Pacific Coast, and nationwide. It’s about making sure that everyone, no matter their zip code, has access to these opportunities.” “This funding is great news for the Olympic Peninsula as they move forward with this process,” said U.S. Senator Patty Murray. “Bringing the Recompete funding home to the peninsula would be a game changer for our communities and this initial award is a big step in the right direction. This is about making sure every part of Washington state can count on good paying jobs and see real economic opportunity. I want to commend Congressman Kilmer especially for leading the way to make this grant program a reality.” “These awards will help people on the Olympic Peninsula develop innovative new ways to tap into their natural resources and modernize their maritime and timber industries to ultimately increase the number of stable and high-paying jobs in the region,” said U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell. “Today’s announcement also means that the Olympic Peninsula is now one of 22 communities eligible to compete for up to $50 million in federal funding to implement their new economic development plan. Washington is an innovation state, but we didn’t become a powerhouse overnight – we built our workforce and grew our collaborative partnerships over decades. Programs like Recompete will help us continue that growth by tapping into the talent, expertise, and innovation throughout the state.” Phase 1 of the Recompete Pilot Program will invest in persistently distressed communities to create and connect people to good jobs. This program will create renewed economic opportunity in communities that have for too long been forgotten. To do so, the program targets areas where prime-age (25-54 years) employment significantly trails the national average to close this gap through large, flexible investments. As part of the U.S. Economic Development Administration’s place-based economic development approach, the Recompete Pilot Program aims to meet communities where they are by offering grant opportunities that ensure sustainable and equitable economic growth across the U.S. Recompete Finalists will compete in Phase 2 of the competition, with 4-8 Recompete Plans ultimately receiving implementation funding averaging between $20 and $50 million. The Recompete Pilot Program was adopted into the CHIPS and Science Act, led by Sen. Cantwell. In October 2022, Rep. Kilmer wrote to U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development Alejandra Y. Castillo in strong support of the NOPRC’s application and the Washington State Coastal Counties Initiative’s application to Phase 1 of the Recompete Pilot Program.
