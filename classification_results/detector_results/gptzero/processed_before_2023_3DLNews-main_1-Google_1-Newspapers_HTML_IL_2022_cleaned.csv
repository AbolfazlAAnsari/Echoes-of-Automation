J.B. Pritzker called patient abuses at the Choate Mental Health and Developmental Center in rural Anna “awful” and “deeply concerning,” and he said the future of the facility depends on correcting poor conditions. Pritzker’s comments at a news conference on Tuesday came on the heels of articles published Friday by Capitol News Illinois, Lee Enterprises and ProPublica outlining a history of egregious patient abuses and other employee misconduct at Choate. At least 26 employees over the past decade have been arrested on felony charges in relation to their work at the facility, and internal investigations have cited dozens of other employees for neglecting, exploiting or humiliating residents, lying to investigators, or failing to report allegations of mistreatment in a timely manner. In some cases, investigations have languished for years as accused employees have continued to receive their full pay while on administrative leave. At least one advocacy organization called for the state to close Choate in the wake of the reports. Amie Lulinski, executive director of The Arc of Illinois, an advocacy organization for people with developmental disabilities, said the details of abuse and neglect are “appalling” and called on the state to move residents out of the facility and into smaller community-based living arrangements such as group homes. Pritzker said the state isn’t currently planning to close Choate, but he didn’t rule it out if safety issues aren’t addressed. “The question is, can we prevent that in the future? And if not, then obviously that’s not a facility that should remain open,” the governor said in response to a reporter’s questions at an unrelated event in downstate Decatur. Meanwhile, he said, the “state has an obligation to the people that it serves at that facility right now” and is concentrating on upgrades to the facility and ensuring that appropriate services and personnel are in place. In a statement to reporters last week, Marisa Kollias, a spokesperson for the Illinois Department of Human Services, which runs Choate, said that the problems there are the result of “longstanding, entrenched issues” and that the department has taken “aggressive measures” to address them. The push to close facilities like Choate is controversial, and some residents’ parents are advocating for less severe measures to address safety concerns. In 2017, a Choate employee was arrested on a felony battery charge and later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery for punching Rita Burke’s son in the abdomen, breaking two of his ribs. But Burke, who is the president of Friends of Choate, an organization that represents parents, guardians and other supporters, said the fact that the employee was swiftly removed from patient care and prosecuted is a sign that the facility takes cases of abuse seriously. After researching their options nationwide, Burke said, she and her husband relocated from Georgia to Illinois over 30 years ago to place their son at Choate. At the time, Georgia offered extremely limited support for adults with disabilities, she said. She feels that her son, who is intellectually disabled and has a severe behavior disorder, is better off at Choate than he would be in a privately operated small group home. Abuses, she said, unfortunately happen at facilities of all sizes across the country. “Our belief is our facility is working to make it safe and to get rid of people who are a danger to our individuals,” she said. “We couldn’t be more in sync with them on that score.” State Sen. Jil Tracy, R-Quincy, agrees that the facility shouldn’t be closed. Her 55-year-old brother lives at Choate. He has profound autism and diabetes that requires constant monitoring. If left unchecked, his blood sugar levels could cause him to have behavioral outbursts, get sick or even die. Tracy’s brother has tried living in group homes, but his health problems coupled with his autism have made those places a bad fit. At Choate, he gets the close monitoring that he needs and Tracy’s 94-year-old mother, who is his legal guardian, can visit often, Tracy said. “Yes, there have been horrible instances there, but Choate provides a niche in care,” Tracy said. “Changes do need to be made because these facilities are absolutely necessary, but we need to make them as safe as possible and as nice as possible.” Choate, a 270-bed facility on the outskirts of Anna, about 120 miles southeast of St. Louis, serves people from across Illinois with intellectual and developmental disabilities, mental illnesses or a combination of disorders. Patients can enter voluntarily or be placed there by a guardian, or a judge may order them to Choate for treatment after finding they’re at risk of harming themselves or others. Choate also houses Illinois’ only forensic unit for people with developmental disabilities found unfit to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity in criminal proceedings. The IDHS Office of the Inspector General, which investigates employee misconduct, looked into 1,500 allegations at Choate over a 10 year period ending in 2021. That’s more than at any other facility in the state. Of those, 800 involved physical abuse, 600 involved mental abuse and 100 involved sexual abuse. The inspector general substantiated the allegations in about 5% of the claims, in line with other facilities. But the number of allegations per year has increased, and Choate has faced repeated criticism from the inspector general, the local prosecutor and state police for employees interfering or attempting to derail investigations into wrongdoing. State Sen. Terri Bryant, R-Murphysboro, whose district includes Choate, blamed some of the issues at the facility on broader failures of the state of Illinois. It can take months for job applicants to navigate the state’s bureaucratic hiring process, and by the time an offer is made, “sometimes what you’re left with is the folks that couldn’t get a job anywhere else,” she said. The OIG is woefully understaffed, she added, resulting in dozens of employees accused of abuse or neglect unable to work their regular duties for months or years until investigations into their actions are closed and they’re either fired or cleared to return to patient care. “The (OIG) does not have enough investigators,” she said. “It’s inexcusable.” In a statement, the OIG said it intends to augment its investigative efforts, specifically looking at the root causes of abuse and neglect at IDHS facilities. The OIG will also identify and address programmatic or systemic concerns needed at a facility. Even when the OIG has recommended changes at Choate, they have often been slow to happen, if they happen at all. The office recommended that cameras be installed at Choate 21 times over the last six years, internal records show. In response to mounting calls to address safety concerns at Choate, IDHS announced in June that it would install 10 cameras, though later the department clarified they would go outside the facility. Senior IDHS officials told reporters that they raised the idea of placing them inside in common areas such as hallways and group rooms, but that some parents and guardians rejected the idea, citing privacy concerns. The news organizations’ reports included emails from the former security chief of Choate seeking to bring troubling conditions to IDHS Secretary Grace Hou’s attention over a year ago. Barry Smoot, who retired in December, asked for a meeting, and Hou initially agreed, but one was never scheduled. Smoot said in a later interview that he felt his concerns were blown off, and that he was troubled by the department’s slow response. Pritzker said on Tuesday he couldn’t speak to how quickly Hou acted to address concerns at Choate. “I will say that speaking up and speaking out, when you see something that’s wrong, is exactly the right thing to do,” he said. “Making sure that there’s responsive people on the other end, and that again, we have transparency and investigations that take place — that’s the right thing to do, and that’s what we’re going to make sure happens.” Kollias, the IDHS spokesperson, previously said that the agency determined, “based on information gathered” after the secretary’s initial response to Smoot, “that it was inadvisable for IDHS management staff to communicate with him any further.” The department did not provide more details.

family-friendly Village of Glenview, Jill Ruschli Crane would hear stories about how different life was in the town in the 1920s and ’30s. Crane shares Glenview’s history during those years in her new, thoroughly-researched book, “Glenview Prohibition: Bootleggers & Boondoggles” (The History Press, 2022).“I don’t think a lot of people were happy about me writing about this particular topic,” Crane said. But the author said that she understood why speak-easies and saloons began filling Glenview during that time period, when it was a small farming town.“They were very, very difficult times and money was really short,” Crane explained. “Any way people could make a living, they did it. One of the best ways to make a lot of money was to have something to do with liquor. They were really good people in impossible situations.”Crane noted that she originally learned of Glenview’s Prohibition history by listening to stories told by her mother, who also grew up in Glenview.“I was young enough to realize that it was a taboo topic,” Crane recalled. Some of the stories the author recalled were based on her grandmother. Jill Ruschli Crane, author of “Glenview Prohibition: Bootleggers & Boondoggles”“My grandmother was not your baking cookies grandmother,” Crane said. “She spent a lot of time at the original Hackney’s, which was called the Lake Avenue Tavern, and became very good friends with the owners. That was one of the first places that opened during early Prohibition. She thought gangsters were pretty cool.”So cool, Crane related, that her mother was allowed to sit on the knee of gangster Bugs Moran at Hackney’s.The author also learned that her grandfather was a bootlegger. “When you were born after 1950 or 1960, bootleggers were like you saw in the movies, wearing fancy suits and all that,” Crane related. “In the small towns, it wasn’t that at all. If somebody had a truck, they could make a lot of money by delivering the beer or other liquor.”In recent years, Crane noted, she became especially close with her mother and began hearing more and more stories about Prohibition life in Glenview.

One man resisted and he was shot to death. The other people were robbed.“They found out much later that killer was Baby Face Nelson,” Crane said. Her book reveals that the gangster died in a shootout in Barrington.The process of researching and writing her book took Crane about two years.Despite the arduous research process, Crane was determined to complete her project.“I think people in Glenview need to know that these people who ran the bars were not these terrible bootlegger-types carrying guns and driving their big cars,” Crane explained. “They were normal people that were just trying to make a living.”This is the first book Crane has written.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 6:59 pm Holiday gifts brighten yearly. Think back a decade, before OLED TVs and LED lights inexpensively illuminated your holidays. While iPhones remain expensive, full-featured, high-performance, near-flagship Android smartphones cost less than $400. Headlines may rant about inflation, but the cost of electronics deflates. Then, again, you can’t eat silicon chips. While buying entertainment devices declines, the cost of the actual entertainment rises. All of the major streaming services increased prices this past year and/or added advertising to the mix. Rather than rehashing prevailing opinions, you can easily find honest reviews of the latest electronics at the following websites: pcmag.com, ars technica.com, wired.com, cnet.com, nytimes.com/wirecutter, reviewed.com and soundand visionmag.com. A few of these require a low-cost subscription after a limited number of free views. They make their profits not from biased reviews, but from the links to websites from which to buy the gear and installing tracking cookies on your phone or computer for advertising purposes. The untrustworthy reviews are the star ratings on Amazon and similar online merchants. While Amazon makes some attempt to police corrupt reviews, it’s akin to police concentrating on bicycle thefts. Headphones make the ideal holiday gift. Prices range from $100 to $700 for quality noise-canceling versions, both in-ear (earbuds) and over-the-ear. Bose, the innovator of the category, now dukes it out with Anker, Apple/Beats, Bowers & Wilkens, JBL, Sony and a few others. The sweet spot for highest performance at a more-or-less affordable price is the $250-$350 range. For over-the-ear phones, you can find the excellent Bose QuietComfort 45 for as little as $249 and the similar Sony WH-1000XM4 for $228. The new model, the WH-1000XM5, is $348. Or, if you demand the absolute best, choose the new Bowers & Wilkens Px8 for $699. Headphones fit nearly every head and work with any recent model audio/video product from A/V receivers and TVs to tablets and smartphones. Even better, you can easily gift-wrap them, since manufacturers package them in a small, usually square box. When Bose loaned me its first noise-canceling headphones over three decades ago, I was the only one in the airplane cabin with this sanity-saving device. Now, many, if not most, passengers wear noise-canceling headphones. A couple of months ago, I recommended upgrades that provide new life and better performance for aging computers. A few readers attempted to take me up on the suggestion only to find that although new solid-state hard drives and memory modules are inexpensive, installing them in your computer presents a formidable challenge. Would you install new spark plugs in cars? I privately recommended a few computer businesses with which I had satisfactorily done business in the past.

It will head to Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who praised its passage in a statement after the House vote. Illinois has long been home to some of the most understaffed nursing homes in the country, a problem that was magnified during the COVID-19 pandemic when long-term care facilities became major centers of transmission. The Illinois Department of Public Health estimates that nearly 8,000 nursing home residents and 100 staff members have died of the disease since the pandemic began. That’s roughly 24 percent of all the COVID-19-related deaths recorded in Illinois as of Wednesday. Op-ed: Nursing home residents, caregivers, and advocates demand overdue reform Officials from the Department of Healthcare and Family Services, which administers Medicaid, have said much of that was due to understaffing and poor quality of care in Medicaid-funded facilities, especially in those that serve low-income residents and people of color, where residents are often housed together. “Imagine ourselves in the year or two prior to COVID, and if we had known it was coming, whether we would have considered resident safety, room crowding, and staffing to have been urgent issues,” HFS Deputy Director Andy Allison told a legislative committee in October. “We lost – this is hard for me – thousands in our nursing homes. I don\'t think there\'s anyone in the country who would not at that point have said, this is urgent. And I think the point is nothing has changed, except that now we know just how bad it can be.” Since around the time the pandemic first struck, HFS has been working on a new funding model that would reward nursing homes for increasing staff levels and provide additional money to raise wages for certified nursing assistants, the people who provide the most day-to-day direct care to residents. That new system, known as a Patient Driven Payment Model, or PDPM, has been the subject of intense negotiations for the past two years between state agencies, senior citizen advocates and the nursing home industry. But House Majority Leader Greg Harris, D-Chicago, announced Wednesday morning that an agreement had finally been reached, and it passed the Senate unanimously later that evening. “It\'s a big victory, and it will bring a lot more accountability to the long-term care industry,” Harris said during a Statehouse news conference. More: Pritzker honors 100 years of Illinois State Police as crime remains campaign flashpoint Most of the funding for the plan, an estimated $515 million, would come from an increased bed tax the state levies on nursing facilities to generate money that is then used to draw down additional federal Medicaid matching funds. Of that, $360 million would be used as incentive payments for nursing homes to increase their staffing levels up to or beyond certain target levels. Those targets are determined by what’s known as the Staff Time and Resource Intensity Verification, or STRIVE study of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Those incentive payments begin when a facility reaches 75 percent of its STRIVE target and increase incrementally with each full percentage point increase that a facility attains, up to a maximum of $38.68 per patient day. Another $85 million would be used to subsidize annual wage hikes for CNAs based on their years of experience. Those would start with a $1.50 per-hour bump for those with one year of experience, increasing annually to a maximum of $6.50 per hour for those with at least six years of experience. Another $70 million would be used to reward facilities that demonstrate improvement on certain quality measures. The bill also calls for spending another $202 million in combined state and federal funds to raise the base per-day reimbursement rate the state pays nursing homes by $7, bringing it to $92.25 per resident day, plus another $4 per day for facilities serving an above-average percentage of Medicaid patients. Additionally, the bill requires nursing facility owners to report annually the names of all individuals and organizations with an ownership interest in the facility, a change prompted by the growing number of facilities owned by private equity funds, a trend that some studies have suggested is linked to lower quality care. One provision the nursing home industry negotiated into the bill is an 18-month phase-in period during which all facilities would be reimbursed as if they were at 85 percent of their STRIVE target. The new payment system is spelled out in a Senate amendment to House Bill 246. It passed out of the Senate on Wednesday, 58-0, and the House on Thursday 113-0. “For 45,000 vulnerable seniors in nursing homes across the state, the passage of HB 246 will mean improved care and accountability in the places they call home,"" Pritzker said in a statement. ""For the first time, increased funding for nursing homes will be tied to staffing levels at these facilities, ensuring new funds go directly to improving care for our seniors instead of profit for owners and allowing us to hold bad actors accountable. This legislation is the product of more than a year of hard work led by my Department of Healthcare and Family Services along with our partners in the General Assembly, stakeholders, and industry leaders.

During the July Germantown Hills Chamber of Commerce meeting, they recognized their two recent scholarship winners from the Class of 2022 at Metamora Township High School. The winners are Jacob Nelan, son of Mark and Bridget Nelan of Germantown Hills; and Ryan J. Russell, son of Shane and Julie Russell also of Germantown Hills. These young men will each receive a $500 scholarship to help offset their fall tuition at their respective colleges. Jake’s future plans are to attend Bradley University and pursue the field of engineering and business. He will be in the honors program at Bradley and looks to gain experience in leadership roles with several organizations at Bradley as he has an eye on starting his own construction business in the future. Ryan has already ventured into the business world by starting “Magic with Ryan” back in the eighth grade. This led him to running for several years a not-for-profit haunted house in his backyard with proceeds of over $5,200 going to St. Jude. He plans to attend Illinois State University this fall with his eye on owning a business in his future. The Chamber would like to congratulate both of these young men and wish them well with their future pursuits. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

From time to time that expectation is not what we expected it should be. During this last year several individuals believed to be acting in the public’s best interest have come under scrutiny. Joliet Township has two elected officials who seem to demonstrate they are not obligated to follow the rules of government. For instance, Joliet Township Trustee Karl Ferrell has been technically removed from his seat on the township board by court order because he is ineligible due to his status as a felon. He has managed to delay his removal until October when a hearing on the matter is scheduled with the Illinois Prisoner Review Board. If his status as a felon changes, the issue becomes moot and goes away. Joliet Township Supervisor, Angel Contreras is facing several felony charges, the latest being a DUI he received last June 19th in Joliet. The position he holds on the Township board administers the General Assistance program and he is also treasurer of all Township funds among other responsibilities. In other words, he holds a position of trust and responsibility. As is the case with most public officials, character matters. Whether Contreras is able to hold on to his elected office is yet to be determined. The most recent demonstration of responsibility and character among local officials occurred with current Joliet City Councilman Pat Mudron. He claimed ignorance of the requirement to disclose his insurance business contracts with the Rialto Theatre and the Joliet Historical Museum. Mudron serves on City Council Committees for Diversity & Community Relations, Finance, and Joliet’s baseball stadium. He also serves as the liaison to the Rialto Theatre. The City of Joliet provides financial assistance to the Rialto. He never disclosed his business relationships, as required annually, on his Illinois’ ethics disclosure form. He has been replaced in that role by Mayor Bob O’Dekirk. Apparently, soliciting and doing the insurance business is not a problem but not revealing the conflict of interest is a problem and deemed unethical. Another party to that same unethical transaction is the CEO of the Rialto board. He never asked for a vote from the board to change to an insurance carrier represented by Mudron. Since it is a public body subject to the Illinois Open Meetings Act, (OMA) the board is required to make all votes at a public meeting as a requirement of the OMA. It’s not an egregious violation but it could negate the transaction until it is made public. Again, it is a violation of trust in a public official. Given the nature of the transaction, it does raise another question. Since all of the transaction was held without public disclosure, was there any loss of coverage or change in the policy? Price is not necessarily the best barometer of an insurance policy’s value. The Rialto is an older structure and does not possess the safety of fire suppression water sprinklers. That was one of the reasons the former insurance carrier raised the insurance premium, according to published reports. Perhaps weather damage could also occur that could cause loss of all or a partial loss of the structure. Could it be restored to its present beauty under the new coverage? Character, or lack thereof, often plays a valuable role in our public officials. Following the rules usually ensures things will be done correctly. It also instills public trust of those charged with the responsibilities of office. We should always expect a high standard of integrity and accountability of our public officials. Character does matter. One last thing… a local news story published this last week caught my attention. It was about a photographer’s exhibit at St Joe’s hospital. One of the photograph’s has actually been displayed in one of the hospital’s hallways for several years. Prior to its display at Ascension St. Joseph hospital, it also hung for several years in the lobby entrance to the well-known Al’s Steakhouse on West Jefferson Street. The framed picture was taken by photographer Bob Campbell for what was intended to be a posed picture setting for a family Christmas gift. It was dinnertime and the children in the photo had been less than patient waiting for the camera to do its work. It became obvious the battle for calm had been lost and Campbell decided to snap the picture of the children as they were impatiently waiting to be “posed.”. The photo captures the almost visible thoughts of the group. Why do I know this? Those six children are mine and my wife’s grandchildren. It’s a great reminder of a wonderful time shared and I hope a gift of innocence to be shared with others. It’s many years later now and four of the six are over 21, one is 19 this month and the other will be 19 next month. It’s a wonderful memory. Thanks, Bob.

'Riverside-Brookfield Landmark A hyperlocal news site committed to in-depth reporting on issues concerning Riverside, North Riverside and Brookfield, Illinois. Riverside police charged a 35-year-old Willowbrook man with driving under the influence of drugs after he drove his Hyundai Santa Fe off the roadway, over some shrubs and onto the driveway of a home in the 600 block of Selborne Road, crashing into the closed overhead garage door at about 2:50 a.m. on Nov. 11. When officers arrived, the car was still running and occupied by the driver and two others — his 36-year-old brother and 67-year-old mother. The driver did not respond to commands, police said, and later told them he didn’t know where he was. The man’s brother was slouched over and unresponsive in the back seat. The mother reportedly told police her son was sick and that they’d been trying to find a doctor since 8:30 p.m. the previous day. Both men were taken to the hospital for treatment and observation. Police later charged the driver with DUI after administering field sobriety tests. A 22-year-old Lyons man whose box truck was reportedly stolen from a lot at 9100 Plainfield Ave., Brookfield, sometime after 11 a.m. on Nov. 12 called police during the early morning hours of Nov. 13 to report the truck had been recovered. The victim told police he wasn’t aware of the theft until he received a call from Summit police at 12:48 a.m. on Nov. 13 that they’d found his truck at a crime scene in the 7800 block of 60th Place, which was also a truck parking lot. The victim told police he learned that someone had hot-wired his truck and drove it off the Brookfield lot. He said he was in the process of recovering security video from the Brookfield location to see if the theft was caught on camera. North Riverside police responded to the 2200 block of 18th Avenue on Nov. 8 after a resident called to report that her unlocked vehicle had been burglarized the prior evening. According to police, surveillance cameras captured video of the burglary, which occurred on Nov. 7 at 8:30 p.m. The video showed a person wearing a green jacket checking the door handles and entering the vehicle before leaving with a bag containing $150 in loose quarters. The person was last seen walking northbound on 18th Avenue from 23rd Street. Also reported missing from the vehicle was a pair of Gucci sunglasses valued at $400. When police arrived at the scene, they found the Honda facing northbound with front passenger side damage and the driver slumped over the steering wheel. The driver was not immediately responsive and later was taken to the hospital for treatment. He was not seriously injured. Police reported finding an open 1.5-liter bottle of vodka on the front passenger seat. In addition to DUI, the driver was cited for illegal transportation of open alcohol and other traffic offenses. According to police, they found the Ford facing north in the middle of the roadway of Oak Avenue, which is a one-way street going south. The driver reportedly admitted to drinking prior to getting behind the wheel. His blood-alcohol content was reported to be .18, which is more than twice the legal limit of .08. In addition to DUI, the driver was cited for driving the wrong way down a one-way street and failure to reduce speed to avoid a crash. A 32-year-old Lemont man, hospitalized after he was beaten bloody in a Riverside alley on the evening of Nov. 12 apparently because he owed someone money, refused to press charges against his assailant, according to police. Officers responded to the alley between Lincoln and Groveland avenues at about 7:10 p.m. in response to a call of two men fighting. Upon arrival they encountered one man walking toward Park Place and another stumbling toward a Groveland Avenue residence. A trail of blood led police to a two-flat where police reported finding the victim “covered in blood.” Two other people, a man and a woman, were in the residence and said they did not know what happened to the victim, only that the two men had been arguing. North Riverside police charged a 24-year-old LaPorte, Indiana, woman with aggravated speeding after an officer on patrol reported clocking her Kia sedan traveling at 86 mph in a 35-mph zone while westbound in the 7700 block of Cermak Road on Nov. 11 just after midnight. After taking the woman into custody, police turned the car over to her husband, who was one of two passengers inside the vehicle at the time of the traffic stop. A resident of the 2200 block of Hainsworth Avenue, North Riverside, called police last week to report that someone had stolen an Amazon package from the front porch of his residence. The package, containing $289 in merchandise, was delivered on the morning of Nov. 2 when the victim was at work. The delivery person notified the victim of the delivery, attaching a photo of the package on the porch as verification. When the victim arrived home that evening, the package was gone. North Riverside police charged a teenage girl with battery and disorderly conduct and an 18-year-old Chicago woman with three counts of misdemeanor battery, one count of disorderly conduct, one count of criminal damage to property and one count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor after they allegedly attacked a female employee at the Banter by Piercing Pagoda kiosk on the upper level of the North Riverside Park Mall, 7501 Cermak Road, on Nov. 13 at about 4:10 p.m. Two other employees reportedly told police that the adult offender and the juvenile offender attacked the victim from behind while she was on her lunch break. The adult offender reportedly snatched the wig from the victim’s head and punched her in the face. The victim told police she hadn’t seen the juvenile offender in two years and had no idea why she attacked her. The juvenile offender reportedly told police she’d been planning to fight the victim for years but didn’t know where she worked. Seeing her on Nov. 13 was a coincidence, she reportedly said. The adult offender helped her during the fight, the juvenile reportedly told police. No one was hurt on Nov. 8 at about 5:45 p.m. when a 74-year-old Berwyn woman lost control of her vehicle, which was northbound in the 2800 block of Harlem Avenue, crossed into oncoming traffic and jumped the curb onto the parkway in Riverside. According to the police report, the driver said she lost control of the vehicle while trying to move one of her dogs, which had jumped onto her lap and then under her legs. Police cited the driver for damage to village property and having no proof of vehicle insurance. These items were obtained from police reports filed by the Riverside, North Riverside and Brookfield police departments, Nov. 7-13, and represent a portion of the incidents to which police responded. Unless otherwise indicated, anybody named in these reports has only been charged with a crime. These cases have not been adjudicated. — Compiled by Bob Uphues Sign up for our free newsletter to get latest news and updates on Riverside, Brookfield and North Riverside.'}]"

I know we don’t have a crystal ball, but is there any advantage to push these bids out further hoping the supply chain improves and these numbers come down?”David Bein, assistant superintendent of business, said the district should go out for bid as soon as possible since any additional delays will impact the high school construction timeline and costs could increase.“We’ve wrestled with this,” Bein said. “At the end of day, the right path forward is to get the scope modified, get out on the street and bring this back to the board and lock this up so it’s something we know we can afford.” In March 2020, voters of SD220 approved a $147 million bond referendum to cover the costs of renovations and improvements at the high school, two middle schools, eight elementary schools and the district’s early childhood center. The district is working with Pepper Construction and architecture firm DLR Group on the multi-phase project – which is expected to last until 2025. Information on each of the planned projects by school can be found on the district website.“The budget on the high school is $60 million,” said Bein, explaining that renovation plans at many of the other district schools are coming in under budget. “We’re working with a $147 million pot. We’re trying to accomplish all of the things we shared with the community and everything we promised we would do with the referendum proceeds.”The administrative team has been looking at alternate plans to reduce the costs of some of the design plans, Bein said, adding he plans to bring an updated timeline for the district-wide project to the board in February.Some board members worried changes might compromise the overall vision.“We do believe with adjustments we can reorganize and accomplish this overall,” deputy superintendent Craig Winkelman assured the board. “We believe with a little restructuring, we can stay on track.”In addition approving the contract for BHS, trustees approved amendments to the agreements with the DLR Group for projects at Arnett C. Lines Elementary School, Barbara Rose Elementary School, the Early Learning Center and the North Barrington Elementary School.Separately, the board also approved an increase in pay for substitute teachers in the district.“We’re experiencing an uptick in [COVID-19] cases, reflective of what happened over break, and the most pressing concern is staffing and the ability to staff and keep teachers healthy so we can open,” Hunt told the board.The superintendent said the district had 44 staff members out on Jan. 10 related to COVID-19.“We now allow teachers who are home and not symptomatic to now virtually come into the classrooms,” he said.Hunt asked the board to increase the substitute teacher rate from $110 a day to $135 daily pay.“It’s one more way to staff and keep kids in school and help get through this surge,” Hunt said. “If the primary goal is to stay in school, keeping available staff right now during the surge, it’s critically important.”Principal Steve McWilliams also shared with the board some mitigation measures that have been put in place at the high school.“Our spacing [between students in the cafeteria] wasn’t great, particularly when we can’t go outside to eat,” McWilliams said. “We were having to move a number of our students across the building to the gymnasium, which was causing disruption in the world language hallways.”As a result, desks and chairs that had been lined up and facing forward in the cafeteria have been removed, he said. Now, larger tables for four students each, as well as high top tables for more flexible seating, are being used. He said banks of lockers have been moved to open another common space for eating lunch, and the auditorium has been opened as a flexible area for students to hang out with their friends and eat.“Students can group together and sit together with friends in what we think is a much more comfortable manner,” McWilliams said.As part of his superintendent report, Hunt also shared preliminary results from a 139-page demographic study conducted at the district.“We are down 500 students from where we were pre-Covid,” Hunt said, adding many parents are making the decision to home school their children or send them to private school. He said that enrollment nationally is down 3%, with the majority of that trend reflected in the grades of pre-kindergarten and kindergarten.Hunt said the district currently serves 8,156 students but the demographic study projects 7,900 students by the 2025-2026 school year. Hunt said this gradual decline in enrollment is based on such data as birthrates, housing construction within the district and migration to Barrington. He said Bein will use this information to create financial forecasts for the district moving forward.Elizabeth Owens-Schiele is a freelancer.

Touting one of the largest and most comprehensive sake collections in town, it enchanted locals with Japanese bar fare” writes Eater Chicago. “Though it wasn’t Chicago’s first izakaya—it opened around two months after Boka launched Izakaya at Momotaro—it accrued a loyal following among neighborhood residents for its friendly atmosphere and passionate chef.” Why Isn’t Beer Sold In Plastic Bottles? WGN-TV is on it: “Beer tends to lose its carbonation and become stale in plastic bottles, whereas soda does not. ‘Plastic is simply not a good package for beer,’ said Chuck Skypeck, the director of technical brewing projects at the Brewers Association. ‘The molecular structure of most plastics is not good at keeping carbonation in the project and package for keeping oxygen out to prevent staling.'” Legislation Could Help Illinois Wineries A bill has been introduced that could help Illinois wineries hurt by the pandemic, reports the Alton Telegraph. While “Illinois is one of the top wine-drinking states in the country, the state’s wineries are prohibited from producing and selling wine at levels that compare with their peers in the beer and spirits industries… ‘If we had the ability to increase the volume of wine that we’re distributing, we could expand our coverage area and better serve retailers with more product variety at a lower price–all of which would benefit our consumers,’ said Jim Ewers, general manager of Blue Sky Vineyard in Makanda. ‘Allowing us to produce and directly distribute more would also lead to more work, more jobs, and greater benefits to our local economy as well.'” Organizing Spreads At Chicago-Area Starbucks Is the nationwide increase of union organizing at Starbucks a bellwether for food and drink chains? “Employees at the Starbucks at 155 North Wabash were the first in the area to file for a union election… Staff at two more Chicago stores and two in the suburbs have requested elections,” reports the Sun-Times. “The Chicago stores are in Logan Square, 2543 North California and Hyde Park, 1174 East 55th. The suburban sites are 38 South La Grange Road, La Grange and 620 Northwest Highway, Cary.” A Starbucks in Calgary, Alberta, awaits its ballot results. “Union organizers overwhelmingly won a vote Friday to represent workers at a Starbucks in Mesa, Arizona, giving them their third win in an effort to organize the sector,” CNN reports. “The union, Starbucks Workers United, had already won the right to represent workers at two stores in Buffalo, New York… The union has also filed to hold additional elections at more than a hundred Starbucks stores across twenty-six states… Company filings show Starbucks had 235,000 employees at nearly 9,000 company-operated stores… The company is throwing significant resources, including visits by top executives to stores holding votes, to convince employees not to unionize… Those who study labor movements say this is already a significant union effort given the difficulty that labor has organizing new businesses, especially at restaurants and bars.” Old Town Independent Grocery Scene Catches Fire The CEO of Old Town grocery store Plum Market says that Dom’s casts “a dark shadow on independent grocers,” Crain’s reports, saying that Bob Mariano’s “newest venture moving into the same building is driving them out of business.” Matthew Jonna sent a letter to customers, “saying that its Old Town location will close in June. The closure was not in the company’s plan. ‘The truth is, there was a quiet back-door agreement that took place between our landlord… and Dom’s,’ Jonna said in the letter. ‘Those clandestine dealings resulted in the termination of our lease, without Plum Market ever having an option to negotiate or keep our store open.’” WGN-TV: “Plum said that the impending closure will cost 120 employees their jobs.” A further statement from Plum’s CEO: “Simply put, our landlord’s decision to terminate our lease without even having the decency to reach out to us, and Dom’s decision to pursue our location are unconscionable, dishonorable, and disgusting.” 2Bears Tavern Uptown Opens In March “2Bears Tavern Group—which owns and operates Andersonville’s The SoFo Tap and Meeting House Tavern and Rogers Park’s Jackhammer—will open 2Bears Tavern Uptown on March 10 at in the former Nick’s on Wilson space at 1140 West Wilson,” reports Uptown Update. “Located on the first floor of the FLATS’ ‘Bachelor’ residential building, this LGBTQIA+ tavern will boast free pinball, video games and darts; seven TVs; cocktails, CBD beverages and eight rotating drafts; be dog-friendly and have a late-night tavern license.” Albion Manor And The Parlour At The Albion Set Lincoln Park Opening The Albion Manor and The Parlour at The Albion will be home to an English pub and cocktail parlour over two levels at 1480 West Webster, the partners announce in a release. “Married partners Julia Shell and Jamie Hale have blended their personalities from their two other restaurant concepts, AJ Hudson’s Public House and The Dandy Crown to create The Albion Manor and The Parlour at The Albion. Albion was the archetypal name for the island of Great Britain, referencing the chalk-like white cliffs of Dover, and The Albion Manor is a warm and welcoming English pub. The first-floor bar is nearly the room’s length, complemented with high-top tables in the front and six custom-built English snugs in the rear. The Albion Manor will show live international sports on the telly, particularly footy, along with other local and national sports.” More here. LIT Garth Greenwell On The Thought That Books""}]"

Selig were honored at the annual CAPS Awards at Meson Sabika. CAPS, which stands for Citizens Appreciate Public Safety, is a Naperville community group that recognizes public safety personnel for their contributions to the city.Naperville Police Chief Jason Arres said: “People often only think about crimes and arrests when they think about the police department, but so much of what our officers do is rooted in service to the community.

She says she’s very grateful to be recognized.“I was very lucky. I definitely think someone was watching over them,” she said.The first event happened in May 2021, when Madden responded to a call for help at a Naperville residence. Arriving within three minutes, she found a man sitting in a patio chair in his yard, unresponsive. After determining he wasn’t breathing, she lowered him to the ground and began chest compressions. She completed about 70 compressions by herself before medics from the fire department arrived to help.“He had just mowed the lawn and the weather was just too hot. He had a heart attack,” Madden recalled. “I’m so grateful he lived.”Once in hospital, the patient remained stable with his heart now beating on its own. Numerous fire department personnel complimented Madden afterwards, saying it was her initial efforts that saved him. Six weeks later, she used AED pads to shock a coach back to life on the baseball field at Naperville Central High School. The devastating event, in the middle of a game, was witnessed by the victim’s son, who was playing. Naperville police Officer Michael Selig – Original Credit:A nurse on the scene had already begun rescue breaths when Madden arrived with two other officers.

He looked me right in the eye and asked me to go with so I walked with him and sat in the ambulance. I stayed with him in the hospital until he was comfortable.”Selig said this type of call is not unusual.“I don’t want to yell at them. My objective is to de-escalate the situation,” he said. “In Naperville you don’t get a lot of confrontations, but any officer would be a little bit nervous because you don’t want a fight. You do what you have to do.”Selig says he is grateful for the recognition, which was unexpected.“I appreciate someone is watching what we do,” he said. The Citizens Appreciate Public Safety (CAPS) Board of Directors presented 13 CAPS Awards Thursday night to members of the Naperville Police Department in recognition of their contributions to the community in the last year.Like Selig, Officer Mark Lahtinen has been on the force for three years. He spoke with the suicidal man’s girlfriend outside to assess the situation.“Her description was that he was very angry and would fight anyone who wanted to help,” he said. “We go through a lot of training about de-escalation and you have to have a plan on how to help.”After the incident with the police, the man they helped spent six days going through detox in the hospital and is now committed to taking the necessary steps for sobriety and wellness, officials said.Hilary Decent is a freelance journalist who moved to Naperville from England in 2007.hilarydecent@gmail.com On Thursday, May 19, officers Courtney Madden, Mark Lahtinen and Michael Selig were honored at the annual CAPS Awards at Meson Sabika. CAPS, which stands for Citizens Appreciate Public Safety, is a Naperville community group that recognizes public safety personnel for their contributions to the city. Naperville Police Chief Jason Arres said: “People often only think about crimes and arrests when they think about the police department, but so much of what our officers do is rooted in service to the community. These officers’ use of their life-saving skills and de-escalation training offers a small glimpse into the human side of policing and the great work our men and women do on a regular basis that are kind of outside the norm of what police are known for. I couldn’t be more proud of them and the service they provide the Naperville community.” Madden, who has been a police officer for almost seven years, was presented with two awards after saving the lives of two men just weeks apart. She says she’s very grateful to be recognized. “I was very lucky. I definitely think someone was watching over them,” she said. The first event happened in May 2021, when Madden responded to a call for help at a Naperville residence. Arriving within three minutes, she found a man sitting in a patio chair in his yard, unresponsive. After determining he wasn’t breathing, she lowered him to the ground and began chest compressions. She completed about 70 compressions by herself before medics from the fire department arrived to help. “He had just mowed the lawn and the weather was just too hot. He had a heart attack,” Madden recalled. “I’m so grateful he lived.” Once in hospital, the patient remained stable with his heart now beating on its own. Numerous fire department personnel complimented Madden afterwards, saying it was her initial efforts that saved him. Six weeks later, she used AED pads to shock a coach back to life on the baseball field at Naperville Central High School. The devastating event, in the middle of a game, was witnessed by the victim’s son, who was playing. A nurse on the scene had already begun rescue breaths when Madden arrived with two other officers. She ran to the dugout and after locating the victim, started doing chest compressions. It soon became apparent that the coach had suffered a heart attack and the best way to save him was to use AED pads. “I cut off his shirt and applied the pads. We continued while the fire brigade set up,” Madden said. “He started coughing and was obviously in a lot of pain. I have never seen an AED shock someone and have them wake up right away. His son witnessed the whole thing.” When police officers are called to a case, adrenaline takes over, she said. “You have to assess the patient and see what they need,” she said. “It’s only when medics take over or the patient is transferred that there’s an adrenaline dump. It doesn’t hit till after. A lot of us are very used to it, it’s part of our routine.” Officers Michael Selig and Mark Lahtinen saved the life of a suicidal army vet last June. They were called to assist firefighters with an intoxicated male subject who admitted he’d been drinking for days and wanted to die. Selig tried to reason with'}]"

Sean McVay, who was born in Dayton and attended Miami University, had as his defensive coordinator Wade Phillips and as quarterbacks coach present Bengals’ coach Zac Taylor. They were led on offense by quarterback Jared Goff who passed for 4688 yards and 32 touchdowns with a passer rating of 101.1. Todd Gurley led in rushing with 1251 yards and 17 touchdowns and in receiving they were led by Robert Woods (1219 yards, 6 TD’s), Brandin Cooks (1204 yards, 5 TD’s) and Gurley (580 yards, 4 TD’s). They were led on defense by Cory Littleton with 90 tackles and John Johnson with 82, by Aaron Donald with 20.5 sacks and John Johnson with four interceptions. Their place kicker was Greg Zuerlein who made 27 of 31 field goal tries. The Patriots were led on offense by 41-year old Tom Brady playing in his ninth Super Bowl and his nineteenth NFL season who threw for 4355 yards with 29 touchdowns and a passer rating of 97.7, running back Sony Michel (931, 6 TD’s) and receivers James White (751, 7 TD’s), Julian Edelman (850 yards, 6 TD’s) and Rob Gronkowski (682 yards, 3 TD’s). They were led on defense by Devin McCourty with 59 tackles, his twin brother Jason McCourty with 54, Kyle Van Noy with 55 and Patrick Chung with 52. Trey Flowers led in sacks with 7.5 and Duron Harman in interceptions with 4. Their place kicker was Stephen Gostkowski who converted on 27 of 31 field goal attempts. This Super Bowl would prove to be a low scoring affair and the only scoring in the first half was a 42-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski and the Patriots lead 3-0 at halftime. In the third quarter, Greg Zuerlein evened the score at 3-3 with a 53-yard field goal as the defensive struggle continued. The score remained tied until halfway into the fourth quarter. Tom Brady completed passes of 18 and 29 yards to Rob Gronkowski and one of 13 yards to Julian Edelman to set up a two-yard touchdown run by Sony Michel. The extra point was good and the Patriots lead 10-3. On the next drive by the Rams, Jared Goff led his team downfield starting from their own 25 and got to the New England 27-yard line where a pass meant for Brandin Cooks was intercepted by Stephon Gilmore at the 4-yard line. Had Goff been able to convert on that series of plays and if Greg Zuerlein had made the 48-yard field goal attempt with eight seconds left in the game, it could have been a tie game after regulation. But, Stephon Gilmore made the big play and the Patriots’ touchdown was the only touchdown scored in the game as Gostkowski added another field goal and the final score was 13-3, the lowest scoring Super Bowl in history, in favor of the Patriots. Julian Edelman got the game MVP with 10 catches for 141 yards as the Patriots won their sixth Super Bowl in the Brady-Belichick era. New England has not been back to the Super Bowl while the Los Angeles Rams were back in 2022. Statistics for this article were from pro-football-reference.com.

edition of the Du Quoin Call will be its last. Although well-supported by the community for many, many years, the Call has been facing many of the same issues that newspapers all around the country are facing - rising costs, with fewer sources of income, particularly advertising and classifieds. Unfortunately, interest in the paper has been on a steady decline for several years and today it is no longer sustainable. In its heyday the Call - for most of its life The Du Quoin Evening Call - was subscribed to by more than 70% of all homes in Du Quoin, a level of loyalty almost unheard of in the newspaper business. Since its debut on Nov. 2, 1895 it has been a favorite place for Du Quoin residents to find their local news, good and bad; stories about themselves and their neighbors; local sports and obituaries, and where they kept up with the day-to-day goings-on about town. The newspaper celebrated with the community in good times and mourned with it in bad. According to Volume 2 of a Perry County history published in 1998, the Evening Call was introduced in 1895 by Major Andrew J. Alden, a former Union officer and a southern Illinois native who was the son of Pinckneyville Democrat publisher Roy Alden. Alden disposed of the Call within a couple years, and it was held by different people until 1899, when Augustus William (A.W.) Essick became publisher. When Essick died on Nov. 22, 1945, the paper was bought by Lucius (L.S.) Smith Jr., who died in 1984. In December 1986, stock in the newspaper was sold by Smith\'s family to American Publishing, a holding company for Hollinger Inc., the former Canadian media giant run by Conrad Black. It was the first time the paper was owned by non-local interests, and the Evening Call was among eight southern Illinois newspapers acquired by Hollinger at the time, including the Benton Evening News, the Canton Daily Ledger, the Carmi Times, the Eldorado Daily Journal, the Marion Daily Republican, the Murphysboro American, and the West Frankfort Daily American. In 1997, the Call became part of Liberty Group Publishing, one of about 160 newspapers sold to Liberty by Hollinger. In June 2005 an investment group bought Liberty, and the Evening Call became part of the new GateHouse Media. And in August 2016, the Evening Call and other local papers in Marion, Benton, Harrisburg and Chester were acquired by Paddock Publications, publishers of the Daily Herald in the north, northwest and west suburbs of Chicago. Until the sale to Paddock in 2016, GateHouse had been intending to shutter the Call and some other southern Illinois newspapers. We\'re pleased we could give the Call an additional six years of life, although that doesn\'t make today\'s announcement any easier. The newspaper\'s growth in the mid- to late- 20th century is attributable to many Evening Call employees and leaders, but perhaps none more iconic than Gene Gallmeister and John Croessman. Gallmeister started out at the Call in 1954 after he left the service, and spent the next 70-plus years there as a pressman, graphics editor and eventually as the man in charge of publications. Fred Huff Sr. and Gallmeister graduated from Du Quoin Township High School together in 1944, and both would go to work at the Call. ""He started working part-time at The Call just a few months before I did,"" Huff recalled. ""He never worked anywhere else. He knew every piece of that press."" Croessman came back to his hometown of Du Quoin with a journalism degree after four years at SIU, and went to work for the Evening Call. When ill health forced him to retire in 2017, it was with 42 years of service to the newspaper and the community. Today, John Croessman Square on Main Street in Du Quoin is a testament to the community\'s regard for his work. These men, and the men and women who have dedicated themselves to the Call over the past century and right up until today, have done the best they could to bring Du Quoin a quality newspaper. On behalf of all of them - the publishers, editors, reporters, photographers, advertising reps, circulation and office staff, paperboys, pressmen and more, who built and sustained the Call for 127 years - we bid you a bittersweet adieu.

of playing time last season.There were two good reasons for that. Srbinov was the backup to then-senior Jayden Dean, an all-area first team and unanimous all-conference pick, and there also was a major shortcoming in his game.“He never played because he didn’t play defense last year,” Neuqua Valley coach Todd Sutton said. “You don’t play defense, you don’t play.“Nope, not going to happen.”Srbinov took that to heart and worked hard over the summer.The results have been stellar. The 6-foot-1 senior is a starter who is playing well at both ends of the floor.“He’s had some very good games,” Sutton said. “At Naperville North last Friday, he was extremely good, and he makes his free throws down the stretch. He’s making some great plays for us.” Neuqua Valley’s Chris Srbinov (4) celebrates with teammates after scoring on a layup as time expired in the second quarter of a game against Naperville Central in Naperville on Friday, Dec. 9, 2022.Srbinov made several great plays — and a bunch of nice shots — to lead the Wildcats to a hard-fought 64-59 DuPage Valley Conference victory at Naperville Central on Friday. He sank eight of his first nine shots and finished with a team-high 19 points. Junior guard Luke Kinkade, who chipped in 16 points, was glad to see it.“Chris has been great all season,” Kinkade said. “Running the court, the fast-break layups really help us, and his steals are key. And his jump shot got so much better from last year. He can really shoot the ball now.”Srbinov made five shots, including a 3-pointer, to help the Wildcats (6-2, 2-0) outscore the Redhawks (4-5, 0-2) by 19 points in the second quarter. He ended the first half by making a steal with three seconds left and racing up the court for a buzzer-beating layup to give Neuqua Valley a 38-24 cushion.“I just started clicking,” Srbinov said. “No one was making shots. I decided to step up and take some shots. At the end of the half, I got that steal and layup, and that definitely set the tone for the second half.”Srbinov began the third quarter by making a pull-up jumper and another layup, and he wound up with four steals. But that wasn’t what impressed Sutton.“Defense isn’t about steals,” Sutton said. “That’s NBA defense. Real defense is keeping your man out of the lane and helping recover. That’s where he’s improved. He’ll tell you that too.” Neuqua Valley’s Chris Srbinov (4) intercepts a pass by Naperville Central’s Gavin Wade during a game in Naperville on Friday, Dec. 9, 2022.Indeed, Srbinov said he has really focused on improving his defense, and he isn’t particular about where he gets assistance.“Last year I sat behind Jayden, and I learned a lot,” he said. “Being in the gym with Todd Sutton helps. He teaches you a lot about defense at practice. I still have to get better at taking charges.”Even there, Srbinov has a good mentor in senior forward Nic Lendino, a defensive-minded player if ever there was one.“I’ve been playing with him since elementary school,” Srbinov said. “Watching him play defense, you can see how much heart he really puts into it, and you can take away from that.”The Wildcats showed heart after the Redhawks used an 11-0 run to take a 55-51 lead in the fourth quarter.

Twenty-five years ago, she discovered Kindermusik — first as a participant with her child, then as a teacher, and now as owner and director of Kindermusik Northshore.“I have two kids and my younger one took classes in Lincolnshire with Miss Diane,” Glickman said. “I watched her teach and thought to myself, ‘I could do this really, really well.’ At the time I was working as a microbiologist, which is what my degree is in. I decided that I wanted to change careers and follow my heart.”It seemed like a perfect fit. “I’ve been a singer my whole life and always loved music and young kids,” Glickman declared. In order to become a Kindermusik teacher, Glickman took the required classes to become licensed but didn’t begin teaching until the former owner took her aside and told her, “I’ve been watching you and you’re really good with kids and you’ve a great voice. Would you consider taking this program because it’s gotten too big?,” Glickman related. She became so engrossed in the program that Glickman taught as many as 15 classes each week.“I worked for the woman who owned the company until four-and-a-half years ago. Then I bought it from her,” Glickman related, noting that “Kindermusik is an international company. I use their products to create my own program.”Kindermusik Northshore starts its 25th year in September.The program has grown to serving over 200 families each week at locations in Deerfield, Glenview, Highland Park, Lake Forest, Northbrook, and Vernon Hills.Classes are divided by age: 0-16 months, 16 months-3 years, and 3-5 years. A parent or caregiver participates with their child for the first two age groups; the third age group is a drop-off program. Each class is one hour.“We start and end in a circle,” Glickman said. “We sing a familiar hello and goodbye song. In-between we have circle songs, instrument play-alongs, fingerplay, story time, rocking time, and lots and lots and lots of movement. Children at that age learn music by moving their bodies with the music.” For the fall session, starting in September, Kindermusik Northshore will be offering over 20 classes; Glickman is teaching eleven of them. Approximately twelve kids attend each class. The cost for an eight-week class ranges from $150-$170, which includes the material for the parent or caregiver.To serve the growing program, Glickman brought on two additional licensed teachers this year, Elise Hackl-Blumstein, and Megan Moore. They join licensed teacher Kara Spector, who has worked at Kindermusik Northshore for nearly seven years. The Kindermusik Northshore team includes (left to right) Kara Spector, Director Cathy Glickman, Elise Hackl-Blumstein, and Megan Moore.Before joining Kindermusik Northshore, Spector was a middle school music and English teacher. She began attending Kindermusik training when she was pregnant with her daughter, and then brought her daughter to Kindermusik classes.Spector said she was inspired to begin working with Kindermusik when she and Glickman were in a production of “Seussical the Musical” together at Big Deal Productions in Buffalo Grove.“Cathy was this magnetic, talented lady. She looked like she was having so much fun on her job. She would talk about it all the time at rehearsal,” Spector recalled.There are so many things that Spector likes about teaching Kindermusik compared to teaching middle school. But she is particularly impressed by the fact that, “You get to see this beautiful bonding relationship between the parents and the children,” she said.Spector will be teaching nine classes in Vernon Hills and Glenview for the fall session.Both Glickman and Spector praise the benefits children gain by participating in Kindermusik classes.Glickman said that musically they learn about such things as steady beat and tempo. Personality-wise they learn how to take turns and delay gratification. Older children get to play in an ensemble.In addition to the musical benefits, Spector noted that kids learn “how to socialize, how to interact, how to bond with their parents, how to integrate into a group of people.”Glickman stressed that Kindermusik is “a research-based curriculum. Everything that we do has been based on research for young children.” Every month, there’s a new theme and the parent or caregiver gets the music and activities so they can work with the children at home, too.The classes also benefit the parent or caregiver because “It gives them something to do with their child that is both fun and educational,” Glickman said.Despite their busy teaching schedules with Kindermusik, Glickman and Spector both continue to pursue their other musical interests. Glickman, who is an acclaimed Chicago cabaret artist, will perform her one-person show, “It’s a Man’s World,” Aug. 13 and 14 at Davenport’s Piano Bar and Cabaret in Chicago. Spector works with more than 30 third-graders through adults weekly at her voice studio. She is currently vocal directing “The Sound of Music” for Big Noise Theatre in Des Plaines.For additional details and registration information on the six Kindermusik Northshore sites, visit kindermusiknorthshore.com.Myrna Petlicki is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press. “I have two kids and my younger one took classes in Lincolnshire with Miss Diane,” Glickman said. “I watched her teach and thought to myself, ‘I could do this really, really well.’ At the time I was working as a microbiologist, which is what my degree is in.

They attended Brothers & Sisters, a group of friends who gather for dinner each week at a different restaurant, and on this particular Friday, they dined somewhere on the west side. It was close to 9 when they headed home. As Poole turned north on MacArthur Boulevard, she noticed a few cars weaving impatiently through the heavy traffic. One of those impatient drivers, in a light-colored SUV, was behind her as she crossed South Grand. Poole was in the left lane, and as they neared Washington Park, the SUV swung into the right lane, cut back in front of Poole and accelerated. ""I\'m looking to see if there\'s another car coming,"" she says, ""because on Friday nights, I\'ve seen it before where kids are chasing each other."" As the SUV sped ahead, she realized the driver was turning left on Fayette Street. ""I wasn\'t sure he was really going to make it on four wheels,"" she says. ""That\'s how fast he appeared to be going, to me."" With her window down, Poole heard a ""chonk"" – the heavy thud of the speeding vehicle crashing against ""something soft"" with a slightly metallic overtone. ""I\'m thinking, \'Oh my God, he\'s hit a kid on a bike.\' Because what I see come up in the air is reflections off of ... something,"" she says. ""I couldn\'t even tell what he had hit."" What the SUV had hit was my dog Rosie and me. The flashes, Poole guesses, might have been my glasses, the necklace I was wearing and Rosie\'s reflective leash. Poole followed the SUV and saw me lying in the gravel on the north side of Fayette. She parked close enough to shield me from other cars, stifling her urge to ""just keep driving"" in pursuit of that SUV. She watched it slow down about a block away, almost to a stop, before taking off again. While Poole flagged down another motorist and told them to chase the SUV, Harris stood over me and dialed 911. ""I had two fingers on your right shoulder, trying to get you to lay still, because you kept wiggling around, asking about your dog,"" she later told me. I remember asking – not very politely – for Harris to move those two fingers off my arm, which was suddenly painfully utterly nonfunctional. We later learned my humerus had been ripped off its fractured humeral head. ""When I saw the pictures, I said to April: no wonder she told me to move my hand,"" Harris says. After I was loaded into the ambulance, the EMTs informed me that Rosie had been killed. Strapped to a trauma board, all I could do was lie there and let the tears wash down my face. *** Rosie had been my best friend for almost five years. She came to me through Epic Rescue – essentially a few women crazy in the best way – who picked up a pack of dogs that were wandering the streets of Tulsa. Epic founder Liz Luper remembers Rosie as the dog that could consume an entire rotisserie chicken without setting off the live trap. She also recalls that Rosie smelled ""like a dumpster fire."" Jill Egizii, who volunteers with WILD Canine Rescue, which collaborated with Epic, told me she personally picked more than 100 ticks off Rosie. Her body had scars, her ears had fly strikes, but she was a beautiful specimen of a bonemouth SharPei. One Saturday morning, while we were out for a stroll, Rosie was attacked by a pitbull that jumped out of its fence and silently snuck up behind us. We three rolled around in the street, covered in dog piss and saliva, me hanging onto Rosie\'s leash and screaming till the pit\'s owner came out and grabbed his dog. Rosie suffered several puncture wounds, and we both sustained a deep wariness of other dogs. This terrifying encounter happened just a few months after I got Rosie. From then on, we tended to take walks early in the morning and after dark, when most other dogs were home in bed. Family pets are family, and that was especially true of Rosie\'s relationship with my son Evan. On school days, if he slept through his alarm, I\'d send Rosie into his room to sniff his toes and lick his face, so he would wake up laughing. When he had panic attacks, she calmed him down. When he ruptured his Achilles, she would lean her whole body against his orthopedic boot like she was trying to give his leg a hug. On a few occasions, when I wasn\'t home, Rosie escaped. Each time, her first stop was the Washington Park duck pond. But one terrible summer, when I was spending up to 16 hours a day at the Capitol covering budget shenanigans, Rosie went missing for nearly two weeks. The angels at Sangamon County Lost & Found Pets plastered her picture on telephone poles all over town, and by the time she was found, Rosie had become a local celebrity. But at the moment she died, Rosie wasn\'t heading for the duck pond. This time, she was headed home. Judging from the skid marks and blood spatter we found along Fayette the next morning, Rosie had apparently gotten jammed up in the wheel well of that light-colored SUV. The momentary stop April Poole saw when the SUV driver slowed down was where Rosie dropped to the ground. My precious somehow made it about half a block east toward home – I cannot imagine and don\'t want to know what kind of shape she must\'ve been in – before she laid down in the grass and died. In the eight months since that night, I\'ve found solace in two facts: First, that Rosie didn\'t die alone. Several people were there to comfort her, and a passing motorist even stopped and donated her own dog\'s blanket to Rosie. The second may be more important. That\'s the knowledge that with her death, Rosie would help take an armed habitual criminal off the streets of Springfield. *** We knew who hit Rosie and me a few days after it happened. A high-quality security system caught the crash on video, and I shared that footage on social media. Car buffs instantly identified the SUV as a Porsche Cayenne circa 2010 to 2014 (it was a 2012). No license plate was visible, but the extra-dark tint on the windows set it apart. Some people in my DMs provided information on businesses that distinctive Porsche frequented; one or more mentioned the driver by name. I asked all messengers to call Crimestoppers, and told them WILD had put up a $1,000 reward on Rosie\'s behalf. By Tuesday morning, when Springfield Police officers came to my house, we realized we had been hearing the same name. Detective Dan Weiss sounded appropriately skeptical. ""Just because somebody\'s got a vehicle that matches the video doesn\'t mean that\'s who did it,"" he said. Immediately, I liked his style. Weiss wasn\'t trying to solve this case fast; he was trying to solve it right. And even though all tips pointed to one man – Dexter Darnell Hughes – Weiss wasn\'t going to jump to any conclusions. It would be almost too easy to believe it was Hughes. As one tipster told me: ""He was already on parole for a hit-and-run. That\'s what he does. Because he almost always has drugs on him, so he can\'t stop."" Weiss wouldn\'t tell me much about Hughes except that he was well-known to SPD, typically refused to stop when they would try to pull him over, was usually armed, and should be considered dangerous. ""He has a very extensive criminal history, and a lot of the crimes he\'s been involved in are very serious crimes,"" Weiss said. But as an old reporter, I couldn\'t resist the urge to dig into Dexter Hughes\' history myself. With the help of a former colleague, I acquired enough court records and police reports to recognize that – for a guy who\'s only 28 years old – Hughes is a fairly prodigious small-town outlaw. He was arrested for disorderly conduct, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, and unlawful use of a weapon – all before he turned 18. As an adult, his charges include more of the same, plus DUIs, resisting arrest, and weapons violations. He has pleaded guilty to felony manufacture/delivery of a controlled substance (crack cocaine). He has so many incidents of reckless driving that I feel offended when anyone refers to our traumatic encounter as an ""accident.""

2022 1957 2022 Aleta Jane Nord Aug. 7, 1957 - Apr. 3, 2022 BLOOMINGTON - Aleta Jane Nord, age 64, passed away peacefully on Sunday, April 3, 2022, at OSF St. Francis Medical Center in Peoria. She was born August 7, 1957, in Salem Illinois, the youngest child of William ""Red"" and Lois (Lyons) Patton. Aleta is survived by her sons: Jason and Travis Wheeler; her sister, Debbie Henderson; brothers: Keith Patton, Marvin Patton, Kenny Patton and seven grandchildren: Cecelia, Wyatt, Destiny, Davin, Trayson, Barrett and Lily. She was preceded in death by her parents and her daughter, Brandy Corbett. Aleta was independent, spontaneous and always ready for a new adventure. This first became evident when at the age of 14 she left Salem and moved to Bloomington on her own. For most of the last fifty years Aleta worked as a server in several restaurants throughout Bloomington-Normal. She owned and operated her own restaurant, Aleta Jane\'s Cafe on Morrissey Drive in Bloomington for fifteen years, closing in 2016. She truly enjoyed serving and took a genuine interest in her customers resulting in so many of them becoming her friend. Aleta was a small woman with a ready smile, seemingly endless energy, and enormous generosity. She had an uncanny knack for finding incredible treasures at garage and estate sales, eagerly awaited the first of the garden tomatoes every summer and was a terrible backseat driver. She was an amazing cook and often shared her culinary creations with friends accompanied by a glass of wine, conversation and much laughter. She was funny, kind, compassionate and will be greatly missed. At Aleta\'s request, there will be no funeral or memorial service. To plant trees in memory, please visit the Sympathy Store.

local man is facing new charges following a Nov. 17 incident in Columbia. Jared M. Franke, 24, of Columbia, was charged with felony obstruction of justice after allegedly refusing to submit to a chemical test as mandated through a warrant. He was also charged with unlawful possession of a firearm within five years of being in a mental institution and aggravated unlawful use of a weapon in a vehicle without FOID. Columbia police said that at about 8 p.m. Nov. 17, an officer conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle that was stopped in the left turn lane of Route 3 at Frontage Road. The driver, later identified as Franke, was not alert when approached by the officer and refused to submit to a drug test at the scene. Police obtained a court ordered warrant to have Franke tested, and he was then transported to Red Bud Regional Hospital for testing. Franke continued to refuse testing at this point, police said, resulting him being taken to the Monroe County Jail. Police recovered a loaded Ruger .22 caliber revolver under the driver’s seat of Franke’s vehicle during the stop, and a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun with shells was found in his trunk. In addition to the obstruction and weapons charges, Franke was charged with DUI (drugs) and no insurance. Bond was initially set at $50,000 and Franke was given a preliminary hearing date of Dec. 1. He entered a plea of not guilty. On Monday, an additional charge of armed violence was filed against Franke in Monroe County Circuit Court along with a petition to increase his bail to $500,000. The armed violence charge was added because Franke was armed with a dangerous weapon while also in possession of methamphetamine, the court filing states. The petition to increase bond motion was “to assure the defendant’s appearance in court and the safety of the community,” the filing states. In 2018, Franke was placed on probation and ordered to undergo psychological treatment following multiple incidents in Columbia that resulted in him being ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device and prohibited from coming into contact with multiple local families and entering school grounds. Franke was charged with felony stalking following an incident in the Country Crossings subdivision, after which he wrote a letter from jail containing language indicating he would “shoot up” a venue, later identifying Columbia High School specifically as a target. Prior to the stalking incident, Franke was arrested on Halloween after he allegedly chased several young trick-or-treaters while wearing a clown costume and carrying a steak knife in the same subdivision. 618-939-3814 205 West Mill St.Waterloo, IL 62298 news@republictimes.net © 2024 Republic-Times | News.

'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Austin Weekly News A news site committed to in-depth reporting on issues concerning the Austin neighborhood located on the West Side of Chicago, Illinois. A slate of new city, county and state laws in 2022 will affect education, criminal justice, deportation and eating out for Chicagoans. Schools no longer can crack down on nonwhite hairstyles, and they must do more to protect children from sexual misconduct. Chicago restaurants must stop offering pop as a default drink for kids’ meals and limit how much single-use plastics they give to customers ordering takeout. Here’s a closer look at 2022’s new laws: When 4-year-old Jett Hawkins came to his West Side school in March sporting braids, administrators told his mother the hairstyle violated a policy that banned several Black hairstyles, including locs, braids and cornrows on boys. Jett’s mother, Ida Nelson, pushed back, saying the experience of “policing Black children’s hair” can impact a child’s mental health, self-esteem and confidence. Such policies also encourage Black people “to assimilate to fit in with white culture and discard their history and their Black culture,” Nelson said. The story caught the attention of state Sen. Mike Simmons — who keeps his hair in long, freeform locs — who drafted the bill with the Illinois State Board of Education. The law requires the state board to complete a review of school handbooks and policies to ensure they don’t single out and ban Black hairstyles like cornrows, locs and braids. The law also directs the state board to produce educational resources for schools about hair discrimination, and the histories behind protective hairstyles Black people often use. Jett and his mom were on hand when Gov. JB Pritzker signed the Jett Hawkins’ Law in August. It goes into effect Jan. 1. With education upended for kids during the pandemic, public school students will be allowed mental health days for the first time. Starting in January, students 7-17 years old can take up to five mental health or behavioral days off per school year, with no doctor’s note required. The law, sponsored by state Sen. Robert Martwick, was signed by the governor in October. “Mental health challenges have risen dramatically,” Martwick said in a statement. “We need to ensure that our teachers and administrators have every tool they need to identify students who are suffering and ensure those students get the resources they need.” Starting in mid-January, Chicago restaurants can only give customers plasticware, napkins and similar items by request. The city ordinance, passed in September, bans restaurants from providing single-use utensils, stirrers, toothpicks, napkins, cup sleeves and disposable plates in most cases. Drive-thrus, airports and charity food giveaways would be exempt. The ordinance does not include straws, cup lids or takeout containers, and it does not apply to “self-service stations,” where customers can grab their own napkins or condiments. The ordinance is part of an effort to reduce waste of single-use plastics. Alderpeople who supported the final version of the law acknowledged it doesn’t go far enough, but said “small, incremental change” is needed now without overburdening restaurant owners. Portions of the Pretrial Fairness Act go into effect Jan. 1. While cash bail itself won’t go away until 2023, other parts of the law will expand the rights of people incarcerated in their homes on electronic monitoring. Those assigned house arrest as a condition of release will be allowed to leave their homes to perform essential tasks and receive regular reviews, allowing the court to evaluate whether they need to remain on electronic monitoring. Advocates long have argued that the cash bail system penalizes low-income defendants who have been approved to be released on bond but stay in jail because they cannot afford to pay. When the full law goes into effect in 2023, it will make it easier for defendants to help with their defense and support their families and communities, while still giving judges latitude to jail someone they think poses a threat to the public. “Being poor is not a crime, end of story,” said state Sen. Robert Peters, who sponsored the legislation. “Folks who have the means to cover their bail don’t spend a minute in jail, while others could be locked up for weeks or even months before their trial begins. This is not a just or equitable system.” As cash bail is removed, some neighborhood groups have mobilized to provide social services to people released from jail and awaiting trial. Faith’s Law was in the works for two years before it was signed as a massive sexual abuse scandal unfolded in Chicago Public Schools. Named for sexual abuse survivor Faith Colson, two parts of the law go into effect in July. First, it bans all forms of grooming in which adults lure children into sexual relationships. Previous state law defined grooming as luring a child into unlawful sex using the internet. Now, that definition has been expanded to include in-person interaction and written communication. The law also requires the state offer educator training “on the physical and mental health needs of students, student safety, educator ethics, professional conduct, and other topics that address the well-being of students and improve the academic and social-emotional outcomes of students” this year. The law was finalized in December amid the scandal at Marine Leadership Academy, 1920 N. Hamlin Ave. Investigators uncovered multiple instances of grooming, but CPS leaders said state law didn’t allow criminal charges because no sexual contact occurred with students until they were legal adults. Also under Faith’s Law, the Illinois State Board of Education is required to create a statewide resource guide for parents, “a centralized source of assistance and provide resources available to the parent or guardian of a student who is or may be the victim of sexual abuse,” according to the governor’s office. That must be complete by mid-2023. Starting in January, the Cook County Public Defenders Office can represent non-citizens in deportation cases under the Defenders For All Act. The Defenders for All coalition — a group of more than 40 organizations and community groups — pushed for the law and an immigration unit within the Public Defender’s Office dedicated to these cases. Cook County is the third jurisdiction, after San Francisco and Alameda County, California, to offer representation to immigrants facing deportation. The law moves Cook County closer to creating a more “welcoming place for everyone to call home,” county board President Toni Preckwinkle said. “We know individuals who go to immigration court without a lawyer are far more likely to get a worse outcome. Not because of some fact in their case, but solely because they don’t have a lawyer. … We want to change that,” Public Defender Sharone Mitchell said. The celebration of the effective end of slavery is now a paid state holiday. Juneteenth is celebrated June 19 to commemorate the day in 1865 when federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, to free all enslaved people two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation. Slavery was abolished through the 13th Amendment in December 1865. The holiday will be a paid day off for state workers and public education professionals, but only when June 19 falls on a weekday. That means the first paid holiday for Juneteenth will be in 2023. President Joe Biden also made Juneteenth a federal holiday. After initially ruling it out as too expensive, Mayor Lori Lightfoot reversed course and declared this year Juneteenth would be an official city holiday, as well. The Serve Kids Better Act, which goes into effect Jan 1, is part of a broader effort to cut down on sugary drinks. The law requires restaurants to offer water, juice or milk with no added sweeteners as the default option for a kids meal. Drinks like pop can still be ordered on request, but the primary options that are advertised must be some variety of water, milk or fruit or vegetable juice. The governor signed the law in August. Targeting someone for their citizenship or immigration status is now a hate crime in Illinois. Under the law signed in August, the state’s criminal code was expanded to specifically include anti-immigration bias as a hate crime, along with crimes based on race, age, gender, sexual orientation and other factors. The law was part of a slate of legislation designed to strengthen protections for immigrants and refugees. Two laws will expand what kids learn in school about various ethnic and religious groups. All public elementary and high schools must teach Asian-American history starting in 2022. That instruction must include lessons on Asian Americans in Illinois and in the Midwest and how Asian Americans advanced civil rights from the 19th century to today. Illinois became the first state to require Asian-American history instruction when Pritzker signed the law in July. Starting Jan. 1, United States history classes must also include instruction about how faith communities have shaped American society.

native of Skokie, will be heading to Illinois this month as a member of the United States Navy Band. The band will perform at three locations in the state, including West Leyden High School in Northlake at 7 p.m. on April 23. All Navy Band performances are free and open to the public.Percussionist DeRoche, who earned a Bachelor of Music and a Master of Music from DePaul University, and did advanced studies at the Cleveland Institute of Music, joined the Navy Band in 2015.“It’s widely known in the musical community that a military band is a great career progression for a musician,” DeRoche explained. “An opportunity came up and I auditioned and I got the spot. I play with extremely high-level musicians and I can serve my country while doing it.”There are six performing ensembles in the Navy Band. He performs with the Concert and Ceremonial Bands.DeRoche initially enlisted for four years, reenlisted for three more, and plans to continue to reenlist.The band is based in Washington D.C. but they tour the country 12 to15 weeks each year. They are equally busy when they’re not touring.“We have a wide variety of missions and jobs,” DeRoche noted. “Our job is really split up into two segments. The first half is ceremonial. Ceremonies are an important part of military culture. Our most solemn mission is providing funeral support at Arlington National Cemetery.”The second part of their job is performing concerts. “We do 300 public concerts a year,” the percussionist reported. “When we’re not on tour, they’re largely in the Washington D.C. region. “Our mission is to connect the public with our Navy in ways they wouldn’t otherwise be able to connect.”Chief Musician Sarah Blecker, added, “One of the biggest things that we really like to do with every concert is end with a salute to veterans. We do a medley of all of the service songs. We have the veterans stand up and we salute and honor them and thank them for their service. It’s a big part of what we do and a big part of why we go on the road. To honor the veterans and to bring communities together through the music.”DeRoche began studying music when he was growing up in Skokie.“I was very involved with my middle school and high school music programs,” he said. “I went to McCracken Middle School and Niles North High School.

Housed on Medill’s Chicago campus, it will collaborate with news outlets in the Chicago area and provide them with research and expertise on audience engagement and financial strategy. Medill Prof. Tim Franklin, who leads two existing Medill-based local news support programs in the Local News Initiative and the Metro Media Lab, said the accelerator will allow journalists to work long-term with Medill researchers and faculty. “This is a critical moment in time when local news organizations need (research and development) help, and they need the kind of expertise and tools that Medill is uniquely positioned to provide,” Franklin said. Medill Dean Charles Whitaker said the accelerator seeks to support news organizations holistically by enhancing content creation and focusing on business aspects of the news industry. Medill is also developing an immersive program with the Kellogg School of Management and outside experts to train Chicago media leaders in managing their publications, he added. “I think it’s important for an institution like Medill to not simply be a training ground for the next generation of journalists and storytellers,” Whitaker said, “but to also insert ourselves in the media ecosystem in an effort to try to cure what’s ailing local news.” Though the accelerator is currently in the planning stages, Whitaker said Medill has formed a faculty working group and expects to hire a program director in the coming weeks. The accelerator donation is not the first time the McCormick Foundation has funded local news through Medill. In 2020, the Foundation also contributed $1 million to launch the Metro Media Lab. The Metro Media Lab organizes yearlong partnerships with news outlets. Franklin said its newest cohort of partners includes the Evanston RoundTable, Wednesday Journal, The TRiiBE and McKinley Park News. The lab has collaborated with the publications on audience behavior research, search engine optimization and newsletter development. The success of the Metro Media Lab helped Medill secure the second grant from the McCormick Foundation last month, Franklin said. Andrés Torres, director of strategy, planning and operations for the McCormick Foundation, said the group is particularly interested in researching sustainable business models for local news organizations. “Medill has really taken a deeper interest and made a deeper investment in local news,” Torres said. “This (grant) is a way to build on that higher interest and extend that investment, so it can continue to benefit not just local outlets, but (also) the communities and consumers that they serve.” Franklin said aiding area outlets has broad implications. Research has shown a lack of local news contributes to increased government spending and a drop in civil participation and voter turnout in local elections, he said. Medill’s range of data scientists and experienced faculty can help tackle these issues, he added. “I think Medill is unique in the country in the resources and the expertise it has,” Franklin said. “We want to provide new insights through research that leads to action.” Email: [email protected] Twitter: @caseeey_he Related Stories: — McCormick Foundation donates $2.4 million to Medill local news program — Medill receives $1 million grant from McCormick Foundation to support local news — Northwestern starts local news initiative in partnership with 3 newspapers Sign up to receive our email newsletter in your inbox.'}]"

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 6:59 pm Today is Friday, Sept. 30, the 273rd day of 2022. There are 92 days left in the year. Today’s Highlight in History: On Sept. 30, 1777, the Continental Congress — forced to flee in the face of advancing British forces — moved to York, Pennsylvania. On this date: In 1791, Mozart’s opera “The Magic Flute” premiered in Vienna, Austria. In 1938, after co-signing the Munich Agreement allowing Nazi annexation of Czechoslovakia’s Sudetenland, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said, “I believe it is peace for our time.” In 1947, the World Series was broadcast on television for the first time; the New York Yankees defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers 5-3 in Game 1 (the Yankees went on to win the Series four games to three). In 1949, the Berlin Airlift came to an end. In 1954, the first nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Nautilus, was commissioned by the U.S. Navy. In 1955, actor James Dean, 24, was killed in a two-car collision near Cholame, California. In 1960, “The Flintstones,” network television’s first animated prime-time series, debuted on ABC. In 1962, James Meredith, a Black student, was escorted by federal marshals to the campus of the University of Mississippi, where he enrolled for classes the next day; Meredith’s presence sparked rioting that claimed two lives. In 1972, Roberto Clemente hit a double against Jon Matlack of the New York Mets during Pittsburgh’s 5-0 victory at Three Rivers Stadium; the hit was the 3,000th and last for the Pirates star. In 1986, the U.S. released accused Soviet spy Gennadiy Zakharov, one day after the Soviets released American journalist Nicholas Daniloff. In 1988, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev retired President Andrei A. Gromyko from the Politburo and fired other old-guard leaders in a Kremlin shake-up. In 2001, under threat of U.S. military strikes, Afghanistan’s hard-line Taliban rulers said explicitly for the first time that Osama bin Laden was still in the country and that they knew where his hideout was located. Ten years ago: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, writing in The Wall Street Journal, said President Barack Obama had “misunderstood” American values in his policies toward other countries. Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels became the first rookie in Major League history to hit 30 home runs and steal 40 bases in a season as the Angels defeated the Texas Rangers 5-4. Five years ago: President Donald Trump lashed out at the mayor of San Juan and other officials in storm-ravaged Puerto Rico, saying they “want everything to be done for them.” Monty Hall, the long-running host of TV’s “Let’s Make a Deal,” died of heart failure at his home in Beverly Hills at the age of 96. One year ago: With only hours to spare, Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed legislation to avoid a partial federal shutdown and keep the government funded through Dec. 3. A 22-year-old white supremacist, John Earnest, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for bursting into a Southern California synagogue on the last day of Passover in 2019 with a semiautomatic rifle, killing one worshipper and wounding three others. Government researchers reported a big decline in teen vaping in 2021 as many U.S. students were forced to learn from home during the pandemic. Today’s Birthdays: Actor Angie Dickinson is 91. Singer Cissy Houston is 89. Singer Johnny Mathis is 87. Actor Len Cariou is 83. Singer Marilyn McCoo is 79. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is 77.

Former Scott County Republican Party Chair Dave Millage said it\'s time for Republicans to accept the results of the 2020 election in an interview with CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota May 3, 2021. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday he will oppose legislation to create a commission on the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, a blow to Democrats who say an independent, bipartisan investigation of the siege is crucial to prevent it from happening again. The reaction by local Republicans to last year\'s attack on the U.S. Capitol largely reflected divisions in the party nationally. While many members of the GOP continue to support former president Donald Trump, others resent his influence, especially related to the insurrection. Dave Millage was chairman of the Scott County Republican Party on Jan. 6, 2021, and instantly was appalled by the violence that erupted at the capitol. ""I was working at Republican headquarters that day. I sat there dumbfounded,"" he said this week. ""Another person in the office that day was also watching and said, \'This needed to happen.\' ""Republicans are supposed to be the party of law and order."" Until he got the text message Wednesday afternoon, the sheriff had no idea his congresswoman… By the following day, Millage had called for Trump\'s impeachment. ""I got about 20 notes from people who were glad I stood up and asked, \'When are we going to take the party back?\'"" he said. ""There were more people who were upset. ""Those who were upset wanted me to apologize. That\'s why I resigned."" Millage left the county chairmanship, which he already planned to do when his term was set to expire the following month. He doesn\'t regret it. ""To have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump, that\'s what they\'re going to need,"" he said. ""He\'s a cancer to the party. I\'m still partisan. I\'m still a Republican. ""I was appalled by what occurred on 1-6, and I couldn\'t believe everyone else wasn\'t appalled."" Millage\'s counterpart in Rock Island County, Republican Party Chairman Drue Mielke, referred to those who attacked the capitol as ""terrorists."" He said it was ""infiltrators, possibly antifa,"" that were responsible. Short for “anti-fascists,” antifa is a group of far-left-leaning activists who endorse peaceful political protest as well as confrontation against racism. A year later, Mielke continues to deny the direct involvement of Trump supporters in the siege. While more than 700 people have been identified and charged with breaching the capitol and with other crimes, Mielke maintains he hasn\'t seen connections between those people and the former president. ""I want to know who those 725 people are,"" he said. ""Do we know they\'re not antifa? I don\'t know that."" In the weeks following the riot, the FBI directly denied the conspiracy theory and said there was ""no indication"" that antifa was involved. Some of those who have been charged have specifically indicated in court that they took part in the attack at the behest of the former president. It appeared from Mielke\'s comments the day after the insurrection that he was aware that Trump supporters had likely led the charge. In response to Millage\'s call for impeachment, Mielke said, ""If we want to divide the country and anger the Trump supporters more, then that\'s what we should do."" In addition to denying the role of Trump or his supporters in the January 6 attack, Mielke also continues to bolster the belief some supporters had legitimate election-related grounds to lash out. He said, ""there was a lot of voter fraud,"" especially in DuPage County, Illinois, and in Georgia. But he said he and other Rock Island County Republicans do not endorse the claims by others in the party that the election was stolen. ""I\'m not working on the 2020 election; we have a new election to win,"" he said this week. ""My solution has always been to work toward reform."" However, Mielke continued to assert there was widespread voter fraud in 2020. When asked for specific instances in which fraud has been proven, he said, ""I can\'t go into detail now. ""I\'m not drinking the Kool-Aid. I\'m just saying it\'s a concern."" For Millage, the repeatedly disproved stolen-election theories that continue to circulate in his party are another reason to discredit the former president. ""I think Trump has succeeded in brainwashing people into thinking the election was stolen,"" he said. ""Four dead people voted in Georgia. That doesn\'t change the outcome."" The two local Republicans agree on one aspect of the capitol riots: An investigation should have followed, but the January 6 commission as it stands is a partisan body with partisan intent. Two Republicans sit on the commission, including Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who represents Illinois\' 16th Congressional district. ""It\'s become a Democrat witch hunt,"" Millage said. However, Millage said he is relieved that an increasing number of other Republicans now are willing to acknowledge the riot at the capitol complex took place, which has been widely denied. ""The problem is, people are still trying to sweep it under the rug,"" he said. ""(The attack) has dimmed in the memory. We haven\'t learned anything, even though Trump\'s been a crook all his life."" Mielke said some of the rioters may have been Trump supporters, but that doesn\'t make them Republicans. ""Some are viewed as radicalized,"" he said. ""Those people were acting out of anger. Our party doesn\'t act out of anger."" Mielke Subscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.

leads the way as most important to today’s homebuyers as seen by record-sales at Heritage Harbor resort in Ottawa. OTTAWA, IL (June 15, 2020)-For decades desirability real estate has been driven by the three ‘L’s - location, location, location. However, research suggests, that post pandemic buyers have redefined the three ‘L’s in home buying to - lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle. According to Better Homes and Gardens recent Real Estate Report, ‘lifestyle leads the way for today’s buyers’. The report goes on to say that buyers have reevaluated what their ‘dream home’ is putting more emphasis on the quality of life a particular community or area offers and less on the perceived desirability of a location. “We’ve experienced record-setting sales in the past 24 months with buyers leaving densely populated areas wanting to live a resort life year-round,” said Pierre Alexander, Heritage Harbor Resort Marketing Manager. “The harbor, marina, walking trails, bike paths, kayaking, proximity to Starved Rock State Park and more give buyers a daily quality of life they only thought came with vacationing or retiring.” Situated along the Illinois River and featuring a state-of-the-art 182-slip marina, Heritage Harbor offers several distinct neighborhoods, including villas, cottages, low-maintenance single-family homes and luxury, custom residences.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:11 pm Editor MONTICELLO — For Andrea Lively, her morning on Feb. 9 began like most weekdays when she dropped her daughter off at Monticello High School at about 8 a.m. As she drove off — heading to her job in Urbana — she saw something unusual out of the corner of her eye, about a block from the high school. “I looked over briefly, and I thought ‘is that smoke?’ I thought it might have been somebody’s chimney. So I just had that nagging feeling. I went around and came back up Independence,” Lively said. When she arrived at the corner of South Independence and Bond Streets, she saw smoke billowing out of the roof of a one-story home. “So I pulled my car over, got out and called 9-1-1,” Lively said. The quick action might have helped save the life of the person who was inside the home when the fire began. Monticello police officers Jason Shumard and DeJuante Forman, the first to arrive after Lively’s 9-1-1 call, helped him exit the burning home. The man was taken to the hospital, where he was treated for smoke inhalation. One pet survived, but another could not get out and died in the fire. The home is a complete loss, but the occupant got out safe and four fire departments were able to contain the blaze to the one residential lot. “It was pretty much engulfed,” Monticello Fire Chief John Rupkey said. “It was coming out the windows.” Firemen could not go inside due to the extensive flames and collapsing ceilings and walls, so battled it from outside and on the roof. The garage and a portion of the home still stood after the fire, but Rupkey said early indications are that the house will be a complete loss. A State Fire Marshall deemed the cause of the blaze undetermined at this time, Rupkey added. The Monticello fire chief was proud of not only his firemen and others from Bement, Cisco and Mid-Piatt who also responded, but to city crews who chipped in, most of whom have firefighter training. “I was extremely grateful to the City of Monticello public works for their hard work, manpower and equipment in helping us control and extinguish the fire,” which included a backhoe bringing down hot walls and roofs to prevent further spread. “We couldn’t have done it without them,” Rupkey said, naming city workers Bart Baker, Brett Baker and Trevor Mohr. Also responding was the Kirby Ambulance Service. Emergency Management Agency Director Rob Bross was also on hand, and Monticello Subway brought lunch to the scene, which was manned by firefighters for about five hours. A Cerro Gordo Fire volunteer brought Gatorade. Lively was impressed by the work done by the city police officers. “They were so brave. They just went right to it. I know if it were my house, that’s exactly the kind of guys I would want helping. They just took action,” she said. Police Chief John Carter said it is part of their training, pointing out that squad cars also carry a “cold fire” product that can put out smaller fires. “So really, we try to reduce the risk to life and property when we show up.

An additional $834,000 will be allocated toward improving existing senior housing.A total of $450,000 in ambulance transport fees for the next two fiscal years will go toward the police and fire pension funds, split equally between the two. These payments are being made in addition to the village’s statutorily required contribution. Though the Tuesday meeting included a public hearing, only one resident, Tony Riccardi, spoke at public comment.Riccardi, who identified himself as a lifetime resident of the village, expressed concern on Northbrook’s long-term appeal in light of rising operating expenses and several developments backed by the village like Northbrook Court. He also alluded to “rumors, court documents and messages” that led him to question village officials’ integrity, though he did not elaborate.“I would like to know how residents are to entrust our village leadership to be fiscally responsible,” Riccardi said.Trustees also gave their cursory approval to the Northbrook Library’s $9.8 million budget, a 1.9 % decrease from last year after the library spent less than its 2021-22 projections. The library is expected to increase its levy by 2.5 % this year; library trustees approved the change and the complete budget in March.Joshua Irvine is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press. The village General Fund will grow 10 % from this fiscal year’s estimate to $48.5 million, with an expected surplus of $46,000 by next April.

promoting our overall health, such as boosting our happiness and reducing our stress. Friends increase our sense of belonging and purpose and keep us mentally and physically strong by helping us make better lifestyle choices and lowering our likelihood of depression. Friends help us through traumatic times, especially in times of divorce, loss of a job or the death of a loved one. In fact, when you are in a crisis you will discover who your true friends are, for in the words of Walter Winchell, “a friend is one who walks in when others walk out.” Having positive friends can lower our blood pressure, improve our attitude, and help us rebound from health issues or disease more quickly. Of course, the reverse is possible if we do not choose our friends wisely. True friends know the real us and offer their friendship anyway, they lift us up when no one else even noticed we were down. Real friends are the ones who make our problems disappear, instead of adding to them or abandon us. True friends are like diamonds, they are real and rare, but to attract such friends, we must be that sort of friend as well. Developing and maintaining good friendships takes effort. We cannot neglect nurturing our existing relationships, but we should always be open to making new friends throughout our lives, primarily because our responsibilities and priorities change. In the early years we are raising families and trying to advance our careers, later we are caring for our aging parents, preparing for, or entering our retirement. At each stage of our life, we encounter changes that may cause some of our friends to grow apart, while we form friendships with others with mutual interests and/or similar lifestyles. It is never too late to develop new friendships. Friendships make life more enjoyable, and life is better when shared with friends. But while it’s great to have a large and diverse group of friends, some are only acquaintances, such as classmates, neighbors, or coworkers. True friends experience a stronger bond between one another, an on-going relationship, a mutual affection, a genuine concern which goes deeper than an acquaintance. Quantity means little next to the quality of one solid and authentic friend, whom you can trust completely. A true friend is someone who you can connect with no matter what the distance. Their friendship multiplies our happiness by doubling our joys and diminishes our suffering by dividing our sorrows. Good friends will show us how to forgive, laugh, and befriend others. We learn more about ourselves and the importance of having someone who understands us. A friend keeps us from feeling as though we are alone or at odds with the world. We should take time to maintain true friendships and to determine whether we are giving them our best in return. As I write this column, I must mention that occasionally friendships are severed, either amicably or otherwise. It’s always difficult but friendships that are negative or do not add value to your life should be allowed to fade. Life changes as do many valued friendships along the way. However, maintaining an unhealthy friendship is just a bad use of time and energy. Years ago, a person, who I thought more like a sister than a friend, devastated me by allowing a falsehood to persist. I thought sure she would defend me for I felt she knew it was untrue and the pain it caused me. As I write this column, I realize she was never my friend. We were more like competitors than friends, each a tad jealous of the other. The incident was insurmountable. I should have seen it much earlier, however now, (better late than never) I can finally put the hurt behind me, for I can’t lose a friend I never had. I should also mention that many romantic relationships start out as friendships. If a person is a poor friend, how could they ever be a good marriage partner?

email newsletters eNewspaper Trending: The Arlington Heights, Buffalo Grove and Lake Zurich police departments have collectively donated 60 retired ballistic vests to Ukraine as the nation continues its combat effort after being invaded by Russia.Russia attacked the Ukraine just over a month ago, leaving more than a thousand people dead and even more wounded, according to data provided by the United Nations, and causing millions of Ukrainians to leave their country.A call by the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police was heeded by the three police departments, and each recently made donations of protective equipment to the war-torn nation.Arlington Heights police Chief Nick Pecora said his department donated 40 bulletproof vests, most of them formerly used for the department’s Citizen Police Academy. Although the academy recently restarted after a pause during the COVID-19 pandemic, he said equipment can no longer be shared, as a result.“All of the retired vests are stockpiled and we asked our officers if they have a retired vest,” Pecora said, noting there was a collection receptacle at the station.The vests from the Arlington Heights Police Department were collected and shipped March 25 to a logistics company in Carol Stream that will handle shipping them to Poland, Pecora said. Police recognized the donation on the department’s Facebook page. In March 2022, the Arlington Heights Police Department donated several bulletproof vests to be used by Ukrainians fighting in the war against Russia. The donation was made following a request from the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police.“We’re supporting that endeavor and shipping vests to Poland to be delivered to the fighting residents of the Ukraine,” Pecora said.He said the vests, which each cost $885 new, only have a five-year manufacturer warranty before they are retired. Pecora said his department has field tested the retired vests. “They do stop bullets,” he said. “They do work.”The donation, Pecora said, was spurred by a personal email he received from a colleague at the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police.According to a March 7 announcement on the IACP website, retired Mokena police Chief Steven Vaccaro, whose sister has close ties to Ukraine, asked police agencies around the state for donations of ballistic vests to help the people in Ukraine defend their country.Vaccaro’s sister, Jennifer Doloski, and her husband adopted three boys from Ukraine in 2012 through an agency Doloski now works for stateside.
