CLAIR, Mo. (Gray News) – The former Missouri teacher who made headlines for having an OnlyFans account said she has made nearly $1 million on the platform since she joined it over the summer. Former teacher Brianna Coppage revealed to Fox News the staggering amount of money she has made from making adult content. Coppage had been a teacher for five years, spending the last two at St. Clair High School as an English teacher before resigning after her OnlyFans page was discovered by school administrators and she was put on leave. Coppage noted that her annual teaching salary was $42,000, and she originally started the OnlyFans account to help pay off her student loans. “Missouri is one of the lowest states in the nation for teacher pay,” Coppage told KMOV. “The district I was working for is also one of the lowest paying districts in the state. I feel like times are tough. I have student loans. I have multiple degrees in education, and it would be helpful for extra money.” On Coppage’s teaching salary, she would have had to work for nearly 24 years to make the same amount of money she has made from OnlyFans in less than six months. Coppage said she now has tens of thousands of subscribers on OnlyFans and has “far exceeded” her teaching salary for the year. She has also paid off all her debt. “I’ve been able to pay off all my student loans, any car loans, any credit card debt. I have no debt now, and that’s really freeing,” Coppage told KMOV. “Being a teacher, I know I never would have been able to fully pay all of that off.” Although her OnlyFans account posts sexually explicit content, Coppage said she avoided showing her face because of her job as a teacher. Coppage’s OnlyFans content was originally discovered by the St. Clair School District after a link to the page was posted in a St. Clair Facebook group. Once the page gained so much attention in the community and even across the country, Coppage said she knew she couldn’t go back to the classroom and decided to resign. Coppage said her content was never advertised to her high school students, but adults in the community continue to bring up the subject. “I’m not advertising it to students, but adults in the community continue to do so,” Coppage told KMOV. “I just don’t think that’s OK. Students were never meant to see this. I know people are saying, ‘You taught high school. They were bound to find it at some point.’ Maybe. I was faceless. I did not use my real name.” While Coppage said she will miss her students and has grieved her career as a teacher, she doesn’t have any regrets. Coppage said if teachers are held to a high standard, she wants to see them paid accordingly. She also told Fox News she strongly believes people are allowed to have personal lives outside of their careers. Copyright 2023 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.'}]"

They said their “extraordinary” request befits this extraordinary case. Sign up for WPR’s email newsletter. “Nothing could be more vital to our democracy than that a President who abuses the electoral system to remain in office is held accountable for criminal conduct,” the special counsel lawyers wrote. They’re asking the Supreme Court to consider a fundamental question at the “heart” of American democracy: whether a former president is completely immune from federal prosecution for crimes he commits in office, or whether he deserves constitutional protection if he has been impeached but not convicted before criminal proceedings commence. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan dismissed those arguments from Trump, who lodged an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. But the Justice Department wants the high court to take the case and weigh in since it will be the ultimate authority. A significant delay might mean the high court wouldn’t consider the case this term. And Trump allies have suggested if he regains the White House, he might direct his new Justice Department leaders to dismiss the charges or attempt to pardon himself. In its 81-page petition, the federal government pointed out the Supreme Court expedited a review of another landmark case involving executive authority, a clash over access to White House tapes in United States v. Nixon, back in 1974. The court heard and decided that case within two months, the special counsel team said. In another case that dates to the Nixon era, the high court found presidents have a measure of immunity from civil claims if they relate to the “outer perimeter” of their official duties. And the Justice Department has said for decades that a sitting president can’t be indicted by the federal government while he’s in the White House. But that doesn’t put a former president beyond the long arm of U.S. criminal law, the government said. “It is of imperative public importance that respondent’s claims of immunity be resolved by this Court and that respondent’s trial proceed as promptly as possible if his claim of immunity is rejected,” Smith’s team wrote. Trump, who has pleaded not guilty to four felony charges related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, has sought to delay all four criminal cases against him in D.C., Florida, Georgia and New York. “As President Trump has said over and over again, this prosecution is completely politically motivated,” a Trump spokesman said in a written statement late Monday. “There is absolutely no reason to rush this sham to trial except to injure President Trump and tens of millions of his supporters. President Trump will continue to fight for Justice and oppose these authoritarian tactics.” The high court petition is signed by the special counsel himself because he has authority to litigate before the Supreme Court as part of his job.

Included in that complaint is the GOP’s decision to block 27 projects that requested funding through the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program, which was created in 1989 to preserve Wisconsin’s natural resources. The Nature Conservancy – or TNC – , a global organization that uses science to promote conservation efforts, registered their support for the Governor’s lawsuit. Alex Madorsky is the Associate Director of Government Relations at TNC’s Wisconsin chapter. He shared some insight on the Stewardship Program and the Governor’s lawsuit with WORT News Producer Faye Parks earlier today. He says that the Stewardship’s grant approval process, which used to run smoothly, is now rife with roadblocks. Lawmakers can anonymously block any project – for any reason – without disclosing their reasoning. Right now, he estimates that at least a third of all project proposals are blocked and often don’t receive public hearings. Image courtesy: Steve S.

The layoffs are in addition to the 2,500 job cuts 3M announced earlier this year. The Minnesota-based company plans to reduce its workforce by around 10 percent. 3M CEO Mike Roman said on an earnings call that the layoffs “will span all functions, businesses and geographies.” The layoffs will reduce costs by up to $900 million annually. 3M, which manufactures a wide range of products including N95 respirators and Post-it notes, pointed to “significant weakness in consumer electronics and consumer retail.” The company plans to invest in industrial automation as part of its effort to boost factory productivity. 3M said it will focus on “high growth markets” such as electric vehicles, personal safety, home improvement, microchips and health care. 3M noted that a decline in demand for respirators hurt its sales. The company’s withdrawal from Russia also took a toll on its finances. Tuesday’s announcement is yet another indication that the U.S. economy is slowing and American workers will be impacted. Demand for goods exploded during the pandemic as Americans stayed home more often. But consumers have increasingly shifted their spending toward services like travel and restaurants. When accounting for inflation, consumer spending is down 2 percent since last year, according to Census Bureau data released earlier this month. The report noted huge drops in spending at gas stations, general stores, electronics retailers and furniture stores. The spending shift, in addition to unsnarled supply chains, has led to a rapid slowdown in manufacturing. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s index of manufacturing activity slipped in April, capping off months of substantial declines, amid falling shipments and new orders.

Entertainment Politics Politics Politics Politics Politics Entertainment Politics Entertainment Politics Sports Politics Politics Politics Politics Politics Published on By MILWAUKEE (AP) — President Joe Biden touted his administration’s support for minority-owned businesses and the replacement of lead pipes during a Milwaukee visit Wednesday, while also swiping at Donald Trump’s rhetoric toward migrants and his ongoing lies about his election loss. The trip showed how Biden is trying to juggle multiple political priorities in the critical battleground state of Wisconsin. Democrats want to generate excitement among nonwhite voters who are an important part of their coalition while also keeping the focus on Trump’s extremism, heightening a contrast that the White House hopes will secure a second term for Biden. The Democratic president’s first stop upon arriving in Milwaukee was Hero Plumbing, which has replaced hundreds of lead pipes around the city. The work is part of a $15 billion nationwide initiative funded through bipartisan infrastructure legislation. “Not only has our business grown, but we’re helping to save our community,” said the company’s owner, Rashawn Spivey. Spivey rode with Biden to the Wisconsin Black Chamber of Commerce, where the president highlighted the pipe replacement program. He’s described it as a generation-changing opportunity to create good-paying union jobs while reducing brain-damaging exposure to lead in schools, childcare centers and more than 9 million U.S. homes that draw water from lead pipes. “This is the United States of America, for God’s sake,” Biden said. “Everyone should be able to turn on a faucet and know whatever they drink is clean and pure and not have to worry about it.” Biden also focused on his administration’s surge in federal assistance for minority-owned businesses and distressed communities, saying, “We’re leaving no one behind.” The Small Business Administration in the last fiscal year backed 4,700 loans valued at $1.5 billion to Black-owned businesses. Under Biden, the SBA said it has more than doubled the number and total dollar amount of loans to Black-owned small businesses. The share of the SBA’s loans going to minority-owned businesses has increased from 23% to over 32% since 2020. Under Trump, Biden said “minority-owned businesses found themselves last in line,” and he accused political opponents of a “full-on attack on Black economic opportunity” Biden also criticized Trump for his recent comments that migrants were “poisoning the blood” of the country. “I don’t believe, as the former president said again yesterday, that immigrants are polluting our blood,” Biden said. “The economy and our nation are stronger when we tap into the full range of talents in this nation.” The trip to Wisconsin came one day after the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump was ineligible for the ballot there. The decision, the first of its kind in U.S. history, will likely be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Biden said it was “self-evident” that Trump is an insurrectionist. However, he did not comment on the ruling itself. “Whether the 14th Amendment applies or not, we’ll let the court make that decision,” Biden told reporters on the tarmac after stepping off Air Force One in Milwaukee. “But he certainly supported an insurrection. There’s no question about it. None. Zero. And he seems to be doubling down on it.” Trump has refused to back down from his lies that voter fraud cost him the 2020 election, and he’s pledged to pardon Jan. 6 rioters. Biden’s campaign was circumspect when asked about the Colorado ruling in a call with reporters. “What I will say is that the president looks forward to defeating Donald Trump or whoever else emerges from the Republican primary on the ballot box in November 2024,” said Brooke Goren, the campaign’s deputy communications director. Wisconsin was among the most competitive states in Biden’s 2020 election win over Trump Trump and will likely be key to his reelection hopes in 2024. Trump is the leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination, and the party is hosting its national convention in Milwaukee next year. In Wisconsin and beyond, Biden is trying to pep up American voters at a time when polls show people are largely dour about his handling of the economy. The president is struggling with poor approval ratings on the economy even as the unemployment rate hovers near historic lows and as inflation has plummeted in little over a year from 9.1% to 3.2%.

For almost a year now, the town has been trying to come to a resolution with the Lac du Flambeau Tribe. After 10 years of unpaid easements, the Tribe barricaded four roads for several weeks starting in January. It blocked access to private homes of non-tribal members. Throughout the year, there’s been lawsuits and negotiations. The latest offer from the Tribe came December 1. Tribal President John Johnson Sr. said the tribe is demanding nearly $10 million to resolve past trespass damage. Here is the breakdown he stated in the letter: - $2,885,370 for the 10-year Settlement for Annie Sunn Lane, Center Sugarbush Lane, East Ross Allen Lake Lane, and Elsie Lake Lane. - $3, 448,843 for the Big Thunder Settlement for East Ross for 31 years - $140,000 for legal fees related to negotiations - $183,507 for Pollard v.

The Lac du Flambeau town board met in closed session for more than two hours Wednesday to discuss the letter. When they returned to open session, town chairman Matt Gaulke said there was no formal action to be taken. “But we do want to let people know that the board feels that this is no longer just a local issue. The town will be contacting its state and federal representatives and urge them to get involved to seek a resolution,” said Gaulke. State and federal representatives have commented and tried to get involved in the past year without much success. In February, while the barricades were still up, Governor Evers met with the Tribal president. He called the meeting productive, though no resolution came from it. In May, Evers and Senator Tammy Baldwin issued a letter expressing their disappointment that the town and Tribe had yet to come to a resolution and urged them to use a mediator. Less than a month later, Senator Ron Johnson and Congressman Tom Tiffany expressed similar frustrations with the lack of resolutions. More recently, State Senator Mary Felzkowski sent a letter to the Tribal president requesting communication with him on the issue. It was after the Joint Finance Committee withheld one million dollars in Tribal gaming funds from the Lac du Flambeau Tribe. President Johnson responded to her letter calling the JFC’s actions discriminatory and saying, in part, “We are going to work to right the wrongs of the past and will no longer tolerate abuse of our people or our land.” The town of Lac du Flambeau has been paying the tribe on a monthly basis for road permits on four roads. Most recently, the town was issued a permit on December 8th at the cost of $34,000. It will keep the roads open until January 12.'}]"

JUNEAU COUNTY (WKOW) - Investigators are using new methods to solve what is arguably the biggest unsolved mystery in Juneau County. It surrounds the disappearance of 4-year-old Ricky Jean Bryant who went missing from her home in rural Juneau County in 1949. Detective Shaun Goyette with the Juneau County Sheriff\'s Office was assigned the case in 2009. ""I\'m just looking for that right piece of the puzzle to try to put it together,"" he said. Goyette said the fire broke out on December 19, 1949 at a farm home about three miles northeast of Mauston. The home was being rented by the Bryant\'s, a family of six. ""There was other siblings that are a little older that do recall that Ricky Jean was out of the structure,"" Goyette explained. A lot of different theories of what happened after the fire exist. Newspaper clippings from 1949 show Ricky Jean died inside the home. However, human remains were never found. Witnesses then shared a key detail leading investigators to believe Ricky Jean may have been taken. ""They recall that a lady, in a nice car and a dress that was really nice, showed up and sent Ricky Jean\'s brother to another residence to get help,"" Goyette said. ""When he returned, the lady in the nice car and Ricky Jean were gone."" The search for the little girl began. After officials didn\'t find human remains inside the home and Ricky Jean wasn\'t located, another theory was formed. ""There was information that possibly there was connection to Minnesota,"" Goyette added. The information pointed to Ricky Jeans mother. ""Ricky Jean\'s mom once a year would disappear at some point and they believe that she was going to Minnesota to possibly visit Ricky Jean,"" he said. He said they have since interviewed people and followed up on leads. ""This lady in the nice dress and the nice car, we don\'t know who that was,"" he said. ""This Minnesota connection, we don\'t know who to follow up with or where to go."" Goyette said every answer they get is followed by another question and the age of the case makes solving it difficult. ""A lot of the people that may have information, unfortunately, aren\'t alive anymore,"" Goyette added. Their most recent effort to crack the case involves genealogy. ""We are doing some genealogy, potentially with some of the family, she does have one surviving sister,"" he explained. ""We\'ve been trying to see what we can dig up and maybe she [Ricky Jean] was living in another area or she had unanswered questions and maybe she did the same thing [genealogy searches]."" Goyette said every few years someone comes forward wondering if they could be Ricky Jean. They haven\'t had any hits on geology so far but Goyette is staying hopeful. ""Maybe the right person sees the information or they have unanswered questions from their childhood,"" he said. ""And maybe they are Ricky Jean or they just have that little piece that might point us in the right direction."" In the meantime, Goyette has his own theories of what happened that December afternoon. ""I believe she made it out of the fire and I believe she was picked up from the residence,"" he said. ""Where she went from there - we just don\'t have any answers to those questions."" The cause of the fire was never determined. Ricky Jean would be about 78-years-old today. Her parents and two of her siblings have since died. Goyette said there was speculation that Ricky Jean may have not been biologically related to her siblings and that could have been why she was taken. However, he said they have not been able to confirm or deny that. The original missing person\'s report filed in 1949 was lost in a flood at the sheriff\'s department. A second report was filed in the early 2000\'s. Goyette said despite so many years going by, the case remains very active and far from being called a cold case. He\'s asking people to think back to that time or stories they may have heard over the years and contact officials with even the smallest information that could lead to Ricky Jean.

They could make painful cuts — laying off staff, closing schools. Or, they could go to voters to ask for more property tax funding. That means in 2024, Wisconsinites may see more school referendums on their ballots. We also want to look back on some of the good education news of 2023. Higher education has been expanding in Wisconsin prisons, with the goal of giving incarcerated men and women better opportunities once they are released. Colleges are looking to expand behind bars even more in 2024 and beyond, due to the restoration of the federal Pell grant to incarcerated students. College classes have also been growing in high schools, through dual enrollment. The classes are meant to encourage more students to attend college, and to save them money if they do enroll. And, starting in 2024, the UW System will start a direct admissions program, where it admits high school seniors to its universities based on GPA and course completion, without the need for a college application. _'}]"

cryptocurrencies are staging a big recovery. Crypto had been rocked since the collapse of several major companies in 2022, including FTX, which had become one of its biggest and best recognized players. Its failure deepened a so-called “crypto winter” that sent bitcoin to around $16,500, a sharp decline from its record high of around $68,000 on Nov. 8, 2021. Sign up for WPR’s email newsletter. But something remarkable has happened since FTX CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted in November: bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have staged an impressive comeback. Bitcoin, for example, has surged to above $43,000. “There has been tumult,” says Helen Gugel, a partner at the law firm Ropes & Gray. “But I think that there is also reason for optimism.” Here’s a look at crypto’s turbulent period — and why things appear to be looking better. It was a blockbuster trial — and it ended badly for Bankman-Fried. He was convicted of all seven charges he was facing, marking a stunning fall from grace for someone who was once heralded as “crypto’s golden boy.” Bankman-Fried now faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison. Then, just weeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced a major plea deal with another crypto giant as part of a continued crackdown of the sector by regulators and law enforcement. Under the settlement, Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines, while its founder, Changpeng Zhao, widely known as CZ, relinquished his CEO title and pleaded guilty to violating anti-money-laundering laws. He also agreed to pay a $50 million fine. Bankman-Fried’s conviction and regulators’ pledge to continue to crack down on an industry they see as rife with fraud could have been seen as a negative spotlight on an entire industry. Instead, many crypto advocates saw this moment as a good thing — a moment when confidence in crypto could return now that prominent bad actors had been weeded out Cryptocurrencies surged soon after Bankman-Fried’s conviction, and the survivors of the crypto winter also benefited: Shares of Coinbase, another major cryptocurrency exchange that is under regulatory scrutiny, are up more than 400% this year. There’s another critical reason behind crypto’s comeback. This year, several prominent financial firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a spot bitcoin ETF. Exchange-traded funds have surged in popularity with regular investors. They are funds that track the performance of a particular index or asset. An S&P 500 ETF, for example, simply tracks the S&P 500’s gains and losses. These funds are meant to lower commissions since investors don’t generally pay fees to fund managers. A spot bitcoin ETF would track the price of the cryptocurrency and allow investors to have it in their portfolios through an investment fund instead. After several delays, the SEC could make a decision on whether or not to authorize a spot bitcoin ETF in January. But it’s far from guaranteed the regulator will approve it. The SEC has rejected previous applications, arguing the cryptocurrency market is too easily susceptible to manipulation. But an investment firm called Grayscale Investments sued the SEC, and a court agreed that the regulator was wrong to reject its application. That has boosted optimism the SEC will approve it this time around, which could be a game changer, helping to solidify the digital currency’s legitimacy. “It would potentially open up the door to lots and lots of people who say, ‘Look, I don’t buy this entire crypto story, but bitcoin sounds interesting,’” says Kevin Werbach, a professor at Wharton. Cryptocurrencies may be making a recovery, but regulators are by no means embracing them. The SEC has filed suits against some of the biggest names in crypto, including Coinbase and Kraken. And notably, the SEC was not part of that major settlement with Binance. The market regulator has filed 13 charges against the crypto company and CZ, alleging they misled investors, and those suits will continue to move forward. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long been leery of crypto, comparing it to “the Wild West” and there is no indication he has changed his mind. In the year ahead, Wharton’s Werbach expects to see more crypto-related enforcement actions. “It takes time to build these cases — especially the major ones against these big players who are nominally not based in the United States,” he says. Tensions between regulators and crypto companies have continued to rise because of a lack of clear rules about digital currencies. Gensler has made it clear he believes that most of them are securities, and therefore fall under his agency’s purview.

Dan provides unique conservative commentary and analysis of stories that the mainstream media...Full Bio Multiple sources confirm to ""The Dan O\'Donnell Show"" that it\'s ""not an accident"" that Major League Baseball asked Milwaukee Brewers owner Mark Attanasio to head the committe tasked with relocating the Oakland A\'s to Las Vegas amid uncertainty surrounding American Family Field financing. The Associated Press reported in June that Attanasio would lead the committee, but MLB never formally announced its members. That report ran just two weeks after MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred visited Milwaukee and stressed the importance of the government entity that owns American Family Field to uphold the obligations of its lease and provide funding for stadium repairs. ""This is a gem of a ballpark,"" Manfred told reporters during batting practice before a Brewers game at American Family Field in late May. ""It\'s really important that the existing obligation under the lease be funded so that this great ballpark is maintained on a regular basis. It needs to be done in a timely way."" Manfred added that ""there is not a scenario that is in my mind at the current moment"" that the Brewers would leave Milwaukee, but his comments were widely seen as an ultimatum to the Southeastern Wisconsin Professional Baseball Park District, the public entity that owns American Family Field. Two weeks later, Manfred selected Attanasio as the head of the A\'s relocation committee. ""It wasn\'t an accident,"" one Major League Baseball source told ""The Dan O\'Donnell Show. ""[The commissioner] wanted to give [Attanasio] a front row seat to how the process would play out in case he would have to go through it,"" said another source. Every source that ""The Dan O\'Donnell Show"" spoke to reiterated that Major League Baseball believes that the chances of the Brewers having to leave Milwaukee are extremely remote, but that Manfred is concerned that state and local government leaders have been thus far unable to come to an agreement on stadium financing. ""It\'s not like there was an ultimatum or anything, but [MLB] is obviously preparing for any possibility, even if it\'s remote,"" said another source, who added that MLB often asks Attanasio to serve on various committees because he is well-respected among fellow owners and is willing to volunteer his time. ""Putting him in charge of the relocation committee was definitely intentional, even if it wasn\'t like, \'Oh you\'re going to be the next owner to have to go through it,\'"" the source explained. ""It was more about having him familiar with the process just in case."" Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers proposed $290 million in state budget surplus funds for stadium financing in February, but Republicans who control the Legislature rejected this plan, saying they were ""blindsided"" by it. Earlier this month, Republicans put forth their own plan to use $611 million in public money to fund repairs that would come primarily from tax revenue generated by American Family Field itself. Representative Rob Brooks, the author of the Republican plan, conceded Sunday that it would need Democrat support to move forward and does not currently have the votes to pass. ""It would be very close and very tough if we had to do it,"" he said on ""Upfront."" ""I think we\'re going to need some Dem votes, but what I have found in talking to Speaker Vos and my colleagues, every time we explain the details to people one-on-one, they get it."" Governor Evers indicated that he was open to supporting a bipartisan funding plan. ""We have to get together and finalize it,"" he told WISN 12 News on Monday. ""There\'s too many moving parts right now. I\'m not going to respond to different things. All I know, we have to be careful about sticking it to the [City of Milwaukee] or [Milwaukee County]."" The Republican plan calls for annual contributions from both the city and county totaling $200 million over the terms of the new 27-year lease, something Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson has opposed. ""I would prefer that number to be zero,"" he said, before conceding that ""that is unlikely so I would prefer now that that number is as low as it possibly can be.""'}]"

Stefanie Fischer, a mom of two from Oregon, can relate to those feelings. ""Definitely tried a lot of the sensors with baby one. You know, anxious. Is he OK? Is he breathing? Is he alive?"" Fischer recalled. She remembers feeling crippling anxiety when she would put her new baby in a car seat, wondering if there was anything she could use to help. And sure enough, there\'s a gadget for that. Fischer used something called a SNUZA Hero. It\'s described as a portable, wearable baby abdominal movement monitor. ""It just like clips on the waistband,"" she said. And the smart devices for babies don\'t stop there. Beds that rock through the night (Snoo). Diaper pails with built-in UV light to take away smells (munchkin). Humidifiers (Safety 1st), thermometers (Sense-U), bottle makers (babybrezza) and sound machines (Hatch) that all connect to your phone. Goetz is around a lot of babies at UnityPoint Health-Meriter. She says there\'s not a problem with using smart devices, but with them comes a whole new concern. False alarms. When talking about a pulse oximeter, she mentioned a product called the Owlet. ""They are not regulated in the same way as the medical pulse oximeters that we use in the hospital,"" said Dr. Goetz. ""One of the pitfalls of using those devices is that they can have a lot of false alarms, which can lead to a lot of parental anxiety."" The American Academy of Pediatrics hasn\'t come out with a strong stance on smart nurseries either way, but there have been discussions. ""One of the concerns that we as pediatricians have is that the use of these devices will make people more relaxed about the Safe Sleep guidelines,"" said Dr. Goetz. Goetz says in the end, paying an exorbitant amount of money isn\'t necessary because nothing substitutes the real thing. ""I keep coming back to the basic tenet that looking at your baby, knowing what kind of signs of illness to watch for by just looking and observing are often much more effective and powerful ways of knowing how your baby\'s doing,"" she said. The Fischers agree. With their second child, they have found confidence in what works for them. One ""smart"" product they say they can\'t live without is the Hatch sound machine. But everything else, they feel, is optional. ""I love that there\'s so many things available that everyone, you know, that works for everyone\'s different situations,"" said Fischer.

""Today we\'re making sure Milwaukee is coming back and all of Milwaukee is coming back,"" Biden said. Biden, shining a light specifically on Black-owned businesses Wednesday. ""Milwaukee business applications are up 70 percent compared before the pandemic. The share of Black people employed in 2022 was the highest in more than a decade,"" Biden added. The President said his $15 billion bipartisan infrastructure law offers opportunity and hope to communities, like Milwaukee, to fully participate in today\'s economy. Something local business, Rashaun Spivey, understands first-hand. ""After years of hard work I achieved my goal of becoming a master plumber and opened my own business, Hero Plumbing,"" Spivey said. Entrepreneurship sparked by Spivey\'s own mother, and continued, he said, by Biden\'s investment in Black-owned businesses and city-wide infrastructure. ""President Biden\'s support of Black-owned businesses have helped us live up to the hero name. Thanks to his investments, we\'ve been able to replace 600 lead lateral pipes across the city, mostly at child care centers,"" Spivey explained. Across Milwaukee, thousands of miles of lead lateral pipes need to be replaced, a decades-long process. However, Biden\'s infrastructure plan promises to accelerate that timeline. ""Last month we proposed a new rule that\'s gonna require the water systems to be fully replaced in Milwaukee within 10 years. 10 years instead of 60,"" Biden added. This was just one of two stops President Biden had in the Milwaukee area today. Likely, we could see him again as Wisconsin plays a crucial role in the 2024 election.
