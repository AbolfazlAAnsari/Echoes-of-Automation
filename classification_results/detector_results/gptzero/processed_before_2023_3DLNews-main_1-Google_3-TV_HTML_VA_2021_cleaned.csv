The Better Business Bureau says they might want to think twice about that. Look, it’s completely understandable. Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is a huge deal, and you — let’s say it’s you — probably want to share the news (”So I did a thing,” etc) with your family, friends and followers. But posing for a selfie with that vaccination card could leave you open to identity theft. The card has your full name on it, after all. It also has your birthday and information about where you got your vaccine. Match that with the information already available about you on your social media profiles and through your digital footprint (hint: it’s a lot) and someone could be well on their way to appropriating your identity online. That’s not all. Posting your vaccination card could also make it easier for scammers to create phony versions of those cards. According to BBB, scammers in Great Britain were caught selling fake vaccination cards on eBay and TikTok.
