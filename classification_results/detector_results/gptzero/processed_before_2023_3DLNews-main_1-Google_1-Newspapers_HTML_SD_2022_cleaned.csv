Have you been following the court case Biden v. Texas? It’s not in the headlines every day, but court filings in the case are giving us the best picture yet of what the Biden administration is doing on the U.S.-Mexico border. And the news is very, very bad. Much of what follows comes from the very informative reporting of Andrew Arthur, at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors tighter restrictions on immigration. Arthur has examined the voluminous filings in Biden v. Texas and has pieced together what is going on. Biden v. Texas is a lawsuit filed by the states of Texas and Missouri in an effort to stop the Biden administration from throwing out what was known as the Migrant Protection Protocols. That was a Trump administration program that required asylum seekers who cross into the United States to wait in Mexico while their claims are adjudicated, rather than being released into the United States to live for years while the immigration system slowly gets around to their case. As part of the suit, the Department of Homeland Security has been required to produce information on how it handles illegal border crossers. How many are turned back? For what reason? How many are allowed to stay in the United States? The numbers, as Arthur has collected them, are troubling. The big number is that the Biden administration has admitted 1,049,532 illegal border crossers into the United States in the time it has been in office. That is greater than the population of Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington, D.C., and of the president’s home state of Delaware. It’s a lot of people. And remember, it is the total number of illegal border crossers allowed to stay in the United States, not the total number caught at the border. The number is far, far bigger than in the past. “By way of comparison,” Arthur writes, “that (1,049,532) is more people released into the United States than the total number of migrants Border Patrol agents at the Southwest border apprehended in any given fiscal year between 2007 and 2020.” But it gets even worse than that. The figure of 1,049,532 does not include so-called got-aways – the illegal border crossers who managed to elude capture or turn themselves in to the Border Patrol. Nor does it include the number of unaccompanied minor children allowed to stay in the United States. The got-aways are estimated at around 700,000 since Biden took office. There is no indication the administration is trying to find and deport them. The number of unaccompanied minors was 190,053. “If all those 190,053 unaccompanied minors were placed into one school district, it would be the nation’s tenth largest,” writes Arthur. That’s bigger than school districts in Dallas, Charlotte, Philadelphia, San Diego and many others. So put together the three categories of illegal border crossers – the individual adult crossers and families allowed to stay, the unaccompanied children and the got-aways – and the total number of illegal border crossers allowed to remain in the United States approaches 2 million, just since Joe Biden entered the White House. Is it any wonder that illegal crossers keep flocking to the U.S.-Mexico border? Starting with the 2020 campaign, candidate Biden sent the message to them: If you come to the U.S., if you cross illegally into the country, you will be allowed to stay. Now, with Biden president, that has proven true for at least 1 million, and perhaps as many as 2 million, people. Republicans have tried to make illegal crossings a big political issue, and polls show it is a serious public concern, although nowhere near concerns about, say, inflation. It might be an even bigger issue were there widespread reporting of the Biden administration’s secret efforts to relocate illegal crossers into towns and cities across the country. “Under cover of darkness, every night the federal government is transporting illegal migrants as fast as it can away from the border on secret charter flights into unsuspecting communities around the country,” the New York Post’s Miranda Devine wrote in January. “Officials have lied and obstructed the few journalists who have tried to reveal the truth.” Will things change if Republicans win control of one or both houses of Congress this November? Probably not. Much of what the Biden administration is doing is being done on the basis of the executive authority of the president to enforce – or not enforce – the immigration laws. “Not to be a downer, but none of this is going to change anytime soon,” writes Arthur. “You should be prepared for longer commutes, larger class sizes, more extended waits in your local emergency room, higher state and local taxes, even more inflated housing costs. ... President Biden is not going to change his border policies, unless and until the courts or the electorate force him to.” Other items that may interest you New telecom project discussed in Brookings Shooting sports driving growth in South Dakota 4-H program South Dakota GFP commissioners tackle issues, including license entrance fees at parks Grow fast, fun, easy microgreens Brookings hosting Miss South Dakota Scholarship contest More news View this issue Browse other issues 312 5th St Brookings SD Phone: 605-692-6271 Links of interest Get Social""}]"

Winter Storm Diaz blanketed the Pine Ridge Reservation in more than 30 inches of snow – incredible enough on its own – but it was amplified by intense winds that brought the area to a standstill under drifts of snow several feet high. Halverson, who represents the Pass Creek District on the Pine Ridge Reservation, described their harrowing situation to the Journal on Thursday. “It’s been really tough,” she said. “We don’t have the proper equipment here to handle what’s been going on. We have drifts as high as some houses that stretch 60, 70 yards at a time.” More than 10 days since the storm began, Diaz has moved on and the skies have started to clear, but the recovery process is just beginning. Halverson didn’t get dug out of her house until eight days after the storm. Others are still trapped, reachable only by snowmobile. It seems like every time we open the road, the snow just drifts it back over,” she said. More:Gov. Kristi Noem declares 'winter storm emergency' for South Dakota; activates National Guard It’s an incredibly scary situation, she explained, as many of those snowed-in are missing dialysis treatments or dealing with other medical emergencies. One family ran out of infant formula, and spent four days drifted in before attempting to leave, Halverson said. “We even talked about using drone drops to get the baby some Enfamil, because the baby was starving,” she said. But Mother Nature wasn’t done yet. If being trapped by formidable walls of ice and snow wasn’t enough, subzero temperatures, brought down by an Arctic front, took an already struggling region by the neck. Temperatures dropped into the negative teens and 20s this week, and the unkind Midwest wind shredded those figures with wind chills in the negative 40s and negative 50s. Cold like that is deadly, just another blow to a reservation already crippled by conditions, Halverson said. “Most of our members use wood stoves,” she said. “We’re not able to get them with deliveries because of the roads. A lot of our members across the reservation have no propane, because the propane companies can’t reach their tanks to fill. Even right now in my district, we haven’t had anybody able to deliver out to these members that have no propane since the storm started.” Oglala-based service organization Re-Member provides firewood to families on all corners of the reservation, but the drifts of snow have rendered their wood stockpile inaccessible still – and it’ll be that way for the foreseeable future. “Our wood pile remains inaccessible,” read a Facebook post on Dec. 20. “Our skid steer and plow are out-of-service. Given the conditions, it would be near impossible to operate our equipment and unsafe for our staff to work in the conditions we are facing. We appreciate the efforts being made by many to keep the Oyate safe during these challenging times.” Those that can try to use electric heaters, which Halverson said isn’t keeping houses warm. Even her own furnace went out, blowing cold air in an already frigid atmosphere. She was able to travel to her mother’s house to keep her family warm. Power went out in some places, once for 18 hours, she said. People with cars tried to use them to stay warm. Reservation residents are resorting to last-ditch efforts to ward off the unimaginable cold. More:Sioux Falls Regional Airport will close through much of Friday due to blizzard “I’ve seen across the reservation some members were burning clothes in their wood stove because they couldn’t get access to wood,” Halverson said. The conditions got so bad so quickly that Oglala Sioux Tribe President Frank Star Comes Out penned a proclamation declaring a state of emergency. “These current blizzard conditions have caused closure of all BIA and tribal secondary roads on the reservation due to falling snow, high winds and snow drifts,” Star Comes Out wrote. “Such blizzard conditions pose an imminent threat to tribal government operations, to public safety and the health of tribal members who currently do not have access to medical care, such as dialysis, ambulance service for crisis intervention medical care such as heart attacks and delivering babies, and private transportation to secure food and other necessities of life.” Halverson praised his efforts in trying to get help for the people of Pine Ridge. The exhaustion in her voice dissipated – for a brief second – calling her people “survivors.” “We don’t live on our reservation,” she said. “We survive on our reservation. We’re in serious need of some help.”""}]"

The book was released on the 50th anniversary of the race riot which is the subject of the book. Truhe grew up in Winner. He graduated from Winner High School in 1963. While attending high school Truhe worked at the Winner Advocate. He has a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in 1967. He also has an honorary doctorate from School of Mines in 2003. He received his law degree from Northwestern Law School in 1970. Truhe was on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 1970-74. He served aboard the USS Kitty Hawk off the coast of North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. He served as a lieutenant in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps. After his military duty, Truhe returned to South Dakota and was an assistant attorney general in the AG office in 1974 as head of trial division. He was in private practice from 1975-2007 in Rapid City working corporate, mining and environmental law. Truhe retired in 2008 and moved to Colorado with his wife, Nicki. Truhe says the book is a story of racial injustice and is a first person account of Truhe’s experience as a US Navy JAG lawyer during the Vietnam War. An interracial confrontation occurred aboard the ship while it was conducting bombing runs into north Vietnam. Truhe represented several of the 25 black sailors who were unjustly charged with rioting and assaults. The book covers riots and the court martial trails that followed. Truhe said his goal in writing the book was to set the record straight because of all the one sided and erroneous chronicles of the incident. “I wanted to write the complete story in a fair and balanced manner,” he said. He started writing the book after the special court martials were completed and while Truhe was serving as a military judge. He collected thousands of pages of original source documents: Navy investigation reports, hundreds of sworn statements and medical records, Congressional subcommittee hearing testimony, his own case files and interviews with client witnesses. Truhe retained these documents for 50 years (six banker boxes) and again took up writing the book in January 2021. In January 2022 he presented his manuscript to the publisher for editing. Editing was completed in July and the book came out in October. Truhe said his inspiration and goal in writing the book was to set the record straight because of all the one-sided and erroneous chronicles of the incident. Among the injustices he said were 25 black sailors were charged with rioting and assaults against white sailors, but no white sailors were charged. He said this was a totally one sided investigation. Truhe added Navy officials withheld critical evidence from defense lawyers. Photos and details are in the book’s website, marvtruhe.com Truhe was invited to give a book presentation at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. The newspaper in San Diego, Calif., wrote a front page story on the book Nov. 20. In the newspaper story, Truhe said there was deep-seeded racism in Navy, an institution he respected then and respects still. Questions about fairness in the legal system, an arena where he would do his life’s work. Questions about integrity and honesty. That’s why he kept those five boxes, to look for answers. It’s why he turned what was inside into a book which offers the most complete picture yet of what happened on board the aircraft carrier and in the trials that followed. Writing the book took Truhe 18 months of 12 hour days, time spent sifting through documents, remembering details, reliving the story. “I am not usually an angry person but I was angry as all this unfolded 50 years ago,” he said. In end, 23 Black Kitty Hawk sailors faced court-martials in San Diego, most of them accused of rioting and assault. Only one white sailor was charged with assault, three months after the riot. He was acquitted. Of the black defendants, seven accepted plea deals admitting to one or more reduced charges and received minimal sentences such as time-served or fine. Ten were convicted at a trial of one or more offenses and also received minimal sentences. Six others were exonerated. Three had their charges dismissed before trial, two were acquitted. Worried that the book might come across as a “one-sided rant by a disgruntled defense attorney” Truhe said he took pains to be balanced in the depiction of events. The 320 page book includes 1,100 footnotes. The book can be purchased through Amazon, Barnes&Noble and other locations. Truhe and his wife live in a retirement community in Broomfield, Colo. His wife is from Colorado and they were married in 1970 just before he went on active duty. The couple have been married for 52 years. They have a son, Eric, his wife, Leigh, both attorneys, live nearby with two children. Government offices in Winner will be closed on Monday, Jan. 2 in observance of the new year’s holiday.
