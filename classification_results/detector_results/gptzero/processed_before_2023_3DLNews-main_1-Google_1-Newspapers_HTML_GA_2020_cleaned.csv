Once responding agencies arrived, they located a male victim, in his early to mid-30’s, laying to the side of the railroad tracks face down with multiple injuries. The Georgia Bureau of Investigations Crime Scene Unit and the Habersham County Coroner’s Office were called to assist with the investigation. Norfolk Southern Police were contacted to assist in halting train traffic so that items of possible evidentiary value could be collected, and the scene preserved through photographic documentation. The body of Clayborn was transported to the GBI’s Medical Examiner’s office to determine the cause of death. Mt.

— Veteran newspaper executive Mike Gebhart has purchased the majority ownership in Southern Community Newspapers Inc., parent company of the Jackson Progress-Argus and six sister newspapers, along with digital operations consisting of a number of related websites. Gebhart purchased the newspapers and web operations from a New York-based private equity firm that has owned the majority stake in the company since 2008. Gebhart has been chief operating officer and executive vice president of SCNI since 2007. Other newspapers in the group include the Gwinnett Daily Post, Albany Herald, Clayton News-Daily, Henry Herald, Rockdale Citizen and Newton Citizen. “We’ve been working on this transaction for nearly a year,” Gebhart said. “I seriously contemplated backing out of the deal because of the pandemic and concerns that revenues have plummeted. However, after much prayer, contemplation, support from a great wife and family, and wise counsel, I decided it was the right thing to do. We have so many loyal employees I want them to have the opportunity to continue their careers, and our communities need us to tell them the truth about what’s going on locally. I’m motivated to give back to others for as long as possible.” Gebhart, a resident of Gwinnett County, is a native of St. Louis, Mo. He graduated from Missouri Baptist University in 1978 and did graduate work for an MBA at St. Louis University and Webster University prior to beginning a professional career in the newspaper industry with the Suburban Journals in St. Louis. His career took him to senior-level positions at media outlets in New Jersey, Connecticut, Philadelphia, Michigan and Georgia. He currently serves as treasurer of the Georgia Press Association. Gebhart moved to Georgia in 2004 when he joined the Albany Herald as vice president and general manager. He was promoted to president and publisher Oct. 1, 2005. In November 2007, he was named the COO and executive vice president of SCNI, with responsibility for the entire media division consisting of seven newspapers and several websites. Gebhart and his wife Nancy, also a native of St. Louis, live in Duluth. They have three children and nine grandchildren.

hangs over fireplace in the formal living room. The 117-year-old home sitting on the north end of Commerce Street is not only packed with splendor, but it also contains an underground tunnel. The 4,100-plus square-foot home is located at 10235 Commerce Street. Some people call it the Selman house. Some recall it being the home of the late Summerville Attorney and his wife, Ed and Vanita Surles. But for Beth and Todd Kingsolver and their four children, they call it home. “I love this house so much,” Beth said. The Kingsolvers lived in Subligna and worried if the city life would be too noisy. To their surprise, the house is constructed in such a way, with thick walls, that noise of motorists on Highway 27 is rather quiet from inside the home. “I slept like a baby the first night we moved in. I was just so happy to be here. . . This house is so solid; you don’t hear anything on the outside,” Beth said. The house includes seven bedrooms and four bathrooms. The Kingsolvers have condensed two of those rooms into a play area for their children. They purchased the home in July 2017 and learned that Mrs. Surles had her own name for the home. “When we got the original keys, they all said ‘Oak Haven’ on them,” Beth said. The home has several large oak trees around the property. But the biggest oak is the focal point of a patio area behind the house. “Someone told us that oak tree was over 500 years old,” she said. “It’s one of those things we are going to hold onto as long as we can.” The tree has a few branches that need removing but hopes to keep the tree around. The back yard was pivotal in the Kingsolvers’ decision to buy the home. They were living in Subligna and enjoyed the country atmosphere. However, they wanted to move closer toward town. They spent six years passively house shopping. Driving through Summerville each day while taking her children to Trion City Schools, Beth was drawn to the large square-shaped home. “We wanted a big, old square shape house,” Beth said. They thought one day that would mean some farmhouse closer to the city. They wanted enough land for their children to play outside. “I just pulled in here one day and I saw the back yard,” she said. The house has a small front yard. The back portion, however, looks fairly large. The property is .85 acres, but the fenced yard in the back appears almost that size. The back of the property adjoins Town Creek at the back and Willow Spring Park on the south side. Beth said her sons can still enjoy playing in the creek and catching turtles and frogs as if they were in the country. “We probably save $500 in gas by moving into the city,” Beth joked about the long commutes from Subligna to Trion. The house is a prominent parcel in Summerville’s geography and history. Her son Whitten’s upstairs bedroom overlooks the downtown area and the Chattooga County Courthouse is easily spotted. But the first six years after the house was constructed, the courthouse was absent from the Summerville skyline. The house has remained while the downtown landscaped changed, expanded or contracted like when the state highway expanded lanes and took up a little more of Surles’ front yard in the 1980s. Walking into the front door, people are greeted with a white marble tile foyer with an archway that leads to stairs with three landings. The formal living room to the right is what her son Whitten calls, “the beautiful room.” It has white carpet, antique furniture and a cozy fireplace that contains a large family picture of the Kingsolvers. “We don’t use it except for Thanksgiving and Christmas or if we have special guests,” Beth said. The formal dining room is another area that isn’t used a lot. It also has white carpet and antiques. Beth has also included some artworks from local artists, like a painting of the courthouse by local artist Billy Smith. A small hallway from the kitchen to the formal dining room includes a butler room and a large tall set of glass window cabinets. “This is probably one of my favorite things about the house is the built-in cabinets,” Beth said. The house seems a lot larger than 4,100 square feet. The upstairs is like a child wonderland. It’s where all the children live and play. They all have their special rooms. For example, the oldest, Hayden, immediately picked the room with Trion-blue carpet as his room. The house also has a basement with some historical, noteworthy points. The house used to have a coal operated furnace. On the outside of the house, there used to be a small window that allowed for deliveries of coal. A truck carrying coal would back near the window and someone would shovel the coal into the basement for the furnace. The basement also contains some of the mysterious elements that make it eccentric. The large wooden beams that comprise of the guts, sturdy-worthiness of the solid house, has evidence that it burned in years past. In addition to the wooden beams, the house is supported by steel beams underneath. Another eccentric point is the house contains a tunnel. It’s believed that the tunnel goes from the house to Willow Spring Park. Beth heard that servants used to fetch water from the spring and would use the tunnel to travel back and forth. The tunnel has been closed part of the way. But a portion of the tunnel still remains. The house has lots of storage room. A lot of families worry where they are going to store their belongings. The Kingsolvers worry what they are going to do with their ample storage space. “We have so much storage we don’t know what to do with it,” Beth said. Beth’s ambition is to keep this home in the family name for years to come. She loves the property and wants it to be a home for future Thanksgivings and Christmas holidays for years to come.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 4:56 pm Andy Bauman The city of Sandy Springs’ concerns over billboards continue. “Prior to 2005 with the lack of (Fulton County) regulation regarding billboards, on Oct. 4, 2012, a consent agreement after a long-running lawsuit was reached,” City Attorney Dan Lee said of a legal battle the city had with billboard companies that dated back to soon after it incorporated in 2005. “The current ordinance does not allow any other new billboards.” The city is considering raising the height of a digital/LED billboard on Carpenter Drive at 5793 Roswell Road that fronts Interstate 285 from 50 feet to 85 feet to pull the light it emits 24/7 away from the Laurel Grove condominiums and Comfort Inn hotel nearby. The light became a problem after recent development and tree removal exposed it to the condos and hotel. Under the consent agreement, the city would allow the billboard to increase its height, but in return, Lamar Advertising, which owns the billboard, would give the city two other static, two-sided billboards located at 6390 and 8613 Roswell Road. But when the decision came before a vote at the Sandy Springs City Council’s Feb. 4 meeting at City Springs, concerns over how the Georgia Department of Transportation’s plans to build express lanes along 285 and the impact the raised billboard might have on another residential community caused the council to vote 6-0 to defer the decision until its March 17 meeting. “I think the pluses of this are well known,” said District 6 Councilman Andy Bauman, who brought up the issue at the Jan. 21 council meeting and motioned for the deferral Feb. 4. “I think we’ve quantified them as the improvement of the view and the removal of the light and the intrusion into the condos and hotel. We’re also removing two static billboards. That’s the whole process of the council meeting. I want to use these (next) six weeks to raise some questions and determine what the evidence is.” Before the council’s vote, two residents spoke to raise concerns about the decision. “The sound barrier wall under construction this very week on the Roswell Road exit ramp (at 285) will most likely block portions of the view of the billboard for northbound Roswell Road drivers,” said Ronda Smith, president of the Sandy Springs Council of Neighborhoods. “What the (billboard) company markets to advertisers as impressions will be lost. “While only available as a GDOT visualization, could one assume at the present height, an additional portion of those merely 1 million weekly impressions for this LED billboard be lost once the flyover express lanes are completed? One can safely assume that GDOT would not show the billboard company any more mercy in its plans than those property owners slated to lose their homes or to be significantly negatively impacted under all the current roadway expansion plans.” Bob Lepping, president of the Glenridge Hammond Neighborhood Association, the community that could be adversely affected by the raised billboard, said, “My questions would be can anyone predict with any accuracy if the light emanated or the line of sight would affect the south side of Glenridge Hammond? Number two, will it be seen? If any additional trees are taken by GDOT in its express lanes project, will it be even more visible? Are there any unintended consequences of the height?” The deferral comes two and a half weeks after the city filed an emergency motion in Fulton County Superior Court to request the immediate removal of billboards owned by Outfront Media LLC located at 6215 Roswell Road, property the city already owns. Sandy Springs plans to construct a temporary fire station at 6189 Roswell Road as it rebuilds 50-year-old Fire Station No. 2, located on Johnson Ferry Road.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 4:57 pm Nevaeh Hart Nevaeh Hart A victim of bullying at a young age herself, 10-year-old Nevaeh Hart has written and published a new picture book that teaches other kids how to deal with bullies. The Evoline C. West Elementary fifth-grader was inspired to write “Overcoming a Bully” after reading a memoir on overcoming abusive relationships, written by her mother Raina Knox. In the story, a girl named Emma is the new kid at school who hopes to have fun and make friends, but instead finds herself being targeted by a bully named Laura. Laura makes fun of Emma and bullies her about her appearance. She initially gets upset and is unable to concentrate, but eventually Emma’s character succeeds in winning her bully over. “I am excited to publish my first book,” Nevaeh said in a news release from Fulton County Schools. “Through this book, I would like to say to never let anyone take power over you. I took my power back, and my superpower is making reading great again. What I have gone through, I don’t want anyone else to experience it. So, ‘Overcoming a Bully’ will be a great help for kids.” The book also instructs children on how to seek help when being bullied and sheds light on the effects of bullying. “As her mother, I am so proud of her for taking control and writing a book,” Knox said in a statement. “It has been breath-taking; to see where she was three years ago to now is unbelievable. Kids her age will want to read the book because they may see something they have dealt with and see how she overcame wasn’t easy, no, but it will be worth it.” Ilham Boam illustrated the book, which is available both in e-book and paperback format on Amazon.

The Herald sent questions to candidates Jim Gowen and Raymond Roberts. Below are the answers that were provided in alphabetical order. Jim Gowen Biographical info My name is Jim Gowen. My wife of 14 years, Mandy Gowen, is originally from Cullman, AL. We have two daughters, Julianna (10) and Charlie (7). I graduated from Charlton County High School in 1997. Following High School, I attended the University of Georgia and graduated from the Business School as a Marketing major, with an emphasis on Forest Business. I am a member of Folkston United Methodist Church, volunteering my time working with different groups and projects. Coaching our youth in recreational sports is a passion of mine. I’ve coached over 20 recreation teams in football, t-ball, baseball, softball and recently added soccer to the mix. As a Forester for Gowen Timber Company, I buy timber from local landowners, work with loggers to cut timber and sell to area mills. In addition, I also teach a Forestry class to High School students through Coastal Pines Technical College. Why did you decide to run for this office? I decided to run for City Council for my family. As a father of young children, I want to make sure my voice is heard on issues that concern the future of the city. My goal is to do all I can to ensure the city prospers and is a good option for them in the future, when they are looking for a place to start a career and raise a family. Why do you think you are the best candidate for the job? As a local small business owner, I have worked with budgets, security and employee retention. I feel there are many commonalities between keeping the lights on at a small business, and working with others to efficiently operate the city of Folkston. What is the most important issue facing the city of Folkston today? The future of D. Ray James Correctional Facility is a very important issue for our city. The GEO Group has employed our citizens and has provided much needed jobs for our community growing our local economy. The additional tax revenue generated from the prison helps our city and county meet their budgets every year. In addition, the prison has also supported the community with food drives and scholarships. We need to do whatever is in our power to keep the prison operational. If elected, what changes do you think need to be made? While there’s always work to be done, I am anxious to work with our Mayor, present City Council, and County Commissioners, as a unit, to brainstorm ways to help our hometown thrive. A few areas I would like to focus my efforts on, specifically, but not limited to supporting law enforcement and first responders; growing rail-watch and Okefenokee tourism; increase small business opportunities; supporting parks and recreation development; and reinforcing littering laws. Raymond Roberts Biographical info My name is Raymond Roberts. I was born and raised in Camden County, GA. I am a 1969 graduate of Ralph Johnson Bunch School of Woodbine, GA. I have been a resident of Folkston, Ga for over 44 years where I reside with my wife Della Houston Roberts of Folkston. We have five sons: Raymond Jr., Theodore, Julian, Rodriecous and Travis, all of whom are pursuing productive careers with their own families. I was employed by Gilman Paper company of Camden County for 39 years, until the company closed. I was then employed by Masonite Door Fab for 9 years until I retired. I’m a member of St. Matthew’s Baptist Church where I serve as the Assistant Pastor to Rev. Ronnie Pollock. I served as the president of the local NAACP for 15 years. I am very involved in the community through church, civic and community events; including school, sports and the many subjects of concern for our county and city. Why did you decide to run for this office? I decided to run for City Council At-Large to do more to help Charlton County by working diligently on continuing unity with the City and County officials. Although I have always worked in my community and given back, being elected into this position will allow me to contribute in a different way. It will allow me the opportunity to be in a position to advocate and be a voice for the people of our community. Why do you think you are the best candidate for this job? My previous experience serving on the Local Union 446 board as Chief Shop Stewart with Gilman Paper Company, leading the local NAACP and working within other social and civic organizations have equipped me with the leadership, motivation and tenacity to help move our city forward. I am confident in my ability to listen respectfully, weigh differing opinions, and take into consideration what’s best for the community as a whole. What is the most important issue facing the City? The citizens of the city are concerned about the future of the employment rate. More specifically, the future of one of the largest employers, GEO Prison, is in question. The concern lies around the longevity of its existence and the possibility of job losses which would have a huge economic impact on many households. Should this happen, we must also realize the domino effect that would also impact our local businesses. Another major concern facing the city is an increase in taxes. If elected, what changes do you think need to be made? There needs to be ongoing research and increased growth for small businesses. The City Chief and County Sheriff must continue to work collaboratively to keep open communication to bridge any current gaps in our system. We must continue to listen to the citizens who are seeking to enhance The Beauty of Our City. Organizing and executing a “Citizen Clean Up Day In Your Community” would be a great way to bring everyone together. Ensure that our youth will take enough pride in our city to work alongside local residents to promote and maintain the upkeep of our city. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular images.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 4:01 pm JACKSONVILLE — Stanford Carter Stipe was born December 21, 1965, in Jesup, Georgia.

Stipe moved to Jacksonville in 1988 and married his high school sweetheart, Jennifer Ziolkowski, where they created their lives together. Stipe passed away at the age of 54 on Bennett Sunday, September 27, 2020, at his home, surrounded by his family. He was a proud Georgia Southern Eagle where he received his Bachelor’s Degree in Building Construction Technology. He earned the starting position as the long snapper where he was known as the smallest Division I lineman in the country. During this time, Stipe was especially proud to have contributed to two back-to-back football national championships in 1985 and 1986. Stipes’ passion for General Construction turned into his career and he opened Stipe Construction, Inc., at the age of 39. He was very proud of the commercial buildings that he was responsible for. Stipe was a devoted coach to many young athletes, coaching both baseball and basketball. He was a positive influence and role model to many children in the community. Stipe had a kind-hearted nature and was always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. He was an advocate in supporting the Alzheimer’s Association where friends and family joined “Stan the Man” team to support the fight to end Alzheimer’s. Earlier this year Stipe was honored and inducted into the Waycross-Ware County Sports Hall of Fame for his athletic achievements throughout his life. He was preceded in death by his father, Daniel Stipe, grandparents, The Rev. and Mrs. Elzie (Doris) Carter, Mr. and Mrs. Everett (Maude) Stipe, mother-in-law, Warnell Ziolkowski, sister-in-law, Dolores Stipe, and step-father, Larry Hengeveld. Stipe is survived by his wife, Jennie, and four children, Jacob Stanford, Jada Elizabeth, Jared Carter, and Jessica Danielle; his mother, Jeanette Stipe; brothers, Steve Stipe, Scott (Shae) Stipe, Shannon (Kris) Stipe, and Stuart (Summer); God-children, Hayden Sani and Farris Sani; and numerous aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and cousins.

Meanwhile, vulnerable populations must eat, obtain other essential services, and seek medical care for non-Covid issues. Many of these interactions would be with the non-vulnerable population, who would spread the disease to the vulnerable population. Hospitals would be overwhelmed, as has already happened in various cities at various times, and interventions would be reinstituted.And underlying the column is the subtext that our response is all some sort of political game to undermine Trump. A global response with quarantines and lockdowns in most countries, just to get Trump out of office? Of course it's an absurd notion. It is too bad that Trump chose to politicize our response. This could have been a unifying event, like our response to 9/11.So Rob, this one is an improvement, but you can do better. It's good to see Rob apparently recognize that this is a real disease that has killed many people who would not have died otherwise. This is a far cry from his previous columns indicating that public health interventions are due to mass hysteria rather than a real problem. So bravo Rob for coming around.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 4:04 pm LOGANVILLE — A Loganville High School senior was killed and another student injured last week in a high-speed, single-car accident on Bay Creek Road. The traffic fatality is the third on a Walton County road this year. According to Loganville Police Department officials, a Lawrenceville police officer who lives in the area was on his way to work in a marked cruiser when he noticed a 2001 Chevrolet Camaro speeding on Bay Creek Road near the intersection at Lee Byrd Road. According to reports, the speed was estimated at being between 90 and 100 mph. The officer got behind the vehicle and using the public address system in his police cruiser told the driver, Christopher Ashe, 19, of Loganville, to slow down. The vehicle then sped off. The officer notified Loganville Police Department officers of the vehicle and proceeded to follow the suspected path but did not pursue the Camaro. After following the suspected path of the Camaro, the officer arrived at the scene of the accident, which took place near 87 Bay Creek Road between Highway 20 and Covington Street. According to reports, Ashe was speeding and left the right side of the road. The driver then over corrected and lost control, eventually hitting a tree on the other side of the road on the driver's side of the car. Ashe was not wearing his seat belt, according to officers, and was killed on impact. The passenger, Christopher Calhoun, 18, of Loganville, was wearing his seat belt and was treated at Gwinnett Medical Center and later released. This is the first traffic fatality for the City of Loganville since 2004. In 2005, Walton County ranked among the state's top five per capita in the number of traffic fatalities.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 4:57 pm Candler County Coroner Allen Tyler has announced his candidacy for re-election to a second term in office. A lifelong resident of Candler County, Tyler first began public service about 17 years ago when he started as a volunteer with Metter Fire-Rescue. His duties included firefighting, extrication and hazmat operations. He returned to school 13 years ago for his Emergency Medical Technician license and became an American Heart CPR instructor. In 2017, he jumped into the political arena to become the coroner of the county. “Once elected, I saw just how far in the past this office was being operated,” Tyler said. “My first order of business was to find a place to call an office. The office was placed in the EMS building where files could be placed under double lock. “The next order of business was to order file cabinets to store old files in to replace the cardboard boxes being used. Then a computer system was added so that all cases could be placed on computer and also have a paper report for back-up. “I work closely with the GBI Crime Lab in Pooler and with local law and emergency agencies, Georgia State Patrol, GBI investigation teams and local funeral homes. During my term, I have worked over 140 cases to date. “I am the only licensed Emergency Medical Technician, which gives me answers as to what was going on prior to a person’s death. “I am very dedicated to the people of this community and I like giving back to my community. I treat each family with respect and dignity during the loss of their loved one. I treat every family the same as if they are part of my own family.” Tyer was born in 1967 to Patril Mckenzie Tyler and the late Jessie Tyler and was raised in the business of helping families with the loss of loved ones. His grandfather, Oren Tyler, started building and installing burial vaults in 1935, and 52 years ago, his father, Jessie Tyler, started the monument memorial business, installing top-quality memorials for families. Tyler, along with his two sisters, continue to operate both of these businesses today. Tyler also owns and oeprates Green Acre Farms. He is a member of Candler County Young Farmers, where he has served as president for five years and past president for five years. He served on the Georgia State Young Farmer Board for six years and the National Young Farmer Board for four years. He was the National President in 2013 and was the first president from Georgia. He is a member of Cedar Street Baptist Church where he serves as a sound technician. “I am always there to help my community and the families I serve,” Tyler said. “I look forward to visiting with all members of the community, but if I miss you, I ask for your support in advance, or feel free to call me. I will be glad to answer any questions or concerns you may have, 912-690-2233. Thank you for allowing me to serve as your coroner.” Log In Keep it Clean.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 4:40 pm Gov. Brian Kemp and First Lady Marty Kemp join officials in cutting the ribbon on the new Receiving Hope Center in Paulding County. The first residential intake center for trafficked youth in the state of Georgia has opened in Paulding County. Governor Brian Kemp, First Lady Marty Kemp, GRACE Commission members, Wellspring Living leadership, and other partners were on hand to cut the ribbon of the new facility on Feb. 18. Called the Receiving Hope Center, the facility will take in survivors of domestic minor sex trafficking, providing them with a safe environment. Once there, they will have all their needs met and assessments completed at one location. While at this residential facility, survivors will receive medical care, academic support, therapeutic and stabilization services for up to 90 days before moving to a long-term placement, according to officials. According to the Wellspring Living website, the Receiving Hope Center serves youth ages 12 to 17 up to 90 days. Pregnancy, medical fragility and an IQ below 70 are exclusionary criteria. The center will also assist law enforcement and prosecutors by providing evidence needed to see justice served, stated officials. “We were grateful to be a part of the ribbon cutting for Wellspring Living’s new Receiving Hope Center, Georgia’s first residential intake center for trafficked youth. Together we will bring an end to modern day slavery in our state,” said Gov. Kemp in a tweet. To protect the safety of the residents, the facility's address in Paulding County is not listed. Kemp and his wife have made human trafficking a top priority. Last year, during his first year in office, Kemp issued an executive order creating a commission of public and law enforcement officials, for-profit and non-profit organizations, health-care executives and subject matter experts to spearhead the initiative. The GRACE Commission is co-chaired by Marty Kemp; Georgia House Speaker Pro Tempore Jan Jones, R-Milton; and Vic Reynolds, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Kemp also launched a website earlier this year aimed at training state workers and the general public in how to detect and respond to warning signs of human trafficking. There are an estimated 1.5 million victims of human trafficking in the United States. The FBI recently named Atlanta as one of 14 cities with abnormally high rates of human trafficking.
