But it’s unclear whether the roughly $118 billion legislation can pass Congress with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., immediately declaring it “dead on arrival” in the House and vowing to move forward with a separate Israel aid bill that would leave Ukraine without additional U.S. assistance. “As Ukraine runs low on ammunition to fend off [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s brutal invasion, it is imperative we finally extend our support,” Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Patty Murray said in a statement. “Ukraine’s fate and so much more hangs in the balance — it’s time for Congress to act.” Senate Republicans in December stalled votes on an earlier aid package, leading to two months of negotiations on unrelated immigration policy changes. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said he will tee up a procedural vote on the new aid package as soon as Wednesday, but it’s unclear whether it will even have the 60 votes needed to pass the upper chamber. The bill includes $60 billion in security and economic aid for Ukraine, $48.4 billion of which is for military support. That includes $13.7 billion for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative and $19.9 billion for the Pentagon to backfill weapons sent to Ukraine through U.S. stockpiles. There’s also $1.6 billion in Foreign Military Financing, allowing Ukraine and European countries impacted by Russia’s invasion to use the money to buy weapons from U.S. defense contractors. The Biden administration in December used its last tranche of Ukraine aid funds from previous assistance packages. A growing number of Republicans have become increasingly opposed to Ukraine aid, and many, including Johnson, claim the new bill’s immigration agreement “won’t come close to ending the border catastrophe.” The new aid bill is likely to lose Democratic support as well, with Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., accusing it of “dismantling our asylum system” and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., opposed to additional Israel aid. “If we continue to fund [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu’s indiscriminate war, how can we, with a straight face, criticize Putin’s targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine as a war crime?” Sanders wrote in a statement. The bill includes $10.6 billion for the Defense Department to continue providing munitions and other weapons to Israel after a four-month bombardment of Gaza that has displaced roughly 85% of the population and killed thousands of civilians. That amount includes $4 billion for the Iron Dome and David’s Sling air defense systems and $1.2 billion to procure the Iron Beam laser system to counter short-range rocket threats. There’s also another $3.5 billion in Foreign Military Financing for Israel and another $2 billion in the same account for Indo-Pacific security partners, including Taiwan. Unlike the December bill, the new legislation adds another $1.9 billion specifically to backfill weapons sent to Taiwan from U.S. stockpiles, providing the Pentagon’s long-requested appropriation that will allow it to use presidential drawdown authority to quickly transfer weapons to Taipei. The new bill adds another $2.4 billion for U.S. Central Command to continue countering a deluge of attacks from Iran-backed proxies amid the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The use of expensive missile systems like Tomahawks to counter Houthi attacks on commercial ships with less expensive drones and missiles has placed additional demands on U.S. munitions stockpiles. Additionally, the bill adds $542 million for Indo-Pacific Command’s FY24 unfunded priorities list. It also retains $2.1 billion in funding for the submarine-industrial base aimed at helping the Navy meet its submarine production goals while preparing to transfer as many as five Virginia-class submarines to Australia in the 2030s as part of the AUKUS agreement.

While Turner did not explicitly publicize the system in question, he is not an idiot. He knew that once the full House was briefed, the source and nature of this system would quickly leak. So why did he do it? One reason is that this leak supports Turner’s push to reauthorize a key government surveillance program. But it may also provide new financial benefits to some of Turner’s top corporate donors. As I reported Wednesday, the intelligence community believes that the Russian weapons system is designed to use a nuclear weapon to destroy U.S. civilian and military satellite constellations in war. If deployed, it would constitute a clear breach of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. It is unclear whether Russia already has deployed facilitating or preparatory elements of the system or is simply preparing to do so. Highly classified U.S. intelligence is responsible for the government’s knowledge of this program. Turner says we needed to know about the Russian program to respond to its threat. He may have feared that the Biden Administration would keep the relevant information classified, thus providing time and space for Russia to advance its program. This would be a reasonable concern in the context of the Administration’s cautious approach to dealing with Russian escalation concerns. Still, other factors also appear to be in play. For one, the Washington Post reports that intelligence on the Russian system was gathered via Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — I understand from sources that other collection methods were also involved — which allows for warrantless surveillance of foreigners outside the U.S. While government agencies have reformed their use of FISA 702 in response to controversy over their prior use of it to surveil Americans, many in Congress oppose reauthorizing it. Turner, however, strongly supports the program’s reauthorization, which faces a House vote in the near future. Turner likely sees his disclosure of the Russian anti-satellite system as a means of bolstering support for FISA 702 in Congress. Yet Turner had another possible reason to disclose the Russian program: securing new funding for defense industry interests in Ohio’s 10th Congressional District. Turner is renowned in Congress and by Washington lobbyists — the CGCN Group is one of his top donors in the 2024 election cycle — for his securing of patronage for business interests in his district. And these interests would appear to be well-placed to benefit from Turner’s disclosure of the new Russian system. The defense firms Leidos, Lockheed Martin, L3 Harris, and Northrop Grumman are all top donors to Turner in the 2024 election cycle. They have good reasons to be so. After all, Turner’s district is home to two Space Force operational units and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center. NASIC is based out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and leads the Defense Department’s foreign air and space threat analysis. Thus, NASIC would be central to any assessments related to the Russian system in question here. But NASIC is also a source for major contracts to private defense companies such as Leidos, for example. Similarly, L3 Harris has an $80 million contract from the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson AFB. These interests and others would be front-runners to win government contracts issued in response to the Russian system.

Comments like “‘yes, and?’ is just Zara dressing room music” and “I miss the old Ari” are on the kinder side of the feedback Grande has received. However, after listening to this track, I would argue these criticisms are wholly unfounded. In fact, in a somewhat prophetic move, Grande’s new song both preempts and responds to this adverse reaction. She explicitly calls out her haters throughout the song while also commanding the listener to rise above their personal critics. With an addictive beat and uplifting lyrics that exude confidence, “yes, and?” is an immensely exciting introduction to her much anticipated seventh studio album, Eternal Sunshine (2024). Before launching into this review, I must come clean: I have only listened to a handful of Ms. Grande’s songs and so cannot provide a comprehensive comparison of this track to the rest of her discography. What I can tell you, however, is that this is truly an insanely catchy track that’ll make you want to get up and dance. Or, at the very least, tap your fingers and forget about the bleak winter weather. At the track’s start, a muffled voice repeats the phrase “dancing on, I keep” six times (think the intro to Beyoncé’s “I’M THAT GIRL”) until interjected by the line “gonna be at, I know, gonna be at the door.” Not only does the intro just sound fun, but the unbothered lyrics reflect the carefree feeling of the beat, inspiring one to get up and keep dancing. Then, at 30 seconds, Grande gives us a welcome beat drop. And I mean a beat drop. Clearly already aware of the fact that “yes, and?” will be blasted on the dance floor, Ariana released an extended version of the track three days after the original release that boasts a whopping 80-second intro, heightening the allure of the opening even further. Moving into the first verse, Grande makes the observation “In case you haven’t noticed / Well, everybody’s tired / And healin’ from somebody / Or somethin’ we don’t see just right.” Although not exactly an astute commentary on the human condition, these lines convey the all-too-recognizable exhaustion that stems from constantly having stuff going on in our lives. Grande continues, instructing, “If you find yourself in a dark situation / Just turn on your light and be like / ‘Yes, and?’” This advice is rather idealistic (and certainly oversimplified), but is it not refreshing to think that we do have the power to just “turn on [our] light[s]” when faced with troubles? The titular phrase “yes, and?” radiates total self-confidence, strongly asserting that we should own our actions and exclaim “so what?” to our critics or haters. “yes, and?” heavily interpolates and structurally resembles Madonna’s iconic 1990 hit “Vogue.” This fact is immediately recognizable from the moment you press play, given both songs’ similar extended intros and near-identical tempos, with “Vogue” clocking in at a speedy 116 bpm and “yes, and?” at 119 bpm. Yet the parallels stretch far beyond their sound. “Vogue” was a landmark release for the queer community given its hailing of individuality and self-expression, as well as its titular reference to the ballroom scene. 34 years later, “yes, and?” unashamedly seeks to parallel Madonna’s sentiment of liberation, and does so triumphantly. “Vogue” opens with the whisper “What are you looking at?” an almost identical sentiment to Grande’s defiant line of “yes, and?” The similarities don’t end there—when the first verse of “Vogue” kicks in, Madonna sings, “Look around, everywhere you turn is heartache / It’s everywhere that you go.” These lyrical similarities demonstrate how Grande was inspired to reiterate Madonna’s recognition of the fatigue and negativity that so often surround us. Both songs also urge us to turn inward and feel happy by really feeling ourselves. But just feeling good is not enough—they want us to move. Madonna told us in 1990 to “let your body move to the music,” and Grande tells us in 2024 to “keep moving,” highlighting the power of dance to help us escape from the worries of the world. Grande made sure to reiterate the sentiment of queer liberation at the heart of Madonna’s track. She calls out in the first verse “Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (no one can tell you nothin’),” clearly referencing queer celebration and defiance. This is not a new sentiment to Grande: her 2020 collaboration with Lady Gaga on “Rain On Me” is a prominent example of how many of her tracks are hailed as queer anthems. In this light, the whole track is an ode to the queer experience and a signal of Grande’s acceptance of her iconic status within the queer community. She adamantly tells the listener to be their authentic self, and to do so unapologetically. Toward the song’s end, Grande descends from her trademark belts to huskily speak the lines, “My tongue is sacred, I speak upon what I like / Protected, sexy, discerning with my time.” She radiates a grounded self-confidence reminiscent of those Headspace mindfulness techniques (IYKYK) where you envisage yourself in a bubble, at peace with yourself and your surroundings. And yet, she adds a sexy and confident aura into the mix that feels oh-so-necessary. As she sings, “your energy is yours and mine is mine,” Grande encourages us to stay in our own lane, protect ourselves, and not succumb to others’ negative energy. Instead, as she repeats in the chorus, “be your own fucking best friend.” The track’s message is clear: be proud of yourself, be unapologetically who you are, and just get up and dance!
