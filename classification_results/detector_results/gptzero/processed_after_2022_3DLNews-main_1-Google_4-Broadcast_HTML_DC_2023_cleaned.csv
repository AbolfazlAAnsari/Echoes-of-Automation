Chairman Martin Gruenberg is sitting for a second day of grilling on Capitol Hill, this time at the Senate Banking Committee, The second of two large spending packages keeps agencies funded for the rest of 2024. The bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. Congress has sent President Joe Biden a short-term spending bill that would avert a looming partial government shutdown and fund federal agencies into March. New guidance from lead cybersecurity agencies and industry partners provides both individual developers and large companies with software supply chain security best practices Congress has ended the threat of a government shutdown until after the holidays. The Senate gave final approval to a temporary government funding package Wednesday night and sent it to President Joe Biden for his signature. The bill sets up a final confrontation on the government budget in the new year. The Senate worked into the night to pass the bill with days to spare before government funding expires Saturday. The spending package keeps government funding levels at current levels for roughly two more months while a long-term package is negotiated. The threat of a federal government shutdown ended late Saturday night after Congress approved a temporary funding bill to keep federal agencies open until Nov. 17. The bill passed just hours before the midnight deadline and President Joe Biden quickly signed it. He called it “good news for the American people.” The package drops aid for Ukraine but adds money for U.S. disaster assistance. House approval came after Speaker Kevin McCarthy abandoned plans for steep spending cuts and relied on Democratic help. Biden said he expects McCarthy to keep “his commitment” to the Ukrainian people and push for aid “at this critical moment” in the war with Russia. Allies of Speaker Kevin McCarthy are working furiously to shore up support for the latest Republican plan to prevent a government shutdown. President Joe Biden has nominated a former Obama administration official to lead the Federal Aviation Administration, which has been without a permanent leader for a year and a half. The White House said Thursday that Biden has nominated Michael Whitaker. He's currently the chief operating officer of a Hyundai affiliate that is working to develop an air taxi aircraft. The FAA faces a number of challenges including a shortage of air traffic controllers, aging technology, and alarm over close calls between planes. Whitaker worked at TWA and United Airlines, then was deputy FAA administrator from 2013 to 2016. Congressional leaders are pitching a stopgap government funding package to avoid a federal shutdown after next month. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy raised the idea to House Republicans on a members-only call. On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the two leaders had spoken about such a temporary measure. It's an acknowledgement the Republican-led House and Democratic Senate are nowhere near agreement on spending levels. The fiscal year starts Oct. 1, when funding will be needed. The stopgap measure would fund operations into December but McCarthy needs support from Republicans who are loathe to agree as they push for steeper cuts. State Sen. John Scott, a longtime South Carolina lawmaker who served in state government for more than three decades, has died after a stint in the hospital. In a statement released by Senate President Thomas Alexander, Scott’s family says he “passed away peaceably while surrounded by family and close friends.” He was 69. Scott had been at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston since Friday when he was hospitalized for an undisclosed medical issue, according to Senate officials. The Columbia Democrat operated a realty company and had been in the Legislature for more than 30 years. A special election will be held to fill his seat. President Joe Biden has praised leaders from both parties for unifying behind veterans a year ago, when they joined in passing the largest expansion of veterans benefits in decades. The PACT Act is intended to improve health care and disability compensation for exposure to toxic substances, such as burn pits used to dispose of trash on military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan. More than 348,000 veterans have had their claims approved in the last year. An additional 111,000 who are believed to have toxic exposure have enrolled in health care. The president and Utah's Republic governor, Spencer Cox, joined in Salt Lake City on Thursday to speak about the act on its anniversary. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules to require public companies to disclose within four days all cybersecurity breaches that could affect their bottom lines. Delays will be permitted if immediate disclosure poses serious national security or public safety risks. The new rules, passed by a 3-2 vote on Wednesday, also require publicly traded companies to annually disclose information on their cybersecurity risk management and executive expertise in the field. Hugh “Sonny” Carter Jr. has died. He's the Carter who helped organize the “Peanut Brigade” that helped elect his cousin Jimmy to the White House and later enforced the president’s frugal ways in the West Wing. The Carter Center announced his death without saying the cause. Hugh Carter was among the many extended family members who campaigned alongside Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter and their children early in the 1976 presidential campaign, when the Georgia Democrat was considered a longshot candidate. The 39th president then assigned Hugh Carter the task of curtailing waste among White House staffers, a job that earned him the nickname “Cousin Cheap.” The White House has nominated a career airlift and cargo pilot with key deployments in Afghanistan and Europe to serve as the Air Force's next top general. In a notice to Congress posted Wednesday, the White House nominated Gen. David W. Allvin to serve as the service's next chief of staff. Need help accessing the FCC Public File due to a disability?

The Department of Veterans Affairs is looking at facial recognition technology for its frontline medical workers to log into their workstations more quickly, and spend more time treating veterans. VA Chief Information Security Officer Lynette Sherrill said the department plans on piloting facial recognition tools next year at VA hospitals, particularly for frontline clinicians working in intensive care units. The pilot, if successful, would give VA health care employees an alternative to using their Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards to securely log onto the department’s network. “I’ve got nurses and clinicians trying to care for veterans. And they’ve got to reach for a PIV card … and plug it into a workstation to log in, while they’re trying to give a veteran a shot or give a patient an exam. So if I can make that a more frictionless authentication experience for them, I feel like that’s my job to help them,” Sherrill said Nov. 7 at the Rise8’s Prodacity summit in Washington, D.C. Join us June 25 and 26 at 1 p.m. EST for Federal News Network's Cloud Exchange, presented by Maximus, where we'll explore civilian agency progress in using the cloud to improve digital services and federal missions. | Register today! Sherrill told Federal News Network on the sidelines of the event that the VA plans to run facial recognition pilots throughout 2024 with clinical staff. “Much like we use facial recognition to log into an iPhone today, that’s that type of experience we want to give VA clinical staff,” she said in an interview. Sherrill said there’s already a high rate of PIV card utilization among the VA workforce. About 95% of employees, she added, are using their PIV cards to log onto the VA network. But even with those metrics, that means roughly 30,000 VA employees are logging on only with a username and password. Sherrill said the facial recognition pilot is focused on providing a “more frictionless authentication process” for VA clinical staff. “The technology is finally there, where we can utilize the technology to provide a better experience for our end users,” she said. Carrie Lee, VA’s deputy chief information officer for product engineering service, told Federal News Network that she’s heading up the department’s new identity, credential and access management (ICAM) modernization efforts. “We’re looking at our single sign-on experiences for both internal and external users, making sure that we are using multifactor [authentication], and making it compliant, making it an easy experience for the users,” Lee said. Read more: IT Modernization For external users, Lee said VA is using Login.gov and transitioning off of legacy credentials that only require a username and password, and may not be as secure. The VA is also setting a new standard for cybersecurity across its networks. VA is shifting some of its systems to a continuous Authority to Operate (ATO). It’s a trend that’s already happening across the Defense Department. The idea is VA will keep checking in to make sure its systems uphold cybersecurity requirements, rather than just checking off that those standards are met once before their launch. “We have quarterly reviews that review the security posture of every application within that continuous ATO, where I can click down and see how many risks were mitigated, how many vulnerabilities did we keep from being released into production,” Lee said. “I can go in at any point, and understand what’s happening in that environment for multiple applications.” Sherrill said the continuous ATO marks a step toward the VA having an “automated enterprise risk view” across its network. “With the ever-changing threat landscape that we’re dealing with in cybersecurity today, one of the things that is very hard to keep up with is how is the risk posture of all of our systems changing,” she said. Sign up for our daily newsletter so you never miss a beat on all things federal Sherrill added that the VA, with its new automated cybersecurity tools, will be able to respond more quickly to zero-day vulnerabilities and other emerging threats. “What this integration and automation is going to [is] … we’d know immediately, ‘These are our six most critical systems impacted by this zero-day vulnerability.’ And we’d be able to focus our resources on those systems, to make sure that we could maintain a risk posture that’s acceptable to the organization,” she said. Lee said the continuous ATO will also allow VA’s IT workforce to develop code and software more quickly, and spend less time on manual cybersecurity compliance work. “It also frees up a lot of people from manually entering into our [governance, risk and compliance] systems the compliance information, which can take a lot of resources, to be able to focus on higher value valuable tasks, such as actually developing systems,” Lee said. Lee said the VA has more than 1,000 systems with an ATO. Of those, she said she’s the authorizing official for about 400 of them. She said she spends about an hour each week authorizing systems. “VA is an extremely complex organization. We’re probably the largest IT infrastructure of any civilian federal agency,” Lee said. “I really need to understand the security of the system I’m looking at the time I look at it. So, the assurance of having those automated controls in place, and understanding that technical risk posture, instead of just the compliance is very important to me, from an authorizing official perspective.” Lee said the VA has reduced the ATO process from 400 days to about 60 days for new products coming into the environment. VA’s Office of Information and Technology (VA OIT) is also taking steps to make sure its employees are incorporating cybersecurity into the foundation of everything in development. Sherrill said no VA OIT development team is allowed to publish “any critical or high vulnerabilities in code.” “We understand very uniformly that you can no longer produce a quality system if it’s not secure. And that’s our mantra at VA now — if it’s not secure, it’s not quality code, it’s not a quality product, so you’ve got to go back to the drawing board,” she said. The VA is also focused on bringing in the next generation of cyber workers. “We’ve got to use nontraditional hiring methods and nontraditional people and get them interested in cybersecurity,” Sherrill said. “We’ve got cybersecurity people leaving the cybersecurity industry because of burnout. We have to stop doing that. We’ve got to figure out how do we fill that pipeline back.” Sherrill told Federal News Network that the VA is looking at ways to partner with the Defense Department’s SkillBridge program, which places transitioning service members into civilian careers. “If I can bring in transitioning service members who already have cyber skills, and they’re transitioning out of the service, and I can give them a soft place to transition to and the VA and then give them two [or] three years of training, and they launch into industry — that’s a win,” she said. “But if they choose to stay in VA, and they get passionate about the mission, like most of us are in serving veterans, that’s a win as well.” Sherrill said the VA also sees potential in reaching out to military spouses to consider careers in cybersecurity. “They have an aptitude that they uniquely bring into the field, and I think that’s an untapped resource for us.
