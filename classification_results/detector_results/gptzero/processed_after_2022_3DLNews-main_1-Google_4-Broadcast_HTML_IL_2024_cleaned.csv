The Senate Energy Committee held the second hearing this week examining the administration’s planned pause that has been met with stiff resistance from Republicans and some moderate Democrats. David Turk, Energy Department deputy secretary, defended the administration’s decision in front of senators on Thursday. The United States’ LNG capacity has doubled in recent years and is set to double once again under projects that have already been approved. It comes after the U.S. took over the top spot as the world’s largest LNG exporter last year and helped fill some gaps left by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which created an energy crunch as America and its European allies tried to reconfigure energy supply lines to punish Moscow. “In fact, I would find it irresponsible if we weren't taking a step back and undertaking this rigorous analysis,” Turk said. “The U.S. Department of Energy remains committed to keeping energy affordable for all Americans, strengthening energy security for us and for our allies and protecting against the worst impacts of climate change.” Turk said the administration is “very comfortable” about the EU’s energy supply moving forward as the pause does not stop current or approved projects and that the department is projecting demand to decrease over time. Energy Department officials and the White House have said the pause will allow the administration to study proposed projects for expanded production and what impact they will have on the environment and domestic energy stability. Some supporters of the plan have said that it will make domestic prices more sustainable. The natural gas industry has been vehemently opposed to the idea of a pause and said it would be a “win for Russia.” They have also voiced concerns that the pause could delay projects from coming online and disincentivize investment into production, which is expensive and takes years to develop into a functioning site. “After eight years of U.S. LNG exports, the benefits are no longer theoretical. The facts are clear U.S. LNG has been determined to be in the public interest. The decision to pause LNG export approvals could have far-reaching consequences, potentially jeopardizing international relationships, economic stability and progress towards our environmental objectives,” said Charles Riedl, executive director of the Center for LNG, a trade group. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said when it was announced that the pause wouldn’t have any immediate effect on gas supplies to Europe and Asia, but that has been met with a skeptical response and the pause has concerned European allies about their energy futures even though the European Commission has said it will not have any short- or medium-term effects on its security of its supply. “We feel that indeed, the U.S. and EU and the UK need to stand together when we're looking at Ukraine and the situation that we face there. And by not being able, perhaps, to honor the commitments that have been made in the United States towards its allies, you are going to indeed force us to continue to do business with Russia,” said Dr. James Watson, secretary general of Eurogas, a trade group for the European gas industry. Many European countries have had to continue to rely on Russia for energy needs despite sanctions and other penalties resulting from the war in Ukraine, but the region’s leaders are trying to reduce their dependence on Moscow. They have attributed a lot of the early successes to the expanded exports from American suppliers. Biden had been facing pressure from environmental groups and younger voters to slow the production of fossil fuels due to the connections between production and an increase in the emission of greenhouse gases that fuel global warming. Some industry groups and Republicans have accused Biden of acting for strictly political reasons in pursuing the pause. “That's what it is Mr. Chairman, a transparent, very transparent election-year payoff to appease radical environmentalist who want to end exports of American natural gas,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., and the committee’s ranking member. Sen. Joe Manchin, who has pushed for more U.S. production of fossil fuels and is a key swing vote in any Senate legislation, also accused the White House of playing politics with the decision to pause approvals. “The White House has shown it is so concerned with indulging radical climate activists and is willing to play politics with our energy security and that of our allies. This reminds me all too well of the administration's misguided unlawful pause on oil and gas leasing,” the West Virginia Democrat said. The pause on natural gas comes amid a back-and-forth relationship between Biden’s administration and the energy industry. While he has made some moves to prioritize the environment in his energy policy, he has also taken some steps to expand production like approving the controversial Willow oil drilling project in Alaska. While some lawmakers are hoping to act legislatively to prevent the pause, the bill would face a difficult path forward through a Democratic-controlled Senate and may be vetoed by the president.""}]"

Every month, like millions of Americans, Colbert juggled her costs. Pay rent or swim team fees for one of her three kids. Rent or school supplies. Rent or groceries. Colbert, a social worker who helps people stay financially afloat, would often arrive home to notices giving her 30 days to pay rent and a late fee or face eviction. “Every month you just gotta budget and then you still fall short,” she said, adding what became a monthly refrain: “Well, this month at least we have $13 left.” Millions of Americans, especially people of color, are facing those same, painful decisions as a record number struggle with unaffordable rent increases, a crisis fueled by rising prices from inflation, a shortage of affordable housing and the end of pandemic relief. The latest data from the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, released in January, found that a record high 22.4 million renter households — or half of renters nationwide — were spending more than 30% of their income on rent in 2022. The number of affordable units — with rents under $600 — also dropped to 7.2 million that year, 2.1 million fewer than a decade earlier. Those factors contributed to a dramatic rise in eviction filings and a record number of people becoming homeless. “It’s one of the worst years we’ve ever seen,” said Whitney Airgood-Obrycki, a senior research associate at the Harvard center, who added that the level of cost-burdened households in 2022 had not been seen since the Great Recession in 2008, when 10 million Americans lost their homes to foreclosure. After failing to make a significant dent in the problem over the last decade, state and federal lawmakers across the U.S. are making housing a priority in 2024 and throwing the kitchen sink at the issue — including proposals to enact eviction protections, institute zoning reforms, cap annual rent increases and dedicate tens of billions of dollars toward building more housing. The hardest hit have been renters who made less than $30,000, and who, after paying rent and utilities, were left with just $310 a month on average, Airgood-Obrycki said. “So you can certainly imagine the kinds of tradeoffs that have to happen,” she said. “Cost-burden renters are spending less on things like food and health care and retirement. So, there are significant implications for the long-term well-being of these households.” In Denver, Colbert’s bathroom roof partly caved in from a leak last year, and the landlord delayed a fix even as rent went up $200 a month. It was the last straw for Colbert, who moved in to live with family and is purchasing a home through Habitat for Humanity, which gave her a low-interest loan. “It’s so disheartening, paying so much and not even seeing where your rent is going,” Colbert said. “It just hits you like, ‘This is for nothing.’” In Auburn, Massachusetts, pervasive rent hikes have already hit the last bastion of affordable housing. Just off an interstate alongside a pond, residents at the American Mobile Home Park face rent increases upwards of 40%. Many tenants, mostly seniors and others on fixed incomes, haven’t signed new leases with those increases. The group Lawyers For Civil Rights has sent a letter to the landlord accusing it of “unconscionable rent increases,” and failing to provide critical services like adequate garbage and snow removal. “How am I going to pay that?” said Amy Case, 49, wondering how she’ll balance the $345 monthly increase with the $200 she has to spend on medications and the cost of a twice-yearly MRI to monitor her brain tumor. “I don’t know what else to cut back on,” said Case, an administrative assistant at a local college, who said she would only have $300 left over each month for other necessities. “Probably less groceries. I certainly can’t cut back on my medications.” Another tenant, 72-year-old Ann Urbanovitch, who works as a cashier at a department store, is facing a similar rent increase. “I expected it to go up $100, but $345. I was shocked,” she said. “I have to dip into my retirement savings … because, you know, times are tough.” The mobile home park owner, Parakeet Communities, did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for comment. With many families struggling to pay, landlords in Colorado are increasingly turning to evictions, with over 50,000 evictions filed last year, according to data from the Colorado Judicial Branch. “2023 was the high-water mark for evictions filings in recorded Colorado history,” said Zach Neumann, co-CEO of the Community Economic Defense Project, which offers financial and legal assistance to Colorado residents struggling with rent. Monique Gant, the mother of two boys, stuffed her belongings into boxes in a Denver suburb last week after losing a drawn-out eviction fight, planning to move between long-stay hotel rooms and her RV for now. Gant’s hair has thinned from the stress she buries beneath a stoic face for her children. “My kids, they assume that I am Super Woman,” said Gant. But “when I go to take a shower, put some music on, I cry.” Already, she said, her 10- and 11-year-old sons have been in fights at school and on the bus, and aren’t engaging with classes as they once did. About 40% of those facing eviction each year are children — some 2.9 million, according to a study co-authored by Nick Graetz at Princeton University’s Eviction Lab, who said research shows wide-ranging impacts of housing turbulence and eviction on children’s mental health and development. “We can see that things really fall off for children that experience eviction,” Graetz said. In Congress, lawmakers are working on a bill that would expand a federal program that awards tax credits to housing developers who agree to set aside units for low-income tenants. Supporters say that could lead to the construction of 200,000 more affordable homes. Some lawmakers are also calling for more rental assistance, including a significant increase in funding for housing vouchers. “A larger commitment from the federal government is required,” said Chris Herbert, managing director of the Harvard center. “Only then will the nation finally make a meaningful dent in the housing affordability crisis making life so difficult for millions of people.” At the state level, Colorado lawmakers have proposed a bill to limit the reasons for which a landlord can evict a tenant. Other bills would scrap the filing fee for tenants in an eviction case, and roll back local rules prohibiting homeowners from renting out a separate unit on their property. “If we don’t act now,” said Colorado Gov. Jared Polis in his state of the state speech last month, largely focused on housing, “we will soon face a spiraling point of no return.” Other states feel the same urgency. In Washington state, a bill would require that 10% of new housing around transit hubs be affordable for low-income residents. Another would bar landlords from increasing rent by more than 5% annually during a rental agreement term. In Massachusetts, a bill would invest over $4 billion toward building and shoring up affordable housing in response to the state’s estimate that more than 200,000 additional homes will be needed by 2030. It would be the largest housing investment in state history. However, it would come too late for the rent increase Urbanovitch faces to stay in her mobile home. “My biggest worry,” she said, “is not really having a place to move to. There’s no place to go.” Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Please enter a search term. by: Brad Dress, Brett Samuels, The Hill Posted: Jan 29, 2024 / 03:14 PM CST Updated: Jan 29, 2024 / 03:32 PM CST by: Brad Dress, Brett Samuels, The Hill Posted: Jan 29, 2024 / 03:14 PM CST Updated: Jan 29, 2024 / 03:32 PM CST The killing of three U.S. troops in Jordan by a drone strike carried out by Iranian-backed militant groups has added kindling to what is already a volatile situation in the Middle East, increasing pressure on President Biden to send a message to leaders in Tehran. It has left the White House facing the difficult balancing act of responding to Iran in ways that will deter future attacks but without triggering a wider conflict — something the Biden administration has been adamant about avoiding since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. But the attack in Jordan marked the first time that U.S. service members have been killed in the Middle East since the war in Gaza began in October, adding a new layer of complexity for the White House. “We do not seek another war. We do not seek to escalate. But we will absolutely do what is required to protect ourselves … and to respond appropriately to these attacks,” national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Monday. Biden has pledged to respond to the latest attacks in a “time and manner of our choosing.” The president met Monday with members of his national security team, including national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who returned to the Pentagon for the first time since undergoing surgery for prostate cancer. Kirby emphasized that the U.S. is not looking for a war with Iran, but when asked if Biden is considering a strike inside the country, he would not say whether it was on the table. “This attack over the weekend was escalatory, make no mistake about it. And it requires a response, make no mistake about that,” he said. “I will not get ahead of the president’s decisionmaking.” American troops have come under fire from Iranian-backed groups more than 160 times since late October. The White House has in recent weeks launched precision strikes targeting Iranian-backed militia targets and struck back against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen after the rebel group targeted commercial shipping in the Red Sea. But the death of U.S. troops will increase the stakes for Biden, particularly among Republican defense hawks in Congress who are already calling for retaliation, including inside Iran. Ali Vaez, director of the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, said if the U.S. wants to hold Iran responsible, it may target sites or facilities in Iraq or Syria used by the Iranian military wing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. But the U.S. will likely refrain from targeting Iranian soil, he added. “The dilemma here for the Biden administration is how to bloody Iran’s nose, which is something that this attack serves and calls for, but to do so without actually touching Iran’s nose,” Vaez said. “They don’t want to have to strike Iran on its own territory. And that’s a very difficult needle to thread.” The deaths sparked outrage in Washington and calls from some in the GOP for a more forceful response to Iran, the sponsor of the militia groups. Former President Trump, Biden’s likely GOP rival in November’s general election, blamed the attack on Biden’s “weakness” and claimed the U.S. was “on the brink of “World War 3.” Republican lawmakers similarly piled on, ripping the White House for failing to hold Iran accountable and urging Biden to take swift and decisive action in response. “Real leadership requires real action,” Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), chair of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. “Attacks on our servicemembers, allies, and interests will continue until this president shows strong leadership and strikes fear in our enemies.” Iran has denied involvement in the Jordan attack, claiming it does not issue direct orders to militia groups. The U.S. says Iran is broadly complicit for attacks from its proxies. Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said Monday the attack has the “footprints” of an Iranian-backed group in Iraq, Kata’ib Hezbollah, but didn’t make a final determination. She said the U.S. holds Iran responsible for the attack but avoided a question on how Tehran would be held responsible. Any U.S. response to Iran will likely be met with further retaliation from Iranian-backed groups in a continuous cycle until the Israeli war in Gaza ends. The Iranian-linked groups say they are fighting against American troops in solidarity with the Palestinians. Barbara Slavin, a distinguished fellow at the Stimson Center and an expert on the Middle East, said the Jordan attacks are a “dangerous escalation” and predicted a heavy response from the U.S. on whichever group was responsible. But she said the U.S. already assassinated an Iranian-backed leader in Iraq earlier this month and carried out several destructive strikes, none of which has deterred more attacks. “I don’t know what more the U.S. can do that will somehow deter these strikes,” she said. “The only thing … that can deter the strikes is a cease-fire in Gaza, because these groups all claim that they’re acting in solidarity with the Palestinians.” Singh said the Pentagon does not plan to shift the strategy against Iranian-backed militants despite concerns that deterrence was failing to stop the attacks. “We are committed to responding, and we will do so at a time and place of our choosing,” Singh told reporters. With Iran expected to respond to any U.S. strike, the fighting could get deadlier for American troops, who have largely suffered traumatic brain injuries or minor wounds in the attacks. Some attacks have had close calls, including one on Christmas Day in Iraq that severely wounded an American service member. And a drone crashed into an American base in Erbil, Iraq, in late October but didn’t explode. If it had, the U.S. likely would have suffered fatalities. Slavin said the sheer number of attacks of Iranian-backed militia groups on the U.S. meant a fatal strike was only a matter of time. “This was a tragedy that in hindsight, looks to have been inevitable,” she said. “Whenever you’re engaged in this kind of activity, the risk that you’re going to actually kill someone is always there.” Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

What important dates and facts you should know before hitting the polls. ROCKFORD, Ill. — Primary elections are finally here, with Stateline residents hitting the polls until election day on March 19th. As we move into an intense cycle, election officials are urging the importance of voting in a primary election. ""We\'ve had a lot of races in Winnebago County over the last several years and the outcome is often determined by a very small margin,"" said Winnebago County Clerk, Lori Gummow. ""Every vote is important, and it really matters."" With early voting starting on February 8th, it is important to know about the deadlines to ensure you are set up for success, including early mail - in voting. The deadline to request early mail - in voting is March 14th, and as long as your ballot is postmarked by March 19th, your vote will be counted. The first week of early voting, the Winnebago County Clerk is estimating over 5,000 ballots are mailed. As far as in-person voting goes, residents of Rockford can vote early at the Rockford Board Of Election office, and residents in Winnebago County outside of Rockford can vote at the Winnebago County Clerk\'s office. On election day, March 19th, you must vote at your polling location, which is listed on your registration card. If you are not registered to vote, you can still register by February 20th, with the grace period beginning on February 21st. If you register to vote during the grace period, you must cast your vote at the same time that you register. ""When I look back at the historical information from the previous presidential year, in the primary, not as many people came out and cast their votes,"" said Gummow. ""Now on this ballot in certain areas, especially in South Beloit, we have a referendum question... a lot of times that\'s a financial impact upon those voters."" According to Gummow, not voting in a primary election can make a substantial difference locally that can impact sales tax. For this year, the City Of South Beloit has a referendum question on the ballot that allows citizens to vote for raising the sales tax from one to two percent over the next five years. With already $1.39 million already going towards road infrastructure, the sales tax could bring about $1 million more to support over 10 road projects. ""It\'s to designate strictly to roads, it doesn\'t go towards sidewalks, it doesn\'t go towards any other item in our general fund, it would 100% be committed for roads,"" said Sonya Hoppes, the City Administrator for the City Of South Beloit. ""As motor fuel tax goes down, our problem with roads are going to continue to go up.""

It is Putin’s first interview to a Western media figure since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Carlson had released a video from Moscow on Tuesday in which he said he would be interviewing Putin. Carlson claimed that Western journalists had interviewed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy multiple times but could not be “bothered” to interview the Russian president. The interview will be posted Thursday, according to Justin Wells, head of programming at Carlson’s streaming network. It’s not known what was said in the interview. Putin has heavily limited his contact with international media since he launched the war in Ukraine in February 2022. Russian authorities have cracked down on media, forcing some independent Russian outlets to close, blocking others and ordering a number of foreign reporters to leave the country. Two journalists working for U.S. news organizations — The Wall Street Journal’s Evan Gershkovich and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Alsu Kurmasheva — are in jail on charges they reject. Western journalists were invited to Putin’s annual press conference in December — the first since the war began — but only two were given the chance to ask a question. Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters that Carlson was chosen for the interview because “he has a position which differs” from other English-language media. Before his exit from Fox, Carlson repeatedly questioned the validity of U.S. support for Ukraine following the Russian invasion, and he’s wondered why Americans are told to hate Putin so much. His commentaries were frequently circulated on Russian state-run media. In his video this week, Carlson denounced “corrupt” American media outlets for “fawning pep sessions” with Zelenskyy that he said were designed to get America into a war with eastern Europe and pay for it. Peskov also rejected Carlson’s suggestion that no Western journalists had submitted requests to interview Putin. He said the Kremlin has received many requests from large Western television channels and newspapers which, he asserted, “take a one-sided position.” Carlson’s position, Peskov said, “is in no way pro-Russian, nor pro-Ukrainian, but rather pro-American.” The Associated Press is among the outlets that has requested an interview with Putin. “Does Tucker really think we journalists haven’t been trying to interview President Putin every day since his full scale invasion of Ukraine?” CNN’s Christiane Amanpour said on X. “It’s absurd — we’ll continue to ask for an interview, just as we have for years now.” Carlson’s trip comes as he has planted himself on former President Donald Trump’s side in a growing split in the Republican party over Putin and the Ukraine war. Trump has pushed to cut off aid to Ukraine, and the GOP majority controlling the House of Representatives has complied. While many Republicans are critical of the Russian president and his invasion, Trump and others have argued the United States has no interest helping Ukraine defend itself. Carlson has also traveled to interview Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has fashioned himself into an icon for conservative populists across the globe and been Putin’s closest ally in the European Union. The interview with Putin, Carlson said in his video, will be distributed for free on his website and on X, formerly known as Twitter. Carlson, who was fired by Fox News in April, announced he was starting his own streaming service in December. Fox has offered no explanation for firing Carlson, who was its top-rated personality at the time. Like many people who leave the network that is conservative America’s most popular news outlet, he has struggled to remain in the public eye. Carlson worked at Fox News for more than a decade and hosted a show where he discussed conspiracy theories about Russia and the Jan. 6 insurrection. Russian state media on Wednesday extensively covered Carlson’s visit. Vladimir Solovyev, one of Russia’s most famous television hosts, said the interview would “break through the blockade and the narrative that exists” in Western media which, he said, focuses on “Putin’s unprovoked, brutal invasion of Ukraine.” Solovyev, whose show is often critical of Western media, said Carlson is “feared” because he does not align with that narrative. ___ Associated Press writer Nicholas Riccardi contributed to this report.

Please enter a search term. by: Joseph Choi, The Hill Posted: Jan 30, 2024 / 11:19 AM CST Updated: Jan 30, 2024 / 11:19 AM CST by: Joseph Choi, The Hill Posted: Jan 30, 2024 / 11:19 AM CST Updated: Jan 30, 2024 / 11:19 AM CST (The Hill) — A group of Democratic senators on Tuesday called on the Biden administration to completely deschedule marijuana, arguing the White House’s recommendations to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to reschedule the drug does not go far enough to address the harm that has occurred from the current system. In a letter addressed to Attorney General Merrick Garland and DEA Administrator Anne Milgram, eleven Democratic senators, along with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), argued the administration “should deschedule marijuana altogether.” “Marijuana’s placement in the [Controlled Substances Act] has had a devastating impact on our communities and is increasingly out of step with state law and public opinion,” they wrote. The letter was signed by Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), John Fetterman (Penn.), Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), Cory Booker (N.J.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Ron Wyden (Ore.), John Hickenlooper (Colo.), Peter Welch (Vt.), Chris Van Hollen (Md.) and Alex Padilla (Calif.). Last year, the Department of Health and Human Services sent recommendations to the DEA to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I, the category designated to drugs with no accepted medical use and a high risk of abuse, to Schedule III. The DEA is currently conducting its own review of marijuana scheduling. The lawmakers cited recently disclosed documents in which HHS acknowledged that marijuana likely does not meet the criteria to be considered Schedule I. They also pointed out that nearly half of all states in the U.S. have legalized recreational marijuana use since the last time the drug’s scheduling was considered in 2016. International bodies like the World Health Organization, physician groups in the U.S., and public opinion all support marijuana legalization to some extent, the senators noted. “The case for removing marijuana from Schedule I is overwhelming. The DEA should do so byAlthough HHS recommended rescheduling, its analysis could support a decision to deschedule— particularly its emphasis on the fact that marijuana has less adverse outcomes (including lesspotential of an overdose) and less potential of abuse than substances that are descheduled alcohol) or scheduled below Schedule III (such as benzodiazepines),” they wrote. Rescheduling marijuana is not the same as decriminalizing it, something President Biden promised to do once in office. Proponents of marijuana legalization have criticized a potential rescheduling as a move that would more so benefit marijuana business owners — most of whom are white — in being able to deduct business expenses from their taxes, rather than actually helping rectify racial injustices fueled by marijuana’s scheduling. “These harms could be remedied only through fully descheduling marijuana. Once descheduled, marijuana can still be subject to public health regulations, drawing from lessons learned through the regulation of alcohol and tobacco,” the senators said in their letter Tuesday. The lawmakers requested that the DEA respond to questions regarding where the current review of rescheduling stands, what evidence the agency is using, what the timeline looks like, how criminal enforcement would change after a potential rescheduling and whether the agency is taking into account the harms of marijuana criminalization. The DEA and the office of the Attorney General did not immediately respond when reached for comment. Submit Δ Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Trump’s delay tactics are a well-worn strategy by the former president and his legal teams to bend circumstances in his favor. And now, with an appeals court weighing whether he’s protected from prosecution by presidential immunity, Trump’s goal of facing voters before he faces a federal jury is growing likelier with the judge issuing a full stop on trial proceedings in Washington until that determination is made. “I am officially now at the freakout stage,” Obama-era acting U.S. Solicitor General Neal Katyal told MSNBC on Sunday. Anticipation had run high that the three-judge D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel would rule quickly, as the panel agreed to expedite the case and directed the attorneys to file their written briefs on the Saturdays preceding Christmas and New Year’s, no less. But four weeks after oral arguments, the panel has still not handed down their decision. Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has issued a full stop on the trial proceedings, indefinitely delaying Trump’s trial once set for March 4. That only bolsters Trump’s strategy to run out the clock and potentially pardon himself of the federal charges should he again win the White House, sidelining prosecution before a conviction. The stalling has thrown anti-Trump legal pundits into full spiral, warning that it could only help the likely GOP nominee who is polling, at times, neck and neck with President Biden. Norm Eisen, counsel for the Democrats in Trump’s first impeachment, called the lack of a ruling a “temporary win” for the former president. “We’ve been waiting, clock’s running, we’ve been waiting almost four weeks,” Eisen said on CNN over the weekend. “I think we’ll get something from them. I hope we’ll get something from them soon,” he added. Recent surveys have somewhat tipped the scale in terms of how voters feel about casting a ballot for Trump should he be convicted before Election Day. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll last week found more than half of battleground state voters, including nearly a quarter, or 23 percent, of Republicans, would not vote for Trump should he be convicted. That figure rises to 55 percent should Trump be sentenced to prison. A CNN poll this week found that most voters want to see prosecution of the election subversion case before voting in November. Trump was charged with four counts in August alleging he conspired to overturn the 2020 election and spurred his supporters to disrupt the Jan. 6, 2021, congressional certification of the results, one of four indictments he faces. Trump pleaded not guilty to all the charges. For one of his pretrial defenses in the Jan. 6 case, Trump has contended he has criminal immunity for official acts during his presidency. Chutkan, an appointee of former President Obama, rejected that argument, bringing the novel constitutional issue before the three-judge D.C. Circuit panel. During the hour-plus oral argument last month — at which Trump was present — the panel appeared unconvinced by Trump’s lawyers’ claims that a president can’t be prosecuted if not first impeached and convicted by Congress. But the three judges, one former President George H.W. Bush appointee and two President Biden appointees, did signal at least some disagreement, leaving the exact contours of their ruling a mystery. The court has been silent ever since. With no formal rules to force a judge to release its decision quicker, the nature of the internal deliberations — and the reason behind the holdup — remain unclear. “At what point does the DC Circuit Chief Judge speak to Judge Henderson to politely tell her to SNAPADOODLE in the Trump immunity decision? I’d say, about a week ago!” Andrew Weissmann, a prosecutor for special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. A decision in the coming days would still be speedy compared with the D.C. Circuit’s normal operations. Nonexpedited cases typically take months to progress through the process. To keep his election subversion case on track, special counsel Jack Smith sought to avoid timing complications at the D.C. Circuit by asking the Supreme Court to leapfrog the process and immediately take up the immunity issue. But the justices rejected the request, so Smith will now have to race against the clock, with the future of his prosecution potentially on the line. One way or another, the immunity issue is widely expected to eventually land at the Supreme Court. But first, the side that loses before the three-judge D.C. Circuit panel could eat up additional time by asking the full appeals court bench to reconsider the ruling. If the case does eventually move ahead after the appeals process is exhausted, Trump’s trial still won’t be immediate, with the judges still needing to consider an array of pretrial motions, which could take weeks or months. And once the case does reach trial? Smith previously projected the government’s case will take four to six weeks to present. Altogether, a possible verdict is inching toward the vicinity of the Nov. 5 presidential election — or even afterwards. “I have no idea what the Court of Appeals is doing right now,” Katyal told MSNBC. “This is a real problem,” he added.
