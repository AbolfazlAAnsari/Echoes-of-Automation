But since Oct. 17, as civilian deaths in Israel's war against Hamas began to skyrocket, there has been a dramatic spike in attacks by Iran's proxies, operating under the umbrella name of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. While most of the more than five dozen attacks have been largely ineffective, at least 60 U.S. personnel have reported minor injuries. Most often those have been traumatic brain injuries from the explosions, and all troops have returned to duty, according to the Pentagon. In response to the attacks, the U.S. has walked a delicate line. The U.S. military has struck back just three times as the Biden administration balances efforts to deter the militants without triggering a broader Middle East conflict. A look at the attacks and the U.S. response: ATTACKS — WHEN, WHERE, WHY According to the Pentagon, Iranian-backed militants have launched 61 attacks on bases and facilities housing U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17. Of those, 29 have been in Iraq and 32 in Syria. The U.S. has about 2,000 U.S. forces in Iraq, under an agreement with the Baghdad government, and about 900 in Syria, mainly to counter IS but also using the al-Tanf garrison farther south to keep tabs on Iranian proxies moving weapons across the border. The latest jump in attacks began 10 days after Hamas' Oct. 7 incursion into Israel, where at least 1,200 people were killed. Israel’s blistering military response has killed thousands of civilians trapped in Gaza and fueled threats of retaliation by a range of Iran-backed groups, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Yemen-based Houthis, and militants in Iraq and Syria. Those threats escalated after an Oct. 17 blast at a Gaza hospital killed hundreds of civilians. Hamas blamed Israel for the explosion, but Israel has denied it, and both Israeli and U.S. officials have blamed it on a missile misfire by Islamic Jihad. The bulk of the attacks on bases and facilities have been with one-way suicide drones or rockets, and in most cases there were no injuries and only minor damage. A significant number of the injuries, particularly the traumatic brain injuries, were in the initial attacks between Oct. 17 and 21 at al-Asad air base in Iraq and al-Tanf. One U.S. contractor suffered a cardiac arrest and died while seeking shelter from a possible drone attack. WHO ARE THESE GROUPS? With a power vacuum and years of civil conflict following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, militias grew and multiplied in Iraq, some supported by Iran. A decade later, as the Islamic State extremist group swept across Iraq, a number of Iran-backed militias came together under the Popular Mobilization Forces umbrella group and fought IS. The groups included the Asaib Ahl al-Haq, the Badr Brigades and Kataeb Hezbollah, or Hezbollah Brigades — a separate group from the Lebanese Hezbollah. A number of the Iraqi militias also operate in Syria, where Iran supports the government of Bashar Assad against opposition groups in the uprising-turned-civil-war that began in 2011. After the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, a group of the Iran-backed factions branded itself under the new Islamic Resistance in Iraq name, and began the latest spate of attacks on bases housing U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. The attacks put Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in a difficult position. While he came to power with the Iranian-backed groups' support, he also wants continued good relations with the U.S. and has backed the ongoing presence of American troops in his country. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in a meeting with al-Sudani this month, warned of consequences if Iranian-backed militias continued to attack U.S. facilities in Iraq and Syria. Al-Sudani then traveled to Tehran and met with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a meeting U.S. officials suggested was a positive development. An official with one of the Iranian-backed militias said al-Sudani put “great pressure” on the militias not to carry out attacks during Blinken's visit. In return, he said, al-Sudani promised to push the Americans not to retaliate aggressively against militias that have carried out the strikes. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly. PROPORTIONAL OR NOT ENOUGH? Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, the Biden administration has moved warships, fighter jets, air defense systems and more troops into the Middle East in a campaign to discourage militant groups from widening the conflict. But the U.S. military response to the attacks on its forces has been minimal. On Oct. 27, U.S. fighter jets struck two weapons and ammunition storage sites in eastern Syria near Boukamal that were used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iranian-backed groups. On Nov. 8, fighter jets dropped bombs on an IRGC weapons storage facility near Maysulun in Deir el-Zour. And on Nov. 12, U.S. airstrikes targeted a training facility and a safe house in the Bulbul district of Mayadin. U.S. officials said IRGC-related personnel were there and likely struck, but provided no details. There are concerns within the administration that more substantial retaliation could escalate the violence and trigger more deadly attacks. The Pentagon says the strikes have degraded the group's military stockpiles and made the sites unusable. But critics argue that the U.S. response pales in comparison with the 60 attacks and American injuries, and — more importantly — has obviously failed to deter the groups. IRAQ GOVERNMENT SENSITIVITIES Though nearly half of the attacks have been on U.S. bases in Iraq, the U.S. has conducted retaliatory airstrikes only against locations in Syria. The Pentagon defends the strike decisions by saying the U.S. is hitting Iranian Revolutionary Guard sites, which has a more direct impact on Tehran. Officials say the goal is to pressure Iran to tell the militia groups to stop the attacks. They also say the sites are chosen because they are weapons warehouses and logistical hubs used by the Iran-linked militias, and taking them out erodes the insurgents' attack capabilities. A key reason the U.S. is concentrating on Syria, however, is that the U.S. doesn't want to risk alienating the Iraqi government by striking within its borders — potentially killing or wounding Iraqis. In early January 2020, the U.S. launched an airstrike in Baghdad, killing Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq. The strike frayed relations with the Iraqi government and spawned demands for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from the country. The U.S. considers its presence in Iraq as critical to the fight against IS, its ability to support forces in Syria and its ongoing influence in the region. Military leaders have worked to restore good relations with Baghdad, including providing ongoing support for Iraqi forces. ____ Associated Press writer Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad contributed to this report.

Photo: OhioSAR.org While kids are taught all about stranger danger, they might not think a person is a stranger if that person knows their name. Sites where the stickers can be purchased even suggest against putting names under figures on the decals, but many people just ignore the warning. Because of all the danger, police are now urging car owners to not put up stickers that give away personal information.

passing of a resolution to condemn Hamas, amid a walkout protest for Palestine. Find the transcript below. JOYCE: On Wednesday, November 15th, the Associated Students of UCSB Senate convened at Corwin Pavilion for their weekly meeting, where they discussed two major resolutions, S.R. 7-101A and S.R. 6-101B: one to condemn Hamas, and one to condemn both antisemitism and Islamophobia. The Senate session culminated in a walkout and the passing of only one of those resolutions. ZOHA: I’m Zoha Malik. JOYCE: And I’m Joyce Chi. ZOHA: We were at that meeting. Here’s what we observed. JOYCE: First off – it’s important to note that originally, there was only one resolution, S.R. 6-101, condemning both Hamas and antisemitism. AS Senators say that after reaching out to campus organizations and hearing students’ comments during public forum, they decided to split the resolution into two and to add a condemnation of Islamophobia. ZOHA: The original resolution’s student sponsors did not include a single Muslim or Arab cultural student group. It did, however, include representatives from several pro-Israel groups, including Tamid, an internship program in Israel, Chabad, a Jewish outreach and awareness group, the AS Jewish Commission, and Students Supporting Israel. JOYCE: The original resolution, brought by AS Senators Coleton Cristiani, Michelle Lebowski, Mia Goren, and Ephraim Shalunov, was S.R. 6-10, which denounced, quote, “the hateful rhetoric of pro-Hamas student groups.” Many Palestinian advocates felt the resolution falsely equated the goals of Palestinian liberation with Hamas as a whole. ZOHA: Dozens of undergrads stated their concerns during long public comment periods at recent Senate meetings. JOYCE: Though the original resolution stated AS would, quote, “mourn all civilian loss of life in Israel and Gaza as a result of the ensuing war” following the October 7th attacks, it was also criticized for not specifically condemning Israel’s military campaigns in Gaza, which have since killed over 11,000 Palestinians. One attendee told us that was what they wanted to see from the Senate – a resolution condemning Israel’s disproportionate retaliatory actions. ZOHA: Another criticism focuses on the original resolution’s clause against misinformation. In spite of that, quote, “vehement condemnation of misinformation,” during a Senate meeting on November 8th, Senators Cristiani and Shalunov mentioned unverified claims when talking about their support of the resolution, including, respectively, of beheaded babies and of fetuses cut out from a pregnant woman. JOYCE: Now, back to the AS resolutions. The Senate meeting was slated to begin at 6:30, but due to issues with the Zoom livestream, it began closer to 7 PM. They also did not get recorded audio of the first thirty or forty minutes of the meeting. At times, the audio cut out, either due to technical difficulties or someone muting the livestream. The Senate would later be criticized, especially by the AS Commission on Disability Equity, or CODE, for failing to make proper accessibility accommodations for audiences listening at home. ZOHA: Later, Dan Siddiqqui of CODE brought up these accessibility concerns and asked the Senators who just spoke to summarize what they had said while the video was down. JOYCE: Though brief summaries were supplied, some Senators voiced concerns about time, as they were already an hour or two behind schedule. Senator Shalunov spoke about Siddiqqui’s request, saying, quote, “asking me to summarize everything I’ve said when everything I’ve said is on the minutes, has been recorded, and will be released… is obstructionism, designed to prevent us from getting to a vote.” ZOHA: Here’s Dan Siddiqqui talking about this. [Dan Siddiqui at the walk-out] “I respectfully asked… The Zoom was not working for over two hours. There were over 40 UCSB students [waiting to listen over Zoom.] I respectfully asked could the Senators who made statements that lasted over an hour long, please, at the very least, give a short summary of these statements or repeat them for the entirety of the statements that they made, so that the individuals on Zoom can have an understanding of what was going on, before public forum started. What I was met with, number one, was an accusation of obstructionism, by the First President Pro-Tempore, Ephraim Shalunov. Secondly, I was met with mockery, laughs, and sneers, from Sohum Kalia, the Internal Vice President, and the rest of the Senate […] during that meeting. Senators Shalunov, Carlson, and Cristiani all went to make a mockery of my request to give a summary and essentially make ableist comments, such as, ‘Oh, I said, blah blah blah.’ It is embarrassing and humiliating that a simple request to make a Senate meeting, that is supposed to represent all students, more accessible is met with ableist comments, accusations of obstructionism, laughs, and sneers.” JOYCE: Let’s talk about each of the new resolutions now. ZOHA: The first resolution, SR 6-101B, condemns Hamas. It was brought by the same four Senators who wrote the original resolution: Cristiani, Lebowski, Goren, and Shalunov. Student sponsors include the AS Jewish Commission and Students Supporting Israel – but again, not any Muslim or Arab student organizations. JOYCE: The resolution’s “whereas” clauses, which provide the reasoning behind a bill, says Hamas’ 1988 charter declares its purpose as, quote, “the murder of the Jewish people, and that the terrorist group will never pursue peace through any other means,” end quote. ZOHA: For reference, the Hamas Covenant of 1988 states, quote, “Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.” And, quote, “Our struggles against the Jews is very great and very serious,” end quote. JOYCE: Hamas’ most recent charter, from 2017, states that the group, quote, “does not wage a struggle against the Jews because they are Jewish but wages a struggle against the Zionists who occupy Palestine,” end quote. ZOHA: Back to the new AS Senate resolution, which says that, quote, “Some student groups have praised and justified the horrific actions of Hamas…holding rallies supporting the atrocities Hamas has committed under the false guise of liberation,” end quote. The Senators did not clarify which pro-Hamas student groups they were referring to. JOYCE: Therefore, among other provisions, the resolution condemns Hamas for the, quote, “undeniably barbaric” October 7th attacks, which were carried out “primarily because the victims were Jewish.” The resolution also mourns civilian deaths in both Israel and Gaza and, quote, “finds it self-evident that legitimate expressions of solidarity for the Palestinian people are distinct from endorsements of Hamas and terrorism,” end quote. ZOHA: The second resolution, SR 7-101A, condemns both antisemitism and Islamophobia. It was brought by Senators Shalunov, Cristiani, Lebowski, Alvin Wang, MingJun Zha, Diana Kero, and Eric Carlson. There are no non-senator student sponsors on this bill. According to Senator Carlson, student sponsors are generally rare, since people usually do not attend Senate meetings. More on that later. JOYCE: The resolution’s “whereas” clauses lists several instances of hate speech and violence across American college campuses. ZOHA: For example, as the Associated Press reports, a student at Cornell was charged with threatening to shoot and stab Jewish people. ABC News reports that at Stanford, an Arab Muslim student was injured in a hit-and-run, which is still being investigated as a possible hate crime. JOYCE: At UCSB, the resolution says in May, the Chabad, quote, “was defaced with antisemitic graffiti before their Mega Shabbat event,” end quote. Specifically, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” was spray painted on the road. ZOHA: Additionally, at the November 8th AS Senate Meeting, Arab and Muslim students reportedly had flyers on their cars calling Arabs, quote, “wild, lawless, and crazy,” end quote. One Jewish student said their life was threatened and their door set on fire, and that they were subject to physical assault. JOYCE: Therefore, SR 7-101A, quote, “strongly condemns the surge of Islamophobia and antisemitism,” recognizes that the war and conflict “may be categorized as ethnic or religious in nature,” and “encourages bold, controversial, and diverging discussions of all political issues, including the ongoing Israel-Hamas war,” end quote. ZOHA: The AS Senators then spoke on the two bills. JOYCE: Senator Coleton Cristiani said the bills respond to student concerns, and that the condemnation of Islamophobia was added after public input. ZOHA: Here’s Senator Shalunov. [Senator Ephraim Shalunov] “The first version of this resolution that was discussed last week – there was some pretty valid criticism of it. Namely that criticism was that it left it too vague as to who it condemned. There was this point about “Pro-Hamas student groups” that left people rightfully scared that they might be [relegated] something they were not.” “I want to reiterate that this resolution is not against anybody in this room I hope, since I should hope that nobody in this room supports Hamas.” JOYCE: Senator Eric Carlson’s speech was especially long and comprehensive. He discussed feeling disillusioned and a deep fear of making the wrong choice. Towards the end of the meeting, he would later'}]"

When last winter’s disastrous storms left no access out of the Valley, some residents tragically lost their lives after being unable to reach their regular dialysis treatment off the mountain. To ensure that this never happens again, BVCHD has acquired machines for emergency, in-patient dialysis. Thanks to the generous donation of $100,000 from Ann Petersen and Leslie Pam, in partnership with BVCHD Foundation, two new state-of-the-art Quanta Dialysis machines will be in operation at the hospital for acute, inpatient emergent needs. Whether snowstorms, road closures, wildfires or other natural events that keep patients from leaving the mountain, BVCHD can now take care of patients in need of dialysis. “Since this year might be a repeat of last year and we get snowed in, we need to address the most urgent need, which is dialysis, as our two fatalities were because the patients could not access dialysis in a timely manner,” said Ann Petersen, who delivered the check to BVCHD. Herbert Perez, 61, was one of the longtime Big Bear Valley residents that died after the storms cut of access to his thrice-weekly dialysis appointments. “The reason why I started it is because I don’t want any other family to go through what I’m going through,” said his wife, Brenda Perez. “I would like other people to get the help that they need, because I don’t want to see anybody else go through this, it’s a hard thing.” The program will be headed by Medical Director Prashanth V. Kumar, MD, a widely respected Nephrologist based out of the Victor Valley. “I am proud to be a participant in the synergy between a visionary CEO, philanthropy to bring critical dialysis services to the community of Big Bear,” Kumar said. “We are thrilled that BVCHD has selected the Quanta™ Dialysis System for its dialysis needs,” said Alejandro Galindo, Quanta CEO. “The release of our Trinal Kidney Therapy™ software offers acute settings like BVCHD the ability to perform all hemodialysis modalities – intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis (SLED), and bagless continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) – with a single, compact device. This versatility solution enables the treatment of patients across the acute care continuum, from intensive care to in-patient dialysis, simplifying the process for healthcare providers and potentially improving patient care through streamlined technology.” BVCHD is standing up several service lines to keep Big Bear Valley Residents from having to travel off the mountain for life-saving medical care including; telestroke, on-site cardiology, on-call surgery, extended Urgent Care hours, on-call orthopedics, and more. But the tragedies created by the storms set a clear priority for Hospital leadership to find a way to bring Dialysis to our residents in need. “This state-of-the-art advancement in service is not only lifesaving but continues our strategic trajectory and mission to enhance healthcare for our residents and bring services to the community, not the community to the services,” said Evan Rayner, BVHCD CEO. The new machines are used for emergency, in-patient dialysis only and are operational at BVCHD. “He would be so proud to have these in the hospital to help other people,” Brenda Lopez added.
