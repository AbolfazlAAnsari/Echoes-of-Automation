LEILA FADEL, HOST: Colorado's Supreme Court disqualified him based on a clause in the Constitution. It says a former official may not return to office after engaging in insurrection or rebellion. Trump gave a speech to supporters, who then stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The case turns on many questions, like whether that attack counts as insurrection and who gets to decide if the rule applies to Trump. INSKEEP: The case does have implications for other states, so NPR's Carrie Johnson is following it. Hi there, Carrie. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, so what is the law here? JOHNSON: The key law is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which was passed after the Civil War to try to keep Confederates out of government. This provision says anyone who swore an oath to the Constitution and went on to engage in insurrection is disqualified from public office unless two-thirds of Congress votes to grant that person amnesty. It's never been applied to a former president, and it's only been applied about eight times since the 1860s. I talked with Jason Murray, a lawyer who will argue the case today for the Colorado voters, and he says this part of the Constitution remains relevant. Here's more of what Murray had to say. JASON MURRAY: The reason why this case is unprecedented is because Donald Trump's behavior is unprecedented. No other American president has refused to peacefully hand over the reins of power after losing an election. INSKEEP: Which is true and does answer one concern, which is why is this amendment being cited now when it's so rarely - or this provision of it so rarely been cited in the past? What is former President Trump's response? JOHNSON: Donald Trump is making a bunch of arguments. First, he says the president is actually not an officer of the United States because he says presidents are elected and not appointed. And so he says that part of the 14th Amendment should not apply to him. Trump also says he did not engage in an insurrection on January 6. He's also making the case that barring him from the ballot will open the floodgates. Scott Gessler is one of Trump's lawyers. He says there's going to be a constant stream of litigation if the Supreme Court allows these doors to open. SCOTT GESSLER: And it's not going to stop. You're going to see attacks on President Biden. You're going to see attacks on Kamala Harris - Vice President Harris. You're going to see attacks on senators and representatives, other people, trying to prevent them from being on the ballot. JOHNSON: And if Scott Gessler sounds a little scratchy there, it's because I caught him at the airport where he traveled to defend Trump on another ballot disqualification issue in Illinois. INSKEEP: Because there are plenty of cases going on. I'm trying to think this through from the Supreme Court's point of view, though. Chief Justice John Roberts has tried, when possible, to make the court seem a little less political, to keep out of political controversies where possible, to give narrow rulings where possible. And now we have this gigantic question of whether a former president of the United States should be on the presidential ballot, possibly in multiple states. What are the court's options here? JOHNSON: This is a hard one. You know, the court is now at the center of a presidential election, just like it was in 2000 when it stopped the Florida recount and handed the White House to George W. Bush. But in this case, the justices have a few options. They could decide to disqualify Trump, just like the Colorado Supreme Court did. Depending on how they rule, it could have a cascading effect in other states at the primary and the general election level. They could decide this is a political question, Steve - one for Congress and voters to answer, not the courts. Or they could side with Trump and dozens of other Republicans in Congress and keep Trump on the ballot. It's kind of hard to predict what the justices might do here. INSKEEP: So when do they rule, however they may rule? JOHNSON: Well, the court's been moving pretty quickly. Experts want them to issue a definitive ruling soon, before many more voters go to the polls on Super Tuesday in early March. INSKEEP: NPR's Carrie Johnson, thanks so much. JOHNSON: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: The United States asserts that it gained a measure of justice for an attack that killed three U.S. soldiers. INSKEEP: A U.S. airstrike in Iraq killed a leader of a militia whose group the United States blamed for an attack on an American base. This is all part of a multinational conflict. Grab your maps. The Americans were killed at a base in Jordan. The militia leader was killed in Iraq. He was part of a group that's linked to Iran, which in turn has vowed to respond to the Israel-Hamas war. Numerous armed groups have opened fire throughout the region, and the latest incident led to a dayslong U.S. response. FADEL: NPR's Jane Arraf joins us now from Baghdad to talk about all this. Hi, Jane. JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Hi, Leila. FADEL: So what do we know about who was killed in this strike? ARRAF: Well, the militia Kataib Hezbollah has confirmed it was one of its commanders. He was called Abu Baqir Al-Saadi. And an Interior Ministry official says he was head of logistics for the Iran-backed group. The U.S., in confirming the strike, said Al-Saadi had been directly involved in attacks on U.S. forces. A bit of confusion still here because initial reports from the Interior Ministry said three people were killed, and it's still not clear whether that was the case and whether there were other militia figures. This was a targeted strike, Leila, using an adapted Hellfire missile with a nonexplosive warhead - the kind used by the U.S. for counterterrorism operations in crowded areas, which this, indeed, was. The vehicle burst into flames on impact of the airstrike. Everyone in the car was killed, but there were no other casualties reported. FADEL: So a targeted strike in Baghdad by the U.S. - pretty dramatic. What's the mood in the capital this morning? ARRAF: Yeah. Apprehension, really, and fear and waiting for what comes next. FADEL: Yeah. ARRAF: And there are really not a lot of good scenarios here. It's a workday here, so people, in fact, did go to work. Shops are opening. Seems relatively normal. But this afternoon is the funeral ceremony in Baghdad for the commander who was killed. Some of the Iran-backed groups have called for protesters to gather near the U.S. Embassy, and in the past, those gatherings have sometimes turned violent. And some members of the anti-U.S. resistance, that coalition that Kataib Hezbollah belong to, have called for new attacks against the United States. The Iraqi Hezbollah itself halted attacks in deference to the Iraqi government recently, but it could very well announce a resumption, and that would signal a new wave of attacks from both sides. FADEL: So it's possible that this escalates. I mean, let's talk about the wider repercussions, though, here. I mean, the U.S. and Iraq recently started talks on the future of American forces in that country. Does this killing impact those talks? ARRAF: I think it almost certainly does. An Iraqi military spokesman, Yehia Rasool (ph), said these latest attacks were increasing pressure on the Iraqi government to essentially expel U.S. forces. Now, this wouldn't be an overnight process. It would be the result of talks and negotiations, as the U.S. is still an essential security partner. But after withdrawing after its invasion of Iraq and the occupation, troops came back here in 2014 to fight ISIS... FADEL: Right. ARRAF: ...At the invitation of the Iraqi government. The U.S. views these recent attacks that it's launched as a response to being attacked by militias. But there's increasing anger in Parliament, in the streets, in the halls of government, even, at violations of Iraqi sovereignty. And just really quickly, 'cause this is a complicated but important part, these militias that are attacking and being attacked by the U.S. - they actually have brigades that are part of Iraqi government security forces. FADEL: NPR's Jane Arraf in Baghdad. Thank you, Jane. ARRAF: Thank you, Leila. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Pakistanis are headed to the polls today, and it's quite an endeavor. INSKEEP: Yeah. This is one of the most populous nations on Earth, so here are some of the numbers. Tens of millions of people will be eligible to vote at more than 90,000 polling stations, guarded by more than 700,000 police officers and soldiers, who are needed because dozens of people have been killed""}]"

Please enter a search term. by: Matthew Johnstone Posted: Feb 7, 2024 / 10:21 PM CST Updated: Feb 7, 2024 / 10:22 PM CST by: Matthew Johnstone Posted: Feb 7, 2024 / 10:21 PM CST Updated: Feb 7, 2024 / 10:22 PM CST TOPEKA (KSNT) – Reenlisting following a national tragedy, Army Sergeant Michael Cruse served however he could across the country and abroad during his 21 years of service. Cruse joined the service in his junior year of high school. He was motivated by an unusual source, his history class. “When you go through high school obviously you study a lot of history,” Cruse said. “A lot of our history unfortunately focuses on people that have been oppressed. Looking at that, like World War II with the holocaust and everything, and coming from a nontraditional family, a single parent family, I understood what oppression could look like. I wanted to be a part of relieving that, or serving to prevent that.” Inspired by his grandfather’s sacrifices in the service, Cruse joined the Military Police and served at Fort Riley. From there, he signed on with the Topeka Police Department, until tragedy struck the nation with the fall of the Twin Towers. “I sat there in a little bit of confusion, and dismay,” he said. “I felt a lot of emotions watching it. It was a tragic, tragic day. It was our generation’s Pearl Harbor in my opinion. At that moment, I went and reenlisted.” Following that reenlistment, Cruse served in various roles across the country and abroad. “The first assignment was Wolf Creek nuclear facility,” Cruse said, “we had to secure that obviously. From there I went to Fort Riley again except as an instructor for people going to Bosnia. I provided instruction on how to search people, vehicles, equipment and so forth. I went to Kosovo, this was all in support of the result of 9/11. I was a military Police liaison for the Kosovo police department.” If that wasn’t enough, Cruse worked along Civil Affairs in Kosovo, ran the AC-130 Airborne Communications Crew, and served as an Assistant Convoy Security Commander, moving supplies and route reconnaissance from Turkey down through Iraq. “I took a lot of pride in what I did,” Cruse said. “Getting to go through while I was in Iraq or Kosovo, and dealing with people that had experienced oppression and fear, getting to see the change. The change in their expressions and their behaviors. We made a positive impact.” Through his 21 years of service and countless military positions he served in, there’s one area Cruse feels doesn’t get the recognition that’s deserved. “The biggest overlooked things in service and sacrifice is the sacrifices that our spouses make,” he said. “I had been in Iraq over 16 months, a year in Kosovo, a lot of time gone from the family, which placed a lot on my wife. Being a caregiver, and also having to replace my role as the father. My wife sacrificed a lot, and anything that I have every accomplished would not have been possible without her.” At the end of his military service, Cruse followed in his grandfather’s footsteps even further, returning to law enforcement. He retired from the Topeka Police Department in May of 2023, after 25 years in the service, working across the violent crimes unit, community policing and crime scene investigations.
