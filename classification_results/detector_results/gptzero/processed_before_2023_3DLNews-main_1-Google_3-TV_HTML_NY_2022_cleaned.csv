Burmese civilian forces continue to fight against the rule of Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and his junta. While foreign governments are starting to take a stronger stance, including imposing sanctions on military personnel, Burmese nationals are calling for more support and using their voices to educate the international community about the ongoing fighting in their homeland. On Wednesday, Better Burma and One Light Global co-hosted a panel discussion between five Burmese nationals resisting the Myanmar military regime. Each of the panelists has appeared on the Insight Myanmar podcast. Topics discussed include crimes against humanity committed by the military throughout Myanmar’s history such as the 2017 Rohingya crisis, life during the coup, and visions for the future. The panelists are: Due to the length of the panel discussion and the many topics that were discussed, coverage of the panel will be separated into two stories. This article will cover discussions about Myanmar’s past and its impacts on the present, and part two will be released separately and dive more into the present and visions for the future. Zoe Wild, Panel Mediator of One Light Global: Could you explain what is happening in Myanmar for people who do not know? Linn Thant: There was an attempted coup on February 1, 2021. I use the word ‘attempted’ because the people of Myanmar do not accept military rule. The military still cannot rule the country. When the coup began, the people protested very peacefully but were brutally attacked. The military is responsible for protecting the people of Myanmar, but instead, they are killing, looting, and torturing them. That is why people think of the military as more of a terrorist group. That is why the feeling in Burma is this is our revolution. Our lives matter. We have the right to defend ourselves and live peacefully and securely. The people have decided to fight back. We have groups such as the People’s Defense Force fighting the military. We do not want war, brutality, or to fight with guns. We had to choose this way. Our teachers, lawyers, doctors, and nurses became freedom fighters. It is very sad for our community. The terrorist group pushed them to be fighters. The military has burnt thousands of houses across the country. We have reports and documentation that over 6,000 people have been killed since the start of the coup. We cannot learn who many victims are because the regime secretly kills them. Across the country, they have detained and arrested over 13,000 people, most of them activists, civilians, and those we call ‘Generation Z’. Last year on Christmas Eve, over 30 people, including infants and children, were killed in the Karenni State. Wild: Why do you think the international community does not respond the same way to other crises around the world? Linn Thant: I think some in the international community know about the situation in Burma but they did not want to take the responsibility to support the people of Myanmar in need. If they respect human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, they should support the people of Myanmar. The military and junta are very close to the Russians right now. People should know about these situations and be made aware of them. Why are they sleeping? I do not know. Bart: I think part of the reason could be that our leader Aung San Suu Kyi defended a genocide on TV, and things went downhill. *The genocide to which Bart is referring is known as the Rohingya Genocide. The Myanmar military persecuted the Rohingya, an ethnic and religious minority who were deprived of citizenship due to Myanmar’s 1982 Citizenship Law. According to the United States Agency for International Development, the military raped, tortured, and murdered thousands in their attempt to ethnically cleanse the Rohingya people. In 2017, 740,000 Rohingya – 400,000 of whom were children were forced out of the country. Instead of condemning the military and their crimes against the Rohingya, Aung San Suu Kyi denied that this was a case of ethnic cleansing and claimed that they would prosecute soldiers who committed war crimes but very little was done. Her pronouncement on this matter resulted in her losing much of the luster she had gotten as an international icon of democratic values and human rights. Thiri: We are a country with one of the largest civil wars. The fighting is between the Myanmar military and a bunch of ethnic minorities. After 2012, the most prevalent is the genocidal crime against the Rohingya and Muslim minorities in the Rakhine State (western Myanmar bordering Bangladesh). It is a very ugly and sad history that we have to carry on, which I am not proud of. One part of the state (the military) committed the crime, and the other (Aung San Suu Kyi) defended it for whatever reason. The general public was cut out from information, and many people in the country may not have been made aware of what happened. No matter what, the genocide occurred, and we have to acknowledge that. The same perpetrator is there. If we keep them in place, the violations will move from one group to another. I understand if people are hesitant about supporting Myanmar, but this is the same military. If we do not push them out, we won’t be able to get justice for the Rohingya or anyone else. We should be supported, not because we are the little people from the conflict setting. We deserve to live with dignity, including the Rohingya. Bart: To summarize what Thiri was saying, the first coup happened in the 60s, and since, the military has been in power. Who killed the students in the 1980s? Who killed the people in 1996? Who killed the monks in 2007? Who made the young people racist through religious propaganda? Who killed the Rohingya? Who took over the country in 2021? The military. With the Rohingya genocide, the military had a scapegoat in the National League of Democracy, who took the blame for everything. The military is a cancer, and for me, 2015 to 2020 was a pain medication. We were not fighting the cancer, we were just using painkillers for five years to ease the pain. The cancer returned in 2021, and we went back to actively fighting. The head of the military can change, but the cancer never changed. It is the same institution. Wild: Myanmar is not in the news here like Ukraine, Iran, or some other countries are every day, in the New York Times, in news outlets. It is one of the most striking aspects of the crisis that even the most compassionate and well-informed groups do not know what is happening. Ma Thida: The challenge is related to the right to information. We have gone through five decades of censorship, which has made us intellectually blind. Serious propaganda has also hit us really badly. Wording like the term Rohingya had been totally abolished because of the 1962 Printing Act (a law that required all news materials to be reviewed and approved by a government panel prior to publication). Due to the censorship, many of the younger generation and the general public never heard of this word. A lot of us were not exposed to some of the bigger pictures inside the country, and at the same time, we did not have enough information. The problem with the international community is they don’t have enough information about us and what is happening. In this era of the information pandemic, in terms of the right to information, it is not just the responsibility of the journalists but also the citizens of the globe. We need to use our rights and freedom to reach out to every single piece of information that we are supposed to know. Otherwise, our activism will be very specific and narrow. That is why I encourage everyone, even if your local media cannot talk about Burma, why don’t you actively look at what is going on in the war? Every day after February 1, 2021, there is a protest and resistance inside my country. Wild: I am curious if you can speak to the global connection of what is happening in Myanmar and how that relates to the larger movement around the world of people fighting against oppression. Ma Thida: The game changer was the 1962 Printing Act. After that, the military took over the power and invented the one-party socialist system. They created serious propaganda and a very poor education system that undermined literature, the arts, and linguistic rights. That is the key problem because many non-Burma'}]"

Police discovered the remains of four infants in a South Boston apartment earlier this month, according to a press release issued Monday. Police say they responded to a call to investigate the apartment on Nov 17. When arriving on the scene around 2:15 p.m. ET, they discovered first “what appeared to be a human fetus or an infant.” Additional human remains were discovered the next day, police say. An ongoing autopsy has so far revealed the remains of two male infants and two female infants. A Suffolk County District Attorney spokesman told local news outlets that the remains were discovered inside a freezer. The district attorney’s office did not immediately return NPR’s request for confirmation. Police have yet to share any information about the identity of the infants, name potential suspects or say whether they were considering pressing charges.

Early on a Monday morning, a group of young obstetrics and gynecology residents gathered for a daily meeting. The young doctors, dressed in blue scrubs and white coats, sat in the auditorium of Indiana’s largest teaching hospital. The meeting was a chance to share updates and make announcements. But they also had to address the elephant in the room. “Any more abortion care questions?” Dr. Nicole Scott, the residency program director, asked the trainees. One of the residents spoke after a few harsh moments of silence: “How’s Dr. Bernard doing?” “Bernard is actually in really good spirits. I mean, relatively,” Scott answered. “She has 24/7 security, has her own lawyer.” They’re referring to Dr. Caitlin Bernard, an Indiana abortion provider and one of the physicians who trains residents at this university hospital. Bernard was recently caught in a political whirlwind after she spoke to a reporter about an abortion she provided to a 10-year-old rape victim who crossed the state line from Ohio. The doctor was the target of attacks from pundits and political leaders on national television, including Indiana’s attorney general. The vitriol hit home for this group of residents. Bernard has been a mentor for most of them for years. Many of these young doctors were certain they wanted to practice in Indiana after training. Lately, some have felt more ambivalent. “Watching what [Dr. Bernard] went through was scary,” said Dr. Beatrice Soderholm, a fourth year OB-GYN resident and one of Bernard’s mentees. “I think that was part of the point for those who were putting her through that. [It] was to scare other people out of doing the work that she does.” Last week, Republican Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb signed a near-total abortion ban into law, making Indiana the first state to pass new legislation restricting access to abortion since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June. Before the lawmakers voted, thousands of Indiana providers voiced concerns that outcomes would likely get worse for their patients. It’s unclear what this will mean for providers too. And that’s worrying medical residents – the early career doctors who spend four years training to become OB-GYNs. These days, Scott, the residency program director, has found that the scope of her job has expanded beyond clinical and academic responsibilities. Her meetings with residents include political updates, and she tells them there are mental health services available if they need them. “I mean, our residents are devastated,” Scott said, holding back tears. “They signed up to provide comprehensive health care to women. And they are being told that they can’t do that.” She expects this will “deeply impact” how Indiana hospitals recruit and retain medical professionals. Indiana, like many Republican-led states, has a shortage of providers. A 2018 report from the March of Dimes found 27% of Indiana counties are considered maternal care deserts, with no or limited access to maternity care. The state has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country. Scott said new laws restricting abortion will only make these statistics worse. Dr. Wendy Tian, a third year resident, said lately she is scared and worried about her safety. Tian grew up and went to school in Chicago and chose to come to Indiana for residency because the program has a strong family planning focus. She was also open to practicing in Indiana when she completes her training. But that’s changed. “I always thought I wanted to do family planning. I’m now thinking about doing something else,” she said. “I know I still want to incorporate it. But I, for sure, don’t know if I would be able to stay in Indiana postgraduation with what’s going on.” Still, she feels “guilty for giving up” on some of the most vulnerable patients in Indiana. Even before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Tian said the medical climate in Indiana could be hostile and frustrating. Indiana, like other states with abortion restrictions, allows nearly all health care providers to opt out of providing care for abortion patients. “We encounter other people who we work with on a daily basis who are opposed to what we do,” Tian said. Tian said sometimes she and her colleagues have to cancel scheduled procedures because the nursing staff on-call are not comfortable helping a patient who is having an abortion. “Frequently, we have to call anesthesia ahead of time, because there’s only certain providers that are willing to provide anesthesia [for abortion patients],” Tian said. Still, the OB-GYN program in Indiana has been able to provide residents with comprehensive training, which includes abortion care and family planning. This is important for more than for abortion cases. “Miscarriages are managed the exact same way as first-trimester termination procedures,” Scott said. “But what termination procedures allow you to do is that kind of repetition and that understanding of the female anatomy, and how to manage complications that may happen with miscarriages.” And that concerns Scott because taking away abortion dramatically reduces the hands-on experience OB-GYN residents can get in her hospital. Scott’s program is exploring ways to make up for that. They could send residents out of state to learn in places without abortion restrictions. But Scott said this would be a logistical nightmare. “This is not as simple as just showing up to an office and saying, ‘Can I observe?’ This includes getting a medical license for out-of-state trainees. This includes funding for travel and lodging,” Scott said. “It adds a lot to what we already do to educate future OB-GYNs.” Nearly half of all OB-GYN residents in the U.S. are in states where abortion is banned or likely to be banned. This means that there will be an influx of residents looking to go out of state to make up for lost training opportunities. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the body that accredits residency programs, proposed modifications to the graduation requirements for OB-GYN residents to account for this changing landscape. For some residents, like first-year Veronica Santana, these political hurdles are actually a welcome challenge. Santana is Latina, grew up in Seattle, and has been involved in community organizing since she was a teenager. Part of why she chose obstetrics and gynecology was because of how the field of medicine intersects with social justice. “It’s political. It always has been and it continues to be. And obviously, especially now,” she said. After Roe was overturned, Santana took to the streets of Indianapolis to participate in abortion rights rallies. So did many of her co-residents and mentors. Most of them, including the program director, have asked not to name the school of medicine or hospital system they work for because they fear backlash. Some said their employer remains timid in supporting the staff when it comes to the abortion debate in Indiana. In a way, Indiana could be the perfect battleground to quench Santana’s zest for advocacy and social activism. But lately, she said she is “very unsure” if staying in to practice after residency makes sense as a physician who wants to provide the entire scope of health services. Soderholm, a fourth year medical resident, said it’s a lot to think about. Soderholm will complete her training in a few months and start to practice soon. She grew up in Minnesota, but over the past few years has felt a strong connection to patients at the county hospital in Indianapolis. She was so certain she wanted to practice in Indiana. But lately, her family in Minnesota – where abortion remains largely protected – questioned why she would stay to practice in a hostile medical climate like Indiana’s. “There’s been a lot of hesitation. But the women [and] the childbearing people that we’ve taken care of, especially at our county hospital, [make it] really hard to leave. Sorry,” she said, starting to cry. It’s for those patients that Soderholm decided she’ll likely stay. The same can’t be said for many other future doctors.

In this video we look at mental health crisis workers who balance taking care of others and themselves. In this video, we present mental illness from the caregiver\'s point of view. Lisa Maria Cruz has schizoaffective disorder, bi-polar schizophrenia with a mood disorder. WBFO’s Mark Wozniak shares his story of depression, how he has dealt with it, and what can be learned. WBFO Dominique Thomas is due in court Wednesday on charges he ran at Buffalo Police with a knife at his Hertel Avenue address. His appearance may be delayed, however, as Thomas recovers from gunshot wounds at Erie County Medical Center under the care of mental health doctors. WBFO After yet more snow arriving late last week, many of us are feeling the winter blues. But for some, it’s much more than that. They began feeling a depression setting in by early fall, and will stay with them until spring. It’s a condition known as Seasonal Affective Disorder. WBFO There\'s a well-kept secret among women that finally may be getting the exposure it deserves. WBFO Western New Yorkers dealing with things like suicidal thoughts or addiction can now text Crisis Services in addition to calling their 24/7 hotline. The agency has launched a text and chat hotline, which runs from 6 p.m.-11 p.m. Monday-Friday WBFO New York State plans to open 24-hour mental health urgent care facilities. Spectrum Health, who currently operates as Erie County’s only ""Urgent Mental Health and Addiction Care Clinic,"" has seen the need for services rise since opening. Mental Health professionals have felt the physical and emotional effects of the demanding job long before the pandemic. Now, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, mental health workforce professionals are struggling with their own mental, physical and emotional well-being. How can these professionals avoid the emotional and physical burnout while caring for others?WBFO Managing Editor, Brigid Jaipaul-Valenza, discusses mental healthcare professional well-being and burnout with Dr. Catherine Cook-Cottone, Psychologist, Professor at University at Buffalo and Marijke Kemble, Life Coach, Career Mentor & Mindfulness Teacher. Their conversation explored driving factors behind mental health professional burnout, how that burnout affects providers, and what things they should be doing to take care of their own mental health. In partnership with the International Institute of Buffalo, BTPM presents Grasping the Dream: Mental Health Challenges for New Americans, a virtual community conversation. Refugees, immigrants, and asylum-seekers experience a number of stressors and trauma from war, political violence, armed conflict, and various related threats. These populations often experience high amounts of stress and major life adjustments that can cause depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Many new Americans will not receive the mental health care they need due to barriers in services and cultural stigma.Host Lynne Bader explored topics including refugee-related trauma and mental health issues, resettlement challenges and access to proper care, and culturally sensitive resources for service providers and the community. While the pandemic has not caused abuse, it has exacerbated abusive situations. Measures to keep the community safe, including shut downs and stay-at-home orders, have worsened vulnerabilities of individuals and families in violent and abusive situations. In partnership with the Family Justice Center, Buffalo Toronto Public Media hosted a virtual community conversation. Discussion topics included ways in which the pandemic and related economic and social factors have heightened situations of relationship abuse as it relates to mental health, as well as exploring regional and national resources available. Growing evidence shows that intimate partner violence has increased during the pandemic. It is important to note that intimate partner violence does not only impact women in heterosexual relationships. Intimate partner violence occurs in same-sex couples at rates equal to or higher than the rates in opposite sex partners. Communities of color are affected more severely as well, with systemic inequities often meaning lower income and less access to necessary services. As part of WBFO’s Mental Health Initiative, Buffalo Toronto Public Media presents a three-part virtual series exploring the stressors and available resources for students, teachers, and faculty returning to in-person classrooms in the fall. This first discussion focused on elementary and middle school students. Academic transitions present a number of challenges for students, teachers, and parents and these pressures are heightened by new routines under the pandemic. Increased isolation has been difficult for many families, especially children. Effects of the pandemic can be associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression.This virtual discussion series explores topics related to the reintegration of students and faculty into in-person learning. Topics include mental health and behavioral supports in schools, resources for parents, caregivers and families, and support and training for faculty and staff.
