April 28, 2021 By WECT By Ann McAdams | April 28, 2021 at 11:04 AM EDT – Updated April 28 at 11:58 AM WILMINGTON, N.C. (WECT) – They’d spent their entire FBI careers investigating horrible crimes, but it was still the last thing they’d expected: finding one of their own co-workers, murdered. In the summer of 1999, agents assigned to the Wilmington FBI office found themselves in that very situation. Despite all their experience, the shock of finding the body of FBI secretary Melissa Ann Mooney after going to her home for a well check made one agent on the scene vomit. WECT has now obtained the FBI investigative file into Mooney’s murder. Just 28 years old at the time of her death, she had been set to move into a brand new house on August 6, 1999, and had recruited FBI agents to help her. But on the morning of the move, the ever-punctual Mooney was a no-show. After she didn’t answer her phone, agents then drove to her new home in a Castle Hayne subdivision. Her car was in the driveway, and there was a large boot print on the front door that appeared to have been kicked in. An agent went into the home, and found the worst-case-scenario. Mooney’s nude and lifeless body, lying face up on the bedroom floor. She had been strangled. In no time, a massive investigation was underway. The FBI agents were too close to the victim to take the lead, and called in the New Hanover County Sheriff’s Office (NHCSO) to begin processing the crime scene. But the FBI went into overdrive to assist. You’d expect a thorough job by the FBI, but even by their exacting standards, this was a colossal effort. “She was part of the FBI family, and the FBI family wasn’t going to quit on this case until they figured out who did it and why they did it,” retired Agent Larry Bonney said. He was Mooney’s boss at the time of her death, and treated the single mother like his own daughter. Investigators set up a hotline at the NHCSO to field tips, securing six dedicated phone lines for anyone who might be willing to call in a lead on Mooney’s murder. They compiled a list of everyone who’d recently been released from nearby prisons to see if any could be likely suspects. And they went through Mooney’s address book, and tracked down dozens and dozens of her friends, love-interests and former FBI co-workers, who now lived all over the country. Field agents from San Francisco to Dallas to Philadelphia assisted in the effort to interview her contacts, even though many of those contacts hadn’t talked to Mooney in years. By nearly all accounts, Mooney was kind, quiet, reliable, and well-liked. But her personal life had been rocky. Melissa Mooney (Source: WECT/Dateline NBC) “She was having some bad experiences at home… She’d come in with a bruise and I’d ask her what happened and she said, ‘I fell down.’ And I finally said, ‘Come in here and sit down. What the heck is going on?’ And so she told me that this guy was a drunk and occasionally would slap her around a bit, and I said, ‘Kick him out,’” Bonney recalled. Mooney followed that advice, and separated from her husband, Roger Mooney. They had just finalized their divorce at the time of her death and had been in a contentious battle over child support for their four-year-old daughter, Sammy. It had gotten so bad that authorities say Roger, a Marine, had joked to colleagues about putting Melissa’s picture over the target at the shooting range to improve his accuracy. Melissa confided in friends that if she ever showed up dead, they should assume Roger did it. So when Mooney did, in fact, show up dead in an apparent crime of passion, many of those close to her naturally blamed Roger. Detectives thoroughly investigated him, but Roger remained steadfast that he was innocent. And while Roger seemed to have the motive to kill her, logistically, authorities thought it might have been a stretch for him to pull it off. Roger was watching Sammy the night Melissa died at his home near Camp Lejeune, a full 70 miles from Mooney’s new house in New Hanover County. Investigators believed she had died around 11:45 pm. For Roger to have done it, he’d had to have driven 140 miles round trip, either taking his young daughter with him, or leaving her for hours, then still make it back in time to get Sammy to her babysitter and himself to work by 5:30 the next morning. Despite many people’s gut instinct that Roger was guilty, the Wilmington FBI office director Larry Bonney, who had a background in profiling and abnormal psychology, suspected otherwise. “He said, ‘You know, it should be Roger, but it isn’t,’” District Attorney Ben David recalled of Bonney’s theory. “He said, ‘Actually, this man has a motive not to kill her. Because now he can’t go oversees and serve his country like he’s trained his whole life to do, because he’s now a single dad.’” Looking for alternative suspects, investigators started digging into Mooney’s complicated love life. She’d started dating again after getting separated from her husband, and some of those relationships had gotten serious. Agents tracked down some of her boyfriends, got fingerprints, hair and blood samples. But the men had solid alibis at the time of Mooney’s death, or simply didn’t seem to have the motive to kill her. After two years of painstaking work with no arrests, investigators had to admit the case had gone cold. “We just had to say, ‘let’s start over.’ You have to constantly test your assumptions with this job. You can’t always go off of your gut. You have to look at the evidence, sometimes from ten different ways,” David said of the decision to start the investigation from scratch. They brought in new detectives, advertised a whopping $80,000 reward for information hoping to generate new leads in the case, and went back to the beginning, canvassing the neighborhood for anyone who may have seen or heard anything the night Mooney died. This time, someone stood out. Tyrone Delgado, who lived down the street from Mooney, wasn’t as cooperative with investigators as he had been the first time they talked to him the day she died. In 1999, he’d told agents he hadn’t seen or heard anything unusual the night of Mooney’s death. Two years later, the former member of the Navy didn’t want to talk to investigators at all, and acted squirrely enough that he caught agents’ attention. Tyrone Delgado (Source: WECT/Dateline NBC) Agents started digging into Delgado’s past, and made some startling discoveries. “Mr. Delgado had never been convicted of anything more than misdemeanors.

Delgado had been arrested for breaking into a woman’s home in Leesville, Louisiana in 1994, and sexually assaulting her. She was pregnant at the time, home with her four young children when she says Delgado broke in and attacked her. The pictures of her dramatic bruising taken at the hospital after that assault are chilling. “When the FBI went and looked at that file, they thought they were looking at the ghost of Melissa Mooney,” David said of the disturbing similarities to Mooney’s injuries. Shortly after the 1994 attack, an affidavit in the FBI file says that Bessie Huff, Delgado’s mother, came and warned him to run in the middle of the night. At the time, authorities say she was an elected official in Leesville. “Bessie Huff told them they had to leave immediately,” the affidavit reads, relying on testimony from Delgado’s girlfriend at the time. “She and… Delgado fled the State of Louisiana…and were sent money by Western Union by his family after being told to flee the area before police arrested Delgado.” When Delgado was later arrested on a fugitive warrant, “the case was not prosecuted when the victim signed an agreement and was paid monies for restitution and medical expenses for sexual battery and aggravated burglary. The agreement was signed by the subject’s mother, Bessie Huff.” Authorities say Delgado’s mother intervened with the District Attorney in Vernon Parrish and asked for a plea deal. Delgado’s mother agreed to pay $2,000 to the victim, and Delgado agreed to leave town. The victim accepted the payment, and Delgado moved to Wilmington. The Leesville woman was not Delgado’s only accuser. Astonishingly, when agents researched all the places Delgado had moved during his time with the military, they found more than a dozen other women who claimed he’d brutalized them. A woman in Washington state came forward as early as 1991. Another former girlfriend got a restraining order against him in 1992. And a former wife, Gloria Fernandez Delgado,'}]"

(WECT) - The words on the wall of the Columbus County Sheriff’s Office are written in large black font and read: “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” The Bible verse is commonly quoted on everyday items, like coffee mugs and bumper stickers, but the writing inside the public law enforcement agency has drawn criticism from First Amendment activists. The separation of church and state is an ideal the United States of America was founded on. In fact, it was an idea so important to the founding fathers, they enshrined this idea in the U.S. Constitution. “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” Those are the first 16 words of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, it’s known as the Establishment Clause. That’s why the Freedom from Religion Foundation (FFRF) is asking Sheriff Jody Greene to have the words removed from the wall calling them a direct violation of the First Amendment. Greene was unable to be reached for an interview; however, a Columbus County spokeswoman said, “Sheriff is booked solid for this week and doesn’t have time for an interview. He advised that the bible verse on the wall will not be coming down.” Chris Line, a staff attorney for the FFRF responded to the sheriff’s response with disappointment. “Obviously, that is a very disappointing response. Right on the front page of the Sheriff’s Office’s website, it says, ‘We are dedicated to protecting the innocent and safeguarding lives and property, while always respecting the constitutional rights of others,’” staff attorney for FFRF Chris Line said. “It is a shame that the Sheriff’s Office isn’t willing to live up to that and instead they are choosing to violate their citizens’ constitutional rights by brazenly endorsing Christianity. The Sheriff’s Office serves all citizens regardless of belief or nonbelief, and this display alienates all of Columbus County’s non-Christian residents,” he continued. As far as possible repercussions for Greene’s office? Line said it is a very real possibility that a lawsuit could be filed. “We are looking at all of our options at this time. We will talk with our local complainant and evaluate whether a lawsuit is the best course of action to resolve this constitutional violation, but we are also hopeful that other members of the Columbus County community will come forward, whether it be to speak out about this issue or to join in any potential litigation,” Line said. There is strong precedence for the group’s argument as the Supreme Court has ruled on matters like this in the past. “The First Amendment’s Establishment Clause prohibits the government from making any law ‘respecting an establishment of religion.’ This clause not only forbids the government from establishing an official religion, but also prohibits government actions that unduly favor one religion over another. It also prohibits the government from unduly preferring religion over non-religion, or non-religion over religion,” according to Cornell’s Legal Information Institute. The FFRF argues by posting such an overtly Christian message on the walls of the sheriff’s office, it shows a clear preference for one group of people. It’s not the first time the FFRF has taken issue with the actions of the Columbus County Sheriff’s Office. “Last Christmas, the sheriff’s office posted Merry Christmas to all and happy birthday to our Lord and Savior. Of course, we don’t think there’s anything wrong with saying Merry Christmas, of course, but making it a religious thing, really focusing on the religious aspect is what was concerning, and just concerned us the sheriff’s office was promoting Christianity through official communication channels, like its Facebook page, and kind of just coming off like it, you know, viewed one, religion as better than others,” Line said. After writing the sheriff’s office when that post was brought to their attention, the FFRF did not receive a response. On Dec. 14, the FFRF once again sent a letter to the sheriff’s office, and Line said his hope is that Greene would simply understand that he is violating the constitution and take the verse off the wall. “The Columbus County Sheriff’s Office is meant to serve all citizens regardless of belief or nonbelief. Over one-third [of] Americans are non-Christians, and this includes the more than one in four Americans who now identify as religiously unaffiliated. The message that is up in the sheriff’s building alienates this huge portion of the American population,” according to FFRF. WECT reached out to Columbus County Attorney Amanda Prince who refused to comment on the legality of the verse on the wall but directed a reporter to the sheriff’s office. “I cannot give you a legal opinion regarding this matter,” she said. UPDATE: Greene responded to the controversy in a Columbus County Sheriff’s Office Facebook post Tuesday. FROM: Sheriff Jody Greene Good afternoon, Columbus County citizens. I would like to address the recent news article WECT TV6 ran on me concerning a Bible verse that is posted on the wall at the Sheriff’s Office. The verse is “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. Philippians 4:13″ First, the Bible verse was placed on the wall after I took office. It was paid for with private funds, not with county funding. The verse is one of my favorite Bible verses, and it seemed fitting for all the adversity I have had to endure. It is very motivational to me and my staff. Here at the Sheriff’s Office, we work hard in everything that we do. Before we execute a search warrant, or any service that puts our people in immediate harms way, we ALWAYS go to the Lord with a group prayer. ALWAYS! I was raised in church. I have been in law enforcement for over thirty years. My training taught me to value God, family, and my country. Going back to the Bible verse, I have taken many pictures with that Bible verse in the backdrop with not a single issue, but now that we are going into an election year, it is an issue. How absurd! It seems to me we have a few sheep in wolves clothing. That’s all. This is a political ploy. Some want a person that they can control. Companies spend thousands of dollars on motivational classes, to come up with motivational slogans. My motivation comes from the greatest motivational speaker of all times, Jesus Christ. Currently, in Columbus County, we are at 180 overdoses. Drugs and violence are killing our youth. We need more Jesus and less politics. I would like to thank the folks for all the phone calls and messages of support. Five of our County Commissioners and our House of Representative Brendon Jones have also called with their support. I am not scared of much, but I am afraid of burning in Hell. The image shown below from The Freedom from Religion Foundation, mocks Christians’ fear of burning in Hell. According to their Facebook page, they have a contest for the Unabashed Atheist/Nonbeliever of the week. The virtual billboard shown below has the winner’s photo in a silhouette of the devil and flames. Just look at where our society is headed. It is time, past time, to stand up. So let me be clear, I will not waiver on my stance and Christian beliefs. Merry Christmas and God bless you ALL!!
