His television deal alone is worth a reported $100 million, plus he has restaurants, products and more. Fieri also has two sons. So, do they automatically get the dough? Not so fast, according to the Mayor of Flavortown. “I’ve told them the same thing my dad told me. My dad says, ‘When I die, you can expect that I’m going to die broke, and you’re going to be paying for the funeral,'” he explained to Fox News. “And I told my boys, ‘None of this that I’ve been building are you going to get unless you come and take it from me.’” And taking over for Fieri requires an education. The restaurateur says he learned the best path for rich parents who want to help guide their children from a very famous professional athlete: Los Angeles Lakers great Shaquille O’Neal. “Shaq said it best. Shaq said ‘If you want this cheese, you got to get to two degrees.’ Well, my two degrees mean, you know, postgraduate. So, they’re on their way,” Fieri said. His oldest son, Hunter, is in the MBA program at the University of Miami. Fieri’s youngest son, Ryder, is currently a senior in high school. As he’s getting prepared for college, he had a conversation with his dad on this topic. “He’s like, ‘Dad, this is so unfair. I haven’t even gone to college yet, and you’re already pushing that I’ve got to get an MBA? Can I just get through college?’” Beyond Fieri’s sons, his nephew Jules is in the law program at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles while working in the music industry. “If you’re going to be a big-time entertainment agent, you’re going to need that law background,” he told the outlet. The degree talk comes a month after Fieri signed a $100 million multiyear deal with the Food Network, sources told Variety. Under the agreement, the TV star will continue to produce “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,” “Guy’s Grocery Games” and “Tournament of Champions.” Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

(WTNH) — A civil rights leader and Yale professor was escorted by police out of a North Carolina movie theater after he insisted on using his own chair for medical reasons, prompting an apology from the nation’s largest movie theater chain. The incident occurred Tuesday in Greenville during a showing of “The Color Purple.” The Rev. William Barber II said he needs the chair because he has ankylosing spondylitis, a disabling bone disease. Barber, 60, leads a nonprofit called Repairers of the Breach, which focuses on issues including voter suppression and poverty. He also co-chairs the national Poor People’s Campaign, which is modeled after an initiative launched in 1968 by the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. During an hourlong news conference on Friday, Barber spoke in support of people with disabilities and the need for businesses to provide the accommodations required under the Americans with Disabilities Act. “I know that if I cannot sit in my chair in a theater in Greenville, North Carolina …. that there are thousands of other people who will be excluded from public spaces in this nation,” Barber said. Barber said managers at the AMC theater asked an armed security guard and local police officers to remove him after he stood firm on using the chair. Barber said he agreed to be escorted out after officers said they’d have to close down the theater and arrest him. Barber said he left his 90-year-old mother behind with an assistant to watch the film. Video of the incident shows Barber talking to an officer before walking out of the theater. “This is not about me personally,” he said. “Though it happened to me personally, this is about what systemic changes, policy changes (and) training needs to be done to ensure this happens to no one.” Greenville police said in a statement that a caller from the theater said a customer was arguing with employees and the theater wanted him removed.

AMC apologized in a written statement, saying it welcomes and works hard to accommodate guests with disabilities, WRAL reported. “We are also reviewing our policies with our theater teams to help ensure situations like this do not occur again,” the statement said.

A trio of respiratory illnesses are spreading widely, sickening families around the country with the flu, RSV and COVID. Tracking by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a substantial jump in people going to the doctor reporting symptoms of respiratory illnesses. There was also a 13% increase in people testing positive for influenza in a single week. The CDC estimates that so far this season, there have been 5.3 million people sickened, 54,000 people hospitalized, and 3,200 deaths from the flu – and those numbers are still rising. Connecticut is faring better than most. By the end of last week, on Dec. 16, Connecticut had a “low” level of flu activity as nine states had reached the “very high” flu activity category, the CDC’s highest level. One month ago, only two states were classified as “very high.” In the latest data released Friday, Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee were in that category. New York City, which reports health data separately from the rest of the state, was also “very high.” Another 14 states and Washington, D.C., weren’t far behind, still categorized as “high” illness activity. See how bad things have gotten in Connecticut over the last month using the maps below. Sliding the cursor back and forth compares the situation on Nov. 18 (left) with the most recent data from Dec. 16. The darker the shade of red, the higher the level of respiratory illness. Two states (Louisiana and South Carolina) are shown in purple, the very top tier. The CDC determines each state’s level of flu activity by comparing the current data from health care providers to what’s normal for that area outside of flu season. The data is based on the number of people reporting to a health care facility with flu symptoms – fever, plus a cough or sore throat. It is not based on lab-confirmed influenza cases. That means it could be including cases that turn out to be other respiratory illnesses, like COVID or RSV, but it also could be missing cases where people are staying home and fighting the sickness on their own. The three major viral illnesses listed above – COVID, RSV and influenza – have lots of overlapping symptoms, which can make it hard to know what you have without a test.
