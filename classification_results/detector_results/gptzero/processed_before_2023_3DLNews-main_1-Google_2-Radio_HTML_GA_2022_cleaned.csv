to hear one of those stories that make you go, “Wait. WHAT???” Terrell and Brandy Scott are married with five kids. They live in McDonough, Georgia and pastor a church. They run a ministry that serves families, children, and individuals in need, which is about as far away as you can get from where the story starts. When in the depths of drug use and gang activity, Terrell’s gang members held two women at gunpoint. One of those women was Brandy, who is now his wife!

It was out of that podcast (Episode 14) that birthed the idea of us renewing our vows. With the help of… View Full Post Laura Whitaker is the Executive Director of Extra Special People (ESP). ESP helps people see the abilities in people with disabilities. My first interaction with ESP was in Athens a few years ago with Java Joy, their coffee service program. Java Joy is completely run by people with disabilities and special needs. They call themselves JOYristas! Every cup of coffee is served with joy AND with a hug! In our conversation, Laura tells us about ESP and the programs that help assist, encourage and EMPLOY these wonderful friends. And oh my goodness…wait till you hear about the “White Apron” Ceremony!

But here what you may not know… Chris is… View Full Post Happy Easter, y’all! On this episode of OFF-AIR, I sat down with three of my favorites…Bill, Lindsay & Haley. We’ve been doing an online bible study together led by Paige Brown called “Bible History Overview.” That title sounds dry, but we were riveted! She connected to Old and New Testaments together for us and changed our perspective so much that we started a text thread with a few others called “5 Broads + Bill” to talk about each week’s lesson. So, that’s the starting place for our conversation. We ask two questions: “Why Jesus?” and “Why Jesus for us?” In today’s culture, Jesus often shows up as our pal who rubber stamps our feelings, and our “truth” who affirms everything we feel. While that’s a very sentimental way to view the Lord, it’s not biblical. As we celebrate Easter this weekend, we share our love for the Jesus of Scripture, the Divine Son of God and Savior of the world! View Full Post Repp & Summer Gordon experienced every parent's worst nightmare. They lost their sweet five year old son, Sawyer, in a horrific accident when he pedaled his bike onto a busy road. In this vulnerable conversation, Summer shares their journey through unspeakable grief and inexplicable forgiveness, held together by an unwavering faith. Of all the episodes of OFF-AIR with Carmen, THIS one will inspire you the most, especially if you have experienced personal loss. Repp and Summer’s belief in the goodness of God, despite this tragedy, will help you realize when all seems lost, HOPE REMAINS. View Full Post My guests this week are sisters Taylor and Madison from the band, Cain. I met Taylor and Madison along with their brother Logan about a year ago. It’s been fun to watch their debut single, Rise Up, shoot to #1 on the charts and stay there for several weeks! We'll talk about the dynamics between siblings being in a band together, what they all learned in their first year of marriage, and what it was like for us all (me included!) to grow up in Alabama! View Full Post My guest today is Temple Stewart. Temple is married to Ross, and they recently adopted sweet Ellie! They are also pregnant and expecting baby number two next month. Temple and I go to church together and have walked similar roads in trying to figure out our health through Functional Medicine. Temple is a WEALTH of knowledge in the Ketogenic world, and she is a “must-follow” on Instagram. She has helped many, many folks find long term success for their health goals. You'll also hear Temple talk about adoption and faith. I can’t wait for y’all to meet Temple! View Full Post Today you’ll meet Sarah Faulkner. I randomly met Sarah at a Christmas Market a couple of years ago. Like so many of us, Sarah thought her “story” would be one thing. But after surviving not one – but TWO – brain aneurysms, Sarah realized God’s story for her life had some unexpected chapters. Sarah’s faith inspires me, and I know it will inspire you too! View Full Post Like so many people, I’ve had a life-long struggle with weight. I’ve tried everything under the sun. You name it, I’ve done it. That all changed in 2019 when I was introduced to FASTer Way to Fat Loss. It was through this program that Amanda Tress introduced me to Alex, who practices Functional Medicine. In February of 2020, I had my first appointment with Alex, and I can confidently say that I have FINALLY found the answers I spent decades looking for. In today’s episode, I talk with Alex and Amanda about Functional Medicine (What is it?), Intermittent Fasting, Carb Cycling, and more.

insanely different circumstances.” Since each person is unique in personality, experiences and situations, their responses vary as well. Living in the country offered Luke opportunities to go for walks and play with his kids, unlike others who were living in a small flat in New York City. Luke listened to a sermon on the immense compassion of Jesus, whether He was healing a leper or feeding a crowd. Thinking about this, he was compelled to wonder what it means in our day and age to act like Jesus, since that’s what we are called to do as His followers. He wondered what it meant to have compassion for people and empathize with them. The Challenge “If you open up Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, we’re killing our own out there. There’s not a whole lot of compassion,” Luke comments. It breaks the Father’s heart to see, in some cases, that it’s inside the church. “The church is obviously made up of sick people. So that’s what we get.” Luke grieved over the divisiveness and what people were saying to one another, like, “It’s idiotic that you would say X or Y,” just because you disagree. The Solution Luke explains the idea for the song, Relate. “You don’t have to walk through the same thing. I know what pain feels like, so I mourn with you. I grieve with you because it looks like you’ve gone through something really, really difficult.” In this way, you can relate to someone who you can see is struggling. You can let him know you’re with him. Luke talks about “leaning in,” which is a posture that says you’re listening. We are all humans even behind faceless social media comments. At this point, Luke emphasizes that it’s hard to cast a stone, if you’re honestly saying you see the hurt. It goes the other way too. If somebody is writing an angry post and it’s directed at you, you can actually tell them you’ve been in that place of hurt, and this must be coming from there. You have compassion and grace for them. You don’t want to revert to, “I’ll SHOW THEM in ninety words.” Luke warns that those are the times when you may not be clearly thinking through what you’re typing. It’s important to recognize that the person who made you feel angry is a real person. God loves them too. Luke sees that his job is to, “Prick the hearts of people because a song and melody make the medicine go down a little bit better.” No, a song will not solve the problem, but Luke hopes people will hear it and, by the grace of God, see each other’s hearts. He’s hoping they’ll step back, calm the anger a bit and lean in to listen. Maybe you can relate some to what another person is going through even though you haven’t walked their journey. I don’t know what it’s like to be you. You don’t know what it’s like to be me. What if we’re all the same in different kinds of ways? Can you, can you relate? We both know what it’s like to bе hurt. We both know what it’s like to feel pain. But I think it’s safe to say wе’re on to better days. Can you, can you relate? Will you ask God to help you try? Want more?
