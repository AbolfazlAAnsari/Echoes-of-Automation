The Affordable Connectivity Program will stop accepting new enrollments at 11:59 p.m. ET Wednesday, a White House spokesperson confirmed. The cutoff comes as the program’s remaining funding is to set to run out in May. The Biden administration, which has previously called on Congress to provide an additional $6 billion to extend the program through the end of the year, again urged lawmakers to take action. “For President Biden, internet is like water,” Tom Perez, a senior adviser to the president and director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, told reporters on Tuesday. “It’s an essential public necessity that should be affordable and accessible to everyone.” “Just as we wouldn’t turn off the water pipes in a moment like this, we should never turn off the high-speed internet,” he added. “That is the pipeline to opportunity and access to health care for so many people across this country.” The Affordable Connectivity Program provides assistance to some 23 million households nationwide. Eligible low-income households can receive discounts of up to $30 per month on internet service, while eligible households on tribal lands can receive discounts of up to $75 per month. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which runs the program, warned lawmakers last month that it would have to begin the process of winding it down given the lack of funding. “Absent additional funding, we could lose the significant progress this program has made towards closing the digital divide,” FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a series of letters to congressional leaders. “Yet we have come too far with the [Affordable Connectivity Program] to turn back.” Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

The Clayton County Medical Examiner’s Office said Tuesday that newborn Treveon Taylor Jr.’s cause of death was a “fracture dislocation with complete transection (to the) upper cervical spine and spinal cord.” His death was caused by shoulder dystocia, arrest of labor and fetal entrapment in the birth canal. It also said pregnancy-induced diabetes and premature rupture of membranes contributed to his death. The medical examiner’s office said Treveon’s death was caused by the “actions of another person.” The newborn’s mother, 20 year-old Jessica Ross, went into labor at Southern Regional Medical Center on July 9 and reported experiencing complications during the birthing process. According to a lawsuit filed on behalf of the newborn’s parents in August, the baby’s shoulders got stuck in the vaginal canal, at which point a doctor allegedly performed a cesarean section too late and applied “excessive tension” on the baby’s head, causing it to detach from the body. The lawsuit claims the doctor did not tell the mother and father what had happened. Instead, hospital staff allegedly refused to let them hold the baby after death, the lawsuit claims. They showed the parents Treveon wrapped tightly in a blanket with his head propped on top, a statement said. It also says staff pressured the couple to cremate the remains and told them an autopsy wasn’t warranted. The family alleges they were not made aware of the decapitation until they received a concerning phone call from the Willie A. Watkins Funeral Home. “I just felt a sense of urgency to say, ‘Hey, listen, this is not right. Never seen it before,’” said Sylvania Watkins, the funeral home’s general manager, in August. Watkins found it peculiar to receive a decapitated baby from a hospital and not the medical examiner’s office or law enforcement. “With the body and the head being detached, we should have retrieved this body from the coroner’s office. When that did not happen, that’s when I said we need to reach out and back up and do it right,” Watkins said. The medical examiner’s office was alerted to the dead infant’s condition by the funeral home, launching an investigation into the matter shortly after. In August, Southern Regional shared the following statement, adding that they were not able to discuss details surrounding the birth due to HIPAA laws: Our heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with the family and all those impacted by this tragic event. Our prayers also remain with the dedicated team of physicians, nurses and staff at Southern Regional Medical Center who cared for this patient. As our deepest sympathies remain with the family, Southern Regional Medical Center denies the allegations of wrongdoing in the Complaint referencing the hospital. Due to patient privacy laws and HIPAA, we are unable to discuss the care and treatment of specific patients, but we can state this unfortunate infant death occurred in utero prior to the delivery and decapitation. The hospital voluntarily reported the death to the Clayton County Medical Examiner’s Office and is cooperating with all investigations. Since this matter is in litigation, we cannot provide additional statements.

LEILA FADEL, HOST: And days of rain in Southern California have turned hills into rivers of mud. Some homes have been washed away, and firefighters have been busy rescuing people from rushing waters and stranded vehicles. President Joe Biden called to offer federal assistance to LA Mayor Karen Bass. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We'll get any help on the way as soon as you guys request it, so just let me know. That's why I'm calling. KAREN BASS: OK. Well, thank you so much, Mr. President. MARTIN: NPR's Nathan Rott has been covering this storm from Ventura, on the California coast between LA and Santa Barbara, and he is with us now. Good morning, Nate. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Michel. MARTIN: So I understand that the president's call came during the mayor's press briefing last night, where she was describing what she saw. Can you just tell us what else she said and what she did see? ROTT: Yeah. So she had spent the day basically traveling around different parts of LA and looking at various homes and various parts of the city that have been impacted by mudflows. And when I say mudflows, I mean earth that had gotten so saturated with water that it basically turned into this thick, destructive soup. Our colleague Liz Baker visited a home in Culver City - which is its own city in LA - that's backyard is just now totally mud. Here's the home's owner, Ivo Panayotov. IVO PANAYOTOV: Grass turned upside down. There is actually one tree that is fallen from the mudslide. It looks like a hurricane went through it. ROTT: So LA Mayor Karen Bass and city officials said that more than 120 debris flows have been reported as of last night just in the city of Los Angeles alone, and we know that there have been many others in the broader region. MARTIN: Do we have any sense of how much longer these mudslides are going to be a risk for people? ROTT: I mean, as long as it keeps raining and probably a little bit after, 'cause when I say, like, the ground is saturated here, Michel, I mean, it is wet. You know, downtown Los Angeles got more than 6 inches of rain in less than 24 hours. Parts of the Santa Monica Mountains just north of the city had upwards of 10 inches. So any more rain on those areas could trigger additional debris flows. MARTIN: And do we have a sense of how much longer it's going to be raining? ROTT: Yeah, the question everybody wants to answer, right? I talked to a meteorologist at the National Weather Service here last night who said this river of transported tropical moisture, this atmospheric river is weakening, but it's definitely not over yet. It's raining right now outside of my house. And we should continue to see scattered showers and thunderstorms through Wednesday. But, you know, where I am, about an hour's drive north of Los Angeles, even with the rain, people are definitely feeling like the worst of this is over. I visited a part of Ventura yesterday that had been flooded earlier this week and talked to the owner of my favorite surf shop, which had water standing up to its entrance on Sunday, and they were able to keep it out with sandbags. The store's owner, Bill Hubina, says unless flood infrastructure gets improved in this area, in his opinion, he doesn't think they're going to continue to be so lucky in the future. BILL HUBINA: This will continue getting worse every year till we really do flood eventually. But it's just Mother Nature, and tides are rising and global warming, basically. MARTIN: So I heard him say it's global warming, Nate, but is that what's really driving these rains? ROTT: So this is a very complicated answer, Michel. Look; we know sea levels are rising. We know the coastlines are changing. With atmospheric rivers, it's a little more complicated. Basically, scientists know that human-caused climate change is making precipitation events more likely. Warm air holds more moisture. What - they have not detected a signal of that, though, in the data so far. MARTIN: That is NPR's Nathan Rott in Ventura, Calif. Nate, take care of yourself. ROTT: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: OK, this may sound confusing, but former President Donald Trump will not be on the ballot in today's primary in Nevada. FADEL: But he's assured to sweep the state's 26 delegates. That's because there are actually two nominating contests in Nevada - today's primary, which Nikki Haley is on the ballot for, and Thursday's caucus, where Trump is the only major candidate participating. MARTIN: NPR's Franco Ordoñez is in Las Vegas, where local voters are also trying to make sense of it all. Good morning, Franco. FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel. MARTIN: OK, simple question - why are there two contests? ORDOÑEZ: Yeah, it is a simple question, but not really a simple answer. It's kind of part of a conflict between the state Republican Party, which is run by Trump allies, and a state law that mandates the primary must be held. Nevada actually has long held caucuses, but the state Legislature passed a law in 2021 switching to a more straightforward primary vote. But the nominating contests are run by political parties and not the state, and the Nevada Republican Party decided to stick with a caucus, which awards the 26 delegates. So voters will be heading to the polls today, and Nikki Haley is almost guaranteed to win, but it's largely a symbolic victory. MARTIN: You've been talking to voters. What do they make of all this? Are they able to make sense of this? ORDOÑEZ: I mean, it's caused a lot of problems. I was out talking to voters yesterday. I mean, there were some Republicans who still didn't know whether they should be voting in the primary or the caucus. You know, I talked with Kathy Eskandani (ph) just south of the strip. She kind of summed up the feelings of a lot of voters here. KATHY ESKANDANI: I was shocked. I looked at my sample ballot and told my husband, Donald Trump isn't on the ballot. Like, what is that? Nikki Haley's there, a couple other names I didn't know, but no Trump. ORDOÑEZ: And even more confusing, registered Republicans can vote in both the primary and the caucus. There's no law prohibiting them from doing so. So all of this has just led to accusations of conspiracy and election fraud. Chuck Muth, a local Republican political consultant, told me it just makes the state look bad. CHUCK MUTH: It's a total disaster from a public relations standpoint 'cause even active Republicans who are very attuned to what's going on are completely confused by why this is being done the way it's being done. ORDOÑEZ: Now, Michel, on the flip side, there are local - other local pundits that say that, or at least told me that it's raised attention about the contest and may have actually boosted Republican registration. MARTIN: OK. So what do we think this means for the race? ORDOÑEZ: It's all just kind of weird. I mean, you're basically going to have two winners this week in Nevada. You know, there's also a lot of talk in political circles that more people could show up at the primaries, and Haley could get more votes than Trump does in the caucuses. That would certainly be embarrassing for Trump. So I'll be watching for that. But again, if it does, it won't change the fact that Trump gets all the delegates. MARTIN: OK. Reminder - Republicans aren't the only ones voting this week, though, right? The Democrats are, too, right? ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. You're absolutely right. I mean, while Republicans are also trying to figure all their stuff out, Democrats are also voting today, and it's also an election with a clear winner in President Biden. So while the outcome for the primary may be set, Nevada is just such an important state in the general election. It's actually the first of the big six swing states to vote in a primary, making it extra important. The campaigns are out looking to test messaging and get any information they can as they prepare for November. MARTIN: That's NPR's Franco Ordoñez in Las Vegas. Franco, thank you. ORDOÑEZ: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Dartmouth College, an Ivy League school in New Hampshire, announced it is reinstating standardized testing requirements - the SAT or the ACT - as a requirement for admission after going test-optional during the pandemic.

It\'s believed that Naudia Wesley, 27, was killed on Nov. 13, but the information is limited on the circumstances surrounding her death. Denver Police declined to provide additional information when asked why investigators believed Wesley was killed on Nov. 13. Denver Police said they got a tip that 26-year-old Keelynn Ashworth had murdered an unknown woman, but when asked, would not say specifically when they received that tip. On Dec. 1, investigators went to Ashworth\'s apartment to execute a search warrant, but he refused to come out, police said. On that day, police said on social media that they executed a search warrant in the 6800 block of East Iliff Avenue, and when officers did they heard a gunshot inside an apartment. The man inside was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Denver Police said. The Denver Medical Examiner\'s Officer confirmed the man found dead at the location was Ashworth. The initial tip to Denver Police didn\'t include the name of the victim or any identifying information, and at the time, Wesley had not been reported missing, according to Denver Police. On Tuesday, a spokesman said, ""It took some skilled police and forensic work to learn Naudia’s identity and confirm that she was the victim of this crime."" Police said it remains an active investigation as they continue seeking more information surrounding the events.

But Harry did not see his estranged brother, William, during a visit that lasted scarcely 24 hours. The royal brothers remain emotionally and physically an ocean apart. British media published photos of Harry at Heathrow Airport on Wednesday afternoon, just a day after he arrived at the same airport on a flight from Los Angeles. He appeared headed back to life in California after a U.K. visit in which he spent less than an hour with his father at Clarence House, the king’s London home. Any meeting between the brothers would typically be confirmed by palace officials. William, meanwhile, returned to public duties for the first time since his wife, Kate, was admitted to a London hospital on Jan. 16 for abdominal surgery. She spent almost two weeks at the private London Clinic and is recovering at home. William handed out medals to notables and local heroes at a Windsor Castle ceremony in the morning and was due to attend a charity dinner on Wednesday evening for London’s air ambulance service. Images from the day are more grist for the popular British media tropes: dutiful William, flyaway Harry. Behind that simplistic summary are two royal brothers — bonded in bereavement by the death of their mother, Princess Diana, when William was 15 and Harry was 12 — whose paths have diverged dramatically. While William, the heir, was destined from birth to be king, Harry, who is fifth in line to the throne behind his brother and William’s three children, has often appeared to struggle with the more ambiguous role of “spare.” He chose “Spare” as the title of his 2023 memoir, which recounted a lifetime of sibling grievances — from William getting the bigger bedroom at Balmoral Castle to a ferocious argument in which Harry claims William ripped his necklace and knocked him down onto a dog bowl. In the book, Harry alleged that the British media treated him and his wife, Meghan — also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex — as villains compared with virtuous William and Kate, and accused palace officials of lying to protect his elder brother. The Sussexes cited the media’s racist treatment of Meghan, who is biracial, and a lack of support from the palace as reasons for their decision in 2020 to quit royal duties and move to the U.S. In an explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, the couple portrayed the royal family as indifferent to Meghan’s mental health struggles, and suggested an unnamed family member had made a racist comment to Harry before the birth of their son, Archie. Harry described his relationship with William as “space at the moment.” The brothers’ interactions since then have been formal, and brief. They were seen temporarily putting their fraught relationship aside to attend the funeral of their grandfather Prince Philip at Windsor Castle in 2021. The pair did not walk side-by-side behind Philip’s coffin, but were pictured chatting and walking together after the service. In September 2022 the brothers walked side-by-side behind the coffin of their grandmother Queen Elizabeth II before she lay in state. William later said it had evoked memories of doing the same at Princess Diana’s funeral in 1997. Harry traveled to the U.K. for his father’s coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey in May. He was assigned to sit two rows behind his brother, arrived at the abbey alone and left alone. The brothers were not seen speaking or even acknowledging each other. Harry’s campaign to tame Britain’s tabloid press has also placed him at odds with his relatives.

Before the border vote Schumer, D-N.Y., released a new bill that stripped border provisions from the $118 billion bipartisan package. Schumer said he aimed to move forward with the legislation on Wednesday but the timing is unclear. Senators huddled throughout the border vote to discuss a path forward. Some Republicans are requesting commitments on amendments or other concessions before deciding if they will agree to start debate on that bill. Schumer called out Republicans who demanded that aid to Ukraine be linked to changes in the Biden administration\'s border policies, only to walk away from a bipartisan proposal that a top GOP senator and Republican leadership aides were involved in crafting. He said he still hoped they would agree to debate the border deal, but had lined up a backup plan in consultation with the White House to move the billions in money for Ukraine, Israel and humanitarian assistance for civilians impacted in conflict zones. ""Well, we\'re going to give them both options. We\'ll take either one. We just hope they can come to yes on something,"" Schumer said. He suggested to reporters he believed the national security funding bill minus the border deal had the 60 votes it would need to advance. He vowed there would be a ""fair and open process on amendments."" The top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., initially signaled he favored moving the legislation supporting key allies.

Please enter a search term. by: Darren Sweeney, Alicia Patton, Matthew Knight Posted: Feb 6, 2024 / 03:18 AM MST Updated: Feb 6, 2024 / 08:29 AM MST by: Darren Sweeney, Alicia Patton, Matthew Knight Posted: Feb 6, 2024 / 03:18 AM MST Updated: Feb 6, 2024 / 08:29 AM MST NASHVILLE (WJW) — Country singer-songwriter Toby Keith, who had been battling stomach cancer, has died at 62, according to his website. “Toby Keith passed peacefully last night on February 5th, surrounded by his family,” a statement on his Facebook page said. “He fought his fight with grace and courage. Please respect the privacy of his family at this time.” Keith leaves behind a wife and three children. Keith announced his cancer diagnosis on social media in June of 2022. He said at the time that he had spent six months undergoing chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. After his diagnosis, he told FOX News in September of 2023 that “I lean on my faith.” “I just pray and lean into it,” Keith told the outlet. “It was my rock.” “You get good days and, you know, you’re up and down. … It’s always zero to 60 and 60 to zero, but I feel good today,” he said at the time. The 6-foot-4 singer broke out in the country boom years of the 1990s, writing songs that fans loved to hear. Over his career he publicly clashed with other celebrities and journalists and often pushed back against record executives who wanted to smooth his rough edges. He was known for his overt patriotism on post 9/11 songs like “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue,” and boisterous barroom tunes like “I Love This Bar” and “Red Solo Cup.” He had a powerful booming voice, a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor and range that carried love songs as well as drinking songs. Among his 20 No. 1 Billboard hits were “How Do You Like Me Now?!,” “Should’ve Been a Cowboy,” “As Good As I Once Was,” “My List” and “Beer for My Horses,” a duet with Willie Nelson. Keith worked as a roughneck in the oil fields of Oklahoma as a young man, then played semi-pro football before launching his career as a singer. “I write about life, and I sing about life, and I don’t overanalyze things,” Keith told The Associated Press in 2001, following the success of his song “I’m Just Talking About Tonight.” Keith learned good lessons in the booming oil fields, which toughened him up, but also showed him the value of money. “The money to be made was unbelievable,” Keith told the AP in 1996. “I came out of high school in 1980 and they gave me this job December of 1979, $50,000 a year. I was 18-years-old.” But the domestic oil field industry collapsed and Keith had not saved. “It about broke us,” he said. “So I just learned. I’ve taken care of my money this time.” He spent a couple seasons as a defensive end for the Oklahoma City Drillers, a farm team for the now-defunct United States Football League. But he found consistent money playing music with his band throughout the red dirt roadhouse circuit in Oklahoma and Texas. “All through this whole thing the only constant thing we had was music,” he said. “But it’s hard to sit back and say, ‘I’m going to go make my fortune singing music, or writing music. I had no contacts.”‘ Eventually his path took him to Nashville, where he attracted the interest of Mercury Records head Harold Shedd, who was best known as a producer for the hit group Alabama. Shedd brought him to Mercury, where he released his platinum debut record “Toby Keith,” in 1993. “Should’ve Been a Cowboy,” his breakout hit, was played 3 million times on radio stations, making it the most played country song of the 1990s. But label’s focus on global star Shania Twain overshadowed the rest of the roster and Keith felt that the executives were trying to push him in a pop direction. “They were trying to get me to compromise, and I was living a miserable existence,” Keith told the AP. “Everybody was trying to mold me into something I was not.” After a series of albums that produced hits like “Who’s That Man,” and cover of Sting’s “I’m So Happy I Can’t Stop Crying,” Keith moved to DreamWorks Records in 1999. That’s when his multi-week “How Do You Like Me Now?!” took off and became his first song to crossover to Top 40 charts. In 2001, he won the male vocalist of the year and album of the year at the Academy of Country Music Awards, exclaiming from the stage: “I’ve waited a long time for this. Nine years!” Songs like “I Wanna Talk About Me,” a spoken-word song written by Bobby Braddock about a man frustrated by a talkative partner, got him attention for its similarity to the cadence of rap, which Keith dismissed. “They’re going to call it a rap song, (although) there ain’t nobody doing rap who would call it rap,” he told “Billboard” magazine in 2001. Keith often wore his politics on his sleeve, especially after the terrorist attacks on U.S. soil in 2001, and early on he said was a conservative Democrat, but later claimed he was an independent. He’s played at events for Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, the latter giving him a National Medal of the Arts in 2021. His songs and his blunt opinions sometimes caused him controversy, which he seemed to court. His 2002 song, “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)” included a threat— “We’ll put a boot in your ass — It’s the American way” — to anyone who dared to mess with America. That song got pulled from a patriotic ABC Fourth of July special after producers deemed it too angry for the show. Singer-songwriter Steve Earle called Keith’s song “pandering to people’s worst instincts at a time they are hurt and scared.” Then there was the feud between Keith and The Chicks (formerly called the Dixie Chicks), who became a target of Keith’s ire when singer Natalie Maines told a crowd that they were ashamed of then President George W. Bush. Maines had also previously called Keith’s song “ignorant.” Keith, who had previously claimed that he supported any artist’s freedom to voice their opinion about politics, used a doctored photo of Maines with an image of Saddam Hussein at his concerts, further ramping up angry fans. Maines responded by wearing a shirt with the letters “FUTK” onstage at the 2003 ACM Awards, which many people believed was a vulgar message to Keith. He also publicly called out actor Ethan Hawke, who had written a story in “Rolling Stone” that described an argument between Kris Kristofferson and an unnamed country star that sounded a lot like Keith. During a backstage press conference during an awards show, Keith was furious at Hawke (and reporters for repeating the story) for what he called a “fictitious (expletive) lie.” Keith, who has acknowledged that he holds onto grudges, walked out of the ACM Awards in 2003 early because he had gotten snubbed in earlier categories, causing him to miss out when he was announced as entertainer of the year. Vince Gill accepted on his behalf. He came back the next year and won the top prize for a second year in a row, along with top male vocalist and album of the year for “Shock ’n Y’all.” His pro-military stance wasn’t just fodder for songs, however. He went on 11 USO tours to visit and play for troops serving overseas. He also helped to raised millions for charity over his career, including building a home in Oklahoma City for kids and their families who are battling cancer. After Universal Music Group acquired DreamWorks, Keith started anew again, starting his own record label, Show Dog, in 2005 with record executive Scott Borchetta, who launched his own label Big Machine at the same time. “Probably 75% of the people in this town think I’ll fail, and the other 25% hope I fail,” he said that year. Later the label became Show Dog-Universal Music and had Keith, Trace Adkins, Joe Nichols, Josh Thompson, Clay Walker and Phil Vassar on its roster. His later hits included “Love Me If You Can,” “She Never Cried In Front of Me,” and “Red Solo Cup.” He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2015. He was honored by the performance rights organization BMI in November 2022 with the BMI Icon award, a few months after announcing his stomach cancer diagnosis. “I always felt like that the songwriting was the most important part of this whole industry,” Keith told the crowd of fellow singers and writers.

circulating among online communities warned of Denver sending “thousands of migrants” to Lakewood. It also warned of the Lakewood City Council’s imminent plans to designate itself a “sanctuary city,” among several other false claims. Shortly after the poster was sent out, the city refuted the claims. It stated that Lakewood officials met with Denver counterparts to discuss the ongoing arrivals of immigrants from the southern border and potential ways the cities could help each other. Lakewood officials also said they had no plans to consider becoming a “sanctuary city.” Immigration experts, such as University of Colorado law professor Deep Gulasekaram, said the very concept of becoming a “sanctuary city” is flawed. “There is no legal definition of sanctuary city,” Gulasekaram said. “It's a term that is an empty vessel in a sense, and so anybody from any part of the political spectrum can put into it what they want.” Many cities pass ordinances to declare themselves a “welcoming city”, which are largely symbolic gestures that signal immigrants are welcome to start new lives there. From there, cities may choose to pass additional ordinances that build on that designation and create further protections and services for immigrants. “San Francisco, for example, then added to its welcoming city ordinance, a city ordinance that said that for city purposes, officials are not going to ask about immigration status,” Gulasekaram said. “Now, you could go a little further than that and say, not only is your federal immigration status irrelevant to city services or public benefits within this area, you could say law enforcement officials are never going to, within our city, within our county, ask about your immigration status.” Perhaps the furthest a city or jurisdiction can go to protect its new immigrant residents is placing limitations on how local law enforcement authorities can interact with federal immigration officials. But those come with their own limitations. Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said even the most protective laws cannot stop the federal government from doing its job. “The federal government always can go out and do its own investigations, make its own arrests,” he said. “It can do that anywhere in any city.” In 2019, lawmakers passed HB19-1124, which grants protection to Colorado residents against the federal government. The bill, among other things, prevents law enforcement officers from arresting or detaining an individual on the basis of their immigration status. It also prevents authorities from providing an individual’s immigration status to federal officials. Officers can continue to assist federal immigration enforcement officials with executing warrants issued by federal judges. The word “sanctuary” never appears in the bill. The bill, like many state laws, takes precedence over local rules set by city councils or county authorities. However, the bill leaves room for cities to pass stronger protections. For example, by the time HB19-1124 was passed, Denver had already passed its own immigrant protection ordinances. Raquel Lane, communications manager with the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, said those ordinances included the typical stipulations that prevent Denver officers from coordinating with federal entities.

Other cities are less likely to pass their own immigrant protections. Officials from El Paso County and Colorado Springs called a press conference in late January to comment on the arrival of immigrants. “Allow me to state unequivocally that we will not be designated as a sanctuary county,” said El Paso Board of Commissioners Chair Cami Bremer.

temporary peace in Gaza? MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Israel, trying to work out terms for Israel to stop its military campaign in Gaza. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANTONY BLINKEN: That offers the prospect of extended calm, hostages out, more assistance in. That would clearly be beneficial to everyone. And I think that offers the best path forward. But there\'s a lot of work to be done to achieve it. MARTIN: The U.S. and Israel have been trading messages with Hamas. It is a slow negotiation, with Qatar passing notes back-and-forth. Qatar says the latest response from Hamas is, quote-unquote, ""positive."" And in Gaza, people in the streets are calling on Israel to accept it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting in non-English language). MARTIN: They\'re chanting, the people want peace right now. INSKEEP: NPR\'s Michele Kelemen is traveling with Secretary Blinken. She\'s in Tel Aviv. Hey there, Michele. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: Is a deal imminent? KELEMEN: Not imminent. You know, it took Hamas well over a week to respond to the latest deal that was on the table. Both Qatar and Egypt have had a tough time getting a timely response, in part because it\'s just hard to communicate with Hamas leaders inside Gaza as Israel continues to pursue them. But the Qataris say that Hamas has now agreed to kind of this framework of a deal. They\'ve offered what some are calling a counterproposal, and now we\'re expecting to see some more negotiations on those details. INSKEEP: OK. What is the framework, so-called? KELEMEN: It would be in phases, basically. The first phase would last about 45 days. That would be a period of calm. Hamas would release women and children and some elderly hostages that they\'ve been holding since October 7, and Israel would release some Palestinian prisoners. Now, Hamas wants prisoners who are serving life sentences in Israel out of jail. They also say they\'ve proposed some numbers, though that ratio of hostages to prisoners seems to be one of those issues that\'s still being negotiated. In other phases of the deal, we might see Israeli troops repositioning and Hamas releasing female soldiers, followed by male soldiers and the bodies of dead hostages. Israel says that Hamas is holding about 31 bodies - 29 of them were taken during the October 7 attack - and it believes that there are still about a hundred hostages taken that day who are still alive. INSKEEP: So negotiation over living hostages, over the bodies of hostages. And aside from that, isn\'t there a big disagreement about the longer term? KELEMEN: Yeah. I mean, Hamas wants a permanent cease-fire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to keep fighting Hamas until Hamas is destroyed. And the U.S. is basically just hoping that if there\'s a pause in fighting that\'s long enough, it could give everyone more room for diplomacy. And there are a lot of big ideas floating around about that, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, big ideas - does this include some path forward for a Palestinian state, a two-state solution? KELEMEN: Yeah, and a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Blinken was just in Saudi Arabia, and he says the crown prince is interested in pursuing that, but a couple of things are required first. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BLINKEN: An end to the conflict in Gaza and a clear, credible, time-bound path to the establishment of a Palestinian state. KELEMEN: Now, Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly said he doesn\'t want a two-state solution, but Blinken knows that Israel does want normal ties with the Saudis and needs Arab states to support a postwar Gaza. So he\'ll be talking about all of that here with Netanyahu. INSKEEP: NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen in Tel Aviv. Michele, thanks, as always, for your insights. KELEMEN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK, in this country, House Republicans are regrouping after a failed vote to impeach the Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, for the crisis at the southern border. MARTIN: With a border security deal on the verge of imploding on Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats are moving in completely opposite directions on immigration ahead of a key procedural vote, which is scheduled for today. President Joe Biden slammed Republicans who plan to sink the bipartisan legislation, even though the White House agreed to the measures they wanted. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: It\'s time for Republicans in the Congress to show a little courage, to show a little spine, to make it clear to the American people that you work for them, not for anyone else. INSKEEP: NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales joins us this morning. Claudia, good morning. CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, I\'m trying to figure this out. Republicans demanded some border security measures. Democrats finally said yes to some of them, anyway. GRISALES: Right. INSKEEP: And then Republicans said, actually, no. How did that happen? GRISALES: Yes. They spent a lot of months on negotiating this $118 billion bipartisan deal. And yes, Republicans initially said no to foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel without this border deal. McConnell and other Republicans warned that this is probably the best deal they could get, even comparing it to a Republican-controlled Congress and White House. But now McConnell is singing a different tune with House Republicans starting this momentum for senators - Republican senators - to vote against this plan. So he told reporters all this after applauding all the negotiations on it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: But it looks to me and to most of our members as if we have no real chance here to make a law. INSKEEP: And I guess we should underline why it would seem to be that they would have no real chance to make it law. Why would that be? GRISALES: Because there just was not enough support there because Senate Republicans had turned on the plan, too. INSKEEP: And that would have to do with Donald Trump. GRISALES: Exactly. So that really started pressure, especially for House Speaker Mike Johnson, who really started this momentum for House Republicans to say, we\'re not even going to take up this plan if it were even to pass in the Senate. INSKEEP: Wasn\'t there also an effort yesterday to just strip out the immigration part, even strip out the Ukraine part and just pass military aid to Israel in the House of Representatives? GRISALES: Yes. Speaker Mike Johnson was unable to pass this $17.6 billion in military aid to Israel. There was just too much opposition there, even on both sides. And Biden also had threatened to veto the bill. INSKEEP: OK. How does election year politics, the fact that it\'s 2024 and there are presidential primaries underway - how does that play into this? GRISALES: That plays a huge role. For example, if you were to, say, fix the border with this legislation, Republicans will lose that argument as a big talking point on the campaign trail. So there\'s definitely a political calculation here for the GOP, who want to preserve their best shot for presenting the best argument for the election. And especially when you look at the presidential race with Trump as the presumed GOP presidential nominee, he was adamantly opposed to this. Quickly, House Republicans, Speaker Johnson followed suit. And now we\'re seeing Senate Republicans fall in line as well. INSKEEP: So how did the House fail to impeach Secretary Mayorkas, which was supposed to be part of their campaign push? GRISALES: Well, there were three Republicans who joined Democrats to vote against the measure, so too many for this narrow GOP majority. They could still revisit this effort later. But it\'s another reminder how far apart both these parties remain. INSKEEP: OK, just the facts. NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales, thanks, as always. GRISALES: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Ethan Crumbley was 15 years old when he committed a mass shooting at Michigan\'s Oxford High School a few years ago. A judge sent him to prison for life. Yesterday, a jury found his mother shares responsibility. MARTIN: A jury found Jennifer Crumbley guilty of four counts of involuntary manslaughter. She faces many years in prison. And Ethan\'s father, James Crumbley, still faces involuntary manslaughter charges. And this raises the question, at what point do parents share criminal responsibility for a child\'s gun crimes? INSKEEP: NPR law enforcement correspondent Martin Kaste joins us now. Martin, good morning. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Does this case set a new standard? KASTE: Well, it\'s not clear that this suddenly makes gun-owning parents more criminally liable for their children\'s actions because experts call this an extreme case. It\'s less about how Ethan got the gun, and this is more about how Jennifer Crumbley ignored clear warnings that'}]"
