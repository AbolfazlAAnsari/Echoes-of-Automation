Lindell went public on Friday, sharing a video on X, where, apart from pleading for monetary support in a time of “cancelation,” he expressed suspicions that the network is “getting rid” of “his voice.” In the Friday video, Lindell speculated that Fox is silencing him because his online platform TV/FrankSpeech online channel hired former Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, who recently interviewed former President Trump. Dobbs’s show was canceled three years ago. The MyPillow CEO also quipped it is because he wants to “secure our election platforms,” something that Fox also denies. Fox disputes Lindell’s claims, saying that the removal of the ads was due to financial issues. “As soon as their account is paid, we would be happy to accept their advertising,” Fox spokeswoman Irena Briganti told the Associated Press. Lindell admitted that he owes $7.7 million to Fox and that, on average, he spent $1 million a week to run his ads on the network. Lindell acknowledged in an interview in October that he owed two law firms that were defending him against lawsuits by Dominion and Smartmatic millions of dollars that he couldn’t pay, which is why they quit. He said MyPillow had been “decimated.” But Lindell insisted Friday that MyPillow is “doing great.” He said it’s still running ads on another conservative network, Newsmax, and on his own platforms. But he conceded that losing Fox will hurt the business and said he would run his ads there again if Fox would take them. “Obviously, it would be great if Fox said, ‘Hey, come back,’” Lindell said.

'Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video MARTINSVILLE, Ind. — It\'s been a week since a sheriff\'s deputy was shot in the line of duty in Morgan County. Investigators say a 15-year-old shot Morgan County Sheriff\'s Deputy Mallory Schwab in the shoulder when she went to his house for a welfare check. SWAT officers later found his body in a bedroom. No weapons were fired by law enforcement that day. As Indiana State Police continue to investigate the shooting, we\'re hearing from Schwab for the first time. She talked exclusively with 13News reporter Jennie Runevitch about her injury, recovery and gratitude to the community. Schwab has made the walk into work at the Morgan County Sheriff\'s Office almost every day since joining the department a month ago. But now, she said just being here is a blessing. Schwab\'s career protecting the public easily could have ended when law enforcement risk collided with reality last week. ""Like for the worst scenario, I got extremely lucky,"" Schwab said. While responding to a welfare check for a teenager in crisis, investigators say a gunshot from inside the home on Beech Grove Road hit Schwab and sent her to the ground. ""It felt like something, like a rock got thrown at my shoulder,"" Schwab said. ""That\'s what it felt like at first, and then, I quickly realized that it was not a rock, it was actually a shot."" RELATED: Morgan County sheriff\'s deputy released from hospital after being shot by 15-year-old in Martinsville; suspect found dead in home Schwab can\'t talk about the specifics of the shooting investigation, but here\'s what she did share about that day and the fact that a young life also ended. ""It was a sad situation in the end. It\'s not the outcome everybody wanted, but you just can only pray for their family,"" Schwab said. ""My training kicked in, and I believe we did the right thing at the time, and that\'s what will stick in my mind."" She said after the gunfire, things moved fast. ""All the deputies, it was, \'Get cover, and get me out of there.\' It all just kicked in, and we did what we had to in that chaos,"" she said. On the 40-minute ambulance ride to IU Health Methodist Hospital, she was able to call her parents and let them hear her voice. ""I just said I was OK, and that I\'ll see you guys in a little bit, but just know that, yes it\'s a bad situation, but I\'m OK,"" Schwab said. That\'s also when she started to marvel at the massive support from Morgan County law enforcement. Schwab has spent her whole life here. She served for years with Martinsville Police prior to joining the sheriff\'s department. ""At one point, I looked out the back window and saw 10-12 police cars behind us and having the escort, pretty sure I saw some exit ramps shut down, and they had pretty much the whole interstate shut down, it felt like,"" Schwab said. In the hospital, doctors discovered the bullet went straight through her shoulder. Just hours after getting shot in the line of duty, she was able to go home. A brace limits motion in her right arm (Schwab is right-handed). She said doctors will make a decision on surgery next month. ""It broke my shoulder, not only just the (bullet) wounds, but I\'m dealing with a broken shoulder right here,"" Schwab said. RELATED: ISP trooper struck on I-65, Morgan County deputy shot during welfare check to receive $2K grants from nonprofit Over the past week, community support has been helping her heal — from strangers to schoolkids sending her cards. ""It\'s not, \'What have they done?\'"" Schwab said. ""What haven\'t they done? Everybody has reached out, even people that I don\'t know. Schools keep sending me cards. I\'ve got a stack at home that I read all the time, so it\'s great. I\'m very grateful for everything."" And despite the danger that threatened her life, the knowledge that risk is still part of the job, Schwab wants to be back on duty soon. She\'s been an Army reservist for 12 years in addition to her time as a police officer and deputy. She said there\'s no other job she\'d rather do than protect the public. ""Yes, we have risk in this job,"" Schwab said. ""But also, there\'s other people that need us and need us to be there for them, and I\'ll continue as much as I can. I\'m ready to get back out there."" Schwab doesn\'t have a specific return date yet, but this Friday, she\'ll receive a donation from a charity that helps first responders.

Washington (CNN) — The Illinois State Board of Elections voted unanimously Tuesday to dismiss a challenge to former President Donald Trump’s candidacy, but the decision is not expected to be the final word in the matter, with an appeal all but assured. The panel voted 8-0 on a bipartisan basis to dismiss the challenge, finding that it didn’t have jurisdiction to adjudicate a dispute involving the 14th Amendment.

A full copy of the lawsuit can be found at the bottom of this article. SALT LAKE CITY (KTVX) – The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is facing another lawsuit over the alleged misuse of member tithings – this time filed in the state of California by a married couple. This is the latest lawsuit to come from the fallout of whistleblower David Nielson, a former senior portfolio manager with the Church’s investment arm, Ensign Peak Advisors. In December 2019, Nielson claimed the Church misused billions of dollars in tithes, including $1.4 billion to fund the City Creek Center in downtown Salt Lake City. The plaintiffs, Gene and Michelle Judson, who have been members of the Church since 1967 and 1971, respectively, echoed Nielson’s claims in their lawsuit. The California couple explained in court documents that they believed their tithing was to be used for charitable and welfare purposes or to build and maintain temples and support missionary work. Instead, they claim the Church used their tithes – an estimated $40,000 between 2003 and 2020 – to help fund the construction of the City Creek Center mall in downtown Salt Lake City. The Judsons described themselves in court documents as “not wealthy” and at times living on limited means, but still routinely paid tithing on an annual basis, until recently. “The misrepresentation made by Defendants through their agents and employees — including the president of the LDS Church and other high-ranking LDS Church leaders who were also members of Defendant LDS Corporation — that tithing funds would not be used to finance City Creek Center or other commercial, for-profit, purposes were false, intentional, and made to induce Plaintiffs and Class Members to pay tithing funds in spite of Defendants having amassed a $100 billion fund,” alleges the lawsuit. Nexstar’s KTVX has reached out to the Church for comment on the newest lawsuit but has not received a reply by the time of publication. In the past, the Church has repeatedly stated that it did not use tithing funds for projects such as the City Creek Center, but rather the interest from investments. The Judsons are asking to be awarded damages not only for themselves but for class members also affected by the alleged tithing misuse. This is the second such lawsuit filed against the Church in California and the third lawsuit overall since Nielson made his allegations. In 2019, James Huntsman, the brother of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr., filed for the return of the $5 million he donated before he left the Church. Another lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court of Utah in October 2023 by three Church members claiming to have donated a collective total of $350,000 over the years they say were also misused. The Church has previously sought to dismiss the lawsuit filed by Huntsman and has so far found limited success. A U.S. District Court dismissed Huntsman’s lawsuit in September 2021; however, two years later, that ruling was overturned and the lawsuit was reinstated.

Please enter a search term. by: Matt Adams Posted: Feb 1, 2024 / 10:01 AM EST Updated: Feb 1, 2024 / 10:32 AM EST by: Matt Adams Posted: Feb 1, 2024 / 10:01 AM EST Updated: Feb 1, 2024 / 10:32 AM EST While he’s no longer on the case, Allen County Chief Public Defender Bill Lebrato hasn’t seen anything quite like the Delphi murders. Lebrato appeared on FOX59 Morning News from Allen County to discuss the proceedings. “This case has been unusual from the beginning,” Lebrato said. “It has garnered so much media attention nationally. When I was still attorney of record, I would get calls from other countries. So, no, I’ve never seen so many twists and turns in a case.” Special Judge Fran Gull appointed Lebrato and attorney Robert Scremin to represent Richard Allen, who faces two counts of murder in connection with the February 2017 deaths of Abby Williams and Libby German near the Monon High Bridge in Delphi. The appointments came after Allen’s original defense team, Bradley Rozzi and Andrew Baldwin, withdrew from the case over an evidence leak in October. Rozzi and Baldwin later said they withdrew under pressure and fought for reinstatement. The battle eventually made its way to the Indiana Supreme Court, which decided to reinstate the attorneys. The court, which chose Gull to oversee the case when the original judge recused himself, decided to keep Gull as presiding judge. Last week, with Rozzi’s and Baldwin’s status as Allen’s attorneys restored, Lebrato and Scremin filed a motion to withdraw as his representation. As a result, the attorneys are no longer bound by the case’s longstanding gag order. Lebrato covered several aspects of the case during an interview on FOX59 Morning News. Lebrato commented on the “Odinism theory” laid out by attorneys Rozzi and Baldwin in the memorandum in support of their motion for a Franks hearing challenging the validity of the search warrant granted for Allen’s home. The defense’s alternative murder theory, laid out in the 136-page memorandum, alleged that the girls were killed in “ritualistic” fashion by adherents of a white supremacist cult called “Odinism.” Carroll County Prosecutor Nick McLeland called the theory “a fanciful defense for social media to devour.” Lebrato had no idea about Odinism—he told FOX59’s Angela Ganote he’d never heard of it before the case—but learned a great deal about it in the course of defending Allen. “There are people that follow this Odin religion,” he said. “There are people that were very brazen at the time of the murders on their Facebook accounts about being part of this Odinistic cult. Whether they’re responsible, I don’t know. I don’t want to get into what our legal defense theory would’ve been because I don’t want to hinder the current attorneys.” Lebrato characterized Allen as “soft spoken” and “engaged” in his defense. Indiana State Police announced his arrest in October 2022. He’s been in captivity ever since, spending most of his time at Westville Correctional Facility before being moved to Wabash Valley Correctional Facility in late 2023. Both his current and former attorneys have filed motions seeking to have him transferred to a different facility. “He’s always very respectful to us in our meetings with him,” Lebrato said. “I think he’s not guilty or innocent because I believe the presumption of innocence is one of the most important legal theories that we have. That presumption of innocence carries with him through every stage of the trial, until the jury has heard all the evidence, including closing arguments, and until they deliberate. That presumption of innocence follows him the whole way.” When asked about his message to the families of Abby Williams and Libby German, Lebrato said he believed it was important to get this case right. “My heart goes out to the families of those two little girls. I mean, this was a horrific, horrific crime,” he said. “But I’m sure the families want to make sure that law enforcement not only arrests but convicts the right person or people that were involved in this heinous crime.” Lebrato thinks highly of Special Judge Fran Gull. He’s practiced law in front of Gull for more than two decades and believes she can be impartial, despite calls from the defense to have her removed from the proceedings. One of those efforts failed, when the state’s highest court decided to keep her on the case. Allen’s attorneys filed a motion this week seeking the judge’s recusal and questioning her impartiality. “Judge Gull knows no other way than to be fair,” he said. “She does not play favorites. The Supreme Court didn’t pick her name out of a hat. They chose her for a specific reason. In their ruling, they unanimously voted that Judge Gull stays on this case.” He said her “ethical and moral standards” were beyond reproach. When asked if he would return to the case in defense of Allen, Lebrato said that decision was out of his hands. “If I was ever to be put back on the case, this is not a decision I would be in position to make,” he said. “If for some reason, Judge Gull wanted to appoint our office again, it would make sense since my defense team was on this case for 79 days and we’ve got a pretty good grasp of what we’re after and what we need to do.” Allen’s trial is currently scheduled for October.
