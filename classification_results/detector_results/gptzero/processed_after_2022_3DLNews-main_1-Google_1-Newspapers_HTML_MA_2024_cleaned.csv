MOCHA has hosted several informational sessions about vaccines that protect against COVID-19, the flu and respiratory syncytial virus, commonly known as RSV. The events, the next of which will take place in March, are organized at such locations as churches, high-rise apartments, senior facilities and Tower Square. After a presentation, organizers help people with paperwork and navigating health insurance requirements.

about his band, Sevendust, when in an interview on the Jamey Jasta Show he indicated there wouldn’t be many tours left for the band. Soon, as other online and print outlets began spreading the news about Rose’s comments, the internet was abuzz with speculation that Sevendust was on the verge of plotting a final tour and calling it a career. Various members of Sevendust were quick to clarify the situation, saying Rose’s words may have been taken out of context and assuring fans that the band is far from finished. Now a year later, Sevendust has released a spirited new album called “Truth Killer” and is back on tour, with a stop Feb. 16 at the Palladium in Worcester. Singer Lajon Witherspoon is nothing if not excited about the future of his band. “Tomorrow, I’ll be 51 years old,” he said, before stopping himself to note he surprised himself by revealing that detail. “I still feel like I’m 20 (or something), let’s not say 20. I feel a lot younger than 51, you know what I’m saying. It (the band) keeps us young. I feel like there’s still a long way for Sevendust to go. We’ve still got a lot of gas.” If anything, Sevendust may be experiencing something of a rebirth ― or at least opening a new chapter in a career that now spans 14 albums, and as of 2024, 30 years. “Truth Killer” marks the veteran band’s first album after signing with Napalm Records, and there’s been a whole new energy around the project, Witherspoon said. “Napalm’s just great,” the singer said, noting that being on Napalm will allow Sevendust to build their touring base overseas and expand that audience. “Right out of the gate we started doing videos and press. Everybody from everywhere I’ve talked to, from Belgium, I mean, just amazing interviews. It’s been exciting. You know something good is going on if that is happening. It’s been a pleasure to be involved with these people.” And the actual writing and recording of “Truth Killer” was rejuvenating as well. Early on, all five band members —Witherspoon, Rose, guitarists Clint Lowery and John Connolly and bassist Vince Hornsby — got together to work on material at a 300-acre farm inherited by Witherspoon’s wife. It was a great way to bond again, after the pandemic had kept the band members apart – save for several livestream performances — for much of that period. The band set up in the newly renovated two-bedroom house on the property, and with no visitors other than family and little to do anywhere near the farm besides music, it proved to be a comfortable setting where the band could focus on the task at hand and have a great time in the process. “The energy, it was magic,” Witherspoon said. “It was fun to wake up and do a big breakfast thing and hang out and then just jam past dinner, you know, grill outside. You could put fireworks up. I’ve got tons of crazy fireworks out there in the garage, just having a good time, being brothers the way we are. It was more intimate, really, really close. “We were there to do a job and that was what we were able to do, and it was just (fun) to be in that setting,” he said. “We cooked dinner every night, man. Maybe we ordered a pizza one night, but other than that (we cooked), it was fun. We’d go to the grocery store. We’re cooking spaghetti tonight, we’re having steak tonight. We’re grilling out, listening to music outside, watching the sun set. Then going back in and listening to some more music before we go to bed and then waking up the next day early and doing our same schedule, we were working maybe from 11 to 11, or to whenever we felt like stopping.” After wrapping that session, more writing continued until Sevendust headed to Orlando, Florida to record with Michael “Elvis” Baskette, who also produced the band’s previous two albums, 2018’s “All I See Is War” and 2020’s “Blood & Stone.” Being back at Baskette’s studio provided another setting that stoked creativity “We were in the big house, the big mansion house,” Witherspoon said of Baskette’s Barbarosa studio. “Good God, it’s a beautiful mansion with an indoor pool and stuff in there. “When you get there, it’s amazing. You know immediately why you’re there,” he said. You cannot (get away) from the reason this is a music magic house.” Beyond the physical surroundings, the chemistry the band has built with Baskette added to the experience. “I think Elvis is incredible. His ideas are incredible. Everything he comes up with, anything he’s suggesting, is just amazing,” the singer elaborated. “He’s just very laid back and letting us do what we’re going to do. It always comes easy with him. It’s never like ‘Oh, (expletive)!’ or under pressure or I feel stressed out, or I can’t sleep because I’ve got to do vocals tomorrow. It’s never like that. I’m so excited about getting in the booth (to do vocals).” Witherspoon, who said he feels “Truth Killer” flows nicely and shows the growth and maturity of Sevendust, has good reason to feel proud of the latest album. Like “Blood & Stone,"" the new album continues to showcase the melodic side of Sevendust while retaining the crushing riffs and heavy beats that have always characterized the band’s sound. Songs like “Love and Hate,” “Won’t Stop The Bleeding” and the title track pair thick guitar riffs with big vocal melodies, especially in the choruses. Fans of the heavier side of the band will likely be drawn to “Fences,” whose furious tempo and choppy guitar riffs push the song toward punk, and the grinding “No Revolution.” The band also makes more prominent use of sequencers, programmed rhythms and other synthetic/electronic sounds, which makes for a cool blend of traditional instrumentation and computer-generated sounds. Witherspoon said this sonic hybrid, which is particularly pronounced on “I Might Let The Devil Win” (a real twist for Sevendust with its simmering and soft textures), and rockers like “Everything,” “Superficial Drug” and “Holy Water,” was very intentional. “It’s something that we definitely wanted to do,” he said. “Cliff came in, doing a lot of those sequencers and stuff like that, which was incredible to be around and to hear and to see. ‘Let’s try this, yeah, we like this’ and everybody would agree on ‘Yeah, that sounds cool. Let’s try it. Let’s go for it.’ It was definitely something we’ve always behind the scene done and talked about, so it was really cool to be able to finally have the time to say hey, we’re doing this. Let’s go for it.” Witherspoon said the band will be playing several songs from “Truth Killer” on the tour, with the current single “Everything” and “Fences” being among the tracks featured in the show. “We’re going to be really banging out a lot of the new songs,” Witherspoon said. “It’s a lot of the new stuff we’re trying to put out there so people can (discover it). We’ve been gone for so long, with the pandemic and everything, and it’s amazing to have the opportunity to play a new album. Of course, we’ll have stuff in there that the nostalgic (long-time fans) will love to hear.” When: 6:30 p.m. Feb. 16 Where: The Palladium, 261 Main St., Worcester How much: Sold out'}]"

A tree service professional who aims to improve tree health. An arborist is also a tree specialist who performs tree pruning, tree removal and tree trimming, hence the name “Arborist”. Some states have specific requirements on where tree care professionals can obtain their license. Others do not. In the United States, tree care technicians and arborists must be licensed by the local state board. What does an arborist do? Trees are categorized into different types, with different purposes. A tree service arborist may specialize in a certain tree, such as a tree service tree surgeon or tree service provider, depending on his experience and expertise. An arborist is trained to handle a variety of tree-related services like tree removal, tree trimming and tree care, depending on the type of tree. Tree removal – the act of removing dead or dying trees from a landscape. This is an essential service, as it ensures the safety of people and property. If trees fall at a certain rate, more power needs to be applied to the ground to push them out. This could be achieved with a stump remover, tree auger, or other cutting equipment. It’s important to get professional advice if using any of these tools. Tree trimming – this is another service offered by an arborist. They cut down spiky trees and prune certain trees to make them look neat and tidy. There are many techniques used to achieve this goal. Some tree care experts choose hybrid species for instance, which can grow at a fast pace and adapt to a controlled environment. This can cut costs for tree care companies, as they won’t have to buy expensive seeds or plants to start off with tree care. As mentioned earlier, tree care in itself involves many tasks. However, tree trimming is one of them. Arborists have to do a lot of research to figure out what kind of tree is present in a particular region. The kind of tree also dictates the kind of tree trimming services that they can perform. A tree removal can be a painful, dangerous and time consuming task.

doing her part in the preservation and creation of arts and culture space in the City of Boston by penning a letter to the Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA) describing the need for arts and culture space to be included in the draft zoning text amendment associated with the Squares + Streets initiative. According to the BPDA’s website, Squares + Streets is “a new planning and zoning initiative that will focus on housing, public space, small businesses, arts and culture, and transportation in neighborhood centers and along main streets.” As part of the initiative, the BPDA is crafting a zoning text amendment to update zoning in order to “guide development that encourages a mix of building uses and heights, creates housing diversity and growth opportunities, and encourages active streets,” per the BPDA’s website. Specifically, Coletta has asked that the BPDA “include language in this text amendment that requires redevelopments to reprovision any existing arts or cultural space onsite or provide an equal financial contribution for the development of new arts and cultural space.” Coletta voiced fears about losing this type of space in her letter, writing, “I remain concerned about the ongoing loss of arts and culture space throughout the City of Boston.” “Last year, I heard from many of my constituents who were struggling to find music rehearsal space or were actively being evicted from a former arts space,” she added. In her letter, Coletta cites Boston Creates, an analysis from the Mayor’s Office of Arts and Culture (MOAC), which illustrated “a need for new affordable cultural spaces and facilities, and difficulties in meeting the costs of and maintaining existing spaces and facilities.” As well as “an acute and increasing lack of affordable housing and work space for Boston artists, and significant imbalances and gaps in funding for Boston artists and arts and culture organizations,” per Coletta’s letter. Further, Coletta co-signed recommendations made in a letter from the MOAC to the BPDA, which can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lKOxlBPkNPRjX9TmLrKr6lbt_o57k_uFIQSvBC2Vq_w/edit. Several recommendations were made in the MOAC letter, and the letter also speaks to the office’s goal of not seeing a “net loss of cultural space” in the city. “This means that any cultural space that is under threat needs to be secured or re-provided and that new cultural space should be created to make up for past spaces lost. Boston is well positioned to act on this goal through the Squares + Streets planning processes,” reads the MOAC letter. Later in her letter, Coletta points to the debilitating effects of the COVID pandemic on artists in that it became increasingly difficult to pay for workspaces and that other spaces were shut down. She even cites a statistic from Chief of Arts and Culture Kara Elliott-Ortega, that “over 100,000 sq. ft of cultural production space, such as studios and rehearsal spaces, have been lost over the last five to seven years, along with numerous live music venues, gathering spaces and specialist retail.” It should be noted that the BPDA revealed some updates to its zoning text amendment at a public meeting on Tuesday and made some changes in response to conversations and a letter from the MOAC. These updates include making art galleries a type of retail store, allowing incidental sales in art studios, adding an extra small entertainment/events category for up to 250 people, and not including art exhibits with nudity in the adult entertainment category.

'2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'WASHINGTON ― The recession that many economists predicted hasn\'t happened. Consumer confidence is surging. The stock market has soared to all-time highs. And on Friday came a robust jobs report, with the U.S. economy adding 353,000 jobs in January, according to the Labor Department − nearly twice what was projected. President Joe Biden\'s struggle to convince Americans of an improving economy amid stubborn inflation was long considered one of his biggest liabilities as he seeks reelection this fall, likely in a rematch against Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. Yet the repeated good news on the economic front − capped by Friday\'s blockbuster jobs report − suggests the tide could be turning, potentially making the economy a strength for Biden by the time of the November election. ""The economy is about as good as it gets,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\'s Analytics, adding that even the one blemish − inflation that is ""still stinging"" − is becoming less painful. ""I think with each passing month, his case will strengthen,"" Zandi said of Biden, ""and people\'s perceptions will align more with his message."" The economy has long been a weakness for Biden in polls, with surveys showing disapproval among Americans about his handling of it. Part of the reason for that has been a starkly uneven recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic. Wealthier households have reaped more of the benefits of the economic improvement. Meanwhile, middle-class and low-income Americans have suffered the brunt of the pain from higher prices for groceries and other goods. And high student debt burdens and climbing housing prices have combined to reinforce the economic anxiety for many households. But January\'s jobs gains shattered economists\' projections that 185,000 jobs were added last month. The unemployment rate held steady at a low 3.7%, marking 24 months of unemployment below 4%, the longest streak since the 1960s. The U.S. economy has now added 14.8 million jobs since Biden took office − a gain of 5.4 million more jobs than before the Covid-19 pandemic. ""America’s economy is the strongest in the world. Today, we saw more proof,"" Biden said in a statement. More: Donald Trump says he hopes economy tanks this election year \'because I don\'t want to be Herbert Hoover\' Even Larry Kudlow, former director of the National Economic Council in the Trump administration, called it ""a blowout"" jobs report, despite Republicans\' continued criticism on Biden over the economy. ""I know many of my conservative friends are trying to drill holes in this report,"" Kudlow said on Fox News. ""But you know what, folks? It is what it is. It\'s a very strong report. Not every economic stat should be viewed through a political lens."" The U.S. gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S., expanded by 2.5% last year, more than any advanced economy in the world last year, according to an International Monetary Fund analysis released this week. The U.S. economy is expected to grow faster than all other nations this year as well. Meanwhile, the stock market has been on a steady rise for months, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average eclipsing 38,000 for the first time ever. It\'s so strong that Trump − who predicted a market collapse if Biden won the 2020 election − now wants credit, telling his supporters this week that the hot stock market is the result of investors predicting a Trump victory in the fall. White House spokesman Andrew Bates mocked Trump in response, saying ""we welcome the wide range of ideologically diverse voices conceding that President Biden is delivering an economy that actually delivers for hardworking families − not just billionaires or executives in multinational corporations."" The improving economic trends aren\'t entirely new. For the past year, the White House has sought credit for a robust jobs market and growing economy, dubbing Biden\'s economic agenda ""Bidenomics."" But Biden has been unable to calm economic anxieties because of primarily one reason: high inflation. Although inflation has slowed significantly since reaching a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, it has been a winding path downward. Consumer prices edged up to 3.4% in December compared to a year ago, up from 3.1% in November. The cost of services such as rent, car repairs and auto insurance have moved higher. But there are new signs that Americans are becoming less concerned about inflation. Consumer sentiment has climbed 29% over the past two months, the largest two-month increase since 1991, according to the University of Michigan\'s frequently cited survey of consumers. It\'s the result largely of an improved outlook over inflation and personal finances. The consumer confidence index is now 60% higher than the all-time low measured in June 2022 and at its highest level since July 2021. ""It\'s rare to see this level of agreement across the population and across different aspects of the economy,"" said Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan\'s consumer index survey. She said consumers were reserving judgment in the fall whether the inflation slowdown would stick. ""Now with so many months of sustained slowdown in inflation, I think consumers are finally starting to feel assured. They are ready to take a breath."" A Quinnipiac University poll this week found Biden leading Trump 50%-44% nationally among registered voters, expanding what was a 1-point Biden lead by the same pollster in December. Importantly, it found Biden leading independent voters who will be crucial in deciding the 2024 election 52%-40%. A majority of voters, 55%, said they disapprove of Biden\'s handling of the economy, compared to 42% who said they approve. Yet it marked a slight improvement from Quinnipiac\'s December poll, which found only 39% approved of Biden\'s handling of the economy. ""Things are finally beginning to sink in,"" Biden, reflecting on the surge in consumer confidence, said during a stop last week in Superior, Wisconsin. ""We passed a lot of really good legislation. We knew it was going to take time for it to begin to take hold. But it\'s taken hold now and turning the economy around."" Still, consumer sentiment remains 7% below the historic average, according to the University of Michigan survey, suggesting many Americans still want to see lasting economic improvements before their anxiety eases. And with the exception of the Quinnipiac poll, Biden still trails Trump in the majority of head-to-head polls and in several key battleground states. Nevertheless, Moody\'s Analytics projected a narrow Biden victory over Trump in its presidential election model released Thursday. The forecast is based on economic conditions of the country that are historically key election indicators − such as gas prices, household income, mortgage rates and consumer confidence − in addition to political factors. ""Biden has an advantage because he has the economy at his back,"" Zandi said. ""There\'s an economic tailwind to his reelection bid. If everything sticks to our script, it will only intensify as we approach the election. The economy is going to continue to perform well. And by Election Day, I think that will resonate more soundly with with voters."" Reach Joey Garrison on X, formerly Twitter, @joeygarrison.'}]"

'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'By Catherine Carlock, The Boston Globe MORRISVILLE, N.C. — Ten minutes from the Raleigh airport, the future of biotech is under construction. On either side of a new stretch of four-lane highway sit two $1 billion biomanufacturing campuses, which will bring a combined 2.5 million square feet of research and development and advanced manufacturing space to a region that has become the No. 1 place where North America makes prescription drugs. One campus, called Pathway Triangle, is being built by a developer from Boston, King Street Properties. King Street — which has projects in Cambridge, Waltham, Allston, and Lexington — is building a similarly vast biomanufacturing campus in Devens. But these days it also sees a land of opportunity 700 miles to the south, in North Carolina. And King Street isn’t alone. Most of the major real estate players in Greater Boston’s life-science world either have a presence in North Carolina’s Research Triangle area or are considering one. They have to. It’s where their tenants are looking to grow. “You’ve got the global names,” said Chris Rouches, a King Street managing director. “The market has something these companies want.” Maintaining Massachusetts’ competitive edge is top of mind these days for political and business leaders alike. And, to be clear, few places on the planet compare to Greater Boston’s drugmaking expertise. But the life science industry isn’t just about researchers with PhDs. New drugs have to be physically produced somewhere, too. And while biotech has become the crown jewel of Greater Boston’s economy, other parts of the country are eager to pluck a few of those gems for themselves. One place especially well positioned to do so: Raleigh. It too has elite universities and a talented workforce. But it also has expansive land, flexible permitting, and — crucially for large-scale manufacturing — lower costs to do business. Electric rates for industrial users in North Carolina are less than half those in Massachusetts, according to federal data. Construction workers here earn on average $47 per hour, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. In North Carolina? $33. And housing prices? Nowhere near the stratosphere of Boston. All these factors make it a very appealing place for drugmakers who want to open a plant in the United States but keep their costs in check, said Mark M. Sweeney, a longtime site selection expert in South Carolina. “You can do onshoring and locate a facility in a high-quality location around Raleigh-Durham,” he said. “And almost every major factor is going to be less expensive than Boston.” Demand for biomanufacturing — the making of materials used in medicines and other products — is growing fast. Third-party manufacturers have long waitlists, and many drug companies are bringing biomanufacturing back to the United States to speed and simplify product development. Massachusetts has benefitted too. At least 10 biotech plants have recently expanded or are under construction here. Today, twice as many people work in biomanufacturing in Greater Boston as do around Raleigh, according to real estate firm JLL. But JLL expects the business will grow faster in Raleigh, and recently ranked it — not Boston — as the No. 1 biomanufacturing market in the country. Each of these expansive and expensive facilities can create hundreds of jobs — not so much for scientists with PhDs as for workers with technical degrees and experience. And that’s the core of North Carolina’s workforce. Raleigh-Durham also has top-tier universities — Duke University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, N.C. State — where spinouts have fostered a growing cluster of research and development. Add abundant land, a growing talent base, and “an increasingly favorable business environment,” and “Raleigh-Durham is uniquely positioned to meet the need” of drug developers, the JLL report states. That’s drawing big players. The Japanese conglomerate Fujifilm may be best known for its cameras, but it’s also a major contract drugmaker. It has an 80,000-square-foot “collaboration center” in Cambridge and a smaller space in Watertown, but it’s now building a $2 billion manufacturing facility in Holly Springs, about 25 minutes south of Raleigh airport. The campus is reached by a nondescript two-lane road lined with tall trees and small local businesses — an auto-body shop, a gymnastics gym, a brewery. But at nearly 2 million square feet, it will be North America’s largest contract drug factory and has already attracted its first occupant: Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen Supply Group. The facility itself is across from a 687-acre master-planned community, with homes, restaurants, a golf course, and tennis and pickleball courts. On a recent sunny day in Holly Springs, heavy machinery trod the red clay soil of the North Carolina Piedmont. Massive gray concrete boxes — about three stories high and as long as multiple football fields — that will eventually hold sophisticated manufacturing facilities stand already built. Fujifilm is one of several big biotech companies that have moved to Holly Springs, a growing town about a half hour from the 7,000-acre Research Triangle Park. When the corporation announced its decision to locate there in 2021, its officials touted a “rigorous data-driven evaluation process.” Fujifilm’s existing facilities in nearby Morrisville and the region’s strong pool of technical talent were big factors, the company said. It probably didn’t hurt that Raleigh-Durham is a less expensive place to operate than other established life science hubs such as Boston, San Francisco, and New Jersey. Cost tends to be a bigger factor for companies deciding on locations for big manufacturing facilities than for headquarters or high-end research operations, where they may prioritize access to talent. But there, too, Sweeney warned, Greater Boston’s advantage could erode. “The economic development community there would be wise to recognize that there is a threat to even that part of the business with the Raleigh-Durham area,” he said. There also tends to be a clearer picture in North Carolina of what can be built, and when. Permitting even a small project in Greater Boston can take months. By contrast, getting approvals for a modest interior fitout at one of King Street’s Morrisville projects took just a few weeks, Rouches said. Local economic development operators are easy to deal with, he said, and listen to what private industry needs. “There’s still room to grow,” he said. “And they’re jumping on it very eagerly.” Massachusetts has its success stories too. King Street’s 45-acre Pathway Devens project has landed several major tenants, in large part because the town and quasi-public agency MassDevelopment, which oversees redeveloping the old Fort Devens army base, took steps to smooth complex permitting. Across the street from Pathway, Bristol-Myers Squibb operates an 89-acre campus, and in June it received approval to expand. Experts agree there’s opportunity in both markets. Greater Boston is unmatched in its concentration of universities and their track record in spinning research out into new companies and patents. Education remains the region’s sharpest advantage. But North Carolina has education strengths, too, particularly when it comes to training blue-collar workers for highly skilled jobs — exactly what biomanufacturing facilities are looking for. Massachusetts is working on this, too, with new apprenticeships and training programs. But North Carolina has taken it to another level. In 2022, Wake Technical Community College and Durham Technical Community College launched RTP Bio, a workforce development partnership with big-name drugmakers. On Wake Tech’s RTP campus sits a gleaming new Lilly Science and Technology Center, full of technical equipment and products to train tomorrow’s workforce. Amgen, too, has a lab outfitted with its own equipment to train future employees for a facility that isn’t even open yet. During a tour of the facility, the presidents of Wake and Durham Tech look through a set of big windows and point.

Thursday, Feb. 8 at 1 p.m. MST (3 p.m. EST). Did the Phoenix Suns make any moves before the deadline? Take a look back at our updates from the deadline involving the team, which included a lot of speculation surrounding the Charlotte Hornets\' Miles Bridges as well as the Brooklyn Nets\' Royce O\'Neale. Spoiler alert: The team ended up trading for one of those players. Did the team miss out by not treading for any other potential targets? How will the players the team traded for help the team? Is Phoenix better now that it was before the deadline? The Suns announced the deal on Thursday afternoon, making it official. The Phoenix Suns acquired forward Royce O’Neale from the Brooklyn Nets and forward David Roddy from the Memphis Grizzlies in the three-team trade. As part of the deal, the Suns sent forward Keita Bates-Diop, guard Jordan Goodwin and three future second-round picks to the Nets, and forward/center Chimezie Metu, forward Yuta Watanabe and a 2026 first-round pick swap to the Grizzlies. “Royce and David both bring a competitive mindset and defensive intensity that improves our team as we continue our drive to win an NBA Championship,” said James Jones, Suns President of Basketball Operations and General Manager. “Royce is a very intelligent and disruptive defender, capable of guarding multiple positions, also adding significant playoff experience and reliable three-point shooting to our roster. David possesses exceptional strength and physicality, bringing energy whenever he steps on the court.” Phoenix Suns trade grades: Royce O\'Neale, David Roddy deal \'huge win\' at NBA trade deadline On ESPN\'s NBA Today trade deadline special, Bob Myers said: ""That move gives Phoenix exactly what they needed. They do not need any more scoring. They needed perimeter defense."" ""That move gives Phoenix exactly what they needed. They do not need any more scoring.

But he can still get up and make threes and rumble with opposing 2s, 3s and 4s—a body of work that gives him member-of-the-closing-unit potential. Lament the inclusion of so many second-rounders if you must. The Suns have Devin Booker, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal. Grabbing someone who can rank as one of their five to seven most dependable rotation players is more valuable than mystery-box picks outside the first round.""

Phoenix made a quietly good move for Nets forward Royce O’Neale, who has been in some big-time playoff battles with Durant and rounds out the bench. O’Neale is a versatile defender and his three-point percentages should normalize. All the Suns had to give up was a package of second-round picks. The Nets could’ve done more shopping and gotten a better deal but I guess they still feel some love towards Durant and wanted to help him out.""

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:21 pm Feelings of pain and outrage, hopelessness, confusion, frustration, sadness, a sense of betrayal, unsafety and fear were all voiced in the conversations among roughly 60 residents who took two hours out of their Sunday afternoon to gather at Pierce Middle School auditorium on Feb. 4. The residents from diverse backgrounds came to talk freely and address the question of how can the community “dwell together in peace” in light of the continuing war in Gaza and surrounding territories. Milton Interfaith Clergy Association (MICA) organized the event at the request of the Select Board after strong feelings emerged last year after the Oct. 7 bombings in Israel by Hamas. The Select Board issued a statement in support of Israel after the attacks and the taking of hostages and agreed to hang the Israeli flag from the town’s gazebo. A group of diverse residents calling themselves Milton Neighbors in Favor of Palestinian Rights, then requested a Palestinian flag be hung beside the Israeli flag, possibly with a peace flag between them, as a commitment to both groups and to peace. Many residents came forward to express strong emotions at board meetings and no more flags were flown. The board members agreed that the town needed a positive forum to explore the topic in depth. Those attending on Feb. 4 were asked to divide into eight groups, each with a facilitator to tackle three questions of what dominant emotions they have been experiencing, what they understand about the situation, and finally “How do we dwell in peace here in Milton? What steps might you take?” “I am always touched by the way people want to talk with each other,” said Rev. Lisa Ward, MICA president, as she walked among the small groups who filled the auditorium with a hum of voices. For more on this story in print or online. Log In Keep it Clean.

Maura Healey on Wednesday nominated an appeals court judge and former romantic partner, with whom she shared a home for several years, to an open seat on the state’s highest court. Massachusetts Appeals Court Associate Justice Gabrielle R. Wolohojian would serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Judicial Court if her nomination is approved. Wolohojian is Healey’s second nomination to the state’s highest court. “There is no one more qualified or better prepared to serve on the Supreme Judicial Court than Justice Wolohojian. She will bring over three decades of broad trial and appellate experience, including sixteen years on the Appeals Court,” Healey said in a press release. “Justice Wolohojian has served on the Appeals Court with distinction and her work is widely respected by members of the bench and bar. She has an exceptional understanding of the law and a strong commitment to the administration of justice,” Healey added. Wolohojian, 63, would fill the seat vacated by Justice David Lowy. Last year Healey nominated then-state solicitor Elizabeth Dewar to the high court. Wolohojian was appointed to the Appeals Court in February 2008 and has authored more than 900 decisions, according to Healey’s office. She has also served as the chair of the Supreme Judicial Court’s Advisory Committee on the Rules of Appellate Procedure. Healey and Wolohojian, who met when they both worked at the Boston law firm of Hale & Dorr, had been together for eight years when Healey began her first term as attorney general in 2015, according to a Boston Magazine profile. Wolohojian and Healey had lived together in a rowhouse in the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston that also served as a campaign headquarters for Healey. Wolohojian did not play a public role in the campaign. The governor now lives with her current partner, Joanna Lydgate, in Arlington. Healey’s office did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment from the governor but said she would address reporters later Wednesday. Wolohojian must go before the eight-member Governor’s Council charged with reviewing and approving judicial nominations. The Supreme Judicial Court is Massachusetts’s highest appellate court. The seven justices hear appeals on a range of criminal and civil cases. Born in New York, and the granddaughter of Armenian immigrants, Justice Wolohojian received a bachelor’s degree, magna cum laude, from Rutgers University in 1982; a doctorate in English language and literature from the University of Oxford in 1987; and a Juris Doctor from Columbia Law School in 1989. Healey’s office also described Wolohojian as an accomplished violinist, who regularly performs with orchestras, including the Boston Civic Symphony orchestra. ©2024 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC Stay up to date with everything Boston.

With more than 6,300 individuals in New England currently waiting for a life-saving organ transplant, Mayor Patrick M. Keefe Jr. has declared February 14, “Have a Heart & Give a Heart Day,” in recognition of those touched by organ and tissue donors citywide. On February 9, New England Donor Services, in collaboration with the Mayor’s Office, will be joined by four local donors and their organ recipients, in celebration of this event. Mayor Keefe, who, in the past, donated his left kidney to his mother, noted: “You have the opportunity to change the outcome of someone’s life with a selfless act. Choose to make that outcome a positive one.” The Mayor also added, “Give the gift of life by choosing to be a donor.” This observance honors those who have already chosen to Donate Life, while encouraging others to get the organ donor “heart” on their Driver’s License/ID through the Registry of Motor Vehicles.

Valentine’s Day Fire Safety Tips Keep fire safety in mind this Valentine’s Day to safely maintain the spark of a romantic evening. According to the National Fire Protection Association® (NFPA®), that means keeping a close eye on what’s cooking on the stove or in the oven and practicing caution when using candles. “For anyone planning to celebrate Valentine’s Day at home this year, there’s a good chance those plans will include a special meal and glowing candles,” said Lorraine Carli, vice president of Outreach and Advocacy at NFPA. “Our goal is to make sure these romantic gestures are done with fire safety in mind.” Cooking is by far the leading cause of U.S. home fires with nearly half (49 percent) of all home fires involving cooking equipment. Unattended cooking is the leading cause of cooking fires and half of all cooking fire deaths. “Keeping a close eye on what’s cooking can be a challenge, particularly on special occasions like Valentine’s Day when you’re trying to get everything just right,” said Carli. “But when you consider that unattended cooking is the leading cause of cooking fires, it’s clear that carefully monitoring what’s on the stove and in the oven is critical to ensuring a fire-safe evening.” Candles, which also represent a leading cause of home fires, need to be used with caution. NFPA data shows that half of all candle fires started when a flammable object – such as furniture, bedding, curtains, home decorations, or clothing – was too close to a lit candle. In 21 percent of home candle fires, the candle was either left unattended, discarded, or otherwise misused. Over one-third of candle fires (36 percent) started in the bedroom. Carli recommends using flameless or battery-operated candles, which provide a similar look and feel to open-flame candles while eliminating the risk of associated fires. If you do plan to use real candles, following are tips from NFPA to do so safely: • Avoid using candles in the bedroom and other areas where people may fall asleep. • Place candles on sturdy, uncluttered surfaces where they will not be knocked over. • Use caution when lighting candles. Keep hair and any loose clothing away from the flame. • Do not allow candles to burn down too close to the base of the holder or container. • Never leave a child alone in the presence of a burning candle. • Keep matches and lighters out of children’s reach.

In addition, NFPA encourages the public to make sure they have working smoke alarms and to develop and practice a home escape plan. Your email address will not be published.

docked off of Water Street. Officials say the fire resulted from sparks that flew from a metal saw as the boat was being decommissioned. Fairhaven Fire Chief Todd Correia said the fire on the boat named ""Carrabassett"" was reported around 6:58 a.m. ""They tried to contain it with a fire extinguisher at first and then they called 9-1-1,"" Correia said. ""So there was a slight delay with us being notified."" Correia said the fire was sizable by the time crews arrived on scene. It took firefighters about an hour to extinguish the flames using a combination of water and environmentally-safe foam, Correia said. As of about 10 a.m. Thursday, Correia said Mass. Department of Environmental Protection, U.S. Coast Guard, and a private cleanup company were on scene to ensure the environment was kept safe. On scene, Fairhaven Harbormaster Timothy Cox said Global Remediation Services were in the process of pumping any remaining fluids from the boat. ""It\'s a good thing there was no fuel, the motor had been taken out,"" Cox said. According to Cox, the owners\' intent was to have the decommissioned Carrabassett converted into an artificial reef that would assist marine life. ""What they do is take everything off a decommissioned boat, make sure there\'s no pollutants, then take it out to sea and sink it, and it becomes a reef for the fish,"" he explained. A worker on scene confirmed the boat was owned by BASE Seafood. Correia noted New Bedford and Mattapoisett firefighters provided mutual aid on scene while Acushnet provided station coverage. A 2021 report in the Provincetown Banner when the vessel was grounded in Cape Cod waters, states the Carrabassett was previously named ""Cowboy"" and was part of a fleet that belonged to ""The Codfather,"" Carlos Rafael until it was sold to Blue Harvest Fisheries in 2020. It was since purchased by C&P Trawlers in a bankruptcy auction on Nov. 6, 2023 as part of a $12 million deal, according to reports. C&P Trawlers LLC was formed in part by Cassie Canastra, according to reports, who is director of operations for BASE. A staff member who answered the phone at BASE Thursday morning said no one would be available to confirm any information on the boat. The Standard-Times could not locate contact information for C&P Trawlers, but a business listings website lists its address as 62 Hassey St., New Bedford -- the same address as BASE.'}]"

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Saturday, June 1, 2024 On Dec. 7, 2023, a hit-and-run crash took place on Totten Paul Road in Waltham. This accident caused the deaths of National Grid employee Roderick Jackson and Waltham police officer Paul Tracey. The man charged with this crime is 54-year-old Peter Simon from Woodsville, New Hampshire. He drove onto the worksite, between a National Grid truck and a backhoe, and drove straight into the trench where Tracey was directing traffic and Jackson was working. Multiple other National Grid workers were injured. Simon struck multiple vehicles, in addition to Jackson and Tracey, before abandoning his pickup truck. Upon stepping out of his truck, Simon was confronted by an officer who had been called to the scene.He pulled a knife on the officer and proceeded to steal his cruiser. Simon then crashed the police vehicle before leading more responding officers on a chase on foot. He was eventually arrested. Simon faced 15 charges for his actions on Dec. 7. These charges included, two counts of manslaughter, two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon, negligent operation of a motor vehicle, armed robbery, leaving the scene of an accident after causing personal injury and death, unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, two counts of leaving the scene of an accident after causing property damage, larceny of a motor vehicle, marked lanes violations and failure to stop. The court ruled to hold him without bail while he presented a plea of not guilty. Simon then faced a dangerousness hearing on Jan. 25 in which his defense requested that he be released to home confinement with GPS monitoring. The reason was that Simon’s significant mental health needs could not be met in jail. The judge decided against this request, agreeing with the commonwealth that Simon needed to be held in custody. In an article by WCVB, Waltham Police Chief Kevin O’Connell stated, “I think the Commonwealth proved today that beyond a reasonable doubt that he’s a dangerous person and shouldn’t be out on the street right now waiting trial.” During this trial, Simon’s past criminal record was investigated and presented to the judge. In 2009 he caused a very dangerous and almost fatal vehicle crash, from which the victims suffered lifelong injuries, including total facial and jaw reconstruction surgery. Simon fled from police officers, who had fired several shots at him. Simon pleaded not guilty by reason of mental illness. He struggles with substance abuse and has been diagnosed with dissociative disorder. Following his trial for his 2009 incident, Simon was committed to a secure psychiatric facility in prison before being officially transferred to the New Hampshire State Hospital and released in 2015 after therapy and medication. A police report filed in 2016, stated that Simon threatened to kill a man by wrapping a power cord around his neck and stating “You’re gonna die now.” He also threatened to kill this man’s wife. When trying to flee, Simon smashed his vehicle into a fence. The following year he pled guilty to second degree assault, criminal threatening, disobeying an officer and an aggravated DUI. Simon’s next hearing is scheduled for Feb. 29. Waltham Police Officer Paul Tracey served with the department for 28 years. Tracey received an outpouring of support from the entire Waltham and first responder communities. A wake with fireworks, mass, and a large funeral were held in his honor. On Dec. 15, 2023, hundreds of officers joined the Waltham community for a service at Our Lady Comforter of the Afflicted Church. Waltham schools were closed for Tracey’s funeral. He was buried at the Mount Feake Cemetery with police honors. Tracey was born and raised in Waltham and is survived by his wife and children in the same town. Roderick Jackson, gas operations technician at National Grid also had a funeral full of remembrance following the accident. Jackson was an athlete who had helped raise his three younger siblings. His family has stated that they plan to sue Simon for taking Jackson’s life. Jackson’s family has also stated that they have plans to create a scholarship in his honor.

A mix-up at a U.S. base in Jordan may have allowed an exploding drone to elude defenses, killing three soldiers and injuring at least 40 early Sunday in an attack American and NATO officials are blaming on Iran. The hostile drone apparently was mistaken for a U.S. drone that was in the area at the same time, letting it get through and detonate, according to initial assessments cited Monday by two U.S. officials who spoke to USA TODAY. Top U.S. and NATO officials dismissed Iran's assertion that it had no role in the deadly assault, which threatened to fuel the expansion of the Israeli-Hamas war. 👉 Everything we know about the strike. Ending a protracted international sports drama that has dragged on for nearly two years, the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Monday morning banned Russian Olympic figure skater Kamila Valieva for four years and said her 2022 Olympic results were disqualified. What happens next? The International Skating Union, the worldwide governing body for figure skating, will now decide the results of the 2022 Olympic team figure skating competition. If Valieva's results are disallowed, the ISU is likely to move the United States up to the gold medal, followed by Japan with silver and fourth-place finisher Canada moving up to win the bronze. ⛸️ What to know about the decision.

On the surface of Venus, it’s extremely hot so there’s pretty much no chance that anything could possibly survive. But in the clouds 40 to 50 kilometers above the surface, it’s approximately Earth’s temperature and pressure. So what is the possibility that there could be microbes floating in the clouds? These clouds, however, are not made up of water, but concentrated sulfuric acid, which previously has been thought to destroy any form of complex organic molecules. We wanted to do a simple, foundational study: could these organic molecules that are the building blocks of life here on Earth be stable in sulfuric acid? And your team’s research, published last year in the science journal PNAS and slated to be published in an upcoming issue of Astrobiology, found that these building blocks of life remained stable? Seager: Yes, for the most part, they remain stable and intact over the span of many months. But that doesn’t automatically prove that life exists on Venus. Seager: As my mom always emphasizes, we’re not looking for life or trying to prove life, but we’re saying that without these simple building blocks, life—our life on Earth—couldn’t exist. Life on Earth needs water (and scientists hypothesize any potential life needs a liquid solvent), so we essentially asked: since the nucleic acid bases and the amino acids remained stable in the same concentrated sulfuric acid that exists in the clouds above Venus, could that life use sulfuric acid as a solvent instead of water? Basically, we want to study whether sulfuric acid might play the same role in supporting life on Venus that water plays in supporting life on Earth. What role is the research going to play in the 2025 mission to Venus? Seager: The first mission will be looking at fluorescence (and backscattered polarized radiation) as a simple test to see if there are complex organic molecules. A probe will get dropped into the atmosphere, and as it falls, we’ll have five minutes or so in the cloud layers to get readings and send them back, then the probe will implode or crash on the surface. That’s the simplest detection method. Eventually the team wants to get a sample return, but that’s far into the future. That’s a lot harder than just sending a little probe. What was it like getting to work with your mom on this? How did it all start? Seager: It’s super fun working with her. When I was a kid, we would be able to play sports together, but once I got older, she was afraid we weren’t going to share any hobbies. Once we started doing research together it was awesome to start to share a new interest we could collaborate on. It started over COVID. We had nothing to do, school was remote and the sports fields were closed down. She initially got me set up just doing some basic research at home—really fundamental research on what sort of building blocks for space vehicles could survive sulfuric acid. Then I started college and started studying biochemistry. My mom doesn’t really have a chemistry background; there are some other people on the team that do, but she told me, “We could use your help on the chemistry side of it,” and then we started on the first project, looking at nucleic acid bases. I did a little bit of work on it, some at home, some interpreting data from the lab at MIT. The amino acids research started last year, when I had broken my arm and didn’t have much to do for a few months, so we started the studies in our makeshift home lab, before transitioning the lab work to MIT, where it is now. What brought you to WPI? Seager: I really liked the project-based learning model at WPI—I’m still enjoying that. It’s the main thing that drew my attention, along with the IQP and MQP programs. I also like the overall STEM foundation here, and the top notch biochemistry program. How have you applied the Venus research experience to your studies at WPI? Seager: The main thing I learned about from working with the Venus team relates to the process of writing and publishing papers—specifically, the rigor of the submission and revision process and just how long it takes to obtain a final, peer-reviewed version of a paper for publication. Additionally, I learned a lot about the technical writing of research papers, and was able to apply some new technical writing skills to a lab report paper I had to write for a biochem lab last term, for example. What’s next for you? Are you starting to think about graduation next year? Seager: I haven’t thought too much about that yet. I’ll be on IQP in Cádiz next term, studying and implementing photocatalytic degradation processes of microplastics in wastewater treatment plants. As far as the research I’m involved with with my mom, we’re continuing with our experiments, expanding our future focus to more complex biomolecules. This summer I’ll be working with our Venus team and professor Destin Heilman, studying proteins and other polymers in sulfuric acid.'}]"

(Kyodo News via AP) By MARI YAMAGUCHI and KEN MORITSUGU (Associated Press)TOKYO (AP) — Seiji Ozawa, the Japanese conductor who amazed audiences with the lithe physicality of his performances during three decades at the helm of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, has died, his management office said Friday. He was 88.The internationally acclaimed maestro, with his trademark mop of salt-and-pepper hair, led the BSO from 1973 to 2002, longer than any other conductor in the orchestra’s history. From 2002 to 2010, he was the music director of the Vienna State Opera.He died of heart failure Tuesday at his home in Tokyo, according to his office, Veroza Japan. He remained active in his later years, particularly in his native land. He was the artistic director and founder of the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival, a music and opera festival in Japan. He and the Saito Kinen Orchestra, which he co-founded in 1984, won the Grammy for best opera recording in 2016 for Ravel’s “L’Enfant et Les Sortileges (The Child and the Spells.)”In 2022, he conducted his Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival for the first time in three years to mark its 30th anniversary. That turned out to be his last public performance. That year, Ozawa also conducted the Saito Kinen Orchestra to deliver Beethoven’s “Egmont” Overture live to Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata at the International Space Station. The event was co-organized with the Japan Aerospace and Exploration Agency, just as the world was divided by the coronavirus pandemic.“Music can link the hearts of people — transcending words, borders, religion, and politics. It is my hope that through music, we can be reminded that we are all of the same human race living on the same planet. And that we are united,” Ozawa said in a statement. Ozawa exerted enormous influence over the BSO during his tenure. He appointed 74 of its 104 musicians and his celebrity attracted famous performers including Yo-Yo Ma and Itzhak Perlman. He also helped the symphony become the biggest-budget orchestra in the world, with an endowment that grew from less than $10 million in the early 1970s to more than $200 million in 2002.When Ozawa conducted the Boston orchestra in 2006 — four years after he had left — he received a hero’s welcome with a nearly six-minute ovation. Ozawa was born Sept. 1, 1935, to Japanese parents in Manchuria, China, while it was under Japanese occupation.After his family returned to Japan in 1944, he studied music under Hideo Saito, a cellist and conductor credited with popularizing Western music in Japan. Ozawa revered him and formed the Saito Kinen (Saito Memorial) Orchestra in 1984 and eight years later founded the Saito Kinen Festival — renamed the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival in 2015. Ozawa first arrived in the United States in 1960 and was quickly hailed by critics as a brilliant young talent. He attended the Tanglewood Music Center and was noticed by Leonard Bernstein, who appointed him assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic for the 1961-62 season. After his New York debut with the Philharmonic at age 25, The New York Times said “the music came brilliantly alive under his direction.”He directed various ensembles including the San Francisco Orchestra and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra before beginning his tenure in Boston in 1970.At the time there were few nonwhite musicians on the international scene. Ozawa embraced the challenge and it became his lifelong passion to help Japanese performers demonstrate they could be first-class musicians. In his 1967 book “The Great Conductors,” critic Harold C. Schonberg noted the changing ranks of younger conductors, writing that Ozawa and Indian-born Zubin Mehta were the first Asian conductors “to impress one as altogether major talents.”Ozawa had considerable star quality and crossover appeal in Boston, where he was a well-known fan of the Red Sox and Patriots sports teams. In 2002, Catherine Peterson, executive director of Arts Boston, a nonprofit group that markets Boston’s arts, told The Associated Press that “for most people in this community, Seiji personifies the Boston Symphony.”Ozawa is largely credited with elevating the Tanglewood Music Center, a music academy in Lenox, Massachusetts, to international prominence. In 1994, a 1,200-seat, $12 million music hall at the center was named for him.His work at Tanglewood was not without controversy. In 1996, as music director of the orchestra and its ultimate authority, he decided to move the respected academy in new directions. Ozawa ousted Leon Fleisher, the longtime director of Tanglewood, and several prominent teachers quit in protest.Despite glowing reviews for his performances in Europe and Japan, American critics were increasingly disappointed in the later years of his tenure with the BSO. In 2002, Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times wrote that Ozawa had become, after a bold start, “an embodiment of the entrenched music director who has lost touch.”Many of the orchestra’s musicians agreed and even circulated an anti-Ozawa newsletter claiming he had worn out his welcome in Boston. But the city, marking his 85th birthday in 2020, announced it designated Sept. 1 as (asterisk)Seiji Ozawa Day.(asterisk)Ozawa won two Emmy awards for TV work with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the first in 1976 for the BSO’s PBS series “Evening at Symphony” and the second in 1994, for Individual Achievement in Cultural Programming, for “Dvorak in Prague: A Celebration.”Ozawa held honorary doctorates of music from the University of Massachusetts, the New England Conservatory of Music, and Wheaton College in Norton, Mass. He was one of five honorees at the annual Kennedy Center Honors in 2015 for contributing to American culture through the arts.In later years, Ozawa’s health deteriorated. He canceled some appearances in 2015-16 for health reasons, including what would have been his first return to the Tanglewood music festival — the summer home of the Boston symphony — in a decade. Messages of condolence poured in from around the world, including orchestras in Vienna and Berlin, musicians and residents of Matsumoto. “The Boston Symphony Orchestra remembers Maestro Ozawa not only as a legendary conductor, but also as a passionate mentor for future generations of musicians, generously offering his time to education and master classes,” the symphony said in a statement. Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra Chairman Daniel Froschauer said in his comment posted on X, formerly Twitter, that Ozawa “has left'}]"

sleet and the darkness of 6:00 pm in January, some 40-plus people attended the public meeting held by Mattapoisett’s Holy Ghost Grounds Reuse Committee. The committee chair had used local print media and social media to get the word out that their attendance would help the town plan the future of the 7-acre public land. Chairman Mike Rosa, along with volunteers Nathan Ketchel (Planning Board member and committee vice chairman), Freemin Bauer, Nicky Miller, Jack Hill, Denise Conton (clerk), Greta Fox (Recreation Department director) and Aaron Goldberg, had been charged by the Select Board to gather community input and ideas on how the town should use the parcel. Before getting into the data details, Rosa gave a brief historical retrospective of the property, noting the 1943 ownership by the Holy Ghost Society, 2016 purchase by the YMCA and the town’s acquisition in 2016. Rosa further noted that future plans include the passage of the bike path through the grounds along the railroad easement where restrooms have been restored and made ADA compliant (handicapped accessible.) He also clarified that there is currently no budget for work at the property. A look at the 10-year capital plan does not list any projects on the site. The chairman also made it clear that this committee would not be making decisions or offering opinions regarding possible uses. He pointed out the committee’s duties as: identifying a range of potential uses through public input, holding public information session(s) and finally preparing a report for the Select Board to review. A survey that generated some 550 responses (primarily from full or part-time residents) was held between August and September. The survey gauged respondents’ positive or negative views on different activities, resulting in a healthy response from a wide range of age groups. A dog park and pickleball courts received high positive scores. However, balancing out that number was a nearly equal amount against those purposes. Positively favored activities that did not illicit negative pushback were a playground, picnic area and walking loop, among others. Attendees thought it might be best to think about passive activities such as a picnic area or playground before considering others which might cause conflict or high expense.

random questions answered by Harvard experts. “Because of its strategic location, the size of its land mass, its environmental impact, we’re not going to be able to avoid dealing with Russia,” said former White House Russia expert Fiona Hill (center). Niles Singer/Harvard Staff Photographer Liz Mineo Harvard Staff Writer As the two-year-old war in Ukraine continues with no end in sight, Russian President Vladimir Putin is feeling the heat with his country’s economy under strain and an estimated hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers dead or injured. “The war has damaged Putin,” said former White House Russia expert Fiona Hill. “The more this drags on, the less beneficial it is for Putin.” The senior fellow at the Brookings Institute Center on the United States and Europe Hill offered her assessments on the war’s prospects, Putin’s political future, and Russia’s geopolitical importance during a talk Tuesday afternoon, sponsored by the Belfer Center and Russia Matters at Harvard Kennedy School. Putin remains committed to winning the war, launched in February 2022, because it could bolster his chances to stay in power, she said. Putin, who became Russia’s president in 2000, passed a law in 2021 that would allow him to remain in power until 2036. “The end game for Putin is Ukraine’s capitulation,” said Hill. Hill, A.M. ’91, Ph.D. ’98, served as national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the U.S. National Intelligence Council under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama and was senior director for European and Russian affairs on the U.S. National Security Council under Donald Trump. She emerged as a public figure after testifying before Congress in 2019 on Russian interference in the 2016 election during the first impeachment inquiry against Trump. Hill noted that the Israel-Hamas war had shifted some of the world’s attention from Ukraine, a development that might not bode well for Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelensky. She stressed the need for the U.S. government to remain vigilant. “Russia will always matter,” said Hill. “It’s not just about the battlefields or the way we think about nuclear weapons. It’s the inescapable fact that we have this large country, the largest country on Earth in terms of land mass … Because of its strategic location, the size of its land mass, its environmental impact, we’re not going to be able to avoid dealing with Russia.” For example, Russia, which has the world’s largest forest area, must be included in any conversation about climate change, said Hill. “Russia has to be part of the solution, not just part of the problem,” she said. Hill, who said her fascination with Russian history and literature began while she was growing up in England, lamented the ways in which U.S. administrations have not been able to maintain a consistent policy toward Russia. “Every new administration that comes in rediscovers Russia,” said Hill. “We haven’t been consistent in trying to think about the way that Russia acts, or the way Putin acts … The one thing I would say about Putin and Russia is this: Never write either of these off because Russia always matters and right now, while he is still with us, Putin matters as well.” Another aspect to consider is Russia’s relationship with China, said Hill. China’s president, Xi Jinping, visited Russia in February 2023 in a show of the solid ties between the two nations. China has become Russia’s most important trading partner in the aftermath of Western sanctions imposed against Russia. U.S. policies toward both Russia and China have played a role in pushing them together, Hill said, along with their shared economic interests. “It is also a strategic imperative for China and Russia to pull closer together,” said Hill. “There are also the results of the personal relationship between Xi and Putin, who think about the world in similar ways.” This seminar was moderated by Graham Allison, Douglas Dillon Professor of Government, and Ambassador Paula Dobriansky, Belfer Center Senior Fellow and former Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs.

STATE HOUSE NEWS SERVICE By COLIN A. YOUNG State House News Service State House News Service BOSTON — An Appeals Court judge on Tuesday rejected suspended Cannabis Control Commission Chair Shannon O’Brien’s petition, once again clearing the way for Treasurer Deborah Goldberg to schedule a meeting that could lead to O’Brien’s firing. Superior Court Judge Debra Squires-Lee in December rejected process guardrails that O’Brien sought and ruled that Goldberg could consider O’Brien’s firing under certain circumstances. O’Brien filed a petition last month seeking to have an Appeals Court judge vacate the lower court decision, and issue a new order meeting O’Brien’s demands. Appeals Court Judge Rachel Hershfang said in an order late Tuesday that the arguments O’Brien presented in her appeal do not meet the “high standard” necessary to overturn a Superior Court ruling. “My review of the record reveals no error of law or abuse of discretion in the motion judge’s ruling that the Supreme Judicial Court’s various decisions in the Levy cases govern the analysis of the process due to the plaintiff ... and that the procedural protections described in the revised protocol are adequate to satisfy those requirements,” Hershfang wrote. Joe Baerlein, a spokesperson for O’Brien, said Tuesday night that O’Brien “looks forward to the truth coming out of this hearing process.” “The legal efforts to date have been about ensuring that Chair O’Brien has the opportunity for an open and impartial hearing and an opportunity to defend her reputation,” Baerlein said. Under the “protocol” for the eventual O’Brien-Goldberg meeting, which Goldberg’s office proposed and the Superior Court judge blessed, the meeting that could result in O’Brien’s firing cannot take place until at least 15 business days after a second investigatory report, this one related to O’Brien’s conduct toward former CCC Executive Director Shawn Collins, is shared with O’Brien’s side along with an updated rationale for her suspension and potential termination. That exchange had not happened as of Tuesday night. “We are grateful that the Appeals Court has made a decision that allows the process to go forward,” said Andrew Napolitano, a spokesperson for Goldberg. Article continues after... Goldberg suspended O’Brien, a former state treasurer herself and the Democratic Party’s 2002 nominee for governor, with pay in September after having appointed her to chair the CCC a year prior. Goldberg has given two justifications for O’Brien’s suspension and possible firing: that she is alleged to have made racially insensitive remarks and that she mistreated Collins, a former Goldberg deputy. O’Brien has denied the allegations against her. During O’Brien’s bumpy year as chair, the CCC also wrestled with thorny and awkward issues surrounding O’Brien and her one-time ownership stake in a cultivation company Greenfield Greenery LLC that had an application before the CCC for an outdoor cultivation site on Leyden Road in Greenfield. O’Brien was later cleared of any wrongdoing. Similar to Superior Court Judge Debra Squires-Lee, the Appeals Court judge on Tuesday suggested that O’Brien’s next course of legal action may be to contest the validity of the rationale Goldberg relies on if she does fire O’Brien after the eventual meeting takes place. Squires-Lee wrote in December that it would be premature for the court to resolve whether the basis for removal satisfies the statute “as the treasurer has yet to take final action.” “I echo the conclusion of the Superior Court judge,” Hershfang wrote Tuesday, “following Levy I, that consideration of that issue would be premature.” 06-01-2024 5:53 PM 06-01-2024 3:07 PM 06-01-2024 3:04 PM 06-01-2024 1:45 PM Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy About Us Accessibility Social Media • Facebook • X • Youtube By using this site, you agree with our use of cookies to personalize your experience, measure ads and monitor how our site works to improve it for our users Copyright © 2016 to 2024 by Newspapers of Massachusetts, Inc.

Micro-spikes and hiking poles are recommended. Views of Boston Harbor greet those who summit one of the many hills. (Paige Impink photo) Winter hiking is a great way to get some exercise and enjoy local trails. With the unseasonably mild con\xadditions, we used the opportunity to explore the Blue Hills Reservation. There are so many trails to choose from in the 7,000 acre state property, located ten miles south of Bos\xadton. The trails are rocky, a result of glacial depo\xadsits. Trail markers have a four digit numbering system, helping orient hikers as they crisscross the trails. A map is recommended but the markers make identifying your progress easy. Micro spikes and hiking poles might be helpful if a recent rain or snowfall has impact on the trails. There are hikes of varying length and difficulty and all levels of ability will find options at Blue Hills. Views of Boston Harbor and the harbor islands are beautiful in one direction, contrasted against acres of forested hills in the other. The Blue Hills reservation spans the towns of Ran\xaddolph, Milton, Quincy and Dedham and is a De\xadpartment of Conserva\xadtion and Recreation property, free and open to all. It is an extremely large undeveloped parcel of conservation land that has been preserved for the Common\xadwealth. The Skyline Trail is a 15 mile out and back trail that can be hiked in pieces or in its entirety. We used the trail head at the Un\xadquity Road lot, but there are numerous parking areas and access points in the park. Skyline is considered a challenging trail and can take many hours to complete. There are several hills for visitors to summit, including Hemingway Hill, Hancock Hill, Wolcott Hill and the iconic Great Blue Hill. The Blue Hills Weather Observatory is a weather station at the top of Great Blue Hill, the highest point in the park, which is open to visitors. The observatory and science center are designated a national land\xadmark and offers programs and discussions about wea\xadther and climate. The park has over 120 miles of trails, so be sure to have a map and a charged cell phone. Being prepared for hiking on trails at Blue Hills, even though the park is within view of a major city, is as important as hiking in the White Mountains or any other trail. Blue Hills offer many recreation options include mountain biking, downhill and cross country skiing, and non-motorized boating in season. You’ll en\xadcounter lots of trail runners and day hikers. Dogs are welcomed but must be on leash. Not to be missed is the Trailside Museum and Houghton’s Pond which are also part of the greater Blue Hills Reser\xadvation recreation area. https://www.mass.gov/locations/blue-hills-reservation Log In Keep it Clean.

Steward “has agreed upon the principal terms for a significant financial transaction to help stabilize our company,” Steward Executive Vice President Dr. Michael Callum said in a message to colleagues. Callum’s message was shared by a nurses’ union, and a Steward official confirmed that it was sent to employees on Friday morning. However, Callum indicated in his letter that some Steward facilities may eventually come under new ownership as the company continues to grapple with its financial issues, including overdue loan and rent payments. “This bridge financing and the terms of this transaction have been agreed upon and the first tranche of funding is imminent,” Callum wrote. “This funding will help stabilize operations, including the resumption of virtually all elective cases, and more importantly allows us to continue operations at all of our Massachusetts hospitals. To be clear: We have no current plans to close any of our hospitals in Massachusetts.” Steward owns hospitals in Dorchester, Brockton, Haverhill, Methuen, Taunton, Ayer, Norwood, Fall River, and Brighton, all of which serve a high volume of Medicaid and Medicare patients. Earlier last week, the Department of Public Health held a public hearing about Steward’s previously announced plan to close New England Sinai Hospital in Stoughton in April due to losses incurred there. “Moreover, the Company is advanced in an M&A process that would bring in a significant equity partner to our physician organization, and the Company has already received very significant bids as part of this process,” Callum added. “The bridge financing will get the Company to the closing of the M&A process and will provide the necessary capital for a robust national physician group and the time needed for Steward to consider transferring one or more of our hospitals to other operators.” Those arrangements should allow Steward to get through “this challenging time,” Callum said. “We are committed to working collaboratively with leaders in the state towards the shared goal of providing exceptional service to our patients.” Congresswoman Lori Trahan said Steward should disclose more details of its financing plans. “I’m glad that families in Haverhill, Methuen, the Nashoba Valley, and beyond can go to sleep tonight knowing their community hospital will still be open in the morning,” she said in a statement. “These are critical facilities that people depend on for all types of care, and Steward executives owe it to their 40,000-plus patients and 16,000 employees in Massachusetts to be absolutely clear about what the next steps are.

The facility will house over 300 migrants. AP Petterly Jean-Baptiste and his wife, Leonne Ysnardin, behind center, immigrants from Haiti, wait with their two children on Nov. 16 at the Immigrant Family Services Institute in the Mattapan neighborhood of Boston for transportation to a shelter in Quincy. AP By COLIN A. YOUNG State House News Service State House News Service Two polls released this week gave mixed signals regarding voters’ feelings about the job Gov. Maura Healey is doing and the level of support for Nikki Haley here ahead of next month’s presidential primary, but what was clear from both surveys was that Massachusetts voters have immigration and border control at the front of their minds. Immigration has grown into a major issue on Beacon Hill over the last year or so as a surge of migrants seeking asylum or other federal protection in Massachusetts has stressed the state’s emergency shelter system and budget. It is also shaping up as a central issue in the expected presidential election rematch between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump this fall. A Suffolk University poll of 1,000 Massachusetts voters who said they were at least somewhat likely to vote this November found that “immigration and border security” was the second most important issue on voters’ minds (25.2% said it was the top issue), slightly trailing “the future of American democracy” (27.1%). Similarly, “illegal immigration” ranked by respondents as the second-biggest threat to U.S. interests (27.7%), behind only “China’s expanding power across the globe” (28.2%). And 46.8% of people polled by Suffolk said that the U.S. border and the number of immigrants entering the country (legally or illegally is not specified) is “an emergency situation, and among the most serious issues facing the U.S.” Another 31.5% of respondents said it is “a major problem, but not an emergency.” A separate poll of 788 likely Massachusetts primary voters released Thursday by the Fiscal Alliance Foundation revealed strong feelings around the migrant situation, with a majority of respondents saying they do not think Massachusetts can accommodate additional migrants (65.2%) and that tax dollars should not be used to provide shelter to migrants (53.3%). “Massachusetts voters told us they see immigration as a major issue in the 2024 election, and it is certainly an issue to watch between now and November,” David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, said when his poll was released Wednesday. “The majority of voters support a temporary work visa as a way for migrants to start a new life while they are here, work to support their family, pay taxes, and be accounted for within the communities they are living in.” The Suffolk poll asked the more specific questions about the migrant crisis. For example, it polled the Healey administration’s decision to use the Melnea Cass Recreation Center in Roxbury as a temporary overflow shelter. Just less than half of respondents, 48.9%, said they support moving migrants from Logan Airport to the Roxbury rec center while 40.3% said they opposed the move and 10% said they were undecided. By a margin of almost 2 to 1 (61.7% to 32.3%), voters polled by Suffolk supported granting temporary work visas to migrants being housed at the Roxbury site. The Healey administration has maintained that getting migrants authorized to work is critical to moving families out of state shelters and taking some of the pressure off the system. Article continues after... Fiscal Alliance spokesman Paul Craney said the handful of migrant crisis-related questions in his group’s latest poll tapped into the strongest policy issue opinions he can remember seeing from any of his group’s previous polls. “It really stood out, it was to the point where we were double-checking to see if was an error,” he said. “But we’ve never seen such strong feelings toward questions before.” The Fiscal Alliance poll asked voters, “With no source of sustainable funding going forward, do you think Massachusetts taxpayers can continue to sustain this current level of migration into the state?” About 72.5% of respondents said no, while just under 14% said it is sustainable. Since declaring a state of emergency around the shelter crisis last summer, Healey has repeatedly called on the federal government to provide funding for states like Massachusetts that have been overwhelmed by the surge of migrants. She and other public officials have repeatedly declared that the problem is not one that Massachusetts created. Voters seem to agree with Healey. The Fiscal Alliance poll found that about two-thirds of voters hold the federal government most responsible for the flow of migrants (38.58% blame Biden and 26.52% blame Congress), while about 11.4% blame state government (6.98% blame Healey and 4.44% blame the state Legislature). Whether voters here carry their blame of Biden into the voting booth remains to be seen. Both polls found Biden has the support of more than 70% of likely Democratic primary voters — Suffolk’s poll put him at 70.26% and the Fiscal Alliance poll pegged the president’s support at 73.5%. The Massachusetts presidential primary is March 5. The two polls painted slightly different pictures of the Republican primary, a contest that is essentially down to Trump or Haley. The Fiscal Alliance polls showed Trump besting Haley with 65% support to her 21% support. But the Suffolk poll shows a tighter race, with Trump leading Haley 55% to 38%. Jim Eltringham, whose D.C. polling company Advantage Inc. conducted the poll for the Fiscal Alliance, said the unenrolled voters he surveyed were twice as likely to pull a Republican primary ballot than a Democratic primary ballot next month, in part because that contest is viewed as the more competitive race. But it also could indicate something about support for Haley here, he said. “If you dig in and you look at Nikki Haley’s support, a lot of it is similar to New Hampshire, where a lot of her support is coming from those independents who are were pulling [Republican] ballots,” Eltringham said. “The independents who were pulling [Republican] ballots are still breaking for Trump, but at a lesser rate.” And the two polls also differed on how voters feel about the job Healey is doing as governor. The Fiscal Alliance poll found that 46.32% of voters have either a strongly favorable view of Healey (26.52%) or a somewhat favorable view of her (19.8%). And 37.31% view the governor either strongly (26.14%) or somewhat (11.17%) unfavorably. Suffolk’s poll showed that 54% of voters either approve (35%) or strongly approve (15%) the job that Healey is doing as governor, while 31% said they either disapprove (15.1%) or strongly disapprove (15.9%) of the job the first-term governor is doing. 06-01-2024 3:12 PM 06-01-2024 1:42 PM 06-01-2024 1:38 PM 06-01-2024 1:37 PM Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy About Us Accessibility Social Media • Facebook • X • Youtube • Instagram By using this site, you agree with our use of cookies to personalize your experience, measure ads and monitor how our site works to improve it for our users Copyright © 2016 to 2024 by H.S.

But the panel, which included state regulators, environmental groups, labor leaders and representatives of utility companies, was unable to reach a consensus on many of the proposed regulatory changes. One proposal called for a shift from “replacement” to “repair” of leak-prone natural gas lines, which proponents argued would save ratepayers money and accelerate the state’s transition from fossil fuels to wind, solar and other renewable energy. But the utility panelists voted against in opposition, arguing that it would compromise safety and exceed the working group’s mandate. “A shift in policy that prioritizes repair over replacement does not reduce the risk that leak-prone pipes pose to people, property, and the environment,” they wrote in a summary of the report. “Both cast iron and cathodically unprotected steel will continue to pose concerns as they age.” The panel was created under a 2014 state law that requires utilities to track and grade all gas leaks on a scale of 1 to 3, with 1 being most serious, and immediately repair the most hazardous. The panel’s report noted that Massachusetts gas companies are spending more than $800 million a year installing new gas mains to replace aging leak-prone pipes. The new pipes have a lifespan of 50 years and will be paid for by energy consumers in the form of higher rates, they noted. But the report’s authors said estimates suggest utilities will spend $34 billion on new gas infrastructure, which would not be fully paid for until 2097.

STAFF FILE PHOTO/PAUL FRANZ By MARKELLE SMITH and RAE ETTENGER This July, in the Connecticut River watershed, from northern Vermont and New Hampshire downstream to western Massachusetts, heavy rains brought intense flooding that swelled rivers, turned backyards into ponds, and ravaged agricultural fields. Residents of the watershed are familiar with some flooding, but as the planet continues to warm and extreme weather events become more intense and frequent, communities are looking for long-term solutions for the events of July 2023. Thanks to the leadership of U.S. Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, there is a reason that residents can be hopeful that the Connecticut River watershed will be stewarded and restored for generations to come. The two have introduced legislation in Congress to enhance partnerships and coordination among nonprofits, community members, tribal organizations, and state and federal agencies to increase climate resilience, protect wildlife habitat, and promote access to outdoor recreation in the watershed for all. The Connecticut River Watershed Partnership Act, when passed, will allow this watershed to join a prestigious group of ecologically and economically significant others, including the Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay watersheds, that have been protected by federal legislation rooted in regional partnerships. Led by the Connecticut River Watershed Partnership, a coalition of watershed-based partner organizations formerly known as the Friends of Conte will create a dedicated funding stream that supports non-regulatory conservation, restoration, education, and recreation efforts in the watershed. The Connecticut River watershed, which spans 7.2 million acres and shares a boundary with the Conte Refuge, was established in 1991 and is the largest multistate national wildlife refuge bounded by a watershed. The Connecticut River, New England’s longest and most culturally significant water body, drains 11,000 square miles that are home to 2.4 million residents, as well as hundreds of plant and animal species, many of which are priorities for state and/or federal protection. The Conte Refuge is protected in part thanks to the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF); a keystone piece of federal conservation legislation that has protected outdoor treasures in every state in the country. In Massachusetts and the Connecticut River watershed, the fund has played a critical role funding the conservation of places we value for recreation and other benefits nature provides. Such gains in land conservation would not be possible without our LWCF champions in Congress, like Sen. Shaheen and Rep. McGovern. Though the recently passed Great American Outdoors Act has permanently secured $900 million annually for LWCF projects, federal conservation funding remains in peril as Congress threatens to pass a $100 million rescission of LWCF. While proponents argue that these funds are “left over” or “unspent,” there are many existing LWCF project needs across the Connecticut River watershed that could use the funds now, especially as the region faces extreme weather, so that argument doesn’t hold much water here in Massachusetts. Read on to see a few examples of projects in the Connecticut River watershed that could be funded by the proposed $100 million rescission of LWCF dollars and with passage of the Connecticut River Watershed Partnership Act. Article continues after... LWCF would provide funding to purchase land from willing landowners in these two areas of Massachusetts: ■In Hadley, the major body of water flowing through this primarily agricultural community is the Fort River. The Fort River drains a 35,830-acre watershed and is the longest free-flowing tributary to the Connecticut River in Massachusetts. There are various habitat types in this sub-watershed, including hardwood, floodplain and grasslands. The Fort River Division of the Conte Refuge consists of 295 conserved acres that are ideal for outdoor recreation, including hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, and a one-mile-long, fully accessible natural trail. ■In Chesterfield, the Dead Branch Division of the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge currently consists of 100 acres. This division is primarily made up of northern hardwood forest that is home to native wildlife such as the wood thrush, Canadian warbler, and ruffed grouse. Dead Branch Brook contains some of the best habitat for threatened freshwater mussels in the commonwealth, and its cold, clean waters are a result of the extensive forests that buffer this tributary to the Connecticut River. These examples in the Connecticut River watershed are just a few of the thousands of projects across the country waiting for funds that would be left uncompleted if Congress passes the proposed $100 million rescission of Land and Water Conservation funds. We are deeply thankful to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren for joining Sen. Shaheen’s letter opposing any rollback of LWCF funds. We encourage every member of Congress to work with Senate leadership to ensure this rescission of LWCF funds does not become law. We are fortunate to have congressional champions of conservation throughout the entire Connecticut River watershed, who understand that both land conservation through LWCF and complementary restoration, stewardship and management investments through watershed-wide partnership legislation are vital to the health of this incredible resource. McGovern experienced the positive impacts of outdoor recreation at a recent event along the banks of the river in Hadley celebrating his leadership in introducing the Connecticut River Watershed Partnership Act. McGovern remarked that the time spent by the Connecticut River was “a rejuvenating shot in the arm” after spending the week in Washington, D.C. The largest river in New England provides clean drinking water and recreation opportunities to millions of urban and rural residents while also providing solutions to the climate and biodiversity crisis, so we need to give back in return. We encourage all Massachusetts’ members of Congress to co-sponsor the Connecticut River Watershed Partnership Act to enhance and restore the ecosystems, economy and communities of the watershed for generations to come.

They’ll be later in the day. According to the MBTA, from Feb. 5 to 9, Mass Coastal Railroad may be moving its daily freight operations to evenings to accommodate that testing. People who live near the rail lines in Taunton, Fall River and New Bedford could see freight trains passing through on weekdays between 5 p.m. and midnight. Brush-cutting. Crews will spend the next couple of months clearing out vegetation along the right-of-way up and down the South Coast Rail lines, for safety and visibility reasons. Expect that work to take place between Mondays and Fridays, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Signal testing. MBTA workers are installing and testing the signal systems along the entire rail line. If you see a flagger guiding traffic through a train crossing, follow their directions. Dan Medeiros can be reached at dmedeiros@heraldnews.com.

(Saed Hindash | For lehighvalleylive.com)Saed Hindash | For lehighvalleylive.com We are just over a month away from when clocks will “spring forward” to daylight saving time, and it is actually on a historic date this year. The time will change at 2 a.m. on Sunday, March 10, when the hour will immediately move ahead to 3 a.m., creating longer evenings for the summer months. The clocks will change back to standard time on Sunday, Nov. 3, at 2 a.m. March 10, 2024, is the 55th anniversary of when James Earl Ray pleaded guilty in Memphis, Tennessee, to assassinating civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., though he later went back on that plea and maintained his innocence until his death. That took place on March 10, 1969. Coincidentally, March 10 is also the 111th anniversary of the date that former slave, abolitionist and American hero Harriet Tubman died in 1913. More recently, March 10 was the final day before the COVID-19 disease was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in 2020. It is the birthday of actor Chuck Norris, Boston rock musician Tom Scholz, actor Richard Grant, blues musician Ronnie Earl, actress Sharon Stone, rock musician Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, actor Stephen Mailer, rapper Timbaland, Olympic gold medalist Shannon Miller, country singer Carrie Underwood and actor Emily Osment, according to the Associated Press. Daylight saving time begins the second Sunday in March and continues through the first Sunday in November. Most people would prefer to keep the clocks the same rather than changing them twice per year. A CBS News poll of 1,612 adults indicated that most Americans don’t like changing the clocks. Of those sampled, 46% said they preferred daylight saving time all year round, 33% wanted standard time all year round and only 21% preferred the current system of switching back and forth. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio reintroduced the Sunshine Protection Act both in 2022 and 2023 to create permanent daylight saving time. “This ritual of changing time twice a year is stupid,” Rubio said in a statement on his website. “Locking the clock has overwhelming bipartisan and popular support. This Congress, I hope that we can finally get this done.” The Senate passed the bill in 2022, but it wasn’t passed in the U.S. House. There was no action taken last year. At the state level, a Washington state Senate committee last month held a hearing on a law to stop the state from having to switch the clocks at all and maintain Pacific Standard Time throughout the year. Doing so would fall in line with research by Baystate Medical Center sleep medicine doctor Karin Johnson. She said her research completed with colleagues on sleep cycles shows that permanent standard time can improve brain functionality, mood, focus, and help reduce car crashes and the risk of developing long-term health conditions. “Timezones were designed to have the sun as close to being overhead at noon as possible,” Dr. Johnson said in 2022. “Daylight savings time shifts the clock an hour so we get later sunrises and sunsets. But unfortunately, our bodies don’t go by the clock time, they go by the sun time.” A Baystate Medical Center spokesperson at the time clarified in a statement that the medical center does not promote Johnson’s views. “Dr Johnson’s comments were not a reflection of Baystate Health but her own personal position on the subject as a physician and involvement with the organization promoting it,” the statement read. Standard time spans for just over four months of the year, with daylight saving time making up the remaining eight, but it used to be closer to a 50-50 split. That changed with the Energy Policy Act of 2005. A provision in that law authored by U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., then a U.S. Representative, enacted the extension of daylight saving time. Markey partnered with U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., to write the provision, which amended the Uniform Time Act of 1996 to increase daylight saving time and reduce standard time. The new dates for clock changes first took place in 2007. Markey later reported that the change in time led to about a half billion dollars in electricity savings and a reduction in 2.9 million barrels of oil as people shut the lights off earlier. However, a U.S. Department of Energy report that came out in October of 2008 threw cold water on the notion of energy savings, stating that extended daylight saving time reduced electricity by only 0.03% over the course of the year. Two states, Hawaii and Arizona, opted out of using daylight saving time — Hawaii in 1967 and Arizona in 1968. Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands also do not participate in daylight saving time. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, there are many states that are trying to stop from having the clocks switch. In 2023, there were three bills to establish permanent standard time in Massachusetts, but none was enacted. All told last year, there were 75 pieces of legislation filed in 29 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. None of those bills became law that year, however. There are 19 states that are ready to switch to permanent daylight saving time — Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Washington and Wyoming — but congressional approval is required first. Germany and Austria were the first countries to use daylight saving time in 1916 in order to conserve energy, according to National Geographic. But portions of Canada beat them to the punch by eight years, according to timeanddate.com, which said that residents of Port Arthur, Ontario, made the first daylight saving time zone by turning their clocks forward an hour from July 1 to Sept. 1, 1908. In the United States, a clock change called “Fast Time” was introduced in 1918, but it was repealed less than a year later. Some cities, including Boston, New York and Pittsburgh, continued to use it, however. The concept was reintroduced in 1942 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and daylight saving time, then called “War Time,” was established through 1945. Between 1945 and 1966, no uniform rules for changing clocks existed. In 1966, the United States passed the Uniform Time Act of 1966, which provided a framework for a nationwide daylight saving time schedule.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:34 pm BOSTON — The state’s revenue collections have fallen below benchmarks several months in a row as fiscal watchdogs call on Beacon Hill to tighten its financial belt.

Year-to-date revenue is $21.4 billion, or $212 million less that year-to-date revenue, according to the state Department of Revenue.

Maura Healey’s policies and her support for the new 4% millionaires’ tax, which it argues is driving away the state’s top earners. “The governor’s response is inadequate,” MassFiscal spokesman Paul Craney said. “State House leaders cannot simply ignore what is driving this trend, they must confront the fact that their income surtax has not only made Massachusetts among the least economically competitive states in the country, but it is also driving out tax revenues.” Craney said Healey should abandon her push for approval of legislation that would allow cities and towns to increase their local meals and hotel taxes to generate more money. “If Governor Healey wants to reverse this course, she needs to rein in spending and consider broad-based tax cuts,” he said. “Until then, the income surtax will continue to drive taxpayers elsewhere and state revenues will continue to decline.” Healey, a Democrat, has acknowledged the declining tax revenues but argues that the fundamentals underpinning the state’s economy remain strong.

This award represents the City’s largest ever Continuum of Care award. The funds will be distributed among 18 nonprofit organizations that provide critical services and support to Boston’s unhoused residents and advance Mayor Wu’s goals to end homelessness in the City. The funding is made available through the HUD’s annual Continuum of Care awards, a grant program coordinated by the Mayor’s Office of Housing (MOH). Over the last nine years, MOH has grown the funding the City receives from this grant by more than 111 percent, from $22.6 million in 2015 to $47.7 million this year, as a result of their competitive application and demonstrated ability to deliver results in collaboration with partner agencies. “Boston residents and families in every neighborhood deserve the opportunity to reside in secure, stable, and affordable housing,” said Mayor Michelle Wu. “In our ongoing commitment to make Boston a city where everyone has a home, the Continuum of Care grants from HUD play a vital role in assisting organizations dedicated to providing essential services and support for our unhoused residents. I extend my gratitude to HUD Secretary Fudge and the entire Massachusetts Congressional delegation for securing the City of Boston’s largest Continuum of Care award to date and for their unwavering support as we collaboratively strive to eradicate homelessness in our city.” The City will allocate this federal HUD funding to organizations that offer a range of services and supports including housing search, the creation of housing for people experiencing long-term homelessness, rapid re-housing funds, and stabilization services to allow newly housed families and long-term-homeless individuals to receive the support they need to succeed. In total, this $47 million award will continue to provide crucial support for nearly 1,900 homeless and formerly homeless households, offering tailored services to help them obtain and maintain permanent housing. “Boston has a successful network of experienced non-profit organizations committed to serving our homeless,” said Sheila Dillon, Chief of Housing. “This funding award allows us to continue the important work of moving our homeless residents from shelters and the street into housing that they can afford with the services they need to be successful. Given the high cost of housing in Boston and the region, this funding award, the largest in our Continuum’s history, is more important than ever.” Four new programs sponsored by three providers received funding through this year’s award. Hildebrand Family Self-Help, Inc. will receive funding to create a permanent supportive housing program with wrap-around services for Boston families experiencing long-term homelessness. Justice 4 Housing will create a new program to swiftly serve survivors of domestic violence with safe housing and case management. Victory Programs will fund two new projects that will serve survivors of gender-based violence and LGBTQ+ youth, ages 18 – 24. “This funding will provide more than $47 million to homeless service providers throughout Boston who provide crucial resources in the fight to prevent and end homelessness,” said HUD New England Regional Administrator Juana Matias. “We will continue to work together with our Continuum of Care partners to find solutions that ensure every Bostonian has a safe place to call home.” “I am thrilled Hildebrand Family Self-Help Center is a new awardee in the Boston Continuum of Care,” said Shiela Y. Moore, CEO, Hildebrand Family Self-Help, Inc. “The Supportive Housing Team of the Mayor’s Office of Housing have been great partners, and we look forward to deepening our work together in reducing family homelessness. Given that Hildebrand is on the frontlines of providing emergency shelter, this funding allows us to add 12 permanent supportive housing units for children and families currently unhoused.” “We are incredibly grateful for this new Continuum of Care funding, which will allow Victory Programs to expand our commitment to addressing critical needs to include survivors of gender-based violence and LGBTQ+ youth,” said Sarah Porter, Executive Director of Victory Programs. “We appreciate the strong efforts of Boston’s supportive housing team; a phenomenal partner.

Boston offers services to homeless individuals by offering wraparound services to those who require the additional level of care. Chronically homeless individuals have barriers that create challenges to remaining housed. These barriers can include physical disabilities, substance use disorders, and mental health challenges. As part of Boston’s plan, the City is committed to a “housing first” approach to homelessness which is based on the belief that everyone should have access to permanent housing. In 2023, Boston housed 2,220 people experiencing homelessness, including 463 family households and 901 adult individuals. Among those are 119 unaccompanied youth and young adults as well as 157 veterans. Last fall, a dozen City departments and partner agencies transformed how the City cares for unsheltered constituents impacted by substance use disorder, homelessness, and untreated mental illness, with a focus on the ‘Mass and Cass’ / Newmarket neighborhood. Mayor Wu and the City of Boston extend their gratitude to the Biden-Harris Administration and HUD for their continued commitment to addressing homelessness and supporting communities nationwide.

Wanderer Residents and others who have loved ones buried in Marion crowded into the Town House’s Annex meeting room on Tuesday night to air their concerns about proposed changes to the town’s Cemetery Rules, Regulations and fees during a public hearing before the Marion Select Board. Citing altogether new regulations and changes to most of the 20 existing regulations, Select Board Chairman Toby Burr went through them in order, asking for public response while commissioners Margie Baldwin, Helen Hills and Paul St. Don fielded those responses. The result was an emotionally charged, public hearing that lasted over 90 minutes of the roughly 2½-hour meeting. When the Number 14 regulation stipulating that plantings be limited to the front side of the gravestone and not at its side or behind except for military markers, resident Sarah Briggs referenced a “derogatory” comment made to her father (Sherman Briggs) about how her late mother had handled the gravesite and said she was disgusted with the comment and heartbroken that a regulation was being proposed that would prohibit her from placing a garden flag honoring her mother’s pastime. Commissioner Helen Hills said she looked at the site and said it looks fine and has no egregious problems but just needs to push back more to the stone. Similarly, April Nye discussed her family plot and her 90-year-old mother-in-law, who lives for the caretaking of the gravesite including the placement of a little fire truck. “The changes seem to be of a personal nature of what some of you would want to see aesthetically,” said Nye. “A grandmother has toys at the site of her grandson. I think a lot of things are subjective to committee members that should not be imposed on us. … I would hate to see this pushed forward.” Select Board member Randy Parker clarified early on that no vote would be taken on this night, but that message got lost amidst a long line of impassioned stories and arguments. Town Administrator Geoff Gorman listed debated issues on a pair of grease boards that were full of blue ink by the time the hearing was suspended and continued. Baldwin, who has served as chair of the volunteer Cemetery Commission for 18 years, opened by stating a personal apology for prior comments on the matter that were considered insensitive to residents. She clarified that most of the proposed regulations are not new, that she is a participant among the bereaved in town and willing to listen to any complaints. Baldwin stressed that “decisions are carefully deliberated between the seven of us and not taken lightly.” At the crux of the complaints were proposed regulations on plantings and decoration around gravestones that several residents consider subjective and unfair. A proposal for a regulation against picnics at the cemetery drew the attention of Mattapoisett resident Carly Lavin, who says she likes to bring her children to the cemetery where they learn to celebrate the lives of their loved ones. Residents Bill Washburn and Pat DaCosta both questioned how the town could police the cemeteries, to which Baldwin replied that is not the intention of the proposals or even a reasonable possibility. Washburn thinks 18 inches is more reasonable than 12 inches for a perimeter, and he made a pitch for 4-foot-high shepherd’s hooks. Another longtime Marion resident, Joe Zora, articulated his frustration with the proposed regulations, stating that they infringe on people’s rights to grieve on their own terms. Later, Marion resident Andrew Kuhl would reference state law in pointing out that the proposed regulations are not enforceable simply because the removal of anything from a gravesite is illegal and subject to imprisonment. At the same time, Kuhl applauded the commission’s effort and suggested collaborating on refinement of the proposals so that the commission and the DPW can achieve its goals without encroaching on the rights of the cemetery goers. The Department of Public Works is responsible for mowing the cemeteries, and going outside of the 12-inch perimeter with stones and objects, including deteriorating, plastic flowers results in difficult conditions in the cemeteries, according to the DPW and the commission. Brian Dunn said he went to the cemetery on Christmas Eve after dusk and has also gone early to watch the sunrise. Helen Hills noted that the vandalism at the cemetery happens at night. The public hearing was closed with a plan to formulate a revised set of regulations and fees, but the Select Board has yet to decide whether or not there will be another public hearing prior to the board’s vote. The Marion Fire Department has endured a flurry of personnel changes as outlined by Fire Chief Brian Jackvony during his 6:00 pm appointment with the board. Assistant Chief Allen Denham is moving on to Senior Reserve status. The town will still lean on Denham’s expertise, and he will work on special projects. Joel Waters, captain of Engine 1 with 10 years on force, has been promoted to assistant chief. Captain Christopher Nye retires with four decades of service with the Marion Fire Department, and Lieutenant Charlie Bradley, with over three decades of service, has also resigned. Jackvony offered public thanks and went on to announce the promotions of Lieutenant Adam Novacek and Josh Bardy. New recruit Dalton Ryan is leaving the department for personal reasons. Jackvony said the department has successfully met its goal to recruit 20 members over four years; the retention rate over that span is 70%, as many find full-time jobs in other fire departments. Amidst manpower challenges, the department received an improvement grant of $105,000 used for personal protective equipment, videos and public relations. Over 60% of recruits come from outside the community. Other grant awards to Marion include a brush truck from FEMA valued at $300,000 (bid opening on March 23), a 2022 grant for 25 new apparatus units (town share $9,500 or 10%), 5,000 psi compressors; $15,498 for wearable gear, a 50/50 DCR grant requiring $2,500 from the town. The ladder truck has been delayed to September, but Marion is locked into a contract, sparing the town $50,000 (4.5%) in inflation-related costs. The Community EMS Program saw 111 home visits last year, and there is a professional-development conference later this month and a training on March 4 at the Cushman Community Center. The ISO (public protection classification review) is Marion’s first in 10 years and involves data collection, documentation training, data on structure fires and losses. The total number of runs in 2023 included 1,009 medical calls. The department’s expanding radio-box system connects Tabor Academy directly and takes third parties out of the equation. In his Town Administrators Report, Gorman said that excavation at the Maritime Center has begun, that the foundation will be poured by the end of the week, that wood framing will commence by March 14 with watertight enclosure by the end of April. Bid documents for the new DPW operations building construction are due March 28, at which point the town will have a full understanding of budgetary requirements. Gorman reported that Marion has endured double its winter rainfall from 2021, but the town’s catch basins are working and clear. He encouraged anyone who witnesses flooding to contact the DPW and stressed that the purpose of the stormwater system is to remove water from the roads only. The town has also received a nonmonetary Cybersecurity Grant for network assessments and free training estimated to be worth $50,000. In Action Items, the Select Board approved Police Chief Richard Nighelli’s request to appoint Sommor Cardoso to full-time officer. The board also delegated Nighelli the responsibility to assign police details for all 2024 elections and approved early voting by mail and in person for all local elections (May 17.) The board signed and executed the Bill of Sale for the Water Main Infrastructure for 50 Oakdale Avenue. The board rejected a request for a Water/Sewer Abatement at 12 Emils Way. The board approved new streetlights at Quails Crossing and Partridge Place. The board approved two Water/Sewer commitments of $1,425.67 (quarterly billing December 14, 2023) and $478.38 (final readings January 22.) In a public hearing, the board approved the transfer of an off-premises All Alcohol License from Spirits to MDM Wine5 LLC, dba Vinodivino at 154 Front Street. The boutique wine shop, self-described as high end with four existing stores in Boston, Newton, Needham and Brookline, hopes to open in mid-April. The next meeting of the Marion Select Board is scheduled for Wednesday, February 21, at 6:00 pm at the Annex building of the Town House facing Main Street.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:26 pm Gillette Stadium will host seven soccer matches for the 2026 World Cup. Hosting seven matches for the 2026 World Cup at Gillette Stadium was more than expected and will give the local and regional economy a welcome boost, officials said Monday. Among the matches that will be played at Gillette will be five group stage matches, one match in the round of 32 and a quarterfinal match on July 9, 2026, it was announced Sunday by the FIFA. Up to 14 national teams will visit Foxboro starting June 13, 2026 to compete for soccer’s grand prize. “Bringing the World Cup to Foxboro will have a huge economic impact to the entire region,” Jack Lank, president and CEO of the United Regional Chamber of Commerce, said in an email. “Every hotel, restaurant, local coffee shop, rental car agency, livery service and every entertainment venue will benefit from the crowds coming to watch the matches. “Soccer has become one of the most watched sporting events in the world. Gillette Stadium, Patriot Place and many of the local business will have to hire more staff to accommodate the anticipated crowds that will be in the area for the World Cup. Similar to the millions of dollars injected into the region from the Army-Navy game, this will be another great ‘shot in the arm’ for the local economy.” The United Regional chamber represents businesses in Foxboro and other area communities. “The economic impact will be great,” Foxboro select board vice chair Stephanie McGowan said. “We already know what we get from football, but when you add special events like Army/Navy Game or World Cup games you put Foxboro on a national or global stage. “There is an excitement around town. I expect hotels and restaurants to be booming, bringing in extra revenue to the town,” McGowan said. “While with that excitement comes a bit of strain on the town, mostly traffic, with a knowledge of game dates and times the residents can prepare. The boost in revenue is great for Foxboro.” Planning for the games has already begun. Last summer, Foxboro approved $60,000 to update parking and traffic control along Route 1. There had been a few applications for new satellite parking lots around Gillette Stadium at that time. Foxboro hosted games at the 1994 World Cup, but Gillette is a different venue, built near the old Foxboro Stadium. Foxboro also hosted matches during the 1999 and 2003 Women’s World Cup. Mike Loynd, president of Boston Soccer 26, acknowledged organizers were projecting about five or six matches and no quarterfinal, meaning the final schedule “is a great economic benefit.” “The later in the tournament, the more eyeballs,” he said. “For us, it’s just a matter of excitement ... For us, it’s a perfect schedule. I don’t think FIFA could have done a better job.” Martha Sheridan, president & CEO of Meet Boston, said “nothing compares” to hosting World Cup matches. Sheridan said a FIFA study projected for a city hosting the World Cup would generate $400 million in spending, adding that the number would have to be adjusted now that Boston and its Foxboro suburb is set to host seven games. “Our goal has been for the past four or five years since we were sort of decimated by COVID to really reestablish Boston as a major global destination,” Sheridan told reporters. “We are well on our way to doing that and this event is going to cement our reputation because I know we are going to do such a great job,” she said. “People will be able to share in this incredible city’s reemergence and renaissance. We cannot wait.” Sheridan also said the city will benefit from the fact that games will also be played in Philadelphia and New Jersey — allowing fans to travel by train to various venues. “If you think about the fact that people can come to Boston, stay in a hotel for maybe the whole month and travel back and forth on Amtrak to New York City, Philadelphia and New Jersey and catch games, that’s going to be huge for us,” she said. Brian Bilello, president of the New England Revolution and chair of the board of Boston Soccer 26, said the tournament will also be a boon to soccer in the region. “It solidifies our place in the world’s game in the United States,” Bilello said. “It really cements Boston and Massachusetts as one of the cornerstone soccer hotbeds in this country.” FIFA allocated the opener of the 39-day tournament to Mexico City’s Estadio Azteca and the finale to the home of the NFL’s New York Jets and Giants. FIFA expanded the World Cup from 32 to 48 nations, increased the number of matches to 104 and announced the 16 sites in 2022. With the additional teams, the length of the tournament will grow from 29 days in the shortened 2022 schedule in Qatar and 32 days for the 2018 tournament in Russia. Seventy-eight of 104 matches will be played in the U.S., with 13 games each in Mexico and Canada, and there as many as six matches a day. The U.S. team will train in suburban Atlanta ahead of the tournament and open at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, on June 12, 2026. The Americans play seven days later at Seattle’s Lumen Field and finish the group stage at SoFi on June 25. Paige Duncan, Foxboro’s new town manager who had been director of land use and economic development, wasn’t available for comment Monday. Material from The Associated Press was used in this story.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:28 pm BOSTON — A divided state commission is calling for more aggressive steps to shift Massachusetts away from its reliance on natural gas for energy, but it’s not clear if state lawmakers will take up any of the proposed changes. In a report to the state Legislature, the Gas System Enhancement Working Group takes more steps to shift the state’s utilities away from installing gas infrastructure in the state. In some cases, the changes include only edits of one or two words in the state laws on fixing gas leaks. But the panel, which included state regulators, environmental groups, labor leaders and representatives of utility companies, was unable to reach consensus on many of the proposed regulatory changes. One proposal called for a shift from “replacement” to “repair” of leak-prone natural gas lines, which proponents argued would save ratepayers money and accelerate the state’s transition from fossil fuels to wind, solar and other renewable energy. But the utility panelists voted against it, arguing that it would compromise safety and exceed the working group’s mandate. “A shift in policy that prioritizes repair over replacement does not reduce the risk that leak-prone pipes pose to people, property, and the environment,” they wrote in a summary of the report. “Both cast iron and cathodically unprotected steel will continue to pose concerns as they age.” The panel was created under a 2014 state law that requires utilities to track and grade all gas leaks on a scale of 1 to 3, with 1 being most serious, and immediately repair the most hazardous. The panel’s report noted that Massachusetts gas companies are spending more than $800 million a year installing new gas mains to replace aging leak-prone pipes. The new pipes have a lifespan of 50 years, and will be paid for by energy consumers in the form of higher rates, they noted. But the report’s authors said estimates suggest utilities will spend $34 billion on new gas infrastructure, which won’t be fully paid for until 2097. They noted that as more properties are retrofitted with heat pumps to replace gas, fewer and fewer customers will be on the gas distribution system. “However, that gas system will still have the same number of miles of pipe, with the same fixed maintenance costs,” Audrey Schulman, a panelist and director of the Home Energy Efficiency Team, a Cambridge nonprofit, wrote in a summary of the report. “These maintenance costs will be shouldered by fewer and fewer gas customers, making the customers’ overall gas bills increase.” Schulman said the state is “wasting money and time now by installing long-lived combustion infrastructure, while knowing that combustion is going away.” “Instead we are investing significantly and actively in the gas and electric system at the same time, without thinking through how to synergize the work to reduce the cost and increase the speed,” she wrote. “It is as though we are taking out a mortgage to replace the foundation on our horse’s stable, even after we’ve ordered an electric car,” Schulman added.

become a microcosm of global discord. The recent months have been tumultuous, marked by Claudine Gay’s resignation as University President, the controversial exposure of pro-Palestinian students’ personal details, and relentless advocacy from both pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian factions. Amidst this maelstrom of dissent, Harvard’s prestigious position in the national and international spotlight magnifies every nuance of the debate. This backdrop made the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum’s discussion at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics on dissent and democracy an especially fitting way to kick off its Spring 2024 programming. Harvard’s landscape is a battleground of opinions, underscored by a unique blend of academic fervor and political activism. Yet, amidst this division, a consensus emerges: there is an urgent need to elevate the quality of discourse on campus. Balancing the sanctity of free speech with the principles of effective academic inquiry becomes a challenge too essential to ignore. The Forum’s discussion, on January 25th, featured six intellectual heavy-weights from the Kennedy School’s faculty. They shared findings from their research and personal experiences on the importance of fostering productive disagreement in democracies generally, and Harvard specifically. However, the Forum notably fell short of offering convincing solutions to these challenging issues. Instead, the speakers mostly provided guidance on how individuals might engage in more constructive one-on-one dialogues, highlighting the personal responsibility in fostering better communication. Professor Cornell Brooks, who formerly served as president of the NAACP and is an ordained minister, focused his remarks on the three pillars he abides by when engaging in difficult conversations. First, especially when trauma is involved, genuine dialogue demands mutual respect and good faith. To establish this trust, one must focus on the feelings involved, especially grief and/or trauma, before discussing public policy. His second pillar clarified, though, that experiencing traumatic effects of bad policy must not be considered a prerequisite for talking about the policy—personal experience does not provide a right to silence others. “If you’ve been stopped, as I have, 25 to 30 times by the police without getting a ticket for the crime of driving while Black, walking while Black, maybe I have an epistemological advantage—maybe—in terms of understanding policing at a certain level,” Brooks said. “But I don’t have an epistemological monopoly.” Third, Brooks argued against engaging in performative speech. He suggested instead to trust one’s power of persuasion—to enter hard conversations with the purpose of making an impact on the other person and to engage for long enough to achieve one. While beneficial for personal engagement on contentious issues, student perspectives indicate that meaningful change requires substantial institutional action in addition to individual action. At Harvard, where isolation from opposing viewpoints is challenging, one-on-one dialogues across differing perspectives happen but are insufficient to significantly improve campus discourse. Violet Barron ’26, a Social Studies concentrator in Adams House, is a member of Jews for Palestine—an anti-Zionist group on campus formed in the aftermath of the October 7th attacks—and is currently facing disciplinary action before the Ad Board for having occupied University Hall with eight other students in November. One of her close friends is pro-Israel, and the conflict invariably arises in conversation. While she thinks this helps her protect against falling into an echo chamber, she wishes there were also opportunities for more structured dialogue. “I know there’s no organizational level dialogue between students with very different views, which just has to be a bad thing,” she said. “Everyone, including myself, has their qualms with Harvard, but I think it could be, perhaps, the most nonpartisan way to get such a space off the ground.” Alex Bernat ’25, a Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering concentrator in Lowell House, agrees with Barron on the need for and use of dialogue, though he holds very different views on the Israel-Palestinian conflict. He has been involved in efforts on campus to draw attention to the plight of the hostages still being held by Hamas, the group that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2006 and which organized the October 7th attacks. “I consider myself a free speech absolutist, but do worry about time, place, and manner,” he said. Some pro-Palestinian protests have disrupted classes, which he condemned as a threat to academic inquiry. He hopes that the administration does more to facilitate productive dialogue on campus, perhaps by hosting public conversations between faculty members with strongly pro-Israel views and those with strongly pro-Palestine views. Despite widespread dissatisfaction with the performance of the Harvard community during the tumultuous last few months, doing better is no simple task. “There is a real hunger for being able to marry protection of free expression and mutual respect,” University Professor Danielle Allen said at the Forum. “It’s a ‘how’ question, not a ‘whether’ question.” Jude Herwitz ’25 (jherwitz@college.harvard.edu) is faster than 99% of players on Sudoko.com, at medium difficulty. 05.02.24: Curtain Call, News 05.02.24: Curtain Call, News 05.02.24: Curtain Call, News Is there a topic you think we should cover?

Donald Trump está prometiendo, una vez más, derogar y reemplazar la Ley de Cuidado de Salud a Bajo Precio (ACA), una meta vaga que se convirtió en uno de los fracasos más llamativos de su administración. «Vamos a luchar por un cuidado de salud mucho mejor que el Obamacare. Obamacare es una catástrofe», dijo Trump en una parada de la campaña en Iowa el 6 de enero. Mantente informado con los temas más relevantes de política, economía, comunidad latina y salud. Suscríbete aquí a nuestros newsletters. El desconcertante resurgimiento de una de las cruzadas políticas más perjudiciales de Trump ocurre en un momento en el que la ley de salud de la era Obama es más popular y más utilizada que en 2017, cuando Trump y los republicanos del Congreso demostraron ser incapaces de aprobar su propio plan para reemplazarla. Ese esfuerzo fallido fue en gran parte la razón por la cual los republicanos perdieron el control de la Cámara de Representantes en las elecciones de medio término de 2018. A pesar de las promesas repetidas, Trump nunca presentó su propio plan para reemplazar el Obamacare. Y gran parte de lo que la administración Trump logró en materia de atención médica lo revirtió la administración Biden. Sin embargo, Trump logró algunos cambios de política significativos que todavía hoy están vigentes, incluidos los esfuerzos para brindar más transparencia a los precios que cobran los hospitales y pagan las aseguradoras de salud. Intentar pronosticar las prioridades de Trump en un segundo mandato es aún más difícil ya que cambia frecuentemente de posición sobre los temas, y lo hace muchas veces. La campaña de Trump no respondió a una solicitud de comentario. Quizás el logro más grande de Trump es algo de lo que rara vez habla en su campaña. La «Operation Warp Speed», durante su administración, logró crear, probar y llevar al mercado una vacuna contra covid-19 en menos de un año, mucho más rápido de lo que vaticinaron incluso las predicciones más optimistas. Sin embargo, muchos de los seguidores de Trump no apoyan, e incluso se oponen con fuerza, a estas vacunas. La siguiente es una lista de los “antecedentes” de Trump sobre la atención de salud. La respuesta de Trump a la pandemia domina su historial general en esta área. Más de 400,000 estadounidenses murieron por covid durante el último año de Trump en el cargo. Sus prohibiciones de viaje y otros esfuerzos para evitar la propagación global del virus fueron ineficaces, su administración fue más lenta que otros gobiernos en desarrollar una prueba diagnóstica y confrontó públicamente con funcionarios de salud de su propio gobierno sobre estas respuestas. Antes de las elecciones de 2020, Trump reanudó grandes mitines y otros eventos públicos de campaña que muchos expertos en salud pública consideraron imprudentes frente a un virus altamente contagioso y mortal. Él mismo desafió personalmente las pautas de salud pública después de contraer covid y terminar hospitalizado. Al mismo tiempo, a pesar de lo que muchos vieron como una politización de la salud pública por parte de la Casa Blanca, Trump firmó un gran proyecto de ley de ayuda contra covid (después de amenazar con vetarlo). También presidió algunos de los mayores aumentos en el presupuesto de los Institutos Nacionales de Salud (NIH) en este siglo. Y las vacunas basadas en ARNm desarrolladas por la “Operation Warp Speed” fueron un asombroso avance científico al que se le atribuye haber salvado millones de vidas y sentar las bases para futuras vacunas contra otras enfermedades, incluido el cáncer. La mayor “contribución” de Trump a la política del aborto fue indirecta: nombró a tres jueces de la Corte Suprema que fueron fundamentales para revocar el derecho constitucional al aborto. Durante su campaña de 2024, Trump tomado partido en el candente tema. Desde que la Corte Suprema revocó Roe v. Wade en 2022, Trump se ha lamentado que el tema ha sido políticamente perjudicial para los republicanos; criticó a uno de sus rivales, el gobernador de Florida Ron DeSantis, por firmar una prohibición del aborto a las seis semanas de embarazo; y prometió negociar un compromiso con «ambos lados» sobre el aborto, prometiendo que «por primera vez en 52 años, tendremos un problema que podremos dejar atrás». Hasta ahora, ha evitado explicar cómo lo haría, o si apoyaría una prohibición nacional del aborto más allá del número de semanas. Sin embargo, hace poco, Trump parece haber limado asperezas sobre su crítica a la prohibición de seis semanas en Florida y con importantes opositores al aborto, cuyo apoyo lo ayudó a ser elegido en 2016, y a quienes devolvió el favor con una larga lista de cambios de política durante su presidencia. Entre las acciones contra el aborto llevadas a cabo por la administración Trump estuvo la reinstalación de la «Mexico City Policy» que prohíbe otorgar fondos federales a organizaciones internacionales que respaldan los derechos al aborto. Esta regulación apuntó a evitar que Planned Parenthood y otras entidades que ofrecen abortos participen en el programa federal de planificación familiar llamado Título X; y estableció regulaciones destinadas a facilitar que los proveedores de atención médica y los empleadores se negaran a participar en actividades que violaran sus creencias religiosas y morales; y otros cambios que dificultaron a los científicos de los NIH realizar investigaciones utilizando tejido fetal de abortos electivos. Todas esas normas han sido revertidas por la administración de Biden. A diferencia de las políticas de Trump sobre salud reproductiva, muchas de las acciones de su administración relacionadas con el seguro médico aún están vigentes. Por ejemplo, en 2020, Trump promulgó el No Surprises Act, una medida bipartidista destinada a proteger a los pacientes de facturas médicas inesperadas derivadas de disputas por pagos entre proveedores de atención médica y aseguradoras. La ley se incluyó en el paquete de ayuda contra covid de $900 mil millones que Trump rechazó antes de firmar, aunque expresó su apoyo para poner fin a las facturas médicas sorpresa. Su administración también impulsó —a pesar de las vehementes objeciones de funcionarios de la industria de salud—, regulaciones de transparencia de precios que requieren que los hospitales publiquen lo que cobran por servicios, y que las aseguradoras proporcionen costos estimados para procedimientos. Esos requisitos aún están en vigor, aunque los hospitales en particular han sido lentos en cumplirlos. Aunque Trump prometió no recortar programas de beneficios populares como Medicare, Medicaid y el Seguro Social, su administración no cumplió esa promesa. La legislación para derogar ACA que Trump respaldó en 2017 habría impuesto recortes importantes a Medicaid, y su Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos (HHS) alentó a los estados a exigir a los beneficiarios de Medicaid que demostraran que trabajaban para recibir seguro médico. Uno de los temas en los que la administración Trump fue más activa fue en reducir el precio de los medicamentos recetados para los consumidores, una prioridad principal tanto para votantes demócratas como republicanos. Pero muchos de esos planes se bloquearon en los tribunales. Un plan de la era Trump que nunca se implementó habría vinculado el precio de algunos medicamentos costosos cubiertos por Medicare a los precios en otros países. Otro habría requerido que las compañías farmacéuticas incluyeran los precios en sus anuncios televisivos. Una regulación que permite a los estados importar medicamentos más baratos de Canadá sí entró en vigencia en noviembre de 2020. Sin embargo, la Administración de Drogas y Alimentos (FDA) recién aprobó el plan en enero de 2024, desde Florida. Canadá ha dicho que no permitirá exportaciones que pongan en riesgo la escasez de medicamentos en su país, dejando en duda si la política es viable. Trump también promulgó medidas que permiten a los farmacéuticos informar a los pacientes cuando el precio en efectivo de un medicamento es más bajo que el costo utilizando su seguro. Antes, los farmacéuticos podían tener la prohibición de hacerlo, dependiendo de sus contratos con aseguradoras y administradores de beneficios farmacéuticos. Trump logró una gran victoria para la facción libertaria del Partido Republicano cuando promulgó el «Right to Try Act», destinado a facilitar que los pacientes con enfermedades terminales accedan a medicamentos o tratamientos aún no aprobados por la FDA. Pero no está claro cuántos pacientes han logrado obtener tratamiento utilizando la ley porque está dirigida a la FDA, que tradicionalmente ha otorgado solicitudes de «uso compasivo» de medicamentos aún no aprobados. El obstáculo, que la ley no aborda, es conseguir que las compañías farmacéuticas liberen dosis de medicamentos que aún se están probando y que pueden ser escasos. Trump dijo en un foro de Fox News el 10 de enero que la ley había «salvado miles y miles» de vidas. No hay evidencia que respalde esa afirmación.

Biden set the angry tone hours after special counsel Robert Hur’s report was released, dismissing the report’s conclusions about his memory and insisting he hadn’t forgotten the year his son Beau died, as Hur claimed. Democrats on Capitol Hill and around the country quickly followed. “Republicans saying that Biden is old is the least surprising thing in American politics,” Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said. “It’s all they’ve got.” Democrats plan to answer the widespread questions about the 81-year-old president’s age and readiness by affirming that Biden is capable of being commander in chief and trying to discredit people who portray him as enfeebled. Key to that strategy is drawing a core contrast with former President Donald Trump, the heavy Republican front-runner who is himself 77 and has also confused names and facts while also facing four indictments and multiple multimillion-dollar civil judgments. The signs of support are crucial for Biden as he prepares for what could be a tight election against Trump. Even before the report’s release, fears were mounting that the coalition that helped elect Biden in 2020 was fraying, making it all the more important for Biden to keep as many supporters as possible firmly on his side. The Biden campaign circulated talking points to allies that were obtained by The Associated Press. The talking points refer to Hur, a U.S. attorney during the Trump administration, as a “MAGA-appointed attorney who doesn’t have a case so he decided to lob personal attacks against the president.” That’s a reference to “Make America Great Again,” Trump’s political movement. The talking points also stressed that Hur is “a lawyer — not a doctor — so people should take his legal conclusions and ignore his political opinions.” The White House has also noted Biden cooperated with Hur, who declined to charge him with unlawfully retaining classified documents, while Trump faces an indictment in Florida after the FBI seized records from his Mar-a-Lago residence. “The way that the president’s demeanor in that report was characterized could not be more wrong on the facts and clearly politically motivated, gratuitous,” Vice President Kamala Harris said Friday. “I will say that when it comes to the role and responsibility of a prosecutor in a situation like that, we should expect that there would be a higher level of integrity than what we saw.” Indignation spread into South Carolina, where Biden scored a commanding victory in the first-in-the-nation Democratic primary on Feb. 3, which was designed by his campaign to project clear strength. Some saw Biden’s forceful response to the special counsel as a promising sign. “I truly believe this is bringing the best out in the president. It’s showing that he’s a fighter,” said LaJoia Broughton, a 42-year-old small-business owner in Columbia who voted for Biden in the primary. Biden aides say they do not expect the president or his campaign to take on the age question more directly. They can’t make Biden any younger, and note that attacks on the president over his age were also persistent four years ago, when Trump labeled him “Sleepy Joe.” Instead, they intend to draw on the blueprint of the 2020 campaign and argue many voters won’t want a repeat of Trump’s turbulent time in the White House. They also plan to highlight Biden’s accomplishments and an economy that continues to show strength. “The president has said that age is a fair question on voters’ minds, but if you’re an independent or pursuable voter across this country and you’re worried about your kid facing gun violence while going to school, the prospect a national abortion ban, or the future of our democracy, you may think about the president’s age, but at the end of the day the choice is easy,” said Kate Berner, a former deputy communications director in the Biden White House. “Donald Trump is on the wrong side of all of those issues.” Some Democrats weren’t so optimistic. “This is a distraction. When you’re running a presidential campaign, you don’t like distractions,” said Jim Messina, who led former President Barack Obama’s last campaign. Messina compared the special counsel’s report to the announcement in October 2016 by then- FBI Director James Comey that he was further investigating Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified emails when she was secretary of state. Comey’s announcement, which came 11 days before the election, has been blamed for helping Trump beat Clinton. In this case, this week’s report comes more than nine months before Election Day. “There’s just so much time to get through all this,” Messina said. “Trump has all the trials coming up. I’d be surprised if this was an issue in a month.” Still, Trump’s allies were emboldened this week. Beyond celebrating the release of the special counsel’s embarrassing descriptions of Biden, Trump won a new trove of delegates in Nevada’s Thursday caucuses, where he ran unopposed. “We all already know that Joe Biden is senile. What’s being lost is that Joe Biden is a criminal who put American national security at risk,” Donald Trump Jr. wrote in one of many messages highlighting the new report. Barry Goodman, a Biden fundraiser from Michigan, said he’s had some donors “take a wait and see approach” about supporting Biden, even before the special counsel’s announcement. “They wanted to see if someone else would get in or whether Trump would drop out — but no one else is getting in,” Goodman said. “Of everyone I talk to, some are more excited than others.” Still, Goodman said the report did nothing to shake his support for Biden. Trav Robertson, a former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman, described the report as an obvious political liability for Biden. But he directed blame squarely at Attorney General Merrick Garland for allowing the report to include comments about the president’s age, memory and cognitive function. “Merrick Garland not doing his job only allowed a Trump appointee to feed a political narrative to deflect from Trump,” Robertson said, adding, “Donald Trump can’t lift a glass of water to his lips without using both hands because he’s old.” Indeed, Biden’s allies were eager to highlight a perceived double standard as Biden’s gaffes get far more attention than those of other leading politicians. Trump repeatedly confused former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Republican rival Nikki Haley in recent weeks. Biden didn’t help himself, of course, by referring to the Egyptian leader as the president of Mexico late Thursday. “There’s a clear unfairness there that people feel,” Rep.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:33 pm CONCORD — The source responsible for sending out AI-generated robocalls telling people not to vote in the Jan. 23 New Hampshire presidential primary has been identified. An investigation found an individual named Walter Monk and Texas-based Life Corporation were behind sending New Hampshire residents a message that sounded like President Joe Biden, telling them not to vote on primary day, but rather save their vote for the November election. The Attorney General’s Office identified the source after conducting an investigation into the calls in coordination with state and federal partners, including a bipartisan task force of all the 50 state attorneys general. Investigators say between 5,000 and 25,000 robocalls were made on Jan. 21 to voters with the exact number of recipients still being determined, the Attorney General’s Office said. Residents received a phone call a few days before the primary saying, “It’s important that you save your vote for the November election,” or “Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday.” The fake call also illegally used the caller identification number of the chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, the investigation found. The New Hampshire Election Law Unit worked with the Anti-Robocall Multistate Litigation Task Force on the matter. They traced the calls back to Monk. Additional call tracking found a different Texas-based company called Lingo Telecom, a voice service provider, originated the robocall traffic. The Federal Communications Commission has since issued a cease-and-desist order to Lingo Telecom for allegedly generating the call traffic which used voice cloning to spread misinformation ahead of the election. Additionally, the Election Law Unit issued a cease-and-desist order to Life Corporation for knowingly engaging in voter suppression and attempting to deter people from voting. “Ensuring public confidence in the electoral process is vital,” N.H. Attorney General John Formella said. “AI-generated recordings used to deceive voters have the potential to have devastating effects on the democratic election process.” The investigation is ongoing to find out if others were involved in the robocalls.

Where can you go to find avant-garde abstract work? Where can you find striking photorealist images? Where can you discover contemporary paintings with an emotional impact you never expected?

Aren’t those paintings usually wet and misty scenic pastels with soft edges and a moody atmosphere? Not here. The painters of these works are the cream of the crop: each has been juried into at least four selective exhibitions to earn the Society’s top designation. And they treat the watercolor medium in ways you probably never imagined. Judging by the works in this show, they are an unruly band. There are sharply defined paintings of astonishing precision and there are wild and stormy pieces that nevertheless cohere unexpectedly into images of an eagle or a mountain range. There’s a ghostly scene in which beautiful children step out of a background shrouded in mist, and there’s a face-to-face confrontation with a herd of llamas in, of all places, Addison, Maine. Yes, there are boats, but not the kind you imagine when someone says “watercolor.” One looks as if it had trespassed into a Barnett Newman color field painting; others have brilliant sails that might have been dipped in Klimt’s burnished gold. Eighty-nine artists from all over New England are represented in the show. All the paintings are for sale, most at prices within reach of art lovers without trust funds. Show chairperson Kristin Stashenko observed, “This show is an extraordinary display of the breadth and versatility of the medium and the technical expertise of the artists. The range of styles from realism to abstract will delight all, from the casual observer to the sophisticated art connoisseur. There is something for everyone!” This year’s exhibition judge, who chose the paintings for the Society’s prestigious awards, is Michael Holter, a signature member of the American Watercolor Society, the National Watercolor Society, and other national organizations. The exhibit runs until Feb. 25. As part of the society’s commitment to education, award-winning member artists will give free painting demonstrations on weekends. The society, which traces its history to 1885 and numbers such figures as John Singer Sargent, Childe Hassam, Andrew Wyeth, and Ruth Wynn among its past luminaries, today claims nearly 200 signature members and an overall membership of more than 400.
