Eddie Greene Jr.’s mother Wilma Yount, right, and sister Stacy Igo hold up a photo of Greene during a news conference on Friday. Four men have been charged with Greene’s murder nearly 15 years after Greene was killed in Long View. Four men have been charged with murder and robbery in connection with the killing of a 26-year-old masonry business owner who was found shot to death in his work van in 2008. The four defendants — 33-year-old Jamar Quarmaine Propst, 33-year-old Pierre Demond Ramseur, 31-year-old Emandalae Diontae Tolbert and 37-year-old Anthony Maurice Tucker — are all charged with murder in the death of Eddie Greene Jr. The four men also face charges of robbery with a dangerous weapon and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon. Propst and Ramseur were taken into custody by Long View officers and N.C. State Bureau of Investigation personnel on Thursday. The two made brief court appearances on Friday. Defendant Jamar Propst answers questions from Catawba County District Court Judge Scott Conrad during his first appearance in court on Friday. Propst is one of four men charged in the 2008 murder of Eddie Greene Jr. Tucker is currently incarcerated in Virginia on an unrelated charge while Tolbert was arrested by federal marshals in Detroit, Michigan, Long View Police Chief T.J. Bates said during a news conference Friday. Ramseur and Propst are listed as Hickory residents on the jail website. Bates said Tucker was also from the area and that Tolbert lived in the area before moving to Michigan. Bates said the department spent years investigating the case with the help of the SBI but that at one point the case went cold. He said he decided to reopen the investigation in April 2020. “Criminal charges in this investigation demonstrate that justice has no time limit and today we are one step closer for justice for Eddie,” Bates said. Defendant Pierre Ramseur looks back toward his family during his first appearance in Catawba County District Court on Friday. Ramseur is one of four charged in the 2008 murder of Eddie Greene Jr. Bates said the motive for the killing was robbery but did not elaborate on what was stolen. He said Greene knew at least one of the four men charged in the murder. Tolbert Tucker Greene’s mother, Wilma Yount. and sister, Stacy Igo, embraced at the podium and shed tears as they spoke during Friday’s news conference. At one point, they held up a framed photo of Greene. “He was my baby and he didn’t mind telling anyone he was my baby,” Yount said. “Our life’s torn terribly. It’s not been the same since we lost him.” Yount described Eddie as a hard worker and generous person who at one time agreed to lay pipe so that a needy neighbor could connect to county water services. Regarding the men charged in Greene’s murder, Yount said, “I hope and pray that these people get what’s coming to them.” A family member of one of the defendants in the case also spoke briefly on Friday. Long View Police Chief T.J Bates, right, addresses the family of Eddie Greene Jr. after announcing murder charges in Greene's 2008 death during a news conference Friday. As she was leaving the courtroom, Slim Propst, wife of Jamar Propst, said he was innocent of the charges and that she was shocked by his arrest. Slim Propst was accompanied by three young children she has with Jamar. Even with the arrests, Bates said the department is still accepting any tips related to the case.

The 71-year-old actor took on the title role of the superhero in the 1989 film directed by Tim Burton and returned to star in its 1992 sequel \'Batman Returns\' but explained that he believed his own views on the character would not make the final cut because he couldn\'t imagine anyone wanting to see him portrayed in that way. He told Empire: ""I remember exactly where we were. He said, \'I wanna talk to you about something… I just want you to read this, because I think I\'m gonna make this movie\' What\'s interesting if you think about this is that up until then, his and my relationship was only \'Beetlejuice\'. So there was something, I don\'t know that I\'ve ever asked him this, actually, but something gave him the idea and so he said, \'go home and read it. ""I said, \'Well, no one\'s going to do what I think, this is probably not going to happen, because I can\'t imagine anyone would want to make the movie that I see\' and all I said, \'listen to me Tim.\' And I started to go down the list of the guy, Bruce Wayne with him, my take on him and he didn\'t say anything but his hair was long at the time and I could see it moving as he nodded, \'yes… yes… Exactly.\' He\'s a rare breed, a true artist and a true original. He was already seeing it and it was basically the Frank Miller stuff. And I wasn\'t aware of all that stuff, I just knew what it was, but I knew I had to read the Miller stuff. And I thought, \'oh, this could be interesting.\'"" Michael added that his vision of the Bruce Wayne character was as having a ""depressed"" nature and recalled that Tim complied with the idea to his surprise. He said: ""He\'s depressed. I wasn\'t really committing to it because I didn\'t know what he\'d say. Actually, I don\'t know I thought he might say but if I was saying it to a studio exec, they\'d say, \'I don\'t know if he\'s really depressed… I\'m not so sure…\' I was sweating bullets and Tim said, \'Oh yeah, for sure.\' We also thought he was odd, an odd dude, which was fun."" Mel B is still trying to ""build herself back up"" from her marriage to Stephen Belafonte. The 48-year-old pop star was married to the producer from 2007 until 2017 in what she has alleged was an abusive relationship - although he has always denied the claims - and only realised when she managed to get herself out of it just how ""bad"" it was. She told OK! Magazine: ""You\'re told day in day out that you\'re fat, you\'re ugly and that no-one is going to want you. I had that for 10 years, as well as all the other abuse my abuser did to me. ""Your self-esteem and worth are at zero so you have to build yourself back up, which I\'m still doing to this day. Looking back, it was only when I got out of that relationship that I realised how bad it had all been, and then I had to embark on getting myself back to how I was before I was married."" The Spice Girls star - who was known as Scary Spice during her time in the 1990s girl group alongside Geri Halliwell, Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton and Melanie C - is now engaged to hairdresser Rory McPhee and explained how she has turned to fitness for the sake of her mental wellbeing. She added: ""At the start of January, I gave myself a proper New Year\'s resolution that I really stuck to and gave my lifestyle a complete turnaround. I made sure I was getting enough sleep, meaning I now go to bed at 9.30pm during the week and wake up at the same time every day. ""Weekends are different because I still like to socialise and I like to have a Sunday dinner. I\'ve been doing weights too. I committed myself to doing a really good weights workout twice a week, and some long dog walks. I\'ve been sticking to it and have seen my body shape get back to how it used to be. ""I\'m focusing on my mental health too, making sure I\'m doing some mindfulness and some yoga just to give my brain a good clear out of all the crap that I\'ve accumulated over the years."" Black Sabbath star Geezer Butler had to cut out ""at least 50 pages"" from his memoirs for legal reasons. The 73-year-old rocker is best known for being part of the heavy metal band alongside Tony Iommi, Bill Ward and Ozzy Osbourne and explained that when writing his memoir \'Into the Void\' - which is due to be released on June 6 - that the ""original manuscript was deemed unsuitable for modern readers"" and he was forced to omit some of its content when lawyers descended upon the publishing house. He told The Sunday Times: ""At least 50 pages of them [had to go]! I had this whole thing back from them, \'You can\'t say this; you can\'t say that. I said, \'I was with Black Sabbath, not the Osmonds.\' "" Geezer - whose real name is Terence - also explains in the book that the band ended up stealing various items from gigs and selling them for scrap metal after firing band manager Patrick Meehan and finding themselves without a great deal of cash despite signing a massive record deal. He said: ""God knows how much Warner Brothers advanced for the albums. Apparently, it was one of the biggest amounts of money ever in the record business. All we wanted to do was play music."" Meanwhile, the \'Sweat Leaf\' hitmaker endured a nervous breakdown in 1998 just after the band had got back together and went on to add that all these years later he is unable to really enjoy anything nor feel any ""misery"" towards anything because of the medication he is on. He said; ""I think it\'s probably because of the antidepressants I\'m on. You can\'t get really excited about anything. but you can\'t get miserable about anything."" \'\'Into the Void: From Birth to Black Sabbath and Beyond\' is due to be released on Thursday 8 June. Britney Spears says she has gained weight. The 41-year-old pop star took to social media on Sunday (04.06.23) to share a video of herself dancing around to the Janet Jackson hit \'All Nite (Don\'t Stop)\' where she wore white knee-high boots, turquoise bikini bottoms and white crop top and noted in the caption - which was initially in Spanish - that she has put on a few founds but is now able to ""move her butt"" all day. She captioned the post: ""I gained weight, but at least I have butt now and can move it all day!"" The \'...Baby One More Time\' hitmaker - who regained control of her multimillion dollar fortune and various aspects of her life since a conservatorship that had been governed by her family for over a decade was terminated in November 2021 - recently took to social media to seemingly deny rumours that she had had a breast enhancement in the early days of her career. Alongside a throwback snap of herself in a bra, Britntey - who has sons Sean, 17, and 16-year-old Jayden with ex-husband Kevin Federline but is now married to actor Sam Asghari - wrote on Instagram: ""Only shoot I ever did in the woods !!! Way back before I had kids. only thing I remember is my stylist saying \'Uhhhhhhhhhhh !!! Your boobs Britney … they\'re huge what happened ???\' I said I have no idea [shrugging emoji!"" Just weeks ago, the \'Toxic\' singer was reunited with her mother Lynne after years of not speaking amid the conservatorship battle. Sources told TMZ that Lynne was driven from LAX airport to the home of Britney\'s manager, Cade Hudson, and from there took an Uber to her daughter\'s home. Insiders told the outlet that ""the ice between mother and daughter is thawing"" and the pair had exchanged text messages before Lynne came to visit. The source added: ""Lynne is committed to making it right with her daughter."" After her mom left, Britney and her husband took a short drive before returning home. Niecy Nash gets bombarded with requests for therapy sessions. The 53-year-old actress features in the TV series \'Never Have I Ever\' as therapist Dr. Jamie Ryan and admits that fans are unable to separate fiction from reality. Niecy told Entertainment Tonight: ""Oh, let me tell you something, everybody wants it. They\'re all in my DMs, asking me what I think. I said, \'Listen, I play a therapist on TV. Everybody relax.\' ""Here\'s the thing, I go to therapy so I do have'}]"

To top it all off, the Masonic Picnic was going on that week and she took him to the picnic even though, get this, even though she had a boyfriend and as far as she knows he didn’t see her. That night was the last time she saw that lifeguard. All she could say was, “He was so good looking.” I guess most people at the age of 18 do crazy things and have fun telling about it. This woman has been carrying around this story for a long time and now the cat is out of the bag. Names have been kept secret to bring a little mystery about who of the five told the story. You’ll have to decide. Before parting ways they unanimously voted Cosby Beach Trip for the name of this getaway. Looking forward to many more. Pease contact me at www.cooleemeenews@gmail.com, 336.250.1133, I would love to hear from you but, I’ll never tell who.'}]"

News Kernersville Police Chief Tim Summers has announced that he will be retiring from the Kernersville Police Department (KPD) in the very near future. The Town will begin its search for a new police chief, and as soon as that is concluded, Summers will retire. He expects it to be in mid- to late-May or June and stated he would be as involved in the hiring process “as much as the town manager needs me to be.” Summers will have served in the KPD for over 31 years when he retires. Summers replaced former KPD Chief Scott Cunningham. Cunningham was named KPD chief in June 2008 and served until Jan. 31, 2017. Summers’ first official day as KPD chief was Feb. 1, 2017. “This is one of the toughest decisions I have had to make as far as a lifestyle decision because I worked for so many good people in the past and I work with so many good people currently,” Summers said. “The unfortunate truth is in the police department you are kind of forced into retirement with the way it works. Once you get to 30 years, you have to start thinking hard about how much longer you are going to stay because the retirement is affected by everything you do. It has been a great job. Every year goes by faster. It has been very rewarding. I did not get here on my own. A lot of people were responsible for getting me in the role as a chief, and I owe it all to them.” Summers is originally from Kansas City, Missouri. He moved to Kernersville because he had family here and quickly grew to love the town. He has been married for 31 years and has two daughters. “Obviously, I am biased. Kernersville is the greatest community in North Carolina, but that is not to say we don’t have our issues,” said Summers. Summers actually started his career in the KPD as a dispatcher. “There were a lot of people that wanted to join the KPD then. There were only two police department spots open. Those got taken by veteran officers from other police departments, so I took the dispatcher position until something was open,” Summers said. Summers was a dispatcher for nine months and then was part of the KPD Patrol Division for four years. He joined the KPD Narcotics Division in 1997 and stayed there for six years. In 2003, he became a detective in the Criminal Investigation Division and stayed there for five years. He was promoted to lieutenant of the Narcotics Division in 2008 and was later promoted to captain. Summers has an associates degree in criminal justice and has received numerous awards and certificates during his time on the force, including his Advanced Law Enforcement Certificate and his Criminal Investigation Certificate. He has also received a Master Certification Service Award and a Tactical Award for his performance on the job. In addition, Summers has received multiple Commendation Awards for Exceptional Meritorious Service. Summers never expected to be the KPD chief, but he had the support of many in the department and had two excellent role models in former KPD Chief Neal Stockton and Cunningham. Stockton was the KPD chief from 1984 to 2009. “I was never expecting to be the chief at all. I think I applied for it because of everyone at the KPD that wanted me to be the chief. I would say I was brought up under and hired by Chief Stockton. He promoted me to lieutenant. Cunningham promoted me to captain and assisted me with the chief of police process and really showed me how the administrative side of law enforcement works,” said Summers. A team-oriented police department has been part of Summers’ and the KPD’s success over the years. “It is a good department that strives to work with the community and partner with the community. I think that it is a team environment that we have really worked hard to cultivate. As the chief, I know I can make decisions, but it is the team dynamic that I feel works best for the department and the Town where we roundtable a lot of the problems and the solutions. I enjoy being a police officer, but like any other profession you have good and bad,” Summers said. “You are not going to make everybody happy. Most of the time when people are dealing with the police they are not having their best day, but I think that is where we empathize with people and make it work. A lot of it is about solving crimes and preventing crimes, but it is about serving the community just as much.” Summers also praised the school resource officers’ (SRO) contributions. “We have an excellent SRO program that provides a service. It is not just being at the schools as officers, but being educators as well,” Summers said. Summers’ approach to law enforcement is reflected by the advice he gives to new officers. “I always tell my new hires the community deserves to be treated well and they are the ones that make or break the police department. I tell them to be nice until it is time not to be nice. Everybody accepts the culture of the police department, for example like with stopping cars. No one likes having their car stopped, but I don’t want everybody who gets stopped to get a ticket. I want them to get warnings sometimes, but obviously if someone deserves a ticket, then give them a ticket,” said Summers. Summers has greatly appreciated the support of the community, Town government and other entities. “You are always going to have some people that hate the police, but I think 90% of the people in Kernersville support us. I would like to say something about the Board of Aldermen (BOA) and previous BOAs that have been so supportive of the KPD and me. (Town Manager) Curtis Swisher has been one of the greatest bosses I have worked for, but I have been fortunate in my career to work for a lot of good people,” Summers said. Summers also praised John Owensby, who was the managing editor/publisher of the Kernersville News from 1986 until his death on Nov. 4, 2022, for his support over the years. “John was on the board to select the police chief. He really supported me as the chief of police and always gave me the opportunity to showcase the department,” said Summers. Summers has seen much in his years in law enforcement and has faced various challenges as a police officer and as the KPD chief. Some of the changes have been good, and some of them not so much. “The personnel have changed. You don’t have the career dedication with law enforcement that we once had. Obviously, hiring right now is a challenge trying to stay fully staffed,” said Summers. “Fully staffed, we are at 71 and we have 19 civilian employees. We are about five to seven short right now, which is about 10%. Some of the bigger departments are 20% down. Staffing is an issue for everybody right now. That is an internal working challenge.” He continued. “Obviously, staying up-to-date with trends and technology is paramount as well so we don’t fall behind and so our service to the community is what it should be and more. You have to keep up with the crime trends and business and commercial issues, where people are stealing or defrauding businesses, and residential issues where people are targeting communities or families. You have scams targeting individuals. You have drug trends. People are worrying about fentanyl, heroin and overdoses. It is the deadliest trend we are seeing, and with the fentanyl, it is concerning for the safety of the officers as well.” The COVID-19 pandemic was a very unwelcome challenge for everybody, which included the KPD and other police departments and law enforcement agencies. “I guess as chief one of the biggest challenges I faced was the pandemic. Trying to work around and with different protocols and ideologies was a challenge in and of itself. We are still dealing with the court issues. They have not caught up yet from the pandemic,” said Summers. The available technology in law enforcement now is the biggest change, and it has been very helpful. “The technology is consistently changing. We are on the third generation of body cameras. We have the new Real Time Crime Center and we have a drone program. Sometimes with the new technology we are gaining it can make up for other personnel issues we are facing. It can eliminate the need for additional manpower to do the job. For example, the drones have a license plate reader. On one hand the technology is good, so the town manager and the BOA give us the opportunity to acquire technology that is needed for the job. It can cost more upfront, but it pays for itself.” The future after retirement'}]"

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 2:30 am The North Carolina Conservation Network (NC Conservation Network) has a petitioner on campus, located outside Prospector every Monday from 2:30 p.m.-4:30 p.m. and Wednesday and Friday from 11:30 a.m.-1 p.m., urging government officials to stop forever chemicals in N.C. water. Forever chemicals – per or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) – are toxic, persistent chemicals found in stain, grease and water-resistant products. Senior Campaign Organizer Stephanie Schweickert stated, ""Forever chemicals are a giant class of chemicals – like 10,000 chemicals – they are very persistent in the environment and our bodies."" According to fourth-year UNC Charlotte student and NC Conservation Network Campus Fellow Alyse Moffitt, ""They [forever chemicals] bioaccumulate, so once it is in our water, it is very hard to get out since it never breaks down."" Schweickert mentioned some common household products that contain forever chemicals: nonstick pans, raincoats, food packaging and some makeup, especially waterproof makeup. ""When people are exposed to the chemical for a long amount of time, a lot of health effects can occur: kidney, liver and bladder diseases and disorders, vaccine resistance and cancers,"" says Moffitt. Local news stories have reported forever chemicals in some drinking water systems across N.C., with high levels in Cape Fear River. ""It can get into the water from landfills because of these common products and all of the things that end up there; there is leakage from those landfills. That leakage has to go somewhere,"" says Schweickert. While Charlotte\'s water is not as contaminated, other surrounding areas have been identified to contain forever chemicals, such as ""Durham, Pittsboro, Fuquay-Varina, Asheboro, as well as Orange, Johnston and Nash Counties,"" according to the Raleigh news channel, WRAL News. Moffitt and Schweickert mentioned that this started in West Virginia with Dupont, a major chemical company. In 1998, Dupont was sued for doing studies with the Teflon chemical that was being placed into West Virginia\'s water. This led to locals and workers experiencing many health effects. Afterward, DuPont relocated to Fayetteville, N.C., and changed its name to Chemours in 2015. ""In the Fayetteville area and then downstream to Wilmington, [Chemours was] manufacturing forever chemicals and discharging them directly into the Cape Fear River and then also emitting PFAS into the air, where ultimately, they land and end up in groundwater,"" said Schweickert. These acts of pollution from Chemours came to a halt when ""The State required Chemours to end their discharges into the river as well as implement controls to try to stop their air pollution,"" said Schweickert. Although the state required Chemours\' tighter pollution control, other companies and products still manufacture forever chemicals. ""It\'s not just one bad actor [or] one bad company that has contaminated the river,"" said Schweickert. ""There are a variety of industrial sources that [are] putting their waste back into the water stream, and that is not being treated."" The NC Conservation Network, a statewide, nonprofit and non-partisan organization, filed a petition in 2022 to urge Governor Roy Cooper and the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to take action against forever chemicals. ""The petition is really asking the State to do similar work with other polluters and demand that they halt their pollution,"" said Schweickert.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 2:13 am Orange County Sheriff Charles Blackwood A well-known adage holds that only two things are certain - death and taxes. For the sake of this month’s Lowdown, I am adding a third item to that list – vehicle crashes. Almost everyone I know has been in at least one accident as the at-fault driver, a passenger or the motorist who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wrecks can be deadly or painful, they are usually expensive, and they are always inconvenient and stressful. In the immediate aftermath, people generally struggle to remember exactly what they should do. Let’s start at the very beginning: People have a responsibility to themselves and to other motorists to maintain their vehicles properly. Bald tires, inoperable turn signals, worn out brakes, broken taillights, and crumbling wiper blades can all lead to a person causing or being unable to avoid a crash. North Carolina requires a yearly safety inspection to help identify these issues, and a person may not renew a license plate without proof that this assessment is complete, and any problems addressed. Law enforcement officers stop driver for expired tags because an out-of-date sticker signals that a qualified technician has not inspected the vehicle or that the vehicle failed the inspection, and the operator has not corrected the identified problems. Frankly, many people would not maintain their vehicle unless required to do so. Prior to getting behind the wheel, it is generally a good idea for drivers to let someone know where they are going and when they plan to arrive. Ideally, motorists carry safety equipment, including a flashlight, first aid kit and blankets. Many people think they don’t need a jacket because they are taking a quick trip to run a short errand. They feel differently once they’ve waited an hour or more in the cold for a trooper and a tow truck. I mention troopers because in the unincorporated parts of the county, the Highway Patrol investigates traffic crashes on state-maintained roads and in public vehicular areas. My deputies will respond to assist, render aid, or direct traffic, but troopers conduct the crash investigation and write any required reports. The wait times are often long, especially during rain or snow events when multiple collisions typically occur. Although such delays are frustrating, leaving the scene of a crash is against the law. Drivers must report any crash in which someone is injured or killed or property damage of at least $1,000 occurs. If no one seems injured and the property damage appears minimal, one of the parties may suggest handling the matter privately, but I advise against taking this course of action. Vehicles may have hidden damage, people may not realize they are injured, and the other party may provide false information or fail to live up to any roadside agreements. People involved in a collision should do their best to stay calm and proceed carefully. Each driver should assess him or herself and all passengers for injuries, turn on hazard lights, and check to see if it is safe to exit the vehicle. He or she should also heed warnings from witnesses or bystanders – they may see a hazard from their vantage point that the drivers cannot, such as downed power lines, fluid leaks, or oncoming traffic. Witnesses may realize an involved party is seriously hurt, but because of adrenalin or shock, the injured person may not feel pain yet. Once out of the car, all parties should check on others involved in the crash, help uninjured people navigate away from the scene, call for help, and try to alert other motorists. Crash scenes are dangerous places — many wrecks are followed by additional collisions, either in a chain reaction, or because other drivers fail to successfully navigate around the scene of the crash. North Carolina has a fender bender law that requires motorists to move vehicles to the side of the road and out of the path of nearby traffic if it is safe to do so and no one is seriously injured. Although drivers should comply with this law as soon as they can, taking a cell phone photo of the crash before moving the vehicles may be advisable. I encourage everyone to remind themselves frequently that driving is a privilege and a tremendous responsibility. Approach the task with respect and caution and do not operate a vehicle under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Follow applicable laws, avoid distractions, use common sense, and be courteous. I wish everyone safe travels and a healthy 2024. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular images. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

The horrors of war on and off the battlefield are nuanced and far-reaching. In February 2022, Army veteran Makari Smith of Granville County died following a police shooting. Smith’s mother called law enforcement during her son’s mental breakdown stemming from his combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder. Following her 911 call, Smith’s mother left the home to get an involuntary commitment order for him as a measure to address his mental health issues. During her absence, Smith was shot by police and later died at the hospital. It's a tragic and preventable situation for both law enforcement and the families of struggling veterans. The National Center for PTSD estimates that 11% to 20% of veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from PTSD. Additionally, the Pew Charitable Trust completed a survey noting that 36% of post-9/11 veterans surveyed indicated that they suffer from PTSD.

Less than half of these veterans seek medical or mental health treatment, according to the RAND Center for Military Health Policy Research, and many experience crisis without knowing how to adequately address their needs. We can no longer sit back and share sad statistics. Instead, we must take steps to reduce this heartbreaking reality. These facts compelled me to support the No Veteran Left Behind bill to North Carolina’s General Assembly in 2021.

The bill passed with unanimous, bipartisan support in a victory for veterans statewide. In partnership with the state of North Carolina, through NVLB, The Independence Fund’s Veterans Justice Initiative program is making a sweeping impact in law enforcement agencies across our 100 counties. VJI addresses the unique and severe mental health needs faced by veterans, particularly post-9/11 combat veterans through specific training for veterans in crisis for North Carolina law enforcement and first responder agencies. VJI’s approach is comprehensive, from a veteran’s initial contact through any necessary legal processes. Importantly, the program establishes a strong aftercare plan through an extensive network of resources and partner organizations to help a veteran find healing and hope beyond their crisis. The full scope of veterans’ mental health needs are vast, and VJI’s robust, alternative approach to veterans in crises will help law enforcement, first responders, and front-line workers understand the nuance necessary to prevent future conflict and ultimately save lives. While VJI isn’t a carte blanche opportunity for Veterans to engage in misconduct, it does provide a platform for veterans and law enforcement to build camaraderie thanks to their mutual service to their nation. Makari Smith’s tragic death shines a spotlight on the emergent needs of veterans across the state. His life was one marked by courage and heroism, and his death will serve as a reminder that the war is hard-fought overseas and domestically. The Independence Fund remains motivated to bring VJI to every county in North Carolina to save lives of our nation’s dedicated heroes who have already paid an immense price for our freedom.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 2:30 am On Oct. 23, Charlotte council members approved (8-2 vote) Plaza Midwood Merchants Association\'s (PMMA) application for a social district intended to operate seven days a week from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. and planned to open in March 2024. The social district will be a designated area for patrons to consume alcoholic beverages and publicly walk around with open drinks. According to PMMA Board Member, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission Vice-Chair and Plaza Midwood resident Phillip Gussman, ""The intent [in March] is to roll out slowly to a small number of member organizations that will allow us to get our feet wet, test the process because we are doing something different with the sustainable cup solution."" ""The district is located from Louise Avenue/10th Street to Morningside Drive along Central Avenue in the east/west directions and will run from Chesterfield Avenue to near Hamorton Place along Pecan Avenue in the north/south direction,"" according to the City Council Business meeting agenda. PMMA partnered with Innovation Barn to meet the city\'s request for a sustainable cup solution. This prompted designated reusable steel cups to hold beverages purchased from participating businesses and encourage sustainability practices. ""We haven\'t completely nailed down the pricing on the cup, but it\'s going to be between $5-$8, and that\'s to help fill in profit for businesses that are selling it and enough profit to fund the social district,"" said Gussman. Patrons can purchase a designated cup in addition to buying an alcoholic beverage; they can also return it for some money back. ""You\'re not going to throw your $5-$8 cup away or leave it on the side of the road; you\'re going to take that home with you, or you\'re going to turn it back in at the end of the night and get a couple of bucks off your bar tab,"" said Gussman. ""The real sustainability is reusing."" Gussman emphasized sustainability because residents were concerned about littering throughout the city. ""All of us have received emails from residents throughout district one [Plaza Midwood] and other areas of the city where we have individuals that are sitting in people\'s front yards, that are messing up people\'s front yards, that have left their beer cans, trash, and other things throughout,"" said Council Member Lawana Mayfield during the council meeting approving Plaza Midwood\'s social district. Gussman mentioned cleanup programs and other initiatives associated with the social district to address residents and Mayfield\'s concerns. ""I think the cleanup program that we\'re looking at expanding should make that better, as well as if you are legally utilizing the social district, there are no beer cans — we didn\'t put any more beer cans in the community,"" said Gussman. ""The key part is those cleanups; it\'s making sure that a clean space tends to get less dirty than a dirty place."" Aside from the cleanup program, PMMA hopes to encourage more foot traffic around the Plaza Midwood area. ""This is so much more about being able to leave the restaurant,"" said Gussman. ""It really is about improving our pedestrian space, making people more comfortable and able to move around on foot instead of using a car."" To increase foot traffic, PMMA and the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) found ways to address mobility concerns around the Plaza Midwood area. ""We\'ve had a whole slate of mobility concerns and projects that we\'re pursuing to hopefully make Central Avenue a safer place to be,"" said Gussman. ""We have on-street parking on Central Avenue. Many of us think expanding that will (1) slow down Central Avenue only on off-hours and (2) give us more parking because we are a landlocked area."" In addition to traffic concerns, Gussman mentions potential public transportation to the Plaza Midwood area. ""We are currently working with a group to see if we can bring to Plaza Midwood E-vehicle shuttle to locations around the neighborhood, including the [Lynx] Blue Line station on Parkwood,"" said Gussman. ""Let\'s say you live in the University area and want to come to Plaza Midwood. Right now, there are very few ways to do that that won\'t take you an hour and a half,"" said Gussman. ""You\'ve got a train and a bus [and] if you were able to take last mile transit solutions from electric so it\'s more sustainable, from here, Plaza Midwood, to the Blue Line station, all of a sudden you\'ve got a much simpler connection that you\'re making."" Besides traffic and sustainability, PMMA anticipates changes in business prospects and the imbibing culture. ""We see the social district, in many ways, just complimenting many of the things that we are trying to encourage and build and make happen here,"" said Gussman. ""Some of this is trying to change the cultural understanding of how our community hangs out, drinks, however you want to put it, socialize."" To indicate the social district boundaries, PMMA will post signage; moreover, participating businesses will have signs posted to indicate their affiliation with the social district. ""There\'s going to be signage around the entire perimeter, every place a pedestrian can exit the social district,"" said Gussman. ""Everyone\'s going to get a sign on their door or the front of their business."" Gussman also mentioned QR codes on signage with information about the social district and how the designated cups work. ""You can\'t put your beer in the cup; you\'ve got to purchase that beer from one of our members,"" said Gussman. ""We\'re also going to have ambassadors on the street on those busy nights that we expect (Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays) to help tell people how they can get a cup, where they can get a cup, what they can do with the cup, where they can go with the cup, what they can\'t do with the cup.""

Brent Tomberlin The English writer and commentator Alistair Cooke described the Sunday morning of Dec. 7, 1941, as, “A cold, brilliant jewel of a day.” He was living in the nation’s capital and visited a friend’s house in the early afternoon to listen to the New York Philharmonic Orchestra on the radio. Cooke remembered the orchestral performance being interrupted by a news bulletin announcing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Japanese planes from six carriers, flying out of an early morning weather front near the Hawaiian island of Oahu, attacked the U.S. Pacific Fleet in stunning fashion. In two hours of attacks, they sunk four battleships, destroyed nearly 200 planes and killed more than 2,000 soldiers and civilians. Like Cooke, people remembered where they were and what they were doing for years after hearing of the attack. When I asked my grandmother to describe the moment she heard about Pearl Harbor, all she could do was moan — even after 50 years had passed. President Franklin Roosevelt was informed of the attack at 1:47 p.m. in the afternoon, about half an hour after Japanese planes began bombing their targets in Oahu. In her newspaper column the next day, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt wrote, “Finally, the blow had fallen.” At the time, most Americans were enjoying the traditional Sunday dinner hour on the East Coast and did not have their radios on. However, reports spread quickly and people soon gathered around radios to hear the devastating news. Phone lines jammed and switchboard operators were overwhelmed into the late afternoon. By 3 p.m., the president began receiving better reports on the carnage. He decided to give an address to a joint session of Congress and the nation the following day. Suffering from a terrible sinus infection and lacking his own speechwriters who were out of town, he worked calmly with his aides and staff to manage the many reports which arrived and began dictating his speech to his secretary, Grace Tully. She described him as, “Having a calmness in his rage.” Eleanor Roosevelt said FDR had clearly made up his mind to make his remarks as brief as possible and focus on the Japanese attack. The text of the speech came in under 500 words and he made some changes. His favorite aide and confidant, Harry Hopkins, also made an important alteration to the ending of the speech. The following Monday morning, FDR was dressed by his steward. His polio legs and feet were secured with steel braces weighing 10 pounds each. Then, under some of the biggest security known in America at the time, he was transported to the Capitol in a bulletproof car. At 12:15 p.m. Dec. 8, 1941, Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn gaveled a joint session of Congress to order. Fourteen minutes later, he introduced the president to the body. Yet, the people listening on the radio could not watch the symbolic and heroic journey the embattled leader made to the podium. Holding onto the arm of his son, James, Roosevelt manipulated his hips while James slowly helped push him down the aisle toward the rostrum. The president’s main goal was not to fall in front of this huge audience. A reporter commented he seemed to be in deep thought. Pressing on his son with extreme calm and concentration, and sweating profusely from absolute effort, President Roosevelt willed himself with the steel on his legs to the front of the room and up the wooden ramp which led to the podium. The president firmly grasped the podium as members of Congress broke out in applause. The approach through the audience and to the podium had been extremely difficult for FDR, but showed the country his amazing resolve as national leader. He completed it calmly and courageously. Roosevelt’s address lasted six and a half minutes and attracted the largest-ever radio audience at the time.

to say that the future of public schools in North Carolina depends largely on the Latino community. For years, many school systems have experienced a decline in student numbers, but thanks to the growth of Latinos, the student count remains stable. Despite this, our students and their families face numerous challenges. What does the 2023-2024 school year have in store for us? ¿Qué newsletter quieres recibir? Noticias Salud Entretenimiento Charlotte In the last 15 years, fewer families in North Carolina have been having children, and those who do are increasingly opting for alternatives to the public education system. Year after year, the number of students in private schools, charter schools, and home schooling is growing, especially post-pandemic. While the number of white and African American students in public schools has declined in recent years, there is one group that is consistently growing: Latinos. In Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS), which is home to the largest number of Latino students in the state, we see that since 2020, there have been more Latino students than White students in these schools. At the start of the 2022-2023 school year, CMS enrolled 41,640 students who identified as Latino, nearly one-third (29.5%) of all students. This is significant growth compared to the 2010-2011 school year, when 16% (22,221) of CMS students were Latino. With this clear trend, one might assume that CMS is investing economic, human, and educational resources in this group, since the success of Latino students is directly linked to the future of the school system. However, that is not the reality. In 2021, after a year of remote learning, 85% of Latino students in CMS did not achieve the reading score considered an indicator of their future success, and 87% scored below expectations in math. In 2022, the group with the lowest graduation rate was English language learners (65%), followed by Latinos (73.8%). What is the reason for this? A child’s academic success depends on both the school and how involved the student’s family is in their learning process. The issue is that many Latino families face significant obstacles, from inflexible work schedules and lack of knowledge about the system, to difficulties communicating with their children’s school, especially if they do not speak English. There is a clear shortage of teachers in schools, and this is compounded by a significant need for Spanish-speaking staff and a lack of representation. Although Latinos account for almost a third of CMS students, only 2% of teachers are Latino. One reason is the lack of incentives for bilingual staff. While county employees and workers such as firefighters and police officers receive a bonus for knowing a language other than English, there are no such incentives at CMS. How can we expect to retain school staff who could bridge the gap with Latino families? The landscape becomes more complex with a pending bill that expands a scholarship program to favor private schools at the expense of public ones. Despite all this, we want to believe that there is hope. In the new school year, CMS will inaugurate its first school with a Spanish name: Esperanza Global Academy. Hopefully, this is a sign that the school system is looking to serve a community that is vital to its survival. Periodista, editor, asesor, y presentador.

At the Greensboro City Council work session on Thursday, Oct. 26, Caesar-Crawford introduced the team from the city’s paid lobbying firm McuireWoods LLC to give a report on the success or lack of it the City of Greensboro had in the 2023 session of the North Carolina General Assembly. Ceasar-Crawford said, “Today, we have our state lobbying team with us, MGuireWoods, and we are going to have them give you an overview of how we are doing, sort of three-quarters of the way into our long session.” Ceasar-Crawford made this statement about being “three-quarters of the way into our long session” on Thursday, Oct. 26. The North Carolina legislature adjourned the long session on Wednesday, Oct. 25. It is true that the legislature is technically still in session, but as anyone who follows state government knows – and as the representative of McGuireWoods, Bo Heath, had to explain to some city councilmembers – the legislative session ended on Wednesday, Oct. 25. The legislature is still technically in session because it passed bills, including the redistricting bills on Wednesday, Oct. 25. If bills that have been passed are vetoed by Gov. Roy Cooper, then the legislature would be called back to Raleigh to override the veto. So far Cooper has vetoed 19 bills and the legislature has overridden all 19 vetoes. The governor can’t veto the redistricting bill, but it will be challenged in court, and should a court rule against the legislature, it might have to come back into session to redraw one or more of the redistricting maps. But as far as passing new legislation, the leaders of the state House and state Senate have said they are done for the 2023 session and held a press conference on Wednesday, Oct. 25 to talk about what had been accomplished in the “fairly historic session.” However, someone who doesn’t understand how the legislature operates could easily be confused by the fact that technically the legislature will be called to order and then recessed without taking up any business for the next several months. So the long session adjourned on Wednesday, Oct. 25 and on Thursday, Oct. 26 Caesar-Crawford, who is being paid by the taxpayers of Greensboro to follow and lobby for legislation for the City of Greensboro, said the session was only “three-quarters” of the way done. It is worth noting that this did not appear to be a case of Caesar-Crawford misspeaking. She had plenty of time to go back and correct her remarks, but she did not. Caesar-Crawford’s statement put the representative of McGuire Woods in a difficult position because his entire presentation was a review of the actions taken by the NC General Assembly in the 2023 session. How do you explain that bills that had not passed in this session had no chance of passing when the city employee charged with overseeing Greensboro’s relationship with the legislature has just said that the legislature is only “three-quarters” of the way through the session? Heath did a good job of explaining that the session was over without correcting Caesar-Crawford directly. Share: Trying to be generous here, perhaps she was thinking in terms of the entire biennium’s expected number of months…approximately 12. With 9 months under their belt, they’re 3/4 of the way done. But unfortunately by specifying “long session” that doesn’t pass muster. EDI at its finest moment. Your tax dollars at work. Keep the buffoons in power!! GSO continues to wallow as a Sh&# Hole. You can’t hide stupid! “Intergovernmental Relations Manager LaToya Caesar-Crawford”. . . .has anyone looked into her hiring (was it published as an open position, etc?), her former and current background in intergovernmental issues, local politics, etc? She is definitely not fit to do the job, so why is she still there when the City is now contracted with a consulting firm to do the job she was hired to do? Would be nice to know her background and connections to the city management, the council, etc. Once again, DEI exposed as cronyism. Intergovernmental Relations Manager LaToya Caesar-Crawford. Her Linked in account: https://www.linkedin.com/in/latoyacaesar Looks like her background has been in education and DEI programs, so how and why was she deemed qualified to be in the position she holds? I’ll give you three guesses, and the first two don’t count. Hmmm…look at that… Looks like the long session is not over…. House and Senate re-convene on November 29. If you actually understand procedurally the complexities and nuances of the legislative session, you would understand her statement. This article actually validated her statement after calling her incompetent. Legislators are free to come back and vote on legislation at their discretion, even after adjourning. This article and its comments all reek of racism, sexism, and complete inability to do your own research on both the person in the position and the governmental process. Didn’t know that a reporter was actually in a position to evaluate a professional’s “competence”. https://www.ncleg.gov/legislativecalendar/ Either way Greensboro continues to get stomped on by the legislature in Raleigh. As long as we have this city council that will continue. News Alert!!!! She got a “way above average” pay raise last year. Who says it doesn’t pay to do nothing?

It started on Oct. 23 and has grown to more than 5,447 acres, affecting Cherokee, Macon, and Clay counties. Despite an early November cold front that brought cooler temperatures and light rain, the fire, sparked by lightning, according to the U.S. Forest Service, remains only 80% contained as of Nov. 16. The challenging terrain, low humidity, and ongoing drought have exacerbated the situation. Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on Nov. 8, enabling additional protective measures. A state of emergency, according to state law, can be declared during a situation or imminent threat of widespread or severe damage, injury, or loss of life or property resulting from a natural or man-made cause. The declaration enables government officials to take extra measures to protect the public. The response includes 232 local, state, and federal firefighting teams attempting to contain the fire, which is four miles south of Andrews in the southwest corner of the state. In addition to federal and state agencies, personnel from county emergency management teams, law enforcement, and volunteer fire departments are also typically part of the team that responds to wildfires. The Collett Ridge fire is located in a steep and remote area of the Nantahala National Forest. To minimize the risk to firefighters, the strategy utilized existing and man-made fire containment lines, such as streams and roads. The fire response was initially coordinated by the U.S. Forest Service and the North Carolina Forest Service, but as the fire expanded, the Forest Service delegated authority to an incident command team – an interagency group of experts that coordinate logistics, operations, and information. Firefighter and public safety are the U.S. Forest Service’s top priorities in wildfire response. Amid an ongoing severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, Western North Carolina is experiencing a surge in wildfires and elevated wildfire risk that endanger both communities and public lands. The risk of additional wildfires remains, requiring the collective efforts of residents, land managers, and emergency personnel to protect both public lands and private property. The North Carolina Forest Service, which is responsible for protecting state- and privately-owned forest land from wildfires, has banned open burning in 30 WNC counties. “If we have an extended period of drought in the fall, we can have massive fires that are really hard to stop,” said U.S. Forest Service fire research ecologist Steve Norman. “As you’re trying to put it out, it’s constantly being replenished by litter falling from the trees.” In Henderson County, the 95% contained 430 acre Poplar Drive fire destroyed two homes, two outbuildings, and three cabins. In the Nov. 14 Poplar Drive fire briefing, Brian Rogers of the N.C. Forest Service said fire crews are identifying repairs to infrastructure, such as roads and culverts. “Wildfires suppression uses heavy equipment,” he said. “Sometimes there is wear and tear to logging roads, the land, and properties. We’re looking at what we need to do to get those repaired.” The Collett Ridge fire has not yet resulted in any lost structures. The fully contained 300-acre East Fork fire in Jackson County is not expected to spread. On Nov. 16, a 150-acre fire in Haywood County, caused by a vehicle accident on Interstate-40, was reported by the U.S. Forest Service. The agency stated that a 20-person hand crew, supported by aircraft water and fire-retardant drops, was working to slow its advance. MountainTrue public lands biologist Josh Kelly and U.S. Forest Service fire research ecologist Steve Norman emphasize the long-term ecological benefits of wildfires, such as improved wildlife habitat and reduced future wildfire risk. However, they caution against the challenges in managing wildfires compared to controlled burns. “The forests will be better off in the long run,” Kelly said. “The downside is that wildfires, as opposed to controlled burns, are much more difficult to manage.” Kelly also highlights the increased risk posed by developments in vulnerable areas. The widespread fires of 2016, including the Chimney Tops 2 wildfire in Eastern Tennessee, serve as a stark reminder of the potential severity of such events. There are also high costs associated with wildfire response, Norman said, depending on the range of resources used, its proximity to structures, and population density. “We can be more intentional about where we build houses. Building on forested slopes and ridges increases their risk,” Kelly said. “Developments that are allowed to be built with inadequate access are also a huge risk. When policymakers approve developments, they should account for the potential wildfire.” According to the National Interagency Fire Center an estimated $12 million has been spent on the Collett Ridge fire. “It takes a lot of money to keep everybody safe,” Norman said. Todd and Lindy Smith, who own and rent three log cabins located within two miles of the wildfire’s origin on Collett Creek, expressed their satisfaction with the U.S. Forest Service’s efforts to keep residents informed and safe. “We were very concerned when the fire started,” said Todd Smith, who has stayed in close contact with the U.S. Forest Service throughout the duration of the fire. The Smiths also received operation updates from the agency’s Facebook Page that included daily briefings with videos addressing the progress of the fire and the response. “I would say we were pleasantly surprised with the U.S. Forest Service,” he said. “They were really focused on keeping residents safe.” The response team is working with local fire departments on structure protection plans for future wildfires. While the fire is gradually being contained, ongoing monitoring and mop-up operations continue, with some resources expected to be withdrawn. The situation remains precarious without significant rainfall, as hot spots may persist, requiring continued vigilance from firefighters. In the Nov. 15 Collett Ridge fire briefing, Wes McKinney of the response team said they are working with local fire departments to develop structure protection plans for future wildfires. While even a small amount of rain can aid firefighters, without significant precipitation, hot spots may continue to smoke, requiring firefighters to continue monitoring the landscapes. “We are starting to move resources out. We’ll probably have most resources out by Friday [11/17],” he said. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, which is released weekly on Thursday, several counties in WNC, including Cherokee County, are experiencing extreme drought conditions. Lack of rainfall, fuel from falling leaves, and unseasonably warm temperatures are a volatile combination, said Norman of the U.S. Forest Service. “Fires are common in the Southern Appalachians in the fall and spring and are always a concern,” he said. But the widespread fires of 2016 throughout the Southern Appalachians “shocked the fire research community”. Over 50,000 acres burned in the fall of 2016 during an extreme drought. Among them was the Chimney Tops 2 wildfire that burned 18,000 acres in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, spreading to Gatlinburg, Tennessee, killing 14 and damaging 1,400 structures. “[The year] 2016 was extraordinary. It demonstrated just how massive fall fires can be,” Norman said. “So anytime we have a big event like the Collette Ridge fire, we take notice.” _____ Have a question about this story?

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Published 1:49 pm Tuesday, August 15, 2023 By Mike Barnhardt By Mike Walden NCSU When growing up in the 1950s, I was a fan of the Superman TV show. The program opened with the announcer looking up at the sky and saying, “It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s Superman!” I’ve used a modified version of today’s column to add some humor to the serious question of what kind of an economy we have now. Many say the economy is not changing according to the script we’ve usually seen in the past. As a result, there’s confusion and concern about where the economy is headed. There’ve been numerous explanations given, with some suggesting good times ahead and others indicating bad times, but all pointing to an unusual economy. We’re hearing phrases and terms like a soft landing economy, a full employment recession, a rich recession, a rolling recession and an economy ultimately headed for a big crash. I’ll attempt to explain what all these phrases and terms mean. Then, as is always the case, I’ll let you decide which picture of the economy makes the most sense. The interpretations of the economy are divided into the good and the bad. On the good side are a soft landing economy and a full-employment economy, which I’ll turn to first. A soft landing for the economy is exactly what the Federal Reserve is trying to accomplish with its interest rate hikes. By slowly increasing interest rates over the past two years, the Fed wants to moderate the pace of economic growth and bring buying more in line with the supply of goods and services. The result would be to take the pressure off prices and lower the rate of price increases. Through this gradual approach, the Fed hopes the economy will still grow, although more slowly, thereby avoiding a crash into a recession. A recession means the economy contracts, that is, gets smaller. Right now, with the economy continuing to expand and with the year-over-year inflation rate reduced from 9% to 3%, many think the Fed could guide the economy into landing safely on the runway of lower inflation. The soft landing means the inflation rate returns to a normal level without the pain of job losses and economic retreat. A soft landing is obviously the best result for the country, but it has been difficult to achieve in the past. A full employment recession is a term several economists have used to describe today’s unusual economy. The idea is the economy will eventually slip into a recession, but it won’t impact the job market. This is different because the accepted definition of a recession requires economic contraction to be widespread, including job losses. A full employment recession means the non-labor part of the economy — such as technology, machinery, finance and construction — will suffer. But the labor part of the economy won’t. Unlike a normal recession, in a full employment recession, the unemployment rate remains low and aggregate job losses don’t happen. Sure, as always occurs, some firms will reduce jobs, but those cuts will be made up by job gains in other sectors. Why would the job market be spared in a full employment recession? It’s a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and anticipated shortages in workers. Many firms had trouble hiring workers during and after the pandemic. Memories of those difficulties could motivate businesses to keep workers, even if the firms experience reduced sales for a while. Plus, looking ahead, experts see the labor force only expanding between 0.5 and 1% annually, less than half the rate of 50 years ago. Indeed, except for a brief rebound in the early 2000s, labor force growth has been steadily dropping for five decades. The weak labor force outlook is another reason why companies may want to hold on to their workers, even in relatively challenging times. Now onto the bad interpretations of today’s economy. Some argue the economy is already in a recession, but the difference is it’s mainly been confined to the rich, hence the name rich recession. The tech sector, which pays salaries double that of other jobs, has cut more than 650,000 jobs in 2022 and the first half of 2023. This represents a loss of $65 billion in purchasing power and has hurt businesses catering to higher-income consumers. In contrast, workers in lower-paying jobs have received the highest rate of pay increases this decade. This is because many of those workers have become more valuable to businesses due to the labor shortage affecting several economic sectors. Another interpretation of the current economic situation is another new term: a rolling recession. Here, a recession rolls through the economy, not impacting all sectors at the same time, but instead affecting each at different times. Initially, sectors supplying services were hit, due to the continuing reluctance of people to personally interact as a result of COVID-19. Companies making products did well as consumers purchased items like furniture, clothing and vehicles they couldn’t get during the pandemic. Hence, a recession hit service companies first but spared product companies. Eventually, this dichotomy flipped, as higher interest rates made many products too expensive, and fear about the face-to-face contact implied when buying services subsided. So now the recession has rolled past service firms and is hitting product firms. Last is the viewpoint that the economy may look reasonably good today, but a big crash is eventually coming. Supporters of this idea say rising interest rates combined with high and rising debt will eventually cause an economic implosion. Are you confused about today’s economy? Don’t worry, you have company; economists are also befuddled. I hope I’ve been able to give you a scorecard for the different interpretations to help you decide how to navigate through today’s uncertainty.

cloudy skies in the morning will give way to cloudy skies during the afternoon. High around 85F. Winds SSW at 5 to 10 mph.. Overcast. Low 66F. Winds SSW at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 2:06 am Wyse Fork Junction in Kinston is under review as the N.C. Department of Transportation looks to the future of U.S. 70 Kinston Bypass, a project with an estimated cost of $716.2 million. Essentially, the proposed Kinston Bypass would be a four-lane, median divided freeway that extends approximately 21 miles from U.S. 70 near La Grange to U.S. 70 near Dover. The bypass would upgrade U.S. 70 in Lenoir, Jones and Craven Counties by eliminating traditional intersections with stop signs or traffic signals. In their place, interchanges with bridges, ramps or loops would be built to improve safety and regional mobility. The bypass route would be located at Willie Measley/Jim Sutton roads, Albert Sugg/ Barwick Station roads and N.C. 148, according to the NCDOT project highlights. A new interchange east of N.C. 148 would provide access to a section of the selected bypass. This would parallel existing U.S. 70 to the south of the new location for approximately 6.5 miles. Interchanges along the new location portion of the selected route would be located at N.C. 11/ N.C. 55, U.S. 258 (South Queen Street) and N.C. 58 (Trent Highway). A new interchange east of Lenoir Community College would connect the bypass to existing U.S. 70. The bypass would then follow existing U.S. 70 from this interchange east of Dover and would upgrade U.S. 70 to a fully accessible highway with interchanges at Wyse Fork/ Caswell Station roads and Old U.S. 70 in Dover. The project lists a speed limit for the bypass of 70 mph and aims to help reduce traffic congestion and delays that currently exist along U.S. 70 across multiple counties. According to Highway Division Two Project Development and Engineer Heather Lane, the Kinston Bypass project has been around for quite some time, to address a specific purpose and need. “We’re trying to address the traffic congestion, capacity deficiencies and delays along Hwy 70,” Lane said. “We had several different alternatives that we presented to the public, we presented to our various stakeholders such as environmental agencies to our counties and so forth.” Lane explained through this process, the bypass project was selected. The shallow bypass option was chosen for the Kinston Bypass project based on having the most public support, shortest project length, least amount of projected wetland impacts, highest projected net economic benefit, while also preserving the rural character of southern Lenoir County. In order for the project to move forward, the intersection at Wyse Fork/ Caswell Station must be upgraded to interstate standards. NCDOT is currently weighing three different options to achieve this. Option one: Build a full-access interchange with a bridge, ramps and loop, requiring 55 acres of new right of way. Option two: Build a compressed interchange, which would allow drivers to exit from and onto the highway from the two side roads and require 30.5 acres of new right of way. Option three: Build an overpass within any highway access to the two side roads. This option requires 12.3 acres and would eliminate direct access to U.S. 70. All three options would impact the Wyse Fork Battlefield and also require the construction of new service roads, according to NCDOT. In August, the Kinston Free Press published an article detailing the battle that concerned residents and local historians started against the NCDOT project. Dennis Harper is the man leading efforts to save the battlefield. Harper is Chairman of Save Wyse Fork Battlefield Commission and is representing the Historical Preservation Group to the US Army Corps of Engineers during the interchange project, according to The Kinston Free Press. Harper said that the future Interstate 42 is a threat to the Wyse Forks Battlefield because a 55-acre interchange will destroy a major piece of the core battlefield area, according to The Kinston Free Press. NCDOT is currently in the process of reviewing and developing concepts at this interchange location but no decision has been made yet, according to Lane. “Those consulting parties provided us a lot of feedback recently, so right now we’re taking that most recent feedback and we’re seeing what we can come up with through our designs to see if we can find something that meets everyone’s need or is a better option for that location,” Lane said. Currently, there are no construction funds for the project. Lane said NCDOT is only funded for preliminary engineering or designs. Lane said NCDOT is working on the challenge of securing funds for the project, like through the State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP). NCDOT updates the STIP approximately every two years, which identifies the construction funding and schedule for state transportation improvement projects. over a ten-year period, as previously reported by The Sun Journal. According to the NCDOT project webpage, this project will be reprioritized in the next STIP. The strategic prioritization process has begun in North Carolina to determine which projects will make it into the 2026-2034 STIP, as previously reported by The Sun Journal. Lane said NCDOT hopes to have more information in the near future, around the beginning of 2024. Reporter Caramia Valentin can be reached at cvalentin@newbernsj.com.

enlightenment of Witchcraft in Asheville UNC Asheville students, faculty and staff protest UNC System policy that would remove DEI initiatives Three years after a bomb threat at the University of North Carolina at Asheville over the Black Lives Matter mural that students worked to paint on University Heights, another controversy surrounds the mural. Construction that began earlier this year brought not just the disruption of traffic flow, and student beaten paths, but also the removal of the iconic mural. “I found out about it last year through SGA, under the Braswell/Okoro administration,” said Liv Barefoot, a 20-year-old political science major from Raleigh. Since last year, the Office of Multicultural Affairs is working with the interim chancellor in order to preserve the mural in some way, said SGA officials. “There are talks of a more permanent structure or sculpture, between the Office of Multicultural Affairs,” Barefoot said. During the summer, many pieces of the mural were saved and stored in the SGA office for the very intention of creating something new out of something broken, SGA officials say. “I definitely think the mural should be repainted,” said Natshia Best, a 20-year-old political science major. The creation of the mural was a joint effort of students who spent over eight hours working on what some consider to be a part of UNCA history. “I was a part of the history of the mural. While I didn’t design the letters, my peers, and I was out there; volunteering to paint, I brought a speaker out there to make it more of a ‘block party’ and just to have a good time,” Best said. A piece that could be seen from high overhead, the mural represented a connection to the campus for black students that was special to them. “It’s special because it gives us black students’ reassurance that the school actually has our back when it’s predominantly white here. With the amount of black students on campus, that reassurance is very important,” Best said. The construction of the mural caused such a controversy that a bomb threat was called in and the school had to go into lockdown. The university responded quickly. Students and faculty remained unharmed. However, through talks between the Office of Multicultural Affairs, SGA, and the interim chancellor, the decision to remove the mural was made in order to make way for the construction currently underway. Some students say the mural may have been removed on purpose as a sort of safety measure to prevent future threats against the campus. “Honestly, with everything going on with anti-DEI law, I feel that this was on purpose. That’s all I have to say about that,” Best said. The mural may have caused controversy, but it was also a piece of campus history. Some feel as though that history is being erased. According to Melanie Fox, associate vice chancellor for student affairs, there is hope for the mural as there are talks of maintaining the pride and history of the Black Lives Matter movement by building a permanent structure somewhere on campus. “The previous administration, Braswell-Okoro, has written legislation for it, all we have to do is sign it off as soon as SGA gets settled,” Best said. “If it’s permanent, it’s been talked about as being where the first Black students on campus lived.” “The campus is discussing some options with the larger group of campus constituents in conjunction with the Steam Studio, the idea of creating a memorial bench out of the remaining artwork has come to the forefront,” Fox said. The new structure is estimated to be on campus in the fall of 2024. “A large part of the course will be to engage with the campus community on the plans and creation of the artwork in order to honor and memorialize the original piece most effectively. Because of this, there will be opportunities for students, faculty and staff to provide ideas and feedback to the artists throughout the creation process,” Fox said. While the mural was a landmark, and though it’s now out of sight, the chancellor assures students this project will not be pushed aside and forgotten. “This will not be something that is out of sight and out of mind as the artwork is created. Instead, we believe that this is a community piece that will be created out of the collaborative efforts and feedback from any and all members of the university.

Let's see what the statistics say. ¿Qué newsletter quieres recibir? Noticias Salud Entretenimiento Charlotte According to a study by the Pew Research Center, the third generation of Latinos living in the United States tends to make English their primary language for communication, leaving Spanish aside. Among the reasons for this shift are the bombardment of English information that young people receive through the media. Pew suggests that the newer generations grow up in a world where they believe Spanish is not necessary, but is this true? Beyond this perception, the reality is that the Castilian language, far from disappearing, seems to be strengthening in the United States. Today, businesses show much more interest than in previous decades in having bilingual staff, and this is due to demographic changes that cannot be ignored.

The number of potential Spanish speakers in the world (including native speakers, those with limited proficiency, and students) surpasses 595 million, making it the second most widely spoken language for international communication after English.

The plant was built in 1982 as a printing site for The Wall Street Journal and was acquired in 2013 by McClatchy, where it printed the Charlotte Observer and several other McClatchy-owned newspapers as well as The Wall Street Journal. North State Media, the parent company of North State Journal, acquired the building and land at 9140 Research Dr. in late 2022. The facility will maintain its status as a hub for regional and national newspapers. Tuesday’s announcement is the latest in the continued expansion of the North State footprint. In May, North State Media acquired the Chatham News & Record, one of the oldest newspapers in North Carolina. North State Journal prints its flagship statewide edition weekly with readership in all 100 counties as well as six local editions in Chatham, Forsyth, Hoke, Moore, Randolph and Stanly counties. William King, the new chief operating officer of Charlotte Publishing Company, has 34 years of experience in the newspaper industry and will lead the plant’s transition to new ownership. King has extensive experience at the Charlotte facility having previously served as a regional vice president for The McClatchy Company. “This move ensures the long-term future of printing at this facility,” said King. “I am looking forward to joining the North State Journal team and reuniting with some of my former colleagues at the Charlotte plant.” Trip Hoffend, the new senior vice president, has 24 years of manufacturing experience. Hoffend, a graduate of the Wake Forest University School of Business where he earned an MBA, has multi-industry experience with mergers, acquisitions and business transitions. “We are looking forward to working with the great people at the Charlotte facility and engaging newspapers of all sizes in our region to produce print products of the highest quality,” said Hoffend. “We are committed to helping the newspaper industry thrive in the Carolinas.” Robbins will serve as president of the Charlotte Publishing Company and continue to serve as publisher of North State Journal. He holds a degree in chemical engineering from NC State and previously worked as a manufacturing engineer in the textiles industry. He also holds a law degree and MBA from Wake Forest University. “We look forward to working with McClatchy and the employees at the Charlotte facility on a transition plan over the next few months that will keep jobs in Mecklenburg County and maintain the Queen City’s position as a hub for important print publications on the East Coast,” said Robbins. “North State Journal has strong readership in the Charlotte metro area, and we hope our increased presence will improve our ability to cover important stories there.” Aerosmith postpones Raleigh show, others after frontman Steven Tyler suffers vocal cord damage Georgia Gov.

Cloudy in the evening with scattered thunderstorms developing after midnight. Low 64F. Winds light and variable. Chance of rain 40%. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 2:02 am WASHINGTON — The White House has been increasingly pressuring Congress to pass stalled legislation to support Ukraine’s war against Russia, saying that funding has run out. On Tuesday, however, President Joe Biden touted a new military aid package worth $200 million for Ukraine. Money is dwindling. But the announcement of more weapons being sent to Kyiv just underscores the complexity of the funding. So has the money run out? Or are there still a few billion dollars floating around? It’s complicated. STORE CREDIT ...In a Nov. 4 letter to Congress, White House budget director Shalanda Young said flatly: “We are out of money to support Ukraine in this fight. This isn’t a next year problem. The time to help a democratic Ukraine fight against Russian aggression is right now.” Since then, the U.S. has announced three more aid packages totaling $475 million. That may seem contradictory, but it’s due to the complex programs used to send aid to Ukraine. There are two pots of money for weapons and security assistance set up specifically for the war. One is the Presidential Drawdown Authority, or PDA, under which the U.S. provides weapons already in its stockpile. The other is the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which funds long-term weapons contracts. Money for USAI has all been spent. That pot is empty. And money for the PDA also appeared to be gone. But then the Pentagon determined that it had overstated the value of the weapons it had already sent Ukraine, overcharging the Ukraine weapons account by $6.2 billion. That effectively left Ukraine with a store credit that is slowly being whittled down. It now stands at around $4.4 billion. PDA packages continued to be announced every few weeks. But in recognition of the dwindling money, the latest packages have been smaller — about $200 million or less, compared with previous ones that often totaled $400 million to $500 million. ... BUT EMPTY SHELVESIn theory, the Pentagon would have enough equipment to offer these smaller packages for months. But there’s a caveat: While the credit exists, there may not be enough stock on the Pentagon shelves. So some weapons may be unavailable. Congressional funding to buy weapons to replace the ones the U.S. sends to Ukraine is now down to about $1 billion. That dwindling money means the military services are worried they won’t be able to buy all the weapons they need to ensure the U.S. military is ready to defend the American homeland. For example, the 155 mm rounds commonly used by Howitzers are one of the most requested artillery munitions by Kyiv. The demand has been so high that the Army has pressed the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania, where the shell casings for the rounds are made, to increase production in order to meet war demands and have enough on hand for American military needs. On Thursday, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters the U.S. could provide the full $4.4 billion in weapons, but with only a quarter of that amount available for replenishment, it’s a tough choice. “We have to start to make decisions about our own readiness,” he said. THE POLITICAL WRANGLING The U.S. has already sent Ukraine $111 billion in weapons, equipment, humanitarian assistance and other aid since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion more than 21 months ago. But the latest package is stalled. Support for Ukraine funding has been waning as some lawmakers see the war taking funding from domestic needs. But the broader problem is a political battle over the southern U.S. border. President Joe Biden is urging Congress to pass a $110 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other national security needs. It includes $61.4 billion for Ukraine, with about half to replenish Pentagon stocks. It also includes about $14 billion for Israel as it fights Hamas and $14 billion for U.S. border security. Other funds would go for security needs in the Asia-Pacific. Prospects for compromise remain in doubt, even as Zelenskyy warned in a speech at the National Defense University in Washington on Monday that, “If there’s anyone inspired by unresolved issues on Capitol Hill, it’s just Putin and his sick clique.” THE JOBS ARGUMENT Harkening back to the “all politics is local” idea, the Pentagon and the White House have rolled out maps and statistics to show members of Congress how their own districts and states are reaping benefits from the Ukraine funding. Charts detail $10 billion in industry contracts for weapons ranging from air defense systems and missiles to a wide array of drones, ammunition and other equipment. And they break out an additional nearly $16.8 billion in contracts to replenish Pentagon stocks. The maps show contracts benefitting industries and companies in more than 35 different states. And U.S. officials are hoping the local jobs argument will help build support for the funding. HOW BIG IS THE NEED? Winter has set in, so the fighting in Ukraine has leveled off a bit. And along stretches of the battlefront, fighting is somewhat stalemated. But Ukrainian forces have been taking ground back in some key locations, and Zelenskyy and other leaders have said they want to keep pushing forward. Ukraine does not want to give the Russians weeks or months this winter to reset and further solidify their fighting positions — as they did last winter. During his visit to Washington this week, Zelenskyy said his forces are making progress, and the White House pointed to newly declassified intelligence that shows Ukraine has inflicted heavy losses on Russia in recent fighting around the eastern city of Avdiivka — including 13,000 casualties and over 220 combat vehicles lost. The Ukrainian holdout in the country’s partly occupied east has been the center of some of the fiercest fighting in recent weeks. Putin on Thursday, however, said his troops are making gains. “Almost all along the line of contact our armed forces, let’s put it modestly, are improving their positions, almost all are in an active stage of action and there is an improvement in the position of our troops all along,” he said. ___ Associated Press writer Tara Copp contributed to this report.

The Pirates are coming off a big win against Florida Atlantic University (4-6, 3-3 AAC) 22-7 last weekend. ECU sophomore kicker Andrew Conrad nailed five field goals to give the Pirates their second win on the year. Going into this game against the Naval Academy, ECU has found success in scoring earlier in games. In their last three games, the Pirates have maintained a first quarter lead in each of them, the first time they’ve managed to do so this year. While ECU’s record is 1-2 in those games, they’ve kept it within one possession or less in all but one. Defensively, the Pirates should expect a heavy run attack by Navy. The triple option offense Navy runs is very formalized. Despite switching starting quarterbacks a few weeks back, Navy still rushes more than they pass statistically. “The triple option stuff is always a challenge to prepare for, but now you factor that in with everything else you\'re having to prepare for and it\'s a lot,” Head Coach Mike Houston said in his weekly press conference. “We faced teams like this in the past and when they can do all of it well, it\'s really challenging for your defensive players to play one thing one series and then be playing a different style the next snap."" The Pirates are solid against the run so far this year, allowing only 114.3 rush yards per game to opponents. That number ranks ECU No. 25 in rush defense. Navy record is 0-1 when facing a team ranked in the Top 25 for rush defense. On offense, ECU would like to see the continued progress of making possessions count. More often than not, the Pirates have walked away from most of their drives without points or pushing into opponents territory before punting the ball away. ""I think we\'ve just got to maximize our possessions,” Houston said. “We can\'t give any of them away. I think in this ball game, it\'s going to be special teams, field position and turnovers. Those are going to be the key factors. We can\'t give any of our possessions away, so we need to do a good job of ball security and decision making. We\'ve got to do a great job on third down.” ""I think we\'ve just got to maximize our possessions,” Houston said. “We can\'t give any of them away. I think in this ball game, it\'s going to be special teams, field position and turnovers. Those are going to be the key factors. We can\'t give any of our possessions away, so we need to do a good job of ball security and decision making. We\'ve got to do a great job on third down.” Despite being eliminated from bowl contention, ECU has a chance to derail Navy\'s season. The Midshipmen currently have five losses, and a win by the Pirates will drop them to one game away from losing bowl eligibility. To be eligible for a bowl game, Navy would have to win out after losing to ECU. Navy and ECU have played each other 10 times in the past, with ECU only winning two of those games. The Pirates have been outscored by Navy by a point differential of 43 points per matchup to ECU’s 26.7 points per matchup. “For the last month or so, we’ve been working on the Navy gameplan on Sundays both with our defense and our scout team players,” Houston said. “I thought we had a fast start. Today and tomorrow will be the big test because that’s the stuff in pads. You’re not playing tag against this team. It’s going to be a very physical football game, so we need to be prepared to play at a high level there, not only executing defensively but playing with that physicality.” The last time these two teams played, Navy got the win over ECU 23-20 on Sept. 24 2022. The game went into double overtime and the Pirates lost a thriller off of a missed last minute field goal in overtime. ECU is 2-8 against the Naval academy, but both wins for the Pirates came in Annapolis. Statistically, this looks to be a defensive game from both teams despite past matchups. ECU and the Naval Academy average under 20 points per game on the season. Defensively, they allow less than 25 points per game. Following this game against Navy, ECU will play their season finale at home against the University of Tulsa (3-7, 1-5 AAC) next Saturday at 2 p.m. in Greenville, North Carolina.

DKMS US maya@dkms.org (929) 618-1768 DKMS, the world’s largest network of stem cell donor centers, to host media event to raise awareness of how the lack of diversity in the global stem cell donor pool has led to ethnic disparities for patients searching for a donor. WHAT: Stem cell transplants can be the best or only treatment for patients fighting blood cancers like leukemia as well as approximately 70 other conditions. For patients in need of a transplant, around 70% will have to find a donor outside of their family. Unfortunately, ethnic disparities exist in finding a matching donor. White patients have a 79% chance of finding a match, that number drops to 48% for Hispanic/Latino patients, and drops even further to 29% for African American patients. DKMS is hosting a media event where you’ll have the chance to hear stories from community members who have been directly impacted by stem cell transplantation and learn why it is so important for everyone, especially people from diverse ethnic backgrounds, to get registered as potential donors. There will be an opportunity for one-on-one interviews with the speakers after the formal remarks. WHO: Speakers Include: After losing her childhood best friend to Sickle Cell Anemia, Jasmine registered as a potential donor at a DKMS donor drive at Wingate University. A few years later, she got the call that she was a match for a young girl also battling Sickle Cell and was asked if she would be willing to donate her blood stem cells. Without hesitation, Jasmine said yes and went on to save that young girl’s life. Jasmine will speak on what being a donor means to her and how her donation experience has impacted her life. As a transplant physician, Dr. Shah works with patients in need of stem cell transplants every day. The reasons for their transplants vary, but the commonality between them is that they all must find a matching donor. Unfortunately, too often for the patients he treats, a match will not be found. This reality is even more common for patients of diverse ethnic backgrounds. Dr. Shah will speak on why it is so important for everyone to register as a potential donor. In 2018, Kristi was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia, a form of blood cancer. After chemotherapy, her doctors told her that she would need a stem cell transplant. Having worked in the hospitality industry for two decades, Kristi had an amazing support system who provided her and her family with nourishing meals while she went through treatment. Kristi was fortunate enough to find a donor through DKMS and is now doing well. She will speak about how her experience inspired her to create her own non-profit, Feast for Good, to give back to the community by providing other cancer patients in the Charlotte area with locally sourced, healthy meals. Dr. Neujahr will provide some background on what DKMS is and speak on our organization’s efforts to increase diversity in the global donor pool through international expansion. She will also share how easy it is to get registered and provide ways that members of the community can make an impact.

But with no one answering the phone, and the gatekeepers at the Walmart entrance simply repeating “sorry, we’re closed,” they were simply out of luck, like Lilly Carnes, who’d come on an errand for her mother’s diabetes meds. “I hope she has a couple of pills left to get through until tomorrow,” Carnes said. Meanwhile, Rose Beck came all the way from Bryson City to get a shower caddy, desk lamp and mattress for her twins’ dorm rooms, heading off for their first year of college at App State and Chapel Hill. The trip wasn’t a total waste since they hit Chick-Fil-A while in town, a worthy pilgrimage in and of itself since Waynesville has the only Chick-Fil-A west of Asheville. “I guess we’ll turn around and go back home,” Beck said, the smell of waffle fries wafting from the car. College kids soon shipping out for school were out in force Wednesday evening, including Josie and Ralyn Ballance — both students at Western Carolina University. Josie hoped to score a futon to revamp her room decor from last year, and Ralyn needed a fan. “It’s super hot in the dorms,” she said. “And I move it at 8 a.m. Friday morning.” Poor 13-year-old Eathan Loftin had come all the way from Franklin to get a Transformer toy, after seeing the new Transformer movie in theaters. And poor grandmother Judy Loftin, who had made the 90-minute round trip for naught. “Oh well, it happens,” she said. The Waynesville Walmart is something of a regional hub — a magnet for shoppers from the more rural counties to the west. Darlene Ledford comes twice a month from Cherokee to stock up on the necessities. Wednesday night’s list called for dog food, cat food, pinto beans and mulch. Two women with a catering business made the trip over from Candler, because it’s easier to get to than fighting the traffic in Asheville, she says. “Now we don’t have product and we have customers we have to cook for tomorrow,” said Gail Jones. Hitting another grocery store wasn’t an option. “You’ve got to have specific ingredients to make our dishes,” said Leigh Holland. Meanwhile, an extended family of 13 on vacation from Indiana had come to stock their AirBnB. “We’re celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary and brought all the kids and grandkids,” said Susan Speicher. But the family had to continue their scavenger hunt for groceries elsewhere. Despite the barren parking lot, many shoppers parked and walked up to the entrance, oblivious until the store workers posted out front told them it was closed. But Melissa Leabhart didn’t bother getting out of the truck and simply pulled away again. She knew something was amiss when she pulled into the parking lot. “I thought ‘I’ve never seen the parking lot that bare,’” she said. As for that vegan frozen carrot cake? Click here!

(The Center Square) — Freedom for North Carolinians as compared to other states has fallen, according to a new report. North Carolina ranked 24th in the country in the recently released Freedom in the 50 States from the Cato Institute. Fifteen years ago, it was No. 13. And since the turn of the century, it has never ranked so far from the top. Cato’s fiscal policy recommendations in the report say, “Cut spending on hospitals, possibly through privatization, which is far above the national average. Build up the rainy-day fund and trim individual income taxes further.” Regulatory recommendations are, “Eliminate all rate regulations on property and casualty insurance and fully free direct-to-consumer auto sales at the same time.” And recommendations for personal freedoms are, “Pass constitutional carry to expand gun rights.” The state’s recently passed budget grows the rainy day fund balance by $125 million to just under $5 billion by the end of 2023-24. The report says the state was 13th on personal freedom as recently as 2015 but checks in this year at No. 33. It cites a “decline in fiscal policy.” North Carolina has grown to be the ninth-largest state. The report says, “Despite large in-migration, North Carolina has eschewed excessive controls on the housing supply.” The report says the state “has one of the best criminal justice regimes in the South, though nationally it is only 18th on this front.” It says gun rights are more restricted than many other southern states, and notes the pistol permit purchase requirement being removed this year. The report says North Carolina is No. 12 in educational freedom. Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers:'}]"

Duke is tied with the California Institute of Technology in this year’s edition. Princeton University ranked first for the 13th year running, followed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Stanford University and Yale University. The University’s ranking boost comes as U.S. News revamped its ranking methodology. In this year’s edition, factors such as alumni giving rates, percentage of faculty with a terminal degree, class sizes and admitted student class rank have been eliminated from the ranking score. Instead, U.S. News now places “increased weighting [to] a school’s success in graduating students from different backgrounds.” The new ranking methodology comes on the heels of universities withdrawing from U.S. News’ law and medical school rankings. In December 2022, Duke’s School of Law withdrew from U.S. News’ law school rankings, following the suit of several other top 14 law schools. Kerry Abrams, dean of the law school, cited serious concerns about “design and influence of these rankings.” Duke’s School of Medicine withdrew in January 2023, with school leadership citing issues with the “value and validity of the rankings.” Some critics of rankings hoped that universities would withdraw from the undergraduate versions. Not many did, however. This year, 99 out of the top 100-ranked universities provided data to U.S. News. The New York Times reported that of universities in which at least one professional school withdrew from the rankings, few, including Duke, were willing to comment on their decision to partake in undergraduate rankings. This year, Duke ranks just behind the University of Pennsylvania, which is slated in at No. 6. Behind Duke are Brown University, Northwestern University and Johns Hopkins University, tied for No. 9. Last year, Duke was tied with Northwestern and Johns Hopkins outranked Duke at seventh place. Brown, on the other hand, entered the top 10 for the first time since the 1998-99 edition. This is Duke’s highest ranking since 2014. In the 2021-22 edition of the rankings, Duke was ranked ninth, following a dip to 12th in the 2020-21 edition. In the 2019-20 rankings, Duke was No. 10. In 2018, Duke was No. 9, and from 2015-2018, the University ranked eighth. Much of the structure of the rest of the top 20 schools has changed. Behind Duke are Cornell University, Columbia University and the University of Chicago, all tied for No. 12. This year is Columbia’s second consecutive year outside the top 10. Last year, Columbia dropped 16 spots after one of its math professors found discrepancies in data that was provided to U.S. News, and the university admitted to providing incorrect information. UChicago also leaves the top 10 for the first time since 2006-07, and Dartmouth College has the lowest ranking in its history at No. 18. Public universities have also risen in this year’s rankings. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is ranked No. 22 this year, which marks an increase of 7 spots. The University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, Los Angeles, which are now tied at No. 15, rank inside the top 20 for the first time in over 20 years. Wake Forest University dropped 18 spots to No. 47 and N.C. State rose 12 spots to No. 60. In the Best National Universities ranking, U.S. News rates colleges and universities that “offer a full range of undergraduate majors, plus master's and Ph.D. programs.” Nearly 1,500 universities were evaluated, and 439 made the list this year.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 2:12 am Lincoln County has purchased the former Lincolnton AMC theater complex and accompanying property at a cost of $850,000. The theater at the six-acre site has been vacant for several years. In their final meeting prior to Thanksgiving, the Lincoln County Board of Commissioners received what one official termed “a very good Christmas present.” The commissioners were also in a buying mood Monday, approving a resolution to purchase the old Lincolnton AMC theater property at 2200 North Aspen Street, Lincolnton. The Christmas present, so labeled by presenter John Dancoff of the Lincoln County Economic Development Association, is an investment of $227 million by Bosch over the next two years at the Indian Creek Industrial Park along Riverview Road. Of the $227 million, just over $207 million qualifies for the Lincoln County Industrial Incentive Grant program, according to Dancoff. The construction and expansion project promises to generate 74 jobs within two years at an average wage of $51,000 including benefits. The county’s agreement is to provide Bosch with $983,000 in cash grant money annually for a period of eight years, which makes it a Level IV industrial grant under the program, Dancoff said. “I am absolutely astonished at the amount of money that Bosch is willing to invest in Lincoln County, and we couldn’t be happier,” Commissioner Anita McCall said. As to the old theater, which has been vacant for several years, the county will close on the property by the end of the year at a cost of $850,000, county attorney Megan Gilbert announced. County facilities manager John Henry gave the board a rundown on the property, noting that the 6.6 acres breaks down to 2.3 acres of parking lot, 3.3 acres of wooded area, along with a 21,000 square foot building that housed the theater. The theater opened in 1977, according to Henry, and was subject to an expansion in 1986. The building houses eight individual theaters and a projection mezzanine. Henry said the metal roof portion of the structure needs attention, and six of the eight HVAC units are more than 30 years old. Commissioner Carrol Mitchem asked Henry about the availability of a stage in the building. “I didn’t know if I would like to have a concert or something, maybe a singing,” Mitchem said. Henry answered that the theater does not have a stage at any of the eight projection venues, but that one could be constructed. “If you are going to sing, we will build one,” Henry quipped. “Well, don’t worry about that right now,” Mitchem said. In the county manager’s report, Davin Madden commented on the purchase, noting that the county is “looking at options that will give us a little more flexibility in how we utilize our space.” Interviewed after the meeting, Henry said the county has the option to renovate the theater to fit a need, or to tear it down. In action related to public utilities, the board agreed to hire Gavel & Dorn, a local engineering firm, to conduct the design phase for the N.C. 150 West Waterline Replacement Project. Mike Simmons, county public utilities manager, said the project objective is to replace a section of water main that has been prone to breaks due to age and materials, sometimes resulting in loss of water to an area school, a restaurant, and some residences. The contract with Gavel & Dorn covers design, permitting, bidding, and construction inspection/administration for a fee of $526,000. Simmons estimated the design phase will take six months, with another six-to-nine months for the water main installation. Elsewhere, the commissioners approved a resolution to accept $18.5 million in American Rescue Plan (ARP) grants from the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality for the construction of utility lines at the Riverbend Preserve. The Riverbend Preserve project along N.C. 16 between Lincoln and Gaston counties calls for 2.5 million square feet of industrial space and hundreds of homes, according to the Charlotte Business Journal. Furthermore, the board approved two appointments to local boards, Chip Sain for a second term on the ABC Board and John Ballard for a second term to the Lincoln County Environmental Review Board. In public comments, only one person addressed the board: Alan Hoyle of 319 North Poplar Street, Lincolnton. Hoyle, who described himself as a U.S. Marine with specialized training in nuclear and biological weaponry, presented to board chair Mitchem a resolution demanding that the county stop “distribution, access and administration” of COVID-19 vaccines, seize vaccine inventory, and investigate injuries and deaths from the “virus and shot (vaccine).” Hoyle’s resolution spanned nine pages and his list of 81 researched references covered eight pages of documentation.
