The sit-down will mark the first time a member of the Western media will interview the Russian president since his country’s invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war between the two countries that has resulted. The Kremlin confirmed the interview had happened on Wednesday. “We are not encouraging you to agree with what Putin may say in this interview,” Carlson said in a video posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “But we are urging you to watch it. You should know as much as you can. And then, like a free citizen and not a slave, you can decide for yourself.” The interview will be posted Thursday, according to Justin Wells, head of programming at Carlson’s streaming network. It’s not known what was said in the interview. Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters that Carlson was chosen for the interview because “he has a position which differs” from other English-language media. During his four-minute announcement, Carlson blasted the American media and U.S. government for what he described as blind support for Ukraine in its war effort. Carlson has for years been critical of U.S. involvement in the conflict, the Ukrainian government and its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, with whom he said he has also requested an interview. Speaking from what appeared to be an elevated balcony in Moscow, Carlson acknowledged what he called “risks to conducting an interview like this,” and noted he and his crew paid for the trip to Moscow themselves and did not take any financial assistance from government groups to travel. A former pundit at Fox News, Carlson was pulled off the air by the network last spring and has since launched his own media company and new program on X. He said Elon Musk, who owns the social media platform, has promised not to “censor” or suppress the interview with Putin in any way, which Carlson said will not be placed behind a paywall.

This hearing was expected to include conversations surrounding Allen’s additional charges as well as the contempt of court issue against the defense. Original Story: CARROLL COUNTY, Ind. — Before Monday’s hearing, Andrew Baldwin and Bradley Rozzi, the attorneys for Richard Allen, are responding to claims brought forward by the prosecution that they should be held in contempt of court, stating that those claims should be thrown out. According to court documents filed in Carroll County on Wednesday, Baldwin’s and Rozzi’s attorney said the state lacks standing for both to be held in contempt of court. Baldwin and Rozzi are representing Allen, a man who was charged in the February 2017 homicide of Abby Williams and Libby German in Delphi. This comes after the Carroll County prosecutor filed documents in late January, stating that he believes Baldwin and Rozzi should be held in contempt of court. According to previous reports, the prosecutor provided 25 points within the filing surrounding Baldwin and Rozzi’s conduct as to why they should be held in contempt, including: According to previous reports, Special Judge Fran Gull called for the removal of Baldwin and Rozzi after an evidence leak. The two attorneys later resigned, but then fought for reinstatement on the case. Baldwin and Rozzi were reinstated on Jan. 18. “The state’s information has many flaws,” the response reads. “Not least among them is its failure to allege, either directly or by inference, either Mr. Baldwin or Mr. Rozzi committed any of the supposed offending acts willfully.” In its response, Baldwin and Rozzi’s counsel asks for the court do “summarily deny” the request to hold the two in contempt. The attorneys argue why neither a civil contempt or criminal contempt ruling would be relevant in this case. The defense argues that none of what Baldwin and Rozzi reportedly committed would have harmed the state and the actions were not done intentionally. The defense states that the state lacks standing to pursue civil contempt because the state has not alleged “an injury a civil contempt sanction can remedy.” The documents state that even if the court reported each allegation as true, no sanction imposed for any of the acts would remedy an injury to the state. Even if the prosecution filed a criminal contempt motion, the defense argues that the state would have no authority to impose a criminal sanction. The documents said that the state filed its information “in the wrong place” and an action for indirect criminal contempt “must ‘be filed as an independent action.'” “The court simply may not impose any punitive sanction for what could only be a finding of criminal contempt in this criminal case against Mr. Allen,” the documents read. “That would amount to a conviction and punishment on a charge the state has not made.” According to previous reports, Gull set a hearing for Monday morning in Fort Wayne in relation to the contempt of court filing, along with the additional charges filed against Allen.

While you may be tempted to eat them, they could be deadly for some. Spring 2024 will bring with it an ultra-rare occurrence. For the first time in 221 years, Brood XIII and Brood XIX will emerge simultaneously across parts of the country, including Illinois. The last time Brood XIII and Brood XIX emerged it was 1803, according to Cicadia Mania. While the two broods will emerge across several states including Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee, there is one place in Illinois where both Brood XIX and Brood XII are expected to overlap and emerge at the exact same time. If you want to experience this, Cicadia Mania says you\'ll want to head to the state\'s capitol of Springfield. Brood XIII (13) is a 17-year cicada that includes three different species. They are found in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Brood XIX (19) is a 13-year cicada and is found in a number of states including Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and more. Sometimes known as ""the Great Southern Brood,"" there are four different species in Brood XIX. Can you eat cicadas? The short answer, for most people, is yes. The National Wildlife Federation says that people who have eaten periodical cicadas say they ""taste similar to canned asparagus."" Over at FoodNetwork, they advise that you cook cicadas rather than eating them raw to avoid contracting any food-borne (or insect-borne) pathogens. They describe the taste of cicadas as having ""nutty flavor"" and a ""shrimp-like quality."" That being said, if you happen to have an allergy to shrimp or lobster, you might be allergic to cicadas as well. In a tweet from 2021 during another cicada brood emergence, the FDA even warns against eating them if you have a shellfish allergy. Shellfish, and cicadas, are considered crustaceans and they fall into what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says are the eight food groups that cause the most serious reactions for those suffering from an allergy. Since those with a severe shellfish allergy could go into anaphylaxis if they were to ingest cicadas, those individuals should steer clear. As for the rest of us... bon appétit!?!

Mexico, the Casa Arco Iris migrant shelter is unassuming. That\'s on purpose. Not so long ago, its exterior was graffitied with a homophobic slur. Casa Arco Iris, or Rainbow House, offers refuge for gay and trans migrants headed to the United States. Thousands of migrants have sought asylum in America in the last few years, fleeing violence and persecution. LGBT refugees are often more low profile, and advocates say there\'s a reason for that: while other migrants find support in their respective communities here in the U.S., this is a group that often gets shunned and attacked. At Arco Iris the environment is cozy, but the mood is apprehensive. Sitting in the living room, curtains drawn, a group — mostly from Central America — is watching a video tutorial on how to get an interview to request asylum with U.S. Customs And Border Protection. The idea is to encourage people to come to the U.S. legally, rather than just cross the border. ""On average,"" the speaker says, ""people have to wait a few weeks."" This elicits laughter. Everyone here has been waiting for months. One guy, named Rivas, has been waiting for half a year. ""I feel desperate. Desperate,"" he says. ""It\'s like playing the lottery with your life."" Rivas asked that we not use his last name because he was threatened in his native Guatemala for being gay. It got so bad, he tried living in neighboring Mexico. But as drug cartels moved in, the harassment got unbearable. He heard he could get asylum in the U.S. Rivas says he would never cross without papers. The thought of getting caught and deported back home terrifies him. ""I would never do that."" Andrea Gonzalez Vera, the co-founder of Arco Iris, says Rivas\' story is common. She says drug cartels and gangs tend to be deeply homophobic. ""The LGBT community is a very specific target for organized crime,"" she says. Like Rivas, most LGBT asylum-seekers she\'s worked with don\'t want to cross the border undocumented. ""If you fail and you get deported, that could mean losing your life in your country of origin."" But that slur graffitied on the outside of Arco Iris is a reminder that it\'s not safe for people like Rivas to stay put for very long. Persecution due to sexual orientation is grounds to apply for asylum in the U.S., although there is almost no official data on how many asylum-seekers make that claim. But there are non-profits working with this group of people. The LGBT Asylum Task Force provides housing and a stipend until asylum-seekers can get work authorization. This is key, says co-founder Pastor Judy Hanlon, because by the time LGBT asylum-seekers come to her, they\'ve often been ostracized and even brutalized in their own communities in America. ""They have beaten them. They have raped them. Here in the United States. I can\'t even tell you the stories. So they\'re not safe with their people. So it\'s just triple marginalized,"" Hanlon says. Years ago, folks were mostly coming with visas, and then requesting asylum. Many were from from Jamaica and Uganda, where homosexuality is criminalized and severely punished. But increasingly, Hanlon is hearing from folks from around the world who are waiting on the border, or have already crossed it and are detained. ""I\'ve got people calling me from detention every day"", says Hanlon, from Hadwen Congregational Church in Massachusetts. ""Asking me to write letters to get them out of detention. They went over the border. They\'re LGBT."" The United Nations says there\'s been a historic rise in displaced people in the world, and on the border, and it shows: these days it\'s filled with migrants from China, Turkey, Russia and the Caribbean. In the course of a weekend NPR met LGBT asylum seekers hailing from Central America and Colombia. People like Dylan Villa. I met Villa in California, she had crossed just a few minutes ago, through a gap in the U.S.-Mexico border wall. She was resting up against one of its rust-colored beams. She had long black hair down to her waist and her eyes were bloodshot with exhaustion. Dylan is 22. She called me \'mor, or love, as people from northwest Colombia often do. She told me when she was 11, her family kicked her out for being gay, and that she\'d been living with friends and on the streets ever since. ""I\'ve had to run, and hide"", she continued, ""because someone would tell me, \'So-and-so is looking for you. He says there\'s no room for f****** in this town."" But she wasn\'t always able to get away. She shows me scars from stab wounds all over her body. She just couldn\'t do it anymore, she says. Then someone told her the U.S. was safer for people like her. She has a cousin in Boston, who was nice to her when she was a kid. Our conversation was cut short by Border Patrol agents rounding migrants up to bus off to a processing center. I assumed I wouldn\'t see her again. But a few weeks later, Villa texted me. She had made it to Boston. To her cousin\'s house. We met at a Colombian fast food joint, filled with families eating arepas and drinking tinto. Villa already seemed to be a regular here. I noticed that despite her appearance, some people called her boy. It was noisy, but when Dylan talked, she lowered her voice a little. She said she was embarrassed by this next part. At the border, after we spoke, she said, Border Patrol separated men and women. She told the agent she was a woman. She says he responded, ""In the U.S., unless it\'s cut off, you\'re a man, and you go with the men."" Villa says she had a panic attack. She was placed in detention alone. She says the cleaning staff would call her homophobic slurs, and make vomiting noises when they saw her. A few days later, she was released with a notice to appear in immigration court in March. In response to inquiries, Customs And Border Protection directed NPR to its National Standards On Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search. They instruct that before placing people in detention, they assess: ""whether the detainee has self-identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex, or gender nonconforming; Whether the detainee has self-identified as having previously experienced sexual victimization; The detainee\'s risk of being sexually abused by other detainees."" Basically, to initiate deportation proceedings. I asked if she was going to try to get asylum. ""Asylum."" She repeats. She says she doesn\'t know what that is, or how you get it. People like Rivas might be stuck waiting indefinitely on the Mexico side of the border, but some like Villa are caught in a legal limbo. Her deportation proceedings could take years. She can still apply for asylum, but her chances are slimmer because she crossed undocumented. But Villa says she not going to bother applying. She needs to focus on finding work. Starting a life. Even if it\'s only for a while. Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.'}]"

White the White House agreed with the decision that chargers were not warranted, a letter, lawyers for the president said ""we disagree with a number of inaccurate and inappropriate comments in the Special Counsel\'s report"" on the classified documents, including what it called ""highly prejudicial language"" to describe the president\'s memory. White House lawyer Richard Sauber said the report shows that Biden cooperated with the investigation and said ""mistakes when packing documents ... are unfortunately a common occurrence."" He said that Biden would take ""new, substantive action to help prevent such mistakes in the future"" but did not say what that action would be. Hur\'s decision not to pursue charges against the president brings an end to a lengthy investigation that began after Biden\'s lawyers found classified documents in November 2022 in the offices of the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C. Biden\'s personal attorneys turned over those materials, which were said to date to his time as vice president, to the National Archives and Records Administration. Federal agents then found a small number of additional classified documents in a search of Biden\'s home in Wilmington, Del. Agents also searched Biden\'s vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., but did not turn up any sensitive materials. Hurwas appointed as special counselto investigate the matter in January 2023. Hur\'s report zeroes in on two buckets of classified materials in particular: documents about military and foreign policy in Afghanistan, and notebooks with Biden\'s handwritten notes about national security and foreign policy issues. The documents about Afghanistan are from the fall of 2009, the report says, and were found in a box in Biden\'s Delaware garage. The materials marked classified were found along with drafts of the handwritten 2009 Thanksgiving memo that Biden sent then-President Obama to try to persuade Obama not to send more troops to Afghanistan. ""These material were proof of the stand Mr. Biden took in what he regarded as among the most important decisions of his vice presidency,"" the report says. The handwritten notebooks, meanwhile, were found by FBI agents in unlocked drawers in the office and basement den of Biden\'s home in Delaware. The report says the evidence shows Biden knew the notebooks contained classified information. And yet, Biden read entries aloud to his ghostwriter, according to the report. ""At least three times Mr. Biden read from classified entries aloud to his ghostwriter nearly verbatim,"" the report says. It adds that evidence suggests Biden knew he was not allowed to keep classified handwritten notes at home after leaving office, but prosecutors do not believe the evidence was strong enough to show at trial that Biden intended to break the law. ""We expect that Mr. Biden\'s defense at trial would be that he thought his notebooks were his personal property and he was allowed to take them home, even if they contained classified information,"" the report says. ""During our interview of him, Mr. Biden was emphatic, declaring that his notebooks are \'my property\' and that \'every president before me has done the exact same thing.\' "" Hur in his report described Biden as ""a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory"" and said it would have been ""difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him ... of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness"" in his retention of classified Afghanistan documents. The report described Biden having trouble remembering timelines and details. Democrats had hoped the investigation would wrap up quickly so it would not become an issue in the presidential campaign. Instead, the probe lasted more than a year, and Hur\'s report now lands as Biden looks set to square off in the 2024 campaign in a rematch with former President Donald Trump. Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence were embroiled in their own classified documents mishaps. Pence\'s case concluded quickly with no criminal charges filed. Trump, on the other hand, is facing more than three dozen federal criminal charges after boxes of classified material were uncovered in unsecure locations at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Fla. Trump and his associates have pleaded not guilty in the federal case, which is being prosecuted by special counsel Jack Smith. Prosecutors allege that Trump had a direct hand in packing the material as he left the White House in 2021 and pushed his attorneys to mislead the FBI about what documents he had in his possession. While both the Trump and Biden cases involve the retention of classified documents, there are significant differences between the two. Biden\'s attorneys quickly returned the materials, and cooperated with investigators. Trump, in contrast, is accused of willfully keeping the records and actively trying to obstruct officials from recovering them. The special counsel report Thursday also noted this distinction. ""It is not our role to assess the criminal charges pending against Mr. Trump, but several material distinctions between Mr. Trump\'s case and Mr. Biden\'s are clear,"" the report said. ""Unlike the evidence involving Mr. Biden, the allegations set forth in the indictment of Mr. Trump, if proven, would present serious aggravating facts."" Copyright 2024 NPR.

Mojo Nixon fused the fire of punk with the twang of rockabilly and the stage presence of an agitated carnival barker. LEILA FADEL, HOST: He was a hit on college radio in the 1980s and \'90s with a series of novelty songs like this one, ""Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant With My Two-Headed Love Child."" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""DEBBIE GIBSON IS PREGNANT WITH MY TWO-HEADED LOVE CHILD"") MOJO NIXON: (Singing) Debbie Gibson is pregnant with my two-headed love child. It\'s a bigfoot baby all covered in fur now. INSKEEP: Nixon\'s greatest successes came when he served as a provocateur. He berated a rock legends solo output with this song, ""Don Henley Must Die."" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""DON HENLEY MUST DIE"") NIXON: (Singing) He\'s a tortured artist, used to be in the Eagles. Now he whines like a wounded beagle. INSKEEP: Ow. FADEL: (Laughter). INSKEEP: Go on. FADEL: Luckily for Nixon, Don Henley had a sense of humor about it. He once joined Nixon stage to perform the song with him. Nixon told the Austin Chronicle, quote, ""I was surprised he was so magnanimous and that he didn\'t punch me."" INSKEEP: (Laughter) Now, Mr. Nixon was born Neill Kirby McMillan Jr. in North Carolina. He eventually moved to San Diego, where he became part of a duo, Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper. Nixon told NPR in 1989 that becoming a rock star was about his only career option. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) NIXON: I really couldn\'t do anything else. Like, I went to college, and I was supposed to go to law school and all this stuff. And I tried doing that and I just derailed. It just, you know - this is just one way to keep me out of prison, I think. FADEL: His biggest hit was fueled by MTV exposure in 1987, and it was a tribute to a kindred spirit. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ELVIS IS EVERYWHERE"") NIXON: When I look out into your eyes out there, when I look out into your faces, you know what I see? I see a little bit of Elvis in each and every one of you out there. Let me tell you, well, (singing) Elvis is everywhere. Elvis is everything. Elvis is everybody. Elvis is still the king. INSKEEP: A little bit of country preacher in that delivery. Rolling Stone magazine reports that Mojo Nixon suffered a cardiac event and died yesterday aboard the Outlaw Country Cruise, which is an annual music cruise that he co-hosted and where he performed. He was 66. His family said in a statement, quote, ""since Elvis is everywhere, we know he was waiting for him in the alley out back."" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ELVIS IS EVERYWHERE"") NIXON: Say, Elvis, heal me. Save me, Elvis. Make me be born again in the perfect Elvis light. That\'s right, you got that Elvis inside of you and he\'s talking to you. He says he wants you to sing. Everybody gotta sing like the king. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

It is Putin’s first interview to a Western media figure since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago.

The interview will be posted Thursday, according to Justin Wells, head of programming at Carlson’s streaming network. It’s not known what was said in the interview. Putin has heavily limited his contact with international media since he launched the war in Ukraine in February 2022. Russian authorities have cracked down on media, forcing some independent Russian outlets to close, blocking others and ordering a number of foreign reporters to leave the country. Two journalists working for U.S. news organizations — The Wall Street Journal’s Evan Gershkovich and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Alsu Kurmasheva — are in jail on charges they reject. Western journalists were invited to Putin’s annual press conference in December — the first since the war began — but only two were given the chance to ask a question. Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters that Carlson was chosen for the interview because “he has a position which differs” from other English-language media.

Trump has pushed to cut off aid to Ukraine, and the GOP majority controlling the House of Representatives has complied. While many Republicans are critical of the Russian president and his invasion, Trump and others have argued the United States has no interest helping Ukraine defend itself. Carlson has also traveled to interview Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has fashioned himself into an icon for conservative populists across the globe and been Putin’s closest ally in the European Union.

The sit-down will mark the first time a member of the Western media will interview the Russian president since his country’s invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war between the two countries that has resulted. The Kremlin confirmed the interview had happened on Wednesday. “We are not encouraging you to agree with what Putin may say in this interview,” Carlson said in a video posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “But we are urging you to watch it. You should know as much as you can. And then, like a free citizen and not a slave, you can decide for yourself.” The interview will be posted Thursday, according to Justin Wells, head of programming at Carlson’s streaming network. It’s not known what was said in the interview. Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters that Carlson was chosen for the interview because “he has a position which differs” from other English-language media. During his four-minute announcement, Carlson blasted the American media and U.S. government for what he described as blind support for Ukraine in its war effort. Carlson has for years been critical of U.S. involvement in the conflict, the Ukrainian government and its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, with whom he said he has also requested an interview. Speaking from what appeared to be an elevated balcony in Moscow, Carlson acknowledged what he called “risks to conducting an interview like this,” and noted he and his crew paid for the trip to Moscow themselves and did not take any financial assistance from government groups to travel. A former pundit at Fox News, Carlson was pulled off the air by the network last spring and has since launched his own media company and new program on X. He said Elon Musk, who owns the social media platform, has promised not to “censor” or suppress the interview with Putin in any way, which Carlson said will not be placed behind a paywall.

""We\'re putting the fraudsters behind these robocalls on notice."" Last month in New Hampshire, a robocall using an apparently AI-generated voice depicting President Biden discouraging Democrats from voting reached thousands of voters just days before the state\'s primary. New Hampshire\'s attorney general said this week a Texas telemarketer was behind the call, and that another Texas-based company transmitted it. He\'s opened an investigation into illegal voter suppression. AI has also been used to extort money from families by mimicking the voice of a loved one in danger. Last year the Federal Trade Commission warned consumers those scams are on the rise. Rapidly advancing technology has led to the wide proliferation of tools that can easily generate realistic audio, video, and images. That\'s raised fears over how the technology can be abused to dupe people and create plausible-seeming evidence of events that never happened. The FCC\'s ruling deemed calls made with AI-generated voices ""artificial"" under a 1991 federal law aimed at curbing junk calls. It means the FCC can fine violators and block the telephone companies that carry the calls. In addition, the ruling lets victims sue robocallers that use AI, and gives state attorneys general additional tools to prosecute bad actors. Copyright 2024 NPR.

The wild horses were being captured during a federal roundup in northern Nevada led by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Nevada has the largest population of wild horses. The BLM began the East Pershing Wild Horse Gather on Dec. 28, according to its website. The area, located between Lovelock and Winnemucca, Nevada, covers more than 2.1 million acres. The BLM stated that 2,875 wild horses needed to be removed to restore an “ecological balance and multiple-use relationship on public lands.” Critics have argued that the government is appeasing ranchers for their cattle. As of Jan. 29, the BLM reported that 24 wild horses had died and 2,048 had been captured. Observers for the group “Wild Horse Education” regularly monitor these types of operations. “Roundups need to stop until BLM creates an enforceable welfare policy,” the group posted on its website. The video also shows a helicopter flying close to the wild horses during several chases. Documents reviewed by KLAS revealed that a contract for $690,000 was awarded to Shayne Sampson of Utah for the East Pershing Wild Horse Gather. When reached by phone on Tuesday, Sampson referred the inquiry to the BLM and then hung up on the reporter. On Jan. 24, Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) and Rep. Steven Cohen (D-TN) asked BLM Director Tracy Stone-Manning to pause the East Pershing Complex gather operation. In a letter, they pointed to 20 horse deaths in less than a month and stated it “has further demonstrated persisting faults in BLM’s wild horse strategy.” Titus and Cohen also expressed concerns about BLM’s Tentative Wild Horse and Burro Gather and Fertility Control Schedule which includes gathering nearly 21,000 horses compared to the nearly 7,000 scheduled for roundups in 2023. The plan for the new fiscal year included roundups throughout New Mexico, Nevada, Wyoming, California, Arizona, Utah and Colorado. Titus and Cohen also criticized the use of helicopters. Some wild horse advocates have pushed for fertility control. According to the BLM, no wild horses in the East Pershing Wild Horse Gather will be treated with fertility control. Wild horses captured during the gathering are brought to a corral where they can then be adopted or sold, according to the BLM. Titus introduced a bill in 2022 to ban the use of helicopters. In May of 2023, the “Wild Horse and Burro Protection Act” was introduced into Congress marking the first step of the legislative process. The following month, it was referred to the Subcommittee on Federal Lands. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
