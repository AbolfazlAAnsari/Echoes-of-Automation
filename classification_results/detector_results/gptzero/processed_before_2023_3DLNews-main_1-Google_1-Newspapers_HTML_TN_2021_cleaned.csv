Americans, including nearly half of Asian Americans, in recent weeks have seen someone blame Asian people for the coronavirus epidemic, a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll finds. The nationwide survey was taken Thursday and Friday in the wake of last week\'s mass shooting in Georgia that killed eight people, six of them women of Asian descent. Reports across the country of physical assaults and verbal abuse against Asian Americans have jumped during the yearlong pandemic. ""My friend went to the supermarket and got bullied,"" said Pong Rattanakosum, 45, a health care worker from Los Angeles and an American of Thai descent who was polled. When he heard about the shooting in Georgia, ""I felt, like, anger, and also anxious,"" he said in a follow-up interview. While a 57% majority of Americans describe the coronavirus pandemic as a natural disaster, 43% say they believe a particular organization or people is responsible. In response to an open-ended question, most in that group specified China, comprising nearly 1 in 4 of the total survey. The online poll of 1,195 adults has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. ""China released it, so the buck has to stop there,"" said Joanne Von Prisk, 78, a retired customer service manager from Sun City, Arizona, who is white. ""I don\'t know ... that it was accidental or it was intentional. It should have been contained and dealt with there."" There were sharp partisan differences in perceptions. Republicans were more than twice as likely as Democrats to hold a specific group or organization responsible for the pandemic. And Democrats were almost twice as likely as Republicans to report having witnessed Asian people being blamed for the pandemic in the past month. Among the 25% of those surveyed who said they had seen someone blaming Asian people for the pandemic, race and ethnicity were a divide as well: 18% of white Americans, 34% of Hispanic Americans, 40% of Black Americans and 46% of Asian Americans said they had witnessed such incidents. ""A year into the coronavirus pandemic, and Americans continue to blame China for the outbreak, particularly Republicans,"" said Cliff Young, president of Ipsos. ""With such ongoing scapegoating, it is not a surprise that 1 in 4 Americans report seeing anti-Asian harassment."" An academic study published in the American Journal of Public Health last week showed the effect of then-President Donald Trump labeling the pandemic the ""Chinese virus"" during its early weeks. When he first used the hashtag #chinesevirus on Twitter in March 2020, the number of people using it exploded, and they were much more likely to use explicitly anti-Asian hashtags than those who used #covid19 in tweets. ""The previous administration, you know, they would openly say \'Chinese virus,\'"" said Shirin Bhasin, 44, of Milwaukee, an Indian American who works in human resources. She was among those surveyed. ""So they have sort of instilled in people that it\'s to do with China, it\'s to do with the Chinese people."" Reports of violence have exposed bias against Asian Americans that has long existed but not always been recognized, she said. ""It has brought more awareness, and people who were just living under the rock thinking that there was no racism – some of my colleagues, their eyes have opened up."" More: Many Americans of color call for unity against white supremacy after Atlanta killings But Bobby Colvin, 74, a mango grower from Pahokee, Florida, who is white, accuses the news media of hyping reports of attacks on Asian Americans. ""I haven\'t seen it,"" he said. ""I don\'t believe it at all."" A nonprofit group called Stop AAPI Hate reported nearly 3,800 incidents of anti-Asian hate in about a year since the pandemic emerged, including verbal harassment, physical assaults and civil rights violations. ""President Trump\'s insistence on the term \'Chinese virus\' clearly stigmatized Asians as disease-carriers,"" founder Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, told USA TODAY. ""Such words directed fear and anger towards Asian Americans and has led to the violence and deaths that we\'re grieving over."" In an Ipsos poll last April, one-third of those surveyed reported having seen Asians being blamed for the pandemic, 7 points higher than in the new survey. But the change in attitudes over the past year about coming into close contact with someone of Asian descent is complicated. The number who express fear about being near someone of Asian ancestry is relatively unchanged, at 21%. But the percentage concerned about being close to an Asian American who isn\'t wearing a mask or other protective gear rose 8 points, to a 54% majority. There was no such significant shift in views about being close to people in general who weren\'t wearing protective gear. Stefanie Brummitt, 33, of Mechanicsville, Maryland, who is white, calls the effort to blame Asians ""really ignorant,"" but she recognizes it is happening. ""My 9-year-old son told me he\'s not in school because it\'s China\'s fault and it\'s the Chinese people\'s fault,"" she said. ""I was livid.""'}]"

They almost became extinct.” However, the American buffalo, also known as bison, roams in the Buffalo Valley once again after the arrival of several buffaloes to the area thanks to Lynch’s efforts.

Visit our sister news site: www.ShorewoodNewsroom.com AUSTN, Texas (March 7, 2018) -- Chantal M. Eldridge, whose sister Darlene was murdered in an unprosecuted Cookeville arson fire 25 years ago, defeated incumbent David Crain by a better than 2-1 margin Tuesday and will succeed him on Texas\' 331st criminal court bench. Crain\'s shelf-life had passed the use-by date, Eldridge said in her campaign. After three decades on the bench, defendants with cases before Crain languished in jail more than four months awaiting trial, the longest of any of the felony courts in the county. According to unofficial returns, Eldridge beat Crain 69-31 percent, receiving more than double the votes for the incumbent, 68,105 to 30,225. Eldridge\'s experience with the justice system in Tennessee has given her a perspective few other candidates can match: her sister was murdered, dying 11 days after a November 11, 1992, arson fire. The investigation was botched, records were concealed and Eldridge\'s brother, Fabien, was prosecuted for beating up a suspect in the murder by a pair of local attorneys who stood to profit in a civil case if Fabien were convicted. Former District Attorney General William E. Gibson was disbarred in 2009 for an unethical relationship with a prisoner his office prosecuted, but was reinstated in 2016. Gibson, who had a disgraceful history as state prosecutor, has repeatedly denied he used cocaine with Darlene Eldridge or her former boyfriend, who was a suspect in the arson/murder. Meanwhile, according to Austin newspaper reports, Eldridge faced questions of her own concerning a 2006 Austin police investigation into allegations she had sex with a 16-year-old exchange student from Brazil who was living at her home. Police did not find facts sufficient to bring charges against Eldridge, who denied wrongdoing and accused Crain\x92s backers of \x93dirty politics\x94 for leaking information about the investigation. While the age of consent in Brazil is 14, that would not make her immune from prosecution if the unsubstantiated allegations were proved. June 26, 2013:""Tennessee Department of Corrections Commissioner Derrick Schofield asked the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to lead a probe into the circumstances of Looper\x92s death, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel. Russell Johnson, district attorney general for the 9th Judicial District, which includes Morgan County, approved the request. Details remained sketchy Wednesday afternoon, but the district attorney general said he was told corrections officers \x93had to restrain and remove Looper as a result of an incident possibly involving other inmates\x94 about 9 a.m. Wednesday, and Looper was taken for medical treatment before being placed in a medical isolation cell.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 2:47 am State regulators will revoke the franchise held by former cable service provider Spirit Broadband, LLC, after the county claimed the business’ application for the franchise authority was based on false and misleading information. “The Spirit Broadband LLC application … was filed under false and misleading pretenses and therefore should have never been granted and should now be revoked,” states a complaint filed by Cumberland County Attorney Philip Burnett with the Tennessee Public Utility Commission. Franchise agreements allow cable television providers to operate a cable system using the public right-of-way. In return, companies agree to pay franchise fees, comply with service standards, and provide other public benefits. The complaint was filed in January 2020. A hearing was held July 13. Burnett told the Cumberland County Commission during its July 19 meeting the state would grant the county’s request. “They’re not going to be eligible to service anything in Cumberland County once we get an order on that,” Burnett said. Burnett told the Chronicle that, to the best of his knowledge, Spirit Broadband no longer serves any customers in Cumberland County or elsewhere, but seeking revocation of the franchise agreement is critical to prevent the company from returning to the area to provide cable services in the future. With the allegations on file with the state, the action also makes it more difficult for Spirit Broadband or its chief executive Vincent King from applying for a certificate of franchise in the future. According to the complaint, Spirit Broadband purchased Midsouth Cable TV in 2007. Midsouth had a franchise agreement with the county, granted in 1999. That agreement did not allow the franchise to be assigned to another party without the county’s approval. Burnett writes that Spirit operated without a written agreement with the county from 2007 forward. Telecommunications providers can provide services to the public through a franchise license granted by the county or through a Certificate of Franchise Authority granted by the Tennessee Public Utility Commission. “The Petitioner [Cumberland County] allowed Spirit Broadband to continue providing cable and video services inside the Petitioner’s boundaries with the understanding that Spirit would abide by the agreement previously held with Midsouth Cable. Unfortunately, Spirit failed to pay franchise fees and on April 12, 2016, Petitioner was forced to file suit against Vincent King and Spirit Broadband,” the complaint continues. That lawsuit claimed Spirit Broadband failed to pay franchise fees from 2008 through 2015 and that King did not pay franchise fees from Dec. 10, 2015 through the date of the lawsuit. It also noted that the February 2015 ice storm damaged some of the company’s equipment, leaving residents without cable service. “Despite the county’s repeated requests for defendants to repair the equipment used by them to provide cable service to the county’s residents, they have failed and refused to do the same,” the 2016 lawsuit says. The county sought payment of the franchise fees and $1 million in punitive damages for “maliciously, recklessly and intentionally” violating the county’s rights. In 2018, Spirit agreed to pay $100,000 to settle the case. The county has not received any of the agreed-upon settlement funds. The county has hired two debt collectors to attempt to locate assets. Burnett said those efforts have been unsuccessful to date but the county will continue to seek payment. County Finance Director Nathan Brock told the Tennessee Public Utility Commission in January 2020 that the company had made no franchise payments or any other payments to the county since Oct. 12, 2017. As the lawsuit was progressing, King sought a new franchise agreement from the state. The county contends the application for that franchise certificate falsely claimed the company was an “incumbent cable service” under state law. That allowed the company to avoid a state review of its management, financial status and technical qualifications to provide cable and video service. “Had the department performed the managerial, financial, and technical qualification analysis, Spirit would never been granted the Certificate of Franchise Authority,” the complaint states. At the time of the application to the state, the company owed the county at least $100,000 in unpaid franchisee fees. Four months earlier, a federal tax lien was registered against the company for failure to pay self-employment taxes in the amount of $14,796.91. The company had been administratively dissolved by the state from Dec. 9, 2015 until April 26, 2016, though it continued to provide services. The Tennessee Secretary of State had filed a Notice of Determination against Spirit on Oct. 1, 2017, because the entity had failed to file an annual report. The state issued the company a Certificate of Franchise Authority on Oct.. 12, 2017. Seven weeks later, Spirit Broadband was again administratively dissolved, according to Secretary of State records, and did not beome active again until March 29, 2018. The company did not pay any franchise fees to the county after being issued a franchise certificate by the state. Another federal tax lien was filed against Spirit Broadband in January 2018 for $7,566.27 for failure to pay self-employment taxes. The state again administratively dissolved the company on Dec. 6, 2018, and it was dissolved again on Dec. 10, 2018, due to issues with labor and workforce development. “Since Dec. 10, 2018, Spirit Broadband, LLC has remained a dissolved Limited Liability Company and therefore has no legal ability to act as an entity in the state of Tennessee,” the complaint states. The Tennessee Public Utility Commission has not yet issued its written order regarding the franchise certificate, though Burnett said that could come this week. Burnett also reported that the transfer of ownership of the Cumberland Homesteads Tower on Hwy. 127 S. at Hwy. 68 from the Cumberland County school system to Cumberland County. The transfer was delayed as the county waited for a survey to be completed. Burnett said the quit-claim deed, signed by Cumberland County Director of Schools Ina Maxwell, had been delivered to him that day. Heather Mullinix is editor of the Crossville Chronicle.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 3:42 am Reporter Lee County physician Art Van Zee is shown with a photo of a Purdue Pharma marketing item given to doctors in the 1990s to promote its opioid painkiller — an OxyContin beach hat. Van Zee spoke at UVA on Wise Wednesday about the continuing impact of opioid addiction in Southwest Virginia. WISE — Dr. Art Van Zee first questioned the opioid OxyContin’s social effects on Southwest Virginia when he saw how it was marketed. Van Zee, cited in a mass of news articles, the book “Dopesick” and a nonfiction cable network adaptation of the book as a major alarm against OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma, shared three photos with an audience at UVA Wise on Wednesday as part of a lecture hosted by the college’s Center for Appalachian Studies. The photos — marketing materials circulated by Purdue Pharma sales representatives to encourage doctors to prescribe the opioid — included an OxyContin-branded pedometer, a compact disc of swing music with “Swing in the right direction with OxyContin,” and an OxyContin beach hat. More than two decades after Purdue Pharma started marketing OxyContin as a pain relief drug with a low risk of addiction, the Sackler family has put its company in bankruptcy and left federal and state court officials uncertain about aspects of a financial settlement to reimburse costs of addiction treatment. Van Zee said he came to St. Charles, Virginia, in 1976 after medical school at Vanderbilt University “with no interest, no training and no experience in addiction medicine.” By 2000, he had seen how Purdue Pharma was marketing its product and how people in his community were switching from abuse of Percocet and Lortab to readily available, higher potency and highly addictive OxyContin. Purdue Pharma used drug studies that claimed prescription opioids posed little risk of addiction in patients, Van Zee said, but those studies typically had no connection with reality. Percocet and Lortab were relatively easy to stop using, Van Zee said, but OxyContin has continued as a major addiction and health problem in the past two decades as Purdue Pharma’s marketing practices helped increase painkiller prescriptions in Southwest Virginia between 300% and 600%. “Basically I was being astonished at the misrepresentation and outright lies,” Van Zee said. In recent years, as OxyContin supplies became more restricted with various anti-prescription fraud efforts by law enforcement and state governments, Van Zee said methamphetamine and fentanyl use has risen. “The meth problem we have today is linked to the opioid crisis because people who remained in opioid abuse tried the next thing that came along,” said Van Zee. As he became familiar with addiction treatment from his own practice, Van Zee said he has found that medication assisted treatment — buprenorphine and methadone — are effective in dealing with opioid addiction when done properly. Long-term residential addiction treatment is also effective, he added. New Beginnings Southwest Virginia operated in Lee County for about eight years and showed promise in its long-term residential treatment model, Van Zee said, but closed due to a lack of grant funding. Van Zee said he prescribes suboxone — a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone — as part of an addiction treatment plan for patients. While effective, the drug has drawn attention from law enforcement agencies as they seize more of it, along with other drugs, Van Zee noted. “What law enforcement doesn’t see is all the people that have been helped,” Van Zee said, adding that its growing presence in drug seizures is because many drug users take it to be able to function after using other drugs. With Virginia poised to receive $530 million of a $26 billion opioid settlement with pharmaceutical companies, Van Zee said the state’s newly formed Opioid Abatement Authority should look at how the 1998 national settlement with the tobacco industry has been spent on health. By 2019, only 3% of $120 billion had been spent on tobacco-related health issues. A recent Oklahoma Supreme Court reversal of that state’s $465 million opioid settlement with Johnson & Johnson left Van Zee concerned. “I don’t know what the implications will be for the national settlement,” said Van Zee.
