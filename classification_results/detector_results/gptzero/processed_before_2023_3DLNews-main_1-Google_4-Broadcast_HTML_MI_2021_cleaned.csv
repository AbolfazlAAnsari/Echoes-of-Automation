There are similarities and major differences. You can get your news on your phone, on your TV, on a streaming device. But who is sending you that news can be vastly different. “Local news is strong in presenting factual cases of what’s actually going on,” says Dustin Carnahan, a Michigan State University Assistant Professor in Communications and Politics. Local news people are your neighbors. You see them on TV and at the grocery store. They understand what’s relevant. They build relationships and inside sources. Trust and credibility are their stock in trade. “Trust in the media has been a big and growing problem over the years. But one of the glimmers of hope is local news,” says Robert Yoon, a Visting Professor of Communications and Media at the University of Michigan and Associate Director of the Knight Wallace Fellowships for Journalists. Many websites and cable TV channels are not just different forms of news but also different business models. Cable news is on all day and night. They want your eyeballs there as long as possible by providing you information. “They have a lot of opinion on. They have people, sometimes experts, sometimes not very, that are just there to fill the time and share their ideas about things. They’re not held accountable for those ideas,” says Amanda Lotz, who does a Podcast on How Cable Transformed Television and is a Professor at Queensland University of Technology. The election is where you could see it all, different angles, alternative facts, fake news, mainstream media. As the nation was divided so were your choices to get news. “There’s considerable risk in conflating all media together,” Professor Lotz says. Professor Carnahan goes further saying, “wow, we’re so detached from reality we are unwilling to accept truth when it runs against our goals or our values or world view.” And then there was the siege on the U. S. Capitol, “if we don’t have at least a common understanding of what is factual and what isn’t, we’re never going to be able to have constructive conversations about solutions and about different approaches to achieving hopefully the same goal. And I think that’s the one thing we have to remember, we all have the same goal. “Local news can play a big part in terms of combatting misinformation. Local news sources enjoy a much higher level of trust than national news sources,” says Professor Yoon. One more thing, social media is not necessarily news. It is what people post and what the algorithm thinks you want to see. Like cable TV, they want you on as long as possible to see their ads.'}]"

2021, thousands of Donald Trump supporters stormed the U-S Capital. They broke through windows. They attacked and hospitalized police officers. They beat one with an American flag. One insurrectionist was shot and killed by law enforcement as she tried climbing into the House chamber. The attack came after months of lies from then-President Trump and his supporters claiming that Joe Biden stole the election. He didn\'t. On December 19th, Trump tweeted, ""Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!"" The day of the attack, Trump held a rally not far from the U-S Capitol where lawmakers were certifying Biden as the winner. As the violence was taking place, Trump went onto twitter. Instead of asking for calm, he tweeted, ""The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!"" After immense pressure to speak out against the violence, trump eventually made a video, in which told the insurrectionists to go home, but that the election was stolen and they were \'very special people\' and that he loved them. The social media platforms had enough. That video and his tweets were pulled. His accounts were shut down and remain so to this day. Twitter put out a statement that said, ""After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence."" Twitter and Snapchat say he\'s done for good. And in a statement put out the afternoon of this podcasts publication, Facebook said Trump\'s account will be shutdown for two years... until January 6, 2023. The impact has been substantial. Zignal Labs - a California-based research firm - showed that - in the immediate days after Trump\'s banishment, misinformation about election fraud went down a whopping 73%. On the flip side, Data compiled by NewsWhip shows social media interactions about Trump are down 91% from January 6th (when he was booted) to May 3rd. The power these social media platforms have to remove someone from their platforms has raised a lot of questions and a lot of anger - particularly from the right side of the political spectrum, who feel they are being targeted unfairly. They claim their First Amendment rights are being violated. There\'s even a new law in one state to stop social media sites from de-platforming politicians. But, is this a First Amendment issue? Is it an ethical issue? Is it a larger problem with the way in which we a society now choose to dialogue with one another? In today\'s episode we talk with a Constitutional law expert... and a social media expert. Both will give us their thoughts on what\'s happening... what it means... and where we may be going from here. I\'m Nick LaFave. This is Alone At The Desk. This is Alone At The Desk with Nick LaFave. A podcast by an average, middle aged guy who just happens to be a TV news anchor. We talk exciting and the boring parts of life, the industry, and life in the industry. And we cover some important stories along the way. Brought to you by 13 On Your Side News in Grand Rapids, Michigan. If you mention the First Amendment to someone, most have a general idea of what it says. They think it means you have freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Beyond that, it can get a bit murky. There are actually five points in that Amendment, including religion, the press, peaceable assembly, and petitioning to the government for a redress of grievances. SCHINDLER ""But the core that we spend most of our time talking about freedom of speech, the idea that Congress will pass no law restricting the freedom of speech."" This is retired Constitutional Law professor Devin Schindler. SCHINDLER: ""Now, the first thing that jumped out at you. Firstly, it says Congress. What about the states, what about local municipalities? The court has ruled over the years that \'Congress\' really means government. It\'s called the process of corporation. So the first thing we have to do is take out the word Congress and put in the word government. So at a broad stroke basis, it stands for the proposition that government cannot unreasonably restrict speech."" We\'ll get to the big about ""Congress"" meaning ""government"" in a minute. First... most people don\'t stop to realize that every right we have has limits. We have the right to drive. But that can be taken away if you break the law often enough. Even our right to live can be taken away with the death penalty. Schindler says it\'s the same with speech - even though the First Amendment says ""Congress shall make no law."" SCHINDLER: ""If you read that literally, government couldn\'t do things like ban child pornography, cause that\'s a form of speech, if you wrote that literally government banned things like incitement; fighting words. So again, pretty early on in our constitution, District Court said ""well, when the Constitution said no law, it didn\'t really mean no law, government needs some ability to regulate speech in order to have a civilized society. We don\'t want to live in a society where child pornography is allowed."" So over the decades, there\'s been this constant balancing act between the desires of the founders to prevent government from restricting free speech, and the needs of running a civil society, which has led to a number of compromises, and some very, very unique holdings. It is a sui generis incredibly important complicated area of Constitutional law."" Back to ""Congress"" shall make no law meaning ""government"" shall make no laws. Because already one state has taken action against social media sites banning or limiting politicians. On May 24th, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis - a staunch ally of Trump\'s - signed a bill into law that would severely penalize platforms like Twitter and Facebook for de-platforming elected officials, and candidates in the state. Remember, Former President Trump\'s new permanent home is Mara Lago. Social media sites could be fined up to 250-thousand dollars per day for violating the law. LAFAVE: ""Okay, so here\'s the brass tacks question: is Facebook and or Twitter violating someone\'s free speech rights when they limit or ban them from posting, in your opinion? SCHINDLER: ""Categorically no. Because of that first word Congress shall make no law. the First Amendment and the Bill of Rights only restrict actions by the government. The government has to take an action of some form or other for the first amendment to even be implicated. Facebook, Twitter, the various social media outlets that are out there are non governmental. Therefore they are not subject to the First Amendment."" But, historically, there are different opinions on that distinction. Including those currently sitting on the Supreme Court. SCHINDLER: ""Well, it goes all the way back to a famous justice by the name of Justice Black who said, We the court shouldn\'t be balancing free speech against government, because the founders already did the balance wars. They wrote the words no law. And so, I would call those first amendment absolutists, the idea that the First Amendment means what it says, it\'s more of a textual approach looking at the text of the document, and the balance has already been done by the Founders, so that the court should not be in the business of creating new forms of unprotected speech, shouldn\'t be in the business of upholding laws that restrict speech, because the Constitution says what it says. There are also one jurist in particular Justice Thomas, who has argued that the First Amendment does not apply to the states that the states are free to do whatever they want to in terms of restricting speech. It simply acts as a limit on Congress."" Schindler says there also one wild card currently on the bench. Trump nominee Neal Gorsuch, who\'s written a number of opinions that take what Schindler calls a very absolute, textualist approach. SCHINDLER: ""The document says what it says, move on. What\'s, what he\'s going to do about the First Amendment is not entirely clear because there hasn\'t been a big First Amendment case that really goes to that issue yet. but certainly as we see the court becoming... I hate to say the word rightward leaning, you know I don\'t like that phraseology, but let\'s just say as it becomes more and more textualist judges on it, more originalist justices... It\'s entirely possible that we are going to see fewer First Amendment protections as time goes on."" There\'s another angle to this lawsuit. Generally, when people think of the First Amendment, they think that they can say what they want. In this case... government - specifically Florida - is telling these private companies that they'}]"

Here are 10 fun facts about Michelle. 1) Her Tribe (Not pictured and mad about it: Esme) Michelle’s biggest cheerleaders are her husband of 17 years, Kevin, her 13-year old daughter, Elle and their two golden doodles, DeeDee and Esmerelda. They love to travel and explore, visit museums, go to the theatre and try new restaurants, but they are also content cuddling up on the couch for movie nights during our long Michigan winters. Clearly, many of those are Star Wars movies. 2) She's Almost a Michigander (Rabbit Bay in the Keweenaw Peninsula, UP) Michelle was born and raised in the Chicago area but moved to northern Michigan in 2000 when she started as a reporter for 9&10 News, the CBS/FOX affiliate in Traverse City/Cadillac. So, while she’s not a true native, she’s spent nearly half her life in the Mitten, and loves it as if she was born here. Her favorites: the gorgeous, sandy beaches, the unbelievable views & vistas, hiking trails, waterfalls, sunrises & sunsets, the culture (and food!) in our fabulous cities and the friendly midwestern attitude. 3) For Better or for Worse (Preseason 2013, still looking for a ring) Michelle’s husband has always been a die-hard sports fan – from the Lions, Tigers and Pistons to U of M football and basketball, and it’s rubbed off on the rest of the family. They often attend games (home and away) – and hold out hope for some winning seasons. Her daughter was able to design a Lions Super Bowl ring during a visit to the NFL Hall of Fame. Because … the Lions. 4) Favorite Work Moments (Photo taken somewhere over Lake Michigan just before she passed out!) Michelle has been in the news business for nearly 22 years, so there are plenty of highlights. Her first job was in Dubuque, Ia. during the caucuses in 1998. She was able to interview many prominent politicians, including George W. Bush, before his presidential victory. In Michigan, she’s had plenty of incredible adventures. She’s ventured to the top and the bottom of the Mackinac Bridge, toured the inside of the Soo Locks, flown with the Blue Angels and is so grateful to have been able to share countless stories about amazing people. She feels privileged to be able to continue her career in West Michigan! (Photo taken somewhere over Lake Michigan just before she passed out!) 5) A Horse Girl at Heart (National Pleasure Equitation Olympics, Springfield, Ill. 1993) One of Michelle’s passions is horses. She was lucky enough to have the opportunity to ride and show several amazing American Saddlebreds as a teen and young adult. She won two national championships, got top ten at the World’s Championship Horse Show and made so many memories along the way. She credits the discipline it takes to work with horses for much of her successes as an adult. While she doesn’t ride nearly as much as she would like to, horses will live forever in her heart. 6) Life-changing Experiences (Patulul, Guatemala, 2017) While there have been many memorable moments in her career, she’s had one experience that will always stick out in her mind. She was able to travel with a photographer and a group of northern Michiganders on a medical mission trip to Guatemala. They spent several days shooting stories about the impact these volunteers have on the communities they serve. They were also able to pitch in and help treat some of the patients who have little to no access to medical care. These people (lots of whom were very sick or injured) walked miles to the clinics, waited for hours and still were so happy, so grateful and so kind. It will remain one of the most impactful experiences she’s ever had in her life thus far. 7) One Foot in Front of the Other (Cadillac McDonalds, 2017) One thing Michelle loves about being in the news business is the ability to use the platform for good. A few years ago, some great minds came up with a way to raise awareness and money for the Ronald McDonald House of Western Michigan -- have Michelle walk from the McDonalds in Traverse City to the McDonalds in Cadillac. 14 hours and nearly 50 miles later, the event raised almost $30,000 for the RMHWM. The next year, she cycled 100 miles to end at the tour at the RMHWM in Grand Rapids. It’s such a wonderful organization, and she’s looking forward to giving back to them in other ways, now that she’s a local! 8) The Gift of Service (Manistee Polar Plunge with her favorite leprechaun/EP, Jamie, 2018) Charity and nonprofit work is extremely important to Michelle – and she tries to be involved in a number of ways, from bell-ringing for the Salvation Army, to serving on both local and statewide boards. She is currently a board member for Special Olympics Michigan, an organization that is so close to her heart. You can often find her at a Polar Plunge, volunteering at games or emceeing events. She is excited to be so close to their new building (the Special Olympics Unified Sport and Inclusion Center - the largest SO training facility in the WORLD!) and to promote the athletes and volunteers. 9) Awards (Michigan Emmy Awards with the unbelievable Corey Adkins, 2012) Her first-ever award was from the Associated Press for best sports story – strange, because it was the only sports story she had ever done. Another stand out for her was the Michigan Association of Broadcasters Reporter of the Year in 2010. She’s most proud of her two Michigan Emmy Awards. Much of the credit for any accolade goes to the amazing photographers she’s had the pleasure of working with over the years (there have been many)! 10) For Fun! (Vík, Iceland, 2018) When she’s not working or momming, Michelle loves to work out – from strength training to running, riding and dog walking – it’s all therapy! She loves to cook for a group and find reasons to celebrate with friends. Traveling was a huge part of their lives before the pandemic, and she’s hoping to get moving again soon! Some of her favorite places include New Orleans, Italy, Portugal, Iceland and Costa Rica. She would love her next adventure to be somewhere she’s never been. For now, she’s more than content to embrace and explore her new community of West Michigan, get to know her new team and settle into her role at Fox 17!""}]"

(WILX) - If you’re driving into the Frandor shopping complex on Saginaw Hwy., you’ve likely passed a billboard that says, ‘Shoot a real machine gun.’ It’s for Range 517, a shooting range and shop about 9 miles west of Frandor. The billboard is starting a firestorm on the app Nextdoor, despite the fact the billboard has been up for several months. Some of the comments say the sign is offensive given the recent mass shootings in Boulder and Atlanta. Others say it promotes learning and gun safety classes. Range 517 general manager Chris Periatt says News 10′s request for an interview was the first time he’s heard the billboard was viewed as offensive. “They have a right to say that, but we have a right to put the billboard up as well,” Periatt said. East Lansing resident Monica Silva posted her displeasure with the billboard on Nextdoor too. She doesn’t want to see gun advertisements at all, this one included. “I’m wondering if there would be a way this community could have some power to decide whether they find it useful or offensive in a public display like that,” Silva said, The Range 517 billboard shows someone trying to teach a person how to use a gun, but the words, ‘education’, or ‘safety’, are not mentioned in the ad. “You have a right to express your opinion. That’s what the constitution gives you,” Periatt said of people with complaints. “But we also have the right to conduct our business.” Machine gun rental is one of Range 517′s special offerings. Periatt says it’s not common around here, and that’s why this specific ad exists. Silva though is tired of seeing this and other gun advertisements. “We abolished public displays of advertising for cigarettes for example,” Silva said. “Because we decided that it was not in the interest of the communities, and it was bad for the common good. For me, it is deeply offensive.” Despite the complaints from some, Periatt says Range 517 is not going to give in. “You have a right to be offended. That’s the great thing about this country, if you don’t like it, OK. But we’re not going to take it down,” he said. Copyright 2021 WILX. All rights reserved.

The Athletic said Riley has denied “the majority” of the allegations in its report. Attempts by Reuters to reach Riley for comment were unsuccessful. Play was halted six minutes into Washington Spirit’s game against NJ/NY Gotham FC at Suburu Park in suburban Philadelphia on Wednesday as both squads linked arms at the centre circle. The NWSL Players Association said the gesture was in recognition of the six years since former players Mana Shim and Sinead Farrelly came forward with allegations, “and all those who fought for too long to be heard”. Players stood in silence for a minute. “During that time, we ask you to stand in that pain and discomfort with us,” the statement read. The NWSLPA also outlined demands for the league, including that “every coach, general manager, representative on the board of governors and owner” submit to an independent investigation into abusive conduct. In Cary, North Carolina, where Riley led the Courage to a second consecutive NWSL title in 2019, the home team and visiting Racing Louisville delivered the same gesture. Riley has been fired by the Courage and the league. The allegations also led to the ouster of Commissioner Lisa Baird and prompted investigations by the NWSL, U.S. Soccer and FIFA. An hour before the Portland Thorns kicked off their home match against Houston Dash the club announced general manager Gavin Wilkinson had been placed on administrative leave. The Thorns had previously apologised for not being more transparent after receiving a complaint against then-coach Riley in 2015. As the Thorns and Dash linked arms inside Providence Park, a fan was seen holding a sign reading: “Six years.” Wednesday’s game between Spirit and Gotham, which ended 0-0, was supposed to have been an occasion to honour two-time World Cup winner Carli Lloyd, who is set to retire. “It’s been emotional week — we’ve had a lot to celebrate, a lot to reflect on,” the NJ/NY forward said after the game. Courage beat Louisville 3-1 in North Carolina.
