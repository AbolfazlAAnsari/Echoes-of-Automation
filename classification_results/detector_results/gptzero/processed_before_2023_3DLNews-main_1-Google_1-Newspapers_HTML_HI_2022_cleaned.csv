Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:12 am Naval ROTC midshipmen watch the air raids on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 first person from the deck of the USS Utah using virtual reality at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa, Feb. 22, 2022. The VR headsets were provided by the Pacific History Parks. Imagine standing on the deck of the USS Utah as Japanese aircraft fly above you, dropping bombs on the Navy ships around you. You can see the destruction and hear the cries of fellow Sailors. The date? Dec. 7, 1941. This is exactly what 25 Naval ROTC midshipmen at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa experienced Tuesday during their morning Naval Science 102 class. The midshipmen watched the air raid on Pearl Harbor from the point-of-view of a battleship deck and sat in the cockpit of a Japanese fighter plane, from take-off to the attack, through the lens of virtual reality headsets courtesy of Pacific Historic Parks, a non-profit organization that does historic preservation of historical sites in the Pacific. “I thought the VR headsets were a very new and different way of learning about the attacks of Pearl Harbor,” NROTC midshipman 4th Class Dylan Yamaguchi, a freshman kinesiology major, said. “Instead of imagining it in our heads, we’re actually able to see it firsthand and see all the little details that some history books don’t even point out.” Unlike established ROTC programs that have upperclassmen to help mentor lower classmen, the current midshipmen are forging their own way ahead. U.S. Navy Lt. Sawyer Smith, Department of Naval Science Naval ROTC aviation officer and instructor, teaches midshipmen about those killed in the attacks on Pearl Harbor and 9/11 in preparation for a virtual reality experience at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa, Feb. 22, 2022. In total, there are 25 midshipmen who are part of the 1st-ever NROTC program in Hawai’i. “They’re learning all of this firehose effect,” U.S. Navy Lt. Sawyer Smith, Department of Naval Science NROTC aviation officer and instructor, said. “They’re all doing an excellent job, and in my opinion, in the staff’s opinion, exceeding our expectations academically, physically, and really, in all aspects.” The class marked many firsts. Not only was this the first time PHP provided the experience in a university classroom setting, but they also presented it to midshipmen in the first-ever NROTC program on Hawai’i. “The Army and the Air Force have been here for quite some time, but this is the first year that the navy has been at the University of Hawai’i, in the state of Hawai’i, period,” Smith said. The Navy ROTC program educates and trains midshipmen for service as commissioned officers in the U.S. Navy or U.S. Marine Corps. Upon graduation, they will commission into the Reserves or active duty and must complete a required minimum service requirement. UH Mānoa NROTC requires the midshipmen to take Navy-centered classes that focus on navigation, leadership and more. The class Smith teaches was learning about the leadership styles during Pearl Harbor and provided a good opportunity to integrate VR. “We discuss a lot of leadership roles and decisions that were made in history in the Navy and the Marine Corps,” Smith explained. “They can learn from that, and they can use that when they are leading their own Sailors and Marines to make the best decision they know how at the time and hopefully not repeat history in a negative way … use what they’ve learned to change the course of the future for the better.” For NROTC Midshipman 4th Class Kirsten Spillman, the VR experience helped push that idea.

(Image from NTSB preliminary report/Special to West Hawaii Today) A tour helicopter experienced a “violent upset” followed by an uncontrolled spin before crashing June 8 in a Ka‘u lava field injuring all six people aboard. The crash, reported at 5:26 p.m., involved a Bell 407 four-blade, single-engine helicopter operated by Paradise Helicopters that had taken off at 5:01 p.m. from the Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport at Keahole, according to a preliminary report on the aviation accident released Wednesday the National Transportation Safety Board. According to the report, the helicopter was headed south and traveling about 140 mph to 146 mph at 500 feet to 600 feet after taking off. “The pilot reported that the first part of the flight was normal; about 30 minutes into the flight, the helicopter experienced a violent upset, followed by an uncontrolled spin (yaw) to the right,” the NTSB preliminary report reads. A female passenger, seated toward the back of the helicopter, reported that as the helicopter continued to spin, she saw something fall from the aircraft. “However, she was not able to identify a specific part,” the report reads. After the helicopter crashed into an area of rough, uneven, lava-covered terrain, it came to a rest on its left side. At that point, a passenger called to report the helicopter had crashed, according to the NTSB. Emergency responders utilized both county helicopters to extricate the six injured persons from the remote crash site in a lava field between the Hawaiian Ranchos subdivision and South Point Road. Three suffered serious injuries while the other three reported minor injuries. All six were taken to Kona Community Hospital for care; two were later flown to Oahu for further treatment while the others were released. According to the preliminary NTSB report released Wednesday, an examination of the site of the crash found the helicopter’s tail boom came to a rest about 762 feet northeast of the fuselage, engine and main rotor system. “The tail boom separated from the fuselage at the tail boom attach point,” the report reads. “The upper left attachment fitting fastener was not present, and the lower left attachment fitting was fractured and displayed fatigue signatures. The fasteners for the lower left, lower right, and upper right attachment fittings were present.” The tail boom attachment fasteners were last checked on May 4, according to the report that noted the tail boom was installed in 2009, and hadn’t been removed between then and the crash. The crash occurred about 114 flight hours after the May 4 torque check. Portions of the tail boom structure, aft fuselage structure, attachment fittings and fasteners were retained for further examination by the NTSB’s Materials Laboratory According to the preliminary report, west-southwest winds of 10 mph were reported at the time of the crash. Visibility was estimated at 10 miles though conditions were overcast with a few clouds present over 4,900 feet at the time of the crash. “K&S Helicopters is working closely with the pilot, NTSB, FAA, and Bell, to support a thorough investigation of the June 8 accident on the Island of Hawaii. All Bell 407 aircraft operated by K&S Helicopters have been voluntarily grounded out of an abundance of caution until further safety determinations can be made,” Calvin Dorn, chairman of Paradise Helicopters and CEO of its parent company, K&S Helicopters Inc., said in a prepared statement. “The company is in the process of reviewing the preliminary NTSB findings, and we will continue to work with investigators as they complete a final report.” Hawaii has a thriving helicopter tour sector because of the flights that are extremely popular among tourists who want to see the islands’ stunning scenery from the aircraft that fly above rugged terrain that’s hard to reach otherwise. According to an NTSB database, the Paradise Helicopters was involved in at least two previous accidents during sightseeing tours. While returning from a sightseeing tour in 2005, a helicopter developed a “sudden vibration in the tail rotor pedals” followed by a loud crack or snap and then a loud banging noise, the NTSB said. It hit low trees and shrubs when the pilot landed in a clearing in a forest near the Big Island town of Pahoa. The pilot and four passengers were uninjured. And as a Paradise helicopter pilot prepared to take off in 2009 for a sightseeing tour of Oahu for four passengers, the helicopter’s left landing gear collapsed, NTSB records said. The helicopter tilted to the left and was damaged, but no one aboard was injured. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Share this story""}]"

She said that the purpose of the project is to minimize the negative impacts of feral animals in the park by building a fence for both parks and developing a management plan over the next four to six months that addresses control methods specific to the needs in the area. Collaborations between federal, state and county officials to build fencing have proven successful, she noted, including at Kahului Airport earlier this year. “I recently ran into (Maui District Airports Manager) Marvin Moniz and he said, and I was surprised, but he said that they are continuing to try and control axis deer around the airport and they were able to control 500 of them,” Sugimura said. “I wanted to thank Marvin Moniz and that group that are continuing to try and control and mitigate the axis deer problem around the airport because as you can guess, if there were any disruptions with the airlines, that would be a big accident waiting to happen. “This just emphasizes the need to get control over the axis deer problems.” * Dakota Grossman can be reached at dgrossman@mauinews.com.

Evangelista, Assistant Editor and Gilbert S.C. Keith-Agaran, Contributing Writer Almost every Filipino family has someone working as a nurse or studying to be a nurse or knows a Filipino nurse. Nursing remains as much a calling as a profession. The American Nurses Association theme this year for National Nurses Week is “Nurses Make a Difference” while our neighbors up north, the Canadian Nurses Association are using “We Answer The Call.” Both themes capture the key role nurses play in our health care system, something illustrated daily during this pandemic. National Nurses Week is now an entire month. Traditionally, it ran from May 6 through May 12, ending on the birthdate of Florence Nightingale, the “Founder of Modern Nursing.” Maui is fortunate to have an active chapter of the 43-year-old Philippine Nurses Association of America, Inc. (PNAA), whose President’s message this month is “You Make a Difference.” Organized and installed in May 2019–several months before the pandemic outbreak—the mission of the Philippine Nurses Association Maui Hawaii (PNAMHi) is to “uplift the positive image of the Filipino as a nurse; uphold the social welfare of its constituent members; promote and support professional excellence through education and community involvement; and contribute to significant outcomes for healthcare and society,” according to Christina “Lucy” Porte, the inaugural president of PNAMHi. The Maui Chapter became one of 55 chapters of the PNAA, which represents over 5,000 members nationwide. On May 29, Angelina “Angie” Saiki will be installed as PNAMHi’s next president at a Gala Night dinner at the Maui Beach Hotel, along with the rest of the PNAMHi Board of Directors: Jeny Bissell, President-elect; Monica Natividad, Vice President; Veronica Sagun, Secretary; Aileen Concepcion, Assistant Secretary; Jeanylyn Onnagan, Treasurer; Mary Jane Asayo-Paet, Assistant Treasurer; Christina “Lucy” Porte, Auditor; and Directors Erwyn Bala, Rowena “Nikki” Baysa, Christine Gumpal, Rose Tumacder and Mary Jean Guira. In just three years PNAMHi made significant contributions to Maui, including participating in the American Cancer Society Relay for Life; Maui Fil-Am Heritage Festival Health Fair; Christ the King Church Health and Wellness program; Christ the King Church Annual Bazaar First Aid Station; the Good Shepherd Episcopal Church Ka ‘Ohana Kitchen and Binhi at Ani’s Bayanihan Feeding Program. PNAMHi also supported Binhi at Ani’s monthly Bayanihan Food Distribution from its inception in May 2020. PNAMHi also played a significant role with testing and vaccination clinics at Wailea Pharmacy, Paw, Mauliola Pharmacy, Department of Health, St. Theresa Roman Catholic Church, University of Hawai‘i Maui College and Binhi at Ani Filipino Community Center. PNAMHi was also in the trenches fighting COVID-19 misinformation in the Filipino community. “The members of PNAMHi have been instrumental in our Health & Wellness Program,” said Melen Agcolicol, president of Binhi at Ani. “Our Bayanihan Food Distribution, our Bayanihan Feeding Program and our Bakuna at Binhi at Ani Filipino Community Center needed support from the nurses and they have consistently supported Binhi, along with many other volunteers from our community.” “I can’t change the world but I can make a difference in someone’s life,” explains Marceliza “Marcie” Luwalhati, a member of PNAMHi. Public Health nurse Jeny Bissell, who has been a nurse for thirty-four years, looks back at her career and says “It’s been a great journey, I met wonderful people in their darkest and brightest moments. I want to think I made a difference in someone’s life and I left them in a much better place.” Bissell admits nursing was not her first career choice. “I wanted to be an accountant but I had a change of heart in college after a boring and uninspiring economics professor,” she explains. Similarly, Luwalhati wanted to be a psychologist but her family did not have the financial means to support her. Other members (Sofia Cabias, Dione Cabias, Angelina Saiki) say it was the white uniform and cap that attracted them. Today, the uniform is more practical—scrubs in multiple colors. (Even the nursing students at UH Maui College have different color scrubs for each year: teal for the first-year students and burgundy for the second-year students.) Sofia Cabias and other nurses came to the United States to seek a better life. The 1965 Immigration act opened the doors for family reunification and professionals like nurses to immigrate to the United States. Nurses educated and trained in foreign countries such as the Philippines, however, still had to pass a written exam to practice. By the mid-1980s, Hawai‘i was experiencing a severe nursing shortage and statistics predicted Hawai‘i’s aging population would continue to rapidly increase. Then State Representative Romy Cachola introduced House Bill 2330 in 1988 wherein the Legislature determined [T]here is a need for a program which would immediately increase the number of licensed nurses in the State. There are many graduate nurses in Hawaii working as licensed practical nurses, nurses aids, ward clerks, doctor’s secretaries, and other similar nursing related work, who have not yet passed the written examination required for the commission on graduates of foreign nursing schools, or the written examination required by the state board of nursing, or both. The time demands of their occupation and other socioeconomic pressures prevent them from otherwise being able to prepare adequately for the licensing examinations. With some concerted assistance from the private sector and the State, these graduate nurses may be able to pass the written examination and become licensed nurses. HB 2330 was signed into law by then Governor John Waihe‘e as Act 212, establishing a two-year pilot program called “Operation Nightingale” to design a review and training course to enable graduates of nursing schools to pass the required written examination. Operation Nightingale was later extended for another two years. Bissell estimates about 75 percent of the Maui chapter members received training in the Philippines. The pandemic exposed the continuing need for more nurses. Although UH Maui College offers a two-year Associate Science degree (ASN) which attracts approximately150 applicants, UH Maui College can only accept about 40 students due to the lack of faculty and the current budget. A significant number of the applicants and students are of Filipino ancestry. “The nursing students at UH Maui College are doing well despite COVID,” said Assistant Professor Feliciana “Fely” Domingo Sales. “With COVID, we changed a lot of the teaching methods and many of our clinical partners closed their doors. We did a lot of simulation and initially we were worried at the lack of hands-on-clinicals but we were happy with the results of the high passing rates of the NCLEX exam.” Sales, who was born in Hawai‘i, received her Bachelor of Science from Northwestern College in the Philippines and has been teaching at the UH Maui College Nursing school for over fifteen years, where she is the only faculty member of Filipino ancestry. Sales’ story is typical of the obstacles faced by foreign educated nurses. When she returned to Hawai‘i in 1996, she could not practice right away and had to start as a nurse aid while successfully proving her BSN from the Philippines was equivalent to a BSN in the United States. Sales initially took the LPN exam and passed and then took the RN exam and passed. She worked at Hale Makua for nine years and became the Charge Nurse. While working at Hale Makua, Sales received her Masters from the University of Phoenix. Like Sales, many other nurses continued their education while working full-time. Monica Elaydo Natividad, the first Registered Nurse First Assistant of Filipino ancestry at Maui Memorial Hospital, achieved her BSN at Chamberlain University while working full-time. Sannah Kelly Evangelista, who started at Hale Makua, transferred to Maui Memorial Hostpital and is now at Kaiser, recently completed her BSN through online courses at Colorado Technical University. Both Natividad and Evangelista are beneficiaries of the Ben Hudnall Memorial Trust. The sheer determination of Sales and other nurses to excel, achieve and improve themselves despite the challenges are classic American dream stories. And they have not gone unrecognized, especially by the doctors. “Each year during the week of May 6–12, we recognize the incredible individuals who work in the nursing profession for National Nurses Week. This year is even more remarkable as we emerge out of the devastating COVID pandemic,” said Dr. Errol Buntuyan, the Physician in Charge of Kaiser Maui’s Primary Care. “Nurses have endured an overwhelming amount of risk, work and sacrifice to care for our island community.

Gerpe calls his program “Makrokosmos50” (learn more at www.makrokosmos50.com). Admission is free. Seating is limited, so it’s advisable to arrive early. There will be a pre-concert discussion at 6:30 p.m. For further information, contact ProArts Playhouse (proartsmaui.com) at (808) 463-6550, or e-mail ebbandflowarts2013@gmail.com or call (808) 876-1854. The theater is located at 1280 South Kihei Road. L.A. Times Music Critic Mark Sweddes described his playing as “wonderfully illuminating… his tone is crystalline. His technique is dazzlingly fluid.” “Makrokosmos, Volume 1” is a masterwork that not only utilizes the full dynamic and expressive range of the piano played from the keyboard. Crumb masterfully creates an entirely new coloristic and tonal palette by making use of extended, inside-the-piano techniques. In addition, the pianist must chant, shout, sing, whistle and moan like a ghost. There are 12 movements in this piece, which Crumb subtitles “Twelve Fantasy Pieces after the Zodiac.” To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the composition of “Makrokosmos, Volume I,” pianist/composer Gerpe commissioned 12 composers — Vera Ivanova, Fernanda Aoki Navarro, Gernot Wolfgang, Eric Guinivan, Alexander Elliott Miller, Viet Cuong, Julie Herndon, Gilda Lyons, Timothy Peterson, Juhi Bansal, Thomas Osborne and Gerpe himself — to each write a response to one movement of Crumb’s original masterwork. Gerpe will record and release both works as an album in 2022. Gerpe will also perform this free concert on Sunday, Aug. 28, at 4 p.m. at Orvis Auditorium on the campus of the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honolulu. This event is part of E&FA’s annual, multi-day, multi-site, international NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST FESTIVAL 2022.

Yet the quest for that money is in limbo, the latest victim of election-year gridlock that’s stalled or killed a host of Democratic priorities. WASHINGTON — The U.S. is headed for “a lot of unnecessary loss of life,” the Biden administration says, if Congress fails to provide billions more dollars to brace for the pandemic’s next wave. Yet the quest for that money is in limbo, the latest victim of election-year gridlock that’s stalled or killed a host of Democratic priorities. President Joe Biden’s appeal for funds for vaccines, testing and treatments has hit opposition from Republicans, who’ve fused the fight with the precarious politics of immigration. Congress is in recess, and the next steps are uncertain, despite admonitions from White House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha of damaging consequences from “every day we wait.” Administration officials say they’re running low on money to stock up on, or even begin to order, the latest vaccines, tests and treatments. Also lacking are funds to reimburse doctors treating uninsured patients and to help poor countries control the pandemic. House and Senate Democrats have been wrangling over how to resolve the stalemate and even over which chamber should vote first. It’s an open question whether they’ll ever get the GOP votes they’ll need to pull the legislation through the 50-50 Senate, and prospects in the narrowly divided House are unclear as well. “There is still an urgency to pass a COVID relief package,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said last week. “It’s very, very much needed.” Optimists hope the measure could start rolling once Congress returns next week. Pessimists say without quick resolution, Democrats may not have enough leverage to push the money to passage until early fall. That’s when they could stuff it into legislation that will probably be needed to finance government — a bill that would avert a federal shutdown, a pre-election distraction Republicans will be desperate to avoid. The heap of sidelined Democratic initiatives has grown this year, a victim of GOP opposition and rebellions by centrists like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. Casualties include bills on voting rights, health care, environment, taxes, gun curbs, abortion rights, policing tactics and an investigation of the 2021 Capitol storming by then-President Donald Trump’s supporters. While lawmakers have approved massive packages financing federal agencies through September and helping Ukraine counter Russia’s invasion, other priorities are dead or drifting, even as Democrats’ days running Congress are likely dwindling. Republicans are favored to win House control in November’s elections and could grab the Senate as well, and Democrats’ frustration is clear. “So far it hasn’t moved,” Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said of Biden’s latest $22.5 billion request for COVID-19, which he initially sent Congress three months ago. “But then neither has sensible gun legislation, neither has voting rights.” “The 50-50 Senate sucks,” she said. The COVID money is needed quickly, officials say. Their warnings have come with over 1 million U.S. deaths from the disease and a fresh variant that daily is hospitalizing over 100,000 Americans and killing more than 300. Both numbers are rising. Officials say that lacking fresh funds, the U.S. is falling behind other countries that are already lining up for supplies needed for fall and winter. That’s prompted Jha to plan for the chance that Congress provides no new money at all, threatening painful choices about what to do if there aren’t enough vaccines or therapeutics for all who need them. “It would be terrible,” Jha told reporters recently. “I think we would see a lot of unnecessary loss of life if that were to happen.” Congress has provided $370 billion for purchasing supplies, for research and other public health initiatives to combat the pandemic, according to administration tallies obtained by The Associated Press. Around $14 billion of it was unspent or not committed to contracts as of April 5, the documents show, serious money but an amount the administration says falls below the ultimate need.

how quickly the year has flown by. Yet again, these cliches ring true. And 2022 really was a year when much started to look different here in our islands: Covid-19 regulations eased, voters chose a new governor and representatives at all levels of government, tourism bounced back and a volcano erupted. All in all, Civil Beat published more than 2,000 articles and columns. Our local operation reached well over 5 million people across the globe thanks to the support of more than 7,500 readers like you. And because of your generosity, our little newsroom is not so little anymore. Civil Beat has seen tremendous growth since it was founded in 2010, and 2022 was no exception. We rolled out a neighbor island reporting team, published four major investigative projects and launched our pop-up newsroom initiative to get out in communities — particularly those we don’t spend as much time in — to hear what you think we should be writing about. We’re really proud of the impactful stories our team told over the past year. So would you care to join me in taking a month-by-month look at 12 of our biggest articles of 2022? Federal prosecutors charged three former high-level Honolulu officials — former corporation counsel Donna Leong, former Honolulu Police Commission chair Max Sword and former managing director Roy Amemiya — with conspiracy for allegedly misusing city money to give a $250,000 payout to now-disgraced police chief Louis Kealoha. Read the full story. Another month, another public corruption investigation. Former Hawaii Senate Majority Leader J. Kalani English and former state Rep. Ty Cullen were charged with taking bribes to influence legislation and later pleaded guilty. Cullen — who accepted $23,000 and gifts such as casino chips — has yet to be sentenced but English — who received $15,000 and gifts such as Las Vegas hotel rooms — was sentenced to three years behind bars. Read the full story. We grew used to seeing small fragments of our neighbors’ faces for the first two years of pandemic, but that started to change when Hawaii became the last state to drop its indoor mask mandate on March 25. Then-Gov. David Ige simultaneously dropped the Safe Travels program, which required travelers to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test upon arrival. Read the full story. As Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi sought to revitalize Chinatown — a neighborhood long affected by homelessness and mental illness — the River of Life Mission served its last meal there in April after 35 years and agreed to move its feeding center. Meanwhile, three other Oahu homeless service providers prepared to leave their spaces by the year’s end. Read the full story. Lawmakers made good on a lot of promises this year thanks in part to a $2 billion budget surplus. They set aside more than $1 billion to benefit Hawaiians — including $600 million for Hawaiian Home Lands — put $300 million toward affordable housing projects and paved the way to raise the minimum wage to $18 in 2028, all the while stashing away $500 million for a rainy day. Read the full story. The Aloha State became the first in the nation the legalize abortions in 1970, and politicians doubled down on their commitment to abortion rights following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. As some wondered whether more women might travel to the islands to receive an abortion, then-Gov. David Ige said he “will do everything in my power to ensure that women retain control over their own reproductive choices” in Hawaii — one of 16 states with laws protecting abortion access. Read the full story. In July, we exclusively published video footage of the November 2021 fuel leak at the Red Hill facility that ultimately sickened hundreds and contaminated the drinking water supply. The worker who accidentally triggered the leak recorded through the window of a ventilation door as fuel shot out of a broken PVC pipe and created a churning flood of fuel on the floor. Watch the video and read the full story. In August, as part of our Journey to Care series we reported that people from Indigenous Pacific communities here and across the nation are less likely to get kidney transplants, though Pacific Islanders are disproportionately affected by kidney disease. Pacific Islanders suffer from kidney failure at a rate four times higher than their rate of getting kidney transplants, while the number of kidney transplants for white patients was 20% higher than would be expected from their kidney failure rate. Read the full story. In September we published a major story as part of our investigative series, Hawaii v. Parental Rights, and reported that eight in 10 children who are removed from their homes by state workers were taken without a court order.

Bright lights can disorient wildlife, causing birds to fall to the ground and turtles to travel inland. Read the full story. In November we launched one of our biggest projects in the year — UXO: Lethal Legacy. Our first piece in the series dug into how more than 20 people are thought to be killed by dormant World War II-era explosives left behind in the Solomon Islands by the U.S. and Japan. Their stories are harrowing, yet the Solomon Islands have received little help to deal with this problem. Read the full story. For the first time in eight years, Hawaii awoke to a new governor at the state’s helm in December. Gov.

Emergency crews searched the waters off Keawakapu after a snorkeler reportedly went missing following a shark sighting. The Maui News / MATTHEW THAYER photos A snorkeler reportedly tried to fight off a shark and swam to shore where he reported his wife missing, setting off an hourslong search by aircraft, Jet Skis and divers in the waters off Keawakapu Beach on Thursday afternoon. “It’s very much a fluid situation,” Dan Dennison, spokesperson for the state Department of Land and Natural Resources, said during a news conference on Thursday afternoon. “We’re all obviously hoping for a good outcome. The search has been going for almost five hours now. So they’ll continue in earnest until … another hour, hour and a half or so, and then as I said, they’ll reassess where we go from there.” Dennison said that just before noon on Thursday, a man called 911 to report that he’d seen a shark swim by repeatedly while he was snorkeling about 50 yards off Keawakapu. The man returned to shore after looking for his wife, Dennison said. The Maui Fire Department and Ocean Safety personnel conducted an “extensive” search with Jet Skis, divers and a rescue boat, while the department’s Air One helicopter and U.S. Coast Guard aircraft assisted from above. The Coast Guard deployed a C-130 and MH-65 Dolphin helicopter from Air Station Barbers Point, as well as a 45-foot response boat from the Maui station, Coast Guard public affairs specialist Ryan Fisher said Thursday evening. State DLNR officer Matt Pauole fields questions about Thursday afternoon’s beach closure at Keawakapu. Fisher said the Coast Guard received a report that the husband and wife were snorkeling when the husband saw a shark and tried to fight it off. He quickly swam to shore and called 911 when he didn’t see his wife. Fisher said the Coast Guard did not have additional information about what may have happened to the wife, but that she was last seen wearing a blue bathing suit. Typically in shark incidents, authorities don’t release information until all the facts are known. “However, in this case, an ongoing search for a person who possibly encountered a shark earlier today caused us to set aside the normal operating procedure,” Dennison said. Dennison said authorities are characterizing the event as “a possible shark-human encounter,” but that they could not provide any details about the possible victims, their ages, genders or hometowns. The missing person was last seen just before noon, Dennison said. He said no one had seen the shark since it was first reported and did not have information about the shark’s size. When asked if emergency responders may expand or shift the search based on where the currents might take a person, Dennison said, “I haven’t heard anything about that.” “All we know is they’re going to continue the search until nightfall and then I think they’ll reassess at that point in time and see what they may do tomorrow,” he said. Shark warning signs have been posted from Mana Kai condos to the north end of Wailea Beach and will remain in place until at least noon today after the all-clear has been issued, according to officials. Fall and early winter tend to be the most common times for shark and human encounters in Hawaii, with most incidents from 1980 to 2021 occurring in October and November, according to DLNR records. Maui tends to see the most shark incidents (61 since 1995, the most of any other island), though the island had accounted for only one of the six incidents in the state so far this year. Hawaii island has seen the most incidents with three; Oahu and Kauai have seen one apiece. The other shark incident on Maui this year involved a snorkeler who lost an arm and suffered puncture wounds to the torso in turbid waters at Paia Bay. Dennison reminded beachgoers not to enter the water if it’s murky and to not go in after dark or before sunrise. Always swim, snorkel or do other types of recreation in the ocean with a companion, he added. * Colleen Uechi can be reached at cuechi@mauinews.com.
