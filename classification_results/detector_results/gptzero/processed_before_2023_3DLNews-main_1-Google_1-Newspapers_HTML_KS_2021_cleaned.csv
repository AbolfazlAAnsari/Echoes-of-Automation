A proposed House Concurrent Resolution will urge the U.S. Congress to extend daylight saving time nationwide, according to legislation. The House Federal and State Affairs committee initially examined the legislation in a hearing Feb. 11. The resolution would seek to end the annual time change in the spring and implement daylight saving time year-round. The resolution states the benefits of this change are more daylight, more playtime outside for children, crime reduction and more economic opportunity. Rep. Shannon Francis, a Republican from Liberal, became intrigued by this topic after seeing a Facebook post from a fellow member of the Legislature. Francis then made his own Facebook poll for his constituents, where the results led him to create this resolution. “I had 108 responses on my survey, and 60% of those responses wanted daylight saving time year-round, and another 14% wanted standard time year-round,” Francis said. “Another 20% of my constituents said they don’t care either way; they just want to stop changing the clocks.” This debate is not just happening in Kansas. Scott Yates, founder of #LockTheClock, said 15 other states have adopted resolutions in support of year-round daylight saving time. Yates said safety for children and pollution is a big factor behind the support of year-round daylight saving. “For children coming home from school, having more daylight at those times would drastically reduce accidents involving children,” Yates said. “Also, with afternoon rush hour pollution happening while there is still sun, it burns off most of the dangerous ozone.” Although no one opposed ending the switch, support for this resolution wasn’t unanimous. Jay Pea, founder of Save Standard Time, wants to amend the resolution to make standard time the official time. Pea warned that year-round daylight saving time was adopted in the United States during both World Wars. The policy was repealed as soon as the wars ended. Pea also said that adopting daylight saving time during the winter months would lead to a 9 a.m. sunrise. For more than a third of the year, people would be starting school and work in darkness. Pea said adopting permanent daylight saving time would be very dangerous. “Permanent daylight saving time reduces sleep, it reduces immunity, it increases sickness and it increases accidents,” Pea said. “It is not just the clock change that harms. Clocks are not arbitrary. When we do things matters.” The resolution was pushed to be discussed in depth at a later date.

In the past year, the University of Kansas has grappled with the loss of a number of faculty members leaving to join other universities, an exodus some say is the result of KU’s inadequate measures for retaining underrepresented faculty and students. When the University of Kansas downsized its office dedicated to diversity, equity and inclusion and placed it under the guise of Provost Barbara Bichelmeyer, KU’s constituents questioned its dedication to recruiting and retaining faculty and students of color. While faculty, staff and students have probed KU on its faculty retention, Bichelmeyer has acknowledged the issue and is trying to clean up the situation, she said. About 29% of KU’s 8,356 faculty and staff are not white — 956 are international, 495 are Asian, 495 are Hispanic, 315 are Black or African American and 51 are American Indian or Alaska native, according to KU’s Analytics, Institutional Research and Effectiveness data from fall 2021.

KU did not disclose the reasons for the firings and continue to deny disclosure, citing personnel matters. In February, Bichelmeyer announced that each department or school must have its own strategic diversity plan in addition to KU’s plan. In an interview with the Kansan, Bichelmeyer said she expects plans from each school by the end of the academic year. KU’s framework for diversity and equity will be shared with a steering committee and advisory council by the end of the calendar year and implementation will begin shortly thereafter, she said.

More: Topekan Jeffrey James Exon charged with murder in death of 2-year-old daughter Aurora Exon Shawnee County District attorney Mike Kagay announced March 31 that Exon, 45, had been charged with three crimes linked to the death of his daughter, Aurora Exon. Those were first-degree felony murder, aggravated child endangerment and failure to report the death of a child. Kansas law defines first-degree felony murder as homicide resulting from the commission, attempt to commit or escape from an inherently dangerous felony. Exon\'s preliminary hearing has been set for June 17. He was being held Saturday morning in the Shawnee County Jail on a $1 million bond, according to jail records. The affidavit said Exon\'s voice was calm Jan. 5 as he told a dispatcher that his daughter had no pulse. More: Police investigate shooting of man in East Topeka; wounds not considered life-threatening Exon added that his daughter\'s eyes were white and her fingernails and toenails were blue, that document said. The toddler\'s older brother was away at school at the time, according to the affidavit. It said Exon told the dispatcher he had sole custody of both children, and that his son was fine. But the affidavit said Exon acknowledged his daughter had been weak the day before he found her dead, and that he should have taken her to a hospital emergency room. Kagay said Topeka police responded about 10 a.m. Jan. 5 to investigate an unresponsive child at 3501 S.W. 10th Ave. Police and first responders arriving at the scene found Aurora Exon, who appeared to have been dead for several days, Kagay said. He said the alleged crimes were committed between Dec. 26, 2020 — the day Aurora Exon was last seen alive — and Jan. 5. Aurora was born May 21, 2018, according to her obituary. It said that in addition to her father, her survivors included her mother, Seonaid Nichols of St. Marys; a brother, Teddy Exon of the home; and a half-brother, Eli Swendsen, of Topeka. ""Aurora loved cuddling with her daddy, and playing with her brother and friends,"" the obituary said. ""She loved to dance and had a smile that would light up a room and the hearts of those around her. She also loved cheese and peanut butter crackers."" The affidavit quoted Exon as saying he loved his son but favored his daughter. ""Jeffrey said that his daughter was the love of his life,"" it said. According to the affidavit: ""Jeffrey said that the kids last saw their mother right after Christmas. Jeffrey said that she brought the kids home early. Jeffrey does not know where they went but thinks they went back to St. Marys."" Exon said his daughter last saw her pediatrician on Dec. 8, according to the affidavit. It said Exon indicated his daughter had been ""fine"" on Jan. 2. But the affidavit quoted Exon as saying that his daughter — who usually sprang to life in the morning, saying ""Daddy Daddy Daddy"" — was clearly becoming weaker when he brought her cheese, crackers and water the morning of Jan. 3. ""Jeffrey said she did not eat the crackers and barely touched the water,"" it said. The affidavit quoted Exon as saying that on the morning of Jan. 4 he brought his daughter more cheese and crackers, which, to his knowledge, were ""still sitting on the table."" The affidavit added: ""He said that she was weak yesterday, January 4, 2021, and he should have taken her to the emergency room. Jeffrey said that they had Christmas celebration at his house that night with his brother. Jeffrey said that she did not eat much at Christmas dinner.""'}]"

Lawrence City Commission in Tuesday\'s election. Polls close at 7 p.m. Voters can find their polling place here. Milton Scott, the former Assistant Director of Admissions and former Assistant Director of Student Housing at the University of Kansas, is running for Lawrence City Commission. Scott said he is the only city commissioner candidate who has had experience in providing affordable housing. He spent over 20 years with the Lawrence-Douglas County Housing Authority as Director of Programs and Property Management. Moreover, he worked as Assistant Director for KU Student Housing. “What matters most is that aspect of it is that I will be able to bring to the community that will get us across the field a lot sooner and a lot quicker,” Scott said. Some issues can create a domino effect if not addressed in time, Scott said. Using his experience, he plans to visualize those negative effects and eliminate them before the situation exacerbates. He has administered and written grants for federal programs, including Moving to Work (MTW), Transitional Housing, public housing and Section 8. Scott oversaw the HOPE House program that housed chronically homeless individuals with dual diagnosis of mental illness and substance abuse, according to Scott’s campaign website. Scott supports the review of current utility rates, according to his campaign website. “I have seen how utility rates affect those families,” Scott said. “Generally, if they’re behind on rent, they’re behind on utilities as well.” Scott aims to limit repurposing. Repurposing is redirecting funds towards a different area that somewhat relates to the money’s original purpose. “If we’re saying we want to solve a problem, let’s solve it,” he said. “Let’s use those funds for that.” Scott spoke about how money for housing was repurposed into money for staff and police as one example of why he is opposed to repurposing money. “We just got millions of dollars for developing affordable housing, but we put it into staff,"" Scott said. ""We also put it in some areas for the police. It takes away from those original intents, and then it causes a domino effect.” Another point Scott focused on was recycling and how it can have a long-term impact on the environment. “Recycling downtown is not even a comprehensive recycling program,” he said. “It has been reported that some businesses have to take their recycling home to put in their recycling.” The City Commission should help the community to be more visionary, Scott said. “I think just having individuals that can look at these things and bring the community together and say: This is what we\'re doing, this is what we’re expecting down the road, and this is how we can enhance it to make it an even better place to live and raise a family,” he said.

When most people think of beauty pageants, the first image that comes to mind is of girls on stage all dolled up in gowns, but people often overlook the commitment and preparation behind the curtains. Wichita’s Ava Johnson, Dominique Fonseca, Mykaysia Maples, and Khavayi Tsimonjela trained extensively for this year’s Kansas National American Miss (NAM) pageant and exceeded their expectations. All four girls finished in the Top 10 in their respective age groups at the Kansas NAM pageant held July 9 in Branson, MO. Johnson,7, nearly swept the Jr. PreTeen division with a 2nd runner-up finish and awards for spokesmodel and casual wear. Fonseca,11, was the Kansas PreTeen winner and also won spokesmodel. Both girls automatically earned the opportunity to participate in the NAM finals pageant Thanksgiving week at the Hyatt Regency in Orlando, FL. Maples, 17, was 2rd runner-up in the Teen division’s spokesmodel category and Tsimonjelo,13, was 1st runner-up in the same category for PreTeens. Other than Tsimonjela, this was all of the girls’ first time in a beauty pageant. The girls, in part, contribute their success to coaches Denise Colborn and Anessa Relf. Colborn is the mother of former Miss Teen USA winner Hailey Colborn, and Relf is passionate about helping black girls build self-confidence. Thanks to this duo, the girls arrived at the pageant well prepared and knew exactly what to expect on pageant day. “Our coaching style is that we always believe that kids should be kids. It’s our goal as coaches, just to make sure that we give our girls a real shot at winning those rounds and making sure that they’re prepared, but staying true to who they are and having fun,” said Colborn. Colborn and Relf want to get Black representation at beauty pageants and show other young Black girls that there is a lot to benefit from participating, such as public speaker and characters skills that will carry them into adulthood. The National American Miss is a pageant for girls ranging in age from four to twenty, with five age categories (at the state level) and six (at the national level). The organization promotes itself as less of a “beauty pageant” and more of a method to assist girls in developing confidence and better communication skills.
