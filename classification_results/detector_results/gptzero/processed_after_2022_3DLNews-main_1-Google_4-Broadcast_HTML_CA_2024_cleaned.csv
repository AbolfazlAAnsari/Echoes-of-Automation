(Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for Disney) LOS ANGELES - Backed by X owner Elon Musk, actress Gina Carano is suing Lucasfilm and its parent The Walt Disney Co. over her 2021 firing from ""The Mandalorian,"" saying she was let go from the series for expressing right-wing views online. The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday with the help of X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, in California federal court, according to the Associated Press. Carano alleges in the complaint that she was wrongfully terminated from the ""Star Wars"" galaxy Disney+ streaming series after two seasons over a post likening the treatment of American conservatives to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. She is seeking damages to be determined at trial and a court order that she be recast on the show. The ""Mandalorian,"" starring Pedro Pascal, is a bounty hunter tale that has aired for three seasons and is now being turned into a feature film. Several interconnected series also air on Disney+. Carano, a former mixed martial artist, played the recurring character Cara Dune. Elon Musk had some harsh words for advertisers who are fleeing the platform ""X"". ""Go f--- yourself,"" Musk said during an appearance at The New York Times DealBook Summit. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Carano’s post said: ""most people today don’t realize that to get to the point where Naxi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?"" Carano deleted the post, but it was widely shared online and spurred a trending #FireGinaCarano hashtag.

She was also accused of mocking the use of gender pronouns in profiles, listing ""beep/bop/boop"" in her social media bio. She said this was not about mocking trans people but a ""Star Wars"" reference to R2-D2, and the lawsuit calls it ""a playful way to defuse all the harassment she had received.""

Gavin Newsom on Tuesday announced plans to deploy 120 California Highway Patrol officers in and around Oakland as part of a “surge operation” to crack down on theft and violent crime in the city and surrounding area. “What’s happening in this beautiful city and surrounding area is alarming and unacceptable,” Newsom said in a statement, noting that as crime has dropped in many cities across the state — including San Francisco and Los Angeles — it has continued to climb in Oakland. “I’m sending the California Highway Patrol to assist local efforts to restore a sense of safety that the hardworking people of Oakland and the East Bay demand and deserve.” The deployment will mark a nearly 900% increase in CHP personnel in Oakland and Alameda County, according to the statement, and amounts to almost 20% of the total number of OPD officers. “Throughout the operation, the CHP’s efforts will include enforcement of auto theft, cargo theft, retail crime, and high-visibility proactive traffic enforcement in and around Oakland and Alameda County,” CHP spokesperson Jaime Coffee said. The strategy, he added, is to saturate the area with officers and investigators who will work directly with local law enforcement agencies. “This will include CHP specialty units like narcotics-detecting K9 units and air support,” Coffee said. “CHP will also deploy license-plate reader technology to detect and recover stolen vehicles.” Gov.

His theme was that the upcoming presidential election will determine whether or not America remains a democracy because a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to end democracy in America. Politically speaking, the purpose of the speech was clear. Given that Biden has among the lowest favorability numbers ever recorded for a sitting president, he cannot make the election about his achievements. Because he has none that warrant his reelection. In every way, he has made America a worse country. He has terribly damaged the economy — increased an already unsustainable national debt; changed an energy-independent and energy-exporting country into an energy dependent and energy-importing one. He hurt America and the world by withdrawing — and in the way he withdrew — American troops from Afghanistan. He showed that America cannot be counted on by those who depend on us. He abandoned $7 billion in weaponry, much of it now being used by Islamic terror groups. For example, as NBC News reported, “Most of the weapons recovered so far, officials say, are from Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) or Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), both Pakistan-based militant groups that the U.S. designates as terrorist organizations.” Other weapons have ended up in Gaza, and others in Iran. He has hurt America and Israel by enriching the Iranian regime. According to the Wall Street Journal, “The Iranian surge in oil exports since President Biden took over has brought Iran an additional $32 billion to $35 billion, according to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. … The cause of the Iranian windfall is clear: As part of Mr. Biden’s quiet diplomacy with Iran, the U.S. has curtailed sanctions enforcement. … Iran’s funding for Hamas ballooned in the past year to $350 million.” In addition, Biden paid Iran $6 billion to ransom five American hostages. Why didn’t Russia invade Ukraine while Trump was president? Probably because Putin feared Trump. What foreign leader fears Biden? The only people who fear Biden are half of the American people. He has done terrible damage to the most important freedom — freedom of speech. Among other things, his administration worked with Big Tech before and since the 2020 election to censor political speech. He has created the first large set of political prisoners in American history — hundreds, soon perhaps thousands, of Americans sentenced to prison for merely entering the Capitol, or for just being present on the Capitol grounds, on Jan. 6. He has weaponized the Department of Justice against his political opponents, and is overseeing the prosecution of an ex-president and political rival for the first time in American history. From his first day in office, he has stoked racial tension in America. His inaugural address was the most hate-filled and divisive inaugural address in American history. He has so demoralized the American military that recruitment levels are at their lowest ever. He has promoted biological boys competing against girls in high school and college sports under the guise of “transgender rights.” Therefore, his one route to victory is to convince Americans that Trump presents an existential threat to every core American value — democracy, freedom, and the Constitution. This is purely Orwellian. It is the Democratic Party and the rest of the Left that threatens democracy, freedom, and the Constitution. Some excerpts from his speech: “Today, we gather in a new year, some 246 years later, just one day before Jan. 6, a day forever shared in our memory because it was on that day that we nearly lost America — lost it all.” What happened on Jan. 6 was shameful, foolish, and when violent (which it overwhelmingly was not), criminal. But to say “on that day we nearly lost America — lost it all” is a lie. “Trump’s claims about the 2020 election never could stand up in court. Trump lost 60 court cases — 60.” The statement is false because no Trump claim about the 2020 election results was ever allowed to be heard on the merits in an American courtroom. “And since that day, more than 1,200 people have been charged for their assault on the Capitol. Nearly 900 of them have been convicted or pled guilty. Collectively, to date, they have been sentenced to more than 840 years in prison.” The vast majority of those imprisoned people engaged in no violence and did nothing more wrong than trespass. “So, hear me clearly. I’ll say what Donald Trump won’t. Political violence is never, ever acceptable in the United States political system — never, never, never. It has no place in a democracy. None.” That is another lie. 2020 saw a staggering amount of left-wing violence, and apparently it did have “a place in a democracy.” “He’s threatened the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the death penalty.” What Trump said was that the meeting of Gen. Mark A. Milley, the just-retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with the Chinese government after the Capitol protests, was “an act so egregious that, in times gone by, the punishment would have been death.” That was an observation about the serious nature of Milley’s violation of diplomatic norms, not a threat to sentence Milley to death. “This coming from a president who, when he visited a cemetery, called dead soldiers ‘suckers’ and ‘losers.’ Remember that?” Even Snopes and The Washington Post concluded that there is no evidence for Trump having said that about the soldiers who died at Normandy Beach. Even John Bolton, who wrote a scathing attack on Trump after leaving office, defended Trump against this claim made by an anonymous source cited by The Atlantic. Yet Biden declares it as a fact. “America, as we begin this election year, we must be clear: Democracy is on the ballot. Your freedom is on the ballot.” If democracy and freedom are on the ballot, it is because the Left, of which the Democratic Party is its political arm, threatens democracy and freedom. But Joe Biden knows that he has the entire mainstream media and all the giant social media companies except for X, formerly Twitter, on his side. So, he can hide his record and stoke hatred for Trump and his supporters from now until November. And get away with it. This column was originally posted on Townhall.com.

Writer TOPICS: WASHINGTON (AP) — A handful of super powerful tropical storms in the last decade and the prospect of more to come has a couple of experts proposing a new category of whopper hurricanes: Category 6. Studies have shown that the strongest tropical storms are getting more intense because of climate change. So the traditional five-category Saffir-Simpson scale, developed more than 50 years ago, may not show the true power of the most muscular storms, two climate scientists suggest in a Monday study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. They propose a sixth category for storms with winds that exceed 192 miles per hour (309 kilometers per hour). Currently, storms with winds of 157 mph (252 kilometers per hour) or higher are Category 5. The study\'s authors said that open-ended grouping doesn\'t warn people enough about the higher dangers from monstrous storms that flirt with 200 mph (322 kph) or higher. Several experts told The Associated Press they don\'t think another category is necessary. They said it could even give the wrong signal to the public because it\'s based on wind speed, while water is by far the deadliest killer in hurricanes. Since 2013, five storms — all in the Pacific — had winds of 192 mph or higher that would have put them in the new category, with two hitting the Philippines. As the world warms, conditions grow more ripe for such whopper storms, including in the Gulf of Mexico, where many storms that hit the United States get stronger, the study authors said. It\'s not that there are more storms because of climate change. But the strongest are more intense. The proportion of major hurricanes among all storms is increasing and it\'s because of warmer oceans, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy, who wasn\'t part of the research. From time to time, experts have proposed a Category 6, especially since Typhoon Haiyan reached 195 mph wind speeds (315 kilometers per hour) over the open Pacific. But Haiyan ""does not appear to be an isolated case,"" the study said. Storms of sufficient wind speed are called hurricanes if they form east of the international dateline, and typhoons if they form to the west of the line. They\'re known as cyclones in the Indian Ocean and Australia. The five storms that hit 192 mph winds or more are: — 2013\'s Haiyan, which killed more than 6,300 people in the Philippines. — 2015\'s Hurricane Patricia, which hit 215 mph (346 kph) before weakening and hitting Jalisco, Mexico. — 2016\'s Typhoon Meranti, which reached 195 mph before skirting the Philippines and Taiwan and making landfall in China. — 2020\'s Typhoon Goni, which reached 195 mph before killing dozens in the Philippines as a weaker storm. — 2021\'s Typhoon Surigae, which also reached 195 mph before weakening and skirting several parts of Asia and Russia. If the world sticks with just five storm categories ""as these storms get stronger and stronger it will more and more underestimate the potential risk,"" said study co-author Jim Kossin, a former NOAA climate and hurricane researcher now with First Street Foundation. Pacific storms are stronger because there\'s less land to weaken them and more room for storms to grow more intense, unlike the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean, Kossin said. So far no Atlantic storm has reached the 192 mph potential threshold, but as the world warms more the environment for such a storm grows more conducive, Kossin and Wehner said. Wehner said that as temperatures rise, the number of days with conditions ripe for potential Category 6 storms in the Gulf of Mexico will grow. Now it\'s about 10 days a year where the environment could be right for a Category 6, but that could go up to a month if the globe heats to 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. That would make an Atlantic Category 6 much more likely. MIT hurricane expert Kerry Emanuel said Wehner and Kossin ""make a strong case for changing the scale,"" but said it\'s unlikely to happen because authorities know most hurricane damage comes from storm surge and other flooding. Jamie Rhome, deputy director of the National Hurricane Center, said when warning people about storms his office tries ""to steer the focus toward the individual hazards, which include storm surge, wind, rainfall, tornadoes and rip currents, instead of the particular category of the storm, which only provides information about the hazard from wind. Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale already captures \'catastrophic damage\' from wind so it\'s not clear there would be a need for another category even if the storms were to get stronger."" McNoldy, former Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Craig Fugate, and University of Albany atmospheric sciences professor Kristen Corbosiero all say they don\'t see the necessity for a sixth and stronger storm category. ""Perhaps I\'ll change my tune when a rapidly intensifying storm in the Gulf achieves a Category 6,"" Corbosiero said in an email.'}]"

tentatively sided with state Attorney General Rob Bonta in a dispute over the title of a proposed ballot measure that would require school staff to notify parents if their child asks to change gender

The Rocklin Unified School District has voted to approve a policy requiring teachers and school staff to notify parents if their children request to be identified as anything other than their biological sex. The Rocklin School Board voted to approve a policy requiring staff to notify parents if students request to be identified as a gender other than the child\'s biological sex or access sex-segregated school programs, bathrooms, or changing facilities. The school board chambers were packed Wednesday, with some showing the emotions of the decision on their faces and some with signs. Some of the board members in favor said this is not a political or religious agenda and that the policy did not break state or federal law.

""The wind was blowing just as hard as I\'ve ever seen it blow,” Cagle said. “The power went out about 7:30 p.m. last night, and it stayed out till about 10 o\'clock this morning."" He said he was saddened to hear a neighbor lost his life trying to keep a redwood from landing on his home at Tres Picos Drive. “I\'m elderly myself,” Cagle said. “You\'re always concerned when something like that might happen just out of nowhere. It\'s pretty tragic. It really is tragic. I\'m sure his family\'s just as heartbroken as they can be."" Chuck Smith, a Sutter County spokesman, said the storm brought the worst wind the county has experienced since 2008. “We happen to have families who are out of homes this morning because of trees going into their house and that\'s a very traumatic experience I\'m sure,” Smith said. An ABC10 reporter driving through Yuba City saw toppled trees, a trampoline in a fence, and several traffic lights out. “When we talked to PG&E, they were in excess of 10,000 customers in Sutter County without power,” Smith said. “Currently, there\'s about 5,000.” Smith said the reason PG&E is taking so long to restore power is because of the volume of people without power throughout the state. Sutter County has crews working on clean-up, too, he said. While clean-up occurs, the community continues to send their condolences to Gomes’ family. ""We pray for them,” Cagle said. “Our hearts are broken that something like this happened to somebody... They have our prayers and thoughts.""

civiles podrían causarle estragos financieros, dijeron expertos legales. Trump recibió el mes pasado una indemnización de $83 millones en el caso de difamación de E. Jean Carroll y enfrenta la perspectiva de otro veredicto en los próximos días que podría ser múltiplo de eso, al mismo tiempo que desmantela partes de la empresa de la que proviene su riqueza. Esa combinación ""sería un golpe financiero devastador"" y podría ""tener un impacto significativo"" en su riqueza, dijo Chris Mattei, un abogado que ha manejado casos similares. El portavoz de la campaña de Trump, Steven Cheung, dijo que Trump ""construyó las propiedades más grandes del mundo y un negocio incomparable y tremendamente exitoso"", y calificó los casos en su contra como ""caza de brujas"". ""Los veredictos injustos serán apelados y todos los engaños serán derrotados, ya que el presidente Trump no hizo nada malo y la verdad prevalecerá"", afirmó Cheung. He aquí un vistazo al tsunami financiero que Trump enfrenta rápidamente. Trump recibió un veredicto de 83.3 millones el 26 de enero por difamar repetidamente a Carroll y ha dicho que planea apelar lo antes posible. Ya está apelando un veredicto de $5 millones que Carroll le ganó el año pasado por abuso sexual y difamación. Si bien la apelación podría demorar a Carroll en cobrar su dinero durante años mientras avanza el proceso judicial, no impide que Trump tenga que conseguir ese dinero, y algo más. Según las normas de los tribunales federales, los acusados civiles deben depositar una garantía para las indemnizaciones mientras apelan, y en Nueva York, eso incluye una tasa de interés anual del 9%. Para la indemnización de $5 millones, Trump tuvo que depositar $5.5 millones en un fondo judicial: el 111% del monto del fallo. Dado el tamaño de la nueva indemnización, Trump podría intentar utilizar una fianza en lugar de pagar el monto total, pero eso aún podría ser muy costoso porque las compañías de fianzas pueden cobrar hasta el 5% del monto de la sentencia. Para Trump, esa tarifa no reembolsable sería de aproximadamente $4 millones, y aún tendría que aportar una gran cantidad en efectivo y garantía para asegurar el bono. ""Nadie va a otorgarle a Donald Trump una fianza por $83 millonesa menos que se garantice el monto total"", dijo Ron Kuby, un veterano abogado de Nueva York. ""Sería una locura"". Cuando la fiscal general de Nueva York, Letitia James, demandó por primera vez a Trump, su empresa y sus altos ejecutivos en 2022, pedía $250 millones en daños y perjuicios por ""fraude repetido"" centrado en los estados financieros de Trump. El mes pasado, aumentó la cantidad a $370 millones. Trump y la compañía han negado haber actuado mal y sostienen que el caso tiene motivaciones políticas. Se espera que el juez Arthur Engoron emita su decisión sobre cuánto debería pagar Trump en la próxima semana, pero ya descubrió que Trump y sus ejecutivos han cometido fraude repetido y persistente, lo que no augura nada bueno para el equipo Trump. Trump ya ha dicho que apelaría si Engoron falla en su contra, pero si lo hace, lo más probable es que todavía tenga que pagar el monto total. David Slarskey, un abogado especializado en litigios comerciales, dijo que el tribunal estatal de Nueva York, al igual que el tribunal federal, exige una garantía o una fianza y que, dado el tamaño probable de la indemnización, Trump probablemente tomará medidas para obtener una fianza. Si James obtiene los $370 millones que busca, podría costarle a Trump hasta $18 millones no reembolsables a la compañía de fianzas. Y con la tasa de interés del 9%, la cantidad de dinero que habría que aportar estaría en el rango de los $400 millones. Mattei, que representó a las familias de las víctimas del tiroteo masivo en la escuela primaria Sandy Hook en Connecticut en su exitosa demanda por difamación contra el teórico de la conspiración de extrema derecha Alex Jones, dijo que si Trump y su compañía reciben un juicio que excede su capacidad de pagar, la empresa ""podría declararse en quiebra"".

Adam Leitman Bailey, un abogado de bienes raíces de Nueva York que ha demandado a Trump anteriormente, dijo que lo más probable es que tendría que pagar el 10% de la sentencia en efectivo y utilizar la propiedad como garantía para el monto restante. ""Se postula para presidente de Estados Unidos. No irá a ninguna parte"". Kuby dijo que cualquier compañía de bonos también querría garantía total para esa apelación. ""Sería casi cuatro veces más loco que hacerlo por 83 millones de dólares sin garantía"", afirmó.

Si Trump gana, podría recuperar todo el dinero que aportó, más los intereses, pero perdería todo lo que tuviera que pagar a la compañía de bonos. Según una declaración de situación financiera de 2021 que se presentó como prueba en el caso de fraude, Trump tenía cerca de $293.8 millones “en efectivo y equivalentes de efectivo”. La Fiscalía dijo que esa cifra era artificialmente alta y que incluía $93 millones en activos que no son líquidos. La declaración, que se elaboró durante la pandemia, cifra su patrimonio neto en $4,500 millones, una cifra que Trump considera demasiado baja. “No incluimos miles de millones de dólares en valor de marca”, dijo Trump sobre sus estados financieros en una declaración de octubre de 2022.

leaving her role with former President Donald Trump, with both agreeing to delay a decision until after South Carolina\'s Feb. 24 primary, according to two people familiar with the matter. McDaniel has not formally decided to step down and leave her role as head of the GOP\'s political machine, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose internal deliberations. But having long faced vocal opposition from a faction of the party, McDaniel is under renewed pressure after Trump publicly questioned whether she should stay in the job. During what was described as a cordial private meeting Monday in Florida, Trump and McDaniel discussed the possibility that she would step down as one of a range of possibilities for changes within RNC leadership. But they agreed not to make any final decisions until after South Carolina\'s primary, in which Trump is seeking to deliver a knockout blow to his last major challenger, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, a native of the state and its former governor. “Nothing has changed,"" RNC spokesperson Keith Schipper said in a statement. ""This will be decided after South Carolina.” A potential successor being discussed is Michael Whatley, who has been the North Carolina GOP chair since 2019, according to a third person familiar with the matter. Whatley also serves as general counsel to the RNC. An adamant backer of Trump’s “stop the steal” efforts, Whatley ran last year for co-chair of the RNC with Trump’s backing. But he trailed badly and withdrew from the contest for the party’s second top-ranking post. McDaniel has faced vocal opposition from leading far-right figures who largely blamed her for the GOP’s political struggles since Trump\'s 2016 election. That’s even as Trump himself publicly and privately backed McDaniel, who is Utah Sen. Mitt Romney’s niece. Trump first tapped her to lead the committee in 2017. McDaniel is in the midst of her fourth two-year term. Under the direction of the party\'s presidential nominee, whoever serves as chair will direct the sprawling nationwide infrastructure designed to elect a Republican president while serving as a chief party fundraiser.

The mayor reportedly claimed the initiative would save the city $6.7 million per year. It would purportedly cut food supply costs for the immigrants while reducing the city’s overall financial burden for migrant care. The program would offer 500 migrants cards providing for $12 worth of food per day, although families could receive more. Adams determined it would reduce waste. ""We have a pilot project with 500 people that we are giving them food cards, so instead of a debit card, instead of having to deliver food and have people eat food – we were seeing wasting food – they’re now able to get their own food,"" he explained, according to FOX News.

Cards would only work at bodegas, convenience stores and supermarkets, and recipients must sign an affidavit swearing to use the funds solely for food and baby supplies. Migrants would be able to refill the cards every 28 days. If the program yields positive results, Adams would support its expansion. The mayor’s program coincides with Gov. Kathy Hochul’s desire to fast-track immigrants’ employment processes for government jobs. The New York Department of Civil Service proposed easing requirements like English language proficiency, education verification and certification for approximately 4,000 positions earlier this month. New York City has struggled to address its immigrant influx, which the mayor projects will cost the city $12 billion by the end of the 2025 fiscal year. The state has also incurred a $1.9 billion price tag for its 160,000 illegal migrants. Follow Ray Lewis on X for trending national news @rayjlewis'}]"

Bombs ripped through two separate political offices in southwestern Pakistan on Wednesday, killing at least 30 people, officials said, the day before the country was set to elect a new parliament. The attacks in Baluchistan province — home to a low-level insurgency and various militants groups — raised concerns for the election in the troubled Western ally, where many voters are already disillusioned by political feuding and a seemingly intractable economic crisis. Violence ahead of elections and on the day of polling is common in Pakistan, which has struggled to rein in various militant groups. Tens of thousands of police and paramilitary forces have been deployed across the country following a recent surge in attacks, especially in Baluchistan. Hours later, the Islamic State group\'s branch in Pakistan claimed Wednesday\'s second attack. At least 18 people were killed in the first attack at independent candidate Asfandyar Khan\'s election office in the Pashin district, Jumadad Mandokhel, a government official, said. Shortly after, another bombing killed at least 12 people at the Jamiat Ulema Islam party office in Qilla Saifullah, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) away, according to Jan Achakzai, the spokesman for the provincial government. He said the elections would not be delayed despite the bombings. The attacks, which left more than two dozen people wounded, drew condemnation from almost all the political parties. Jamiat Ulema Islam — a leading radical Islamist party that has close ties with Afghanistan\'s Taliban — has been attacked by the Islamic State group and other militants in recent years. At least 54 people were killed in July when a suicide bomber blew himself up at party rally. An Afghan branch of the Islamic State group claimed that attack. Party president Fazlur Rehman and scores of candidates from the party are contesting the elections throughout the country. Baluchistan, a gas-rich province on the border with Afghanistan and Iran, has been the scene of an insurgency for more than two decades by Baluch nationalists who are seeking independence. The nationalists typically attack security forces — not civilian or political targets in the province. The outlawed Baluchistan Liberation Army has been behind multiple attacks on security forces, including one on Jan. 30 that killed six people. The Pakistani Taliban, along with other militant groups, also have a strong presence in Baluchistan and have targeted civilians in recent years, though the Pakistani Taliban pledged not to attack election rallies ahead of the vote. Abdullah Khan, an analyst at the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, said more violence could not be ruled out on the election day. He said any of a number of groups could be behind the latest bombings, including the splinter groups within the Pakistani Taliban, Islamic State, Baluch nationalists or al-Qaida. Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul-Haq-Kakar denounced the attacks and conveyed his condolences to the families of those who died. He vowed that ""every attempt to sabotage the law and order situation will be thwarted"" and said the government is committed to holding elections Thursday in peace. Achakzai, the provincial government spokesman, announced a three-day mourning period but emphasized that ""the elections will take place on Thursday as per the schedule, and we urge people to exercise their right to vote to defeat those who wanted a delay in the elections."" In 2007, Pakistan\'s two-time prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, was killed in a gun and bomb attack, minutes after she addressed an election rally in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. Her son, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, has led the campaign for her Pakistan People\'s Party amid tight security. Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.'}]"
