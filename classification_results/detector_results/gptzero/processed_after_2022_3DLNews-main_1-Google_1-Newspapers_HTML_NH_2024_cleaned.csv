Montgomery testifies during the trial of Adam Montgomery at Hillsborough County Superior Court in Manchester, N.H, on Friday, Feb. 9, 2024. Adam Montgomery is accused of killing his 5-year-old daughter and spending months moving her body before disposing of it. (Jeffrey Hastings/Pool Photo via AP) CONCORD (AP) — The estranged wife of a New Hampshire man accused of beating his young daughter to death testified Friday that he punched the 5-year-old to death, folded her body into a duffel bag, then hid it in the trunk of his car, then a ceiling vent and a restaurant freezer while deciding how to dispose of the body. Kayla Montgomery testified that her stepdaughter, Harmony Montgomery, whose body has not been found, died Dec. 7, 2019, in a car the family was living in after getting evicted. It was the third day of Adam Montgomery’s murder trial in Manchester, which he hasn’t been attending. Kayla Montgomery said Harmony was potty trained, but had begun having frequent accidents. She testified that her husband punched Harmony in the head after two such accidents in the car. He later covered Harmony with a blanket as the child cried, moaned and eventually went silent, the stepmother said. Their car broke down soon afterward and Adam Montgomery put Harmony’s body in the duffel bag, she said. “He, like, folded her in half and put her in the duffel bag,” she said. Adam Montgomery, 34, is charged with second-degree murder, assault and witness tampering. In opening statements Thursday, his lawyers acknowledged he was guilty of two other charges — falsifying evidence and abusing a corpse. But they said he did not kill Harmony and repeatedly suggested Kayla Montgomery was lying to protect herself. “Only she knows the truth,” public defender James T. Brooks told the jury on Thursday. “And only she has benefitted from all the lies she has told.” Prosecutors asked Kayla Montgomery to look at jurors Friday as she told them she did not kill the girl. Under cross examination, she acknowledged that she similarly looked at grand jurors in May 2022 and falsely told them she didn’t know what had happened to her stepdaughter. “So, looking at jurors while you’re lying doesn’t change the lie, right?” asked defense attorney Caroline Smith. “Right,” said Montgomery, who is serving an 18-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to perjury for lying during grand jury testimony about where she was when Harmony was last seen. Under questioning by Smith, she acknowledged at least a dozen other false statements. “You said the last time you saw Harmony, she was happy,” Smith said. “You had no problem with lying to the grand jury.” Police didn’t learn that Harmony was missing until December 2021, nearly two years after she was last seen alive. Kayla Montgomery said she put her arm up to stop her husband from hitting Harmony on Dec. 7, but that “he gave me this look that was like, evil, his crazy eyes.” “I was scared,” she said. She also testified that her husband told her he had struck Harmony after she saw the girl with a black eye in July 2019. The duffel bag made it from the trunk of a friend’s car to a hallway cooler near an apartment where Kayla Montgomery’s mother lived, and then to a ceiling vent in a shelter where the family stayed for about six weeks. Eventually, Harmony’s remains began to smell, and Adam Montgomery moved them into trash bags which he put into a large tote bag, Kayla Montgomery testified. She said she put the bag in a stroller and took it to a restaurant where her husband worked, and he put it in the freezer. He later moved the bag to the refrigerator of an apartment where they were staying in Manchester. Adam Montgomery talked about dismembering Harmony and bought tools and lime, she testified. She said he put the body in the bathtub and turned on the shower to thaw it, and asked her to help him cut off Harmony’s clothes, which she did. She left the room soon after that. “I couldn’t be there anymore. I couldn’t handle it. I didn’t want to see anything,” she said. Under cross examination, Smith reminded Montgomery that she accurately described Harmony’s clothing in her grand jury testimony in 2022 but didn’t mention that she helped cut them off. “You talked to the jury with a straight face about remembering what she was wearing,” said Smith, who said the stepmother lied to shift the blame to her husband. Montgomery, who will return to the stand Monday, said her husband drove away with Harmony’s remains in a rental truck in March 2020, and that he didn’t say where he was going. Not long after that, he started to suspect that she might go to the police, so he began punching her, giving her black eyes, she said. She eventually ran away from him in March 2021. Montgomery also was a prosecution witness last year in an unrelated case in which her husband was convicted of gun theft charges.

Ehrhart With Ron DeSantis’s withdrawal from the Republican presidential field, and Nicki Haley’s defeat in New Hampshire, it seems that only an act of God will prevent Donald Trump from returning to the White House. Joe Biden was already an old man when he accepted the nomination for president in 2020. He got the nomination because he was perceived as the only Democrat who had a chance of defeating the ignorant, narcissistic, racist, homophobic, misogynistic, criminal, immoral, amoral, reality-starring grifter who’d been occupying the White House for the previous four years. Uncle Joe won the presidency only because he was not the ignorant, narcissistic, racist, homophobic, misogynistic, criminal, immoral, amoral, reality-starring grifter who’d been occupying the White House for the previous four years. Biden was supposed to be a “caretaker” president, a one-termer who, by election day 2024, would be days shy of 82 years old. One need only look at photos of former presidents at the beginning of their terms and at the end of just four years to see the toll that being president of the United States takes on the aging process of even much younger men. One can only speculate about the toll these past three years have taken on Biden, and he’s still got more than a year to go with another bruising campaign ahead of him. I’d say, “Good Luck,” but he’s going to need a lot more than luck. Why did Biden decide—clearly very early on in his presidency—that he would stand for a second term? And why on Earth has his party allowed him to do it? Once again, the Democratic Party has shown itself to be extremely adept at shooting its collective self in the foot. The first mistake this time around was choosing Kamala Harris as a running mate. Hey, what could be better? A woman, and a woman of color at that. And not just Black, but also Asian. Three-for-one. What a brilliant choice! But Harris did so poorly as a presidential candidate that she called off her campaign before 2020 even started. She had a controversial background as a prosecutor, first as district attorney in San Francisco and then as attorney general of California. She often referred to herself as the “top cop,” but by 2020 and the murder of George Floyd, that was not exactly a popular monicker. And it became clear soon after she took office that she had not been a wise choice. She did not mesh with the Biden team, and she is not at all charismatic or inspirational. It became very clear very early on that she was not going to step into the ring in 2024 and take the reins from Uncle Joe. So what does the Democratic Party do at that point? How do you repudiate your sitting vice president and begin grooming someone new for the nomination in 2024? I suppose the Democrats saw that prospect as doomed to fail politically. And you certainly couldn’t give Harris the nomination for president outright. And that left only a second term for Biden. Unfortunately for the Democratic Party, that solution is also doomed to fail politically. And it doesn’t matter if Joe Biden still has all his marbles. Nor does it matter that he’s actually managed to get quite a bit done in the past three years in spite of some enormous disadvantages in the form of obstacles like Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, Joe Manchin, and the self-proclaimed “Freedom Caucus.” The fact is that Joe Biden is simply not inspirational. He does not excite people—especially young voters—the way Bernie Sanders did in 2016. (More on that anon.) He comes across as exactly what he is: an old man. It’s not an image problem. It’s just what he is. Biden won the 2020 election only because enough people had had enough of Donald Trump, and wanted him gone. Voters came out in record numbers. They voted for Uncle Joe because he was not Donald Trump. But three years later, they’ve still got Trump. In the headlines every single day. Still at large in spite of four indictments on 91 felony charges. As outrageous as ever. As ridiculous as ever. As incoherent as ever. As popular as ever. And the presumptive Republican nominee for the presidency of the United States in 2024. Don’t forget: though the Democratic Party got more votes than ever before in 2020, so did the Republican Party. And huge numbers of those voters were diehard MAGA supporters of Dolt .45. And still are. They will show up at the polls again in 2024; you can bet your future on that, alas. You will not see the same fanatical devotion for Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. The voters who decide to stay home this time will not be the Trumpsters. They will be young voters dismayed by Biden’s support of a murderous government in Israel that has long since dwarfed the unarguably outrageous crimes of Hamas. They will be older voters who are disillusioned with Biden and don’t fully grasp the consequences of allowing Dolt. 45 to become Dolt .47. The Democratic Party has been shooting its collective self in the foot ever since it allowed Bill Clinton to turn his back on working Americans, got in bed with the financial elite, and created the Party of Republican Lite. Barack Obama was supposed to “Yes We Can,” but he immediately brought a lot of the people responsible for the economic disaster of 2008 into his administration. And then the Democratic Party ran roughshod over the popular will of rank-and-file voters in 2016, and cheated Bernie Sanders out of the nomination in favor of the immensely polarizing and unelectable Hillary Clinton. This time, the Democratic Party has collectively shot itself in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun. But I would like to have something positive to say, something hopeful. I would like to be able to posit an alternative outcome for the 2024 election. Though overweight, Big Mac-eating Donald Trump is, after all, nearly as old as Uncle Joe, and can’t be in any better health, we simply can’t sit back, do nothing, and count on an Act of God to save us from what seems to be inevitable. So what should the Democratic Party do? It is now far too late for Uncle Joe to withdraw his candidacy. But can’t he at least make Kamala Harris go away? Get her to say that she has to spend more time with her family, or work on her gardening, or something? And then pick a vice presidential candidate who is more inspiring, and might actually make an attractive running mate? Gretchen Witmer? Julian Castro? Mark Kelly? There’s gotta be some younger Democrat who’s a lot more appealing than Kamala Harris, who brings nothing to the Biden ticket but dead weight. Biden’s got nothing to lose by giving this strategy a try, and everything to lose if he doesn’t. –=≈=– W. D.

According to a press release, the New Hampshire Congressional delegation, led by Sens. Jean Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, along with Reps. Annie Kuster and Chris Pappas, sent a letter to FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell expressing their support for the affected local communities. The storm resulted in extensive road closures, infrastructure damage and home destructions in northern New Hampshire, leading to the rescue of some residents by National Guard helicopters. The delegation urges FEMA to be prepared to conduct Preliminary Damage Assessments in collaboration with state and local officials, should the state request it, especially as impending snowfall could complicate the assessment of the full extent of the damage. On the state level, the HSEM, on behalf of Gov. Chris Sununu, initiated joint Preliminary Damage Assessments with FEMA to document the impact on communities, which is crucial for securing federal disaster relief funds. HSEM had nine teams visiting affected communities to assess initial damage estimates, working closely with communities to determine whether they meet the state threshold of $2.53 million in damages. Food help NH Hunger Solutions and other anti-hunger advocates plan to attend a public hearing in Concord on Jan. 3 for SB499, the Hunger Free NH Act. According to a press release, this bipartisan legislation, led by Sen. Becky Whitley (D-Hopkinton) and introduced for the 2024 session, aims to address food insecurity in New Hampshire. Key objectives of the act include increasing participation in Federal Nutrition Programs (FNPs), removing administrative barriers for accessing these programs and improving participation in School Breakfast and Summer Meals programs. The act also focuses on making it easier for older adults and people with disabilities to access food and nutrition benefits.”Our food and nutrition support system is designed to work like a power grid that can move healthy food to communities and households — the problem is that the grid is well-powered in some areas and patchy or even non-existent in others,” Executive Director of NH Hunger Solutions Laura Milliken said in the release. “At the same time, rising costs of goods, housing and child care are straining household budgets. For many, it is increasingly difficult to meet basic needs.” Milliken noted that over half of New Hampshire children and 46 percent of adults live in households with insufficient food as of Oct. 30. “The Hunger Free NH Act will connect more Granite Staters with nutritious food and bolster our food support system in NH,” she said. Historic registry The Bald Peak Colony Club in Moultonborough has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a notable example of a rural country club from the 1920s, according to a press release. Located with views of Lake Winnipesaukee and surrounded by the Belknap and Ossipee mountain ranges, the club was founded in 1921. It stands out as one of New Hampshire’s most preserved historic golf clubs, featuring 93 contributing buildings, sites and structures that maintain the Colonial Revival architectural style. The club’s facilities include a symmetrical clubhouse, early cottages near the clubhouse, a variety of recreational buildings, and an 18-hole golf course that has kept its original layout since 1919. The listing on the National Register, administered by the National Park Service, recognizes the property’s historical significance without imposing new restrictions on it. It also makes the property eligible for certain state grants aimed at conservation and heritage investment. Corrections training The New Hampshire Department of Corrections has partnered with the National Alliance on Mental Illness New Hampshire (NAMI NH) for a training initiative funded by a grant from the Governor’s Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs. According to a press release, this collaboration aims to equip all corrections staff with specialized skills through programs like Building a Trauma-Responsive Correctional Setting and Crisis Intervention Training, with a focus on application in correctional environments. This move comes after a significant number of individuals were referred for behavioral and substance use services upon booking, highlighting the need for enhanced staff training. The initiative, starting in Fiscal Year 2025, seeks to improve outcomes for justice-involved individuals with mental illness and support corrections staff in managing complex issues within the criminal justice system.

Holloway, 41, was sentenced by Judge Charles Temple on charges of attempted murder, first-degree assault and felony possession of a firearm when he opened fire at New England Pentecostal Ministries on Oct. 12, 2019. Holloway, who declined his transfer from prison to attend the hearing, is already serving 7½ to 9 years in prison for assaulting his defense attorney shortly after he was arrested for the shooting. At the sentencing, both Bishop Stanley Choate and bride Claire McMullen gave victim impact statements about how their injuries and the shooting affected their lives and left them injured. “The physical impact left me disabled,” McMullen said. “The bullet went through my right arm and caused nerve damage, affecting my dominant hand.” Holloway was found guilty on Friday, Nov. 10, of six out of seven charges. It took eight days of presenting physical evidence, including testimony from the bride, groom, pastor, best man, bridesmaid, and two different videos. In addition to Choate and McMullen, Mark Castiglione, the groom and a resident of Londonderry, was also assaulted during the Oct. 12, 2019 shooting at New England Pentecostal Ministries. Holloway is the step-son of Luis Garcia, a former minister at the church, who was murdered by Brandon Castiglione on Oct. 1, 2019, in Londonderry at Mark Castiglione’s house. Brandon Castiglione was sentenced to 42 years in prison, and Mark Castiglione is his father. Holloway pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease and defect, a defense that claims even though he committed the crimes, he didn’t have the mental stability to be held responsible for them.

The estranged wife of the man accused of killing his own daughter in 2019 returned to the stand Monday after spending the entire day testifying Friday. Adam Montgomery, 34, faces charges of second-degree murder, second-degree assault, witness tampering, abuse of a corpse and falsifying physical evidence in connection with the death of his daughter Harmony.

The trial is expected to resume at 9 a.m. Tuesday. From Tim Callery: Brief cross-examination of Frain by the defense to clarify what kind of car the Montgomerys were living in. Frain says she believes blue Audi. Frain is dismissed as a witness. Both sides are now at the bench with the judge. From Tim Callery: Frain says in the winter of 2019 she delivered jumper cables to the Montgomerys. She says she did not see Harmony with them. From Tim Callery: We\'re now hearing from Kimberly Frain. She worked with Adam Montgomery and Kayla Montgomery at a Dunkin\' in Manchester. She says she babysat Harmony Montgomery and her two brothers in the summer of 2019. From Tim Callery: The defense asks a brief question on cross-examination to clarify that Adam Montgomery was willing to stay with Courtney Garcia, but Kayla Montgomery was against it. Garcia is dismissed. From Tim Callery: Courtney Garcia says between December 2019-January 2020 she saw the family multiple times. She says Adam Montgomery told her that Harmony was back living with her mother because she kept having accidents in the car. From Tim Callery: Courtney Garcia says Adam Montgomery was for staying with them, but he and Kayla Montgomery decided not to spend the night. She says Adam Montgomery and Kayla Montgomery\'s two sons and Harmony were in the back seat of the car. Garcia offered the kids food. From Tim Callery: Courtney Garcia says she saw Adam Montgomery on Thanksgiving in 2019. She says her husband gave him gas money and offered to give him a place to stay. From Tim Callery: After another nearly six-hour day of testimony, Kayla Montgomery\'s time on the stand comes to an end. The state has called its next witness, Courtney Garcia. She says Adam Montgomery is a childhood friend of her husband. From Tim Callery: Defense asked Kayla Montgomery if she was aware that Adam Montgomery was conceding to abuse of a corpse charge and falsifying evidence charge. Kayla Montgomery says she learned this because her attorney spoke to her about it the morning of her testimony. From Tim Callery: Court is back in session. There was no mention of what happened at the bench. The defense is continuing its questioning of Kayla Montgomery about what was said in opening statements by Adam Montgomery\'s attorneys. From Tim Callery: Sidebar is still going on at the bench w/Kayla\'s attorney, prosecutors and the defense. They\'ve been up there for quite some time. Kayla has just entered the courtroom. From Tim Callery: Court is back in session, but the judge just asked Kayla Montgomery\'s attorney to approach the bench. He was setting in the gallery during her testimony. Prosecution and defense are also there. From Tim Callery: The defense asks Kayla Montgomery how she knew information about opening statements. She says, ""My lawyer."" The defense tries to clarify when judge called attorneys up to the bench. We are now in a 15-minute break. From Tim Callery: Prosecutor: Can you remind these jurors who killed Harmony? Kayla Montgomery: Adam Montgomery. The state has finished with redirect. The defense is allowed to ask follow-up questions. From Tim Callery: Kayla Montgomery is emotional again while telling jurors she no longer has rights to her children. She can no longer speak to them. She also tells the jurors she was not given full immunity and is currently living at the New Hampshire State Prison for Women. From Tim Callery: Prosecutor: Did you beat Harmony to death? Kayla Montgomery: No. From Tim Callery: Prosecutors just asked Kayla Montgomery if she still loves Adam Montgomery. She said she still cares about him. ""He was my best friend. It\'s been hard to let go,"" Kayla Montgomery says as she wipes away tears. From Tim Callery: Prosecutors are circling back to Adam Montgomery\'s abuse of Kayla Montgomery. She reiterates that the abuse was physical and emotional and says Adam Montgomery accused her of cheating on him and working with cops. From Tim Callery: The defense just asked Kayla Montgomery about Adam Montgomery wanting to commit suicide. Kayla Montgomery said she told Adam Montgomery that she needed him and their kids needed him. The defense is done with questioning. Prosecutors now have a chance for follow-up questions during redirect. From Amy Coveno: I always wondered what “publish to the jury” meant. If a lawyer wants to show the jury a piece of evidence, they first must present it to the other side, privately, and then to the witness. Then, they must ask the judge to approve the evidence to be shown to the jury and the judge says, ""Yes, you may publish to the jury,"" and only THEN does the jury see the photograph or document. From Tim Callery: Defense notes Kayla originally told police she did not help Adam with Harmony\'s body, but later admitted that she cut Harmony\'s sweatshirt off and helped close a bag that her remains were put in. From Tim Callery: We\'re back from lunch. The defense is now questioning about the family\'s time at their Union Street apartment, primarily the day Adam Montgomery allegedly reduced Harmony\'s body. From Amy Coveno: I talked with some court staffers about the process. Necca sits very close to the judge’s bench in the trial. She is called the court monitor. She described her role as ""taking minutes"" of the trial for the transcript, so she is not taking verbatim notes on the testimony. That is automated. But she does mark the times and subject matter in minutes form in case the judge or the lawyer need to find particular testimony in the transcript. Also, at the beginning of the trial, the jury clerk walked in with a wooden box. Inside that box are the names of all 17 jurors. The names of the jury pool are printed out and when a juror checks in for service, they take their name. Once selected, they put their name inside that wooden box – and it’s presented to the court for safe keeping. From Tim Callery: The jury is now out on lunch. Testimony will resume in one hour. From Amy Coveno: The defense is now recounting Adam Montgomery trying to wake Harmony after she died. Crystal Sorey, her mother, is weeping and being comforted by a friend. From Tim Callery: Adam Montgomery\'s defense attorney has thrown several curveball questions at Kayla Montgomery, trying to get her to admit that Harmony was already dead before the time she claims Adam Montgomery killed her. Kayla Montgomery appears confused each time. From Tim Callery: With Kayla Montgomery being the state\'s star witness, this is the defense\'s chance to make a dent in the prosecution\'s case by highlighting even the smallest discrepancy in her story. From Tim Callery: The defense also asks Kayla Montgomery what her other two children were doing while Adam Montgomery was hitting Harmony. She said one of her sons was screaming. The defense notes Kayla Montgomery originally told police the children were sleeping at the time. From Tim Callery: The defense is going over every detail of Kayla Montgomery\'s testimony -- big and small, including Kayla Montgomery telling prosecutors that she fed the children as the family left the Burger King parking lot. The defense notes she told police she fed the children at the Colonial Village apartments. From Tim Callery: The judge has ordered a mid-morning break. Court will resume in 15 minutes. From Tim Callery: Last week, Kayla Montgomery testified that Adam Montgomery hit Harmony when he returned to the family\'s car from the methadone clinic and noticed Harmony had a bathroom accident. Today, she tells the defense that Harmony also had an accident around 2-3 a.m. that morning. She said Adam Montgomery hit Harmony 10-15 times. From Amy Coveno: The jury looks refreshed and is attentive despite a tedious portion of cross examination. From Tim Callery: The defense is highlighting discrepancies between what Kayla Montgomery told prosecutors on the stand about the day Harmony died and what she told law enforcement when their investigation was going on. From Amy Coveno: The defense is now pressing Kayla Montgomery on the timeline of her death. She'}]"

Hate crimes encourage people to withdraw from the community out of fear. New Hampshire is better than this, and if we are the ‘Live Free or Die’ state, then we ought to live up to our motto.” Dembele, a vice president with Bangor Savings Bank, went public with his allegations on Dec. 1, sharing in a prepared statement to Seacoastonline he was attacked and assaulted on Nov. 22. His attorney, Robin Melone, noted the alleged assailant was white. The case is open and is being investigated by local prosecutors and New Hampshire State Police, while the New Hampshire attorney general’s office is keeping tabs on it. A former Portsmouth Police Department employee might have been involved, according to Chief Mark Newport, so city police handed over the case to state police. “The words used by my attacker leave no doubt that this was a racist act,” read Dembele’s Dec. 1 statement. “The fear and fury of being attacked in my home community because I was seen as ‘other’ will never go away. … I look forward to seeing my attacker held accountable in a court of law.” City police previously noted the incident occurred on Fleet Street near Gilley’s Diner on Nov. 22 around 10:30 p.m. “And yet, in the third month (since) the attack on him happened, we are all disappointed that justice has not been rendered,” Arvelo said. “Meanwhile, there is no closure for Mamadou as he continues to heal from his physical scars and tries to heal from the psychological trauma.

But diving was part of the story as the NHIAA Dive Championships once again saw locals be major factors, and yes, including winning a title at UNH. In basketball, heartbreak for the Nashua South boys, a tight win for the North boys to extend their streak and a huge win for the South girls on the road.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:20 pm SPRINGFIELD, Vt. — For the first time since 2021, Springfield Hospital and the Apple Blossom Committee will present the famed Apple Blossom Cotillion this year on May 3 and 4. The committee announced their rehearsals with five high school senior couples and six young couples for this year’s 67th Apple Blossom Cotillion. According to the Cotillion director, Ashlee White, the theme, “Mama Mia; Here We Go Again!” has two different meanings bookending the performance for everyone involved. “The original director, John MacDonald, initially decided on the ABBA-based Broadway theme as a tribute to the return of Apple Blossom after two years for both participants and the community,” White said. According to Sandy Peplau, Springfield Hospital marketing director, the last official cotillion was in 2021 during the COVID-19 recess, and it was very different from the Apple Blossoms in years past. “What is exciting for us at Springfield Hospital is that we are able to bring Apple Blossom back. We have about 10 volunteers and it\'s fun to see all their enthusiasm,” said Peplau. ""The last Apple Blossom we had was in 2021. It was a very different kind of cotillion. It was still during COVID, we had a limited audience, all the participants wore masks. Then we have not had a cotillion in the past two years.” White said she came into the role of director after the original director had to leave. “When John had to step down, I came into the role thinking we should keep the original theme especially because it\'s popular among all ages,” White said. On Sunday, Jan. 28, the contestants gathered in the Riverside Middle School Gymnasium for their orientation meeting. Rehearsals have begun and will continue through the winter and early spring, working up to the dress rehearsal on May 3 and final performance on May 4, 2024. Both events will be open to the public. Apple Blossom is a fundraising event for Springfield Hospital that started in 1957. The community comes alive with song and dance by the youth from our area. The 2024 event will feature some of the original aspects of Apple Blossom including the 12 cotillionaires promenade. A community dance at the end of the Saturday, May 4, performance is an added attraction for this year. For more information, visit springfieldhospital.org or follow the team on Facebook here.

STAFF PHOTO BY ASHLEY SAARI A faded hand-painted sign for 676 Abbot Hill Road will be replaced with a new sign in the same style, as part of a fundraiser for the Wilton Heritage Commission. COURTESY PHOTO— By ASHLEY SAARI Monadnock Ledger-Transcript Monadnock Ledger-Transcript The Wilton Heritage Commission is hosting a fundraiser, allowing those with historic homes to mark their property with a plaque, in order to raise funds to replace some of the larger historical monument signs around town. Several houses around town already have similar plaques on their homes, marking the date it was built and often the name of one of the prominent past owners of the home. Up until now, said Heritage Commission co-Chair Deb Mortvedt, the signs were available for people who own homes built prior to 1800. For the fundraiser, any home built in or before 1900 is eligible. The previous plaques were hand-painted, and Mortvedt said one of the difficulties in replacing the plaques has been finding the right replacement sign-maker. After a four-year search, the commission has settled on Chuck Hodgdon and Stadium Graphics of Wilton, and while the new ones use the same design and shape, they are made of an aluminum alloy to prevent fading. The cost of the signs is $100, and they can be bought by the homeowner, or given as a gift. Funds from the sale of the signs will be put toward replacing at least four historical markers around town, including the sign at Abbot Hill and the kiosk by the Police Department. Mortvedt encouraged homeowners who already have a plaque and are looking to replace it due to fading to keep their previous plaque as a keepsake and as an artifact. The Heritage Commission has already had some signs commissioned, and four were transferred to their new homes last week, with Four Corners Farm, 555 Abbot Hill Road, 676 Abbot Hill Road and the “Red House” Brick Store in Wilton Center all receiving replacement plaques. Residents who own a house built on or before 1900 and would like to participate in the house plaque fundraiser should send email to heritage@wiltonnh.gov. Article continues after...

ceased publication on Feb. 1, after more than 40 years of informing readers in six southeastern New Hampshire towns and putting them in the same boat as some 70 million other Americans who already live in what are known as “news deserts.” Across the country, digital alternatives, rising printing costs, plummeting advertising revenues and consolidation have led to the downfall of publications small and large. The concept of a news desert is well known in the news industry which has been scrambling to find relevance and economic survival since the dawn of the digital age since the mid-1990s. But to the general public, it’s a reflection of the changing times. The news business competes for eyes and has found itself fighting against disinformation spread widely — and easily — via the Wild West of a mostly unregulated social media. This has become clearer in the past two decades: The industry’s traditional economic infrastructure is often at odds with quality journalism and keeping citizens informed in a democracy. Newspapers folding and merging due to economic pressures is nothing new. The sudden demise of the once formidable New York Herald Tribune in 1966 sent shock waves throughout the industry. It was the same with the equally esteemed Washington (D.C.) Star, which went bankrupt in 1981. And in a significant foreshadowing of the economic decline of the industry, The New York Times bought The Boston Globe for an estimated $1.1 billion in 1993. In 2013, it resold the newspaper for $70 million. The pace of volatility in the industry has increased dramatically, and it reverberates across the country. According to a 2022 report by the Local News Initiative — a project of Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism — an estimated 2,500 local news operations have closed since 2005, with more than 350 of them closing since the beginning of the COVID pandemic in early 2020. “More than a fifth of the nation’s citizens live in news deserts — with very limited access to local news — or in communities at risk of becoming news deserts,” the report said. “Seventy million people live in the more than 200 counties without a newspaper, or in the 1,630 counties with only one paper — usually a weekly — covering multiple communities spread over a vast area.” The consequences are real, according to the Local News Initiative report: “The loss of local journalism has been accompanied by the malignant spread of misinformation and disinformation, political polarization, eroding trust in media, and a yawning digital and economic divide among citizens. In communities without a credible source of local news, voter participation declines, corruption in both government and business increases, and local residents end up paying more in taxes” often without understanding why. “A professional news staff for a city or town matters,” said Tom Haines, a journalism professor at the University of New Hampshire in Durham. “A good newsroom is an independent forum for the community. They are the watchdog for a community, going to and reporting meetings that the general citizenry doesn’t have time to attend. They ask fact-based questions for the benefit of the community and document and record the history of a town. That can’t be replaced easily.” The changing landscape The industry has shed between 60% and 70% of newsroom jobs since 2005, and New Hampshire hasn’t been spared. Many publications have closed, merged, or are purchased by larger chains, which often employ cost-cutting strategies to get a return on investment. The Telegraph in Nashua has undergone one of most striking transformations since its purchase by West Virginia-based Ogden Newspapers in 2013. The current incarnation is a shell of its historical self. It has a much smaller newsroom and publishes a weekly print version for weekend distribution along with daily updates on the website. Nashua is the state’s second-largest city with a population of more than 90,000 with a large immigrant and refugee population. Founded in the 1860s as the New Hampshire Telegraph, the newspaper’s modern version gained national recognition in 1980 when it hosted a contentious Republican presidential debate during the New Hampshire primary. At its peak, The Telegraph had bureaus in suburban towns like Milford and a statehouse reporter. “We had two assistant editors and three reporters for the Sunday paper,” said David Brooks, who was a reporter and editor at the Telegraph for 28 years and also served for a time as Milford bureau chief. Brooks said it was important for the paper to play its role as watchdog for the public and to hold those in power accountable. But being vibrant and competent in its duties didn’t make the Telegraph any less of a target. “One of our roles was to be yelled at (by the community). We were criticized for everything, but because we were part of the personality of the city, like a church. When someone was new to the city, they looked to us to figure out what was going on.” When the presence of a vibrant newspaper is gone, Brooks said, “it’s like a hole in the soul of the city.” The new normal The loss of newsroom jobs amid constant cost-cutting measures has become the norm across the country and will likely continue — the number of communities in the country without a local news outlet is 1,800 and growing. But new models are emerging – not-for-profit newsrooms that depend mostly on donations, grants, philanthropy and out-of-the-box thinking. “The decline of local news is a sad truth across the country, and this represents a massive market failure for an industry that was dependent on advertising revenue,” said Patty Slutsky, the chief advancement officer for the American Journalism Project. The organization is working in communities across the country to launch new news organizations through grants to nonprofit news organizations and to coach leaders. According to AJP, they have raised more than $168 million since being founded in 2019. They have supported 41 fledging news organizations and seen four newsrooms launched. But systemic issues make no quick fixes likely, and much of the organizing activity is taking place in urban areas. “The situation is dire. So many newsrooms have been subjected to cost–cutting measures that there aren’t enough reporters to cover the news in their communities. They have effectively become news deserts,” Slutsky said. Professional and citizen journalists unite As newsrooms shrink and news deserts spread in New Hampshire, there has been no shortage of out-of-the-box initiatives. Nancy West, a former longtime reporter for the Union Leader, founded the nonprofit InDepthNH.org, published by the NH Center for Public Interest Journalism, in 2015 to begin filling in the investigative and local news gaps throughout the state — and sharing it with news organizations across the state for free. West began charging for content in 2019. Founded in 2019, the Granite State News Collaborative is a collective of more than 20 media, education and community partners to produce and share news stories on the issues important to New Hampshire. (This article is being produced under its umbrella.) And in 2021, New Hampshire Bulletin, another online initiative, was founded through States Newsroom, a national nonprofit supported by grants and other donors. There are also local news entrepreneurs like Anthony Payton, founder of Nashua Digital. Payton, a partner of and a contributor to the the Granite State News Collaborative, is putting his initiative’s focus on local news and important issues, such as the opioid crisis, homelessness, local school projects and the contributions of Nashua area nonprofits to the health of the community. “There are too many untold stories that matter, but we are beginning to tell them,” Payton said.

Kennedy Airport ahead of Memorial Day weekend on May 28, 2021, in New York City. A British man flew from London’s Heathrow Airport to Kennedy Airport without a ticket or a passport on Christmas Eve, according to multiple reports. Craig Sturt, 46, was detained when he landed in New York and shipped back to the U.K. on a charter flight, the Telegraph reported. Investigators believe Sturt, who is 6 feet tall, sneaked behind other passengers at a passport check and during boarding of the British Airways flight, according to the Telegraph. Heathrow officials insisted that Sturt must have undergone security screening, Sky News reported. However, they provided no explanation for how he cleared security and customs checks without any documents. “All people who go airside are subject to security screening, including the individual involved in this case,” a spokesperson told the outlet. Sturt slipped onto a Boeing 787 Dreamliner at Heathrow’s Terminal 5 without a ticket, authorities told Sky News. Evidently, security at Kennedy Airport was tighter, as Sturt was apprehended when attempting to clear customs without documentation. U.S. authorities put Sturt on a plane back to the U.K. on Christmas Day, and he was detained upon arrival, Sky News reported. He was charged with fraud and Aviation Security Act offenses. Sturt was due in court on Jan. 25, but he never showed up, according to Sky News. A warrant was issued for his arrest and he remains on the run. “We continue to work with all our partners to review and enhance the already robust security measures in place which are kept under constant review by the wider security partnership,” London police told Sky News.

My day job is as a high school art teacher. I teach advanced placement, honors, drawing, painting and jewelry. As an artist [coledahar.com] I have a practice where I create wearable sculptures and paint women wearing them as historical and mythological figures that are reimagined through a feminist lens. How long have you had this job? I’ve been an artist pretty much all my life; an art teacher, I’ve been doing that for about 25 years. I’ve taught 3-year-olds and my oldest student was 96 years old. What led you to this career field and your current job? I graduated from art school in the ’90s with a fashion degree and I found out quickly that I really wasn’t crazy about that field. I bopped around for a little while and a friend offered me a job teaching and I found I loved it, everything about it. At the same time I promised myself that if I was going to go back to school and get a teaching degree, that I would always maintain an art practice. I think that’s very valuable for students to see, that a teacher not only can talk the talk but walk the walk…. What kind of education or training did you need? As an artist, I have a BFA, a bachelor of fine arts in apparel design, an MFA in drawing and painting, and I have an MAT, a master of arts in teaching, for my teaching license. There’s been a lot of training. I also make it a point to seek out artists that I want to learn from, teaching artists as well. I study under different masters, both jewelry and painting. What is your typical at-work uniform or attire? Generally things that I can put through the laundry, because art is a messy business. What is the most challenging thing about your work, and how do you deal with it? Time and having enough of it. I wish that we had 30-hour days so I could really get into things. It’s a balance having those two careers … trying to devote enough time to my own practice… What do you wish you had known at the beginning of your career? Basically, how to network within the arts community, how to find a group of artists to run critiques with…. I didn’t know how much I didn’t know until I stumbled upon it, so I try to give my students a heads up… What do you wish other people knew about your job? That it is highly rewarding but it is a lot of work. You work really hard and then when the opportunity comes around you’re able to take advantage of that opportunity…. What was your first job? I started busing tables for my grandmother’s restaurant when I was 12 years old. Before that I babysat. What is the best piece of work-related advice you’ve ever received? Don’t wait for inspiration to come to you. … If you’re unsure of starting a piece, work in your sketchbook. If you’re stuck on one, you can move to the next. It’s important to try to create every day. —Zachary Lewis Five favoritesFavorite book: I am a sucker for the original Grimm’s Fairy Tales.Favorite movie: Pan’s LabyrinthFavorite music: It’s usually like indie, goth, a little bit of swing.Favorite food: If I’m going out, I’d have to say I love Vietnamese food.Favorite thing about NH: You can be immersed in nature one part of the day and in a really urban setting the next.

Ron DeSantis speaks at a Contractors of America conference, Wednesday, Jan. 10, 2024 in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP Photo) NEW YORK (AP) — At this moment in the 2024 election cycle, complaining about Fox News — even if for different reasons — may be what unites Donald Trump, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis the most. At conservative America’s favorite news source, the Republican nomination process is essentially over and has been for awhile, leaving DeSantis and Haley annoyed at perceived favoritism to Trump. Hardly grateful, the former president regularly tears into Fox for what he sees as disloyalty, even ripping his former White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, now a Fox contributor. The discontent illustrates the ongoing importance of Fox News as an agenda-setter that frequently drives, and not simply reflects, Republican politics. No one can get to the top of the GOP’s hill without it. It’s also a testament to Fox’s power and influence, said Brian Stelter, media critic and author of two books about Fox News. In a “Fox & Friends” appearance, Haley suggested her questioners seemed eager to “coronate” Trump. Shortly before DeSantis ended his own campaign, he said that conservative media outlets like Fox are afraid to challenge the ex-president for fear of losing their audience. The past few months were a hard fall for DeSantis, once the beneficiary of so much attention that the Florida governor signed bills for the network’s cameras. He’s made 47 appearances on Fox since last September. Haley had 45 appearances in that time, and Trump six. “I think they were ready to move on from Trump, but the base of the party was not,” said Erick Erickson, whose conservative talk show airs on 45 stations across the country. “At the end of the day, these are their viewers and they don’t want to alienate them.” LONGTIME COMPLAINTS FROM DESANTIS The DeSantis campaign was upset about Fox’s town hall with Trump before the Iowa caucuses, when anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum received criticism for treating their subject gently. Trump had demanded — and received — a 9 p.m. Eastern time slot on Fox for a Jan. 10 town hall to blunt the impact of DeSantis and Haley, appearing in their only one-on-one debate the same time on CNN. Fox held separate pre-Iowa town halls for DeSantis and Haley, but at 6 p.m. before prime time. The DeSantis team felt Trump received little pushback from Fox when he decided to skip debates. They were angry that surrogates for the former president showed up at post-debate “spin rooms” even with the candidate absent, said a person close to the campaign who spoke candidly on condition of anonymity. Frustration boiled over when DeSantis’ campaign manager, James Uthmeier, felt that a Fox graphic didn’t show the extent of the candidate’s appearances in Iowa. “Fox has turned into full-blown Trump TV,” Uthmeier wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Fox did not make an executive available for an interview for this story. But a representative said that Trump surrogates were on scene post-debate because they had been booked for appearances by other networks. The 6 p.m. town halls weren’t as much a disadvantage as it seemed, since they followed “The Five,” Fox’s most-watched show. On Jan. 16, the day after the Iowa caucus, Fox’s Laura Ingraham urged both DeSantis and Haley to clear the field for Trump. “If she drops out today, if she came to terms with the fact that the GOP is a populist party, if she started vigorously campaigning for Trump, she could perhaps rebuild some of the trust that she’s lost with the GOP base,” Ingraham said. During her testy “Fox & Friends” appearance on the morning of the New Hampshire primary, Haley rebuffed host Brian Kilmeade when he asked what would constitute a strong showing for her that day. Asked by Ainsley Earhardt if she would withdraw if she lost New Hampshire, Haley said she would not. Kilmeade later repeated the same question. “I don’t care how much y’all want to coronate Donald Trump,” Haley said. “At the end of the day, that’s not what America wants. America wants a choice.” Kilmeade told her, “I really wonder why you think we’re the enemy.” One possibility: she had watched Trump give Kilmeade a tour of his plane earlier in New Hampshire. “You look like you’re in fightin’ shape,” Kilmeade said as he greeted the former president. “How much weight did you lose?” “I get their annoyance,” Erickson said. “They’ve got a right to be annoyed by it, (with Fox) essentially pushing them to bow to a reality that they were not prepared to acknowledge.” A Fox spokeswoman noted that, in response to Kilmeade’s “enemy” comment, Haley said “because I’ve looked at the media,” implying a broader criticism. She and DeSantis aren’t staying away, though; both accepted invitations to appear on Fox after making their criticisms. During an interview with New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Haley surrogate, Fox’s Harris Faulkner pushed back when Sununu questioned whether Trump’s age had affected his cognitive abilities — a frequent Fox topic when President Joe Biden is the subject. “The guy is nearly 80 years old,” Sununu said. “He’s 77,” Faulkner replied. “Yes, that’s nearly 80,” Sununu said. “We’ll do the math later.” Faulkner admonished Sununu for calling Trump a coward for not debating. “No name calling,” she said. “We don’t do name calling.” NEW ELECTION, SAME FOX MANAGEMENT This is the first presidential campaign since the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit against the network for spreading lies in its post-2020 election coverage, which Fox settled for $787 million last year. Reams of internal documents released as part of that case showed how Fox executives and personalities greatly feared losing Trump fans in their audience by telling them things they didn’t want to hear. The same management is in place now. Last week, a half hour after a New York jury ordered Trump to pay writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her, Fox’s “The Five” didn’t mention the news. The same hour, MSNBC talked of nothing else. The New York Times put the verdict on its front page Saturday, although not as the lead story. Meanwhile, Trump has maintained a steady stream of invective about Fox on his Truth Social website. His attack on his former press secretary came after she noted on Fox that Biden had a fairly good night in New Hampshire and that Trump should turn his attention to the general election. “I don’t need any advice from RINO Kayleigh McEnany on Fox,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, referencing the conservative slur Republican in Name Only. “Just had a GIANT victory … and she’s telling me what I could do better.” Trump frequently targets “Fox & Friends” host Steve Doocy for the host’s occasional fact checks. “Whatever happened to this guy???” Trump wrote. “Hard to believe how one-sided Fox is,” Trump wrote in one post. “What a difference from past … No wonder the Republican base no longer cares about them.” Fox had no comment on Trump’s posts. “The key for Fox is, are they going to silence the voices that have raised some concerns and skepticism, which they haven’t done so far, and credit to them for doing that,” Erickson said. “Trump is trying to bully and cajole and get people to fall in line so they don’t utter anything critical.” Join thousands already receiving our daily newsletter.

It was a simple process. I made a request for a public record or data, the government agency provided the information, and the public understood more about their community. Unfortunately, this process goes under attack Thursday when the New Hampshire House is expected to take up House Bill 1002, “An act relative to fees for records under the Right-to-Know law.” It’s a dangerous proposal that is strongly opposed by the ACLU, New England First Amendment Coalition, local newsrooms and many other bipartisan advocates for open government. It must be defeated. The bill allows a government agency to charge up to $25 an hour for any retrieval costs associated with a public records request that exceeds 10 hours. If it becomes law, HB 1002 will prove costly to journalists and news media, which are hardly rolling in wealth these days. Article continues after... Cross|Word Flipart Typeshift SpellTower Really Bad Chess Reporters will reduce their requests, either by number or breadth. Editors will question whether the reporter should file a request in the first place. And stories won’t get written. Here, for example, are topics of stories that I have researched with a public records request that probably took more than 10 hours of an official’s time: ■ Nurse practitioners and physician assistants prescribe opioids more than physicians, at least at the beginning of the opioid epidemic. ■ Nuclear contaminated material is buried beneath a South Willow Street shopping center that used to be the site of a former light bulb factory. ■ Several violent people were able to buy guns in New Hampshire because New Hampshire State Police missed a deadline to determine whether the gun sale was legal. ■ Details of Manchester police internal affairs investigations into two police officers accused of making racist comments. I did not file these requests needlessly. I did so because the records would provide clear, unfiltered information about an important topic. Sometimes, the government agency would fight me and the New Hampshire Union Leader in court, arguing that my request overstepped legal boundaries. More often, they complied and within a few weeks we received the material and ran articles based upon the outcome. But I can imagine what will happen when the prospect for revenue generation enters this relationship. Every document, every line of data will have to be reviewed, probably twice. Accountants and lawyers will get involved. Newspapers will have to pay twice for redactions – then the bureaucrat blacks it out, and then for a lawyer to fight it in court. And the public will know less. That’s bad for New Hampshire, bad for democracy. Mark Hayward worked as a reporter in New Hampshire from 1991 to this past summer, when he retired from the New Hampshire Union Leader. He currently serves on NEFAC’s New Hampshire Advisory Committee. 05-31-2024 11:28 AM 05-31-2024 11:27 AM 05-31-2024 11:27 AM 05-31-2024 11:27 AM Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy About Us Accessibility Newsroom • news@ledgertranscript.com Newsletters • Sign up here Social Media • Facebook • Twitter • Youtube • Instagram Newsletters • Sign up here Social Media • Facebook • Twitter • Youtube • Instagram By using this site, you agree with our use of cookies to personalize your experience, measure ads and monitor how our site works to improve it for our users Copyright © 2016 to 2024 by Monadnock Ledger-Transcript.
