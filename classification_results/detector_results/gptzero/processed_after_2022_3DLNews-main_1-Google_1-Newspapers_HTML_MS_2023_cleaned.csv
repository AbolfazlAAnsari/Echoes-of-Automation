free content COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — President Joe Biden quipped that he got “sandbagged” Thursday after he tripped and fell — but was uninjured — while onstage at the U.S. Air Force Academy graduation. Biden had been greeting the graduates in Colorado Springs, Colorado, at the front of the stage with salutes and handshakes, and turned to jog back toward his seat when he fell. He was helped up by an Air Force officer as well as two members of his U.S. Secret Service detail. Onlookers, including some members of the official delegation onstage, watched in concern before Biden, who at age 80 is the oldest president in U.S. history, returned to his seat to view the end of the ceremony. “I got sandbagged,” the president told reporters with a smile when he arrived back at the White House on Thursday evening before pretending to jog into the residence. Two small black sandbags had been onstage supporting the teleprompter used by Biden and other speakers at the graduation. “He’s fine,” White House communications director Ben LaBolt tweeted after the incident. “There was a sandbag on stage while he was shaking hands.” Biden has been dogged by questions about his age and his fitness to serve, and his missteps have become fodder for political rivals as he campaigns for a second term in 2024. He has stumbled before going up the stairs and onto Air Force One and he once got caught up in his bike pedals while stopping to talk to reporters near his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Biden’s personal doctor said after the president’s most recent physical exam in February that Biden “remains a healthy, vigorous 80-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.” Dr. Kevin O’Connor also documented the president's stiffened gait, which O'Connor said was the result of spinal arthritis, a previously broken foot and neuropathy in the Biden's feet. Biden is far from the first national political figure to stumble in public. President Gerald Ford fell down while walking off Air Force One in 1975. GOP Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the GOP presidential nominee at the time, fell off the stage at a campaign rally in 1996. President Barack Obama tripped walking up the stairs to a stage at a 2012 event. “I was so fired up, I missed a stair” he told the crowd. President Donald Trump's gingerly walk down a ramp at the 2020 West Point commencement also sparked concerns about his health. Trump, 76, was campaigning in Iowa when he heard about Biden's stumble and alluded to his own episode. “He actually fell down? Well I hope he wasn’t hurt,” Trump said after an audience member told him about what had happened to Biden. “The whole thing is crazy. You gotta be careful about that ... 'cause you don’t want that, even if you have to tiptoe down a ramp.” The audience laughed as Trump recounted slowly inching his way down what he said had been a slippery ramp at the U.S. Military Academy graduation. “If he fell, it’s too bad,” the former president said. “We gotta just get this thing back on track. That’s a bad place to fall when you’re making, I think it was the Air Force Academy, right? That’s not inspiring.” Meanwhile, GOP presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis used the opportunity to take a political shot at Biden while at a campaign event in New Hampshire. “We hope and wish Joe Biden a swift recovery from any injuries he may have sustained,” he said, “but we also wish the United States of America a swift recovery from the injuries it has sustained because of Joe Biden and his policies.” Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

November 22, 2023 By Staff Report By Wyatt Emmerich The Northside Sun It’s Thanksgiving 2023 and we’ve never had so much to be thankful for. The world is in the best shape it’s ever been. So is our great country and our wonderful state. The reason we think times are so bad is because of the nature of the Internet and all sorts of digital communications. Never before has inflammatory bad news been delivered so quickly in such volume to so many. The very technology that is making the greatest economic advances in the history of our world is making us think the sky is falling. It is up to us to see through this haze of fog and count our blessings. The two biggest measures of human progress are the reduction of poverty and human life expectancy. Over the last 30 years, world poverty — defined by living on less than a dollar per day — is down from 30 percent to 10 percent of the world’s people. Never before in human history have we made such gains. This year world life expectancy, according to the United Nations, is 73.16 compared to 64.56 thirty years ago. The U. S. life expectancy is 76.1. The U.S. is the richest country in the world. So the entire world life expectancy is just three years less than the life expectancy of the richest country in the world. That is nothing short of amazing. Some people may not care about the rest of the world. No worries. The United States is booming. Per capita income was $51,784 in 2012. By 2022 it was $76,399, adjusted for inflation. That’s a 47 percent increase in just one decade, the most rapid increase in U. S. history. In Mississippi, 2012 per capita income was $33,441. Ten years later it was $46,370. That’s a 39 percent increase in per capita income in one decade, adjusted for inflation. That’s enormous economic progress, but it doesn’t capture the fact that what we buy is so much better than what we bought 10 years ago. A smartphone today is 100 times better than a smartphone 10 years ago, so the economic progress, impressive though it is in raw dollars, doesn’t even begin to reflect the real increase in value of what we buy and use. It would have cost a billion dollars 20 years ago to buy a smartphone like the ones we all have today. In that sense, we are all billionaires. Every night, the average Mississippian goes to bed in conditions far better than the King of England had 400 years ago. We have orthopedic mattresses, fine sheets and linens, air conditioning to get the room temperature just perfect, soft pillows and maybe a TV on the wall of our bedroom. Think about something as simple as sporting events. A 50-inch LED widescreen TV costs about $500 — easily affordable by an average Mississippi family. Most homes have multiple screens with which to watch football games with perfect camera angles, play-by-play analysis and the ability to watch as many games as you want by flipping channels (or even have four games displayed simultaneously on your screen.) Think about food. Most of human history, we have struggled to fill our bellies. Now we have to take drugs to repress our appetite. Food is everywhere and it’s absolutely delicious. You can walk in a simple quick stop gas station and buy mouth watering ribs, delicious boiled peanuts and a thousand other delicious items. Our fast food may not be healthy, but it’s delicious. Five hundred years ago, starving peasants were hanged for catching a wild rabbit on a noble’s property. Imagine what that peasant would think about an easily affordable bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Man does not live by bread alone. In Mississippi we have it better than anywhere in the world because all these material blessings are superseded by our faith. We are some of the most spiritual people in the world, with churches on every block! Now that is something for which to be thankful. What is your opinion of Day Light Saving Time View Results'}]"

family, as it is for many. My Dad especially liked Christmas. I believe he loved seeing the family all together on Christmas Day, the special time of the year of giving. My Dad owned several newspapers and always liked to have the famous editorial, “Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus,” written by Francis Pharcellus Church and first published in the New York newspaper The Sun on September 21, 1897. In 1897, Virginia wrote the newspaper editor to ask if there was a Santa Claus because The Sun, according to her father, Phillip O’Hanlon, was the most reliable newspaper in New York City. Virginia had In her letter, Virginia wrote that her father had told her, “If you see it in The Sun it’s so.” O’Hanlon said the newspaper may be too busy to respond but to go ahead and write one and not be disappointed if she did not get a response. It became one of the most reprinted newspaper editorials in English, and it has been made into a movie, TV show, and musical and translated into more than 20 languages. It was one of my Dad’s favorites in his newspaper’s Christmas special edition, filled with Dear Santa letters from local children. It seemed appropriate to republish the editorial in today’s edition. I hope you enjoy Virginia’s letter to the Editor, the response, and The South Reporter’s Christmas special edition. Yes Virginia, There Is A Santa Claus By Francis P. Church Dear Editor, I am 8 years old. Some of my little friends say that there is no Santa Claus. Papa says, “If you see it in the Sun, it is so.” Please tell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus? Virginia, Your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except what they see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men’s or children’s, are little. In this great universe of ours, man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect, as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge. Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and give to our life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! How dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished. Not believe in Santa Claus? You might as well not believe in fairies! You might get your Papa to hire men to watch all the chimneys on Christmas Eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but that’s no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders that are unseen and unseeable in the world. You tear apart the baby’s rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, or even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived, could tear apart. Only faith, fancy, poetry, love, and romance can push aside that curtain and view and picture the supernatural beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world, there is nothing else as real and abiding. No Santa Claus? Thank God he lives and he lives forever. A thousand years from now, maybe ten times 10,000 years from now, he will continue to make glad the hearts of children. Click here to read The South Reporter P.O.

Photo courtesy Wikimedia Commons. Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard, third headmaster of the University of Mississippi but the first one to be titled chancellor, helped the university survive one of the South’s most devastating attacks: Gen. William Sherman’s March to the Sea during the Civil War. While teaching at Louisiana Seminary, Barnard made a friend whose name may sound familiar – William Tecumseh Sherman – who would later become a general in the Union Army known for burning his way across the South.. Junior history major Samantha Case, an ambassador for the UM Department of History, is familiar with the story of collaboration between Sherman and Barnard. “I think the friendship they formed there (in seminary) did help the university. Just because both universities are in the South,” Case said. “I also think that when Sherman walked through the university, he saw Barnard Observatory and connected it to his old friend.” “The Ole Miss Experience,” a book edited by Natasha Jeter that is frequently used as an educational tool in freshman and transfer experience classes, quotes Sherman while troops under his command were making their way through the South and stopped at the university. “When I rode through the grounds of the college, I thought of you (Barnard) … and … thought I saw traces of your life, of which I remember you spoke,” Sherman said. Following this reflection, Sherman gave an order to the Union soldiers led by Gen. A.J. “Whiskey” Smith to spare the university’s campus because of his friendship with Barnard. “One of the buildings that was spared was the new observatory, which was to house, at the time, the world’s largest telescope. Today it is Barnard Observatory,” the catalogue said. William Tecumseh Sherman. Photo courtesy of Wikimedia Commons. According to the book “Historical Catalogue of the University of Mississippi 1849-1909,” which was compiled by UM, the university would also be saved by the soldiers occupying it. “During the Civil War, the buildings of the university were occupied sometimes by Confederate and sometimes by federal soldiery,” the catalogue said. The catalog describes how federal soldiers in particular spared the university. The text reveals that Gen. Sherman was not the only leader for the Union vying for the university’s safety. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant also formed a friendship with Barnard, and that relationship, too, helped secure the university’s safety. “When the university’s buildings were occupied by federal soldiery the personal influence of the late Professors Barnard, Boynton and others who were in the North secured the interest of Gen. Grant in the protection of the apparatus and buildings belonging to the institution,” the catalogue said. Having the two most powerful men from the North taking an interest in the well being of UM and helping to preserve the campus is the largest reason the campus was spared from destruction during the Civil War. Gen. Sherman’s goal during his march was to obliterate the South’s way to support itself by burning all of the fields and buildings. “The Ole Miss Experience” book corroborates what Case said.

plenty of legitimate discussions to be had regarding the imposition of the death penalty in Mississippi. Mississippi currently has 35 inmates on Death Row, according to Mississippi Department of Corrections data – 34 men and one woman. National debates and disputes over execution methods in recent years effectively brought executions to a halt even in the 27 states like Mississippi that authorize capital punishment for particularly heinous crimes. Those debates have led several states, including Mississippi, Alabama, and Oklahoma, to devise new strategies to get around those chemical debate obstacles. All three states authorized nitrogen hypoxia as a means of execution. Nitrogen hypoxia is a form of suffocation. The Wall Street Journal notes that “the 2018 Alabama law approving this method describes it as ‘nitrogen hypoxia,’ but that’s not quite right. Hypoxia means reduction of oxygen levels in the blood. Breathing pure nitrogen induces anoxia, a total depletion of blood oxygen.” The nitrogen method has yet to be utilized, but Alabama officials are asking their state Supreme Court to clear the way to do so. That ruling, and the subsequent actual use of it in Alabama, will impact methodologies across the country in death penalty states. Mississippi’s law passed in 2022 and gives the Miss. Department of Corrections even stronger latitude in making means of execution decisions. MDOC officials can now choose between lethal injection, nitrogen hypoxia (anoxia), firing squad, or electrocution as the means by which state prisoners are put to death. Since 1976, Mississippi has executed 23 prisoners. All were male, 17 were white, and 6 were black. Four were executed in the gas chamber. The remaining 19 were executed by lethal injection. Mississippi’s most recent execution was that of Thomas Edwin Loden Jr., a 58-year-old ex-Marine recruiter, who was executed for the Itawamba County murder of Leesa Marie Gray, 16. Loden died by lethal injection. The number of Death Row inmates in Mississippi has declined over the last 20 years in that there are about 40 percent fewer inmates awaiting execution. The execution hiatuses fueled by the lethal injection chemical battles ground the process to a near halt and during those hiatuses, inmates died of natural causes or won legal appeals. But one inmate, James Billiot, has been on Death Row since his Dec. 1982 conviction for the Thanksgiving Day, 1981, murder of his mother, stepfather and 14-year-old stepsister. The trio was beaten to death with an eight-pound sledgehammer. Still on Mississippi’s Death Row are inmates Anthony Carr, 55, and Robert Simon Jr., 57, who were convicted and sentenced to death for the Feb. 2, 1990, murders of the Carl “Bubba” Parker family at their Walnut community home on Hwy. 322 southwest of Lambert in Quitman County. The family left the Riverside Baptist Church Bible study class at about 9 p.m. to return to their home. Parker, 58; his wife Bobbie Jo, 45; daughter Charlotte Jo, 9; and son Gregory, 12, were active in the church where Bobbie Jo served as the church secretary and pianist. Murder was the kindest thing that happened to this innocent family during a senseless rampage of torture, assault, arson and robbery. There are plenty of legitimate discussions to be had regarding the imposition of the death penalty in Mississippi. What about the morality of the death penalty? What about disparities in who receives the death penalty based on race or economic status? What about Mississippi’s failures to fund a credible, working indigent defense and post-conviction appeal process? Mississippi adopted the notion of giving MDOC officials discretion over execution methods as a direct response to roadblocks raised nationally by death penalty opponents.

currently in standard theme You are currently in flex theme free content PARIS (AP) — An assessment by French military intelligence indicates the most likely cause of the deadly explosion at Gaza City’s al-Ahli hospital was a Palestinian rocket that carried an explosive charge of about 5 kilograms (11 pounds) and possibly misfired, a senior French military official said Friday. Several rockets in the arsenal of the Palestinian militant group Hamas carry explosive charges of about that weight, including an Iranian-made rocket and another that is Palestinian-made, the intelligence official said. None of their intelligence pointed to an Israeli strike, the official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, but was cleared to discuss the assessment by President Emmanuel Macron in what was described as an attempt to be transparent about the French intelligence findings. The assessment was based on classified information, satellite imagery, intelligence shared by other countries and open-source information, the official said. The size of the blast crater in a courtyard of the hospital was assessed by French military intelligence to be about 1 meter (39 inches) long, 75 centimeters (29 1/2 inches) across and about 30 to 40 centimeters (12 to 16 inches) deep. That is consistent with an explosive charge of about 5 kilograms, the official said. The official said the hole appeared to be slightly oriented on a south to north axis, suggesting a projectile that hit at an oblique angle on a south to north trajectory. Officials in Hamas-ruled Gaza quickly blamed an Israeli airstrike for the explosion at the hospital Tuesday. Israel denied it was involved and released live video, audio and other evidence it said showed the blast was caused by a rocket misfired by Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group. Islamic Jihad denied responsibility. The death toll remains in dispute. Within just over an hour of the blast, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said 500 had died. It then revised that number slightly to 471 on Wednesday, without giving details of the dead. The Israeli military told reporters that number was inflated. While also cautioning that “I have no certitude,” the French military intelligence official said: ""We don’t see at all that a rocket that size could have produced 471 dead. It is not possible.” A United States intelligency report estimated that somewhere between 100 and 300 Palestinians were likely killed. Even in Gaza there were conflicting estimates of the dead. Al-Ahli Hospital officials said only that the toll was in the hundreds, without giving a firm number. The general director of Gaza’s largest hospital, Shifa, Mohammed Abu Selmia, said he thought the toll was closer to 250, based on the casualties he saw streaming into the triage center. Two witnesses said they thought the toll was in the dozens, not the hundreds. All officials in Gaza have said the blast left body parts strewn everywhere, complicating the task of counting the dead. ___ Associated Press writer Isabel DeBre contributed to this report.

Monroe County correctional officer Josh Randall was awarded this year's M17 Scholarship, which honors the late Dylan Pickle, who is pictured in a frame at the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. Monroe County Sheriff's Office correctional officer Josh Randall understands there's a process to achieve his goal of making the department's special operations group (SOG). First, he has to work patrol when a spot comes open, make the SWAT team when there's an availability and finally have a unanimous vote from its members to make SOG. Being awarded the annual M17 Scholarship will help provide a foundation towards those goals by paying for his time at the Mississippi Delta Community College Law Enforcement Training Academy.

Nov. 4, 2023. (AP Photo/Thomas Graning)AP By CHRIS BURROWS Associated Press OXFORD, Miss. (AP) — Quinshon Judkins ran for three touchdowns, including the game-winner from a yard out with 1:40 remaining, and No. 11 Mississippi rallied to defeat Texas A&M 38-35 on Saturday. Ole Miss (8-1, 5-1 SEC, No. 10 CFP) preserved the win on the final play as Zxavian Harris tipped Randy Bond’s 47-yard field-goal attempt for the Aggies (5-4, 3-3). The Rebels remained in second place in the SEC West race with their fifth consecutive win. Judkins, who had 102 yards rushing on 23 carries, capped a nine-play, 75-yard drive to give the Rebels the decisive margin. Jaxson Dart was 24 of 33 for 387 yards and two touchdowns. Tre Harris caught 11 passes for for 213 yards, including an 11-yard TD. Max Johnson, 31 of 42 passing for 305 yards, rallied the Aggies from a 31-21 fourth-quarter deficit, scoring on a 1-yard run for a 35-31 lead with 4:34 left. He also threw a 28-yard TD pass to Jake Johnson but had a pass intercepted in the end zone. The Rebels got scoring runs of 9 and 6 yards from Judkins to build a 20-14 halftime lead. Jahdae Walker led Texas A&M with eight receptions for 100 yards and Amari Daniels had 70 yards on 12 rushes with a 1-yard touchdown. A&M’s Le’Veon Moss left with an injury in the second half after running nine times for 52 yards and a touchdown. Texas A&M, trailing 14-0 midway, kept the game close thanks to a big play on special teams. After Ole Miss had a 12-yard touchdown run erased by a holding penalty, Shemar Turner blocked Jacoby Mathews’ 41-yard field goal attempt and returned it for a 75-yard touchdown to make it 14-7. Texas A&M: The road losing streak extended to nine games and the Aggies are 0-4 against ranked teams. The Aggies still have to play at No. 13 LSU but otherwise have a manageable schedule and could still win eight games. Mississippi: This marked the fourth time the Rebels overcame a second-half deficit to win. The No. 11 Rebels have spent most of the season as the third-highest ranked among six SEC teams in the Top 25. They have a chance to move up depending on how teams ahead of them fare. Texas A&M: The Aggies host Mississippi State next Saturday to open a two-game homestand. Mississippi: The Rebels visit No. 1 Georgia on Saturday.

Born and raised in Decatur, Mississippi, Gaines was big into music in his youth. He was a percussionist in the Newton County High School band and later at East Central Community College, and he also sang and played bass guitar. So it wasn’t much of a stretch that he chose to pursue a career in the entertainment business. After serving in the United States Marine Corps and Air National Guard, Gaines began auditioning for roles and found work on television shows like “NCIS: New Orleans” and supporting parts in films like “5,000 Blankets.” “Growing up, I was more involved in music,” Gaines said in a telephone interview. “My wife and I saw this thing on the news about a film being produced. I said, you know what? I’ve always been involved in the arts. So I went and auditioned and I got a role in a film and I just loved it.” In the beginning, Gaines mostly appeared in the background. But being on a set allowed him to take it all in and he watched as the actors spoke their lines in a scene, and studied how the director worked, and what the different members of the production crew did. From there, as he met more and more people in the entertainment business, it allowed him to try out for bigger parts. “I did background work just to get my foot in the door,” Gaines said. “But then as I started learning the business, I started being cast in bigger productions.” Watching actors like Scott Bakula on “NCIS: New Orleans” and just being on a set was a dream come true for the aspiring actor. He knew that was what he wanted to do. “NCIS: New Orleans kind of got me hooked,” Gaines said. “I would see the cast members coming and going from their trailers. That was something I will never forget. It was great just being right there on the set with him. It gave me a real feel for what acting is about. It laid the groundwork for me to get started in this business.” Gaines also appeared in a handful of commercials and did some voice work, but his big break came in 2019 when he was cast on the prime-time ABC television show “What Would You Do?” The hidden camera show hosted by John Quinones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave in different situations and whether they take action, or just walk by and mind their own business. “That was huge for me,” Gaines said. “I tried out and wound up booking one of the lead spots. I came back for a few more episodes of that. That show got millions of views. It’s a popular show and was a real blessing to be a part of. Any time that I am cast, I am just so thankful. But that just set the stage for what was to come. I started moving around from television to films.” Gaines landed the biggest role of his career to date as a recurring character on the ABC production of “Women of the Movement.” The civil rights era historical drama portrays the efforts of Emmett Till’s mother to get justice for her murdered son, and was filmed in Sumner, Mississippi in Tallahatchie County, where the real events took place in 1955. Gaines played Johnny Whitten, a member of the defense team and appeared in four of the six episodes. “That was such a huge production,” Gaines said. “It was huge for ABC. It was shot in Mississippi in Sumner where the actual trial happened. They completely remodeled the town to look as it did back then. The cast was from all over and it was really neat to be a part of. It was just like a big family. It was such a special project and I was really blessed to be cast.” The strike by the Screen Actors Guild, of which he is a member, shut down filming on most productions and slowed things down for him career-wise for a bit, but now that filming has resumed again, Gaines said he is reading over a few scripts now looking for his next project. “I am looking forward to 2024 and seeing what projects come my way,” Gaines said. “I have been in talks with some producers already. In this business, you just have to keep moving forward.” In the meantime, Gaines and his family are in the process of moving to DeSoto County which they plan to call home. Gaines said he loves being close to Memphis and Nashville. “It’s great to be here in DeSoto County,” Gaines said. “We heard a lot about the area and we visited several times and decided to settle down here. We are still in the process of moving, but we are looking forward to settling in. Everybody has been so welcoming.” And with so many film and television projects being filmed in the southeast in cities like Atlanta and New Orleans, Gaines said being based in north Mississippi will allow him to be able to travel for film and television roles while staying close to his southern roots. “That’s the benefit of films today,” Gaines said. “Certainly a lot of films are still out in Hollywood, but Atlanta is a big hub now. So there is a lot of work in the South that you can do. You may have to jump states for some things, but you can stay in the southeast for projects if you want. You also have to be a little versatile to travel, which I have done.” Gaines said he enjoys being able to work in both film and television and wouldn’t rule out accepting a role in a television series if it was the right part. Being a military veteran, Gaines can credibly pull off being a tough guy. But he also enjoys playing dramatic roles like the one he landed in “Women of the Movement,” and would love to do more of those. “My military background does set me up for things such as characters who are in law enforcement or the military,” Gaines said. “But I like exploring all kinds of roles. I had such a good run on that limited series. That was just awesome to be a part of. So depending on the role and the character, if something like that pops up in the future - and I hope it does - that is definitely something I would consider.” And being from Mississippi, Gaines also doesn’t have to fake a southern accent if a production calls for a southerner with a drawl. “Yeah, I can’t deny my accent,” Gaines said. “So I think anything that requires that authentic southern accent, I think I can nail that. I don’t have to fake that. That’s something I am already comfortable with.” Gaines said he has made a lot of friends in the entertainment business and considers it a blessing to be cast. “I am just so thankful to have been a part of all of these projects,” Gaines said. “I have met so many talented actors and directors and have a lot of good friends now who are very creative and work in the industry. I am just really blessed to be a part of it. I wouldn’t change a thing. It’s been pretty awesome.” Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language.

Not like I love my family, or like I love Jesus, but I really do have a strong affection for dogs.A few months ago, I came home from teaching and was welcomed by an unfamiliar, and rather unpleasant, smell in the convent. Entering our large dining room, I noticed the puppy crate had been set up, and indeed was being used! Little Charlie was about 5 months old and it was love at first sight. Although he really did stink.Earlier that morning, my religious community was serving over 400 families at our weekly food pantry when – seemingly out of nowhere – Charlie had shown up – soaking wet, muddy and full of friendly energy. Sister Kate noticed that this rather large Siberian Husky puppy was causing distress among our pantry guests and quickly put him on a leash.When I met him some hours later, Charlie had already been given the first of several (very necessary) baths and was making himself at home. He was all cuddles and kisses. Everyone was his friend, and he made sure you knew you were loved. Through the neighborhood grapevine we learned that Charlie had been abandoned by his owners. Caring for man’s best friend is not easy: It takes time, attention and resources. The people who had originally owned Charlies must have thought, “Surely the nuns will take care of him.” And we did.But could we become his forever home?In religious life (and really all Christian life), a great virtue to cultivate is detachment. Unfortunately for me, that virtue wasn’t kicking in (nor was I really attempting to foster it) when it came to Charlie. All I wanted was to keep him. But with three German Shepherds, our little Franciscan community already had our hands full, and for all of his positive character traits, there was not one drop of guard dog in Charlie. At the time we had a small renovation project going on in the convent, and not one “stranger” (construction worker) who entered was bereft of a kiss from him.Six days after he came to us, we were able to locate a proper Husky rescue, and a few weeks after that, we received the good news that Charlie had been adopted – he had found his forever home.If you and I are honest, we really are looking for the same thing as Charlie, aren’t we? Don’t we have a deep, innate desire for home? And no matter how good it can get this side of heaven, that desire is just never fully satisfied.During my theology classes, I was blessed to befriend Father Tom Norris, an Irish theologian and a visiting professor to Mundelein Seminary. He had a way of teaching – and storytelling – that could leave one not only stunned but speechless and immobile – as if he could open a wellspring of grace, and you couldn’t help but let yourself be lovingly soaked in the glory. One day, as he was describing the paschal mystery he stated: “Good Friday is when the ‘homeland’ enters exile so that the exiles may enter the ‘homeland.’”I was totally blown away; I began to realize in a new way that the paschal mystery wasn’t just something that happened 2,000 years ago.What happened on Good Friday and what was victoriously completed in the resurrection and ascension of Jesus is represented for us in the Eucharist at every Mass. In those moments of consecration – so timeless – we are invited with the priest to truly pray the Mass. In doing so, we enter into something that is real, and truer than anything this side of heaven.Charlie had to roam for a few months before he found “homeland,” but you and I don’t ever have to wait that long. The forever home we long for begins right here, right now, in every Eucharist.

For one Madison County woman, giving is a year-round thing she does for area homeless men, women, and children. It’s a ministry of giving and providing food, clothing shelter, and a hand up to those in need around Madison County. Sandy Reeder began helping in 2016. She started by making meals, boxing them up, and delivering them. The food led to a gateway of trust where she could provide more and perhaps the biggest gift of all, telling folks about Jesus. “We take items they need like shoes, blankets, socks and clothes, sleeping bags and tents. We go out looking for them and I have relationships with some and I know where they live,” Reeder said. “We just try to show them love.” The Lord’s Supper Homeless Ministry, a 503C non-profit, is always looking for help with donations of money, time and food and other items that the homeless need. The Cairo, Mississippi, native found her way to Madison County nearly a quarter century ago. Reeder works from home as an account manager for a company that produces interior signage for hotels. “I do the homeless ministry on Saturdays until the Lord allows me to retire from my regular job,” she said. The ministry came about after her first husband passed away a decade ago from cancer. “I’ve always lived my life with a protector – my middle sister and my first husband were both very protective. I went through a time where I was so, so fearful and wouldn’t leave the house. God’s Word has so many scriptures about ‘do not fear’ and about being our protector. Isaiah 41:10 became my own personal scripture. I’d lay in bed and say that over and over in my mind till I fell asleep. When I finally started believing that scripture, that God was my protector and I shouldn’t fear that he would help me and uphold me with his righteous right hand.” The verse states, “Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. For I am the LORD, your God, who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you.” Reeder didn’t realize that God was training her for a ministry. “There were trials and tests to see if I would trust him with my life and I passed some and failed others. I knew after a year and a half that there was something God wanted me to do. And I said, ‘just tell me and I’ll do it.’ But he didn’t,” she said. But after a shopping trip, she was at a stoplight when the vision came to her to buy a building and start cooking and helping the homeless. Reeder didn’t have the resources to do so and told the Lord and then the vision became clearer. “He told me to go buy the largest coolers I could find for the back of my truck. Prepare the meals at home and start that way,"" she said. “I was flooded with relief and prayed about what to feed them and how to find them.” She wrote down the directions she got and after three months, went out on a cold December day and found her first three homeless people to help. “What I love is the Lord grew it really slowly. And I can see why. I would have been overwhelmed. Started out there was three, then five, then seven, then ten and 15 and before COVID, I was feeding up to 60 people each Saturday,” she said. She also started a Bible Study on Wednesday nights outside the Eudora Welty Library in Jackson before the pandemic hit as well. With the pandemic in the rearview mirror, Reeder and her helpers continue to seek and help the homeless. “I tell folks it’s like finding Easter Eggs when we go out,” she said. “For me, it’s all about sharing the Gospel with them. If you don’t feed their stomachs, you can’t feed their souls. They are like family to me and it’s all about taking care of them and showing them the love of Christ and plant seeds wherever I can plant them.” She noted that “God has provided everything. For the longest time, I didn’t tell my family because I felt like they wouldn’t understand.” Then one Sunday in her Life Group she asked if there were any old blankets and coats and such to help those she was finding. Then there were blanket and coat drives that have the ministry stocked on items to give out. “I don’t solicit donations but I post on Facebook if folks are looking for a holiday mission and I list the specific needs. Other than that, I don’t solicit because God has been so faithful to provide – food and blankets and sleeping bags and whatever I’ve needed. He’s been so faithful. It’s not my ministry. It’s God’s. I figure whenever he wants me to have a building with a kitchen and showers, He’ll provide that. This is where He has me and I’m just trying to be obedient.” Reeder has had a lot of husbands and wives volunteer to help her along with youth groups who get their eyes opened to the problems of the real world. Reeder has a Facebook page, The Lords Supper Homeless Ministry in Madison, MS. “I want God to get all of the glory.” Matthew 25:37-40 New American Standard Bible states: “Then the righteous will answer Him, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You, or thirsty, and give You something to drink? And when did we see You a stranger, and invite You in, or naked, and clothe You? When did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’ The King will answer and say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me.’” Other items that may interest you Chef Song Zhenz has received many compliments since opening a new Chinese restaurant in Gluckstadt a month ago.

flex theme free content A top World Health Organization official described the hospital situation in Gaza as “catastrophic” on Monday, saying most are no longer functioning and what remains will likely be overwhelmed by thousands of births expected in the next month. The United Nations briefing came hours after a shell struck the second floor of a hospital in northern Gaza, killing 12 people, according to the Hamas-led Health Ministry and a medical worker. The ministry and the worker both blamed Israel, which denied shelling the hospital. Heavy fighting broke out around the Indonesian Hospital, which has housed thousands of patients and displaced people for weeks. The fighting came a day after the World Health Organization evacuated 31 premature babies from Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, the territory’s largest, where they were among more than 250 critically ill or wounded patients stranded there days after Israeli forces entered the compound. Israel says Hamas uses civilians and hospitals as shields, while critics say Israel’s siege and relentless aerial bombardment amount to collective punishment of the territory’s 2.3 million Palestinians after Hamas’ Oct. 7 rampage into southern Israel. More than 12,700 Palestinians — two-thirds of them women and minors — have been killed since the war began, according to Palestinian health authorities, who do not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. About 4,000 people are reported missing. Some 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, mostly during the Oct. 7 attack, and around 240 were taken captive by militants.

Udi Goren, whose cousin Tal Chaimi is in captivity in Gaza, was one of several family members of hostages who met with the war cabinet, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “What we’ve heard is that taking down Hamas and bringing the hostages (home) are ... equally important,” Goren told reporters after coming out of the meeting in Tel Aviv. “This is incredibly disappointing because ... we know that taking down Hamas, we keep hearing from them (it) is going to take months or years and it’s going to take a long time,” Goren said. Goren also said the war cabinet — a body set up immediately after the Hamas attack and made up of Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant, the Minister of Defense and former military chief turned politician, Benny Gantz — did not share any details about any possible deal to release the hostages. 200 EVACUATED FROM GAZA HOSPITAL GAZA CITY — About 200 people have been evacuated from a northern Gaza hospital that was caught up in fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants on Monday. Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesperson for Hamas’ Health Ministry, said the evacuees from Indonesian Hospital were taken to southern Gaza in a rescue effort coordinated by the United Nations and the International Committee for the Red Cross. Many of the injured evacuees are being treated at al-Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, he said. Between 400 and 500 more wounded people remain at Indonesian Hospital, al-Qudra said in an interview with Al-Jazeera. The evacuations came after 12 people were killed when a shell struck the second floor of the hospital, according to the Health Ministry and a medical worker at the hospital. Both blamed Israel, which denied shelling the hospital, saying its troops returned fire on militants who targeted them from inside the 3.5-acre compound. RED CROSS HEAD MEETS WITH HAMAS LEADER The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which helped arrange the release of four Israeli hostages held by Hamas, has met with the militant group’s supreme leader Ismail Haniyeh. Mirjana Spoljaric traveled Monday to Qatar and met with the Hamas leader as part of the ICRC’s efforts to ensure respect for international humanitarian law. ICRC has repeatedly called for the release of hostages and has been seeking access for its teams to visit hostages and deliver medication, as well as to help hostages to communicate with their families. Spoljaric has met with Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen and relatives of some hostages in recent weeks at ICRC’s Geneva headquarters. OFFICIAL: U.S. INTEL BACKS ISRAELI CLAIM ON HAMAS OPERATING AT SHIFA HOSPITAL WASHINGTON — White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Monday the United States has its own intelligence assessment that “corroborated” Israeli claims that Hamas was using the Shifa Hospital in Gaza as a “command and control node.” Hamas has denied claims that it\'s operating from inside the hospital or from tunnels beneath it. Kirby said the U.S. government doesn\'t have any intelligence as to whether Hamas is also using the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza, where thousands of patients and displaced people have been sheltering for weeks. On Monday, 12 people were killed when a shell struck the second floor of the hospital as Israeli forces battled militants around it. Israel denied shelling the hospital, saying its troops returned fire on militants who targeted them from inside the compound. Kirby said he did not have an update on negotiations to release hostages. But Kirby said that pauses in fighting would be needed for the release of hostages. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SAYS MOST GAZA HOSPITALS NO LONGER FUNCTIONING GENEVA — The World Health Organization warned Monday that health services in Gaza had suffered “catastrophic” damage, with most hospitals no longer functioning. “We now have 1.7 million people displaced so we have twice or three times the population (in the south of Gaza), using one third of the hospital beds in less than a third of the hospitals available,” Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, told a United Nations briefing, speaking from Geneva. “Even if tomorrow morning, this were to end in terms of a ceasefire, we still have a huge problem on our hands.” Ryan said the services in the territory were already unable to provide care for more complex medical cases – including care for most cancer and kidney dialysis patients – and would likely be overwhelmed by some 5,500 births expected in the next month. Plans by the Israeli military to push further south, he said, would worsen health conditions even further. “The hospital situation – the primary health care system situation – in Gaza is catastrophic and it is the worst you can imagine (in the) north,"" Ryan said. ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS MORE THAN 300 HAMAS ARRESTEES INTERROGATED JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said Monday it has interrogated over 300 members of Hamas and other militant groups arrested in Gaza during its ground invasion, revealing the locations of underground tunnels, warehouses, weapons, and Hamas’ use of civilian infrastructure. “Each and every interrogation leads to the release of new locations and the human intelligence that emerges from the Gaza Strip,” said a senior military official, speaking on condition of anonymity under army guidelines. Israel has said Hamas has built a vast underground command complex center below Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest and best-equipped hospital. Gaza health officials and Hamas deny it. SPAIN, BELGIUM LEADERS TO VISIT REGION MADRID — Spain Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and Belgium Prime Minister Alexander de Croo will visit Israel and Palestinian territories on Thursday, the Spanish government said. Spain holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council and Belgium will take over in January. They will meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as with Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The government said the talks will focus on protection for civilians, the release of hostages, humanitarian access to Gaza and respect for international humanitarian law. It added they would also discuss the need for a lasting political solution for the region, based on the two-states solution.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:42 pm A 19-year-old Laurel woman suffered a gunshot in the cheek while her boyfriend’s father was unloading a handgun and it went off in an adjacent room on Tuesday night, according to a report from the Jones County Sheriff’s Department. Shauna Lovett had a 9mm bullet lodged in the roof of her mouth when Deputy Robert Yates arrived at the residence in the 1100 block of Tower Road, just south of Ellisville, a little after 7:45 p.m. Lovett had a wound to her right cheek and was “bleeding heavily from her mouth,” according to the report, but she was able to answer questions and told Yates and medical personnel from EMServ Ambulance that she could feel the bullet in the roof of her mouth. David Anthony Pool, 47, told the deputy that he was in a bedroom unloading the Taurus 9mm handgun when it went off and the projectile went through a wall and struck Lovett, who was sitting on a couch in the living room. Pool said that the firearm was missing a part and when he “racked the slide, there was a round in the chamber that didn’t eject” and when he “let the slide go forward on the round in the chamber the gun went off.” His son David Joseph Pool, 20, was sitting beside Lovett on the couch when he heard the shot and saw that she had been struck in the face, according to the report. Yates noted that there was a hole in the bedroom wall and the handgun was on top of a pile of clothes in the bedroom with a loaded magazine. The scene was secured for Investigators Denny Graham and Troy Lewis to come and process it. It appears to be an accidental shooting, Graham said. Lovett was transported by EMServ to Forrest General Hospital for treatment. A volunteer emergency medical responder from Moselle Volunteer Fire Department also assisted. It was the third accidental shooting in a three-day period that the JCSD has been called to investigate. On Saturday night, 11-year-old Gauge Chancellor was shot in the head with a .22-caliber rifle in a hunting accident in Ovett and died Tuesday. On Sunday morning, 36-year-old Willie Hall Lack was hit “between the eyes” with a bullet from a .380-caliber handgun that was under a hunting rifle he was attempting to retrieve from a closet shelf. He and Lovett are both expected to recover from their injuries.
