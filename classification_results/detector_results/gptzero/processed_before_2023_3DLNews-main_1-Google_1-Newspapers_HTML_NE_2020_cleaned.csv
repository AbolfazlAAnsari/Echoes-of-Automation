Lincoln, Neb. —Many cow-calf producers in Nebraska have become accustomed to using distillers grains as a source of both protein and energy to help meet the nutritional needs of lactating cows from calving until green grass is available. Due to the ongoing distillers shortage, many producers are considering including corn silage in the ration to help alleviate some of the energy shortfall in their hay resources. However, concerns have been expressed that silage in the diet will result in diarrhea or scours in their calves. While this is a critical time for the nursing calf, and producers should be ever vigilant for signs of scours, there are actually a variety of reasons a calf might have a very loose stool and not all of them are cause for concern. Feeding a diet that is highly digestible and fermented, with a high rate of passage through the digestive system will result in manure that is much more wet and loose than manure from a diet of dry hay and supplemental distillers grains. In dairy cows, a high-energy diet has been shown to increase milk production earlier in lactation, and a similar response is likely in beef cows. Increased milk production early in the calf’s life will also likely result in a looser stool. Additionally, calves begin to nibble at grass and their mother’s feed within a few days of life, and by one month of age, are eating 1 percent of their body weight on a dry matter basis in feed other than milk. Therefore, they will begin to consume a diet that is responsible for a looser stool just like the cow does. However, dietary related scours do not cause illness and dehydration in the calf. The health- and life-threatening causes of diarrhea in calves are commonly from a list of infectious pathogens that are shed at low levels by individuals in virtually any group of bovines. Most are viral or protozoal, and some are bacterial. These pathogens are picked up by calves, amplified, and shed at much higher levels into the environment, mainly in feces. Calves born later in the calving season are often born into environments that have much higher levels of these pathogens present than the earliest calves experienced, and as a result, the later-born calves are at higher risk of getting sick. One method that many producers have been successfully implementing in Nebraska for years to break this chain of transmission is called Sandhills Calving. This method involves keeping cow-calf pairs with only calves born in the same one- to two-week period together until the youngest calves are at least a month old. This prevents amplification of pathogens from continuing to accelerate and provides a fresh start for each one- to two-week cohort of calves. When cow-calf pairs are in pens in the spring, the calves need a clean, dry place to lie down. Usually, this needs to be somewhere that the cows can’t get into. It needs to be out of the wind. Shelter can be beneficial if the ventilation is adequate. Producers demonstrate a lot of creativity in designing and building simple, cost-effective calf shelters. Sometimes it can be as simple as an electric fence stretched diagonally across the corners of the pen, raised high so calves can go freely underneath, but the cows are fenced out. This allows calves an “escape” where they can lay in some clean dry straw or corn stover. The best way to judge whether a calf with a loose stool needs treatment is by its attitude and appetite. If it is bright, alert, active and interested in eating, it is likely doing alright. If the calf is listless, moving slowly, ears drooping, and does not appear to be interested in eating or nursing, treatment is likely needed. One exception to that would be if there was blood in the feces. That should be treated quickly. Fluid replacement is the cornerstone of treatment for scours, though antibiotics may also be necessary in certain situations. A calf that can stand may respond well to treatment with oral electrolytes, but a calf with diarrhea that won’t or can’t stand is very likely in dire need of intravenous fluid therapy. Your veterinarian can help you develop a plan for treating scours in calves if the need arises.

Diller-Odell volleyball players Addison Heidemann (left) and Karli Heidemann pose for a portrait, Monday, Nov. 2, 2020. Nebraska is one of the top states in the nation per capita for producing college volleyball players at the NCAA Division I level. We’ll be reminded of that again next week on National Signing Day for college volleyball, when several players will sign on to Division I programs. They include three in-state players who will sign with the Huskers — Omaha Skutt’s Lindsay Krause, Elkhorn South’s Rylee Gray and Waverly’s Whitney Lauenstein. Still, what’s happening on the volleyball court at Diller-Odell is really something. There are only 27 girls in the high school, but two of them will probably play Division I volleyball. That would be sisters Addison and Karli Heidemann, who are leading Class D-2’s No. 1 team into the state tournament this week. And this small-town story gets better. The Heidemanns live on a farm just outside of Harbine, a small village on U.S. 136 between Beatrice and Fairbury. “It’s tiny. There a few houses there,” said Addison Heidemann of Harbine. But that village can claim a couple of nationally ranked volleyball recruits. Addison Heidemann is a setter who will join the Iowa State volleyball team next fall as a walk-on. She’s ranked 127th in the nation in the senior class by PrepVolleyball.com. Karli Heidemann is a hard-hitting, 6-foot-2 outside hitter. She’s only a sophomore, so her college recruiting won’t get serious until this summer, but she’s ranked No. 63 nationally in her class. Prepdig.com lists her as the No. 2 player in the state in her class. The recruiting rankings are largely based on club volleyball tournaments, and the Heidemanns play for Volleyball Club Nebraska, the Lincoln-based club founded by former Nebraska setter Maggie Griffin. While Diller-Odell has been a successful program, the odds aren’t high for what’s happened for a team playing in the smallest of Nebraska’s six classes. “It’s not very common that you get two Division I athletes out of a small, D-2 school,” said Diller-Odell coach Reba Hestermann. Addison Heidemann credits both her club team and high school, along with having played for so long. “I come from a small school, so basically everyone starts playing sports when they’re really young,” she said. During a club tryout Griffin felt like Addison Heidemann could be a good setter, and they worked for several years to develop those skills. Once she reached high school, Iowa State coaches saw her play and invited her to attend one of their summer camps. During the club season the family makes the one-hour trip to Lincoln about three times per week. There also were opportunities for them to improve in open gym sessions at Diller-Odell — there were good players there, too. There are only 11 players out for volleyball, but several of them play club, either for Nebraska Juniors or VCN. Many of the schools in Class D aren’t that close to a city that have multiple options for a club volleyball experience. Another senior, outside hitter Ava Lovitt, is committed to play at Hastings. Karli Heidemann earned all-state honors as a freshman last season when Diller-Odell won the Class D-1 state championship, and is the go-to player for the Griffins this season. “I think (Karli) can go high-tier Division I volleyball. She has the potential,” her sister said. Karli Heidemann has 454 kills this season with a .415 hitting percentage. She’s averaging a remarkable 5.3 kills per set. Her season high for kills was 30 against Falls City Sacred Heart. Diller-Odell won state last year but had a lot of work to do this season to replace starters at both middle blocker and libero. Also, head coach Kandice Jurgens stepped down after winning state so she could have more time to watch her daughter, Madison, play for the South Dakota volleyball team. Hestermann was previously an assistant at the school. Sent weekly directly to your inbox! Daily Sun sports editor Larry Coorts wore almost every hat at Adams, and later, Freeman High Schools.

Read these thoughts from our readers! Our state continues to hemorrhage our youth. For some reason they don’t find this state attractive. Our government tries so hard to make it that way. While Attorney General Hilgers has shown great skill at legislating on behalf of executive priorities, I prefer my elected representative — state senators — to do the lawmaking. The new year is beginning, so it is time to turn the page. And, turning that new page should include a change in leadership in the 3rd Congressional District in Nebraska, i.e., replace Rep. Adrian Smith. Red Way’s mismanagement of funds was a disappointment. The innovation that the Lincoln Airport leadership has demonstrated is a success. Thank you Patty Pansing Brooks for your poem (""The slight before Christmas,"" Dec. 29). What a clever way to shine the light on the dissimulation of that one line by Gov. Jim Pillen: ""I don\'t believe in welfare."" Gov. Jim Pillen has proposed raising the sales tax by 2 cents, which would make Nebraska\'s sales tax the highest in the nation. Although the details have not been released, the governor\'s office suggests this would drop the property tax from the highest in the nation to 27th. Dave Kirby in his Dec. 31 letter to the editor asks, ""How many is enough?"" referring to the immigration crisis and placing the blame for it on the Biden Administration. I was born in Norfolk. I follow Nebraska closely. I live in Houston, Texas, home of strip clubs and oil business. So believe me when I say taxing petroleum products going through your state is more lucrative than taxing attendees to strip clubs or strip clubs themselves. Theater and concert ticket prices are out of control. The performing arts are almost exclusively for the rich. American helped create NATO more than 70 years ago with the goal of preventing an attack from the Soviet Union/Russia. When the Russian attack came, the hammer fell on a country outside that alliance. Ukraine indeed took the entire brunt of the invasion, resisted, and turned the tide. Jim Pillen will go down in Nebraska history as the greatest governor ever, and he is just getting started. Gov. Jim Pillen\'s decision not to apply for federal funding for children\'s summer food programs is short-sighted in dealing with fiscal responsibility. It was estimated that to manage the $18 million in aid it would cost $300,000. That leaves more than $17 million that would be spent in our urban and rural communities. Gov. Jim Pillen\'s refusal to apply for more than $18 million in federal funds to help feed our less fortunate children only proves two things: 1) He\'s even worse of a governor than Jiminy Ricketts, and 2) he\'s not ""pro-life"" at all. He\'s just ""pro-fetus."" An article in the Dec. 26 issue of the Journal Star indicates that a primary focus in the 2024 session of the Nebraska Legislature will be to address the matter of workforce development. Nebraska’s rural communities face a major problem, and our state’s leadership must act now to stave off disaster. Earlier this year, the Nebraska Hospital Association, Nebraska Rural Health Association, and Nebraska Health Care Workforce Collaborative jointly released a report outlining the … Nursing shortage Check out this week\'s batch of letters to the editor.

for the Mafia’s code of silence. When a button soldier was arrested he was expected, upon pain of death, to maintain complete silence regarding the crimes of his fellow Mafioso. The code broke down after the FBI got serious and started making arrests. When confronted with the choice of a long prison stretch or testifying against the family, the Mafia’s “made men” sang like canaries. Surprisingly, Omerta was contagious. Close contact with Mafia members during investigations has caused Omerta to jump the lawbreaker — law enforcement barrier and spread to the FBI. My prediction is Omerta will last much longer among the corrupt FBI’s headquarters staff. That’s because the chances of special agents who break the law being prosecuted by fellow members of the Injustice Department are slim and none. Three years of the Russia Collusion Delusion has given Americans a good idea of who the major players in the conspiracy were. Text messages show the whole Russia investigation was the FBI doing opposition research on Trump for Hillary Clinton. It quickly became obvious to the minions that the scope of the unprecedented tampering with Trump’s campaign was driven by conspiracy-obsessed anti-Trump fanatics. The pursuit of Michael Flynn was a witch hunt from the beginning, with no basis in reality. It was simply a way to get back at Flynn, whom Obama hated, and disrupt the Trump administration. Instead of using a subpoena to investigate Flynn’s finances, which require a judge to approve, rogue FBI agents used a “national security letter” that bypassed judicial review and didn’t require probable cause. The actions of the leaders of the FBI and the Obama administration — who should have been defending the Constitution — remind me of the KGB under Lavrentiy Beria who famously told Stalin that guilt or innocence were unimportant, “Show me the man and I’ll show you the crime.” Michael Flynn was the man. The minions understood the ruse. “What do we expect to get from an NSL(?)” an agent texted. “We put out traces, tripwires to community and nothing.” “(B)ingo,” was the response. “(S)o what’s an NSL going to do — no content. If we’re working to close down the cases, I’m not sure what NSL results would do to help.” “(E)xactly that makes no sense,” was the reply. It got so bad, some agents even took Trump’s side and said the president was correct when he tweeted “The ‘Intelligence’ briefing on so-called ‘Russian hacking’ was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!” The texts again, “So (the Trump investigation) is going to stay open???” “(Y)ep. (C)rimes report being drafted.” “(Obscenity),” the first agent replied. “(Cheese whiz),” a third agent wrote. “(T)rump was right. (S)till not put together….why do we do this to ourselves. (W)hat is wrong with these people?” What indeed? The minions saw the Constitution being undermined. They saw the FBI being perverted by power-mad bureaucrats. They witnessed the law and FBI regulations being broken. And what did they do? Become whistleblowers? Leak to the press? Resign in protest? Make an arrest on their own? Certainly not. Like good Mafioso, they observed the code of Omerta. They hedged their bets by buying personal liability insurance to protect themselves if a new attorney general started asking pertinent questions. Aside from that, they continued to be Good Germans and follow orders as willing participants in the greatest political scandal in U.S. history. There was no one in the FBI or the Justice Department with the moral courage to put a stop to this coup. There was no one willing to defend the Constitution or the 63 million Americans who voted for Trump. They kept quiet and kept their jobs at the expense of their honor and our country. Conservatives can stop dreaming about a groundswell of law enforcement officers and government officials bravely remembering their oaths. Federal law enforcement officers who will refuse to obey unconstitutional orders from a Biden/Harris administration. The left has both Omerta and the FBI. We are on our own. Recently, I traveled to France with a delegation of my congressional colleagues, led by House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), to honor the 80th anniversary of the Allied invasion on D-Day on the battlefields where 150,000 young men from the United States and our allies commenced the la… The circus came to California a long time ago, and there are no signs it’s packing any time soon.

The Cowboys - who have not been the NFC title game, let alone the Super Bowl, since the last of their five Super Bowl titles in 1995 - are hoping it will come together in short order. Owner Jerry Jones wanted an experienced and proven winner to replace the fired Jason Garrett, as he believes the Cowboys are a team built to win now. In addition to the West Coast offense, McCarthy is expected to bring discipline and accountability to the Cowboys' locker room. While it took the Joneses seven days to officially move on from Garrett following his fourth 8-8 seasons in 9 1/2 years as head coach, the Cowboys quickly identified McCarthy as the man to lead the team into the next decade. He interviewed Saturday, stayed overnight and then accepted the job Monday morning by agreeing to a five-year contract. McCarthy has since gone about the business of making the transition to Cowboys coach, identifying his three coordinators in Kellen Moore (offense), Mike Nolan (defense) and Jim Fassel (special teams), as well as hiring Jim Tomsula as the defensive line coach.

Lincoln, Neb. —Mint is not grown commercially in Nebraska on a large scale yet — there are less than 500 acres — but a project at the University of Nebraska Panhandle Research and Extension Center in Scottsbluff is aimed at providing answers about whether farmers could grow it here and which varieties might grow best. A three-year research project is underway to identify the best mint varieties for western Nebraska. The investigation began in 2018 and is scheduled to continue through the 2020 growing season. The project is funded by a Nebraska Department of Agriculture Specialty Crop Block Grant, and is carried out in collaboration with Mahesh Pattabiraman, associate professor of organic chemistry at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. Mint is a genus of 25 species of fragrant herbs native to Eurasia, North America, southern Africa and Australia. Two types of mint are produced commercially, peppermint and spearmint. Three countries are currently the major producers of mint: the United States, India and China. The United States is a leader in peppermint oil production, producing 70% of the world's output. Peppermint production in the United States is concentrated in the northwestern states of Oregon, Washington and Idaho, which account for 84% of U.S. mint production. Acres harvested ranged from 20,800 acres to 25,800 acres during 2013-2018. The total value of U.S. mint is about $200 million. The price per pound received by growers in 2018 was $19.80 for peppermint and $16.80 for spearmint. Western Nebraska’s climate is similar to those states, so commercial production of high-quality mint oil is possible here. But there are unknowns for producing mint in the Nebraska Panhandle, such as which varieties are best adapted, what are their characteristics, or which have the most potential for high-yielding biomass and high oil content. In 2018, the first year of the mint project in Scottsbluff, University of Nebraska–Lincoln research crews planted 14 mint varieties, including six peppermint varieties, six spearmint varieties and two intermediate mint varieties. They were planted with 22-inch row spacing and a distance of 5 inches between plants. The varieties were planted in late May through the first week in June, similar to dry edible beans. The mint was grown under irrigation using standard production methods. Data was collected related to plant growth and development, including plant vigor, flowering time, plant height, pigmentation, any disease and more. Differences were noted between the two types of mint. Spearmint’s growth rate was almost twice that of peppermint, and it flowered around mid-June. Peppermint flowered around the end of July. Spearmint was harvested twice, the first time in early July, the second time in late September. Peppermint was harvested once, in August. Harvested samples were dried and weighed to determine dry biomass yield. Subsamples of dry biomass were used to analyze mint oil, both quantity and quality. There was a significant yield difference among the varieties. Among the findings of the data from the first two years of study: * All the mint varieties had a similar height pattern, ranging from 7 to 13 inches. * Mint can grow in an aggressive manner with basal shoots, thus row spacing can be one important aspect to consider during planting. * Among the varieties planted, in peppermint, Todd mint had the highest menthol content. In spearmint, Scotch had the highest carvone content. (Menthol is the primary oil type for peppermint, carvone is the primary oil type of spearmint.) The existing small acreage of mint farm in the North Platte Valley is planted with a single spearmint and single peppermint variety, but it is unknown whether those specific varieties are the best for western Nebraska. Currently, there is no data on which mint variety is the best for western Nebraska climate. Therefore, results of this project will provide choices for selecting the best variety. The next step will be on optimizing nitrogen fertilizer management in collaboration with Bijesh Maharjan, soil and nutrient management specialist at the Panhandle Center. Mint is grown in well-drained soil, with nitrogen input as high as 294 pounds per acre and high-water input. This warrants a need to optimize nitrogen management in spearmint production that will not only economically benefit producers but also reduce potential nitrate-N loss through leaching in such a high input system. With availability of the best mint variety and optimal nitrogen management practices, the mint production in the region potentially will be profitable and sustainable.

Anthony Parker, left, and Sarah Ortegon film a scene near Bancroft for a promotional video for the upcoming film ""Bright Eyes,"" based on the life of Omaha tribe member Susette La Flesche. Pathway Films will soon begin fundraising for a movie on the life of Omaha Native American Susette La Flesche set to film in the Omaha area. The film, “Bright Eyes,” is set to start filming early next year. Producer Jerry Thompson and the film’s main actors, Sarah Ortegon and Anthony Parker, filmed a promotional video near Bancroft Thursday and Friday for its Kickstarter. The movie has potential plans to shoot in the Fremont area and has several residents helping in its production, including Dana and Joel Reeves of Reeves Media Group and The Digg Site Productions, as well as Stacy Heatherly, who is founder of The Dig Site and commissioner of the Eastern Nebraska Film Office. The film’s Kickstarter will allow donations of $25 to $5,000 toward “Bright Eyes” and should go live before the end of September. More information on the film can be found at brighteyesmovie.com. “Bright Eyes” is named after the Omaha tribe name of Susette La Flesche, a Native American rights advocate in the late 19th century. She first received recognition for facilitating the trial of Standing Bear in 1879. La Flesche traveled the East Coast with her brother, Francis, Standing Bear and her future husband, Omaha Herald assistant editor Thomas Tibbles. Here attracted the attention of people such as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Louisa May Alcott, and she would also dine with former President Rutherford B. Hayes. La Flesche was also the first woman to speak at Faneuil Hall in Boston, and along with her husband, reported at the Battle of Wounded Knee and helped the injured and dying. Thompson said he first became familiar with La Flesche while working on publicity for the 1981 film “Windwalker.” As he was sent to Omaha, a member of the Omaha tribe told him about her story. While many tribe members are aware of La Flesche’s sister, Susan, who was one of the first Native Americans to earn a medical degree, Thompson said not many people knew about La Flesche’s story. Thompson soon read the book “Bright Eyes: The Story of Susette LaFlesche, An Omaha Indian” by Dorothy Clarke Wilson, and knew he wanted to adapt La Flesche’s life. “So now here we are, 38 years later, and I’ve made some films, a couple features, some documentaries,” he said. “And in 2016, I visited the tribe and felt like it was the time to do this.” After meeting with the tribe’s members, Thompson said the project was met with excitement and goosebumps as they gave him their blessing to move forward with the film. “So I’ve been to the reservation four times, just wanting to respect them, make sure everything is how they would like it to be and if anything needed to be changed, they’d tell me now,” he said. “Because I want everybody to be happy, and the story’s a great story.” Thompson, who will be using Wilson’s book as the basis for the film, said the book has a wide variety of humorous and emotional scenes, including the Trail of Tears and Standing Bear’s trial. “It’s the underdog story of people fighting for justice, and victory when they did that,” he said. Around a year ago, Thompson starting holding auditions with tribal members for roles in the film and scouting locations, and a few months ago, he found his lead actors. Despite some rainy weather in Nebraska this week, Thompson said he and the Omaha film crew were able to get great footage of the actors, whom he met for the first time in-person this week. “It really went well, as far as the chemistry and how we got it done,” he said. “So we’re all excited to see this Kickstarter to make this film happen.” Ortegon, who will portray La Flesche, is an actor and dancer originally from Denver. After being crowned Miss Native American USA in 2013 and 2014, she began her acting career on the stage with the play “Black Elk Speaks” and the musical “Sitting Bull’s Last Waltz.” Ortegon was also cast as an extra in the miniseries “Jamestown” and was cast in the 2019 PBS documentary “The Art of Home: A Wind River Story,” which was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category of Cultural Documentary. Prior to receiving the role of La Flesche, Ortegon said she wrote in her journal that she had wanted to be a lead and prayed to the Creator to lead her in the right direction. The very next day, Ortegon said she received a phone call, as the film’s production had asked one of her friends for her information. “And he gave them my phone number, they called me, so I was really surprised,” she said. “So I sent an audition just one day later, and I actually got the role.” Ortegon said she was drawn to the role for La Flesche’s political activism, and recently found out about her art as well. “Interestingly enough, I’m also an artist and I’ve worked in law at a law firm for four years, and I just relate so much to her character, and I speak out a lot about the injustices that we still face as indigenous people with oil and gas and trying to prevent that from polluting our water systems,” she said. Ortegon said she was looking forward to the film’s production to start and was excited to portray La Flesche. “I relate to her character on a personal level, and I believe that her story definitely needs to be told because historically, she was able to change things,” she said. “And that’s why I would love to continue to play her character.” La Flesche’s father, Joseph, will be portrayed by Parker, known as Nudahunga, or “chief,” with the Omaha tribe. He lived with the tribe until 1985, and became an actor in the late 1990s. Parker’s first speaking role was as a courtroom deputy in the 2003 television movie “Coyote Waits.” He also played a warrior in Terrence Malick’s 2005 film “The New World, which stared Colin Farrell and Christian Bale, and has portrayed various other Native American chief roles. “So I’ve played a lot of these stoic roles, and I wanted to play something that I’m currently going to play now,” he said. “[Joseph La Flesche’s] a chief, but he mainly is a father too, which I am, so I’m able to connect with that.” Parker said he first found out about the role on social media, sent in his acting reel and received the part. He said he was drawn to Joseph La Flesche, as he wanted the best for his children, and seeing that Native Americans’ ways of life would soon change, he sent his children to school in New Jersey. “We would have to adapt to that, and it was [Chief] Big Elk’s vision, that the Omaha would have to acquire these newfound skills to be able to survive in what would be the new world,” Parker said. “Because it wasn’t going to stay how it was, it was going to change, and we had to find a way to change with it.” Joseph La Flesche, known as Iron Eye, succeeded Big Elk as chief. Parker said he remembered hearing stories about him from his grandmother growing up. “I don’t really speak Omaha myself, but when I hear the language, it just brings back a lot of memories,” he said. “So that’s why I’m really interested in playing this part and being involved in this.” Like other Omaha tribe members, Parker said he knew more about Susette La Flesche’s sister and her work. “I wasn’t really familiar with Susette, and so I’m learning from this,” he said. “So I’m just really excited about being a part of this.” With the film’s production, Thompson said he plans to hire members of the tribe to build an actual village, which would be left in place as a tourist attraction. Additionally, the wide-release film will dedicate at least 50% of its net profits to the Omaha and Ponca tribes, as well as Native American causes. “So that’s the exciting part of it, too, is we hope people want to invest in the Kickstarter, not just to get a DVD of the movie and not just to make it happen, but to make it so successful that Native Americans will be helped through'}]"

Lakeview\'s Kienan Prorok comes around the curve during the Knights of Columbus meet in April 2019. Prorok will compete for Mount Marty next season. Kienan Prorok has faced a lot of uncertainty in the past few months. The Lakeview senior always dreamed of playing college sports, but after the spring season was canceled he wasn\'t sure if that was still a possibility. Prorok was featured in the pages of The Telegram on May 10 as one of dozens of area seniors who had lost his senior season to the coronavirus. He had hope for impressing a college track coach with a big senior campaign, but suddenly lost his opportunity when the NSAA cancelled the season on April 2. Yet, not all hope was lost. Thanks to connections from Lakeview track coach TJ Nielsen, Prorok committed to Mount Marty, relieving some stress and bringing into focus a future that was rather murky just a month ago. ""I was excited because I never thought I would get any offers since there was no season,"" Prorok said. ""I’m just blessed these colleges reached out to me and I can’t be any more thankful for that."" Growing up, Prorok was always invested in sports; from watching the NBA and the NFL to playing youth baseball. He later developed a passion for hoops, and he was hooked on the hardwood for several years. ""Originally, track wasn’t my thing,"" he said. ""I was always a basketball guy. I wanted to play college basketball. I didn’t have the best season and I realized I had more potential at track earlier this year."" Lakeview finished 9-13 after graduating a large senior class. Though it was a struggle at first, the Vikings eventually turned it around late. Even so, it was a learning curve for everyone, giving Prorok few highlights on film. That\'s when he turned his focus to a future in track. Prorok qualified for state in the long jump last season, spent more time training since then and had designs on a return to Burke Stadium in more than just one event. A medal or two and a good showing and certainly the college interest would come. When it all went away, there was more than just a little concern. ""The season being taken away from him, I think that kind of hit him,"" Nielsen said. ""We had discussed before the season a little bit because I knew he wanted to get into college track. First of all, he just really loves the sport and loves to compete."" He wasn\'t sure he had done enough in his three seasons to attract the attention of colleges, but Prorok\'s worries were put to rest when letters and phone calls began to find him. ""Just colleges reaching out to me, they told me I had so much potential,"" Prorok said. ""That’s why I just thought I wanted to do track in college."" There were a lot of qualities that made the fourth-year Viking stand out. ""I think first of all he was a really good teammate, and I think that’s important,"" Nielsen said. ""He’s a great teammate. For him athletically, he has a really nice, long stride. Obviously, he has good sprinting ability and where he excelled his junior year was in the long jump."" Thanks to the potential Prorok exhibited last year, and Nielsen\'s connections, concern turned to opportunity. Suddenly he had four possible landing spots: Mount Marty, Doane, Midland and Concordia. With an improving program that sent multiple athletes to nationals last season, Mount Marty felt like the right choice. ""I just heard they were doing great things up there,"" Prorok said. ""Coach Becker knows what he’s doing. He said I was one of the missing pieces and I wanted to be a part of that."" While the future Lancer now knows where he\'ll be this fall, his next decision is an area of study. He had set his plans for Wayne State and sports management when everything quickly changed. He\'s now weighing his options with an eye on one day becoming a coach. Whatever he decides, Nielsen said Mount Marty will be adding a hard-working and driven student athlete who, though he keeps to himself, isn\'t afraid to set the tone by example. ""He’s a very quiet kid,"" Nielsen said. ""His effort was really high. He worked extremely hard. He’s a great teammate. He always had a good, positive attitude and was very coachable. He’s willing to listen and try to do things better the next time. He’s very coachable and has gotten along with everyone."" Peter Huguenin is a sports reporter for The Columbus Telegram.

Nebraska’s Second Congressional District. The district that makes up all of Douglas County and parts of Sarpy got some recognition yesterday when Nate Silver, founder and editor of FiveThirtyEight, tweeted that 2020 could come down to the district. It’s all going to come down to the recount in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. — Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) September 2, 2020 Politically inclined Nebraskans’ blood pressures rose as some around the country, at least the portion that follows this kind of stuff closely, turned its attention toward the state. Nebraska and Maine are the only two states that split their electoral votes. The decision narrowly passed the legislature in 1992 by a vote of 25 to 23 before then Gov. Ben Nelson signed it into law. The thought was the change would bring more attention to presidential elections, though any district in Nebraska has hardly come close to a deciding factor. In fact the only time NE-2 has split from the rest of the state on a presidential election was in 2008 when Barack Obama targeted the area in his race against John McCain. It’s gone reliably Republican every other time. Some used certain expletives to describe where Silver was pulling this scenario out of. And it wouldn’t be wrong to doubt. The stakes in Nebraska are relatively low. The prize of winning NE-2 is one electoral vote out of five in the state and 538 across the nation. Bigger trophy swing states like Arizona, Pennsylvania and Florida, with 60 electoral votes between them, which Silver pointed out, will undoubtedly play a much larger role. But tides are changing in NE-2. Kara Eastman, a progressive Democratic candidate running on healthcare reform, continues beating centrists in primaries and narrowly lost to Rep. Don Bacon in 2016. Right now, many projection models are leaning strongly toward Democratic candidate Joe Biden over President Donald Trump. However, the latter defied projections in 2016 to win the election—Silver’s own site took a credibility hit as it had projected a Clinton victory. Both campaigns have presences in the community and candidates for Congressional representative have tied the race closely to national movements in progressive politics. But if it comes down to the wire, who knows, NE-2 and its measly one vote, could play a huge part in tipping the scales one way or the other for this election. Chris has worked for The Reader since January 2020. As an investigative reporter and news editor he’s taken deep dives into topics such as police transparency, affordable housing and COVID-19.

village leaders have begun accepting bids to demolish a vacated 108-year-old school building. Hordville High School graduate and longtime village board member Rod Blasé said removing such an iconic building is an emotional decision for some local residents, though board members agree the time has finally come. ESU9 helping local schools offer mental health services Helping kids cope with life and the challenges of learning in a COVID-era world is a passion for Emily Hoegh, who began a new role this summer as a mental health practitioner with ESU9 serving Aurora and Hampton public schools. Knowing how to spot signs of anxiety and depression and then how to offer needed support is a timely topic in the midst of a pandemic, though Hoegh has long believed in the need for providing mental health services. Extension ag day gives students hands-on exposure Aurora fourth graders spent quality time Oct. 8 at the fairgrounds, getting up close and personal with the agriculture industry. Out of four sessions, one included a popcorn presentation by Mariah Newmyer (Food, Nutrition and Health Extension Educator), another was a combine harvester walkthrough via AKRS, as well as a grain presentation by the Aurora Coop and a visit by the Husker Beef Lab. Huskies take runner-up at Central Conference race The Aurora boys cross country team ran off with a runner-up finish at the Central Conference meet Thursday afternoon at Veteran’s Park in Grand Island. The 2nd place finish as a team is nothing to sniff at, Aurora coach Tony Sigler pointed out given the talent across the board in the Central Conference. “We have a really tough conference on both sides and so to come away with a top two on either side is always really impressive,” Sigler reflected. Marching Huskies take to the field once again, appreciation day The Aurora Marching Huskies held a public performance for friends, family and community members on Saturday afternoon. Those in attendance were treated to not only the field show but also a sampling of the parade routine and the pregame show. “I think that the parents and community were very pleased with the decision to have this,” band director Dan Sodomka explained. “When we first made the decision to have the ACME (Aurora Covid Marching Exhibition) event we were very fortunate to be able to have the bands sit in the stands with their masks on.""

GALLOWAY TOWNSHIP — Sam O’Brien had just returned to work after quarantining for 14 days due to contracting COVID-19. She’s a registered nurse at AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center’s Mainland Campus and didn’t have an assignment on her first day back. Soon enough, she was given one. That’s how she met Joey Ortiz, a 46-year-old Hammonton resident with Down syndrome who was hospitalized with the virus. Ortiz was admitted on Mother’s Day and stayed for three weeks. “I can only imagine how he was feeling being isolated and never being away from home before,” O’Brien said. She could tell Ortiz’s spirits were low as he would only give one-word answers, and she had an inkling his vocabulary was likely more robust than that. “I thought if I could cheer him up, then he would open up a little more,” she said. The nurse picked up a black marker and started drawing on the glass window of Ortiz’s hospital room door. She drew a smiley face, flowers, a cat and a dog. Connecting with patients, and their families, is part of a nurse’s job, said Kim Clements, clinical director for critical care and emergency services at AtlantiCare. But making that connection amid a global pandemic, when social distancing is encouraged and masks are mandatory, is a little harder. But it’s not impossible. “We go into nursing and hold people’s hands and hug families. We’re in people’s personal spaces,” Clements said. “Not being able to do that is difficult, so it’s nice to see people getting creative. Going forward, I think that’s part of our future.” The creativity was comforting for Ortiz’s family as well. Gladys Ortiz, Joey’s mother, cares for him on a daily basis. Due to the virus, she could not visit her son in the hospital and had to trust in the hospital staff that he was given the best care. If she could have, she would have been by his side day and night. Instead, her daughter, Norma, talked to the nursing staff two to three times a day to check on Joey’s condition. “The nurses were very nice. I was very happy,” Gladys Ortiz said. “And Joey seemed OK. Quiet and scared, but OK. “But I cried every day.” Ortiz was treated so well by his nurses that he once told his mom on a phone call that he wanted to stay in the hospital. “I don’t want to come home,” Gladys Ortiz recalled him saying. “They loved Joey a lot,” she said of the nurses. “But I’m happy. I’m very, very happy because I have my son.” And even though all of the nursing staff members work to make every patient feel comfortable and happy, O’Brien felt a deeper understanding of what the COVID-19 patients were going through because she had the virus herself. “One patient said, ‘I never want to feel like this again,’ and I totally get it,” she said. But she knew she couldn’t hug them or hold their hand, so finding a different way to make them smile felt good. “Even though that was one isolated incident, it’s not the only time we connected with anyone,” she said. “It was a little snapshot of what we do on a daily basis.” “It’s inspiring,” she added. “It makes me feel like I’m doing something right … as far as life choices go in becoming a nurse.” Clements said O’Brien leading the way by drawing on the window and making a patient smile has been uplifting for the whole team. “Everyone should be kind because not everything is rainbows and butterflies,” O’Brien said. “That took me two minutes to make somebody’s day.” Contact: 609-272-7239 CFairfield@pressofac.com Twitter @ACPress_CJ Sign up now to get the most recent coronavirus headlines and other important local and national news sent to your email inbox daily.

Aaron Sanderford World-Herald Staff Writers Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse sets down with the World-Herald for a wide ranging conversation. As Republicans in Congress find themselves under pressure over whether to back President Donald Trump in his unfounded insistence that he won the election and his new demand for bigger stimulus checks, two Nebraskans are pushing back. Sen. Ben Sasse and Rep. Don Bacon were among the first Republicans in Congress to acknowledge that Joe Biden won the presidential race. Ben Sasse On Wednesday, after Trump issued his second big batch of pardons, including to former campaign aides Paul Manafort and Roger Stone, Sasse issued a brief condemnation of what he called pardons to a “tranche of felons”: “This is rotten to the core,” he said. The New York Times, meanwhile, reported that Bacon lashed out at Trump’s demand for a $2,000 check to households, rather than the $600 payment included in a hard-fought compromise relief package of nearly $1 trillion. During a private conference call of House Republicans, the paper reported, Bacon said Trump had thrown the GOP lawmakers under the bus. In a statement afterward, Bacon said, “I stand by what I said,” adding that “the COVID supplemental is a good compromise, and the president should take it.” Don Bacon House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday that House Democrats would vote Monday on a standalone bill that would provide direct payments to Americans of $2,000 per person. Her announcement came moments after House Republicans blocked a Democratic bid to increase the payments from the $600 per individual as passed in the stimulus bill earlier this week to the $2,000 amount. Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb said Sasse’s criticism of Trump is mostly empty. “This is 100% Ben Sasse,” she tweeted late Wednesday. “When it matters, he says nothing. When the tide has turned, he grabs a surfboard to ride the wave.” Among other Nebraska Republicans in Congress, Reps. Jeff Fortenberry and Adrian Smith signed onto a friend of the court brief in a case filed by the Texas attorney general seeking to throw out election results in Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson also signed on in support of the suit, which was quickly dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court, which said Texas lacked standing to challenge other states’ election rules. Fortenberry acknowledged Biden as president-elect after the Supreme Court order. Sen. Deb Fischer indicated before the Electoral College voted Biden as president-elect on Dec. 14 that the former vice president was the likely winner. On another issue, Trump’s veto Wednesday of the National Defense Authorization Act affected separate proposals from Sasse and Bacon. Sasse has described the importance to national security of getting 25 recommendations from the Cyber Solarium Commission that his 2018 bill created into the defense bill. His group has been planning for the broad strategic outlines of how the United States can more effectively wage and deter cyberwarfare. Bacon, a retired Air Force brigadier general, co-sponsored the bill’s proposal to strip American military bases of the names of confederate leaders, telling White House officials in July — during a tough re-election race — that Republicans “are the party of Lincoln, the party of emancipation. We’re not the party of Jim Crow. We should be on the right side of this issue.” Trump criticized the base-renaming provision in vetoing the broader bill. GOP members of Congress passed the bill with a veto-proof majority. Now they’ll have to see if they can hold it. Trump also repeated his demand that the defense bill add an unrelated provision eliminating the liability protections afforded to social media companies protecting them from lawsuits related to online posts by people and on behalf of groups and organizations.

He also took a moment to thank all of the employees at the Historic Hartington Hotel and the Cedar County Veterinarian Services Clinic who had their work lives turned upside down as the production company moved into town. “I know that we kind of drive you guys crazy. We make it harder for you guys to do your jobs every day and you feel like you are walking around under lights all day and you never know when a camera is going to pop up and surprise you, but you all handle it with grace,” While the long work days can be a grind, working on the show can also be a lot of fun, he said. “I think — no, I know — that you guys had as much fun as we have doing this,” he said.

weekly! John Newby, Pineville, Missouri, is a nationally recognized publisher, community, business & media consultant, and speaker. He authors “Building Main Street, not Wall Street,” a column appearing in 60+ communities. His email is: info@Truly-Localllc.com. A great business mind, Harvard Business School Dean Clayton Christiansen once said, “The reason why it is so difficult for existing businesses (and communities) to capitalize on disruptive innovations is that their processes and their business model that make them good at the existing business model actually make them bad at competing for the disruption.” Couple this statement with an article I recently read in Forbes, and you have the recipe for disaster looming in many local communities. The article in Forbes was encouraging and showing their readers how to take advantage of shopping online via ecommerce. While it touted Amazon and all their Wall Street friends, it left out any reference to local community markets. If this was a one-off piece, one could ignore it as an oversight, but unfortunately, that is not the case. I have seen and read similar pieces in Bloomberg, Reuters, AP and countless other mainstream media sources, imploring their readers to spend their money with all their Wall Street cronies. Make no mistake, when I selected the column title, “Building Main Street, not Wall Street”, it was for a very distinct reason. Communities can’t build Main Street while being pummeled by Wall Street. While intentional or not, Wall Street is coming after every dollar from your community they can get their hands on. The pressure from their shareholders is only increasing. This ecommerce attack will spell disaster for many local communities across the country. Don’t think for one minute that big government with sweetheart deals from Wall Street lobbyists will come to your rescue. As the recent lockdowns have shown, by in large, local businesses are forced to shutter their doors while the Wall Street and corporately owned businesses continue to stay open, and in most cases, thrive. The real kicker is many local governments just blindly follow this path unknowingly destroying their local business base while becoming a major exporter of their local dollars to Wall Street. Communities and their media partners must view this as war, rest assured, your opponent on Wall Street does. What can local communities do in light of the assault on their local base? First, any sustainable community initiative needs to be led from the top. Community leaders must lead, and they must act now. By community leaders, this means city leaders, business leaders, the chamber, civic clubs or organizations and other city influencers. They need to convene a special meeting with saving local businesses as the sole topic and begin to strategize their path forward for local business. Secondly, this leadership needs to come up with community wide initiatives to assist locally-owned businesses. At this point, it may prove difficult to enact something that is effective by the Christmas shopping season, but getting the process started is a must. Always remember, even if you fall a bit short, anything will help. Thirdly, if you can’t act by the traditional shopping season, don’t fret. The initiatives you should be employing need to be year-long efforts, not just a token “Shop Small Saturday” or “Christmas Bucks” type of program. Those programs are a start, but won’t do a thing to build loyalty, habit, and long-term sustainable shopping patterns throughout your community. Think year-long promotions, incentives, games, contests and so forth. This is where a solid partnership with your local news-media company can build synergies and foundational support. Lastly, don’t be afraid to reach out for help. There are many communities that have done some outstanding things in support of their local business base, most are more than willing to share. In fact, simply send me an email and I will provide many ideas, suggestions and thoughts to get you started. The key to success is to get started. Commit that your community is going to answer the battle cry and not succumb to inaction and lack of initiative. Anyone can lead during the good times; the mark of great leaders are those leaders that step-up during the tough times and lead. Six-time MVP Michael Jordon always wanted the ball when the game was on the line, he was willing to carry the team when they needed him the most.

People can pick them up there, free of charge. They also have some in Clarkson at the Cenex C-Store. As of July 23, Evert said all of the locations are out but are expected to be resupplied. Evert said she is extremely proud of the kids. “Mr. Severson is teaching them how to volunteer, that you don’t need to be paid for everything,” she added. Masks and handwashing are extremely important, she said, along with social distancing. “When you wear a mask you’re protecting yourself but you’re also protecting the other person,” she said. Evert noted that they have received donations for the project as well. “The Department of Utilities here in Schuyler gave me a large check for donations to buy material, because I have people who can sew, I just needed the material,” Evert said. She dropped the material off at the school when she saw Severson’s picture. “We’ve handed out probably five to 700 in a four-month time frame,” she said. “We’ve gotten some from the state."" Evert said the organization Nebraska Impact sent her 200 masks and that since they were in a hot spot they basically just asked how many they wanted. “We’ve handed out probably five to 700 in a four month time frame,” she said. “We’ve gotten some from the state.""

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 8:36 pm Crime and courts reporter The driver in a single-vehicle crash at Heartwell Park that killed a 37-year-old Grand Island man has been charged in Adams County Court. Ashley Woitaszewski, 28, of Shelton was charged Wednesday with motor vehicle homicide while driving under the influence of alcohol, a Class 2A felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Adams County Judge Michael Burns set a personal recognizance bond of $25,000 and scheduled a preliminary hearing for Oct. 21 at 10:30 a.m. Mark Porto, a Grand Island lawyer, is representing Woitaszewski. According to the arrest affidavit, Woitaszewski was the driver of a black Ford F350 that crashed in Heartwell Park on Aug. 6. The vehicle reportedly was northbound on Cedar Avenue about 1:39 a.m. when it went through a grassy area in the park and struck a retaining wall on the north side of the creek that runs through the park. Derek A. Lindstrom, 37, who was seated on the rear floor of the crew cab pickup, died in the crash. Woitaszewski and a passenger in the front seat, Nicholas Montague, 42, of 1220 N. Kansas Ave., were admitted at Mary Lanning Healthcare and later discharged. Investigators found tire marks believed to be created by the truck starting at Ninth Street and leading north on Cedar Avenue. Cedar Avenue is a 25 mph residential zone, but the crash retrieval data from the vehicle showed the vehicle speed at 44 mph at the time the air bags were deployed. In the five seconds before the crash, the highest speed recorded was 60 mph. Officers found tire impressions in the grass leading up the crash, but noted a 48-foot gap between the sidewalk and the impressions, indicating the truck was airborne for that distance. Woitaszewski provided a blood sample at the hospital following the crash and the results indicated a blood alcohol content of .12g/100ml, which is higher than the legal limit of .08 in Nebraska.
