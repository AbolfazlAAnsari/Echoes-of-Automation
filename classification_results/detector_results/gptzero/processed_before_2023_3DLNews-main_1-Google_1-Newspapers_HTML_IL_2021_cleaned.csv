Here’s what representatives said they’re planning to do this year. Hailee O’Dell: President of Student Government O’Dell, a junior psychology major from Glen Carbon, Illinois, said her main job as president is to build great leaders within Student Government. “[COVID-19] kind of brought down the norm of what Student Government was, so [we have been trying] to build that back up for a post-[COVID-19] year. Students are really excited to be back on campus, so we’ve got quite the year ahead of us with all of that, getting students involved again while maintaining a safe environment for the students on campus,” O’Dell said. O’Dell also said she has personal initiatives in addition to her initiatives as president. “Some of my personal initiatives are working with one of our senators on a syllabus base, so you can see the syllabus of your classes before you register for them, as well as working with student employment on summer employment for students who aren’t enrolled in classes. Dining Services and the Fitness Center see a big hit from that whenever students have to leave, so working with them on that to see if we can do anything about it,” O’Dell said. “There’s more, but that’s what I’m working on right now. But mostly just building really great leaders within Student Government and maintaining good morale.” Holley Hentz: Senator of CAS for Peoples and Cultures Hentz, a junior criminal justice major with an emphasis in pre-law from Alton, Illinois, said what she hopes to accomplish in Student Government is to make SIUE a safe campus for a diverse population of students. “My first initiative that I’m trying to make happen is self defense classes, hopefully more often than just the semesterly ones held by the police here on campus,” Hentz said. “And I’d just like to make it a lot more inclusive for [the] LGBTQ community and for people of color and for disadvantaged people, so hopefully we’ll get some scholarships going and just some really fun events to promote diversity and inclusivity.” Mackenzie Richards: Senator at Large Richards, a sophomore psychology major from Granite City, Illinois, said she wants to focus on sustainability, as well as diversity and inclusivity on campus. “Also making sure that everything is still accessible and fun and safe for everyone with events and everything going on,” Richards said. “With [COVID-19], I want everyone to feel very included on campus and make them feel very safe.” Alexia Burnett: Senator for the School of Nursing Burnett, a junior nursing major from Shelbyville, Illinois, said her goal is to get nursing students more involved on campus and reduce their stress. So far, she has started an influx prep night to prepare for the NCLEX exam. She said she is also looking into doing a mentorship program similar to Cougar Connectors, a peer-to-peer mentoring program where freshman are paired with upperclassmen. “We talked about maybe doing a movie night, and then we also have talked about doing … like Cougar Connectors. We’ve talked about doing something similar within the nursing program, so freshmen nursing students will be paired up with underclassmen nursing students. I feel like it’s important because if your Cougar Connector isn’t a nursing student, they’re not going to be able to help you,” Burnett said. “So we’re talking about doing something like that, and we’ve also talked about doing sensitivity training for the faculty and staff over there because recently it’s been brought to our attention that it needs to be done.” Burnett said she is waiting on an email server list to start implementing her plans, which she hopes to accomplish through sending surveys and weekly emails to other nursing students. “I know that they’re busy, with me being a nursing student,” Burnett said. “But I hope to get them weekly emails to remind them, ‘Hey, this week there’s these events going on.’ But it really is reliant on me getting [that] email server list.” Lifestyles Editor Log In Keep it Clean.

Opened in 2014, the event space aims not just to transform the lives of those who attend its gatherings and utilize its services, but gradually, 75th Street and South Shore as a whole. “We call South Shore the Cultural Soul Coast,” said Quarry owner Yvette Moyo. “And our goal is to touch the cultural soul of the individuals who come here.” But closures induced by COVID-19 have severely affected The Quarry’s financial situation. Four small businesses, ranging from graphic design services to an investment group, used to rent office space within the building, but vacated after the pandemic began. They haven’t yet returned. Attendance at the Quarry’s usual Friday Night Jazz has also had to be curtailed, in line with state guidelines regulating the capacity of indoor spaces. The reduced revenues from these two have made it harder for The Quarry to keep up with their property taxes, some of them backdated, which have mounted to nearly $70,000, said Moyo. Still, Moyo remains optimistic, launching a GoFundMe campaign to help recoup the debt. She said that the Jazz nights, headlined and managed by South Side vibraphonist Thaddeus Tukes, have regularly and quickly sold out since reopening. Some of the changes The Quarry adopted during the pandemic have also become permanent features of the organization. Moyo said that the Quarry “pivoted to becoming a food stability center” in response to COVID-19, serving first as a food pantry, then a mobile food delivery team, and then, in September of 2020, as a free breakfast center for families in the neighborhood. “There were so many kids who counted on the free breakfast from school, and who needed a replacement,” Moyo said, “So we took a page from the Black Panthers, and started serving it.” The meals are served schooldays from 7:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. and are prepared in the Quarry’s shared kitchen space, currently anchored by chef Arel Ben Israel. Israel is the co-owner of the Soul Veg City restaurant, which also serves vegan soul food from steam tables in one of the Quarry’s main rooms. Adjacent to the restaurant take-out area is a long corridor that usually features rotating works from local artists. But because of COVID-19, Moyo said, many of the paintings have been temporarily returned to their creators, to be replaced by the items from her personal collection. In the same corridor is the Quarry's gift shop, its office spaces, and an archive containing seven years of the South Shore Current (which Moyo formerly co-published and which is now published by Lisa Dawn Taylor), as well as Moyo's new magazine, The South Side Drive. Featuring work from a range of South Side writers, the South Side Drive offers health and wellness advice and documents the stories of South Shore notables. Facing the magazine archives is the Quarry’s spacious ballroom, where they host concerts, as well as yoga and wellness sessions for young men (especially fathers). Moyo explained that her history within the advertising industry has been crucial in building out The Quarry. She said her marketing work and her work at The Quarry served as an extension of her lifelong goal to “expose and celebrate the beauty and value of Black people.” Connections in her time advertising the US Postal Service allowed her to obtain prints for The Quarry from Synthia Saint James, who designed the first Kwanzaa Stamp, as well as funding for the organization. Moyo first moved to South Shore in 1964 at the age of ten, and has lived in the neighborhood off and on for the rest of her life. She recalled how, in her childhood, it was too dangerous for Black people to cross east of South Yates Boulevard to swim at Rainbow Beach. As the area became less segregated, she also fondly remembers a 75th Street on which more Black-owned small businesses flourished. When she returned to 75th Street nine years ago, she was dismayed at the state of shuttered businesses and violence. Moyo said, “When I moved back here, this strip was called ‘Terror Town’ and it was one of the most notorious streets for violence. I was appalled. Literary culture, and music and performance have always been a part of my life, and to see all that snuffed out by absentee landlords, really, has just been terrible. They hold onto property so that people who want to do something with these storefronts can’t even figure out how to get to them.” According to the South Side Weekly, South Shore has lost nearly 12,000 African American residents since 1990; the neighborhood also experienced huge decreases in homeownership following the 2008 foreclosure crisis. According to the Metropolitan Planning Council, it also lost more downtown jobs than any other neighborhood between 2010 and 2014. For decades, city officials chose predominantly to invest in Chicago’s downtown instead of other neighborhoods, hurting areas like South Shore. Moyo began volunteering at The Quarry in order to fight these downward trends. She said, “My goal was to not have another South Shore business shutter.” When former owner Ernest Armstrong passed away in 2015, Moyo said she took the business over, working with Ernest’s wife Susanne Armstrong and funding it with her personal income. Since assuming ownership, Moyo has helped The Quarry secure numerous grants for repairs, and brought it under the umbrella organization Real Men Charities, which Moyo co-founded. “One of my proudest moments,” said Moyo, “came when we were distributing food. Cars were coming up here to pick up food, and somebody said, ‘This is the corner of love.’ And I just thought to myself, ‘Wow, from terror town to the corner of love.’” Donate to the Quarry's fundraiser at gofundme.com/f/dv4ag-save-the-quarry.

But the conservative-leaning network has fallen behind CNN and MSNBC since election day, as more viewers have tuned in to those networks to follow the transition of the new Democratic administration and the aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol led by pro-Trump rioters.Fox News is also seeing some of its viewers sample upstart right-wing TV outlet Newsmax. While the Newsmax audience is a fraction of what Fox News draws, the network does see a pronounced audience lift at 7 p.m. Eastern for its host Greg Kelly, who remains a rabid Trump defender even after the Capitol riots.A Fox News representative had previously stated the program changes were under discussion since the early fall and are not a response to the recent ratings trends. Fox News did have opinion programming in the 7 p.m. hour in 2016, when Carlson was first given a daily program. Carlson eventually moved to prime time after the departure of Bill O’Reilly and is now the network’s most-watched host.The Fox News research department’s analysis of Nielsen data since election day shows the bulk of disaffected Fox News viewers — many of them Trump fans disappointed over the election results — have gone to entertainment programs and are taking a break from the news.The hosts for “Fox News Primetime” are not permanent. But it’s likely that whichever one catches on with the audience could get the job full time.Bartiromo’s inclusion on the host list indicates she could be moving to the network’s opinion side. While she told the Times in an interview last month that she considers herself a news anchor, her Sunday program has a strong pro-Trump bent, especially in the weeks after the election when she gave the president’s attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell free rein to spew falsehoods and conspiracy theories about election fraud.Bartiromo was among the Fox News hosts forced to air a fact check disputing many of the president’s lawyers’ claims about voting software company Smartmatic, falsely stating it was involved in delivering Trump votes to Biden. Smartmatic is considering a defamation suit against Fox News and other conservative outlets over the matter.Gowdy has been a Fox News contributor since 2018. A former federal prosecutor, he served in Congress from 2010 to 2018 and led the House sub-committee that investigated the 2012 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four people.Campos-Duffy is a Fox News contributor and a former guest co-host of ABC’s daytime talk program “The View.” She got her start in TV as a cast member on the MTV reality show “The Real World.”Steyn is a conservative Canadian author who has appeared as a frequent guest and fill-in host for Carlson. He has also been a fill-in host for Rush Limbaugh’s radio program.Pavlich is a conservative blogger and has been a frequent commentator on Fox News programs since 2013. The new show called “Fox News Primetime” launches Monday with “Fox & Friends” morning show co-host Brian Kilmeade, as previously announced. The Times has learned that other names lined up to helm the program are “Sunday Morning Futures” host Maria Bartiromo and regular contributors to the network Katie Pavlich, Rachel Campos-Duffy, Mark Steyn and former congressman Trey Gowdy. A Fox News representative confirmed the upcoming hosts. The program is being launched as Fox News shakes up its lineup as it prepares to cover the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden and the Republican Party in the post-Trump era.

important local and national news sent to your email inbox daily. Just a few days after Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued a shelter-at-home order, my neighbors got together outdoors to wring our hands together. Barb Ickes reporter Quad-City Times / Dispatch-Argus Editor We didn't know what hit us. The calendar on my desk at work is frozen in time — March 20, 2020. One day soon, when I'm finally back in the office, the untouched calendar pages from the last year will go into the recycle bin. A day later, March 21, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Scott County. A day after that, the first case was confirmed in Rock Island County. When the pandemic hit, I compared it in a column to the days after 9/11. There were no airplanes in the sky or cars on the streets, and the silence unnerved us nearly as much as the fear and anxiety that loomed as large as the fallen towers. Five days after Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker ordered us to shelter in place, a bunch of my neighbors dragged chairs, coolers and a couple of guitars into our cul-de-sac and wondered together what might come next. It was good medicine, sharing our worries. Some guessed it would be a few months before things got back to normal. Others guessed it would be longer. None of us had the stomach to speculate on how many of us might be stricken. So much of it is a blur now. For many of us in news, the coronavirus consumed our work lives as vigorously as it consumed what remained of our personal lives. So, we have a thorough written record of the year, but I sure don't have the interest in looking back; at least I don't right now. If looking for an upshot, millions of us survived. But some of us weren't always keen on doing so. We had to dig deep. Three things will stay with me long after it's over. First, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police. We are nowhere near reaching the threshold of awareness and change that must confront the racial realities in this country. Secondly, the derecho. When the wind got scary, I went to the basement with a flashlight and the cats. I crept up the stairs every few minutes to peek out a window. Somewhere near the end of the freakishly long storm, a large oak tree slammed against my house with a loud, shaking thud. I was sure I would emerge from the basement to see sky where my roof had been. But the house was largely spared. A new roof and repairs to the crushed patio were an almost-welcome inconvenience, given what could have been. A strong wind still puts me on edge, but I've covered enough tornadoes to clearly recognize how lucky I was. The third mark of 2020 is the hardest of all. In September, our dad took a fall and struck his head. An ambulance came, and Dad was told he should go to the hospital. But he didn't want to go. He knew, because of COVID-19, we wouldn't be allowed to go with him. Already suffering the effects of Parkinson's disease, he just didn't want to be alone. It took until November to realize the blow to his head had resulted in a slow bleed. At one point, the bleeding had stopped, but it started again and he was having stroke-like symptoms. I took him to the emergency room, and he was admitted to the hospital. A surgeon tried to evacuate the blood, but Dad was in a bad way. He didn't want anything more done. We made arrangements with hospice and brought Dad home. Mom had been the love of his life and his wife for nearly 64 years. She barely left his side. The four of us daughters stuck close, too, and the grandkids came. Over and over, we told him we love him. A couple of us sang softly to the Frank Sinatra lyrics we could remember, and I promised I will take him with me everywhere I go for the rest of my life. We wept in silent bursts and sobbed in heaving sorrow. When he left us, it was like re-emerging from the basement, except the house was really gone this time. The last four months have been the saddest and most difficult of our lives for some in my family. The loneliness of loss has been cruelly exaggerated by the isolation of the pandemic. As we turn the corner toward a vaccinated nation and a return to whatever was normal, many of us are incomplete families. At least a half-million people succumbed to the coronavirus, and I have an unfortunate idea about how they feel. I regret the hours Dad endured alone in the hospital when the pandemic restrictions kept us away. I resent the anti-maskers whose selfishness prolonged the virus. As I look back on the past year, I do so with an unlikely combination of profound grief and unwavering gratitude. So much could have been worse. We are making social strides. Future generations will read about us — how we conducted ourselves and what we endured. As with every moment in history, ours has changed us, for better and worse. The CDC says the risk of complications or death due to Covid-19 rises for those with high BMI or obesity. Veuer’s Elizabeth Keatinge has more. Scott County confirmed the first case of the novel coronavirus in the Quad-Cities on March 21, 2020. A day later, Rock Island County confirmed its first case. Since then more than 31,000 Quad-Citians have contracted the virus, and 529 have died. This week, we'll take a look back at COVID in the Quad-Cities.

The United States Supreme Court denied the petition from Protect Our Parks in its case against the city and Chicago Park District over the construction of the Obama Presidential Center (OPC) in Jackson Park. Supreme Court Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who authored the circuit court opinion that POP appealed, did not “take part in the consideration of the petition,” according to the court’s order, which was issued on Monday, April 26. The 2018 case primarily dealt with issues of public trust doctrine around the transfer of parkland from the city to the Obama Foundation, the nonprofit responsible for the construction of the OPC. The case had been winding its way through the appeals process since the summer of 2019, when a district court found in favor of the city and Park District. POP president Herb Caplan said the decision was “disappointing,” though not unexpected. (The city declined comment. The Chicago Park District did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) “Because of the uncertainty involved in Petitions for Certiorari it has never been part of our advance planning,” Caplan said. “The next step has always been to follow the directions outlined by the 7th Circuit opinion that was entered and file a new Complaint in federal and state courts to deal directly with the issues of standing to sue and Article III jurisdiction.” Caplan said the group had not yet determined when it would file a new case. In the meantime, it has another lawsuit in the works alleging that various government agencies mishandled the federal reviews that made up an integral part of the OPC approval process. Reached by the Herald, a spokesperson for the Obama Foundation said, ""We are pleased with the decision and continue to eagerly look ahead to a groundbreaking in the second half of this year."" On April 14, the city kicked off preparatory work in Jackson Park ahead of the construction of the OPC. Last week, the Obama Foundation announced the beginning of a $400 million fundraising campaign to finance the project. A groundbreaking is expected in August. Marc Monaghan contributed reporting. Editor Considering the make-up of the Court is decidedly right wing- Amy Barrett? - you can\'t be too surprised.

There are environmental impact statements, and federally mandated reviews. Those reviews were not legally conducted, and there has been No environmental impact statement.A section 106 review supposedly provides three methods to limit impact: avoidance, minimizing, and finally \'mitigation\'.

Theater is especially Eurocentric, said Guyton – its origins are credited to the Greeks. Newer works, like the 2015 musical Hamilton, help de-center this perspective and broaden audiences, he said. The musical features performers of color, hip-hop and other modern genres to tell the story of the first U.S. treasurer. Guyton spoke as part of an April 5 panel hosted by the University of Illinois Springfield (UIS) about the intersection of racial equality and the arts. He said leaders in the field should have ongoing relationships with diverse audiences to create inclusive performance art pieces. ""Ballet is seen by many as the epitome of dance in American culture,"" said Tiffani Saunders during the panel. She is a UIS African American studies professor and was recently elected to the Chatham public school board. She said she\'d like people to consider jazz, Indigenous and tap dance as American dance styles with as much value as ballet. When ""classic"" is elitist Despite being introduced to ""classical"" violin and dance training as a child, Saunders hadn\'t questioned what the term ""classical"" signaled in performance art until later in her adult life. As a professor, she decided to build a class based on that question. Dance is a cultural product. It is shaped by class, gender, ethnicity and tradition. And because of this, Saunders said, ballet ""should be understood as an ethnic or folk dance of Europe."" She also teaches about the ways dances and music have been used in history. Tap dance, for example, was an encrypted way for enslaved people to communicate. Jazz dance and music are rooted in African American spirituals and celebratory traditions. Acknowledging and valuing this history helps build a picture of American performing arts that is more inclusive than it has traditionally been, said Saunders. While ballet is a European dance originating in the courts of kings and queens, there are other forms of dance that can be considered classic American forms. Saunders said in most schools the roots and utility of different kinds of performing arts like jazz or Indigenous dances are unfortunately ""undiscussed and unexamined."" The roots of music and dance genres have been all but ignored, especially in how we think about and teach dance in America. That says a lot about how race functions, according to Saunders. Recommendations During the panel, Guyton talked about his experiences as a Black community actor and focused on issues directors and arts organizations can ponder, like, how to build authentic relationships with the communities they want to serve. Guyton said leaders should also think about the level of interaction between their organizations and marginalized communities, as well as turnout for auditions and events. He also suggested those spearheading projects should consider audience and participant age, race and gender, and whether an audience reflects a community\'s makeup. Guyton said the cost of attending and participating in productions can exclude people from certain identities. Offering discounts, prime seating and help with transportation can ensure a program is cast and presented in an equitable fashion. He also urged art directors and boards to consider barriers to participation or attendance, such as access to child care. ""When you give artists of color the ability to dream, they\'re able to visualize and produce content,"" said Guyton. When you give them the tools, access and space to also invite family, friends and communities, the outcome can be genuinely inclusive, Guyton said. Making these considerations, particularly before casting, promotes inclusion and can expand audiences.

Svehla / Pioneer Press Hinsdale Central's Sean Allison watches the action during a game against Proviso West in Hinsdale on Friday, Oct. 15, 2021. When Hinsdale Central was looking for some help at running back early this season, senior Sean Allison didn’t hesitate to volunteer.Allison had played exclusively on defense in high school as a safety, a linebacker and a hybrid called the rover.But he was ready to jump in on offense.“I played running back when I was younger,” Allison said. “We’re thin on running backs this year, and the coaches asked who could play there. I threw my name out there. I know I’m an athlete and I can compete. I’m a big running back who can use my strength in those short-yardage situations.”Allison has found success in the new role. His biggest moment came in the Red Devils’ 27-23 win against York on Oct. 8, when he ran for the game-winning 4-yard touchdown with 1:30 left.Meanwhile, he continued to lead Hinsdale Central’s defense during an eight-game winning streak.“The season’s been going great,” Allison said. “We started out with a tough loss against Naperville Central in the first week of the season, but we’ve definitely bounced back.“We have a lot of inexperienced juniors playing, and we’re a pretty young team. So I think that first game was just some growing pains. But we got it back on the railroad tracks. We’ve got great chemistry, and everything’s going good on both sides of the ball.” Allison hopes for a long playoff run to keep his Hinsdale Central career going.“I think about it every day in practice,” he said. “You never know when that last game will come. The goal is obviously state, so we’re hoping to have several more weeks left. I’m definitely looking forward to making a run in the playoffs, and I hope my senior season just keeps going.” Hinsdale Central’s Sean Allison, shown during a game against Proviso West in Hinsdale on Friday, Oct. 15, 2021, plays a hybrid role on defense called the rover.Maximum versatilityThe rover position gives Allison the chance to showcase his variety of skills.“It’s like a safety/outside linebacker combination,” he said. “I like it a lot because I get to do both. I can get up there in the middle on the running backs, and I can also drop back into coverage and play the pass.“I think that’s what makes me such a great player is being able to do both and being able to play any position on the defense that I need to play.”Allison has been able to put the knowledge he has picked up from past roles into use.“From younger ages, I’ve played safety my entire life,” he said. “Sophomore year, when I moved up to varsity, I played outside linebacker. Then with the spring season and this year, I’m playing this best-of-both-worlds hybrid spot.”Allison’s comfort level in what he has to do allows him to spend more time thinking about what his teammates should be doing.“We were in a situation where we had four new starters in the secondary this season,” Hinsdale Central coach Brian Griffin said. “Sean runs the show defensively. Everyone relies on him to get us to the line and get them where they’re supposed to go, and he does a phenomenal job with that. As somebody with the experience that he has, he’s taken that role and ran with it.”Speaking of running with things, Griffin has been impressed by how Allison has carried the ball.“We had some needs at running back, and he’s stepped into that role and done a great job,” Griffin said. “He’s picked up the offense quickly to be ready to go in any situation. It’s been huge, to the point where he’s in there at the end of the game (against York) when we need a touchdown, and he scores a huge touchdown for us.“Those sorts of things come from preparation and hard work, and he does all those things.” Hinsdale Central’s Sean Allison, left, avoids tackles to pick up extra yards during a game against Proviso West in Hinsdale on Friday, Oct. 15, 2021.Allison has enjoyed his time at running back.“It’s been fun,” he said. “I played a little offense when I was younger, but nothing too much in high school. It’s been fun to hit people on the defensive side of the ball and then go deliver some hits on the offensive side too.”Picking up the offense has been a smooth learning process for him.“It’s just practice and getting those reps in and going through the plays with my quarterback, Billy (Cernugel), and getting that chemistry with him,” Allison said. “Then it’s flipping the switch from defense to offense.“I get a little gassed out there playing both sides. But it’s always fun to score some touchdowns and run over some people.”Against Hinsdale South on Sept. 17, Allison got three carries and scored two touchdowns. His usage in the running game picked up after that. He ran for 86 yards on 14 carries against Oak Park-River Forest and finished with 86 yards rushing, including that huge touchdown, in the win against York.‘Genius on the football field’As one of Hinsdale Central’s most experienced players, Allison knows his teammates look to him for advice and support. That’s yet another role he embraces.“Being a senior is huge,” Allison said. “Being a leader goes along with being a captain. It’s using all my experience and the things I’ve learned, knowing how adversity happens.“I want to help the juniors and even some sophomores that are on our varsity team get through it and make sure they stay positive if they mess up and make mistakes. They need to keep their heads up.”Griffin appreciates the way Allison helps his teammates.“He coaches up his backup, he helps kids get aligned, he holds them accountable when they make mistakes,” Griffin said. “He does all those things that you want a senior captain to do.”Junior Max Williams has been moved to the rover position this season as Allison’s backup.“I’ve learned a lot from him,” Williams said. “He’s like a genius on the football field. He knows everything. He knows how to do everything perfectly out there.“I started at linebacker and moved to rover, where he’s been playing. It was a weird adjustment, but he’s basically taught me everything that I need to do. I continue to learn from him and get better. He gives me tips at almost every practice.” Hinsdale Central’s Sean Allison, left, celebrates a touchdown with teammate Reece Kolke during a game against Proviso West in Hinsdale on Friday, Oct. 15, 2021.Williams sees Allison guiding other teammates in similar ways.“He’s a great leader,” Williams said. “It’s not only me that he’s helping, but it’s the team as a whole. He gets everyone motivated and keeps everyone on track and makes sure they’re all doing their job.”As a young player, Allison recognized the importance of preparation. He’s a film junkie.“Since sophomore year, I’ve definitely become a better player,” he said. “I think my football intelligence level is the biggest thing. Watching film is a big part of that. I love watching film. Me and my dad (Chris) will always watch film together.“Then it was just learning from the older guys. Sophomore year, I played with a lot of great football players and leaders. Being under their wing and learning what they do has helped a lot, and I try to pass that on to the younger kids.”Family traditionAllison’s father played college football at Northern Michigan, and the two have always bonded over the sport.“His love for the game went right to me, and I love everything about it,” Allison said. “Especially during the fall, it’s all we talk about, really. It’s watching film, talking about how practice went and all of that. He really knows the game, and he helps my football IQ level.”Allison recently received an offer from Valparaiso.“The recruiting process has been going pretty good for me lately,” he said. “It was definitely a lot slower than I expected coming into the summer. COVID kind of delayed everything.“But I have been picking up some interest from Valparaiso, Dayton, Drake, Colgate, Lehigh — schools like that. I’ve got some game-day""}]"

He added: ""This fight is far from over. Though we celebrate today’s news, I urge all Americans — keep washing your hands, stay socially distanced, and keep wearing masks. As I have said many times, things are still likely to get worse again as new variants spread, and the current improvement could reverse."" Dr. Richard Besser, president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, applauded the FDA\'s decision but cautioned against complacency. ""With three COVID-19 vaccines now available, the number of cases and deaths around the country continuing to fall, and Congress taking steps toward approving additional critically needed economic relief, I have never been more encouraged that we might be finally turning the corner on this pandemic,"" he said in a statement. Besser also said increases in vaccine supply ""are welcome but insufficient on their own to end"" the racial disparities in vaccine distribution. ""People of color in the United States have suffered a cruel dichotomy: among the highest rates of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, and among the lowest rates of vaccination."" The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines appear to be more effective than J&J\'s vaccine, showing better than 94% effectiveness in large trials they ran last year. Although the vaccines can\'t be compared directly, because the trials were conducted at different times, J&J\'s vaccine appeared to be 72% effective among U.S. trial participants. It was less effective in South Africa and Latin America, where newer strains of the virus are circulating. A side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine can mimic a sign of breast cancer: This is normal, doctors say The one-shot J&J vaccine also should be easier to distribute to rural areas and other places without pharmaceutical-grade freezers, because it can be stored for longer in a refrigerator. And it may cause fewer side effects than the other two vaccines, with only about 50% of trial participants reporting injection-site pain compared to nearly 80% for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, particularly with second shots. The company will offer trial participants who received the placebo an active vaccine and will continue to follow them for two years. The government has several safety monitoring systems to keep track of any health problems connected to the shots. An advisory committee to the CDC will meet Sunday and Monday to discuss how the J&J vaccine should be used. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, head of the CDC, will then review the vaccine, and it should be ready for distribution early next week.

Brian O’Mahoney / News-Sun Lake Forest doubles partners Lainey O'Neil, left, and Isabelle Chong, shown during the Class 2A Stevenson Sectional on Saturday, Oct. 17, 2020, won the Class 2A state title in October. Lake Forest doubles partners Lainey O’Neil and Isabelle Chong went undefeated during the abbreviated 2020 season but had no chance to see what they could do at the state level.So after the Illinois High School Association canceled the 2020 finals due to the coronavirus pandemic, O’Neil and Chong were particularly motivated as they headed to state as the top seed in Class 2A last month.“It meant so much,” O’Neil said. “We have been playing together for two years now. We’ve been working really hard together. We’ve done a lot of practicing outside of high school tennis because we wanted to win so badly. We didn’t have state last year, so that made this year more special.”O’Neil, a junior, and Chong, a sophomore, went undefeated again. This time, they capped off a 36-0 season with a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 win over Hinsdale Central’s Sophia Kim and Katie Dollens on Oct. 23 to win the Class 2A doubles state championship.“It’s an amazing feeling,” Chong said. “After we lost the first set in the championship match, it was tough. But we just told each other, ‘We’re not going to lose this.'” Lake Forest’s Isabelle Chong plays in the doubles semifinal match during the Class 2A Stevenson Sectional on Saturday, Oct. 17, 2020.Their performance, along with junior Autumn Rabjohns’ runner-up finish in singles, helped Lake Forest tie for second as a team.Hinsdale Central won the team championship with 34 points, while Lake Forest, Stevenson and New Trier all tied for second with 26.It was an unlikely finish for the Scouts, who had just the two entries at state. “I’m over the moon,” Lake Forest coach Denise Murphy said. “It was a super special state tournament. I’ve been coaching over 15 years, and I’ve never had that happen before where we had someone in the finals in singles and doubles.“Then to have our doubles team win it was amazing. Lainey and Isabelle just rocked it. I wish Autumn could have taken it, but what a fantastic job she did coming in second.”O’Neil and Chong had to rally from a set down twice, starting with a tight third-round win over Fremd’s Gracie Ha and Sonal Matta. They had to survive a second-set tiebreaker as well, winning 4-6, 7-6, 6-4. Lake Forest’s Lainey O’Neil eyes the ball during a doubles semifinal in the Class 2A Stevenson Sectional on Saturday, Oct. 17, 2020.“In the third round, we had a very close match with a strong team from Fremd,” O’Neil said. “It was very unexpected. After that match, it was kind of a wake-up call knowing that since we’re the No. 1 seed, everyone’s trying to beat you. You have to make sure you’re dialed in at all times.”Kim and Dollens also entered the championship match undefeated.“The match was kind of two years in the making,” O’Neil said. “We wanted to play each other last season, but it never happened. That added to the excitement.“I was super nervous at first. I was making too many mistakes. The crowd was kind of bothering me. The whole Hinsdale Central student section was super loud and into it. I knew I needed to relax and tune out all the noise and do what I’ve been doing all year. Isabelle helped me calm down. We started making less mistakes, and it turned out well.”O’Neil and Chong were both primarily singles players before teaming up last season. It has worked out quite well.“I think we’re strongest when she’s at the base line and I’m at the net,” O’Neil said. “Her ground shots are so powerful and so strong, and she can out-rally anyone. I’m able to make those plays at the net.“We communicate so well now after all this time playing together.”The pair loved the feeling of winning a championship for their school.“When I first came back to school, all my teachers said congratulations,” Chong said. “We got a banner in front of the school, and our names were announced. They’re going to say our names at halftime of a football game, so we’ll be on the field for that. It all means a lot.”There’s a chance to do it again next season.“It’s very exciting because me and Lainey want to defend our doubles title,” Chong said. “Hopefully we can win again next year.”Steve Millar is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press.

The Reimagine Public Safety Act became law in June, but the expansion signed Friday clarifies guidelines in the original bill and gives the Illinois Department of Human Services and a newly created Office of Firearm Violence Prevention greater grant making flexibility. The crux of the RPSA is that it creates the Office of Firearm Violence Prevention to coordinate violence prevention efforts and give grants to on-the-ground community organizations that know how and where intervention is needed in the state’s most violent communities. Heading that office is Chris Patterson, who was appointed by Pritzker as assistant secretary for violence prevention at IDHS.

The contracted organizations are to focus on programs such as youth intervention services, violence interruption and trauma treatment. Pritzker said applications are now open for groups that can help train community organizations that will deliver evidence-based violence interruption and prevention services. A notice of funding opportunity is available at https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=138882.

In November, Pritzker signed an executive order classifying gun violence as a public health crisis and expediting implementation of the Reimagine Public Safety Act. The bill was backed in the House and Senate by a pair of Chicago Democrats, Rep. Justin Slaughter and Sen. Robert Peters. Both have been active in some of the major criminal justice overhauls in recent years, including a bill that eliminates cash bail in Illinois beginning in 2023. “Leaders and members in our communities have been yelling for help for years, and at one point they were met with the deafening silence of a budget impasse and institutions and services closed,” Peters said. “For years, our approach to these struggles was built off of a system that I would call a form of big government gone bad called mass incarceration.” More: Application portal opens for new round of Illinois rental assistance The RPSA requires that the Office of Firearm Violence Prevention identify the 10 most violent Chicago neighborhoods with the first consideration being the number of shootings per capita. Then it is required to identify another seven of the most violent communities, based on the number of victims. The language in the follow-up bill signed Friday also allows the office to identify another five Chicago communities for grants as well. For neighborhoods outside of Chicago that have a population of more than 35,000, the office is tasked with identifying 10 of the most violent communities based on the same parameters. After those are identified, the office can direct grants to up to five more neighborhoods. The office is tasked with creating a formula for grant distribution and working with advisory councils in the identified communities. The bill states that “when possible” grant amounts should be of at least $300,000 per youth development organization. Slaughter said the problems facing Chicago and other communities in Illinois are similar to those nationwide.

Slaughter said the SAFE-T Act, which is the criminal justice reform bill passed in January’s lame duck session, contained two prongs of a three-pronged approach to criminal justice reforms backed by the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus – police and sentencing reforms. The Reimagine Public Safety Act represents the third prong, which is violence and crime prevention. “The Reimagine Public Safety Act signifies a different and new approach, one that is not necessarily soft or hard on crime, but rather a smart on crime,” he said. The bill signed Friday, House Bill 2791, passed the Senate 52-0 and the House 71-41. Republicans tried, to no avail, to push a series of sentence enhancements and other strict-on-crime criminal justice measures that ultimately failed to receive a hearing in either chamber. That GOP-backed package included a bill that would appropriate $100 million to the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board to fund grants to local departments for gang violence, carjacking and motor vehicle theft prevention, as well as officer staffing. The GOP, led by Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet, also pushed for measures eliminating good time sentence reductions for someone who brought a weapon to a penal institution or attacked a law officer.

A second such offense would come with a life sentence. Pritzker was asked about GOP opposition in the House on Friday, and he said Republicans “have only been calling for more time in prison for people.” “They've only been calling for cracking down and being, you know, just slogans around law and order,” he said. “What we do, what we Democrats have done, is actually invest in fighting crime and actually investing in our communities, investing in the community organizations that make a difference on the ground.” In other remarks at the news conference, Pritzker pointed to his efforts to double Illinois State Police patrols on Chicago’s expressways, to increase funding for the state police to add more troopers, and to build a new state police crime lab. He also pointed to a bill reforming the state’s Firearm Owners Identification Act.

At a July 13 virtual community meeting, a resident said that the project was intended for a commercial street and that the pending demolition of the house extends the reach of the project. “This is a very important conceptional line being crossed,” the resident said. The house is the first residential property on the west side of Kenneth, just to the south of the block-long development parcel on Irving Park. The residential property is being targeted for an underground stormwater retention tank, and the structural integrity of the house could be compromised if it were left there during the digging of a hole which is needed for the storage system’s installation, according to Northwestern officials. Plans also call for construction office trailers to be housed on the residential property during the project. Northwestern director of planning and construction Charles Cloutier said that the Northwestern did not purchase the house for the purposes of the underground stormwater system but that the city later expressed concern about using the alley behind the development site for underground infrastructure. “You’ll never know it was there,” Cloutier said of the tank. “It’s completely underground.” Cloutier added that after the construction of the project is completed, the residential lot could be used as a green space or small park and feedback from the community will be sought but that a new house will not be built there. Some residents questioned whether the site could be used for a commercial project given its RS-2 zoning, which is intended primarily for single-family homes, but Cloutier said that the city has indicated that the underground system can be installed there. A resident expressed dismay that Northwestern was building a “giant glass building in an historic neighborhood” and is now also being allowed to demolish a house on a residential street. The facility, which will include a parking garage, will measure about 320,000-square feet, with four levels above grade and two levels below grade. Other residents said that the architect of the house, which has a 3936 N. Kenneth Ave. address, also designed a nearby house on Tripp Avenue that is a Chicago landmark. The meeting was hosted by Alderman James Gardiner (45th) and was intended primarily to provide residents with a construction schedule for the project. Excavation is scheduled to start in August, with the building being ready for occupancy starting in the spring of 2023. In addition, two lanes of traffic in each direction on Irving Park will be maintained during the construction, and southbound traffic will be allowed on Kilbourn and northbound on Kenneth. All trees on the site (not including the parkway) will be removed given that the building will be from lot line to lot line. Some additional trees are planned for the parkway. At the end of the meeting, Gardiner said that “all concerns” will be addressed.
