In other text messages, Hunter described himself as both “a drunk” and “an addict.” Wise said that in addition to the text messages, Hunter in his memoir described buying and using drugs during four years of “active addiction.” OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma will not enforce any mandates from the World Health Organization, the United Nations and the World Economic Forum under a bill signed by Gov.

$95.3 billion foreign aid bill for Ukraine and Israel in a vote early Tuesday. The foreign aid package includes billions of dollars to support Ukraine and security aid to Israel, as well as humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine, among other priorities. It\'s unclear whether Johnson will hold a vote on the issue, and many House Republicans oppose continuing to provide more aid to Ukraine. The bill passed the Senate despite Johnson\'s criticism of the amendment and former President Donald Trump signaling his opposition to the bill, arguing that the US should end foreign aid unless it is in the form of loans. The Senate vote was 70-29, with 22 Republicans voting in favor, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. “History settles on all accounts,” McConnell said in a statement after the vote. “History will record that today, in the honor of American leadership and strength, the Senate did not bat an eyelid.” The bill includes $60 billion in support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia, $14.1 billion in security assistance to Israel, $9.2 billion in humanitarian aid and $4.8 billion in support of regional partners in the Indo-Pacific region, in addition to other policy provisions.

(Credit: SAID KHATIB/AFP via Getty Images) “The House has to find a way, and it has to do it its way, but we have to start the process, and we\'ve done that,” Senate Republican leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday. The Senate passed the legislation last week after Republicans blocked a broader bill that would have tied foreign aid to a bilateral border deal. Republicans had initially called for it to be part of a border security bill, but rejected a bipartisan border deal amid fierce attacks on the measure from Trump and top House Republicans. In a statement on Monday, Johnson criticized the foreign aid bill for its lack of border provisions, saying the Senate “should have gone back to the table to amend the current bill to include real border security provisions that would actually help.” An end to the current debacle”. Johnson had previously opposed a broader bill that included border regulations. Although the product of bipartisan negotiations and including restrictive border operations, the president described the provisions as insufficient. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer welcomed the passage of the legislation. Our allies, but the defense of Western democracy. “If President Johnson brings this bill to the House, I am confident it will pass with the same strong bipartisan support,” Schumer said. In opposition to the legislation, the Senate introduced the bill as Trump argued that the United States should not provide foreign aid solely through loans. Trump has also hinted at encouraging Russian aggression against NATO member states that do not pay their fair share. Several Senate Republicans either supported or downplayed Trump\'s comments on NATO on Monday. “I agree with him 100%,” Trump said of NATO members paying their dues or risking Putin invading their country. The Alabama Republican suggested European allies should be “very concerned” about an invasion, saying they should protect themselves and not rely on the United States, adding that the country “can\'t protect everyone.” Senate of Kansas. Roger Marshall said European allies concerned about Trump\'s comments should “get over it”. “You know, they\'ve got to get over it. They\'ve got to stand up and be tough. We\'ve got to protect our own border first. We\'ve got to take care of things here at home first. When we protect our own border, when we take care of our home, “Great. Let\'s help others,” he told the Kansas Republican Party. A Ukrainian infantryman in front-line trenches, in the Kreminna forest, Luhansk region, on January 31, 2024.

Audience member Cathy Cott asked two questions, the first on why State Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters was “bullying” school districts and referring to teachers as “terrorists.” “My second question is, why does the Legislature have such an obsession with the LGBTQ citizens of Oklahoma and what people do in their personal lives and how they raise their children?” Cott said. All four panelists answered the first part of Cott’s question, but passed over the second until Cott stood up and demanded an answer. “Is there a reason why you won’t answer about the 50 bills targeting the LGBTQ community in the state of Oklahoma? If you are ashamed of those bills, they shouldn’t be there,” Cott said. Cott pointed out that a 16-year-old had died earlier this month following a physical altercation at an Owasso High School. Cause of death has not yet been definitively established, though police said a preliminary report indicated a beating at the hands of other students didn’t kill Nex Benedict. After Hardin and Stephens responded, Woods said that while his “heart goes out” regarding the teen’s death, he represents a constituency. “We are a Republican state – supermajority – in the House and Senate. I represent a constituency that doesn’t want that filth in Oklahoma,” Woods said. Several audience members clapped at his statement, while others appeared shocked. “We are a religious state and we are going to fight it to keep that filth out of the state of Oklahoma because we are a Christian state – we are a moral state,” Woods said. “We want to lower taxes and let people be able to live and work and go to the faith they choose. We are a Republican state and I’m going to vote my district, and I’m going to vote my values, and we don’t want that in the state of Oklahoma.” Woods represents Adair County, plus parts of Cherokee, Sequoyah and Delaware counties. Hardin, who was the first to answer Cott’s question, said that while he hasn’t seen 50 bills targeting LGBTQ+ individuals, a few have gone through. “How you live your life personally, that’s between you and God. I have no judgment in that, but what goes through our public schools – I will fall back on my faith,” Hardin said. “I want to make sure that at least the children in our public schools have that faith ... what I want to make sure of is that our young children have the right to grow up with that faith, and if they choose to change it, that’s fine.” In response to Cott’s comment about Nex Benedict, the LGBTQ+ student who died, Hardin said, “That’s horrible. I don’t know about that case but I’ll check into it.” Stephens said that as an educator, he had taken an oath to educate and not “indoctrinate” students. “We are there to educate our students, love and nurture them and help them to be successful,” Stephens said. Michael Stopp, who chairs the Chamber of Commerce Government Affairs Committee, moderated the forum. Stopp said the death of any student is tragic and what happened to Nex Benedict is “terrible.” “I do want to caution everyone on what they read in social media,and even sometimes in the [traditional] media. What we found out this morning ... what we were hearing about the incident in Owasso, was not completely accurate and was, in many ways, blown out of proportion,” Stopp said. Stopp said he’s seen no news about how the student actually died, and that there has been finger-pointing at the school district. “The school system sent out a press release stating they followed all procedures, including having a nurse speak to the children that were in the fight, and gave the parents the opportunity to call the police and press charges,” Stopp said. Pemberton did not respond to Cott’s question during the forum, but afterward, he said he didn’t believe there was any animosity in the Legislature toward the LGBTQ+ community. “Legislators represent their constituents and their desires. More often, it’s the majority of the constituents they represent. Legislators can never satisfy all people all the time,” Pemberton said. “I can’t confirm the number [of bills Cott] presented in the meeting today.” When asked what he thought of Woods’ characterization of LGBTQ+ individuals as “filth,” Pemberton said, “No comment.” After the forum, Woods reiterated his stance on the matter. “I support my constituency, and like I said, we’re a Christian state, and we are tired of having that shoved down our throat at every turn. I’ll let my words [spoken here] speak for theirselves, but that is my statement, and I stand behind it, and I stand behind the Republican Party values, and that is my statement,” Woods said. What’s next The next Legislative Update is March 29 at Go Ye Village at 7:30 a.m. The next State of the Community event is Thursday, Feb. 29, 11 a.m. at Go Ye Village. The next monthly mingle is at Friday, March 1 at 8 at Kroner and Baer. The Women in Business event is March 13 at Legacy at MK Ranch. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular images.

Chance of rain 50%. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:37 am Oklahoma prisoner advocate Emily Shelton awoke to her phone buzzing about 7 a.m. on Oct. 26. Using state-issued tablets, prisoners told Shelton that a man on their unit had been beaten to death overnight with no staff intervention. Word spread on social media that morning and concerned family members began calling the facility urging them to investigate. At approximately 10:20 a.m., several hours after inmates started messaging Shelton, prison personnel found Raymond Bailey dead at the bottom of a trash can, covered with empty milk cartons. A state medical examiner’s report indicates that a group of prisoners hogtied and gagged Bailey and proceeded to stab and beat him to death. The medical examiner, who found no evidence of intervention to save Bailey’s life, ruled the death a homicide. Bailey, who was 44, was serving a 40-year sentence for second-degree murder out of Oklahoma County. He would have been eligible for parole in 2039. Shelton, who runs the prisoner advocacy group Hooked on Justice, said a routine overnight cell check would have revealed that Bailey was missing from his cell and prompted an investigation. Improved oversight and surveillance could have prompted officials to respond and intervene in the assault, she said. “During the nighttime, when the warden isn’t there, things aren’t being done properly,” Shelton said. “There’s no excuse why they did not find that body until 10:30 in the morning.” The Department of Corrections requires facilities to conduct a minimum of five inmate counts throughout the day, including at least one overnight count, spokesperson Kay Thompson said. She said prisoners are required to raise their hand or otherwise indicate that they’re conscious during the count. A spokesman for the GEO Group, the Florida-based private corrections company that the state pays to operate the facility, referred questions about the incident to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. Thompson confirmed three prison staff members were terminated as part of an ongoing internal investigation into the murder, but said the agency cannot release more information about the firings until the investigation is complete. She said the Comanche County District Attorney’s Office has taken over a criminal investigation into Bailey’s death from the Department of Corrections with formal charges expected by March. Bobby Cleveland, a former state lawmaker and executive director of Oklahoma Corrections Professional, a group that advocates for state prison employees, said persistent understaffing raises the likelihood of violence behind bars. He said employees are sometimes expected to monitor more than 200 prisoners at a time. Department of Corrections budget documents show the agency employed 1,301 state correctional officers as of Dec. 31, down from 1,501 in March 2021. Lawton prison staff are not included in this count, which reflects broader correctional staffing trends in the state. “When you don’t have enough people, bad things are going to happen,” Cleveland said. “These inmates are dying because they can’t get around quick enough to save them.” Violent incidents and allegations of staff misconduct have plagued the Lawton prison, which houses more than 2,500 medium and maximum security prisoners. In early December, three staff members were hospitalized after a prisoner stabbed them with a homemade weapon. The injuries were non-life threatening, KSWO-TV reported at the time. In a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the GEO Group in November, Linda Gray claims staff willfully neglected her son Justin Barrientos’ medical emergency and caused his death in January 2023. While a Department of Corrections investigator recommended manslaughter charges, the Comanche County District Attorney’s office has yet to file formal charges in the case. Oklahoma’s contract with the GEO Group to house state prisoners at the Lawton prison runs through July 31. The agreement gives the state the authority to purchase the facility and take over operations with at least 180 days’ notice. Declines in Oklahoma’s prison population over the past five years have prompted state officials to vacate or take over multiple private prisons. The Department of Corrections took control of the 1,600-bed Allen Gamble Correctional Center, previously known as the Davis Correctional Facility, from CoreCivic on Oct. 1. Similar to Lawton, complaints of excessive violence and mismanagement plagued the prison when it was privately controlled. Announcing the transition last August, Department of Corrections Director Stephen Harpe said the state could more efficiently and effectively care for the men under state control. Shelton said she’s pleased the state is investigating the death and fired involved staff but fears similar incidents will continue as long as prisons remain understaffed. “If something like this was able to happen, how much more is going on that they don’t even know about?” said Shelton, whose husband and son are incarcerated in Oklahoma prisons. “Or they just turn their head and don’t care. It’s one or the other.” Editor’s Note: This story was updated to clarify that Lawton Correctional Facility staff are GEO employees. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular images.

For Tulsa event at the River Spirit Resort. It was an inspiration for many. Forced to swim against a male swimmer in the 2022 NCAA Championships, Gaines tied the larger male at the contest, but the male, identifying as Lia Thomas, took home the trophy even though Gaines was ranked higher nationally. Thomas, the first openly transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I national championship is now suing World Aquatics in the international Court of Arbitration for Sport for its refusal to let Thomas compete in the women’s category. Gaines, with the full support of her school, turned injustice to advocacy and set an example of what personal courage means. The twenty-three-year-old athlete fights publicly for Title 9, the landmark federal civil rights law enacted as part of the Education Amendments of 1972 to prohibit sex-based discrimination in any school. Gaines also worked with the advocacy organization Independent Women’s Voice to encourage Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt to issue an executive order regarding the Women’s Bill of Rights. Stitt’s stated intention was to fortify into law sex-based words like ‘female,’ ‘woman,’ and ‘mother’ and protecting women-only spaces. Gaines said, “Oklahoma, I am such a fan of you guys. I am such a fan of Oklahoma Softball.” She mentioned people in the audience she knew and appreciated, then detailed the difference with her welcome that night and her reception when testifying to the U.S. Congress. “It is unfathomable to me as a 23-year-old recent college graduate, college swimmer at that, to go to [Washington] D.C. to sit in front of Congress and explain to them that men and women are different,” Gaines said. “And on the other side of that table, were these Libs with super confused looks on their faces.

I felt heartbroken. This is a sitting member of Congress and she resorts to name calling. Not even trying to prove her point or dissuade me from my stance or facts or logic or common sense or reasoning or science. Instead, she resorts to name calling a 23-year-old. “I get through my testimony. At the end I say, ‘Ranking Member Lee, if my testimony makes me transphobic, then by your own logic, your monologue makes you a misogynist.’” As a point of simple obvious fact, there are only two genders, male and female. Specifically in the Lia Thomas scam, Sarah Parshall Perry, Senior Legal Fellow, Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the Heritage Foundation wrote, “Lia Thomas has a distinct athletic benefit over even the most highly trained female aquatic competitors in the world.

She did note that “getting punched in the face by men wearing dresses doesn’t hurt that bad.” That incident ended hours later after university officials placated the criminals.

The House Government Modernization and Technology Committee passed House Bill 3914 that would prevent companies such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and X — formerly known as Twitter — from allowing minors under age 16 to have an account. Children ages 16 or 17 could create an account only if they had consent from a parent or legal guardian. Companies that violate the law could be fined $2,500 for each violation. Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, the bill’s author, said similar legislation has passed in Ohio, Utah, Arkansas and Louisiana while Congress has looked at addressing the issue on the federal level. Citing First Amendment issues, federal judges in Arkansas and Ohio have blocked the laws. Social media is hurting children’s mental health, Caldwell said, citing statistics about increased anxiety, depression and rates of self-harm among teenage girls. “There’s no question that social media has led to some pretty damaging effects to our kids,” said Caldwell, a father of three. He also expressed concerns about pedophiles contacting children through social media. The legislation would apply to companies that earn more than $100 million in annual gross revenue. Startups and smaller social media companies may not have the tools to verify an account holder’s age, Caldwell said. Rep. Melissa Provenzano, D-Tulsa, expressed concerns about social media companies asking children to upload a copy of a driver’s license or other government-issued ID to verify their age. Caldwell said the bill will evolve as it moves through the legislative process. He said the bill wouldn’t apply to TikTok or online gaming platforms, but he’s open to changing that so long as the measure doesn’t become overly broad or too restrictive. More: Should cellphones be allowed in schools? New Oklahoma bill would encourage districts to enact bans Caldwell said his bill is no different than when lawmakers set age limits for purchasing alcohol and tobacco products. “Every person parents their kids differently, and I’m not trying to come in between that,” he said. Many large social media companies already impose some age restrictions. Facebook, X, Instagram and Snapchat all require their account holders to be 13 years of age or older. The bill passed 11-0 with bipartisan support. It now advances to the full House.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:27 am Edmond, Oklahoma In July, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley could become the first woman to receive the Republican nomination for president, drawing votes from women and Democrats. That achievement could begin in Iowa, where 44% of registered Republicans are women. Ahead of Monday’s caucus, a new poll of Iowa Republican voters placed Haley over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for the first time. That poll shows about 20% of likely caucus goers favor Haley, compared to DeSantis’ 13%. The poll was released after the final debate between Haley and DeSantis, where the two exchanged verbal blows over their own political pasts, immigration, abortion, and front-runner former President Donald Trump. After the debate in Iowa, Haley pointed to her motherhood while speaking at a rally in Ankeny, with her two children sitting in the front row. She talked about parental rights in education: “For all you girl dads out there, and all you strong moms, we need to raise strong girls because strong girls become strong women, and strong women become strong leaders,” Haley said. “None of that happens if you have biological boys in girls sports.” On the campaign trail, some of Haley’s volunteers are seeing her femininity unsettle voters. Sylvia Jefferies said she has noticed in her work with Team Haley in South Carolina that some Republicans don’t take Haley’s candidacy seriously because she’s a woman. Jefferies flew from South Carolina to watch the final Republican debate before the Iowa primaries in a Des Moines sports bar. She supported Haley while she was serving as governor from 2011 to 2017. Jefferies said she’s drawn to Haley because of her demeanor. Jefferies, whose main issue is immigration, called Haley strong and intelligent and was pleased with Haley’s time serving in the U.N. “We need a good southern mama in the White House,” Jefferies said. “She is a human being coming and trying to rescue this country from the same old, same old.” In her home state, Jefferies goes door-knocking for the campaign and tries to connect with voters on Haley’s womanhood. “You start talking to them about their grandmothers and their mothers,” Jefferies said. “They say, ‘Oh, no my grandmother wouldn’t tolerate that.’ Don’t you see that similarity in Nikki?” In her experience, Jefferies said some male voters struggle to see the “strength” they identify with the presidency in a woman, as opposed to just seeing a candidate for office. However, Jefferies believes Haley’s most recent debate performance will help her image. Jefferies said her words in the debate were more definitive and “in your face.” Rural Iowan Calder Parott is a former Democrat who now supports Haley and is a registered Republican. Both Parott and a friend made the party switch about three months ago, having previously worked on Pete Buttigieg’s campaign for president during the 2020 election cycle. “We felt that we had to switch parties to back Nikki Haley,” Parrott said. “I thought (Haley) is the best candidate moving forward to get this country back on the right track.” Parrot said he expects a lot of moderate voters, specifically women, will end up backing Haley. He credited her views on abortion as being the most promising thing to pull moderates, adding her campaign should emphasize it. In an April visit to Iowa for a “Women for Nikki” event, Haley said she was “pro-life” but added she doesn’t judge those with an opposing viewpoint any more than she does with people who agree. According to a Des Moines Register story, Haley said abortion was a personal issue for women and men and should be treated with respect. “Her abortion standpoint to me ... it’s the best compromise between the two parties,” Parrot said. “If people are really paying attention to Nikki Haley, and even just the campaigns in general, her stances on abortion, I think are the most reasonable if you’re the president of the United States.” Parrot doesn’t think Haley’s campaign is directly targeting women voters but instead is more focused on trying to get some of Trump’s base. That being said, Parrot doesn’t think Haley is avoiding female voters either. While he has seen it heavily, Parrot said some gender bias likely exists within the Republican party toward Haley’s campaign. “For some reason, people don’t like to see powerful women in politics. I don’t get it,” Parrot said. “It’s not who’s saying it, it’s what they’re saying. In my mind, she may not be the perfect candidate, but she’s the best one we have right now.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:31 am Jason Chennault Cherokee County Sheriff Jason Chennault is announcing his candidacy for reelection in the 2024 election for the office of Cherokee County sheriff. Chennault, 49, has been an employee of the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office for over 25 years. He began his career at CCSO in January 1999 as a reserve deputy for former Sheriff Delena Goss and Undersheriff Dan Garber. Chennault’s first paid position with the sheriff’s office began in February 1999 as a part-time night dispatcher and jailer and part-time “trash cop.” The trash cop program involves a state-funded grant for Oklahoma’s rural law enforcement agencies to investigate illegal dumping. Chennault was promoted to full-time patrol deputy in summer 1999 and promoted again to investigator in September 2003. In January 2005, then-Police Chief Norman Fisher took office as Cherokee County sheriff and named Chennault as his chief investigator and public information officer. On Nov. 1, 2006, Fisher named Chennault, then 31, as undersheriff. Chennault’s promotion made him one of the youngest undersheriffs in the state. He was Fisher’s undersheriff for 13 years, making him the longest-serving undersheriff in the history of the CCSO. Chennault was appointed sheriff by the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners on Oct. 10, 2019, and took office on Nov. 1, 2019, upon Fisher’s retirement on Oct. 31, 2019. Chennault was elected sheriff in the 2020 election and began his first elected term in office in January 2021. Chennault is the second longest-serving employee in the history of the CCSO. He has twice been named the Cherokee County Law Enforcement Officer of the Year and was voted Cherokee County’s first-place favorite public figure in 2022 and third-place favorite public figure in 2023 by readers of the Tahlequah Daily Press. Chennault is a 1994 graduate of Markoma Bible Academy; a 2000 graduate of the Oklahoma State Council on Education and Training’s Full Time Peace Officer Academy; and holds a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from Northeastern State University. He is a 2003 graduate of CLEET’s Criminal Investigation Academy; a 2005 graduate of San Jose State University’s Homicide Investigations Academy; a 2007 graduate of the Oklahoma Sheriffs’ Academy; and a 2013 graduate of the FBI’s Crisis Negotiation Academy. He was an instructor in the November 2023 Oklahoma Sheriffs Association Sheriffs’ Academy. Chennault and his wife, Sherry, live in the Briggs area with their 14-year-old son, Taylon. An older son, Jaydin, lives in Tahlequah. Chennault is the son of Bill and Pat Snyder, of the Briggs area, and Terry Chennault of Tahlequah. He is the brother of Robbie Snyder of Tahlequah, and Nick Snyder, Melissa Snyder and Jaryn Linney, all of the Briggs area. Chennault is a registered Republican. In a little over four years in office, Chennault and his administrative staff have increased the number of deputies on patrol; purchased over 25 new patrol vehicles; purchased three K9 deputies with the assistance of grants; worked with Cherokee County’s rural elementary schools to add two additional school resource deputies; and increased the starting salaries of patrol deputies by over $13,000 a year. His deputies and investigators have taken pounds of illegal narcotics off the street and recovered hundreds of thousands of dollars of stolen property. “I believe I am your sheriff and feel my experience in the administration of the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office for over 17 years, my work ethic and my heart for service to the people of Cherokee County make me your best choice in the 2024 election for Cherokee County sheriff,” Chennault said. “I humbly ask for your vote.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

(Photo by Kathryn McNutt) By : Kathryn McNutt//The Journal Record//February 14, 2024// EDMOND – Business has been booming at Edmond’s public golf course since it reopened at the end of June after a $22 million renovation. “Since we’ve opened, we’ve done $2.76 million of revenue for the first six months. To give you an idea, the best prior year to us shutting down was $1.25 million (for the same six months),” Brian Soerensen, director of golf, said this week. That revenue generated $151,000 in sales tax, Soerensen said in a presentation to the Edmond City Council. The council approved the final change order to close out the project, which included a new $14.6 million clubhouse and $5.16 million in improvements to the greens and irrigation system. Both golfing and non-golfing activity has been strong at KickingBird Golf Club – both on the course and in the new 3,384-square-foot clubhouse and 6,670-square-foot events center – since the reopening, Soerensen said. Golfers had to play elsewhere for two years when the golf course was closed and the 50-year-old clubhouse was demolished and replaced. Soerensen said 29,363 paid rounds were played in the first six months, an increase of 6,625 rounds during the same period in 2020. Profits totaled $680,00 compared to $216,000 then, he said. “Our greens have taken a beating. You may have heard that from some of the golfers that have played out there,” Soerensen said. “We really look to budget at KickingBird for 42,000 paid rounds of golf and will most likely hit 60,000 rounds this year.” The grand opening created a lot of excitement, he said. “Everybody’s excited to see it. One of our challenges moving forward is how do we keep that excitement yet keep the number of rounds at around 42,000.” The first step being taken to limit the number of players is adjusting tee times, which used to be at 7 or 8 minute intervals. “We’ve now moved to 9 and we’re going to move to 10 in season,” Soerensen said. The other way to do it is increasing fees, which is not happening now. “We do need to look at maximizing revenues based on the 42,000 of paid rounds,” Soerensen said. “We would be looking at any fees increase for the spring of 2025.” The golf club renovation was done with economic development in mind. The goal is to bring in more multiday events that require more overnight stays, Soerensen said. KickingBird hosted a couple of new events already this year. The South Central Section PGA Walter Hopper Junior Championship – which drew 129 junior golfers from Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kansas – had an economic impact of $237,636, according to the Edmond Economic Development Authority. The NCAA Division II Men’s Regional Preview had 21 teams from the Central and Midwest Regions and had an economic impact of $201,387. Soerensen said the special events center has hosted birthday parties, rehearsal dinners, business meetings and celebrations. Davis Ellen Advertising Agency brought in 70 McDonald’s owners from across the country for a two-day business meeting, and the Fairview football team used the venue for a celebratory dinner after winning their division’s state championship. KickingBird also hosted several community non-golf events and 24 golf tournaments that generated more than $235,000 for organizations and charitable causes. “So a lot of neat and exciting things going on at the golf course,” he said. “Since we’ve opened, we’ve done $2.76 million of revenue for the first six months.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 4:29 pm A map provided by the United States Geological Survey shows the epicenter of Friday night’s 5.1 magnitude earthquake. An earthquake in central Oklahoma rattled much of the state Friday night. The shaking began just before 11:25 p.m. Initial seismic reports from the USGS showed a magnitude of 5.1 just north of Prague, which is not far from where a 5.7 magnitude earthquake shook the state in 2011. Lincoln County’s Deputy Emergency Management Director Charlotte Brown told the Associated Press no injuries were reported and damage was limited . “Nothing significant ... nothing other than lots of scared people,” Brown told the AP. While smaller earthquakes continue nearly weekly across the state, not many of Oklahoma’s earthquakes have registered over 5.0 in recent years. People on social media reported feeling it east of Tulsa and as far south as McAlester. Some reported that family told them it was felt in Kansas and Arkansas. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission posted early Saturday to social media that its Induced Seismicity Department is investigating the area. It was later determined that disposal wells in the area would be directed to a “change in operations.” “As its initial response to mitigate the risk of further seismic activity near the Prague area of Lincoln County, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s Oil and Gas Conservation Division has issued a directive for a change in the operations of some oil and gas wastewater disposal wells,” OCC posted Saturday afternoon. “All disposal wells that are permitted to dispose into the Arbuckle formation and are in an area within 10 miles of the Feb. 3, 2024, 5.1 magnitude earthquake are directed to begin the shutdown of operations, with a shutdown to be complete by Feb. 17. “The gradual shutdown process is necessary to avoid sudden pressure changes that could result in more seismic activity.” The 2011 Prague earthquake led to buckles in highway pavement, damaged homes and even led to some injuries. It sparked much of the study and policy that now surrounds earthquakes in Oklahoma. Before 2011, earthquakes over 4.0 were extremely rare. Two more large quakes that severely damaged homes and buildings were epicenter in Pawnee (5.8) and Cushing (5.0) in 2016. Those earthquakes sparked major lawsuits against oil and gas companies. Large earthquakes have mostly dwindled since 2016 as OCC began forcing oil and gas companies to reduce disposal well activity in those areas. “The Arbuckle formation is the state’s deepest formation. Oil and gas wastewater disposal into the Arbuckle formation has been linked to seismic activity in parts of the state,” OCC posted Saturday. “It should be stressed that that this action is an initial response. Further study may result in new directives.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles. Sign up now to get our FREE breaking news coverage delivered right to your inbox.

Editor\'s note: this article was updated at 6:54 p.m. Feb. 20 to reflect that it was Rep. Noah Coats was the one who called debate on ""The Trash Responsibility Act."" The Undergraduate Student Congress voted at its Tuesday meeting to approve the allocation of funds, pass an act promoting trash responsibility, and pass a resolution in support of diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Matters Act would establish SGA’s support of DEI efforts and programs. The resolution urges OU President Joseph Harroz Jr. and the Board of Regents to support DEI programs at OU. This resolution is in response to Gov. Kevin Stitt’s recent executive order, which removes state funding from university DEI offices and programs. Rep. Shrey Kathuria spoke on the resolution, saying DEI is “not trying to enforce any political ideology on anybody.” When asked what the resolution changes about current policy, Kathuria said, “Obviously state law does supersede SGA law. However, we as a student body want to fight our tails off to protect DEI because I want to protect students like you.” Rep. Michael Reynolds, among others, asked if other universities or entities had been consulted on the bill. Authors Shrey Kathuria and Caleb Robinson said they had not, but they are open to sending those universities or entities a copy of the resolution. A few mentioned include the Oklahoma State University Student Government, Langston University and historically black colleges and universities. Voting on the resolution began, but Rep. Vignech Anand called for a suspension of time. A suspension of time would allow Congress to rewind time and enter debate on the resolution. There was a roll call vote to suspend time, which failed. There will be no debate on this bill. The resolution passes with a vote of 23-1-0. Rep. Syed Aslam was the single vote against the bill. Reynolds motioned to reconsider the resolution, which requires a majority vote. There was a roll call vote to reconsider, which passed with a vote of 18-4-0. The resolution will be reconsidered. Friendly amendments were added to send the resolution to OU’s Diversity and Inclusion program, to multicultural fraternities and sororities and to OU Fraternity and Sorority Programs and Services. While discussing the goal of this resolution, Robinson said, “It’s more of a message to the legislators and to the executives in the Capitol that we stand for diversity and inclusion.” Kathuria, while discussing equity, said, “All we’re asking for is for everyone to have an equitable playing field.” The resolution passes with a vote of 19-1-0. Rep. Syed Aslam was the single vote against the bill. A few representatives left the meeting and were not present to vote. Allocation of Student Government Funds The Auxiliary Allocation 12 Act of 2023-24 allocates Student Government Association funds to registered student organizations. It proposes dispersing $81,115.82 among 125 organizations. Of those organizations, the International Advisory Committee is to receive the highest allotment of funds, $7,000. The organizations receiving the next highest allotments are the Black Student Association ($5,966) and the American Indian Student Organization ($5,560). The act makes provisions for unused funds and outlines details of the fiscal year. The act passes with a roll call vote of 19-0-1. Rep. Noah Coats abstained. Trash Responsibility Act The Trash Responsibility Act:Promoting Clean and Responsible Behavior on Campus encourages recycling, proposes consequences for littering and advises against using confetti on campus property. SGA hopes that the university will work with the sustainability committee to achieve these goals. Rep. Aaron Gilson-Bond spoke on the resolution, saying it seeks to create “a culture of cleanness, responsibility and environmental sustainability within the university community.” This resolution cites evidence from a recent survey the sustainability committee conducted. Gilson-Bond said the survey received about 102 responses. Rep. Madeline Cantrell proposed changing the language of the resolution to clarify only a small sample of the student body was surveyed. After deliberation, the authors accepted the amendment. Robinson motioned to extend time for questions, which requires a suspension of the rules. A roll call vote to suspend the rules failed. There will be no more time for questions. Rep. Noah Coats called for debate, and Robinson objected. There will be a roll call vote to determine if a debate will take place, which needs a two-thirds majority. The vote passes, and there will be no debate. The resolution passes with a vote of 16-4-0. Representatives Brianna Cisneros, Kyle Martin, Noah Coats and Michael Reynolds voted against the resolution. If you\'ve read this far, you are as invested in this city and campus as we are. That\'s why we are asking you to invest in us. Since 1916, the Daily has served the Norman and OU communities with free independent journalism, with all decisions made locally with no administrative, governmental or corporate influence. We provide Norman with the city\'s largest reporting staff, drawn from one of the nation\'s top journalism colleges. Our coverage is routinely honored at state and national levels. And we\'re advised by a veteran professional staff with a mission to help us build on our legacy as a launching pad for media professionals. OU students pay about $14 in annual fees that help support the Daily. If you find value in our work and are not a student, please consider matching or exceeding that with a one-time or recurring donation. In an era when subscriptions to paywalled news organizations routinely exceed $100 annually, grassroots support from readers like you can collectively make a transformative difference in our organization.'}]"

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:31 am Genealogist Rikisha Harrison shared a startling statistic at the Legacy Keepers R. Us bruncheon Saturday. “Can you believe each one of us has 1,024 eighth-great-grandmothers?” Harrison said. “What an honor.” And each eighth-great-grandmother, and each descendant since them, has a story to tell, she said. The bruncheon honored area residents as Legacy Keepers, Legends and Pacesetters. “We are more than just individuals,” said Harrison, one of the speakers. “We are the sums of the generations that came before. Knowing where we come from empowers us to know who we are.” Harrison put together a genealogy planner workbook and sold it at the bruncheon. “It is more than a hobby to me,” she said. “It’s a way of honoring and connecting with the people who came before me, the ones who sacrificed for me, the ones who shaped me who I am today.” She said she also learned about herself. “Through a genetic DNA test, I found that I’m African, Swedish, German, Cherokee and British,” Harrison said, adding that she discovered that one of her eighth-great-grandmothers is Early American Cherokee leader Nancy Ward. “I’m telling you about my heritage and I’m proud of it all,” she said. “I’m on a journey to discover who I am.” Photographer Kelvin Brown, who is known for shooting photographs at Muskogee events, stressed the value of documenting more immediate stories. “We are closer to history than we think,” Brown said. “You are connected to your family in different ways. You know your grandmother in one way, her children know her differently, her contemporaries know something else. If you have the opportunity, get all those perspectives to try to make the whole person.” He said he keeps copies of his digital photos in a safe deposit box. “And it is marked for the Oklahoma Genealogical Society,” Brown said. “I want to make sure those pictures survive before me.” Father and son funeral directors Edward L. David Winn and E. David Winn II found honors memories to share from the ceremony. The elder Winn was honored as a Legacy Keeper Legend. He said he sought to pass a legacy to his son. “I wanted to teach him to be sympathetic and be willing to serve families in their period of bereavement,” the elder Winn said. The younger Winn said it was a blessing to be honored at the same event as his father. “I worked hard, and he worked hard to provide his legacy for me, so I plan on keeping it,” the younger Winn said, defining that legacy as “service before anything.” Legends • Bill John Baker, former Principal Chief of Cherokee Nation. • Mildred Hemphill-Burkhalter, Rentiesville mayor. • Edward L.

Insects at risk of extinction find safety in gardens filled with native plants blooming under the care of community scientists and conservation activists. Neosho Parthenia Brown was given 160 acres of land by the United States government in 1899 as recompense for the forced removal the Muscogee and Euchee tribes faced under the Indian Removal Act and Dawes Act. Over 100 years later, her great-granddaughter Jane Breckinridge transformed part of that land into the Euchee Butterfly Farm. The farm focuses on the preservation of the migrating monarch butterfly, featuring swaths of indigenous plants grown to preserve the biodiversity of Oklahoma by providing food and homes to native insects, Breckinridge said. The monarch butterfly usually makes an annual appearance in Oklahoma in late September and early October on its way to Mexico for the cold months. However, due to a loss of habitat and safe food sources on its migration path, the butterfly is currently listed as vulnerable by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Breckinridge started the farm in 2013 at the tail-end of her career in publishing. She lived in St. Paul, Minnesota with her husband, a butterfly farmer. When she turned 40, Breckinridge said she felt homesick for Oklahoma and wanted to return to her family’s land. While working remotely for her publishing company, Breckinridge and her husband began work on establishing the Euchee Butterfly Farm. Breckinridge focused her efforts on establishing a haven for the migrating monarchs out of fear for their decline, but she also wanted to ensure it would benefit many other native Oklahoman pollinators. “The monarchs are just the canary in the coal mine for what’s happening for all of our pollinators,” Breckinridge said. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there is a steady decline in pollinator populations across the nation predominantly caused by the use of harsh pesticides and loss of habitat. Pollinators contribute to 35% of the world’s food crops, making their decline not just dangerous for the insects, but for humans. Honey bees in particular are vital to food production, pollinating $15 billion dollars worth of crops in the U.S. annually. However, it is not just bee and butterfly populations at risk. James Hung, assistant professor of biology, said it is likely that despite the fact bees are the “poster child” for insect conservation efforts, only around half of the species of bees present in Oklahoma are known. He added that many other species of insects are likely still waiting to be discovered. “If you don’t know what you have, then you don’t know what needs to be protected,” Hung said. Brenda Smith, conservation biologist and heritage zoologist, said conservation groups overall struggle to focus on insects over other kinds of animals because of a bias towards “cute” creatures such as birds and mammals. However, conservation organizations like the Euchee Butterfly Farm are making moves toward balancing out the efforts. It’s not just pollinators like bees and butterflies that are in trouble according to Hung. Hung said species of decomposers, predators and soil agitators are also at risk of going extinct. However, it’s uncommon for people to think about those branches of the ecosystem because they are behind the scenes. While each kind of insect plays a vital role in the ecosystem, Smith said they are also important because they are present. “I want people to understand the intrinsic value of (biodiversity) existing. Biodiversity has just as much right to exist as we do,” Smith said. Despite the need for more information on the native insects of Oklahoma, there is a lack of personnel and public interest to fuel insect research in the state, Smith said. She explained that Oklahoma is often perceived as boring despite the hundreds of animal species that call the state home. In Smith’s role as a heritage zoologist, she is often asked for information regarding the prevalence of insect species native to Oklahoma. Due to a lack of data, she often has few answers. “It’s kind of unsettling,” Smith said. Every 10 years, the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation releases a report including a list of species needing conservation efforts. In 2005, the report listed 248 species. 10 years later, the number reached 312. Smith said the next report will likely have a longer list. She also said because of the lack of personnel able to research and monitor Oklahoma’s species, the lists are probably only a fraction of the true number of animals that need help. Some of them may never get help, Hung said. “Every species has earned the right to be here through millennia of not going extinct,” Hung said. Hung said biodiversity is vital for resilience. As the planet changes, each insect species will handle it differently. Even if several species play a similar role, one may thrive in a particular annual climate over the others. Redundancies in the insect population prevent failure. “It’s like we are disassembling the airplane as we fly. You remove one screw, the plane will probably keep going. How many screws can you remove and still expect the plane to land intact after hitting several storms? We don’t know,” Hung said. “As passengers on that plane, we have a vested interest in keeping every bolt in place.” People outside of the scientific field are making efforts to save the state’s insect population.

You can read the updated report here. WASHINGTON − Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are mentioned in newly unsealed Jeffrey Epstein-related court documents, but they are not accused of any wrongdoing involving the disgraced sex trafficking financier. Clinton, who sometimes flew aboard Epstein\'s private plane, is listed repeatedly in the documents. He was the topic of an argument over the credibility of a witness who said she saw the former president when he was a guest of Epstein\'s. Trump\'s name appears in a document in which Epstein is quoted as saying he would invite the then-real estate mogul to join him at a casino. In another document, a witness said she was never asked to engage in sexual relations with Trump. The unsealed documents also list prominent people who have denied accusations against them, including Prince Andrew of Great Britain and prominent litigator Alan Dershowitz. ""The Epstein list and guilt by association,"" Dershowitz said on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter. On Fox News, Dershowitz said that “the woman who accused me has now stated categorically that she may have misidentified me continuously with someone else. … I never met her, never heard of her, never spoke to her.” More: Woman who accused Prince Andrew drops \'mistaken\' allegations against Alan Dershowitz Among others named: billionaire hedge fund founder Glenn Dubin, high-powered fashion CEO Les Wexner, and deceased modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel. All of the accused have denied allegations of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. Most of the documents unsealed late Wednesday were part of a lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein\'s victims. More documents − and names − were expected to be released on Thursday. One of Giuffre\'s attorneys, Sigrid McCawley, said that more needs to be known about ""who enabled and facilitated"" Epstein\'s trafficking network and that survivors of his abuse deserve more justice. ""The public interest must still be served in learning more about the scale and scope of Epstein\'s racket to further the important goal of shutting down sex trafficking wherever it exists and holding more to account,"" McCawley said. ""The unsealing of these documents gets us closer to that goal."" Other names released Wednesday include sex abuse victims, litigation witnesses, and Epstein associates and employees. Many had only a tangential connection to the financier, who was accused of operating an international sex trafficking ring targeting underage girls. Some of the people named are now deceased. Related: Epstein list brings a frenzy of Clinton and Trump conspiracies More: What\'s true and false about Jeffrey Epstein and the individuals on his list David Ring, a California-based trial lawyer who has represented many sexual abuse victims, said public release of information can help victims gain closure. He noted that victims are often restricted by civil settlements from talking about the abuse they experienced. ""Anytime that there\'s a spotlight that\'s shown on the perpetrator and his circle of friends and what went on there, I think that\'s a good thing,"" Ring said. ""It gives the victims a lot of closure, frankly, instead of just secrecy where they\'re not even allowed to talk about it."" Earlier releases listed Clinton and Trump as passengers on Epstein\'s private plane, but neither has been accused of wrongdoing. For years, supporters of Trump and Clinton have accused each of the former presidents of greater involvement with Epstein. But nothing in the new documents backs up those claims. Trump posed with Epstein and partner Ghislaine Maxwell in a now-famous photo taken in 2000 at Mar-a-Lago, his private Palm Beach club. In 2002 he referred to Epstein as a ""terrific guy” in an interview with New York Magazine. “He’s a lot of fun to be with,"" Trump said.

U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska ordered the unsealing of more documents in mid-December, noting that most of the information was already public and that people named in the documents had not objected to their release. Hours before the release, Judge Preska wrote Wednesday that two people identified as ""Doe 107"" and ""Doe 110"" had asked that their names remain under seal pending future court action. The documents stem from a now-settled 2015 lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre, who accused Epstein and Maxwell of directing her involvement with prominent men. In pretrial litigation, Maxwell said that Giuffre lied about seeing Clinton on Epstein\'s private Caribbean island and that this assertion undercut her credibility in general. This dispute is the reason the former president\'s name pops up so frequently in the documents. Clinton\'s office said in 2019 that the former president had never been to Epstein\'s island and had ""not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade.” More: \'Friends\' actor Matthew Perry was not on Jeffrey Epstein\'s flight logs | Fact check Epstein was a wealthy financier known for mixing with celebrities, scientists, politicians and billionaires. He was first arrested in Palm Beach, Florida, in 2005 on charges he paid a 14-year-old girl for sex. Even though other girls described similar abuse, a now-controversial deal allowed Epstein to plead guilty in 2008 to a single charge, and he was allowed to spend days at his office while sleeping at the county jail during his 13-month sentence. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged Epstein with sex trafficking in 2019 after the Miami Herald renewed interest in the case. He died by suicide in jail awaiting trial. Since then, dozens of boldfaced names have seen their reputations suffer for associating with Epstein. “He’s going to haunt a lot of people,” said George Arzt, a veteran Democratic political consultant. The Miami Herald intervened for access to records from Giuffre\'s suit in 2018. This was the eighth round of releases involving the Epstein case. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls.

The House Government Modernization and Technology Committee passed House Bill 3914 that would prevent companies such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and X — formerly known as Twitter — from allowing minors under age 16 to have an account. Children ages 16 or 17 could create an account only if they had consent from a parent or legal guardian. Companies that violate the law could be fined $2,500 for each violation. Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, the bill’s author, said similar legislation has passed in Ohio, Utah, Arkansas and Louisiana while Congress has looked at addressing the issue on the federal level. Citing First Amendment issues, federal judges in Arkansas and Ohio have blocked the laws. Social media is hurting children’s mental health, Caldwell said, citing statistics about increased anxiety, depression and rates of self-harm among teenage girls. “There’s no question that social media has led to some pretty damaging effects to our kids,” said Caldwell, a father of three. He also expressed concerns about pedophiles contacting children through social media. The legislation would apply to companies that earn more than $100 million in annual gross revenue. Startups and smaller social media companies may not have the tools to verify an account holder’s age, Caldwell said. Rep. Melissa Provenzano, D-Tulsa, expressed concerns about social media companies asking children to upload a copy of a driver’s license or other government-issued ID to verify their age. Caldwell said the bill will evolve as it moves through the legislative process. He said the bill wouldn’t apply to TikTok or online gaming platforms, but he’s open to changing that so long as the measure doesn’t become overly broad or too restrictive. More: Should cellphones be allowed in schools? New Oklahoma bill would encourage districts to enact bans Caldwell said his bill is no different than when lawmakers set age limits for purchasing alcohol and tobacco products. “Every person parents their kids differently, and I’m not trying to come in between that,” he said. Many large social media companies already impose some age restrictions. Facebook, X, Instagram and Snapchat all require their account holders to be 13 years of age or older. The bill passed 11-0 with bipartisan support. It now advances to the full House.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Oklahoma announced that Jerry Lee Matlock Jr., 41, pleaded guilty to an information charging him with one count of second-degree murder in Indian Country and one count of use, carry, brandish and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. Court documents allege that on the evening of Sept. 14, 2021, Matlock intentionally shot an individual with a rifle outside a Stilwell residence before fleeing the scene of the crime. Adair County deputies responding to the shooting discovered the victim dead from a gunshot wound to the chest. The crimes occurred in Adair County, within the boundaries of the Cherokee Nation reservation, in the Eastern District of Oklahoma. The charges arose from an investigation launched by the Adair County Sheriff’s Office, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, and the FBI. U.S. Magistrate Judge Jason A. Robertson, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, accepted the plea and ordered completion of a presentence investigation report. Matlock was remanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshal Service, pending sentencing. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Gross prosecuted the case. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular images.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:38 am FILE — This combination of photos shows logos of X, formerly known as Twitter, top left; Snapchat, top right; Facebook, bottom left; and TikTok, bottom right. OKLAHOMA CITY – A state House panel on Tuesday unanimously advanced legislation that would restrict teenagers’ access to major social media platforms. The House Government Modernization and Technology Committee passed House Bill 3914 that would prevent companies such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and X – formerly known as Twitter – from allowing minors under age 16 to have an account. Children ages 16 or 17 could create an account only if they had consent from a parent or legal guardian. Companies that violate the law could be fined $2,500 for each violation. Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, the bill’s author, said similar legislation has passed in Ohio, Utah, Arkansas and Louisiana while Congress has looked at addressing the issue on the federal level. Citing First Amendment issues, federal judges in Arkansas and Ohio have blocked the laws. Social media is hurting children’s mental health, Caldwell said, citing statistics about increased anxiety, depression and rates of self-harm among teenage girls. “There’s no question that social media has led to some pretty damaging effects to our kids,” said Caldwell, a father of three. He also expressed concerns about pedophiles contacting children through social media. The legislation would apply to companies that earn more than $100 million in annual gross revenue. Startups and smaller social media companies may not have the tools to verify an account holder’s age, Caldwell said. Rep. Melissa Provenzano, D-Tulsa, expressed concerns about social media companies asking children to upload a copy of a driver’s license or other government-issued ID to verify their age. Caldwell said the bill will evolve as it moves through the legislative process. He said the bill wouldn’t apply to TikTok or online gaming platforms, but he’s open to changing that so long as the measure doesn’t become overly broad or too restrictive. Caldwell said his bill is no different than when lawmakers set age limits for purchasing alcohol and tobacco products. “Every person parents their kids differently, and I’m not trying to come in between that,” he said. Many large social media companies already impose some age restrictions. Facebook, X, Instagram and Snapchat all require their account holders to be 13 years of age or older. The bill passed 11-0 with bipartisan support. It now advances to the full House.
