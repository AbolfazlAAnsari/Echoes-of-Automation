lot of success. The qualifications to be called a dynasty vary, but the Kansas City Chiefs are poised to be included in the conversation. The Chiefs won their second straight Super Bowl championship and third in the last five years last Sunday with a 25-22, overtime victory – just the second overtime game in Super Bowl history – over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII (58). It had been decades in the making for the Chiefs, who prior to their current streak hadn’t hoisted the Lombardi Trophy since the 1969 season, when quarterback Len Dawson, wide receiver Otis Taylor, defensive end Buck Buchanan, and coach Hank Stram delivered a 23-7 win over the Minnesota Vikings in SB IV. That’s a lot of years and a lot of Roman numerals ago. Coach Andy Reid and quarterback Patrick Mahomes are the chief reasons behind Kansas City’s recent success. Reid has rebuilt his legacy. During his 14-year tenure in Philadelphia (1999-2012), “Big Red” had a habit of coming up short in big games. The Eagles reached five NFC Championship games in those years (2001-04, 2008), but lost four – including two at home to Tampa Bay and Carolina, respectively, as the conference’s number one seed. They finally made the Super Bowl in the 2004 season, only to lose to Tom Brady and the Patriots. By 2012, it was apparent that both the franchise and the coach needed a change. And it worked out for both sides, though it took a while. The Eagles had to suffer through three years of Chip Kelly before coach Doug Pederson and backup quarterback Nick Foles led them to the franchise’s first Super Bowl win – they had won NFL titles in 1947-48 and 1960 in the pre-Super Bowl era – in 2017. Meanwhile, Reid’s tenure in Kansas City got off to a rocky start. The Chiefs made the playoffs in 2013, but blew a 28-point lead en route to a 45-44 loss at Indianapolis in the Wild-Card round. His big-game failings continued for a few more seasons. He made the playoffs in four of his first five seasons with the Chiefs, but continued to come up short. If Chiefs fans wanted to watch a dynasty back then, they had to tune in reruns of the old TV show featuring Blake (John Forsythe) and Alexis (Joan Collins) Carrington. Kansas City’s fortunes changed soon after Mahomes’ arrival as the Chiefs’ first-round draft pick in 2017 out of Texas Tech. Starting in 2019, Mahomes and Reid guided the Chiefs to four Super Bowl appearances in a five-year span, a feat attained only by New England’s Brady and coach Bill Belichick in 2014-18 and Buffalo’s Jim Kelly and Marv Levy in 1990-93. This year’s appearance might have been the most impressive, considering the Chiefs beat the AFC’s top two seeds – Buffalo and Baltimore – to earn the trip to Las Vegas. Mahomes’ magic appeared to be running out in the first half against the 49ers – he threw for only 123 yards and tossed an interception while the Niners went ahead 10-0 – but delivered when it mattered most in the fourth quarter and overtime. And there’s little reason to think they won’t be back. The AFC is stacked with talented teams such as the Bills, Ravens, Houston Texans and others, but don’t be surprised if Taylor Swift is watching Travis Kelce from a luxury suite in New Orleans during Super Bowl LIX. It remains to be seen if brother Jason Kelce will be joining Taylor in the stands as a spectator again or perhaps even standing on the other sideline with the Eagles. Jason, who is said to be contemplating retirement after 13 seasons as the Eagles’ center, appeared to be embracing his role as a fan in recent weeks. He was the talk of social media when he became an honorary member of the “Bills Mafia” in Buffalo, chugging booze out of bowling ball in the parking lot, then later leaping barechested into the stands to join in more revelry.

Photos began circulating during the week that showed the Sea Isle City summer resident seemingly honoring the host city of Las Vegas by showing up dressed like Alan from “The Hangover,” complete with t-shirt and satchel. Is this the real Caesars Palace? And is it pager-friendly? However, the picture was photoshopped. But the other antics were real.

Platkin Friday announced a $350 million national settlement with Publicis Health, LLC (“Publicis”) to resolve investigations into the global marketing and communications firm’s role in the prescription opioid crisis. New Jersey will receive nearly $9.5 million from the settlement to help address the opioid crisis. Unlike certain other opioid settlements, the Publicis settlement does not contemplate participation by local governments. The settlement funds will therefore be spent solely by the State in support of its harm abatement efforts. The settlement resolves a complaint the State filed Thursday alleging that Publicis engaged in unconscionable commercial practices that are prohibited by the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. In agreeing to the terms of the settlement, Publicis recognized the harm its conduct caused. This settlement will give the communities hit hardest by the opioid crisis more financial support for treatment and recovery, which will help build lasting infrastructure and save lives. The filings in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Mercer County, describe how Publicis’s work contributed to the crisis by helping Purdue Pharma and other opioid manufacturers market and sell opioids. Court documents detail how Publicis acted as Purdue’s agency of record for all its branded opioid drugs, including OxyContin, even developing sales tactics that relied on farming data from recordings of personal health-related in-office conversations between patients and providers. Publicis also encouraged and facilitated Purdue’s partnership with another company, Practice Fusion, to market OxyContin to providers through alerts displayed directly on patient electronic health records at the exact time treatment decisions were being made. “When you visit a physician, you do not expect that the details of your most intimate and personal struggles with illness and pain will be converted into pharmaceutical product marketing materials to be used to increase opioid sales,” Platkin said. “I can’t think of a better example of an ‘unconscionable’ commercial practice than exploiting the suffering of patients in order to grow profits.” In addition to harvesting data from recordings of patient-provider conversations and engineering the strategy of using patients’ electronic health records to remind providers to prescribe Oxycontin, the complaint also alleges that Publicis created additional marketing strategies to increase opioid sales and fuel the crisis. Specifically, Publicis advised and assisted Purdue Pharma in using unbranded marketing that relied on front groups and key opinion leaders to disseminate messaging that prescription opioids were safe and less addictive. As the complaint explains, “under the guise of neutrality, these groups and opinion leaders conveyed this message to healthcare providers, patients, and policymakers without disclosing that they were being paid or financed by Purdue.” All told, the complaint illustrates how Publicis’s aggressive and harmful sales strategies contributed to the opioid crisis, both nationwide and in our state. According to the New Jersey Department of Health, more than 9,800 individuals have died from a prescription opioid overdose over the last 10 years. These deaths—and the impacts on thousands who have struggled with opioid addiction—have created considerable costs for our healthcare, child welfare, and criminal justice systems. Beyond the financial toll to the state, Publicis’s work has driven opioid addiction, substance use, and overdose deaths that have torn families apart, damaged relationships, and devastated communities. As part of the settlement, Publicis will release on a public website thousands of internal documents detailing its work for opioid companies like Purdue Pharma. Publicis must produce all documents no later than 12 months after execution of the Consent Judgments to be filed by all participating States. In addition, Publicis will stop accepting client work for opioid-based Schedule II and Schedule III controlled substances. The terms of the settlement also apply to Publicis’s related entities, including Razorfish Health, LLC; Verilogue, Inc.; Publicis Health Media, LLC, Rosetta Marketing Services, LLC; and Saatchi & Saatchi Healthcare Communications, Inc. Publicis Health and those related entities are part of the French multinational firm Publicis Groupe; the $350 million settlement, however, only applies to Publicis Health and the other US-based firms. The filings are the latest action Attorney General Platkin has taken to combat the opioid crisis and to hold accountable those responsible for creating and fueling the crisis. In New Jersey, the State and eligible local governments currently stand to receive approximately $1.14 billion in opioid settlement funds from other nationwide legal settlements with drug manufacturers, drug distributors, and pharmacy chains for their roles in the crisis. These funds are to be used for initiatives to save lives, promote addiction prevention and harm reduction, increase access to treatment and recovery services, and otherwise mitigate the harms that the opioid crisis has visited upon our communities. The State has also secured additional recoveries through settlements with McKinsey & Co. and a pharmaceutical executive who contributed to the opioid crisis, and remains committed to holding accountable other actors who profit from the addiction epidemic. Colorado led the multistate group during the Publicis investigation and was joined on an executive committee by the attorneys general of California, Connecticut, Idaho, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, and Vermont. Attorneys general from all states, territories, and the District of Columbia have signed onto and joined the Publicis settlement.

Circuit has ruled that Donald Trump does not enjoy broad immunity from federal prosecution, a major legal setback for the former president, who said he will appeal. They wrote that for the purposes of this criminal case, ""former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant."" The ruling comes a month after lawyers for Trump made sweeping claims that he enjoyed immunity from federal prosecution, claims that lawyers for the special counsel said would ""undermine democracy"" and give presidents license to commit crimes while in the White House, such as accepting bribes for directing government contracts or selling nuclear secrets to a foreign adversary. It would be ""a striking paradox,"" the judges wrote, if the president, who alone has the constitutional duty to ensure that laws be faithfully executed, ""were the sole officer capable of defying those laws with impunity."" Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump, said the former president ""respectfully disagrees with the DC Circuit\'s decision and will appeal it in order to safeguard the Presidency and the Constitution."" ""If immunity is not granted to a President, every future President who leaves office will be immediately indicted by the opposing party,"" he said in a statement. ""Without complete immunity, a President of the United States would not be able to properly function!"" The special counsel\'s team declined to comment. The court said Tuesday that its analysis was specific to the case in front of them. One of the D.C. Circuit judges, Florence Pan, pressed Trump attorney D. John Sauer at the oral argument about whether a president might sell pardons or nuclear secrets, or even order a Navy SEAL team to kill a political opponent, and still evade criminal prosecution under his theory of the case. Another, Judge Karen L. Henderson, noted that it seemed ""paradoxical"" that presidents would pledge to faithfully execute the laws, only to violate those same laws and receive legal protection. ""We cannot accept that the office of the Presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter,"" the judges wrote. Doing so, they said, ""would collapse our system of separated powers by placing the President beyond the reach of all three branches."" Trump has pleaded not guiltyto four felony counts that accuse him of leading a conspiracy to cling to power and disenfranchise millions of voters in 2020. Prosecutors say that this culminated in violence at the U.S. Capitol three years ago that injured 140 law enforcement officers and shook the foundations of American democracy. Tuesday\'s decision comes at a crucial time for both Trump and the federal case against him. Trump is the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination and continues to insist — without basis in fact — that he won the 2020 presidential election. Already, Trump\'s serious legal troubles — he is fighting 91 criminal charges in four separate U.S. jurisdictions — are clashing with the political calendar. The former president has signaled that he could seek to dismiss the federal cases against him in the District of Columbia and Florida if he regains the White House.
