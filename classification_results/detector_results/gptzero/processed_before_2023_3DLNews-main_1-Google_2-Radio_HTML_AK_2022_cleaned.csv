Wally Cleaver on the sitcom “Leave It to Beaver” helped create the popular and lasting image of the American teenager of the 1950s and 60s, died Wednesday. He was 77. Frank Bilotta, who represented Dow in his work as a sculptor, confirmed his death in an email to The Associated Press. No cause was given, but Dow had been in hospice care and announced in May that he had been diagnosed with prostate and gall bladder cancer. “Although this is a very sad day, I have comfort and peace that he is in a better place,” Dow’s son Christopher said in a post on his father’s official Facebook page. “He was the best Dad anyone could ask for. He was my coach, my mentor, my voice of reason, my best friend, my best man in my wedding, and my hero.” A post on Dow’s Facebook page on Tuesday prematurely reported that he had died, but his wife and management team later took down the post and explained that it was announced in error. Dow’s Wally was an often annoyed but essentially loving big brother who was constantly bailing out the title character, Theodore “Beaver” Cleaver, played by Jerry Mathers, on the show that was synonymous with the sometimes hokey, wholesome image of the 1950s American family. Dow was born and raised in the Hollywood section of Los Angeles — his mother was a stuntwoman who acted as a double for silent film star Clara Bow — but his parents did not push him into show business. He had done just a little stage acting and appeared in a pair of pilots. After attending an open casting call, he landed his career-defining role as Wally. Dow would play the part for six seasons and more than 200 episodes from 1957 to 1963 on primetime on CBS and ABC, then for more than 100 episodes in the 1980s on a syndicated sequel series. On the show, Wally, sometimes the center of the plot himself, navigated the worlds of junior high and high school — his two-faced best friend Eddie Haskell at his side — with just a little more wisdom than his little brother. The show’s plotlines suggested Wally was bound for great things — he mentions wanting to become an aerospace engineer — and he tended to find himself in moral dilemmas that stemmed from his essential goodness. Dow’s favorite episode was one in which the always-ready-to-teach father, Ward Cleaver, played by Hugh Beaumont, wants his boys to know what his childhood was like. He takes them into the wilderness, despite their having what they felt was pressing business at home. “The boys didn’t want to go because ‘Zombies From Outer Space’ was playing in the theater,” Dow said in a 2018 interview with Sidewalks Entertainment at Silicon Valley Comic-Con. After the trip, at the end of the episode, Ward discovers the boys on a hilltop with binoculars, thinking they’re taking in some nature. “They were watching Zombies from Outer Space at the drive-in,” Dow said with a laugh. The show was still popular when it went off the air, but it had naturally run its course with Wally about to go to college and Beaver bound for high school. Dow’s death leaves Mathers and Rusty Stevens, who played Beaver’s friend Larry Mondello, as the only surviving members of the show’s core cast. Beaumont died in 1982. Barbara Billingsley, who played mother June Cleaver, died in 2010. Ken Osmond, who played Haskell, died in 2020. Dow would appear as a guest star on other TV series throughout the 1960s, 70s and 80s, including “My Three Sons,” “Dr. Kildare,” “Adam-12,” “Emergency,” “Square Pegs” and “Knight Rider.” He took a break from acting to serve three years in the U.S. National Guard in the late 1960s. From 1983 to 1989, amid a cultural craze for nostalgia television, Dow reprised the role of Wally in “The New Leave it to Beaver.” He began writing and directing episodes of that series, and would work as a director in television throughout the 1990s on shows including “The New Lassie,” “Babylon 5,” “Harry and the Hendersons” and “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.” At a time when such disclosures were rare, Dow went public with his clinical depression in the 1980s and made self-help videos on accepting and dealing with the illness. Along with appearances in later years at pop culture conventions, often alongside Mather, Dow worked as an artist, gaining a sterling reputation as a sculptor. One of his bronze pieces was accepted at 2008′s Societe Nationale des Beaux-Arts, a 150-year-old art show staged annually at the Louvre. Dow told The Associated Press in 2012 that his openings brought out as many people anxious to rub shoulders with the Beaver’s big brother as to see his art. “I think it’s hard, especially with the Wally image, to be taken seriously at pretty much anything other than that,” he said with a chuckle and a shake of his head. Dow is survived by his wife of 42 years, Lauren, son Christopher, daughter-in-law Melissa, and brother Dion. KOOL 97.3 is a part of Alpha Media LLC.© 2024 Alpha Media LLC. All Rights Reserved.'}]"

Posted by Eric Stone | Aug 17, 2022 Drillers work on a rig at the Arctic Deposit in the Ambler Mining District in August 2022. (Courtesy of Ambler Metals, LLC) President Joe Biden signed the Democrats’ tax and climate package known as the Inflation Reduction Act into law this week. Among the law’s key provisions are a $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles — but only if the cobalt, graphite and other minerals in the EVs’ batteries come from domestic or friendly sources. Experts say that provision and others in the bill could spur mine development in Alaska. The Inflation Reduction Act offers $7,500 tax credits for people who buy new electric vehicles. But, as Paddy Ryan of the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center explains, there’s a pretty big catch. “There are about zero cars on the US market today that could potentially qualify for these credits,” Ryan said in an interview. That’s because starting in 2024, 40% of the metals used in electric vehicle battery production — cobalt, manganese, nickel, lithium and graphite — have to be either extracted or processed in the U.S. or a friendly country to qualify for the credit. That figure moves to 80% by 2027. And none can come from so-called “foreign entities of concern” — that’s diplomatese for China and Russia. “So essentially, the supply chain implications are the real story,” Ryan said. Most of the lithium used in the lithium-ion batteries that go into EVs comes from Australia and Chile, says economist Brett Watson at the University of Alaska Anchorage’s Institute of Social and Economic Research. “Those would qualify under the tax credit provisions, which require sourcing materials from nations that have a free trade agreement with the United States, which both of those nations do,” Watson said in an interview. But that’s not the case for some of the other minerals used in batteries. “Cobalt, on the other hand, is mostly sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo,” Watson said. The U.S. doesn’t have a free trade agreement with Congo. And that means EV manufacturers will have to source their cobalt elsewhere. Maybe from recycling. Or maybe from Alaska. “Cobalt is being prospected right now from the Ambler district,” Watson said. That’s a mining prospect in Northwest Alaska. And whether it’ll turn into a mine is far from a sure bet — the project has been mired in controversy for years. But the company hoping to develop the Ambler Mining District sees the Inflation Reduction Act as an encouraging sign. And not just because of the tax credits for cobalt. Ambler Metals President and CEO Ramzi Fawaz says the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits for “advanced manufacturing” are more important to his project in the short term. “What it boils down to is that the companies that are in mining can write off 10% of the cost of their operations if they produce one single critical mineral,” Fawaz said in an interview. There’s a long list of minerals that qualify — from aluminum to zinc. “Our first project will be called the Arctic project, and once we make a decision to invest and start construction, the mine will operate and mainly produce copper and zinc and other metals sometime in the late ‘20s,” Fawaz said. Cobalt production from the so-called Bornite Deposit would start much later. But will the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credit be enough to move the needle towards getting a mine built? “It’s a complex question, of course, because it does help, for sure,” Fawaz said. “But there are so many factors in making, realizing a project like ours.” Like, for example, whether a planned 200-plus-mile road to the mining district will move forward.

American tribes rolled out tough policies to combat it. The reason for the urgency goes back to a devastating history of disease that once wiped out upwards of half of tribal populations after the arrival of Europeans to the Americas. A new podcast produced at Wyoming Public Media connects the dots of the current COVID-19 pandemic with those historical ones. Wyoming Public Radio\'s Bob Beck sat down with The Modern Westpodcast\'s host Melodie Edwards and Shoshone and Arapaho descendant Taylar Stagner - one of the reporters on the series - to get behind the scenes on the making of ""Shall Furnish Medicine."" Bob Beck: Welcome to both of you. Melodie, how did this project come about? Melodie Edwards: Well, I had been talking to Savannah [Maher], who was our reporter covering the Wind River Reservation, and she had been working on covering the pandemic from the get-go. We kept having this situation where, when I would edit her, we both were kind of trying to figure out how to put context in because there\'s so much disease in Native American history. And so as we started kind of talking about it how the only way that we can really get into this is to try and do this through long-form storytelling, like podcasting. And so I reached out to her and she was game, and then we thought, \'Hey, we\'re going to need some help here.\' And so then we kind of hooked Taylar in to join us on this project. BB: Well, speaking of Savannah Maher, who\'s one of the reporters on this, she opens the series with a trip home for a traditional clambake during the pandemic. How\'d you make that happen? ME: Yeah, that was a little tricky. But we did have kind of like a window of time when the numbers were starting to plateau and all of her family had been vaccinated, she had been vaccinated. And so we were able to send her back to be able to participate in this in the ceremony. Which was just amazing, and just really brings the story to life, because she is from the Mashpee Wampanoag, one of the first tribes that had contact with Europeans, and was one of the first tribes that really felt the impact of disease. And so her storytelling is just very powerful. And I\'m so glad that we were able to make sure that she was able to go home to do that. BB: As I mentioned, Taylar Stagner is also joining us. Taylar, you interviewed one of your University of Wyoming professors for episode number one to help you trace the history of disease. Why\'d you pick him? And what did you learn from interviewing him? Taylar Stagner: Yeah, Jeff Means was my professor when I was getting my undergraduate [degree]. And I remember him being kind of a pivot point in my undergraduate [studies] about learning about my own tribes, and just about the broader history of disease in general. And so when Melodie came to me with this idea, I referred back to a lot of the articles and books that he taught us. And it really did ground us on a nice timeline from first contact - like when we start with Savannah - all the way up to going across the United States. So I really enjoyed talking with him again, BB: Taylar, why was it important to visit the [Fort Peck] health clinic as it\'s under construction? TS: At the time, I was the Indigenous Affairs reporter for Yellowstone Public Radio, and so I was covering all of the 12 tribal communities in Montana. And so while I was working on this, in my free time I was doing all this reporting anyway on COVID\'s effect on all these distinct tribes in Montana. And I caught wind of this wonderful wellness center going up on Fort Peck reservation in the northeast corner of Montana and it was just wonderful to go visit. It was a beautiful drive and it just really opened my eyes to how many different projects are going on in these tribal communities that center the whole person. It\'s not just about, \'Your arm is broken, let\'s fix the arm, let\'s get you out of here. Here\'s a huge doctor bill!\' These communities are taking care of people in a way that considers the whole person, body, and soul. What\'s your job situation look like? What\'s your spiritual situation look like? So just to go and to see people in the Assiniboine community, building the bricks and laying the framing of this health care center that\'s going to help the community so much, it was just so important for me to see the impact something like that was going to have on the community. BB: In episode number three, Savannah Maher includes interviews from across the Mountain West. How did you come by such rich audio? ME: Yeah, that episode was really amazing because Savannah actually had been the reporter on Wind River and then she ends up getting a job in Albuquerque and continues to cover the pandemic from there. So she has this wide range of opportunities where she was covering the pandemic from the minutes that it started on Wind River in Wyoming. And then she was able to go and do lots and lots of interviews as well on the Navajo Reservation and interviewed all sorts of people just across the Mountain West who are really experiencing this up close and personal. And she was able to document the chronology of it as it happened. And the main thing that was amazing about Savannah\'s reporting was just that she made sure that she centered all of it with real people\'s lives. We still got to hear lots and lots of administrators and doctors and all of those kinds of folks as well. But she really made sure that she found families and talked to them and really made their lives the focus of her reporting. And that was what made that episode just a really heart-wrenching and beautiful exploration of how this pandemic unfolded. BB: Also, tell me about all the artists you brought together for this project? ME: Yeah, that was one of the cool things about this project. And I\'m gonna have to pass this back to Taylar because she helped me so much. These were all connections that she had. But we were really excited because when we got the Pulitzer Center grant, one of the things that we made sure we budgeted was funds for artists to make sure that we had Native American illustrators, actors, musicians…. I kind of had that in the back of my mind from the get go that I really wanted to make sure that we had as many Native American voices top to bottom on this project. TS: Well, I did a piece for Wyoming Public Radio about a comic book set on the Wind River Reservation in the Shoshone community, and that was written and illustrated by Zach Kennah. He\'s a descendant. So it\'s a beautifully illustrated horror comic that I did a few months before we decided to do this project. So we brought him on to do all the wonderful illustrations for the piece. And then my friend Sean Francis, who\'s Shoshone as well, he owns Fremont Music over [in] Lander. We\'ve always been talking about doing a project together. So he did all the music. He\'s a very, very talented guitarist, percussionist, songwriter. He has his own music projects going on on the Wind River right now. He\'s just incredible and it was just really nice to see all these people come together on this project.
