In his announcement, Robert Nutting, CEO of Ogden Newspapers and The Nutting Co., reiterated his family’s commitment to the industry and the critical role of community newspapers. The deal is scheduled to close Dec. 31, and with the acquisition Ogden Newspapers will publish 54 daily newspapers and a number of weekly newspapers and magazines in 18 states. Founded in 1975, the second- and third-generation family-owned Swift Communications has operated magazines, newspapers, websites, book publishing and other digital products in Western state cities. In Colorado, that includes The Aspen Times and Snowmass Sun, Glenwood Springs Post Independent, Vail Daily, Summit Daily News, Steamboat Pilot & Today, Craig Press and Sky-Hi News near Winter Park. The Eagle Valley Enterprise, the longest-running business in Eagle County, is also part of the sale. Swift also included publications and offices in Park City, Utah; Lake Tahoe and Grass Valley, California; and Carson City, Nevada. “The publications, communities and most of all the great people who have been a part of our company since its founding in 1975 will be very much missed,” Bill Waters, CEO and chairman of the board of Swift Communications, said in the announcement. “We know the time has come to pass the baton of stewardship to new owners who can carry forward the important mission.” Ogden Newspapers will continue Swift’s focus on publishing newspapers that provide unique and compelling local content to readers and value to the newspaper’s business partners, Nutting added. “I will miss working with the Swift leadership team, especially Bob Brown, who has been a great mentor and partner,” Vail Daily Publisher Mark Wurzer said. “I am pleased we are being acquired by a company like Ogden Newspapers. Throughout their 130-year history as a five-generation family owned media company, Ogden has demonstrated the same commitment to local autonomy, staff, local journalism, helping businesses and supporting communities in the way Swift has since 1975.” That came as good news to local residents reached for this story. Vail Town Council member Kim Langmaid as a youngster delivered some of the first editions of the Vail Daily when it was one photocopied sheet of paper. Since then, Langmaid has dealt with the Daily as an educator, an entrepreneur and elected officials. “The Vail Daily has always been a partner … you do a great job keeping tabs on things,” Landmaid said, adding she hopes that continues. Trevor Theelke of Land Title Guarantee Co. said he also hopes the Daily continues its focus on local news and events. “You can always read different papers online, but when you’re looking for that local information, you go to the Daily,” Theelke said. Nutting said Ogden intends to keep that focus on local news, for readers, advertisers and community members. “We also are excited for the opportunity to work with and serve the businesses in these markets to help them continue to get their message in front of customers,” Nutting said. “Our company’s goal is to be a positive force in the communities we serve — celebrating each market’s unique strengths while also working to provide realistic solutions to areas of concern. We believe that strong, responsible and connected local newspapers are critically important to building and supporting strong communities now more than ever.” Eagle River Watershed Council Director Holly Loff said that local presence depends on people living in the communities they cover. “You’re all members of this community,” Loff said of the current Vail Daily staff. “We see all of you out and about … it feels like I can talk with all of you.” At the moment, it looks like most Swift employees will continue in their roles.

Lawlessness was a way of life for many in those early days and like the song by Jim Croce, “Bad, Bad Leroy Brown” the San Luis Valley had a bad, bad LeRoy of its own. According to accounts provided by the Rio Grande County Museum, this story begins with a troubled youth that would grow into a famous, well-known outlaw that was a bad as they came. The LeRoy Brothers also known as the Colorado Highwaymen, dates to the late-1800s when a young lad by the name of William Pond whose alias later became Billy LeRoy. LeRoy was also known as Billy the Kid, Colorado Highwayman, Sam Pond or Sam Potter. No matter which name he was using at the time, Billy LeRoy grew up in Indianapolis, Ind. During his childhood, Billy was a neighborhood nuisance. He was the first to raid neighborhood hen roosts and orchards according to a historical account of Billy’s life written by a local historian. After developing a taste for a life of crime, Billy quickly moved from bothering his neighborhood to a juvenile outlaw. Many who recounted Billy’s younger years often said they wished he would do time in prison or even become what they referred to as a “juvenile angel,” meaning they wanted him dead. All of this sent Billy down a road that ultimately led him and his brother to an early death. Billy came to the San Luis Valley after a strange and wavering path. Once Indianapolis law enforcement had it out to arrest of Billy, he decided it was high time to hit the rails and head West, where he planned to become a famous outlaw. Billy was arrested by law enforcement in Indianapolis but weaseled out of the handcuffs that held him and escaped by jumping out of a two-story window. On his way to Colorado, Billy encountered several hardened criminals that not only helped him reach his destination, but also taught him the ins and outs of a life of crime. During his trek heading West, Billy met an unsavory character who named himself California Bill also known as William Miner. Miner lit a spark inside Billy and taught him the fundamentals of theft and later the two stopped the Alpine-Gunnison stage but only got away with $50 in cash. The next stage the two robbed was on Slumgullion Pass on Oct. 7, 1880 and this time, they made out with $100 which back then was quite an accomplishment. Back in these days, many of the roads we travel today began as stagecoach routes. Trains had yet to make a huge impact on communities like those in the San Luis Valley. Only one week later, Billy and his partner in crime the infamous California Bill first showed their faces in the San Luis Valley robbing the stage between Alamosa and Del Norte. It was during this robbery that Billy made a name for himself and was now a wanted man. The two made out with $4,000 in cash and other priceless trinkets. It was at this time that the two split ways and Billy, knowing the law was hot on his tail headed back East to Chicago after a brief stop in Pueblo.

Over the course of this past September, Doubrava pushed his body’s limits in order to raise funds for Stop Soldier Suicide, a nonprofit — founded by three U.S. Army veterans — that aims to raise donations toward mental and behavioral health resources to veterans. According to Stop Soldier Suicide, veterans are at a 50% higher risk of suicide than people who have not served in the armed forces. Since 2001, more than 114,000 veterans have died by suicide. “(Running 100 miles) was one way for me to give back,” Doubrava said. “I had a lot of family and friends that have served in the military, and I have lost several friends to PTSD and suicide. It was kind of a big personal goal to help others in the community, other than doing work with EMS. If the money that I raised helped just one person, that’s what is important.” Research from SSS also says that, depending on the branch of the military, up to 31% of service members develop post traumatic stress disorder after returning from combat. Despite the physical toll, keeping on track toward the final miles was one of the hardest parts of the journey, Doubrava said. On average, runners who take the challenge have to average 3.3 miles per day to finish by the end of the month, so when a day is missed, those miles must be made up on another day to stay on track. Doubrava said weekends were dedicated to longer runs, and, on some of those days, he had to run upwards of 10 miles each day. With his dog Oakley, Doubrava tackled those make-up hours and squeezed in extra running early in the mornings or on lunch breaks. For a lot of the runs, Doubrava said that he used those times as meditation and as stress relief. However, he said briefly there was a moment where he thought about giving up. “It was about halfway through September,” Doubrava said. “LIfe was getting busy, and I was only halfway through at day 17 and was already behind a few miles. I logged into the fundraiser and saw people donating and seeing how proud they were, it motivated me.” Community support is what kept him going, Doubrava said. On social media, he saw posts and pictures of himself running for the project, and he said on several occasions other community members would honk and wave to him while he got a few miles in. The community also pushed Doubrava to raise past his fundraising goal. He set a goal of raising $200, but by the end of the project, he had raised a total of $620. In addition to raising money, Doubrava said raising awareness for mental health and the stigma around it was just as important. He added that, in order to help save lives, it was crucial that negative stigmas around talking about mental health are eliminated. He said that anyone should be able to feel comfortable expressing to loved ones when they are not OK. “No matter where you are in life — if you’re struggling financially, emotionally, with friends or family — there’s always someone that cares. They could be a silent supporter. There’s always someone willing to help,” Doubrava said. “Seeing the impact that suicide has brought to families is tremendous. It impacts their coworkers, their friends, hundreds of people. If you can prevent that one thing, it also prevents trauma to family and friends.

Please give us a call at 970-874-4421 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy How are things going at Ela Family Farms in Hotchkiss? That’s a question a number of people have been asking following last fall’s devastating freeze. “For the temperatures to plunge down to 3 degrees, the trees just weren’t ready for it,” said Regan Choi, assistant manager. “It had a hard impact on a lot of different variety of trees. The trees that were the most active at that time of the year were the ones that got hit the hardest.” The 80-acre farm in Hotchkiss is known far and wide for its over 55 different varieties of produce including apples, cherries, peaches, pears and plums. It also has a number of varieties of heirloom tomatoes and rhubarb. Steve Ela, owner and fourth generation farmer, said they will definitely have less fruit this season due to the frost and continuing severe drought. “It’s not a lot, but some is better than none.” The plums that mature later in the season took the brunt of the freeze; however, the variety that produces earlier survived and should produce a crop this year. The cherry trees on mature block where 90% wiped out and what survived probably won’t produce a crop. “They were so devastated that they may not have the resources to keep going,” Choi said, explaining that during fall and winter trees reabsorb nutrients from their leaves. They then use the nutrients to kickstart the next season. To make matters worse a previous freeze in the fall of 2019 had already caused damage to the tree’s ability to reabsorb nutrients. And there’s always the spring freezes to worry about, they can last until the end of May. “My take is, it’s really hard to lose crop before you’ve even finished the previous one. It’s kind of unfair,” Ela said about the past two seasons. Despite all the heartache, there’s been “deep rooted support” that’s kept hope alive for the 100% organic farm on Rogers Mesa. “The support from people far and wide has been truly stunning. We’ve gotten letters from folks who’ve said, ‘if you’re willing to do this incredibly risky, hard job, we want to help you out,’” she said. Word of the devastation got out through Ela Family Farms’s partnerships with Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) starting a new chapter of doing things a bit differently. While supporters continued to purchase CSA shares, not expecting anything in return, Ela Family Farms didn’t want to collect donations without offering something in return. It started offering custom tours of the orchard, lunch with a farmer sessions and a unique opportunity to adopt a tree or trees. “We didn’t know if we would have any fruit at all. If this freeze was so bad that it killed fully mature trees, there might not be a single piece of fruit that’s going to make it through,” Choi said, “We’ll just have to wait until spring.” Months following the freeze there’s still an air of uncertainty at the orchard, but hope is beginning to blossom with each new passing day. With the birds chirping in the background, I walked through the mixture of dead and live orchard blocks with Choi and Ela. Since the freeze they’ve planted and pruned 1,100 peach trees, most adopted by loyal supporters. Choi said the adoption name tags are being tied to the new trees and the 3-year-old peach block is alive. And best of all Ela’s will have some early plums this year all thanks to some “deep rooted support” from everyone who loves the orchards. Over time support has grown from a few hundred to over 14,000 views on the Facebook page and word has spread via shared newspaper clippings from Colorado to the northern hemisphere.

The electrified nature of the sculpture — its eyes shine at night, one of Jimenez’ artistic signatures — and the fact that it fell on and killed its creator during fabrication in 2006 have supplied endless lore for storytellers.Depictions of “Mustang” span comics and literature, bathroom stall stickers and band T-shirts. But there’s a good reason why we’ve only seen Blucifer — and, to a lesser extent, accurate depictions of the real “Mustang” — as unlicensed, small-scale riffs over the years.

LOGIN » By: Priscilla Waggoner Updated: 2 years ago / Posted Jul 24, 2021 SAN LUIS — Every small town has its own unique characteristics. But the town of San Luis, Colorado is, in many ways, in a class all its own. Known for being the oldest town in the state, San Luis is also the home of R&R Market, Colorado’s oldest business, established in 1857. With its colorful storefront that is indicative of the warmth and friendliness found inside, R&R Market is a local institution with a hard-and-well-earned reputation for surviving despite the odds. As one visitor from Boulder commented on Facebook, “Wow. Nineteen years before statehood. Four years before Colorado became a territory. Someone must’ve been pretty tough.” Tough? Yes. Resilient? Definitely. Life in the San Luis Valley is not always easy. But the community of San Luis is also known for being tight-knit. A town populated by, in some cases, family lines that go back four generations and where people generally look out for each other, both qualities that are rare in many communities these days. San Luis, like other places in the valley, even has its own dialect. According to former Spanish teacher and San Luis Valley native, Sam Armijo, “Some people in San Luis add an ‘i’ to the end of their words. Instead of saying ‘esta noche’, they say ‘esta nochi’. Some even say San Luisi.” He laughs in appreciation. “You have to listen closely to hear it, but it’s there. It’s delightful.” While this village of less than 700 people nestled at the foot of the Sangre de Cristos may seem to be a quiet, unassuming place, it is also the home of true treasures, not the least of which are the famous Stations of the Cross, each one captured in life-size bronze sculptures created with excruciating and glorious beauty by internationally known artist Huberto Maestas. The trail of the Stations of the Cross leads up La Mesa de la Piedad y de la Misericordia (the Hill of Piety and Mercy) and comes to an end La Capilla de Todos Los Santos (the Chapel of All Saints), a stunning structure of architectural beauty that looks out over San Luis and the valley beyond. Of course, to the people of San Luis and the San Luis Valley, at large, none of this is news. And neither is it news that this weekend celebration Fiesta de Santiago y Santa Ana. But both things bear repeating. This time-honored tradition is in its 170th year and, as described on the town’s website, www.townofsanluis.org , is “a gathering of local generations to enjoy church events, authentic food, traditional music and most importantly, fun and community fellowship, while honoring the cultural uniqueness and heritage of San Luis, the oldest town in Colorado, and its surrounding villages.” Held from Friday, July 23rd through Sunday, July 25th -- and often attended by many people who have moved away from San Luis but return home for the occasion -- Fiesta de Santiago y Santa Ana will include performances by “Cuarenta y Cinco”, “Jerry Dean”, “Blue Ventures”, Semillas de la Tierra Folklorico Dancing, a car show, two parades, a procession and mass in Chama, a Mariachi Mass in El Convento in San Luis, a book signing and talk by the author, a 5k run and a glorious time of food, fellowship and entertainment.

The Broncos drive other football coaches in this town completely bananas, too, sometimes. Especially when Jerry Jeudy’s name comes up.I happened to be kibitzing with one of those coaches about something else last fall when the conversation turned, on a dime, to Jeudy. To how the Broncos should be using their new toy. And weren’t.“If I ran that offense, I’d find ways,” this coach said, almost laughing with exasperation. “I’d get creative. Direct snap it. Do something. I mean, how can you not get the ball in that guy’s hands?”Easy. Have Drew Lock throw it at him.OK, we kid, we kid. But the point remains: The Broncos already wasted a season of No. 10 once. We’ve seen that movie, and nobody wants to sit through a sequel. Jeudy, least of all.“You don’t know what you’re getting yourself into (in) your first year of doing something,” Jeudy, the Broncos’ gifted wide receiver and the franchise’s first-round pick in 2020, said recently. “I know how to overcome whatever I had in past years to make this year better.”He can’t overcome a ball thrown six yards to his left. Or eight yards over his head.According to the wonks at Pro Football Focus, Jeudy was one of only six players last fall for whom more than 20% of their incomplete targets were because of the quarterback — a league-high 24%, in No. 10’s case. The site decreed that he was one of eight wideouts with more than 10 “uncatchable” deep ball targets (14, in this case) and one of nine receivers with five or more “uncatchable” targets in the end zone. The feet? Money. The hips? Lightning. The separation? Divine. The hands? Meh. But it wasn’t all on him, either. PFF said Jeudy wound up as one of only five wideouts in 2020 who saw a “catchable” ball while open or wide open fewer than 85% of the time (81%).Which means whether it’s via Lock’s lasers, Teddy Bridgewater’s touch or Aaron Rodgers’ mojo, until Dove Valley lands a quarterback who can find No. 10 consistently, the Broncos will never know what they’ve got in Jeudy. None of us will.“He’s really taken what we saw last year in practice and in games and really worked on it,” offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur said during June mini-camp. “Jerry has been out there being very competitive. He’s made his plays and I can see growth every day.”Jeudy’s being targeted again, only this time as a “sleeper” breakout candidate on an offense that could use a few. He stomped the spring. He’s crushing Instagram. Fellow wideout Courtland Sutton looks good, so far, coming off a torn ACL, and the presence of a healthy Sutton means Jeudy won’t be covered by No. 1 cornerbacks as often, if ever.No. 10 got chucked into the deep end as a rookie. When he swam, it was gorgeous, that 92-yard catch-and run against the Raiders in the season finale being the prettiest of the bunch.It was the sinking moments that irked you. The Post’s Ryan O’Halloran charted Jeudy with a team-high 10 dropped passes in 2020. On third down, the former Alabama star got targeted 37 times. He caught 18 of those, for a ratio of just 48.6%. When the Broncos were trailing within the final four minutes of a game, he was targeted 13 times, catching five of the throws for a ratio of 38.5%.Sutton in 2019 sported a 55.0% catch ratio on third down and an 87.5% mark in the final four minutes of a game in which Denver was trailing. If you’re Bridgewater or Lock, which guy are you more likely to trust in a pinch?“I’m so quick to catch and run to hurry up and make a play instead of catching first, then run,” Jeudy explained. “That’s mostly what (it was), just trying to make a play too fast and not focusing on the bigger picture.”That picture isn’t charitable to 2020 Drew Lock, whom Pro-Football-Reference credited with a “bad throw percentage” of 22.9% and an “on-target percentage” at 68.9% a season ago. Bridgewater last autumn checked in at 13.0% and 80.5%, respectively, with the Panthers.Rodgers, meanwhile, posted a bad-throw mark of 13.8% and an on-target percentage of 81.2% with Green Bay in 2020, making Lock the clearest — and most damning — outlier of the three.“I know Jeudy is on a mission to be the best,” Broncos left tackle Garett Bolles said of the young wideout. “I know you guys dog him for last year, but that man is a freak. We need to give him the respect he deserves, because that’s what’s going to happen.”Groovy. But respect, like the passing game, is a two-way street. And none of Jeudy’s freaky side is going to matter if nobody can get the dang ball in his mitts.

EarthTalk: What’s the latest on hydrogen powered fuel cells? Not long ago they were touted as the energy source of the future, but news has been scant of late. J. Gorman, Columbia, SC Indeed, around the turn of the millennium, the development of hydrogen fuel cells to power our transportation sector with renewable, non-polluting power was all the rage among environmentalists and techies alike. Fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen via an electrochemical reaction to make electricity, with water as the only “exhaust.” The first crude fuel cells were invented in England in the 1830s, but the technology really gained momentum in the 1960s when NASA developed them for the space program. Unlike traditional batteries, which need to be regularly recharged, fuel cells operate continuously as long as they have a steady supply of oxygen and hydrogen. Oxygen is available anywhere and anytime from the air around us. Hydrogen, though also one of the planet’s most common elements, isn’t easily separated from the compound molecules it is usually part of. So, either gasification or electrolysis are used to separate the hydrogen out. But this requires copious amounts of energy, which is most often derived from fossil fuel sources, calling into question just how sustainable fuel cells actually may be. Start-ups working on fuel cells for the auto industry (Ballard Power, Plug Power) became the darlings of investors in the 1990s and 2000s, but in the intervening two decades hybrids and EVs started to take over the auto sector instead of cars powered by hydrogen, and fuel cell makers shifted most of their attention to the aviation industry. So, what happened? Why aren’t we all driving around in fuel cell cars today? One major hurdle was the lack of a refueling infrastructure. Internal combustion cars and trucks (and hybrids) can get gasoline at just about every other corner and highway exit across the country. Meanwhile, EV drivers just need an electrical outlet, one of the most ubiquitous pieces of “infrastructure” in our world, to recharge their cars’ batteries for the next 80-200 miles. But if you do happen to drive one of the 300 fuel cell vehicles sold (or leased) in the U.S. in recent years—Toyota Mirai or Honda Clarity, to name a few, you’ll have to find a hydrogen refueling station to keep the road trip alive. And if you don’t live in California, home to 43 of the nation’s 48 hydrogen refueling stations thanks to the forward-looking state’s Clean Transportation Program, a fuel cell vehicle probably doesn’t make a lot of sense. While fuel cells may not have lived up to their initial hype as the future of the automotive transportation sector, they are playing an increasingly larger role in powering various aspects of the aviation and aerospace industries, where hydrogen production and refueling operations can be relatively centralized. Another growth area for fuel cells is stationary applications. Our existing natural gas distribution system could be modified to pipe hydrogen into our buildings to feed fuel cells to take care of our energy needs. While fuel cells alone may not be the answer to our environmental problems, they are proving to be one of the arrows in the quiver of those trying to be part of the solution.

(Planet file photo) If there were a single person whose being captured the essence of Telluride, it would be William “Senior” Mahoney. A hard-rock miner turned ski pioneer turned local historian, Mahoney possessed the steely grit, adventurous spirit and boundless determination credited for steering Telluride from fading mining town to lively ski resort. Mahoney passed away Friday from COVID-19 complications at his home in Montrose. He was 92. Mahoney, who was born in Bonanza, Colorado, moved to Telluride with his family in 1930 at the age of 2. The son of Telluride Marshal and San Miguel County Sheriff Tom Mahoney and his wife Frieda, Mahoney, along with his five brothers, grew up rambling across the mountains surrounding Telluride, often with a pair of rough-hewn wooden skis strapped to their feet. He started skiing on the rope tows erected on Firecracker Hill and Grizzly Gulch (now known as Kid’s Hill), then towing behind cars on Telluride’s snow-packed streets. Soon after Mahoney was exploring the loftier peaks and basins in the region. From the flanks of Mt. Sneffels to La Junta Basin to Swamp and Waterfall canyons; Bridal Veil and Lena basins to terrain off the Tomboy and Blixt roads; Prospect Basin and even the flanks of Ajax Mountain, Mahoney grew into adulthood with a passion for skiing set deep in his bones. Remembered as a dyed-in-the-wool explorer who captured many of his alpine exploits on 16mm home movie reels, Mahoney played the leading role in many local history chronicles, including “We Skied It,” a film that explores the history of skiing in Telluride from the 1920s into the 1970s. A permanent exhibit is named in his honor at the Telluride Historical Museum, with many artifacts donated by Mahoney and his family. The highest run on the Telluride Ski Area, atop the daunting Palmyra Peak, is aptly named “Senior’s” after the man most credited for putting skiing on the map for Telluride. “While we will miss Dad, we are happy he gets to rejoin his cherished friends that went before him, including his best friend and brother Bob,” his son Junior Mahoney said of his father’s passing. Mahoney started working at the Idarado Mine at age 15. His job was to unload the ore buckets from the aerial trams, and he and his brothers figured out that those same trams were good vehicles for accessing snowy slopes and soon started bringing their skis to work. After high school he enrolled in the Navy, and following two years abroad, he returned to Telluride to work in the mines and marry his high school sweetheart Twylla.

Please give us a call at 970-874-4421 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Make some time for some light reading over the summer months. You just might learn something to help you with your outdoor passions. During the time I was incarcerated in the sixth grade, the teacher assigned the class books to read. After reading these books, we were required to write a book report, highlighting the details of the book. The books the teacher selected for me were so boring, that there was absolutely no way I could get through it. The only books I ever read were fishing and hunting magazines, and I did not care about a girl named Charlotte and some silly spider. I decided it was a lost cause and took my lumps with a bad grade. The teacher saw differently and assigned a book about fishing that she was sure would hold my attention. The book was called “The Compleat Angler” by Izaak Walton and written in 1653. Walton spent 25 years adding to, changing, and editing his book. It will take me longer than that to read it. On some rainy afternoon, curled up on the couch with that book. After an hour or so, let’s see you try and uncurl. As I got older, I began to appreciate books, especially the classics related to the outdoors. Authors who wrote hunting and fishing stories, like Robert Ruark, Ernest Hemmingway and Peter Hathaway Capstick, are among my favorites. Reading is good for you as well. Research has proven that regular reading improves brain connectivity, increases language and reasoning skills, and keeps you mentally alert as you age. Regular reading is also helpful to you by increasing your vocabulary and comprehension skills. I also like to read books that help me perform better in the outdoor sports I enjoy, including fishing, hunting, camping and hiking. Recently, I read a few books and thought I would share them with you. “How To Stay Alive In The Woods” by Bradford Angier, Black Dog and Leventhal; Revised Nov. 1, 2001 This book was written by a man known as “The Master Backwoodsman” in 1956. It is a classic and a must read for anyone who ventures off the beaten path into the woods. Fully illustrated, it covers everything from finding food, shelter, warmth and water, when lost or stranded. Some of the information may be somewhat outdated, but the basics are not presented better in any book I have ever found. I first read this book as a teenager and have gone through it several times. He talks about an “Indian camp” and the pleasure of spending a night in one. I followed his advice on several occasions, and he was right. “Wilderness And Travel Medicine” By Eric A. Weiss, M.D., Mountaineers Books, fourth Ed. 2011 This book was originally written in 1992 but has been updated numerous times since. It covers everything you need to know about injuries and illnesses when in the wilderness or while travelling. He will help you create a kit, with necessary medicines for whatever adventure you may wish to take. He discusses just about any injury or symptom you might encounter and offers “Weiss advice” to help you through the problem. The book also has a section of “when to worry” and what symptoms require immediate evacuation or advanced medical attention. I carry this book in my kit whenever I travel. Along with some medicines and medical supplies, it is like having my personal physician along with me. “The Easy Camp Cookbook” by Amelia Mayer, Rockridge Press Nov. 10, 2020 I am the world’s worst camp chef. I don’t know how to cook food that is edible, let alone healthy, while camping out. My ideal lunch is half a bag of Oreo cookies (I save the other half for dinner). With this book, there is no longer an excuse. Camping meals can be fun, delicious, and healthy. The author will walk you through the process of how much food to buy, how to store it, and what preparations can be done before you head for camp. Everything is set up in a format that does not require you to be a master chef to put the meal together. Not only is the book fun, it shows ways to get the entire family involved in the meal process. The book is small and compact but with a very large collection of recipes for your campfire. “Sapphire’s Soul Tools: A Beginners Guide To Spiritual Living” by Sapphire Waters, Awakened Moments Nov. 11, 2020 I must disclose to you that this book was written by my daughter who lives in Olathe. I include it in what I consider necessary reading for anyone who loves the outdoors. People who are passionate about the outdoors know the benefits of being outside. It is more than fresh air that we benefit from being in the wild. This book will teach you to free your soul, learn how to deal with your problems, and appreciate the little things while not being burdened with the bad things of your past. By learning how to deal with problems, you become calmer in an emergency, and search for solutions with a logical mind. This book will walk you through the process of discovering your spiritual self and carrying that spiritualism with you in the great outdoors. You might even find a chapter in the book that discusses yours truly. Every chapter is not for everybody, but everybody can benefit from this book in some way. “Into The Wild” by Jon Krakauer Anchor Books Feb. 1, 1997 This is the story of Christopher McCandless, a college educated man, who abandoned everything to pursue the Alaskan Odyssey, and ended up starving to death. He found the “Magic Bus” which led to others making a pilgrimage to visit the site where this took place. McCandless thought he was a master at survival but that proved to be a deadly mistake. By the time you finish the story, you will have a mixture of feelings about McCandless. He was a sympathetic, magnetic and courageous idealist, and a reckless idiot. You decide. It is a wilderness story worth the read. All of these books are available at the countless on-line bookstores, including amazon.com. Even though it has now been 50 years, I still have not finished reading The Compleat Angler, and I realize that Walton was not so hot as a speller. Thinking about it, I still owe my teacher a book report.

organizing, and CEO Elon Musk must delete an “unlawful” 2018 tweet that “coercively threatened” workers with loss of stock options if they unionized, an order this week from the National Labor Relations Board said.The decision from the federal workplace regulator came down Thursday. As of noon Friday, Musk’s tweet — “Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing?” — remained live.Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A three-member panel of the board found that Tesla in 2017 illegally interrogated three workers attempting to unionize over claimed safety concerns at the Palo Alto electric car company’s Fremont plant, illegally fired one of them, and in 2016 forced employees to sign a confidentiality agreement that violated the law by banning them from talking to the media about working conditions.A study commissioned by Tesla workers and released in 2017 said data from California’s worker-safety agency showed recorded injuries at the Fremont plant were 31% higher than the average auto factory. Tesla acknowledged to this news organization at the time that long work hours and pressure to meet delivery goals created taxing conditions at the plant, but said it had made broad changes and improved safety.This month, Alameda County released data showing that more than 400 coronavirus cases have been reported at the Fremont plant since it reopened in violation of county health orders last May. Tesla, which had shut down the plant in March 2020, issued a “Return to Work Playbook” that said the firm was “fully dedicated to the safety, health and well-being of the Tesla team.” The document outlined safety protocols Tesla said were based on guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the World Health Organization and regional health authorities.The National Labor Relations Board also ordered Tesla to post a notice at the Fremont plant in “conspicuous places” for 60 days reminding workers of their right to unionize and telling them that the company won’t make any rules barring them from talking to the press about workplace conditions or distributing union literature in their off hours in the company parking lot. The notice must also say Tesla won’t interrogate anyone about unionizing and won’t fire, discipline, or discriminate against union-supporting employees, or threaten any loss of benefits for workers voting to unionize.The notice must also include a statement that Tesla will make Musk delete the tweet, the order said. The labor-relations board noted that Tesla had argued the tweet was protected under the U.S. Constitution’s free-speech 1st Amendment, but cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that a statement loses that protection if based on misrepresentation of the consequences of union bargaining. A separate notice, also reminding workers of their right to unionize and saying Tesla won’t threaten employees with loss of benefits if they vote to join a union, must be posted at all company facilities nation-wide.
