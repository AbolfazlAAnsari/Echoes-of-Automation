Brett joined the NewsWatch 12 team as a reporter in July of 2020. MEDFORD, Ore. -- After the Medford City Council\'s narrow passing of Council Bill 2023-23 Thursday night, NewsWatch 12 reached out to several tribes across Southern Oregon & Northern California to hear their reaction to the change. Back in 2013, the city council passed Resolution 2013-68, which declared a position of opposition to the Coquille Indian Tribe’s fee-to-trust application to the United States Department of the Interior to build a casino in Medford. However, during last night\'s meeting, that position of opposition changed to neutral when the council voted in favor 5-3. On Friday NewsWatch 12 reached out to the Cow Creek, Karuk and Klamath Tribes to get their response to the change. All three informed NewsWatch 12 they implored the city, either during the comment period or while at last night\'s meeting, to maintain their status of opposition. Although the council\'s decision does not officially play a role in the federal government\'s final decision of approval or denial, some tribes believe the change could make a difference. ""I don\'t want to speak for the (Bureau of Indian Affairs) or the City of Medford, but I\'m sure it will be something that the BIA would consider when they make their decision,"" said Klamath Tribes\' Chairmen Clay Dumont. For the last decade, the Coquille Tribe has been working towards building a casino in Medford which they say would be used to help their tribe, along with creating new jobs and revenue for the city. But for other surrounding tribes like the Cow Creek, Klamath and Karuk Tribes, a new casino located in Medford could be devastating for them. As it stands now, all three tribes rely heavily on the business generated by those that travel to their casinos from Medford and the surrounding Jackson County communities. ""Our casino would lose 25% of our profit and that\'s being conservative,"" said Jessica Bochart with the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians. ""We figure it will be much, much more. It\'d mean a loss of jobs by not only tribal citizens, but by a lot of Oregonians. It would mean we would have a huge funding deficit for our tribal programs, which supports our education, healthcare, housing and elder support."" For the Karuk Tribe, the impacts could be very similar for them in Yreka at the Rain Rock Casino. However, the worst potential impacts could be seen towards the east in Klamath County. On Friday, NewsWatch 12 spoke with the tribe\'s chairman, Clay Dumont, who told us that in a best-case scenario, the tribe could see between a 16-to-20% decline in business at the Kla-Mo-Ya. But, if the worst were to happen... ""We\'re seeing numbers as high as 50% and, yeah, it could close us,"" Dumont said. ""We\'re not a big operation, but we\'re very dependent on that."" Although an approval for a Medford casino by the federal government could potentially doom them, Dumont says the move by the Coquille Tribe is not a ""personal thing, it\'s just survival."" However even if that\'s the case, tribes like the Klamath, Cow Creek and Karuk agree that an approval by the federal government on this matter would be unprecedented. In Oregon, only one tribe (Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians) has two casinos located within two different counties. An approval by the federal government would make them the second Tribe to have two casinos that would be more than 160 miles apart. NewsWatch 12 reached out to the Coquille Tribe for comment on the proposed Medford Casino and did not get a response. A final decision on the Coquille Tribe\'s application to build a casino in Medford has not been set and may not be decided on for several more months or even years.

Tina Kotek wrote a letter to the Oregon Tribal Chairs on Thursday explaining her stance on tribal gaming -- and her opposition to the Coquille Tribe\'s proposed Medford casino. Gov.

(KPTV) - As more decisions are made regarding COVID-19, there is plenty of information and misinformation being presented about the virus. FOX 12 Investigators sat down for an in-depth conversation with an expert in viruses at Portland State University to talk about COVID-19 and what we can expect going forward. With regard to how this virus is behaving, Ken Stedman said people often turn to the number of people who have died. Scientists measure that as a case-to-fatality ratio: How many people are dying compared to how many got sick. Right now, as of Thursday, the virus is seven times deadlier than the seasonal flu. However, Stedman said it’s a lot less deadly than the last major coronavirus outbreaks, SARS and MERS. “Two major difference in terms of symptoms. The main one is that both SARS and MERS are much more deadly. SARS is about a 10% case/fatality ratio. Not a rate. MERS is actually about 30%. But those viruses are really poor at transmitting from human to human,” Stedman said. Stedman said COVID-19 spreads easier between people than SARS and MERS, but it’s not nearly as deadly as those conditions. “One thing to remember is that 80% of people actually have pretty mild disease,” Stedman said about COVID-19. “And if anything, I think that number is probably going to be higher, higher than 80% who have very low amounts of disease, just because, again, we’ve just been testing the people who already have symptoms.” Typically, with viruses, you hear that the most vulnerable are the very young and the very old. With this virus, it seems to be particularly dangerous for older people and those with compromised immune systems, but Stedman said it seems children are less affected by COVID-19. The reason for that isn’t yet clear. “They’re not getting sick, which is great. But at the same time, why is that? So people are actually trying to use that information now to understand how we might be able to treat the disease. Understand what it is about the kids that makes them resistant to the disease,” Stedman said. So how’d we get here? “One way we could have prepared a lot better for this is that there was SARS in 2003. That was what, 17 years ago now? We could have developed some anti-coronavirus medicines since then. We haven’t. Or we didn’t, I should say,” Stedman said. A vaccine may be more than a year away, but, as a general statement, Stedman said don’t panic. “So what I would say, and I’ve said this a number of times before, be prepared. Don’t be scared. So it’s clearly a big issue and it’s something we need to think about, but being scared, being panicked about it is really exactly the wrong thing to be doing,” he said.
