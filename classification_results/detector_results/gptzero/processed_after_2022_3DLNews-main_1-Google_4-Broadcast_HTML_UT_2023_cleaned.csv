Each Christmas the city hosts a city-wide Christmas party where everyone in the community is invited to spend time with friends and neighbors. There were lots of road projects that took place this year and a lot of citizens were pleased with the outcome. “You got the east side of Center Street we paved and pretty nice layer down and try to make it a little smoother. We got our 5th South project paved, and curb and gutter, sidewalk all put in, that project is done all the way to 4th West. Those were are two main projects.

That’s one of our wishes that we can do and hopefully everybody does it, so we can get it done,” said Mayor Norton. He finished by wishing all residents in Huntington City a Happy & Safe New Year’s holiday.'}]"

Tim Ballard has made national headlines as the inspiration for the movie “Sound of Freedom,” but officials say he used the names of Church leaders without authorization. Vice News published an article on Friday, reporting Tim Ballard regularly met with Acting President of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, Elder M. Russell Ballard. Vice reported that Ballard claimed Elder Ballard - who are not related - kept in close contact about rescue missions, and that Elder Ballard was a partner in a for-profit venture called “Slave Stealers,” which would have controlled OUR and other non-profits to monetize the attention raised by OUR rescue missions. Vice reported that Ballard’s main goal was to use the “sizzle” from these rescue missions to draw people to the Latter-day Saints faith. The article reads, “Tim Ballard also claimed, according to the documents, that Elder Ballard maintained close contact with him during at least one disastrous overseas mission, which was based on information obtained by the psychic medium and aimed at rescuing a missing child. Ballard said the Mormon elder blessed him and his wife Katherine beforehand and received real-time updates from on the ground.” RELATED STORIES: Church officials are refuting claims of any kind of partnership between the two Ballards. They said the two men formed a friendship based on a shared interest of protecting children, but Elder Ballard cut ties when that friendship was “betrayed.” A spokesperson for the Church issued the following statement to Vice and KUTV: “President Ballard and Tim Ballard (no relation) established a friendship a number of years ago. That friendship was built on a shared interest in looking after God’s children wherever they are and without regard to their circumstance. However, that relationship is in the past. For many months, President Ballard has had no contact with the founder of Operation Underground Railroad (OUR). The nature of that relationship was always in support of vulnerable children being abused, trafficked, and otherwise neglected. Once it became clear Tim Ballard had betrayed their friendship, through the unauthorized use of President Ballard’s name for Tim Ballard’s personal advantage and activity regarded as morally unacceptable, President Ballard withdrew his association. President Ballard never authorized his name, or the name of the Church, to be used for Tim’s personal or financial interests. In addition, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints never endorsed, supported or represented OUR, Tim Ballard or any projects associated with them. President Ballard loves children, all over the world. It has been his mission and life’s work to look after them, care for them, and point them to their Savior.” The Church did publish an article in 2015, describing Tim Ballard and his efforts for OUR. In it, Ballard explained that his reasoning for founding OUR was his faith in Jesus Christ. Ballard was quoted as saying, “There’s no question in my mind that this is the Lord’s work and that we are His hands. This is so important because it’s so important to the Lord.” There is heavy speculation that Ballard is considering running for the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Mitt Romney at the end of his term. ---------------------'}]"

The photographs in this exhibit are the third in a trilogy of exhibitions he’s had at Gallery East over the period of about eight years. “For this third show I continue on my quest photographing the intermountain west,” he says. McAllister Explains: “These 30 photos explore visual tropes related to movement, thresholds, barriers, and symbolic encounters. They capture moments of joy and contemplation. Each photo works individually, but I have edited and arranged them in the gallery to create something between a narrative and a non-narrative that approximates the experience of what traveling to capture them was like, both on foot and in motion, in rural and in urban settings.” “The first show at Gallery East, Photographic Observations by A New Westerner (2015), was a warm up to the visual potential here in the west and established areas of interest and approaches to subject. The second show, Towns Less Occupied (2017), being a concentrated look at the built environment of small towns and as a canvas for exploration of ‘Hopperesque’ light and ridged composition.” The images in this exhibit were taken with less attention to formalities of set-up and careful composition. “These new photographs are from a series of road trips I took during Covid (2020-2022) where I wanted to see if I could photograph more ephemeral moments as experienced in contrast to my other formal approach to collecting,” he says. McAllister’s road trips were inspired by other photographers who had long photographing expeditions, living out of their vehicle, and being socially detached or distanced from people, as it was during the pandemic. “The first thing I saw out the window when I awoke, things on the side of the road, shadows, birds in flight. To contrast the trips, I did long walks looking at structures that seem permanent but are actually in transitional states. The house with the broken tree, the fading old mural, the question mark, glass reflections and more.” “The selecting of images was to create something that hinted at a narrative without being specific, as if I was remembering flickering moments of a long journey,” he explains. “Since the subject is more personal than a collecting or typology project I chose to print them at a smaller more intimate size.” The exhibit, Wanderer, will be on view through December 4. Students, faculty, staff and the public are invited. The gallery is located in the Central Instruction Building. A reception and artist’s talk will be held on Monday, December 4, from 6:00 – 8:00 PM. The gallery is free and open to the public during the academic year. Gallery East’s Fall 2023 hours are Monday through Friday 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM. Closed weekends, and holidays.
