Jason Purdy, 51, is in custody on multiple warrants from Labette County District Court. At 12:40 p.m. Thursday, Detective Brice Dickens and Sgt. Charles Brown were attempting to apprehend Purdy on the active arrest warrants after reports of him being at a particular residence in town. During their investigation, they learned that Purdy was at the Dollar Tree. Officers located Purdy inside the business. Purdy barricaded himself by locking himself inside a store restroom, prompting law enforcement to initiate a plan to apprehend him. Purdy initially stated that he was armed with a knife. The situation unfolded rapidly, with Cpl. Christian Smith and Officer Donald Joy securing the area and coordinating efforts to ensure the safety of bystanders and store employees. After a short negotiation and obtaining keys from the manager, officers apprehended Purdy without incident and without injury to Purdy, officers, or persons in the store.

Last year, the state saw $194 million in bets in February during the Super Bowl. The state earned just over $1,100 off the betting activity — a minuscule amount compared to the state’s $9 billion general fund budget. Compare that to the rest of the year — the state earns an average of $1 million a month in gambling taxes — and it's easy to see that the Chiefs victory crashed the state’s expected gambling revenue last year. That could again happen this year. But a Chiefs loss in the Super Bowl could reverse that trend. Cory Thone, a spokesperson for the Kansas Lottery, said the agency would have seen a pretty large spike in revenue if the Chiefs lost last year’s Super Bowl. “However, we all agreed that it was well worth it for the win,” Thone said in an email. “Go Chiefs!” Dylan Lysen reports on social services and criminal justice for the Kansas News Service.""}]"

The NetWork Kansas E-Community Partnership Loan total to date is CloudCorp loans, $258,000; and CloudCorp grants, $77,400. A community breakdown of loan/grants are: Concordia - three businesses for $135,000/$40,500; Clyde - two businesses for $60,000/$18,000; Miltonvale - one business for $18,000/$5,400; and Jamestown - one business for $45,000/$13,500. Reed also stated that CloudCorp's focus for the first quarter of 2024 includes finalizing details for CloudCorp Housing, LLC; finalizing the homebuyer application and FAQ to post on the website; the CloudCorp Annual Luncheon and Third Annual Youth Entrepreneurship Challenge; the EDP certification course in February; the annual stockholder meeting; the CDBG-CVR steps to qualify businesses for the funding; and establishing workforce recruitment targets. Deb Lange, the Broadway Plaza event coordinator and CloudCorp administrative assistant, reported to commissioners that there were 114 events at the plaza in 2023. In addition to scheduled events, there were private family reunions, and birthday, anniversary, and graduation parties. The Frank Carlson Library, Cloud County Community College, Concordia Unified School District 333, and local churches all used the plaza for activities and youth events. Lange also reported that the Plaza still needs to hire a maintenance man. There were issues with the activation button at the Splash Pad, and it also has a leak that will need to be fixed in the spring. The plaza received a $500 grant from Grain Belt Express and a $1,000 donation from Cloud County Tourism. The funds will be used for events for children at the plaza and repairs that will be needed for the splash pad. On the recommendation of Campbell & Johnson Engineers, P.A., commissioners rejected a proposed bid by Vogts-Parga Construction, LLC of $149,938.60 for the 20th Street Extension project. On February 1, 2024, bids were opened for the project. One bid was received from Vogts-Parga. The bid was three times the original engineer's estimate of $45,745, and approximately twice the current Engineer's Estimate. Shane Kisby of Aurora was introduced to commissioners as the city's new public works director. Kisby is a graduate of Clifton-Clyde High School and holds a degree in Natural Resource Management from Kansas State University. He has spent the past nine years working for Republican Valley Landscape. Kisby and his wife, Amber, currently reside in Aurora with their family.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 7:06 pm Joanie Phillips, Enterprise Public Library director, received a call this past fall from a private foundation in New York City. So did Shelly Wirtz, Herington Public Library director, and Jennifer McCall, Chapman Public Library director. The Brownstone Book Fund had chosen all three libraries to receive 100 children’s books. Two weeks ago, the books were delivered to the libraries. Wirtz and Phillips said the donations help their libraries financially in bringing a large number of new titles they wouldn’t normally be able to purchase. Phillips also said she can focus on buying more books for other age groups. “These are just kind of like a bonus, an extra choice, because we read out loud and kids read out loud for story time and sometimes you’d like just a different book that is kind of (new),” Phillips said. The books are meant for young children up to second grade to read, the directors said. Most of the books selected are either award winning, by new authors, or are classics. “So this (donation) is just for the children, so this frees me up to buy more adult books,” Phillips said. Wirtz said Herington Library has received 88 books so far, but she expected to receive the other 12 books in the future. Enterprise, Chapman and Herington were part of 12 libraries in the North Central Kansas Library System that received 100 books from the Brownstone Book Fund. The Brownstone Book Fund every year selects 100 libraries to receive 100 books for youth. “It’s one of those things for the community that really helps,” Phillips said. Log In Keep it Clean.

Especially… It is the subtlest of traps: to worship the path to God, instead of God. The Pharisees and Sadducees fell into this trap when Jesus showed them that God’s love… Sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) will soon be in a rapid vegetative growth stage. Sericea lespedeza continues to be a major concern on rangeland, pasture, and some CRP acres in Kansas…. It’s hard to believe the school year is coming to a close already! You know what that means? Another year of the Summer Lunch Program! We love providing sack lunches… School is out, and summer is almost here.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 6:24 pm The rescue of a child on Friday nearly 60 hours after a landslide hit a gold-mining village in the southern Philippines has been hailed as a ""miracle"" after searchers had given up hope of finding more survivors. The girl, who the Philippine Red Cross said was three years old, had been among scores of people missing after the rain-induced landslide hit the village. Officials said later on Friday the death toll had almost doubled to 27. The girl was earlier found as rescuers used their bare hands and shovels to look for survivors in Masara village on southern Mindanao island, disaster agency official Edward Macapili of Davao de Oro province told AFP. ""It\'s a miracle,"" Macapili said, adding that searchers had believed those missing were probably dead. ""That gives hope to the rescuers.

""We can see in the social media posts that the child did not have any visible injuries,"" Macapili said. He said the girl\'s father saw his child before she was taken to a medical facility for a check-up. The Philippine Red Cross posted photos on Facebook of their workers carrying the girl, wrapped in an emergency blanket and hooked up to an oxygen tank, into a hospital in nearby Mawab municipality. The landslide struck Tuesday night, destroying houses and engulfing three buses and a jeepney waiting to pick up workers from a gold mine. While the death toll increased to 27 from 15, the number of missing fell to 89 from more than 100, official figures showed, as searchers retrieved more bodies. The number of injured also rose to 32. Rescuers were racing to find anyone else alive in the thick mud as rain fell on Friday. While they were using heavy earth-moving equipment in places, they had to rely on their bare hands and shovels in areas where they believed there were bodies. Sniffer dogs were also used to detect those buried in the mud and rubble. Three buses and a jeepney buried by the landslide had been found ""at ground zero"", Apex Mining, the operator of the mine, said in a statement Friday.
