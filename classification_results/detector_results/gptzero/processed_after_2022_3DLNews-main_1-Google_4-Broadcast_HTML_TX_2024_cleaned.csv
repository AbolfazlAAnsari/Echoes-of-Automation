in Las Vegas, with the San Francisco 49ers taking on the Kansas City Chiefs in one of the biggest sporting events of the year. Here are the latest updates. 10:50 p.m. Eastern. The GOAT. The dynasty. Don’t count out Patrick Mahomes, who won his third Super Bowl title with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Mecole Harman in overtime. He is chasing Tom Brady’s seven championships, the current greatest of all time. Mahomes is in the conversation as well. This the Chiefs’ second Super Bowl championship in a row and third in five seasons. 49ers get OT field goal, one stop away from winning Super Bowl The Chiefs had chances to get the 49ers off the field in overtime, but a dropped interception and a defensive holding penalty on third down extended their drive. The Niners, though, blew their own opportunity by having to settle for a field goal in the red zone. 10:20 p.m. The first use of the NFL’s new overtime rule comes in the Super Bowl. No longer can the team that gets the ball first win it immediately with a touchdown. Both teams must posses the ball. Butker makes late field goal, forces OT Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker forced overtime with a 29-yard field goal with 3 seconds left to make the score 19-19. It’s familiar territory for Kyle Shanahan. The 49ers coach was part of the only other OT game in Super Bowl history when he was the Falcons’ offensive coordinator seven years ago. That was the 28-3 blown lead to the Patriots. Moody makes amends with go-ahead kick Jake Moody became the first kicker to make two 50-plus field goals in a Super Bowl –- and this one might be enough to give the 49ers the Super Bowl. His 53-yarder with 1:53 left gave San Francisco a 19-16 lead. Moody made up for a missed extra point. But Patrick Mahomes will get the ball. He’s shown what he can do in 13 seconds. Mahomes will have a lot more time now. Chiefs stall in red zone, settle for tying field goal in 4th Big stop for the 49ers. They kept the Chiefs out of the end zone even though they had first-and-goal at the 4, forcing a tying field goal with 5:46 left. Both teams have missed opportunities, so in that way, it’s kind of evened out. Now Brock Purdy can shed the quarterback-manager label or Patrick Mahomes will add to his extraordinary legacy. 9:45 p.m. Eastern 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan went for it. All Niners fans probably couldn’t believe it when he eschewed a field goal on fourth-and-3 early in the fourth quarter and converted it. San Francisco scored a touchdown to take a 16-13 lead. 16-13? The extra point was blocked, keeping the Chiefs within three. Could be huge. San Francisco’s Jauan Jennings joined Nick Foles as the only players to throw a touchdown pass and catch one in a Super Bowl. Foles did it six years ago for the Eagles against the Patriots. 9:30 p.m. Eastern One play after the 49ers had a punt bounce off one of their players and get recovered by Kansas City, Patrick Mahomes lofted a 16-yard pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling in the end zone to give the Chiefs a 13-10 lead in the Super Bowl. Valdes-Scantling was almost universally loathed by Chiefs fans for much of the season. He dropped several passes at crucial moments, including one that may have cost them a game. And considering he was the highest-paid wide receiver on a group that struggled all season, he became an easy target for failing to live up to his contract. But he had a big catch against Baltimore to help put away the AFC title game, and now has an even bigger one in the Super Bowl. San Francisco regretting missed chances The 49ers had their chances to put away the Chiefs. They might soon really regret it. A punt bounced off the Niners’ Darrell Luter’s leg, and Kansas City’s Jaylen Watson recovered at San Francisco’s 16. One play later, the Chiefs took their first lead of the game. You can’t hand any team, but especially a Super Bowl champion, those kinds of breaks. KC's defense locks down in third quarter Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce are the headliners, but the Chiefs are in the Super Bowl largely because of their defense. And did it show up in the third quarter. They forced three 49ers three-and-outs, holding San Francisco to 3 yards. Quarterback Brock Purdy is 4 for 12 for 17 yards since the start of the second quarter. Those game-management criticisms aren’t going away. One bit of good news for SF: Deebo Samuel is back after limping earlier with a hamstring issue. Chiefs make record 57-yard field goal, trail 49ers 10-6 Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker made a 57-yard field goal with 5:01 left in the third quarter, breaking a Super Bowl record from... two quarters ago. Jake Moody’s 55-yarder to open the scoring had been the longest in Super Bowl history, topping a 54-yarder by Buffalo’s Steve Christie. The kick came moments after a shirtless fan ran onto the field during a third-and-11. 9:20 p.m. Eastern 49ers receiver Deebo Samuel limped off the field early in the third quarter of the Super Bowl. San Francisco said it was a left hamstring injury and his return is questionable. The Niners’ do-everything receiver went down on a third-down pass on San Francisco’s second drive of the third quarter. Trainers came out to attend to him before walking off under his own power. He went briefly to the injury tent. The 49ers have struggled this season when Samuel has been hurt. They lost three straight games in October when he hurt his shoulder and struggled for most of a divisional round win against Green Bay after he hurt his other shoulder on the opening drive. 9:10 p.m. Eastern Well, there was Usher. And Alicia Keys. But not so much to see after halftime. The Super Bowl is the NFL’s premier event, but the 49ers and Chiefs are playing like it’s the second game of the preseason. Penalties, punts and turnovers. Not exactly what the league wanted for the first big game in Las Vegas. At least there were the multiple cutaways on the stadium screens to Taylor Swift. 8:15 p.m. The Chiefs are on the board with a 28-yard field goal from Harrison Butker with 20 seconds left before halftime. The 49ers have done a nice job on Travis Kelce so far — even in the red zone, where he and the Chiefs are often so effective. Kelce only has one catch for 1 yard on the day. On that last third down from the San Francisco 9, he lined up in the slot and was covered by safety Ji’Ayir Brown. Kelce appeared to swing an arm in frustration when Patrick Mahomes was taken down before being able to throw. 8:00 p.m. The San Francisco 49ers got tricky for the first touchdown of the Super Bowl. Coach Kyle Shanahan dialed up a rare trick play that led to a TD pass from receiver Jauan Jennings to running back Christian McCaffrey. Brock Purdy started the play with a lateral to the left side to Jennings, who immediately threw it back to the other side to McCaffrey, who had a convoy of blockers and ran in for a 21-yard TD to put San Francisco up 10-0. McCaffrey has tied an NFL record with his seventh straight playoff game with at least 50 yards from scrimmage and a TD. San Francisco has moved to a 7 1/2-point favorite on FanDuel’s live line after the spread was a good bit closer at the start of the game. Taylor Swift chugs a drink, draws big applause There has been plenty of Taylor Swift on the big screens of Allegiant Stadium, and during the last timeout, cameras caught her in a race to chug what appeared to be a beer in her suite. Swift was the first to finish, and she triumphantly slammed the cup down as the video cut away to other fans. But not before an appreciative roar rippled through the stadium. If only the Chiefs were able to move the ball as successfully as she downed her drink. Their offense has gone nowhere in the first half of their Super Bowl showdown with the 49ers. ‘Bennifer’ is back for Super Bowl ad “Bennifer” has teamed up with Dunkin for a second Super Bowl in a row.

The child was in critical condition after being taken to a hospital. The man who was wounded in his hip was stable. Finner said that after the woman began shooting, both officers ""engaged"" and the woman was killed.

— The shooting at Houston’s Lakewood Church over the weekend was a “completely preventable horror” as the woman who opened fire had a notable mental illness but was still allowed to own a gun, her mother-in-law said. “My daughter-in-law when she was taking medication for schizophrenia was a very sweet and loving woman,” Walli Carranza, the mother-in-law of 36-year-old Genesse Ivonne Moreno wrote in a Facebook post Monday. “But mental illness is real illness and when family members seek emergency protections they’re not doing so for their own sake but for the sake of the person who is ill.” Investigators are still trying to determine why Moreno opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle in the popular megachurch Sunday. Two people were injured, including Moreno’s 7-year-old son, before Moreno was killed by law enforcement. Moreno had been put under an order for emotional detention in 2016. She had a mental health history documented by Houston police, said Christopher Hassig, commander of the Houston Police Department’s homicide division. Carranza, the shooter’s mother-in-law, had unsuccessfully petitioned to be declared conservator of Moreno’s son Sam in 2022. She said Sam was wounded in the head when off-duty officers shot and killed Moreno at the church. Moreno should never have been allowed to own firearms, her mother-in-law said. Texas has no red flag law – also known as an extreme risk protection order law – that would allow authorities to take weapons from a person thought to be in crisis. “The fault lies in a child protective services of Montgomery County and Harris County that refused to remove custody from a woman with known mental illness that was not being treated and with the state of Texas for not having strong red flag laws that would have prevented her from owning or possessing a gun,” Carranza wrote. “Child Protective Services is investigating the shooting at Lakewood Church alongside law enforcement. At this time, DFPS cannot provide additional information because specific details of investigations are confidential according to law,” said Melissa Lanford, a spokesperson for the state Department of Family and Protective Services. In an interview with CNN affiliate KHOU, Carranza said that she feared Moreno might be the shooter the moment she heard the news. “She had a particular kind of schizophrenia that caused her to become violent,” Carranza said. “She threatened her husband, my own son, and we still couldn’t get intervention.” How the shooting unfolded The shooter confronted a security guard Sunday outside the Lakewood Church, where well-known televangelist and pastor Joel Osteen preaches, shortly before 2 p.m. Investigators believe she may have revealed a weapon to the guard, who was unarmed, and forced her way in, according to Houston Police Chief Troy Finner. Wearing a trench coat and backpack, she entered the converted sports arena between church services and opened fire in a hallway with an AR-platform rifle, Hassig said. One federal law enforcement source told CNN she fired around 30 bullets. Two off-duty officers were at the church: a 28-year-old Houston Police Department officer and a 38-year-old agent with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, both with less than five years of service. The two officers engaged the shooter and she was fatally hit, the police chief said. Moreno’s son, who was shot in the head during the ordeal, is in critical condition at a hospital, Finner said. It’s unclear who fired the shot that wounded the child and CNN has reached out to police for more information. A 57-year-old man who was also shot in the leg has been released from a medical facility, Finner said. It remains unclear what led up to the shooting and what motivated Moreno, who has a lengthy criminal history and had been going through a bitter divorce. Investigators have said they are attempting to unravel whether the incident was politically motivated or carried out by a mentally disturbed individual, according to a federal law enforcement source. “We’re in the infancy stages of this” investigation, Special Agent in Charge Douglas Williams of the FBI’s Houston office said Monday. But as far as the motive and how the shooter got her weapon, “We’re not there yet.” The shooting at a place of worship is just another example of gun violence upending American life at places once considered safe. Other targets have included schools, grocery stores, outlet malls, hospitals, college campuses and house parties. Police say shooter had history of mental health issues and had antisemitic writings Hours after the shooting, authorities searched Moreno’s home in Conroe – about 50 miles north of Lakewood Church, the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Monday. According to a search warrant obtained by CNN, investigators said the shooter claimed at the scene to have a bomb but had yellow rope similar to a detonation cord and “substances consistent with the manufacture of explosive devices.” CNN has reached out to the Houston Fire Department for further information. The shooter used an AR-15 with a “Palestine” sticker on it during the attack, which she legally purchased in December, police said. She also had a .22 caliber weapon in her bag that was not used, according to a federal law enforcement source. Carranza, Moreno’s mother-in-law, is a rabbi. Despite the shooter’s past antisemitic writings, Carranza wrote that she doesn’t believe Moreno was motivated by hate. “Although my former daughter-in-law raged against Israel and Jews in a pro-Palestinian rant yesterday this has nothing to do with Judaism or Islam,” Carranza wrote on Facebook Monday. Authorities have a lot of work to do before any motive is clear, CNN law enforcement analyst John Miller said Monday. “That’s why federal authorities were executing search warrants,” he said. They’re “looking for computers, any written documents, thumb drives, social media, online. They’re really peeling back through the identity of this person.” Information from Moreno’s social media accounts and local authorities paints a portrait of a single mother with a history of mental health challenges grappling with the ups and downs of trying to turn her life around and launch a business. Hassig said the shooter used multiple aliases, including both male and female names. Records from the Texas Department of Public Safety show Moreno had a string of arrests for minor offenses over the last two decades, including illegal possession of a weapon. But in her 30s, she described herself on social media as the founder of a real-estate and financial services firm. By her own account on social media pages, she is involved in sales of everything from new condos to shopping malls. A social media post in March 2020 shows a screenshot of a form letter from Lakewood Church thanking Moreno for her donation. The police chief was asked Monday whether the shooter had a connection to the church and he said it was under investigation. A CNN review showed the story of a bitter custody battle between Moreno and representatives for her ex-spouse’s family played out on her social media accounts. In 2022, when she had her divorce proceeding transferred to county court, according to an attorney who represented her, Moreno was also arrested on a weapons charge, a misdemeanor, which was cleared with two days’ time served in the Fort Bend County Jail. According to police, there was some sort of family dispute between the shooter and her ex-husband and ex-husband’s family, some of whom are Jewish. “This might possibly be where all this stems from,” Hassig added. He said police also found antisemitic writings connected with the shooter. Attorney William Capasso said he represented Moreno in 2021-2022 and told CNN that Moreno went by the name Jeffrey Moreno Carranza at the time. Capasso said he later withdrew as her attorney and she represented herself in divorce proceedings. The shooter’s complicated history adds to the uncertainty around establishing a motive and has created a “conundrum” for authorities determining whether this shooting was done out of hate or a mental-health crisis, Miller said.

George Santos’s (R-N.Y.) House seat, a race that could have broader implications for November as the party hopes to flip the lower chamber. Although Democrats see the seat as a prime pickup opportunity, recent polls have shown their nominee, former Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.), locked in a tight race with Republican Mazi Pilip, who has sought to tie him to President Biden’s policies, especially on immigration. With New York viewed as key to Democrats’ chances of winning the House, the race is an important bellwether for both parties. And a Democratic loss would raise alarm bells for a party grappling with an incumbent president dogged by low approval ratings and growing concerns over immigration. “Both sides will say this is a must-win election, but the stakes are higher for Democrats. Suozzi’s high name recognition, combined with the fact that he’s leading in nearly every major poll, sets an expectation that Democrats will regain control of this seat,” Democratic strategist Greg Drilling said. “If Pilip pulls off a victory, it will be seen as a major upset that generates momentum for Republicans heading into November.” Republicans scored an upset victory in the district in 2022 when Santos won by more than 7 points. The district under its current borders would have voted for Biden over former President Trump by 8 points in the 2020 presidential election. In the aftermath of Santos being expelled from the House in December following the House Ethics Investigation into the many false statements he made about his background, Democrats seemed poised for a chance to further narrow the GOP’s already-narrow majority in the body. The party turned to Suozzi, who previously represented the district for six years before not seeking reelection in 2022 to pursue an unsuccessful gubernatorial bid, as their nominee. Democrats have described Suozzi as a familiar face for New York’s 3rd Congressional District who has developed a reputation as a moderate well-suited to represent the district’s constituents. He is facing an opponent who at least started the campaign as a relatively unknown candidate who served in the Nassau County Legislature. Suozzi and the Democrats have also comfortably outspent Pilip and the Republicans throughout the race. But the handful of polls conducted on the race have shown a tight match-up with Suozzi in the lead, though within the margin of error. Beneath the surface, some reasons for concern linger for Democrats. Long Island, where the district is located, has more commonly been electing Republicans in recent years. Nassau County, which makes up most of the district, has leaned Democratic at the presidential level but is led by a Republican county executive, and a majority of the members of the county legislature are Republican. The congressional district comfortably voted for former GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin in the state’s 2022 gubernatorial race. Pilip’s campaign has centered its attacks on Suozzi around immigration, an apparent effort to tie him to Biden, whose policies on the issue have been rated poorly. Voters in the district say immigration is one of their most important issues. Democrats still expressed optimism about Suozzi winning but recognized the race likely will be tight given the realities of the district. “Tom Suozzi’s moderate politics and nearly three decades of public service in Nassau County makes him one of the few Democrats in New York capable of winning that district at this moment,” Drilling said. “NY-3 is a swing district that both parties see as winnable, so operatives across the country are closely watching to see what messaging and tactics ultimately resonate with voters.” He said the strategies the winning campaign uses will likely be adopted in other competitive swing districts this year. Democratic strategist Gabe Tobias said the election is the first “real race” of 2024 and a bellwether of Democratic chances throughout the year. He said Democrats should win, especially in the aftermath of the “fiasco” surrounding Santos, but Suozzi’s lead in the polls by a few points is “not anywhere near a sure thing.” Tobias argued Democrats need to work to mobilize their voters to succeed in congressional races this year, focusing on issues like protecting abortion access and democracy in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade overturning and the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Suozzi has sought to push back against Pilip’s accusations that he is weak on securing the border, releasing ads calling attention to his support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and emphasizing his support for the bipartisan Senate legislation on immigration that Senate Republicans ultimately blocked. Tobias, who served as a senior adviser to the progressive PAC Justice Democrats, argued Republicans are trying to set immigration as the defining issue of the race, but Democrats should not buy into that. “What that does is just lifting up those right-wing talking points and making it seem like they’re representing reality instead of talking about things that they should be talking about, which is the threat posed to the fundamental nature of our democracy by the far-right,” he said. “That’s what voters need to be hearing right now. That’s I would say more than anything how Democrats were able to win such surprising victories in 2022.” One Democratic strategist disagreed, arguing that doubling down on immigration not being a serious issue would cause a worse performance. They said Suozzi is pursuing the right strategy in navigating a difficult position on immigration, but if he loses, it’ll be because national narratives are dominating the race. “If Suozzi loses, Democrats should be very concerned about November. A Suozzi defeat means that Republicans may have found their winning formula for swing districts in November: Tie the Democrat to President Biden and the border crisis,” they said. Democratic strategist Tom Bonier said Suozzi needs to simultaneously improve Democratic turnout and persuade more independents than the party did in 2022 when Santos won. He said the signs appear promising for Suozzi so far based on an analysis of early voting and polls, but most people vote on election day. He added that immigration and abortion likely will be the two issues most impacting voters’ decisions. Democrats have sought to tie Pilip to Republican calls for a national abortion ban, despite Pilip having said she is opposed to abortion but would not support a ban. A Siena College poll found voters trust Suozzi significantly more than Pilip on addressing abortion, while Pilip performed strongest of several key issues with addressing the influx of migrants into the country. But Bonier said Democrats may not be in as poor of a position on immigration in the aftermath of Republicans’ “failure” on the issue in Congress. After negotiators from both parties reached a deal to address the migrants entering the U.S., the legislation failed to advance in the Senate this week after Trump called on members of his party to oppose it. Suozzi supported the bill, while Pilip opposed it. “If nothing else, it’s likely blunted the effectiveness of the issue. For me, this will be an interesting but a very early test of have Republicans lost what they, I believe, had hoped to be their most powerful issue in this election,” Bonier said, referring to both the special election and the 2024 campaign. He was less concerned about the meaning of Suozzi falling short in the race by a few points as long as he improves the Democrats’ margin compared to 2022. He said if Suozzi loses by 8 points, which seems unlikely, that would be a “red flag” for the party, but demographics have caused the district to trend away from Democrats. If Suozzi wins, Bonier said, it would be a “good sign” that Democrats are equipped with the right strategy for success in 2024. New York’s 3rd District is one of five House seats in the state Republicans currently hold that Democrats see as key to their strategy to win back the majority. “To take a seat that was blue in 2020, flipped red … in 2022, to bring it back in is certainly a good sign for Democrats both in terms of ability to take back the House in November but also in terms of the presidential race to the extent that the Democratic playbook is to run against Republican extremism,” Bonier said.

(AP) — President Joe Biden’s personal attorney said Sunday he went to both the special counsel and the attorney general to register concerns over what he viewed to be pejorative and unnecessary digs at the president’s memory. “This is a report that went off the rails,” Bob Bauer said on CBS’ Face the Nation Sunday. “It’s a shabby work product.” The special counsel was investigating whether the president mishandled classified documents during his previous positions as vice president and senator, and found this week that no criminal charges were warranted. But in building his argument for why no charges were necessary, Special Counsel Robert Hur, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, detailed in part that Biden’s defense of any potential charges could possibly be that: “Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” And then he went on to cite examples where investigators said the president’s memory lapsed, including over when his older son Beau had died. In particular, the comments about Beau Biden enraged the president, who has been very open about his grief over his son’s death, speaking often of him. “How the hell dare he raise that,” Biden questioned angrily following the report’s release. “Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, was it any of their damn business?” Biden’s age has already been a concern for voters. Democrats are now answering the widespread questions about the 81-year-old president’s age and readiness by affirming that Biden is capable of being commander in chief and trying to discredit people who portray him feeble.

But the appeal failed. “It’s evident that he had committed to make the report public the way that the special counsel had written it,” said Bauer. Former Trump Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein defended the report on CNN’ “State of the Union” Sunday. “When you conduct a criminal investigation, some of the information that you uncover and some things that you evaluate don’t necessarily put the subject in a favorable light. And, ordinarily, that’s not publicized.

something to do with him. DeCosta lives almost 4,000 miles from Kansas City, but he\'s a major Chiefs fan and the Chiefs nurse a long and bitter rivalry against the Las Vegas Raiders. Late in 2017, his company assigned him to work on a new stadium the hated Raiders were building in Las Vegas. ""As soon as I got the opportunity, I knew what I had planned already,"" DeCosta recalls. The plan: Bury a ""Chiefs Kingdom"" flag under the rival team\'s home field. Plant a curse in enemy territory. A tweet went up picturing DeCosta in his white hardhat, standing at the construction site, holding the cheerful red and gold banner. The tweet said the flag was now encased in concrete under the middle of the playing field. All hell broke loose. ""When this first happened, I get the phone call from the president of the Raiders. He\'s like, \'Did you see what\'s going on, you know, social media? Did they really plant this flag at the stadium?\'"" remembers Tommy White, the business manager and secretary treasurer of Laborers Union Local 872 in Las Vegas. White tried to reassure Raiders owner Mark Davis that such a thing was impossible. Then he set about identifying and confronting this Chiefs flag troublemaker who was digging around where he wasn\'t supposed to. ""I tracked him down, and I was like, \'Gerard, did you really dig this flag up?\' And he is like, \'I\'m not gonna say I did, or I didn\'t.\' I was like, \'Listen, it\'s important because they\'re gonna can you from the site.\'"" White demanded the offending flag. DeCosta produced a flag just like the one in the photo. (Similar flags currently sell for about $14 on eBay, so it\'s not as if they\'re in short supply.) But DeCosta is cagy about what he did with The Flag. When pressed, he says he\'s ""pleading the Fifth."" Nevertheless, the Raiders have never beaten the Chiefs at home since Allegiant Stadiumopened in 2020. So, if there is curse, it\'s working, and as far as a lot of Boston and Chicago fans are concerned, it wouldn\'t be the first time. For Boston, there was theCurse of the Bambino. Babe Ruth dropped it on the Red Sox when the baseball team made a deal with the Yankees sending him to New York in 1920. The Red Sox had been one of the winningest teams in baseball but it was 86 years before they could celebrate another national championship. The Chicago Cubs suffered the Curse of the Billy Goat in 1945. A tavern owner was kicked out of Wrigley Field for bringing his smelly goat into a World Series game. ""Them Cubs, they ain\'t gonna win no more,"" he shouted on his way out. The Cubs blew a two-game lead and lost the series. When they did finally win the World Series in 2016, that ended a 108 year drought. White is certain Allegiant Stadium is curse free, though he understands why so many people yearn for magic from under the sod. ""Everybody wants to believe in a conspiracy theory, right? I would love to turn around and say that, um, uh, the Raiders should have won some of those games. I mean, they come on, they lost four games in their home stadium, right? Against the Chiefs. But at the end of the day, the Chiefs had a better team,"" he says. White says the Chiefs can\'t count on any special good luck in the big game. In fact, he says if there are any little planted curses active in Allegiant Stadium on Sunday, they\'ll probably be working against the Chiefs. After all, Kansas City will be using the Raiders\' locker room and the Raiders\' field as they try to beat the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl 58. Copyright 2024 NPR.

It\'s an ""emergent bladder issue,"" according to officials. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was hospitalized again at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the Pentagon announced Sunday, and that his duties had been transferred to Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks. He was taken to the hospital early in the afternoon for symptoms suggesting an ""emergent bladder issue,"" the Pentagon’s statement said. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin speaks during a virtual Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) meeting at the Pentagon on November 22, 2023 in Arlington, Virginia. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Austin was hospitalized last month and made headlines for failing to quickly notify the president and other senior leaders. His hospitalization was following a prostate cancer diagnosis in early December, which had not been made known. He had a procedure called a prostatectomy on Dec. 22 and was hospitalized on January 1, when he began suffering complications from the procedure. His hospitalization was not made known until five days later, and he remained at the hospital until Jan. 15. RELATED: White House, Pentagon reviewing defense secretary\'s secretive hospital stay That secrecy has become the subject of an inspector general investigation and a Pentagon internal review. He has previously said he never instructed his staff to keep his hospitalization a secret. Meanwhile, his doctors have previously said his prognosis against the cancer is ""excellent"" and that no further treatments will be needed. Austin was scheduled to depart Tuesday for Brussels to hold a meeting of the Ukraine contact group, which he established in 2022 to coordinate military support for Kyiv after Russia\'s invasion. After that, Austin was scheduled to attend a regular meeting of NATO defense ministers. It was not immediately clear if his hospitalization would change those plans.

According to the FAA, there are also about 2,000 openings for air traffic controllers. Training programs at the college level could also expand. Whitaker also met with airline leaders to talk about safety trends.

It seems like people don\'t realize the sickies are going around like crazy. Be sure to remind your friends and family of the importance of frequent hand washing, especially your little ones. Here\'s your sign to bust out the Lysol and hand sanitizer in your Texas classrooms if you haven\'t already, and practice a little social distancing if you\'re able. It doesn\'t hurt to try to get ahead of the problem. If you\'ve been coughing lately, you might consider digging one of your masks out from the pandemic and wearing it. Stay healthy, friends!

And will the U.S. make sure that UNRWA doesn\'t run out of money? Thomas-Greenfield: Look, the U.S. has always been a strong supporter of humanitarian programs that are facilitated by UNRWA.

So for that reason, we paused our assistance. But we are continuing to work with the U.N. in their effort to investigate.

(AP) — President Joe Biden’s personal attorney said Sunday he went to both the special counsel and the attorney general to register concerns over what he viewed to be pejorative and unnecessary digs at the president’s memory. “This is a report that went off the rails,” Bob Bauer said on CBS’ Face the Nation Sunday. “It’s a shabby work product.” The special counsel was investigating whether the president mishandled classified documents during his previous positions as vice president and senator, and found this week that no criminal charges were warranted. But in building his argument for why no charges were necessary, Special Counsel Robert Hur, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, detailed in part that Biden’s defense of any potential charges could possibly be that: “Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” And then he went on to cite examples where investigators said the president’s memory lapsed, including over when his older son Beau had died. In particular, the comments about Beau Biden enraged the president, who has been very open about his grief over his son’s death, speaking often of him. “How the hell dare he raise that,” Biden questioned angrily following the report’s release. “Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, was it any of their damn business?” Biden’s age has already been a concern for voters. Democrats are now answering the widespread questions about the 81-year-old president’s age and readiness by affirming that Biden is capable of being commander in chief and trying to discredit people who portray him feeble. First lady Jill Biden wrote a letter to donors Saturday questioning whether those comments were politically motivated; it fetched the most money in donations of any email since Biden launched his campaign. Bauer, who is married to Biden’s top White House aide Anita Dunn, said he raised concerns over the inclusion of these details to both Hur and Garland, which he viewed to be a violation of the Justice Department norms that essentially work to avoid prejudicing the public against people who are not charged with a crime. But the appeal failed. “It’s evident that he had committed to make the report public the way that the special counsel had written it,” said Bauer. Former Trump Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein defended the report on CNN’ “State of the Union” Sunday. “When you conduct a criminal investigation, some of the information that you uncover and some things that you evaluate don’t necessarily put the subject in a favorable light. And, ordinarily, that’s not publicized. And I think that’s a good thing,” he said. “It’s unfortunate that the special counsel process results in public reports that expose things that otherwise would remain sealed in Department of Justice files.” The president sat down with investigators over several hours just as the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas happened. He said he answered the questions truthfully and to the best of his knowledge. Bauer argued that what didn’t make it into the report were moments when the president deconstructed questions by investigators and when the special counsel notes that he’d be taking Biden through “events that are many years ago,” and notes that he should just give his best recollection. He said the special counsel made a decision “to cherry pick in a very misleading way” what references made it in and what didn’t. Bauer, too, suggested there was political pressure on the Justice Department, which is prosecuting former President Donald Trump for refusing to turn over a trove of classified documents as well as his role in the Jan. 6 violence at the U.S. Capitol and has been excoriated by Trump and others as biased and that his prosecution represents a “two-tiered system of justice.” Hur is a Republican, and a former U.S. attorney under Trump. “So you have to wonder with those pressures impinging on the investigation from the outside knowing the attacks that Republicans have levied on the law enforcement process, did he decide we would have to ask that we reach the only legal conclusion possible and then toss in the rest of it to placate a certain political constituency?” Bauer asked. The Justice Department has not commented on the criticism. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

election year, but not for Republicans, who are most concerned with immigration, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist pollfinds. For Democrats, they said preserving democracy is top of mind for them when thinking about voting in this November\'s election, followed by inflation. For independents, it was preserving democracy, followed by immigration and inflation. After immigration for Republicans, it was inflation, and nothing else came close. The results explain the evident divide when it comes to what the candidates are campaigning on. Former President Donald Trump routinely talks about the threat from immigration, often in nativist and xenophobic ways. Immigration was fundamental to his initial political rise in 2015, and there\'s a clear split in the survey on Americans\' mentality toward it. A majority said the country\'s openness to people from all over the world is essential to what it means to be American. But nearly three-quarters of Republicans said being too open risks America\'s identity. Loading... President Biden and Democrats see Trump as that very threat to democracy given his increasingly pro-authoritarian rhetoric on the campaign trail. That follows the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol carried by Trump supporters after Trump tried to remain in office by spreading lies about the American voting system. But nine months from Election Day — and with the GOP primary continuing — both men, if they are the nominees, face challenges. Biden is not well-liked and is struggling to reassemble his winning coalition from 2020. He\'s lagging with independents, younger voters and nonwhites. And he\'s facing a skeptical electorate when it comes to his handling of the economy and immigration — in addition to persistent concerns about his age. Trump, who is not much younger, is also contending with the fact that most Americans continue to say they don\'t like him very much, either. He struggles particularly with women and suburban voters — and both groups would vote more heavily for Biden if Trump is convicted of a crime, the survey found. If Trump is convicted as a result of the dozens of charges against him, Biden goes from a 1-point lead in the poll — a statistical tie — to a wider 6-point lead. Contributing to that are 9-point swings in Biden\'s favor with both women and suburban voters, as well as a 6-point decline for Trump with independents and a 5-point drop with Republicans. As a panel of federal judges unanimously decided Tuesday, two-thirds of respondents don\'t think Trump should have immunity from criminal prosecution for things he did as president — and almost half of respondents continue to say they already think he has done something illegal. Three-quarters said he has at least done something wrong. Loading... At the same time, more than two-thirds of Republicans said Trump should have immunity from criminal prosecution. Despite Trump\'s vulnerabilities, 93% of Republicans said they would vote for Trump over Biden, as opposed to just 78% who said they would vote for former Trump U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley over Biden (15% said they\'re unsure or don\'t know how they would vote). Because Republicans who otherwise support Trump withheld support for Haley in the survey, Haley is in a statistical tie — just like Trump. Plus, more Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they were concerned that Haley is ""too extreme"" to win in a general election than those who said they were concerned about Trump being too extreme. Haley has made her electability against Biden a principal argument in her case against Trump, but Republicans aren\'t buying it. It just shows the stronghold Trump has on GOP voters. If Republicans were fully with her in the survey — as they likely would be if she won the primary — she\'d certainly be leading Biden in this theoretical match-up, because she significantly cuts into Biden\'s lead with suburban voters and wins independents by double-digits. Trump could have real problems in a general election, as general-election voters view him very differently than Republicans alone. But Biden\'s not in a great position, either. His job approval remains low (40%) as does his handling of the economy (41%) and, especially, immigration. Only 29% of respondents said they approve of how Biden is handling immigration, and Republicans hold a 12-point advantage on the question of which party Americans think would do a better job when it comes to dealing with the issue. It\'s not too surprising then to see why some Republicans, especially Trump, aren\'t willing to go along with a congressional border deal that was negotiated by a bipartisan group of lawmakers. ""Let me tell you, I\'m not willing to do too damn much right now to help a Democrat and to help Joe Biden\'s approval rating,"" Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, told CNN last month. ""I will not help the Democrats try to improve this man\'s dismal approval ratings. I\'m not going to do it. Why would I?"" When Trump came out against it, you might say he built a border wall of GOP opposition. As far as what respondents think should be the top immigration priority, they said they want border security increased (41%), followed by allowing immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children (also known as DREAMers) to have a path to legalization (28%), taking in refugees trying to escape war and violence (15%) and increasing deportations of immigrants in the country illegally (14%). Republican respondents overwhelmingly said the top priority should be border security (60%) followed by increasing deportations (22%). But the plurality of Democrats think giving DREAMers a path to legalization should be top (44%), followed by taking in refugees (25%). Biden is underperforming with lots of key groups. He won independents in 2020, according to exit polls, but loses them in this survey by 8 points to Trump. Biden won women by 15 points in 2020, but only leads by 4 with them in this poll. Plus, just 57% of Black voters, 38% of Latinos and only 30% of those 18 to 29 approve of the job he\'s doing, the lowest of any age bracket. In 2020, Biden won almost 9 in 10 Black voters, two-thirds of Latinos and roughly 60% of young voters. When it comes to his handling of immigration, Latinos give Biden an abysmal 27% approval. To be clear, whether respondents say they approve of Biden\'s handling of a given issue is not necessarily an indication of how they would vote in the end. But the numbers do give signals about where Biden is most vulnerable. Suburban voters are buoying Biden, as he leads Trump by 16 points with them. Trump has been and continues to be toxic with the group. Despite younger voters disapproving of the job Biden is doing by big margins, Gen Z/Millennials provide Biden with the largest lead of the generational groups against Trump — 7 points. Biden also continues to perform well with older voters. He\'s up 6 with the Silent/Greatest Generation and up 2 with Baby Boomers. Those results are notable, because older voters have traditionally been strong GOP voters. Trump won those 65 and older by 5 points in 2020. The survey of 1,582 adults and 1,441 registered voters was conducted from Jan. 29 through Feb. 1 by the Marist Poll via cell phone and landline using live interviewers, by text and online and in both English and Spanish. When all adults are mentioned, the survey has a margin of error of +/- 3.4 percentage points. When voters are mentioned, results have a margin of error of +/- 3.6 percentage points. There are also 601 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents included in the survey. Results noting these groups specifically have a +/- 5.5 percentage-point margin of error.

'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video LAS VEGAS — Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Andy Reid have made the Kansas City Chiefs a dynasty. They’re already thinking three-peat. First, they had to become the first back-to-back Super Bowl champions in 19 years. Mahomes made sure of it, leading another super comeback on the NFL’s biggest stage in America’s showcase capital. Mahomes threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman in overtime, and the Chiefs rallied to beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 on Sunday, becoming the NFL\'s ninth repeat Super Bowl champs. With pop star Taylor Swift watching boyfriend Kelce from a suite, the Chiefs captured their third title in five years, a run that puts them among the league\'s greatest franchises. “Well, you know the goal has always been to get three,” Kelce screamed on stage after sharing a kiss with Swift. “But we couldn’t get here without getting that two, and having that target on our back all year. ... How about that. We get a chance to do it three times in a row.” The NFL’s first Super Bowl in Las Vegas was a sloppy, mistake-filled affair that was mostly boring until the back-and-forth fourth quarter and OT. It was the second of 58 Super Bowls to be tied after regulation, and the first played under new overtime rules that ensured both teams got the ball. The Chiefs (15-6) trailed 22-19 after Jake Moody kicked a 27-yard field goal on the first possession of overtime, but Mahomes rallied the Chiefs, completing another impressive comeback in a rematch of the Super Bowl four years ago. Mahomes ran 8 yards on fourth-and-1 to keep the Chiefs\' chances alive and then scrambled 19 yards to set up the winning score, which came 14:57 into the extra period — just before what would have been the second OT. “With all the adversity we’ve been through this season to come through tonight. ... I’m proud of the guys,” said Mahomes, who earned his third Super Bowl MVP award. “This is awesome. Legendary.” After he connected with a wide-open Hardman, the Chiefs ran on the field as red-and-yellow confetti fell onto the turf. Mahomes and Reid are now halfway to Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, who won six championships in 20 years together with the New England Patriots and were the most recent team to go back-to-back following the 2003-04 seasons. The 28-year-old Mahomes becomes the fourth starting QB to win three Super Bowls — joining Brady, Joe Montana, Terry Bradshaw and Troy Aikman — and second-youngest. “I am going to celebrate tonight, celebrate at the parade and then work my way to get back in this game next year,” Mahomes said. “I am going to do whatever I can to be back in this game next year. Three-peat.” The most excitement in the first half came when a frustrated Kelce bumped Reid on the sideline, knocking the Chiefs\' 65-year-old coach a few steps back after teammate Isiah Pacheco fumbled inside the red zone during the second quarter. “You guys saw that?” Kelce said. “I’m going to keep it between us unless my ‘mic’d up’ tells the world. I was just telling him how much I loved him.” The action picked up after a crucial blunder by San Francisco’s special teams set up Mahomes’ 16-yard TD pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling for a 13-10 lead. Brock Purdy and the 49ers (14-6) answered but they couldn’t make enough plays, denying Mr. Irrelevant an opportunity to go from last pick in the 2022 NFL draft to Super Bowl champion. “We have the offense to score touchdowns and I failed to put the team in position to do that,"" Purdy said. Niners wide receiver Jauan Jennings threw a TD pass and caught one, joining Eagles quarterback Nick Foles six years ago as the only players to do both in the Super Bowl. After Moody’s 53-yard field goal gave the Niners a 19-16 lead with 1:53 remaining, Mahomes and Kelce went to work. Mahomes connected with Kelce for a 22-yard gain to set up Harrison Butker’s tying kick, a 29-yarder with 3 seconds left. A holding call on Kansas City’s Trent McDuffie extended San Francisco’s opening drive of overtime and Purdy made key throws to drive the 49ers to the Chiefs 9. But San Francisco settled for a field goal. Purdy, Christian McCaffrey and the Niners jumped ahead 10-0, but that’s no big deal for Mahomes and the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. They’ve trailed by 10 points in all three of their victories, including last year’s 38-35 win over Philadelphia. Mahomes wasn’t at his best early and threw an interception. But with the game on the line, he was a magician once again. He finished 34 of 46 for 333 yards and two TDs. The Chiefs were hardly dominant during the regular season and entered the playoffs as the AFC\'s No. 3 seed. They won at Buffalo and at Baltimore in the postseason — the first road playoff games of Mahomes\' career — and entered the Super Bowl as 2 1/2-point underdogs, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. “The Kansas City Chiefs are never underdogs. Just know that,” Mahomes said. They became the first team to win consecutive Super Bowls as underdogs; the Philadelphia Eagles were slight favorites a year ago. The game turned when San Francisco’s Ray-Ray McCloud couldn’t scoop a punt that hit teammate Darrell Luter Jr.’s leg and the Chiefs recovered at the 49ers 16, leading to Mahomes\' go-ahead TD pass to Valdes-Scantling. The Niners answered on the next possession with Purdy tossing a 10-yard TD pass to Jennings for a 16-13 lead. Moody’s extra point was blocked. Niners coach Kyle Shanahan gambled on fourth-and-3 from the Chiefs 15, passing up a chance for a tying field goal. Purdy hit George Kittle for a 4-yard gain and then found Jennings for the score. Shanahan resorted to trickery for the only touchdown of the first half. Jennings, a wide receiver who had never thrown a pass in an NFL game, tossed a 21-yard TD to McCaffrey. He was hit as he threw a wobbly pass across the field, but McCaffrey snagged it and sprinted to the end zone. Shanahan fell to 0-2 as a head coach in Super Bowls and 0-3 overall, including a loss when he was offensive coordinator for Atlanta. That was the game in which Brady and the Patriots rallied from a 28-3 deficit to win in OT. “When you go against guys like Tom Brady and Pat Mahomes, you never feel comfortable with a lead. Those guys are two of the best to ever play the game,” Shanahan said. There were plenty of stars in the building as the NFL brought its biggest game to this gambling mecca — once a taboo idea.

for this video Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video LAS VEGAS — Super Bowl 58 has kicked off off in Las Vegas, with the San Francisco 49ers taking on the Kansas City Chiefs in one of the biggest sporting events of the year. Here are the latest updates. 10:50 p.m. Eastern. The GOAT. The dynasty. Don’t count out Patrick Mahomes, who won his third Super Bowl title with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Mecole Harman in overtime. He is chasing Tom Brady’s seven championships, the current greatest of all time. Mahomes is in the conversation as well. This the Chiefs’ second Super Bowl championship in a row and third in five seasons. 49ers get OT field goal, one stop away from winning Super Bowl The Chiefs had chances to get the 49ers off the field in overtime, but a dropped interception and a defensive holding penalty on third down extended their drive. The Niners, though, blew their own opportunity by having to settle for a field goal in the red zone. 10:20 p.m. The first use of the NFL’s new overtime rule comes in the Super Bowl. No longer can the team that gets the ball first win it immediately with a touchdown. Both teams must posses the ball. Butker makes late field goal, forces OT Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker forced overtime with a 29-yard field goal with 3 seconds left to make the score 19-19. It’s familiar territory for Kyle Shanahan. The 49ers coach was part of the only other OT game in Super Bowl history when he was the Falcons’ offensive coordinator seven years ago. That was the 28-3 blown lead to the Patriots. Moody makes amends with go-ahead kick Jake Moody became the first kicker to make two 50-plus field goals in a Super Bowl –- and this one might be enough to give the 49ers the Super Bowl. His 53-yarder with 1:53 left gave San Francisco a 19-16 lead. Moody made up for a missed extra point. But Patrick Mahomes will get the ball. He’s shown what he can do in 13 seconds. Mahomes will have a lot more time now. Chiefs stall in red zone, settle for tying field goal in 4th Big stop for the 49ers. They kept the Chiefs out of the end zone even though they had first-and-goal at the 4, forcing a tying field goal with 5:46 left. Both teams have missed opportunities, so in that way, it’s kind of evened out. Now Brock Purdy can shed the quarterback-manager label or Patrick Mahomes will add to his extraordinary legacy. 9:45 p.m. Eastern 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan went for it. All Niners fans probably couldn’t believe it when he eschewed a field goal on fourth-and-3 early in the fourth quarter and converted it. San Francisco scored a touchdown to take a 16-13 lead. 16-13? The extra point was blocked, keeping the Chiefs within three. Could be huge. San Francisco’s Jauan Jennings joined Nick Foles as the only players to throw a touchdown pass and catch one in a Super Bowl. Foles did it six years ago for the Eagles against the Patriots. 9:30 p.m. Eastern One play after the 49ers had a punt bounce off one of their players and get recovered by Kansas City, Patrick Mahomes lofted a 16-yard pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling in the end zone to give the Chiefs a 13-10 lead in the Super Bowl. Valdes-Scantling was almost universally loathed by Chiefs fans for much of the season. He dropped several passes at crucial moments, including one that may have cost them a game. And considering he was the highest-paid wide receiver on a group that struggled all season, he became an easy target for failing to live up to his contract. But he had a big catch against Baltimore to help put away the AFC title game, and now has an even bigger one in the Super Bowl. San Francisco regretting missed chances The 49ers had their chances to put away the Chiefs. They might soon really regret it. A punt bounced off the Niners’ Darrell Luter’s leg, and Kansas City’s Jaylen Watson recovered at San Francisco’s 16. One play later, the Chiefs took their first lead of the game. You can’t hand any team, but especially a Super Bowl champion, those kinds of breaks. KC's defense locks down in third quarter Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce are the headliners, but the Chiefs are in the Super Bowl largely because of their defense. And did it show up in the third quarter. They forced three 49ers three-and-outs, holding San Francisco to 3 yards. Quarterback Brock Purdy is 4 for 12 for 17 yards since the start of the second quarter. Those game-management criticisms aren’t going away. One bit of good news for SF: Deebo Samuel is back after limping earlier with a hamstring issue. Chiefs make record 57-yard field goal, trail 49ers 10-6 Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker made a 57-yard field goal with 5:01 left in the third quarter, breaking a Super Bowl record from... two quarters ago. Jake Moody’s 55-yarder to open the scoring had been the longest in Super Bowl history, topping a 54-yarder by Buffalo’s Steve Christie. The kick came moments after a shirtless fan ran onto the field during a third-and-11. 9:20 p.m. Eastern 49ers receiver Deebo Samuel limped off the field early in the third quarter of the Super Bowl. San Francisco said it was a left hamstring injury and his return is questionable. The Niners’ do-everything receiver went down on a third-down pass on San Francisco’s second drive of the third quarter. Trainers came out to attend to him before walking off under his own power. He went briefly to the injury tent. The 49ers have struggled this season when Samuel has been hurt. They lost three straight games in October when he hurt his shoulder and struggled for most of a divisional round win against Green Bay after he hurt his other shoulder on the opening drive. 9:10 p.m. Eastern Well, there was Usher. And Alicia Keys. But not so much to see after halftime. The Super Bowl is the NFL’s premier event, but the 49ers and Chiefs are playing like it’s the second game of the preseason. Penalties, punts and turnovers. Not exactly what the league wanted for the first big game in Las Vegas. At least there were the multiple cutaways on the stadium screens to Taylor Swift. 8:15 p.m. The Chiefs are on the board with a 28-yard field goal from Harrison Butker with 20 seconds left before halftime. The 49ers have done a nice job on Travis Kelce so far — even in the red zone, where he and the Chiefs are often so effective. Kelce only has one catch for 1 yard on the day. On that last third down from the San Francisco 9, he lined up in the slot and was covered by safety Ji’Ayir Brown. Kelce appeared to swing an arm in frustration when Patrick Mahomes was taken down before being able to throw. 8:00 p.m. The San Francisco 49ers got tricky for the first touchdown of the Super Bowl. Coach Kyle Shanahan dialed up a rare trick play that led to a TD pass from receiver Jauan Jennings to running back Christian McCaffrey. Brock Purdy started the play with a lateral to the left side to Jennings, who immediately threw it back to the other side to McCaffrey, who had a convoy of blockers and ran in for a 21-yard TD to put San Francisco up 10-0. McCaffrey has tied an NFL record with his seventh straight playoff game with at least 50 yards from scrimmage and a TD. San Francisco has moved to a 7 1/2-point favorite on FanDuel’s live line after the spread was a good bit closer at the start of the game. Taylor Swift chugs a drink, draws big applause There has been plenty of Taylor Swift on the big screens of Allegiant Stadium, and during the last timeout, cameras caught her in a race to chug what appeared to be a beer in her suite. Swift was the first to finish, and she triumphantly slammed the cup down as the video cut away to other fans. But not before an appreciative roar rippled through the stadium. If only the Chiefs were able to move the ball as successfully as she downed her drink. Their offense has gone nowhere in the first half of their Super Bowl showdown with the 49ers. ‘Bennifer’ is back for Super Bowl ad “Bennifer” has teamed up with Dunkin for a second Super Bowl in a row.

una pareja de San Antonio, quienes acusan que les dieron a consumir bebidas alcohólicas adulteradas. Anthony Grigsby, de 41 años, y su novia Rachel Villarreal, de 36, se encuentran varados en un hospital de Ciudad de México, tras haber consumido unas micheladas y otros tragos que presuntamente tenían otras sustancias que ellos aseguran desconocían. Lo que terminó convirtiendo su paseo turístico por la Ciudad de México en uno de los peores momentos para la pareja. Todo comenzó el pasado 14 de enero, cuando la pareja decidió volver a su hotel, luego de que Rachel comenzó con malestares: vómito, dolor de cabeza, de cuerpo y estómago. “Yo me empecé a sentir mal más tarde ese día con los mismos síntomas”, dijo Anthony Grigsby. Lo peor fue el siguiente día del paseo en las trajineras. Anthony despertó en su habitación de hotel con vómito y debilidad, solo para encontrar a Rachel tirada en el suelo. “Cuando desperté fue lo más horrible que he visto en toda mi vida: mi novia ahí tirada, inconsciente…”, dijo Anthony durante una entrevista a Univision 41. Ambos fueron trasladados a un hospital en la Ciudad de México, en donde Rachel fue intubada y puesta bajo un coma inducido debido a que presentaba inflamación en su cerebro. Anthony, quien no habla español, pudo comunicarse como pudo con los médicos y solo fue atendido por deshidratación severa. Exámenes médicos de toxicología revelaron que la pareja tenían anfetamina en su sangre, así como metanol y éxtasis. Según investigaciones locales, alguien pudo haber puesto estas sustancias en las bebidas que la pareja consumió durante el paseo y creen que pudo ser para intentar robarlos. “Yo y Rachel fuimos drogados en Xochimilco ese día"", afirma Anthony Grigsby. ""Hay historias de personas que dicen que esto pasa, que esta área es conocida como un área peligrosa, la gente se aprovecha de los turistas”. A pesar de estar a punto de morir y de que todavía se encuentra hospitalizada, Rachel ha mostrado mejoría, dicen sus familiares. “Casi muere y a este punto el doctor nos explicó que Rachel fue diagnosticada con deterioro neurológico y que ella iba a tener daño cerebral. Fue terrible”. La salud de Rachel ha mejorado: ya ha salido del coma inducido, su riñón funciona mejor, sus niveles se han estabilizado y ya puede respirar por sí misma. Aunque ambos tienen seguro médico, Anthony dijo que ha tenido problemas para comunicarse y no ha recibido el trato adecuado, presuntamente por estar en México. La compañía de seguros les dijo que la póliza es válida, pero que por ahora ellos tendrían que cubrir los gastos para luego ser reembolsados. Por ello, sus familias han tenido que pagar los gastos médicos de Rachel y de Anthony y a través de una cuenta de Go Fund Me pidieron ayuda a sus amigos para continuar cubriendo estos gastos en México. “Humilde y desesperadamente les pido que busquen en sus corazones y puedan donar. Estamos agradecidos de la fuerza de mi hermano y de que sobrevivió y tememos todavía por nuestra querida Rachel, quien todavía está luchando por su vida”, escribió Christina Grigsby-Vasquez, hermana de Anthony. Hasta este miércoles 7 de febrero, ambos se encuentran todavía en Ciudad de México. Rachel ha registrado mejoría y Anthony espera que ambos puedan ser trasladados a San Antonio en los próximos días. Según Mike Vigil, ex jefe de operaciones internacionales de la DEA, este tipo de ataques a turistas son muy comunes.

Austin was transported by his security detail to Walter Reed around 2:20 p.m. on Sunday after experiencing symptoms “suggesting an emergent bladder issue,” Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement Sunday. The deputy secretary of defense and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff were notified and notifications were sent to those in The White House and Congress, Ryder added. Austin is retaining his functions and duties of the office, while the deputy secretary is prepared should they need to assume duties, per Ryder’s statement. Austin returned to the Pentagon late last month after a weeks-long hospitalization in early January. Austin was hospitalized on Jan. 1 for an infection stemming from a Dec. 22 surgery for prostate cancer. The Defense Department said Austin conducted “his duties from home since his release from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Jan. 15.” His hospitalization sparked controversy on Capitol Hill after lawmakers learned the White House and Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks were not made aware of his hospitalization until Jan. 4. Austin did not reveal his prostate cancer diagnosis until Jan. 9, nearly a month after an early December health screening discovered the cancer. The incident prompted the Pentagon to launch a 30-day internal review of policies and procedures. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
