Davis, a 40-year-old resident of Oneonta, New York, has been indicted by the Delaware County Grand Jury on several charges related to sexual assault and criminal solicitation. Delaware County Acting District Attorney Shawn J. Smith made the announcement, highlighting the severe nature of the crimes alleged against the defendant. The indictment includes charges of predatory sexual assault against a child, criminal solicitation, and attempted sexual abuse. This development comes as a result of a thorough investigation by the New York State Police and the cooperation of Safe Against Violence, a support organization for victims of abuse. Count One of the indictment accuses Christopher D. Davis of predatory sexual assault against a child, a Class A-II felony. The indictment alleges that Davis engaged in a course of sexual conduct with a minor under the age of 13. This course of conduct is reported to have spanned nearly 8 years, starting when the child was only 7 and ending when she turned 13. The alleged acts include at least one instance of oral sexual conduct. If convicted, Davis faces a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. Counts Two, Three, and Four of the indictment charge Davis with criminal solicitation in the fourth degree, class A misdemeanors. According to the indictment, Davis repeatedly attempted to arrange for an adult mother to engage in oral sexual conduct with him and her minor daughters, aged 14 and 15, during the spring of 2023. Additionally, Count Five alleges that Davis committed another act of criminal solicitation in the fourth degree. The defendant is accused of attempting to induce an adult female to commit the felony crime of sexual abuse in the first degree. It is alleged that Davis and the other adult planned to drug a female friend to engage in sexual acts while she was physically helpless. Davis, who worked as a nurse in a nursing home, claimed to have access to the drugs from the facility where he was employed. Christopher D. Davis is currently held without bail at the Delaware County Correctional Facility. His arraignment on the indictment is scheduled for Tuesday, February 13, 2024. District Attorney Shawn J. Smith acknowledged the work of New York State Police Investigators James Fedor and Jacob Lakomski, along with Troopers Emily Martin and Allyson Head, who conducted a thorough investigation into the allegations. Smith also expressed gratitude to Safe Against Violence for their support in comforting the child victim during this challenging time. Gallery Credit: Dave Wheeler'}]"

Produced for City Lights Promotions by Queen of Snow Globes In today\'s video we repair a San Francisco Music Box Company Carousel Horse snow globe. This is a subscriber request. Thanks to our subscriber Lance who saw this globe in episode 84 (https://youtu.be/G1Bdl0Gy9ig). This is a nice piece. The horse and base are very colorful, fringed with roses and a base that resembles interwoven lace. The base has a plaque in the front that reads ""Friends"" and the music box plays ""That\'s what friends are for"". Also, Ally uses a new glitter that she found which gave it an interesting appearance. This was a routine fix and the globe looks really nice now. Thanks for watching!

In today\'s video we repair a Grand Piano snow globe from the San Francisco Music Box Company. One of Ally\'s favorite snow globe companies! This is one we have been eager to fix. Tony loves musical instruments. He doesn\'t play the piano, he is a guitar player, however, he has an appreciation for the beauty of musical instruments and this one is no exception. This globe contains only a grand piano, nothing else, which seems to highlight the instrument and put it up on a pedestal. The base is made of porcelain and is decorated with piano keys all the way around. The music box plays Fur Elise. The piano has become detached from the stopper. There is a large air...

President Biden is the focus and not Donald Trump, it\'s generally not a good thing for the president and his reelection prospects. That\'s because, like Trump, Biden has glaring vulnerabilities. His biggest one was front and center this week: concerns about his age. The special counsel report about Biden\'s handling of classified material didn\'t charge him with a crime, but special counsel Robert Hur, a Republican, seemed to go out of his way to include damning commentary about Biden\'s supposedly faulty memory, like referencing that Biden, 81, ""did not remember, even within several years, when his son Beau died."" That was stinging. ""It clears him legally and kneecaps him politically,"" Paul Begala, a veteran Democratic strategist and former Bill Clinton adviser, said of the report. The 388-page report set off a political firestorm — and an ensuing clumsy response from the White House and the president himself. Biden angrily rejected Hur\'s claim, saying Thursday night in a press conference he felt questions about Beau weren\'t ""any of their damn business."" The president got choked up while showing a rosary he was wearing on his wrist in memory of Beau, then thundered, ""I don\'t need anyone to remind me when he passed away."" If Biden had left it at that, that might be what people remembered about the news conference. Instead, Biden wound up walking right into the stereotype laid out by Hur when he mistakenly said that President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt was the ""president of Mexico"" while answering a question about current hostage negotiations with Israel and Hamas. It\'s a mistake. Verbal slips happen. Everyone makes them — including Trump, who is only four years younger than Biden. Trump often meanders, recently appeared to confuse his primary opponent Nikki Haley for former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; on more than half a dozen occasions in the past year mistakenly referred to former President Barack Obama when he should have said Biden; and while in Iowa, called ""Sioux City"" ""Sioux Falls,"" which is 90 miles up the road in South Dakota. But because more Americans are concerned with Biden\'s age and fitness to do the job in a second term than they are about Trump\'s age, every time Biden makes a flub it will have more resonance politically. ""It\'s certainly true that anything that feeds the master negative narrative is especially harmful,"" Begala said. ""For [Bill] Clinton, it was cheating, for [George W.] Bush, it was \'dumb,\' Obama \'elitist,\' which is why when Obama said 57 states, it didn\'t hurt him. If it was Bush, it would have."" ""Obviously with Biden, it\'s \'old.\' So, this really really hurts him."" At the White House Friday, Vice President Kamala Harris defended the Biden she sees out of public view, including after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel when Biden sat for hourslong depositions with Hur. ""I was in almost every meeting with the president in the hours and days that followed,"" Harris said, noting that Biden ""was in front of it all, coordinating and directing leaders who are in charge of America\'s national security, not to mention our allies around the globe for days and up until now — months. So the way that the president\'s demeanor in that report was characterized could not be more wrong on the facts and clearly politically motivated, gratuitous."" ""Fair or not, this just amplified Biden\'s greatest challenge,"" David Axelrod, a former senior adviser in the Obama White House, said of the special counsel report. ""It screams through every poll and focus group."" Axelrod went viral back in November for raising whether it was ""wise"" for Biden to run for reelection after a series of swing-state polls showed him losing to Trump. ""Many people have made a judgment about his age and command and discount his accomplishments and attribute every problem to it,"" Axelrod said. That rankles the White House. Democrats don\'t have a clear idea about how to handle the Biden age question or how to package the oldest president in history as a candidate. He\'s not likely to do lots of live TV interviews or massive campaign rallies. And his age raises the stakes for every public appearance, like his State of the Union address in less than a month. Certainly, the pandemic may have conditioned voters to not expect a candidate to do as many events and large rallies as in past elections. That could give the Biden team an opportunity to think creatively about playing to his strengths, in small groups, like when he went to a cookout in North Carolina and went viral. Plus, the economic environment has gotten less dire, Biden is a recognizable brand, and, most importantly, he has an opponent who is, in many surveys, more disliked than Biden and facing much more serious legal troubles. Hur himself pointed out in his report that what Trump is alleged to have done with his handling of classified documents dwarfs anything Biden did. ""Unlike the evidence involving Mr. Biden,"" Hur wrote, ""the allegations set forth in the indictment of Mr. Trump, if proven, would present serious aggravating facts. Most notably, after being given multiple chances to return classified documents and avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite. According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it."" The bottom line is that Trump might not have been charged either if he\'d just given the stuff back. But instead, the whole ordeal highlights why Trump is also so vulnerable politically. He apparently felt the rules didn\'t apply to him, that the boxes upon boxes of classified documents found at his home in Florida should be his to keep and allegedly hid them on purpose and chose not to fully cooperate. It\'s emblematic of why so many see Trump as a threat to democracy. He lied to the country to try to stay in power and schemed to overturn an election he lost, convincing millions falsely that the election was stolen and is using it as fuel for another run. So with nine months to go until Election Day, it\'s doubtful that the Hur report and Biden\'s Mexico-Egypt flub was a turning point in the campaign. ""The president\'s age is not a surprise to anyone,"" said Joel Payne, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Hillary Clinton. ""It\'s not a new data point. He was elected comfortably as a 77-year-old man four years ago. So, in many ways, it\'s baked in. People are not coming to Joe Biden seeking youthful vigor — he\'s been at an advanced age since he was elected vice president 16 years ago. The country turned to him in 2020 to lower the temperature and restore some normalcy, and that\'s happened broadly speaking."" Many Democrats would prefer someone else at the top of the ticket in 2024, and there\'s a deep Democratic bench of possibilities. But there\'s no sign that Biden is stepping aside because, frankly, he doesn\'t seem to want to. The Biden campaign has stepped up attacks on Trump in recent weeks, but outside groups supporting him spent more than $50 million in 2023, mostly on ads touting Biden\'s accomplishments, like efforts to lower insulin prices, pass a child care tax credit and to push for renewable energy. And his approval ratings have only gone down. Biden was elected because of Trump (and his botched handling of the COVID pandemic). Begala said he hopes this week makes Biden and his team sharpen their focus and get fully into an anti-Trump campaign mode, because fundamentally, the frame of this election hasn\'t changed. The question remains, what matters more: Biden\'s age or a dislike of Trump? ""It\'s got to be all about Trump,"" Begala said. ""It\'s the only way. The only way is a wholeheartedly negative campaign."" Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.'}]"

(AP) — A former TV news reporter known for his aggressive on-camera demeanor is getting into New Jersey’s U.S. Senate race as a Republican candidate for the seat currently held by Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who’s facing federal corruption charges. Alex Zdan, 38, a former news reporter for News 12 New Jersey, announced his candidacy Friday in an online video showing him at the U.S.-Mexico border in Nogales, Arizona, where he called for an end to illegal border crossings in what has emerged as a major campaign theme for Republican candidates nationwide. The video depicts gaps in the border fence. Zdan joins a GOP field that is quickly filling with candidates, including Mendham Borough Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw on the GOP side. New Jersey has not elected a Republican to the U.S. Senate since 1972, but Republicans are hoping the turmoil surrounding Menendez gives them a pickup opportunity in the narrowly divided chamber. The Democratic primary remains unsettled, with Menendez not yet saying if he’ll seek reelection even as he has pleaded not guilty to federal charges that he took bribes in exchange for helping foreign countries. He’s vowed to fight the charges, though many of his fellow Democrats have abandoned him and some have said he should resign. A contest between New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy and Rep. Andy Kim is taking center stage, though other Democrats, including civil rights activists Lawrence Hamm and labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina, have also stepped into the ring. Zdan left TV journalism after being laid off during cutbacks at News 12 late last year. He frequently clashed with Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy during the governor’s COVID-19 news conferences, asking aggressive questions, and got attention in 2020 when he told a Trump supporter who interrupted a news report to “buzz off.” In a phone interview, Zdan said it’s time for a new generation of conservative leaders focused on winning working class and multicultural voters and that he decided to move from journalism to politics because he views reporting as a public service. “If you know me and you know my energy and my abilities and my desire to serve and make people’s lives better, it kind of makes sense to go from the anchor desk to the floor of Congress,” he said.

Even though snowfall totals have been low snowmobile enthusiasts are still getting out and hitting the trails, Oneida County Sheriff Rob Maciol issued an urgent message to residents to be aware of their surroundings. Even with warmer temperatures and a lack of heavy snowfall, people still need to remember the dangers of riding a sled or snowmobile. The New York State Police reported over the weekend the death of a Massachusetts man. State Police say they were called to the trails by Culpepper Road in the Lewis County Town of Montague Saturday morning at approximately 2:47 a.m. for a report of a snowmobile crash with serious injuries. A further investigation determined that 33-year-old Richard M. Mangiardi Jr. of Pittsfield, Massachusetts was operating an Arctic Cat snowmobile with friends and family when he failed to negotiate a curve. His vehicle then exited that trail and hit a tree. State Police say he suffered a fatal head injury and was pronounced dead at the scene. One of the major risks that snowmobile riders are facing now with warmer temperatures, especially in one of the coldest months of the year, is ice or lack thereof. Oneida County Sheriff Rob Maciol told WIBX Monday that he is very concerned about the back-to-back weekend deaths and urged people to pay attention to their surroundings. The sheriff is also concerned about ice fishermen. Maciol says, A lot of people also enjoy ice fishing. You have to know the thickness of the ice and the right equipment. It's important to know where the current is and how the water is moving under the ice. Not only do you put your own life at risk, but first responders at risk as well. Folks have to take a few minutes to realize where they are and what they're doing. There is a website through the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation that acts as a guide to ice fishing enthusiasts, which you can find HERE. Now, most experienced snow mobile operators can tell when it's safe and unsafe to ride out onto a lake. But, there are several people who come to Upstate New York from other areas who aren't familiar with the geography and waterways of our region. Some people are simply inexperienced on a snowmobile. It is imperative to think about this factor when hitting the trails. Gallery Credit: Credit - Polly McAdams Gallery Credit: Credit - Polly McAdams Gallery Credit: Credit - Polly McAdams""}]"

Meanwhile, some Republicans in Tallahassee are looking for ways to ensure control over marijuana potency in the state. President Joe Biden is urging Congress to pass the bipartisan border proposal that appears all but dead. A deal struck by members of the Senate this weekend has quickly fallen apart amid opposition from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump. If passed into law, it would provide aid to Ukraine, Israel, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and give the president money and tools to help secure the border and speed up asylum claims. â\x80\x9cWith the new policies in this bill and the additional 4,300 asylum officers, who spend hours, I might add, with each immigrant to consider their claims whether they qualify. Weâ\x80\x99ll be able to reduce that process to six months, not five to seven years,â\x80\x9d Biden said about the proposal. The bill was deemed dead on arrival by House Republican Leadership. The southern border came up in a Senate committee meeting Monday in Tallahassee during confirmation questioning of Mark Thieme, who Gov. Ron DeSantis has appointed to lead the Florida State Guard. Central Florida Sen. Victor Torres laid out his concerns over sending the Florida Guard to Texas to assist with border enforcement. â\x80\x9cBeing deployed from this state, what we do weâ\x80\x99re covered, and I want our men and women who are deployed to make sure that they are â\x80\x94 the legality of the circumstance of being sent to another state â\x80\x94 that they are protected,"" Torres said. ""I donâ\x80\x99t want them to go over to another state and be caught in something that could be dangerous for them, or involved in some kind of shooting."" Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried posted on X, saying: â\x80\x9cRepublicans are an existential threat to our national security. They care more about using the fear of migrants coming into our country to help trump than actually solving the problem. Itâ\x80\x99s like a 2 yo who has been screaming for his pacifier & once he gets it he still screams because he just wants to scream."" On Jan. 31, DeSantis called on the Florida National Guard plus the Florida State Guard to, â\x80\x9cStop the invasion.â\x80\x9d â\x80\x9cLetâ\x80\x99s all band together as states,"" he said.

The governor is offering up to 1,000 members of the National Guard to support Operation Lone Star. He is mobilizing the Florida State Guard, too, making this the organization\'s first deployment in state history. DeSantis said the forces will build barriers, throw down wire and establish barricades along the southern border. â\x80\x9cThe federal government is no longer protecting the states,"" State Sen. Blaise Ingoglia said. ""Not the state of Texas, but all the states. The states have a right to protect their citizens."" Lawmakers tackle marijuana potency ahead of amendment vote A new proposal can be seen as Floridaâ\x80\x99s first effort to get ahead of the potential legalization of recreational marijuana in the state. Itâ\x80\x99s no secret that some Republicans are opposed to legalized recreational marijuana in Florida, but others say while they canâ\x80\x99t necessarily stop it, they can try to contain it. Before a vote is cast in November on a potential amendment, some Republicans are trying to a put caps on marijuana potency with Senate Bill 7050. State Sen. Gayle Harrell was worried about the possibility of marijuana soon hitting Florida markets. â\x80\x9cThere is no doubt that this high-potency cannabis has a real risk of psychosis for many, many people, especially young people,â\x80\x9d Harrell said. Voters in November will probably decide the fate of recreational marijuana, as the amendment on the ballot, if approved, would let Floridians to freely posses and smoke marijuana. But under Tuesdayâ\x80\x99s Republican bill, lawmakers could limit just how strong that marijuana is. â\x80\x9cThe problem is, it feels like a preemptive strike to regulate a future ballot initiative,"" said Will Clark of the Libertarian Party of Florida. ""Is that really what we want to do? Gov. DeSantis says this is the free state of Florida."" There is, however, bipartisan concern. Some lawmakers are calling these caps arbitrary. Others, meanwhile, feel it may promote a black market. â\x80\x9cWith a cap, now maybe we push a consumer to push to go in a different direction to find something higher on a market that is not safe or legal,â\x80\x9d State Sen. Tracie Davis said. This effort comes as the Florida Supreme Court considers whether recreational marijuana will appear on the November ballot. Attorney General Ashley Moody is trying to kill the amendment, saying itâ\x80\x99s confusing to voters. Florida ranks No. 1 in the backlog of immigration cases, according to federal data collected by Syracuse University. The data show the U.S. court backlog of cases involving immigrants and asylum seekers is more than 3 million â\x80\x94 481,000 of which are in Florida. Tampa immigration attorney Milton Toro Marquez has worked with immigrants for the past seven years and handles more than 100 clients, with a case list growing fast â\x80\x94 especially over the last couple of years. â\x80\x9cItâ\x80\x99s something thatâ\x80\x99s very stressful, and at the same time very rewarding,â\x80\x9d Marquez said. Marquez believes the immigration system is broken and that cases can take years to get resolved because of backlogs. He said each case is unique, and that each has a story of escaping a rough life. â\x80\x9cPeople are sexually violated on their way here, people are robbed, people are beaten on their way here,â\x80\x9d Marquez said. However, Marquez said despite the growing caseload, the work is important since most of his clients fear returning to their home country.'}]"

(AP) — A former TV news reporter known for his aggressive on-camera demeanor is getting into New Jersey’s U.S. Senate race as a Republican candidate for the seat currently held by Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who’s facing federal corruption charges. Alex Zdan, 38, a former news reporter for News 12 New Jersey, announced his candidacy Friday in an online video showing him at the U.S.-Mexico border in Nogales, Arizona, where he called for an end to illegal border crossings in what has emerged as a major campaign theme for Republican candidates nationwide. The video depicts gaps in the border fence. Zdan joins a GOP field that is quickly filling with candidates, including Mendham Borough Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner and southern New Jersey businessman Curtis Bashaw on the GOP side. New Jersey has not elected a Republican to the U.S. Senate since 1972, but Republicans are hoping the turmoil surrounding Menendez gives them a pickup opportunity in the narrowly divided chamber. The Democratic primary remains unsettled, with Menendez not yet saying if he’ll seek reelection even as he has pleaded not guilty to federal charges that he took bribes in exchange for helping foreign countries. He’s vowed to fight the charges, though many of his fellow Democrats have abandoned him and some have said he should resign. A contest between New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy and Rep. Andy Kim is taking center stage, though other Democrats, including civil rights activists Lawrence Hamm and labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina, have also stepped into the ring. Zdan left TV journalism after being laid off during cutbacks at News 12 late last year. He frequently clashed with Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy during the governor’s COVID-19 news conferences, asking aggressive questions, and got attention in 2020 when he told a Trump supporter who interrupted a news report to “buzz off.” In a phone interview, Zdan said it’s time for a new generation of conservative leaders focused on winning working class and multicultural voters and that he decided to move from journalism to politics because he views reporting as a public service. “If you know me and you know my energy and my abilities and my desire to serve and make people’s lives better, it kind of makes sense to go from the anchor desk to the floor of Congress,” he said.

IVO PANAYOTOV: Grass turned upside down. There is actually one tree that is fallen from the mudslide. It looks like a hurricane went through it. ROTT: So LA Mayor Karen Bass and city officials said that more than 120 debris flows have been reported as of last night just in the city of Los Angeles alone, and we know that there have been many others in the broader region. MARTIN: Do we have any sense of how much longer these mudslides are going to be a risk for people? ROTT: I mean, as long as it keeps raining and probably a little bit after, 'cause when I say, like, the ground is saturated here, Michel, I mean, it is wet. You know, downtown Los Angeles got more than 6 inches of rain in less than 24 hours. Parts of the Santa Monica Mountains just north of the city had upwards of 10 inches. So any more rain on those areas could trigger additional debris flows. MARTIN: And do we have a sense of how much longer it's going to be raining? ROTT: Yeah, the question everybody wants to answer, right? I talked to a meteorologist at the National Weather Service here last night who said this river of transported tropical moisture, this atmospheric river is weakening, but it's definitely not over yet. It's raining right now outside of my house. And we should continue to see scattered showers and thunderstorms through Wednesday. But, you know, where I am, about an hour's drive north of Los Angeles, even with the rain, people are definitely feeling like the worst of this is over. I visited a part of Ventura yesterday that had been flooded earlier this week and talked to the owner of my favorite surf shop, which had water standing up to its entrance on Sunday, and they were able to keep it out with sandbags. The store's owner, Bill Hubina, says unless flood infrastructure gets improved in this area, in his opinion, he doesn't think they're going to continue to be so lucky in the future. BILL HUBINA: This will continue getting worse every year till we really do flood eventually. But it's just Mother Nature, and tides are rising and global warming, basically. MARTIN: So I heard him say it's global warming, Nate, but is that what's really driving these rains? ROTT: So this is a very complicated answer, Michel. Look; we know sea levels are rising. We know the coastlines are changing. With atmospheric rivers, it's a little more complicated. Basically, scientists know that human-caused climate change is making precipitation events more likely. Warm air holds more moisture. What - they have not detected a signal of that, though, in the data so far. MARTIN: That is NPR's Nathan Rott in Ventura, Calif. Nate, take care of yourself. ROTT: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: OK, this may sound confusing, but former President Donald Trump will not be on the ballot in today's primary in Nevada. FADEL: But he's assured to sweep the state's 26 delegates. That's because there are actually two nominating contests in Nevada - today's primary, which Nikki Haley is on the ballot for, and Thursday's caucus, where Trump is the only major candidate participating. MARTIN: NPR's Franco Ordoñez is in Las Vegas, where local voters are also trying to make sense of it all. Good morning, Franco. FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel. MARTIN: OK, simple question - why are there two contests? ORDOÑEZ: Yeah, it is a simple question, but not really a simple answer. It's kind of part of a conflict between the state Republican Party, which is run by Trump allies, and a state law that mandates the primary must be held. Nevada actually has long held caucuses, but the state Legislature passed a law in 2021 switching to a more straightforward primary vote. But the nominating contests are run by political parties and not the state, and the Nevada Republican Party decided to stick with a caucus, which awards the 26 delegates. So voters will be heading to the polls today, and Nikki Haley is almost guaranteed to win, but it's largely a symbolic victory. MARTIN: You've been talking to voters. What do they make of all this? Are they able to make sense of this? ORDOÑEZ: I mean, it's caused a lot of problems. I was out talking to voters yesterday. I mean, there were some Republicans who still didn't know whether they should be voting in the primary or the caucus. You know, I talked with Kathy Eskandani (ph) just south of the strip. She kind of summed up the feelings of a lot of voters here. KATHY ESKANDANI: I was shocked. I looked at my sample ballot and told my husband, Donald Trump isn't on the ballot. Like, what is that? Nikki Haley's there, a couple other names I didn't know, but no Trump. ORDOÑEZ: And even more confusing, registered Republicans can vote in both the primary and the caucus. There's no law prohibiting them from doing so. So all of this has just led to accusations of conspiracy and election fraud. Chuck Muth, a local Republican political consultant, told me it just makes the state look bad. CHUCK MUTH: It's a total disaster from a public relations standpoint 'cause even active Republicans who are very attuned to what's going on are completely confused by why this is being done the way it's being done. ORDOÑEZ: Now, Michel, on the flip side, there are local - other local pundits that say that, or at least told me that it's raised attention about the contest and may have actually boosted Republican registration. MARTIN: OK. So what do we think this means for the race? ORDOÑEZ: It's all just kind of weird. I mean, you're basically going to have two winners this week in Nevada. You know, there's also a lot of talk in political circles that more people could show up at the primaries, and Haley could get more votes than Trump does in the caucuses. That would certainly be embarrassing for Trump. So I'll be watching for that. But again, if it does, it won't change the fact that Trump gets all the delegates. MARTIN: OK. Reminder - Republicans aren't the only ones voting this week, though, right? The Democrats are, too, right? ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. You're absolutely right. I mean, while Republicans are also trying to figure all their stuff out, Democrats are also voting today, and it's also an election with a clear winner in President Biden. So while the outcome for the primary may be set, Nevada is just such an important state in the general election. It's actually the first of the big six swing states to vote in a primary, making it extra important. The campaigns are out looking to test messaging and get any information they can as they prepare for November. MARTIN: That's NPR's Franco Ordoñez in Las Vegas. Franco, thank you. ORDOÑEZ: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Dartmouth College, an Ivy League school in New Hampshire, announced it is reinstating standardized testing requirements - the SAT or the ACT - as a requirement for admission after going test-optional during the pandemic. FADEL: Dartmouth says that the decision is based on research the college did that shows including a test score might have actually helped disadvantaged students get in. MARTIN: NPR's Elissa Nadworny covers higher""}]"

Please enter a valid zipcode. Save NEW YORK (AP) â\x80\x94 More gains for U.S. stocks on Friday sent Wall Street to its latest record, milestone and winning week. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% and finished a day above the 5,000 level for the first time. Itâ\x80\x99s the 10th record in less than a month for the index, which closed its 14th winning week in the last 15 to continue a romp that began around Halloween. The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.2% to pull within 0.4% of its own all-time high, which was set in 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a laggard a day after setting its own latest record. It slipped 54 points, or 0.1%. Milestones like the S&P 500 at 5,000 donâ\x80\x99t carry much weight for a market thatâ\x80\x99s supposed to move on hard numbers like interest rates, profits and revenue. But they can juice up the animal spirits of a market that can also be prone to emotional moves. Wall Streetâ\x80\x99s rally got going with hopes that cooling inflation would get the Federal Reserve to dial down the pressure by cutting interest rates. Lately, such cuts look to be coming later than hoped because reports keep showing a remarkably solid economy. But that strength has in turn raised expectations for profits from companies, supporting stocks. Cloudflare was the latest company to soar after reporting stronger profit than analysts expected for its latest quarter. The cloud-services company jumped 19.5% after it said it signed both its largest new customer and its largest renewal ever, despite an overall economic environment that â\x80\x9cremains challenging to predict.â\x80\x9d Big Tech stocks did most of the marketâ\x80\x99s heavy lifting, as theyâ\x80\x99ve been doing for more than a year, in part on mania around artificial-intelligence technology. Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon were the three strongest forces lifting the S&P 500 after each rose by at least 1.6%. They helped offset a 3.6% drop for PepsiCo, which reported weaker revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said growth is slowing because customers are getting back to their snacking and other behaviors from before the pandemic. Expedia tumbled 17.8% despite also reporting stronger profit than expected. The company gave forecasts for the first three months of 2024 that analysts said pointed to slower growth in bookings. The company also announced a new CEO, Ariane Gorin, will take over in May. Take-Two Interactive, the publisher of â\x80\x9cGrand Theft Autoâ\x80\x9d and other video games, sank 8.7% after it reported weaker profit than expected. It also cut its forecast for results for its fiscal year, which ends at the close of March. All told, the S&P 500 rose 28.70 points to 5,026.61. The Dow slipped 54.64 to 38,671.69, and the Nasdaq gained 196.95 to 15,990.66. Profits have largely been coming in better than expected for the big companies in the S&P 500 this reporting season, which is roughly two-thirds finished. That's usually the case, but even more companies than usual are doing so this time around, according to FactSet. That has helped optimism rise on Wall Street, but contrarians say it may have gone too far and carried stocks to too-expensive heights. Traders are flowing into some riskier investments at a quick enough pace that a contrarian measure kept by Bank of America is leaning more toward â\x80\x9csellâ\x80\x9d now than â\x80\x9cbuy,â\x80\x9d though itâ\x80\x99s not at convincing levels. The measure tracks how much fear and greed are in the market, and it suggested buying in October when fear was at a convincing high. In the bond market, Treasury yields inched higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.16% from 4.15% late Thursday. But the movements were much calmer than earlier in the month, when the 10-year yield leaped up from 3.85% as traders forcefully pushed out their forecasts for rate cuts. It's an encouraging signal that the stock market can keep hitting highs when expectations are dimming for an imminent cut to interest rates, particularly after the market earlier seemed to be moving solely on such forecasts. â\x80\x9cA less emotional market is a positive sign, though investors must fight against the complacency that is a natural reaction to such a strong and steady bull run,â\x80\x9d said Mark Hackett, Nationwide's chief of investment research. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mostly modestly lower. In Asia, several markets were shut for the Lunar New Year holiday. Tokyoâ\x80\x99s Nikkei 225 edged up by 0.1% after touching a 34-year high earlier in the day. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Yuri Kageyama contributed. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

NEW YORK CITY - The NYPD arrested two more suspects, and still seek five more, in connection with the assault of two police officers Saturday near a migrant shelter in Times Square. According to police, Yohenry Brito, 24, and Jandry Barros, 21, were arrested Wednesday night and charged with robbery and felony assault. However, only Brito was charged with robbery and felony assault in the attack. Concerning Barros, District Attorney Alvin Bragg\'s office declined to prosecute, citing a lack of evidence to prove his involvement. So far, in total, seven people have been arrested. Police initially arrested four people, and then a fifth person Monday. They’ve been identified as Jhoan Boada, 22, Kelvin Servita Arocha, 19, Wilson Juarez, 21, Darwin Andres Gomez-Izquiel, 19, and Yorman Reveron, 24. Featured Outrage is growing after two NYPD officers were beaten while attempting to break up a crowd of men outside of a migrant shelter in Midtown Manhattan.

It appears to be an ordinary exchange until the pair of officers attempt to take down one of the men in yellow. Surveillance video provided by the NYPD near Times Square. According to police, that\'s when the encounter turned violent, starting with a kick to an officer\'s head. Police said it only escalated from that point on where, moments later, the men swarmed around the officers already on the ground, striking them both multiple times. ""Do you want to know why our cops are getting assaulted? There are no consequences."" ""You saw the video,"" said NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell. ""Reprehensible. Cowards.""

In a video taped after the interview, Carlson told viewers that he found Putin to be sincere, if not adept at making his case to an American audience. ""He denied it, but it\'s obvious he\'s very wounded by the rejection of the West,"" Carlson said. ""Like a lot of Russians he expected the end of the Cold War would be Russia\'s invitation into Europe."" It is the first interview Putin has granted to an American since the Russian invasion two years ago. The pairing should not come as a surprise. Carlson has routinely been lionized by Kremlin propaganda outlets; his clips attacking the Biden administration\'s support for Ukraine have been routinely rebroadcast, for example. Russian media has fawned over Carlson this week, giving his comings and goings in Moscow a treatment akin to U.S. media\'s coverage of Taylor Swift. Carlson filmed a video to promote the interview on the rooftop of the Ritz Carlton Hotel near the Red Square, a location that, according to Russian journalist Yevgenia Albats, spoke volumes of the regard the Kremlin held for Carlson. ""Its roof is controlled by one of the KGB\'s successors, the Federal Security Service,"" she postedon X, formerly known as Twitter. ""No one of us, and no one other foreign journalist, except for Oliver Stone, had that luxury of reporting from the roof top."" Few have done more than Carlson to lift up the Russian leader as a figure of admiration in Republican circles, just as he has propelled the otherwise relatively obscure Viktor Orban, Hungary\'s autocratic leader, to star status. In that promotional video, Carlson had said he wanted to interview Putin about the war in Ukraine to learn the truth – and because other American journalists were too biased against Russia to want to do so. This was clearly false; Reporters at CNN and the BBC and executives at NPR and Fox were among those who said their networks would be eager to interview Putin without conditions. Even the Kremlin contradicted Carlson\'s claims, saying it had received and rejected requests from ""exceptionally one-sided"" U.S. outlets. So was it a hard-hitting interview holding a wartime leader to account? Putin dominated the conversation – which exceeded two hours – with long, discursive asides relying on propagandistic talking points to argue that Russia\'s right to eastern Ukraine spans centuries. (Ukrainian leaders and many historians dispute his rendering of the history of the region.) The Russian leader blamed the Ukrainians for the 2022 invasion. Carlson did not question Putin\'s framing. Nor did he use the word ""invasion"" to describe the deployment of Russian troops and missiles into Ukraine that kicked off the war. ""We were protecting our people, ourselves, our homeland and our future,"" Putin told Carlson, according to the interpreter of the exchange. Putin appeared to have done opposition research worthy of the KGB agent he once was. He needled Carlson at separate moments about having been a history major and having applied (unsuccessfully) for a position at the Central Intelligence Agency. At the tail end of the interview, Carlson pressed Putin to release Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned by Russian authorities nearly a year ago on charges of espionage - charges the newspaper stoutly rejects. He suggested Putin should not hold Gershkovich as a pawn to trade for, say, the release of a Russian spy. ""The guy\'s obviously not a spy, he\'s a kid,"" Carlson said of Gershkovich. ""And maybe he was breaking your law in some way, but he\'s not a super spy and everybody knows that. And he\'s being held hostage in exchange, which is true. With respect, it\'s true. And everyone knows it\'s true."" Carlson did not raise the fate of Alsu Kurmasheva, a dual U.S.-Russian citizen who is a reporter for the U.S.-funded network Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. She was detained and charged last year with failing to register as a foreign agent. And Carlson notably did not press Putin on thearrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court for him and his child welfare commissioner on accusations of war crimes. ""I\'m from La Jolla, California. I\'m not flacking for Putin. Please,"" Carlson said in the post-interview video. He then said ""professional liars in Washington"" want to convince the public that Putin is a modern-day Adolf Hitler, and called State Department officials idiots for thinking Russia has expansionist ambitions into Poland or other countries. ""We are run by nutcases – the president and that poisonous moron, [Acting Deputy Secretary of State Victoria] Nuland,"" Carlson said. Carlson has spent years attacking those who made the case that the Russian regime sought to sow discord in the 2016 elections through online disinformation, that former President Donald Trump\'s campaign took advantage in the chaos, and that some of Trump\'s key allies had links to the Russians. Trump\'s national security advisor, Michael Flynn, resignedafter it was revealed he had lied about specific policy discussions with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. ahead of taking office. Carlson also has spent much of his time trolling both his former network and Trump critics, while leaping to defend those who laid siege to the U.S. Capitol in January 2021 in an effort to prevent the certification of President Biden\'s 2020 win, despite the protests of some of his colleagues at Fox. Fox News fired Carlson – then the network\'s biggest star – last spring. His key role in amplifying baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 elections had been revealed in a defamation lawsuit against the network that led to a $787 million settlement; Fox paid another $12 million to settle claims by a former producer that Carlson had created a sexist and bigoted workplace. Evidence that became public demonstrated Carlson\'s wide-ranging contempt — for his viewers, Trump, his reporting colleagues and, particularly, the executives who ran his network. After being kicked off Fox, Carlson moved his operation to Twitter, saying it was the last major bastion of free speech. He then launched the digital Tucker Carlson Network. Carlson has used that platform to interview subjects including the extremist conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who filed for bankruptcy after families of schoolchildren murdered in a Connecticut massacre won a $1 billion settlement against him; Martin Shkreli, a former pharmaceutical executive convicted of securities fraud; U.S. Rep. Majorie Taylor-Greene, who is known for embracing conspiracy theories; and the right-wing social media troll who goes by the nom-de-Tweet Catturd. For a former cable television star seeking to insinuate himself once more into the national conversation, Carlson was thwarted on Thursday by two current presidents and one former. News of President Biden, accused of memory lapses by a special prosecutor, overshadowed Carlson\'s video drop. The Russian president\'s tendentious historical claims overtook the interview. And, of course, there was Trump, whose ability to appear on Colorado\'s ballot dominated a historic Supreme Court argument earlier in the day. It is hard to gauge how wide an audience Carlson now has. (Statistics on views on X are unreliable.) But it is a far cry from the broad stage he had at Fox News, where he was seen by upwards of three million people on many nights. Copyright 2024 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.'}]"

The decision to tighten the restrictions on pollution from small particles, commonly referred to as soot, comes as a reversal of the Trump administration, which decided in 2020 to maintain a less stringent standard. In the year 2032, the first year that states will be required to meet the standard, the rule is expected to prevent up to 4,500 premature deaths, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said. EPA also projects that 99 percent of U.S. counties would reduce their pollution to the levels required under the rule with or without the agency’s action — as other policies are also shifting much of the country away from polluting vehicles and energy sources. But, areas that will not already meet the new standard will have to bring down their pollution levels — through state-led policies like requiring emitters to install pollution control technology — to meet the requirements. A spokesperson for the agency told The Hill via email that many counties projected to exceed the standards are highly and densely populated, so pollution reductions there will impact many people — resulting in significant health benefits. EPA Administrator Michael Regan told reporters that the rule would be “protecting millions of Americans and building a cleaner and healthier nation.” Exposure to this type of pollution has been linked to premature death, heart attacks and decreased lung function. Republicans and industry have pushed back on the EPA’s move, saying that compliance will be too difficult and ultimately harm the economy. Ahead of November’s election, Republicans have sought to paint Biden’s record as generally bad for the economy, tensions that Wednesday’s move is sure to inflame. “The Biden administration’s punishing air standard finalized today is simply not realistic to meet,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), in a written statement. “To comply with this rule, states will need to limit development across large areas of the country, threatening manufacturing and energy projects, limiting economic growth, and leaving millions of Americans behind to deal with the negative consequences,” said Capito, the top Repulican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The EPA rule would set the standard for annual average air pollution at a level of 9 micrograms per cubic meter, down from 12 set under former President Obama and maintained under former President Trump. It is at the tighter end of what EPA proposed last year, at which point it said it planned to tighten air pollution limits to somewhere between 9 or 10 micrograms. Yet, it is also not as protective as the 8 micrograms per cubic meter level pushed by many environmental groups. Studies cited by EPA as part of its proposal found that a threshold of 8 could double the number of lives saved under the rule. Nevertheless, many environmental advocates cheered the rule overall. “We’re glad to see the Biden Administration answered the call to reduce harmful soot pollution,” said Sierra Club executive director Ben Jealous in a written statement. “The decision to strengthen the annual particulate matter standards is more than just policy; it’s about securing clean and safe air for our families and communities.” Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

The writing style and content are not particularly AI-like.', 'document_classification': 'HUMAN_ONLY', 'version': '2025-01-09-base', 'language': 'en', 'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': ""Last week, in honor of the new year, I published a column laying out some good news – which I’ve tried to do regularly during my 40 or so years in the news business. Maybe it’s to sort of counter the perception that we folks in the media only care about bad news. Now, it’s kind of egotistical to quote yourself, but in this case, it seems wasteful not to pass along my little list of Ten Good Things Happening Just Now, because they’ll be outdated momentarily. So with a bit more brevity than the patient readers of my columns in Upstate American (dot) com have come to expect, here are some departures from the generally gloomy reports that we journalists tend to present. Take heart, folks, from all this: First, the world is waking up to the climate crisis. Near the end of the hottest year on record — and probably the hottest of the past 150,000 years — the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 28) was moderately successful in trying to help the planet avoid the worst effects of global warming. It didn’t schedule a “phase-out” of planet-killing fossil fuels, but it did urge a “transitioning away” from the technologies that are causing catastrophic global warming – and 200 nations pledged to triple new investments in renewable energy. That’s a big deal. Plus, an historic “High Seas Treaty” was signed in the fall aimed at protecting one-third of the world’s oceans. We’re not doing enough to avert disaster, but we’re making progress toward that goal. Second among good news points: America’s economy is showing its resilience. Inflation is way down, a record number of Americans are working, and fears of a recession are, well, receding. The economy is growing brisky – over 5 percent last year – and consumer spending remains strong. You won’t hear this from Republican politicians or from their propaganda arm, Fox News, but this economic good news is clearly a result of carefully calibrated federal monetary and fiscal policies. Third bit of good news: Some liars are being held to account. Speaking of Fox News, the “infotainment” giant agreed to pay more than $787 million to settle a lawsuit based on its knowingly false reporting backing up Donald Trump’s Big Lie about the election – showing that even in a society that rightly guards free speech, intentional disregard of truth can be expensive. That “thou shalt not lie” lesson was also presented to Rudy Giuliani, who declared bankruptcy to avoid having to pay a $148 million jury award to two Georgia election workers whom he defamed. And George Santos finally got kicked out of Congress! There’s still a lot of cynical balderdash being peddled by partisans, but both courts and the court of public opinion are beginning to call it out. Fourth, justice is gaining on Donald Trump. The former president is finding the legal system less malleable than the so-called “low-information voters” who adore him. He is genuinely vulnerable as he faces 91 criminal counts in four separate prosecutions, as well as a collection of civil lawsuits, notably including New York Attorney General Tish James’ fraud suit. That could shut down Trump’s business in the state. We’ll see how the Trump-friendly U.S. Supreme Court rules on whether states have the right to block him from the ballot for violating the 14th amendment, but any reckoning for the mentally unbalanced man who is trying to subvert our democracy is good news, for sure. Good news item Number 5: Crime is falling. Despite partisan claims that the nation is awash in crime, the murder rate dropped in 2023 by one of the fastest rates ever – and many other forms of violent crime are also down. Yet: There were more mass shootings in 2023 than in the year before. But as we mourn those needless deaths, let’s note that the political clout of the National Rifle Association is waning as its finances collapse – and that means the chance for thoughtful gun control is rising. Good news item Number 6 is that we’re better protected against Covid-19, thanks to science and scientists. Seventh, workers are gaining power in the marketplace as those strike settlements favoring the United Auto Workers and the writers and actors in Hollywood show. That’s good because it’s a step toward the resurgence of the middle class that has been shrinking in America since the rise of Reaganomics in the 1980s. Number 8: Majorities are demanding their rights – that is, voters in seven states have restored abortion rights that were taken away by a Supreme Court that represents a minority of public opinion. Probably two dozen states will vote on abortion rights initiatives this year. So far, rights have prevailed everywhere that it has been on the ballot. Good news bit Number 9 involves Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Barbie of the movies and, in Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Which is to say that strong women are carrying the day. And, finally, it’s good news that good people are still making the world better. A toddler in Ontario who was face-down in icy water and technically dead is alive today because a team kept up with CPR for three hours. And in Virginia, when a troubled teenager leapt off a bridge, a stranger dove into the raging water below and dragged him to safety a mile downstream. There are countless stories of such goodwill each year — and no, they’re not ignored by the media. When we notice them, they help renew our hope in each other, don’t you think? So there: Ten examples of all the good news around us. You probably have your own ideas. So think on those on the many days when you’re probably almost overcome by the bad news globally or here at home. And, friends, keep hope alive.

I’ve been on the air since fall of 2012, and it took me about a year to see consistent results. From then on, I receive 1 new client per month on average from people who listen to my show, who trust and support me because I’m here. WYSL is a mom and pop station, a hidden gem in a cookie-cutter world. Its people are down-to earth people, my kind of people. It’s a place where the truth is still real.” “This has truly been THE most successful form of advertising we have ever done. Success for us is defined in two forms: 1. Hearing our current clients call us or email us to say that they heard the show and that they are dedicated WYSL listeners 2. Getting phone calls from new clients weekly that say that they have heard us on WYSL and want to schedule an appointment time with us. 3. The fan club,yes people want to meet me and tell their friends they met me! Do I see a return on our investment with WYSL? We calculated that we need to have a at least 5 clients each month to place insurance with us to cover the monthly cost of the show. Does that happen? Yes, it does. A slow week for us is getting only 1-3 new calls generated from the show. The calls are from individuals or couples wanting to have their insurance evaluated. That number grows to 4-12 new clients a month that are ready to switch their insurance or want to do so in the future.” “I can say that GoodNewsTalk response/feedback is increasing significantly. I think more people are seeking different /independent news sources vs the corporate media choices.” View FCC Public Inspection File | For assistance with Public File call 585-346-3000 or email info@wysl1040.com | FCC Applications Mailing Address:WYSL NewsPower 1040Box 236Avon, NY 14414-0236 Street Address – studios, officesand transmitting plant:WYSL NewsPower 10405620 South Lima RoadAvon, NY 14414-0236 Phone: (585) 346-3000Fax: (585) 346-0450 Website and live audio stream 24-7: www.wysl1040.com News Releases and News Stories: news@wysl1040.com Operational problems, questions: dangelo@wysl1040.com Sales inquires, advertising: savage@wysl1040.com General comments and questions: info@wysl1040.com © Radio Livingston Limited Website Design by Patrick Marketing NY'}]"

Please enter a search term. by: Mike Lillis, The Hill Posted: Feb 1, 2024 / 06:01 AM EST Updated: Feb 1, 2024 / 04:53 PM EST by: Mike Lillis, The Hill Posted: Feb 1, 2024 / 06:01 AM EST Updated: Feb 1, 2024 / 04:53 PM EST President Biden and Senate Democrats are facing an unlikely source of resistance as they race to secure a hard-fought deal linking Ukraine aid with tougher border security: their Democratic allies in the House. Until now, it appeared that the greatest threat to the emerging national security package would be House Republicans, who are vowing to quash the legislation in no uncertain terms. But if conservatives are lining up against the legislation for being too soft on would-be migrants, liberal Democrats are bashing it for being too hard on the same group. The Democratic critics — many of them representing the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), the Progressive Caucus, or both — are up in arms that they’ve been cut out of the Senate negotiations and furious that the emerging legislation appears to exclude key Democratic priorities. That list includes protections for asylum-seekers and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in the country, particularly a group of young people known as Dreamers. A large and growing chorus of these Democrats are already warning that they’ll oppose the legislation if it does somehow reach the House floor, creating a potential messaging headache for Biden and other Democratic leaders who are casting advance blame on Republicans for blocking Congress’s best shot in years at a bipartisan border bill. “Everything that I’ve heard that’s in this bill is going to set immigration reform — real comprehensive immigration reform — back 10 or 15 years,” said Rep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), the head of the Hispanic Caucus. “If there was something in there like pathways [to citizenship] or Dreamers, that would be a very different conversation,” she continued. “But there was no negotiation. It was really a hostage-taking, and saying, ‘OK, what more do you want?’ And it was mostly concessions on things that there’s evidence is not going to fix the problem.” The Democratic critics are quick to emphasize that no Senate deal has been finalized, and no formal legislative text has been released. But based on numerous media reports outlining some of the border changes purportedly locked into the bill, many House liberals say they’d oppose the package if those details ring true. “The things that are in the bill that were negotiated are things that are Trumpian kind of policies that have never worked to actually address the issues that we have,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “So I’m disappointed, frankly, that the president, the White House and some other Democrats are giving in to that kind of narrative, because it undermines what we really do need to do that would fix the problem.” The policy specifics are not the only source of contention. Liberals are also protesting the exclusion of Hispanic Caucus members at the negotiating table. “It’s been a major problem, and I also think it’s going to pose a major obstacle to having the Hispanic Caucus approve any deal that’s coming out,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said. “The problem is with the policy [and] the problem is with the process, in not having any CHC members deeply involved in this.” The criticisms are hardly universal. Some more moderate Democrats are quick to point out that, in a Washington of divided power, no party will get everything it wants, and that Democrats should be ready to accept some border compromises — especially with Ukraine funding on the line. “From what I’m hearing, the Democratic senators moved substantially. But I hear the Republicans moved substantially also,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks (N.Y.), the senior Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee. “And to me, that’s the way this place works, where nobody gets all of what he or she wants.” Still, the liberals see the Senate negotiations leaning too heavily in the favor of Republican priorities. Aside from the absence of citizenship pathways, the liberal critics are also blasting the bill for going too far to prevent would-be migrants from pursuing asylum and other legal avenues of entry into the U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), a former Progressive Caucus chair who represents almost all of the Arizona-Mexico border, said the solutions being proposed in the Senate bill “are more punitive than anything else.” “Right now my instincts are not to support it,” he said. “I’ve never supported what I hear is in there.” The pushback comes as a bipartisan group of Senate negotiators say they’re inching closer to a deal combining tougher border measures with military aid for Ukraine and Israel, humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza and help for Taiwan. The border piece has been the toughest lift, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday that, while negotiators are getting closer to a deal, there remain “a few issues to be resolved.” “The work is not easy, it’s very hard, but we keep making progress,” he said during a press briefing in the Capitol. The emerging deal has been panned by conservatives in both chambers, and their opposition has been fueled by former President Trump, the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination who is urging Republicans to oppose any border deal before he returns to the White House. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is on board with Trump’s call, saying the Senate bill, if the reported details are accurate, is “dead on arrival” in the lower chamber. And he’s getting plenty of support from conservatives, who say Biden has the power to end the border crisis on his own through executive actions, making congressional action unnecessary. “The president has the ability right now — the power — to stop it,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said this week. “But he chooses not to because this is all a sham and it’s purposeful. It’s a purposeful effort to dilute our society, and to undermine our way of life — to destroy Western civilization.” The Republicans’ fervent opposition to the emerging Senate deal has triggered allegations from Democratic leaders that their GOP counterparts — who had insisted on marrying Ukraine aid and border security at the outset of the talks — never intended to support such a package because it might help Biden as he seeks reelection. When Trump came out against the package, that strategy was sealed, Democrats say. “That is something that the Republican conference is going to have to wrestle with: that they are allowing the pro-Putin part of their majority to tie these issues together and then block any movement forward,” Rep. Katherine Clark (Mass.), the House Democratic whip, told reporters Wednesday in the Capitol, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Amid the debate, some Democrats have floated the idea that the House could overcome Johnson’s opposition to a Senate package by employing a discharge petition, which allows a simple House majority to force bills to the floor even over the objection of the majority party’s leaders. The liberal opposition to the border provisions, however, means that a number of Democrats would almost certainly refuse to sign the petition. Some said its prospects are as likely as Johnson bringing the bill to the floor voluntarily. “Whatever bipartisan deal comes out of the Senate — which would probably not have satisfied most of us Democrats — we won’t get to see that day anyway,” Grijalva said. “It would have been a tough vote here because there are a significant number of Democrats that feel that it’s just a punitive act.” –Updated at 7:58 a.m. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

George Santos â\x80\x94 offering a potential preview of the elections later this year to control the White House and Congress. Democrat Tom Suozzi on Thursday blasted House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, for not committing to put a potential bipartisan immigration deal up for a vote on the House floor, should one advance through the Senate. He told Spectrum News NY1 that it â\x80\x9cshouldâ\x80\x9d be a â\x80\x9cbig vulnerabilityâ\x80\x9d electorally for House Republicans if they oppose a bipartisan agreement negotiated by their counterparts in the Senate, especially after loudly sounding the alarm about the border for months. â\x80\x9cIf youâ\x80\x99re refusing to even negotiate, whatâ\x80\x99s the purpose of you being in Congress?â\x80\x9d he asked. Johnson is demanding that any border deal embody the kinds of hardline policies central to a plan passed by the House GOP, known as HR 2. It is considered dead on arrival in the Democrat-led Senate. But Republicans and Democrats in the Senate reportedly are close to a deal containing many policy changes that Democrats once opposed. Many Senate Republicans have said if they can finalize that deal, House Republicans should embrace it. So far, Johnson has refused to make such a commitment. Suozzi urged his Republican competitor, Mazi Pilip, to call on the speaker to accept a â\x80\x9cbipartisan deal.â\x80\x9d In a statement, Pilip said lawmakers should reach a â\x80\x9cbipartisan solution,â\x80\x9d and said the â\x80\x9cmigrant crisis that Tom Suozzi and Joe Biden created is destroying our communities.â\x80\x9d â\x80\x9cI believe Congress and the Senate need to come to a bipartisan solution to address it as soon as possible,â\x80\x9d she said. â\x80\x9cTime is of the essence, and partisan politics must be put aside, as the constant influx of migrants â\x80¦ continues to grow by the day.â\x80\x9d Pilip said that if elected, she would advocate for her own plan to address the border and the migrant crisis, including resuming construction of a border wall, tightening asylum standards, criminalizing â\x80\x9cvisa overstays,â\x80\x9d and increasing border patrol agents. The immigration debate also is taking center stage in the campaign ad wars. The National Republican Congressional Committee just unveiled an ad labeling Suozzi an â\x80\x9copen border radical,â\x80\x9d accusing him of â\x80\x9cbraggingâ\x80\x9d that he â\x80\x9ckicked ICE out of Nassau Countyâ\x80\x9d while serving as county executive. Asked about the ad, Suozzi pushed back touting his record. â\x80\x9cIâ\x80\x99ve been in politics off and on for the past 30 years,â\x80\x9d he said. â\x80\x9cPeople know me. The idea that Iâ\x80\x99m a member of The Squad or that I am sanctuary Suozzi â\x80¦ itâ\x80\x99s absurd.â\x80\x9d In his own recently released TV spot, Suozzi said he would â\x80\x9cwork across the aisle to do what our leaders havenâ\x80\x99t: secure our border.â\x80\x9d In the ad, he points to an op-ed he co-authored in 2019 with then-Congressman Peter King, a Republican, advocating for an immigration deal.'}]"
