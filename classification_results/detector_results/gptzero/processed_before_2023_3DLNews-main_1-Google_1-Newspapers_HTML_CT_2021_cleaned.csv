However, in today’s digital age, it’s crucial to establish a strong online presence to attract customers and stand out from the competition. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the key steps to start a small business while implementing effective search engine optimization (SEO) strategies to boost your online visibility and drive organic traffic to your website. Before diving into the business world, it’s important to identify your niche. Conduct thorough market research to understand your target audience, their needs, and the competition. By defining your niche, you can tailor your products or services to meet specific customer demands, which will set you apart in the market. A well-thought-out business plan serves as a roadmap for success. Define your business goals, strategies, target market, and competitive advantage. Conduct keyword research to identify relevant search terms for your industry, which will help you optimize your website’s content later on. Choose a domain name that reflects your business and is easy to remember. Ensure it is SEO-friendly by incorporating relevant keywords. Build a user-friendly website with a clean design, intuitive navigation, and mobile responsiveness. Optimize your website’s loading speed to provide visitors with a seamless browsing experience. Keywords are the foundation of SEO. Research and identify relevant keywords and phrases that potential customers are likely to use when searching for products or services in your industry. Tools like Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, or Moz Keyword Explorer can help you find valuable keywords with high search volumes and low competition. Develop informative and engaging content that addresses the needs of your target audience. Incorporate your researched keywords strategically throughout your website’s content, including titles, headings, meta descriptions, and body text. Remember to write for your readers first, ensuring the content is valuable, relevant, and well-structured. Backlinks are crucial for SEO as they signal to search engines that your website is trustworthy and authoritative. Reach out to relevant industry websites, bloggers, and influencers to secure quality backlinks. Create compelling content that others will naturally want to link to, and participate in guest blogging opportunities to expand your reach. Establish a presence on social media platforms that align with your target audience. Engage with your followers, share valuable content, and participate in industry discussions. Social media signals can contribute to your website’s visibility in search engine rankings, so ensure your profiles are optimized with relevant keywords and links to your website. If your small business operates within a specific geographic area, optimizing for local SEO is essential. Create a Google My Business profile and ensure your business information is accurate and up to date. Encourage customers to leave reviews, as positive ratings can improve your local search rankings. Regularly monitor your website’s performance using tools like Google Analytics. Analyze key metrics such as traffic sources, conversion rates, and bounce rates. Make data-driven decisions to refine your SEO strategies, improve user experience, and capitalize on new opportunities. Snowboarding is a thrilling winter sport that can be enjoyed in many places around the world, including the Pacific Northwest (PNW). The PNW is a region in the western United States that is home to some of the best snowboarding destinations in the country. If you’re a beginner looking to start snowboarding in the PNW, there are a few things you need to know to make the most of your experience. The PNW is home to many great mountains that are perfect for snowboarding. Some of the most popular destinations include Mount Hood, Crystal Mountain, and Stevens Pass. Before you choose a mountain, do some research to find one that fits your skill level. Many mountains have dedicated beginner areas that are perfect for those just starting out. These areas often have flatter terrain and slower lifts, making it easier to learn the basics. When you’re just starting out, it can be tempting to borrow or rent gear. However, investing in your own gear is a great way to ensure that you have a comfortable and safe experience on the mountain. You’ll need a snowboard, boots, bindings, and a helmet. Look for gear that is designed specifically for beginners, as it will be more forgiving and easier to control. One of the best things you can do as a beginner snowboarder is to take a lesson. Many mountains offer group and private lessons that are tailored specifically to beginners. A lesson will teach you the basics of snowboarding, including how to balance, turn, and stop. It will also give you the opportunity to learn from a qualified instructor who can provide feedback and help you improve your skills. Snowboarding is a cold sport, so it’s important to dress appropriately. Dress in layers so that you can adjust your clothing as you warm up or cool down. A waterproof jacket and pants are essential to keep you dry, and gloves or mittens will keep your hands warm. Don’t forget to wear a warm hat and goggles to protect your head and eyes. Learning to snowboard takes time and patience. It’s important to be patient with yourself and not get discouraged if you don’t progress as quickly as you’d like. Remember that everyone learns at their own pace, and the more you practice, the better you’ll get. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small, and keep working towards your goals. One competitive advantage nursing has over other professions is the breadth of professional advancement opportunities available to nurses. Working in a range of settings and assuming a number of positions in health care enables prospective career builders to find the profession that makes them feel the most at ease.

Aunque la lista comparativa entre la Venezuela de entonces y la de ahora podría ser más larga, existen ocho aspectos que se destacan: 1.- MIGRACIÓN En el primer trimestre de 2013, Venezuela aún recibía a unos pocos colombianos, peruanos o ecuatorianos que apostaban por la riqueza del país que tiene además una ingente cantidad de petróleo. Hoy el flujo migratorio es al revés y esas naciones albergan a cientos de miles de emigrantes venezolanos. Casi 5,5 millones de venezolanos, lo que representa cerca del 20 % de la población del país, han emigrado principalmente a través de las fronteras terrestres, convertidas en el último quinquenio en lugares de abundante movimiento. 2.- INSEGURIDAD El año en que murió Chávez, el país registró casi 25.000 homicidios, según estimaciones del Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia (OVV). Era precisamente la criminalidad el principal motivo de emigración del país, si bien esta nunca generó una diáspora. Según el mismo OVV, en 2020 las muertes violentas fueron 11.891, mientras que el Gobierno habla de un número menor a los 8.000 asesinatos. Aunque el líder fundador de la revolución implementó una decena de planes para disminuir los homicidios, fue durante la Administración de Maduro cuando estos números cayeron. 3.- POBREZA En los primeros 13 años de la revolución, Venezuela pasó de tener a la mitad de su población en la pobreza a menos de un tercio, un indicador que fue reconocido por la Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (Cepal). A la vez, el Gobierno decía luchar para erradicar la pobreza extrema, siempre estimada debajo del 10 %. Hoy, según estimaciones no oficiales, el 96 % de los venezolanos es pobre y el 80 % vive en la miseria, sin capacidad de cubrir necesidades básicas como la alimentación. 4.- LEGITIMIDAD Aunque el fallecido presidente fue señalado de autoritario, la legitimidad incuestionable de su Ejecutivo le permitió hacer negocios con todo el mundo y liderar escenarios políticos y económicos. Chávez murió en la Venezuela polarizada que él mismo, con su encendido discurso, atizó. Maduro, en cambio, es señalado de “dictador y violador de derechos humanos” por la oposición y por diversas organizaciones nacionales e internacionales. Con un presidente reelegido en unas votaciones cuestionadas, la política exterior es defensiva y el margen de maniobra financiero del país se ha diezmado. 5.- CONTROL DE CAMBIO El Estado fundado por Chávez controlaba cada dólar o moneda extranjera, pues así lo dispuso el presidente hasta su muerte. Justo cuando Venezuela manejó la mayor riqueza que haya tenido jamás, todo el mercado de divisas estuvo bajo un férreo control cambiario. Ahora, los venezolanos manejan más dólares que bolívares en medio de una dolarización de facto que se impuso a la fuerza debido a la escasez del papel moneda nacional y a la constante devaluación de estos billetes. Mientras el chavismo corea que el bolívar es la moneda, los dólares circulan rampantes por doquier. 6.- SANCIONES La animadversión de Chávez con el “imperio” norteamericano lo llevó a calificar al presidente George W. Bush de “diablo” y expulsar al embajador estadounidense en 2010. Esta enemistad no escaló más hasta que Maduro se hizo con el poder y, desde entonces, EE.UU. ha emitido más de 400 sanciones económicas, una política a la que se han sumado otros países americanos y europeos, lo que se ha traducido en un bloqueo comercial. 7.- LA OPOSICIÓN Las fuerzas políticas que se oponen a la revolución estaban, al menos en apariencia, más unidas que nunca cuando Chávez falleció. Ese hecho, en las primeras de cambio, las reanimó en sus propósitos de poner fin al poder chavista. Luego de derrotas electorales, reveses políticos y apuestas fallidas, la oposición venezolana está desmembrada, sin fuerza y sin propuesta, justo cuando la popularidad del Gobierno está en el suelo. 8.- LA AYUDA La Venezuela de Chávez ayudó con millones de dólares en el desarrollo de países desfavorecidos. La inagotable chequera de la industria petrolera disparó la popularidad del fallecido presidente conforme aumentaba la cooperación internacional. La Venezuela de Maduro requiere ayuda humanitaria urgente pues millones de ciudadanos tienen necesidades básicas insatisfechas. El país pasó de hacer donaciones millonarias a recibir la asistencia de Naciones Unidas para intentar saciar el hambre de una sociedad que vive su más acuciante crisis. EFE © El Sol News, LLC.

May 27, 2021 | Lauren Woods - Schools of Medicine and Dental Medicine A heartwarming Memorial Day story of an Army Veteran turned paramedic saving another Army Veteran's life from the most dangerous type of heart attack. Cardiac arrest and heart attack survivor James Whalen, 70, of Bristol served in the U.S. Army from 1969 to 1971 including in Vietnam (Photos courtesy of Whalen family). Army veteran James Whalen, 70, of Bristol is extra thankful this Memorial Day for his fellow veterans, especially Army Vet turned paramedic Taylor Gonzalez, 31, who helped save him from a life-threatening heart attack. On the morning of May 22, Whalen was once again placing American flags on the graves of fallen soldiers in advance of the Memorial Day holiday with his veteran friends. Whalen has annually performed this honor since 1971 after serving in Vietnam. He then headed to the pool for some afternoon exercise. “I got in the pool, and could tell I just didn’t have my usual energy,” reports Whalen who started to feel extremely short of breath post-swim. “I said to the lifeguard ‘I can’t breathe’ and the lifeguard team quickly called the ambulance,” recounts Whalen. “I suddenly passed out from my heart attack. When I woke up, all I remember is being put on a stretcher, and the EMT shouting ‘we’re going to UConn!’” Gonzalez, who served in the Army infantry including in Iraq and a Bristol EMS paramedic responding to Whalen’s cardiac arrest, recalls his shouting of the same message. “We headed to UConn because that’s the closest Cardiac Catheterization Lab best equipped to deal with and open up the type of serious STEMI heart attack blockage our 12-lead electrocardiogram on the scene showed Mr. Whalen was experiencing.” A STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) is the most life-threatening heart attack. It occurs when blood flow to a portion of the heart is completely blocked. Unless the blockage is removed quickly, the patient’s heart muscle begins to die, and their health and life are in serious danger. UConn Health’s Emergency Department and its Calhoun Cardiology Center are known for their fast and lifesaving care of heart attack patients, especially those experiencing STEMI. Gonzalez added: “In the middle of my care of Mr. Whalen, my colleague kept him talking. She asked him to tell us about himself. He replied ‘I’m a veteran’ and she informed him ‘Well the EMT working on you right now is a veteran too!’” “Saving the life of a fellow veteran was quite surreal,” says Gonzalez. “I never thought I would ever be doing that.” Gonzalez was inspired to enter the health care field and become an EMT/paramedic five years ago following his experience in Iraq. It was a team effort saving Whalen’s life. Lifeguards initially performed CPR and used a life-saving AED to shock Whalen’s unresponsive heart back to beating. But Whalen’s heart stopped again and EMS shocked him again to return his pulse. The Bristol EMS ambulance team, in addition to Gonzalez, was Rachel Guillemette, Boblee Bruce and Jessica Caccomo. From the pool the EMS crew radioed in advance UConn John Dempsey Hospital of the STEMI patient alert. Once Whalen arrived to Emergency Department the Cath Lab team was already activated and awaiting to open up his blocked heart arteries.

Orange-based energy company Avangrid Inc. is a step closer to completing its $8.3 billion merger with a New Mexico utilities operator that will significantly expand the company’s reach in the U.S. Shareholders of PNM Resources, which runs utilities in New Mexico and Texas, voted “overwhelmingly” in favor of the proposed merger, Avangrid announced in a news release. The deal gives shareholders $50.30 in cash for each share, putting the value of the merger at $8.3 billion. Avangrid, which is owned by Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, first announced the merger last October. “Approval by PNM’s shareholders is an important step toward realizing this strategic transaction,” Avangrid CEO Dennis V. Arriola said in a statement. “ Our two companies share the same values and we are passionate about our customers, employees and the communities we serve.” The company said it is still pursuing regulatory approvals from federal and state agencies. If all are received, the merger is expected to close sometime this year. The merger would add roughly 790,000 customers to Avangrid’s existing 3.3 million customer count in the Northeast. Avangrid said the combined company would be one of the major clean energy companies in the U.S., with 10 regulated utilities in six states. It also would be the nation’s third-largest renewable energy company with operations in 24 states.

Fall archery hunting season for deer and wild turkey goes to the end of December on private lands and state land bowhunting only areas, and to the end of January 2021 on private lands in Deer Management Zones 11 and 12. On state lands open to hunting, the archery season runs from September 15 to November 16 and from December 22 through the end of December. Archery deer hunting is allowed on private lands on Sundays in all Deer Management Zones. Wild turkeys CANNOT be hunted on Sunday anywhere in the state. “The outlook for the 2021 hunting season looks good as another mild winter and an in increase in deer observations occurred in most zones last year,” said Andy LaBonte, DEEP Wildlife Division Biologist. “The 2020 Connecticut Deer Program Summary contains information that will be helpful to hunters in the upcoming season.” The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more people participating in hunting and other outdoor activities over the past year, which potentially could create more hunter and non-hunter conflicts on heavily used state land areas. Although hunters are required to wear fluorescent orange while participating in many types of hunting activities, it is highly recommended that all state land users wear an article of fluorescent orange during the hunting season to maintain a safe outdoor environment for everyone. “On average, Connecticut experienced moderate acorn production in 2021,” said Michael Gregonis, DEEP Wildlife Division Biologist. “So, fall weather conditions could be an influential factor on both the deer and turkey harvest.” “The best hunting opportunities still exist in the southwest corner of the state and many of the shoreline towns, especially for bowhunters,” continued LaBonte. “Many landowners use the archery deer hunting season as a safe and effective means of reducing deer populations, especially in the more developed areas of the state where firearms hunting may not be feasible.” Resident Game Bird Conservation Stamp: A Resident Game Bird Conservation Stamp was established in 2016, which replaces all turkey permits and the Pheasant Stamp, and is required to hunt any resident (non-migratory) game birds, including wild turkey, pheasant, ruffed grouse, partridge, and quail. The cost of the Resident Game Bird Conservation Stamp is $28 for adult residents and non-residents and $14 for Connecticut hunters ages 12 through 17. All revenues from the sale of Resident Game Bird Conservation Stamps will be deposited into a separate, non-lapsing account to use exclusively for game birds and their habitat. Wild turkey hunters planning to hunt in fall 2021 will need a 2021 Resident Game Bird Conservation Stamp. Landowners (who own 10 or more contiguous acres) may take turkeys on their property with the Free Landowner Resident Game Bird Conservation Stamp or Resident Game Bird Conservation Stamp. There is no additional bag limit for turkeys due to the Free Landowner Game Bird Conservation Stamp. Report Harvest: Hunters are required to report their deer and turkey harvest within 24 hours either on the DEEP website here or by calling a toll free number (1-877-337-4868). Deer hunters in Deer Management Zones 11 and 12 who take advantage of the Replacement Antlerless and Earn-a-Buck tag programs must complete this same tagging and reporting procedure prior to going to a check station that issues replacement tags. A listing of replacement tag vendors is available on the DEEP website. After reporting their harvest via the Internet or by telephone, hunters will be given a confirmation number to write on their Harvest Tag. This confirmation number serves as proof that the harvest was legally reported. Wear Fluorescent Orange: Bowhunters are reminded that they must wear 400 square inches of fluorescent orange while walking to and from their tree stands during the firearms deer hunting season. However, once in a tree stand, elevated at least 10 feet off the ground, bowhunters may remove the fluorescent orange clothing. All private land archery hunters are required to carry a DEEP consent form signed by the landowner and dated for the current season. Consent forms can be found in the Hunting Guide or here. Deer permits and Resident Game Bird Conservation Stamps can be purchased online at here or at participating town halls and vendors. Hunters should consult the DEEP website for an up-to-date listing of new state lands open to archery hunting.

I was telling someone new this little factoid, just saying “I just got into it” and my friend, one of the co-managing editors of The Mirror, Tobenna Ugwu, unhelpfully jumped in with “It’s literally been a few weeks. She went on one lunch and now has tickets to things.” This, of course, is a slight exaggeration, but I did just recently discover the wonderful world of drag and drag queens. In just a month, I’ve seen nearly all the seasons of “Ru Paul’s Drag Race” in both the United States, the United Kingdom and all of the All-Stars seasons. I have tickets to a drag show on Halloween weekend and another show in April of 2022. I bought gold fabric and gold gogo boots for my slightly heretic Halloween costume, completely inspired by drag. I am just one of those slightly obsessive personalities who get really into things quickly, and by the time you finish blinking, I’m on a plane to “Drag Queen School” in Sweden or have purchased multiple wigs at 4:00 a.m. But… I think it’s where I get a lot of my charm (at least I hope?). No matter! But, what I didn’t expect in my newfound interest, is this profound understanding of what drag queens truly teach us. Trying to avoid corniness and my friends rolling their eyes, drag queens teach us to have overwhelming self-confidence and a true sense of self. As a senior at Fairfield University, I know how hard it is to truly find yourself here. Fairfield touts the Jesuit values and claims that your four years here will develop you as a whole person, that you’ll graduate and truly know who you are. But, the typical fear of missing out runs deep through the University. What makes people unique and what makes them special is hidden under layers of insecurities and a worry that their friend group will judge them. I’m not saying I’m always able to rise above this feeling. I lived in Loyola Hall sophomore year and my roommate and I would watch the flood of kids run through the track on their way back from the townhouses. We’d sit and tell ourselves we’ll go next week because it’s the “typical college experience.” It didn’t matter that we both hated townhouse parties and would rather take a very long walk off a very short cliff than stand in a townhouse basement packed like sardines. There’s just something about watching other people “have fun” around you that makes you feel like you’re missing something. The endless scroll through dark snap stories with pounding EDM, as you lay in bed making you feel like you’re doing this whole college thing wrong; that there might be something wrong with you. But, there comes a time in your life where you grow out of this feeling, or at least I did. When that true deep, “I hate townhouse parties” actually overwhelmed my FOMO and I was able to start doing things I actually liked without fear of being judged by my peers. Like going to a production of Rocky Horror Picture show in full costume, or the Milford Apple Festival or drinking an entire box of Sunset Blush Franzia with my roommates. I think it takes a lot of work to truly discover who you are and discover that you aren’t less of a person or less cool than all the “popular girls” at school. But, what always stops me from thinking “Oh, if I ask someone to go to the Apple Festival with me, will they think I’m weird?” or “What if someone sees me in the parking lot listening to Rain on Me?” is the thought of those darn drag queens. I think that if grown men can tuck their business, put a dress and a wig on to dance in front of a room of 400 people, we can all discover who we truly are. We can have the confidence to text someone to go get lunch with us at a random spot downtown. We can dance the craziest, be the loudest laugh in a room, and truly grow into fabulously unique individuals we are, without fear of being judged. This is where we can truly look to drag queens.

La estrella de las redes sociales dice que su barba nunca ha sido un problema para su empleador, porque trabaja en un entorno «corporativo extremadamente profesional» . “La gente siempre es respetuosa, incluso cuando fui a mis entrevistas hace varios años, nadie mencionó mi vello facial y el respeto nunca ha sido un problema”, afirmó. Sin embargo, no todos los usuarios de TikTok son tan amables. Pero @PeekabooPumpkin no se deja intimidar, continúa subiendo clips y ganando dinero en OnlyFans de los seguidores que adoran su barba. © El Sol News, LLC. All rights reserved.'}]"

they both feel strongly about. Sometimes they disagree; other times, they’re in perfect harmony. Here, Arts & Culture Editor Oscar Kim Bauman and News Editor Jem Shin discuss “Eternals,” the latest entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, directed by Chloé Zhao. In “Eternals,” a group of superpowered immortals called the Eternals are sent to Earth to protect humanity from a race of creatures known as Deviants. After watching over Earth for millennia, the Eternals split up centuries ago, thinking their mission was complete. In the present day, they reunite when they realize the Deviants have returned and an even greater threat may be present. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity, and contains spoilers for “Eternals.” Oscar Kim Bauman: We just got out of “Eternals.” I’d say I think I’m still processing it. It was a weird movie. Jem Shin: It was long. OKB: It is two hours and 37 minutes long, which is the longest Marvel movie besides “Avengers: Endgame.” And I’d say it felt long. JS: I agree. There was a lot of plot. OKB: One thing that I did appreciate was the incredibly diverse cast. Although I think it is a little weird that the first movie to have all this representation is the one where the characters aren’t actually people. They’re aliens. So the Eternals are immortal space-people with powers. They all have different powers. Their mission is to protect humans from the Deviants. And they thought the Deviants were gone, but they’re back. I’d say the main thrust of the movie is getting the gang back together. Because the Eternals broke up a long time ago, after the massacre of the Aztecs by the Spanish conquistadors at Tenochtitlan in 1521. JS: Druig, played by Barry Keoghan, takes issue with the fact that all the Eternals are standing there watching that genocide happen. And so he takes it up with their leader, Ajak, played by Salma Hayek, and [uses his powers to] control the minds of the conquistadors to make them stop murdering the Aztecs. OKB: This is sort of the thing people ask when you have these powerful, immortal characters: Why didn’t they stop genocides? The answer this movie gives us is that some of them wanted to, but the rest of them didn’t. This can bring us into the characters. Brian Tyree Henry plays Phastos, who has been getting press for being the first openly gay character in a Marvel movie. Phastos’ powers are that he’s the technology guy. He creates devices and wants to help humans advance. There is this jarring scene where it just cuts to a mushroom cloud and the on-screen text goes, “Hiroshima, August 1945,” and Phastos is sitting in the wreckage, upset because the humans have used his technology for this. Inserting superheroes into this feels weird. JS: It was very much saying that he started the seed of technological progress and then the humans ran with that and eventually developed the atomic bomb, and then he watched it happen. OKB: I want to give credit for addressing where these immortal beings were during all these huge historical events, but it just has all these horrible implications. What were the Eternals doing during the Holocaust? Were there Eternals watching sadly on 9/11? It brings in all these questions that are the exact opposite of what you want to see in a movie about space people in colorful costumes. To our beloved Argus readers: I’m sorry if you’re having trouble following this. We did too. JS: That’s the real issue. There’s just so much lore to understand. OKB: I thought it was very strange. I’m going to say it’s not the worst Marvel movie because it’s at least trying to do something interesting. I think it could have been a half-hour shorter and used another rewrite, though. Its low Rotten Tomatoes score is getting a lot of attention. I think that score is deserved, but maybe other Marvel movies deserve lower. JS: I agree that the Rotten Tomatoes score is correct. I like when Marvel movies are fun and enjoyable to sit through and not just lots of comic things coming to life. They’re superhero movies for a reason, to be enjoyed by a general audience, and the minimum amount of this was enjoyable. OKB: The strongest part of this was the performances. I really liked Gemma Chan as Sersi and Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo. Those are fun performances and I like those characters, but in terms of the overall plot, it gets pretty messy because it’s trying to do a lot. I was not anticipating that Gemma Chan’s character, Sersi, was our main character. I had no idea who the main character was going to be going into this because there are 10 Eternals. Ten is too many characters to introduce to us and I feel like I got to know a solid six of them. JS: Yeah. I did not remember all of their names, but I knew the general traits that were assigned to them. I knew who was supposed to be strong and who was the movie star and who was the love interest. I thought Kit Harington was going to have a bigger role. He’s just a human named Dane. OKB: What other characters have we not mentioned? There’s so many of them. Oh, there’s Lauren Ridloff, who plays Makkari. JS: So Makkari’s deal is that she is fast, very fast, and is deaf. OKB: I wish there was more to say. She uses sign language, which is a cool thing to see in a big movie like this. She has cool scenes of her being fast and saving people. But I feel like there’s not a lot more to her character. Although that’s more development than Don Lee gets as Gilgamesh, whose thing is just that he is strong. JS: All the performances were doing the most that they could with the script and story that they were given. OKB: I thought Richard Madden was not very good as Ikaris. JS: Ikaris is not a good character. I think that’s why Richard Madden doesn’t come off very well. OKB: There’s not a lot for Ikaris to do. He’s a very serious square-jawed guy. He’s basically Superman. He can fly and he has laser beams from his eyes. JS: And he’s in love with Gemma Chan. This is the key point of the movie. OKB: A lot of Richard Madden’s scenes were him with a straight face staring into the distance. JS: The accent is good though. I like that he kept his natural accent. OKB: I think a lot of the attention “Eternals” is getting is that it was directed by Chloé Zhao who just won Best Director and Best Picture last year for “Nomadland” (2020). I think they’re very different movies, but I have the same opinion of “Nomadland” as I have of “Eternals.” They are both movies that are trying to do a lot and it doesn’t really land for me. JS: I think that’s a very good summary. I agree about “Nomadland,” and I think it’s so funny that some people have reviewed “Eternals” and they say they can see the influences of “Nomadland” in this movie, because I don’t want that in a Marvel movie. OKB: Also, people are talking about this as if it was Chloé Zhao’s project after “Nomadland” when “Nomadland” was fully filmed after “Eternals.” They’ve just postponed it because, you know, pandemic. Does the influence show? There’s a few scenes where they’re standing on a beach or in a field and there’s some nice natural light. JS: Lots of landscape shots. OKB: Also, Ajak rides a horse in one shot. [Zhao] likes the wide expanse of the American West. But as weird as it is, I feel the same way coming out of “Nomadland” that I do coming out of “Eternals.” When I watched “Nomadland,” I was like, “Wait, what, what did I miss?
