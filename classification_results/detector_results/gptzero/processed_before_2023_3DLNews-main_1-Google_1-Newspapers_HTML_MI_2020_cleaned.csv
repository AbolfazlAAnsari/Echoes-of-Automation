An angler catching a tagged fish Feb. 15 on Harmon Lake wins money – and possibly the $25,000 grand prize offered for the contest’s 25th anniversary. Seldom can you can toss a line in a Tuscola County lake and catch a fish worth $25,000. But that could happen Feb. 15 for some lucky angler on Harmon Lake northeast of Mayville, where the Fowler Center for Outdoor Learning offers that cash prize for that one fish during its 25th annual ice-fishing contest. “We’re the only people hoping for colder temperatures,” said Lynn Seeloff, assistant director at the Fowler Center for Outdoor Learning, 2315 Harmon Lake Road, where organizers wish for thick ice by contest time. “Everyone else tells us how much they enjoy the mild winter, but we say, ‘We really need it to be cold.’” Workers place 10 tagged pike and 15 tagged rainbow trout into the lake in the days before the contest. By catching a tagged fish, an angler wins at least $100 and could win the $25,000 grand prize if the number on the tag matches the number inside the grand-prize envelope opened following the contest. “There are other cash prizes for the most number of species caught that day, the longest pike, the oldest angler, the youngest angler with a fish, (categories) like that,” said Seeloff, noting an angler must be at least 18 to win the $25,000 grand prize. The Feb. 15 event also features various raffles, and it’s a fundraiser for the Fowler Center, which offers year-round outdoor and camping experiences for children and adults with disabilities. Anglers must pre-register for the ice-fishing contest by visiting thefowlercenter.org. An angler pays $40 to register, giving him/her all-day access to fish in the morning session from 7:30-11 a.m., and in the afternoon session from 1-5:30 p.m. Anglers cannot pay to enter the contest on the day of the event. Only the first five fish caught, and presented to the tournament director, qualify for the chance to win the grand prize. The Fowler Center serves chicken dinner from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. for $10 per person. As Michigan’s “Free Fishing Weekend” is Feb. 15-16, there’s no need to buy a fishing license prior to competing in the ice-fishing contest. “On the day of the event, though, (anglers) have to bring cash – if they want to buy tickets for the 50/50 raffle, or try to win one of the raffle packages or concessions,” Seeloff said. “Workers don’t accept credit cards or debit cards at the lake. “A couple of our prize packages are a Zehnder’s Splash Village package and an auto-care package, but we have lots of different prizes.” Seeloff and Stacy Windham are co-chairwomen of the contest. Seeloff said Windham, the Fowler Center for Outdoor Learning’s accounts payable clerk, “has been helping us out a lot and has done a lot with increasing the sponsorship of the event.” All participants must pre-register before 5 p.m. Feb. 12. Those wishing to spend Friday night, Feb. 14, at the Fowler Center can do so by paying $15 per person for a spot in a heated cabin with a shared bathroom. “They’d have to bring their own (bed) linens, because they just receive a bed,” Seeloff said. Last year’s top prize in the ice-fishing contest was $7,000. Anyone buying a $40 ticket for the contest receives a T-shirt commemorating the 25th anniversary of the ice-fishing contest, which occurs provided there’s enough ice on Harmon Lake that day. “We can’t move the event, unfortunately, because we have to get lots of volunteers for that day,” Seeloff said. “We already have our other respite program, and groups booked in for after (Feb. 15). If there’s not ice, we’ll just have to cancel it. “But we don’t cancel it until right before the event, because we want to give it every chance to happen.” For more details, call 989-673-2050 or send email to info@thefowlercenter.org.

Clarkston News Sports Writer Gridiron heroes are scheduled to open the fall season against Pinckney in the fifth annual Battle at the Big House, Aug. 27. Amid the coronavirus pandemic and Governor Gretchen Whitmer extending the stay-at-home order to June 12, coaches and players are preparing to have a season. “We are proceeding like we are going to have a season,” said Kurt Richardson, longtime head coach for Clarkston Varsity Football last week. “Right now, the status is a go status until someone tells us differently.” “We have a glimmer of hope for the fall,” added Clarkston Athletic Director Jeff Kosin. “The MHSAA (Michigan High School Athletic Association) made a statement fall sports are a go. However, it can all change with the governor’s final say.” Richardson added he hopes athletes have been staying active and in shape on their own. “I want the kids active,” he said, adding the cancellation of the spring season will make an impact. “I want them playing. I am big on them playing other sports anyway,” Richardson added. “I think there are lessons to be learned playing other sports and also skill development playing other sports. It hurts a little bit. For the track kids, that’s a whole spring they would have been getting faster. The lacrosse kids, they should be doing all those things. Those skills transfer over to us so if they are just sitting on the couch then those skills aren’t being developed.” Another impact on athletics is Clarkston Community Education last week cancelling all the camps for the summer. Some of the camps include those for football, volleyball, basketball, baseball, softball and lacrosse. “It puts us in a little bit of a pickle,” Kosin said. “You look at our Wolves Football Camp with Coach KR and Fife Camp, those are things our kids would be participating in and they are no longer available to our kids this summer. There are some good, and then there’s that when you take a step in the opposite direction.” The MHSAA put new rules in place during the annual Spring Meeting of the Representative Council, May 4. One of the changes includes athletes could participate in five quarters a week in football and basketball. For football, it could move junior varsity games to Saturday. If varsity players didn’t play in the game on Friday, they would be eligible to play in a JV game. Richardson added it helps the smaller schools which may not have enough players for each level. He explained Clarkston has a good amount of players on each level. “I don’t want to take away from the kids who didn’t play on Friday and send them down to JV on Saturday morning to play JV and take up the JV kids’ time,” he explained. “I just want to let the JV kids play JV and the varsity kids play varsity.” More changes include getting rid of the dead week. “They came out and said it is an individual school can make the decision to lift the dead period this year,” Kosin said. “If indeed we do go back, we can take the choice of saying we’re not going to have a dead period and that kids will be able to participate year round. There are things they have put in place to have you believe there is going to be a fall, but no one really knows to be honest with you.” Another change is the number of 7-on-7 competition. The council approved a committee recommendation allowing schools 15 summer dates of non-mandatory contact with an unlimited number of players with “schools may use these dates as they see fit, but of these 15 only seven dates may be used for 7-on-7 competition against other teams. This also eliminates the previous allowance for a camp.” Kosin added 7-on-7 competitions are booked for Tuesdays and if the only ten allowed in a grouping continues, they can do 5-on-5. “There’s your ten,” Kosin said. “You have your quarterback and only four receivers and on defense five linebackers, or whatever you need. If the ten rule still applies, there are ways to do it.” He noted that the MHSAA is meeting again in June. “There is a lot of unknown,” Kosin said, adding there are a lot of variables. “When you look at fall sports, girls golf should play, boys tennis should play. Is it every kid has their own ball and no one is touching if the ball goes out of bounds and you have a spectator with gloves on throwing it back to the kid? Does every kid have their own ball they put in their pocket and that’s it? You aren’t exchanging ball after ball.” He added, he thinks about an indoor sport like volleyball where it could be a problem. “A lot will depend on what colleges choose to do, too,” he said. “If NCAA lifts that, high school sports might follow, but you don’t know. You hear all sorts of conversations. “It is a very unprecedented time,” Kosin added. “I don’t know what this is going to do to athletics. You look at our seventh and eighth grade football, are parents going to want their kids out? Are we going to have to go back to one team for seventh grade and one team for eighth grade? Concussions really dropped our sports, is this going to take away from sports as well? Are parents going to be leery of having kids participate?

Unique Weapons for Non-violent Students In addition to the typical traits that come along with youthfulness such as idealism and impatience, student success during the 1960 sit-ins and thereafter was directly affixed to two distinct assets possessed by students juxtaposed to their older adult activist counterparts.The first asset is condense demographics, as student-body populations were primarily located on campuses and/or nearby the colleges. The fact that hundreds to thousands of students in a college town lived within a square mile of each other led to the expeditious mobilization of large numbers of people and efficient dissemination of information and strategy. Although black churches proved to be invaluable throughout the Black Freedom Struggle from Reconstruction to the Civil Rights Movement, there was still no equivalent amongst the older black generation to the college campus\' effectiveness as both a meeting place and as a domicile for housing and dispersing the shock troops of the movement. The second major asset specific to students would be the relation between arrest and reprisal.At some of their demonstrations prior to 1960, older black activists strategically triggered their arrests for charges such as trespassing or loitering as a way to dramatize unjust treatment via media coverage and to pressure white officials to change discriminatory laws. Once mobilized per the sit-ins however, student activists were able to invite and withstand incarceration for far longer periods of time and in extremely larger numbers. Students vastly elevated this critical strategy of the overall movement.During 1960 and beyond, the enormous numbers unleashed by black student activists put unyielding pressure on local law enforcement, political officials and jail facilities.In many cities like Greensboro, there were not enough jail cells for all of the students arrested, particularly since the students refused bail and chose to remain incarcerated. This action severely drained local municipalities of money and resources, forcing local governmental, business and law officials to dramatically adjust policies and sometimes change discriminatory laws.Student activists were able to perfect this strategy because they could endure prolonged imprisonment without fear of major job or housing reprisal. Comparably, many older activists, whose families depended on their incomes, could not sacrifice prolonged periods of incarceration, as it would threaten their livelihood.Furthermore, angry employers or landlords, who disapproved of their protest activities, could threaten to fire them or abruptly remove them from property they were renting. Students were not confronted with the same ramifications of these economic, employment and housing reprisals, as the majority of them lived on campuses and perhaps had part-time, albeit replaceable, minimum wage jobs, often with no dependents. Drawing the contrast between student activists versus the older activists is not synonymous with drawing divisions, as the older activists understood the assets that students solely possessed to further the movement along.In fact, many of the older activists encouraged the younger activists and actively supported them in numerous ways. For example, when Bennett College students, who were the heroines on the 1963 Greensboro protests, were arrested and refused bail during the 1963 sit-ins in Greensboro, their professors came to the jail facilities and gave them their classroom and homework assignments every week.This scenario personifies the symbiotic relationship between both generations in the fight against racism, as the professors showed their appreciation for the young people\'s unique and valiant position for the benefit of the entire race and future generations, yet not removing the students from their responsibilities and academic requirements. Altogether, students endured countless hardships that included incarceration, verbal assaults and physical violence. Sometimes, attacks from white antagonists were compounded by disproportionate responses from law enforcement, as Portsmouth activist, Edward Rodman explained, ""...the fire department, all of the police force and police dogs were mobilized. The police turned the dogs loose on the Negroes-but not all the whites."" Students also understood that they could pay the ultimate price for protesting against the status quo of racial inequality, as numerous activists were murdered throughout the Civil Rights era. Nevertheless, over 50,000 black students and sympathizers participated in the sit-ins of 1960.As historian Clayborne Carson highlighted, ""Nonviolent tactics, particularly when accompanied by rationale based on Christian principles, offered black students...a sense of moral superiority, an emotional release through militancy, and a possibility of achieving desegregation."" A movement within a movement was born on February 1, 1960 and that movement evolved into its own distinct force by the middle of the decade. Soon after the sit-ins began, students realized their collective prowess, as student activism consistently helped define the decade of the 60s in forcing monumental political, legal and social changes throughout the nation. Finally, the black student activists of the 1960 sit-ins did three important things, albeit unintentional: they helped lay the foundation for all collective student activism in the 60s and beyond, they played a legendary role in the larger African-American Freedom Movement that began as early as Africans\' arrival to colonial America, and they cemented a valuable place in one of America\'s most significant traditions, the protest tradition, which has continuously defined and propelled our country since its inception. Our society, and all post-1960 social movements, have undeniably benefited from the audacity of those four brave freshmen and their actions on February 1, 1960. P.O.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:46 pm CADILLAC — Ryan Kleeman knew his 4-year-old son, Jayce, would be curious to learn about his father, which is why he wrote some things down for him to read when he got older. He wrote about his addiction, he wrote about his triggers, and he wrote about how he dealt with his demons over the years. Sadly, Ryan never had the opportunity to show his son the letters himself — he passed away from a drug overdose on Sunday, Sept. 29, 2019. He was 35. Ryan left behind Jayce’s mother and his fiancee, Tina Richardson, along with her 10-year-old son, Izaiah. Tina said she met Ryan a little over a decade ago and they developed a close friendship before becoming romantically involved. “He was fearless,‘ Tina said, her voice cracking with emotion. “He was always super romantic and spontaneous. No matter what he was going through personally, he always put his family first.‘ Ryan’s obituary describes him as someone who “easily made friends anywhere he went due to his vibrant, witty, kindhearted, goofy personality which gained him a few well-known nicknames such as ‘Ryno’ and ‘Kleemo.’‘ But underneath the happy-go-lucky exterior, Ryan was fighting a constant battle. Throughout the course of their relationship, Tina said Ryan struggled with alcoholism and bouts of drug addiction. She said he started off drinking and using pills and other drugs recreationally. Eventually, this turned into heroin and meth use. She said it was obvious to her when Ryan was using drugs and when he was clean. “I could tell in his facial features and mannerisms,‘ Tina said. “He would become more distant.‘ Tina said Ryan also suffered from persistent feelings of guilt and depression. She thinks some of these feelings stemmed from the loss of his mother in his early 20s. A little over three years ago, after walking away from an intervention set up by the family to confront him about his drug abuse, Ryan decided to seek help. He stayed clean — with the exception of alcohol — until his most recent relapse. The last time he relapsed, however, the slide into addiction was deeper and for a longer period than it usually took for Ryan to seek help. “I saw a downward spiral coming,‘ Tina said. “But it was too late to do anything about.‘ Tina said Ryan knew he had a problem but was ashamed to admit it and didn’t know how to talk about it with her or anyone else. “I begged him to tell me the truth,‘ Tina said. “I told him, ‘I can’t help you if you don’t tell me.’ He hated being on that path but he had a hard time talking about his feelings. He hated that he just couldn’t be normal and not feel the need to use.‘ Ryan’s older brother, Billy Wood, described Ryan as a “super fun guy‘ who “loved everybody and would do anything for you.‘ Billy said Ryan lived with him for a little while several years ago and he remembers catching him snorting crushed up OxyContin in his room. At the time, Billy said the discovery didn’t seem like addiction and more like party behavior, although when he started traveling for construction work, it became clear his brother’s substance abuse problem had a firm grasp on him. Billy said he tried in vain to talk to Ryan about the deadly seriousness of hard drug use — particularly heroin. “I said, ‘that (stuff) will kill you,’‘ Billy said. “I realized that I couldn’t help Ryan directly with his addiction, so I decided to focus on helping his family. I don’t know what I could have done to help him, besides maybe dragging him to rehab again. (I had to) come to terms with the fact that he might not be around long term if he continued his downward spiral.‘ Despite his addiction to heroin, Billy said Ryan did not have a death wish. The night he overdosed, he was using fentanyl, which is far more potent than heroin. “It was a fluke,‘ Billy said. “He didn’t know it was fentanyl.‘ Wexford County Prosecutor Jason Elmore said at 1 a.m. on Sept. 29, a 911 call reported a man laying outside. He said Cadillac Police responded and found Ryan outside of a home suffering from an overdose. The responding officers performed CPR on Ryan in an effort to save his life. Elmore said when EMS arrived they took over CPR and transported Ryan to Munson Healthcare Cadillac Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Tina said she first heard about Ryan’s death on Facebook, where she read a post saying that EMS were on their way to treat an unresponsive man in a part of town she knew Ryan was hanging around lately. She soon received a call from a Cadillac police officer, who told her she needed to get to the scene right away. Although she knew that she might receive this call at some point, given Ryan’s lifestyle, Tina admits that she didn’t see it coming. One of the first emotions she had was anger that someone didn’t call 911 faster. If they did, Ryan might still be alive. “Everything changed,‘ Tina said regarding how her family has been affected by Ryan’s passing. “It was my son waking up and not having his father. Nothing we do as a family feels the same. There is a very big void everywhere we go, everyone we see. We take it day by day, some days, hour by hour ... then it hits me — a million things.‘ Tina said sometimes Jayce asks her to play songs that remind him of Ryan, which can be very emotional for her but she does it anyway because it is helping him deal with the loss of his father. “I think it actually does him good,‘ Tina said. Jayce also doesn’t like it when Tina leaves him to hang out with friends because that’s what his father was doing when he died. Her older son, Izaiah, has a better understanding about what happened to Ryan, although she said he doesn’t like talking about it. “He thinks talking about it will upset everybody,‘ Tina said. “We’ve both been talking to counselors.‘ Derrick Smith, a friend of Billy and outreach worker with Harm Reduction Michigan, said one of the saddest things about this and many other situations like it is that it could have been prevented if someone in the home had naloxone — the drug that reverses overdoses. Harm Reduction Michigan is a nonprofit group that provides Narcan, clean syringes and other resources to those struggling with addiction. It is run by medical professionals and recovering addicts, among them Smith. “We don’t have any agenda besides helping people,‘ said Smith, who added that there are many people who don’t feel comfortable going into a government building to ask for naloxone, whereas they may feel more at ease visiting a Harm Reduction Michigan office. Smith said with how little it costs to obtain naloxone, there is no reason why someone can’t come into an office and get 10 kits, no questions asked. The objective of Harm Reduction Michigan is just as its name implies, to reduce further harm, death and disease due to drug use. “In a lot of cases, they’ve had bad experiences seeking help in other places, and that builds a level of apathy,‘ Smith said. “Our philosophy is to present zero barriers of entry. How can we help?‘ While still in the works at this point, Smith said they are in the process of opening up a Harm Reduction Michigan office here in Cadillac.

The resolution was originally given to the county for approval by members of a group, which is working to get the resolution passed in every one of Michigan’s 83 counties. In addition to declaring the county a sanctuary county, the resolution stated that “this board affirms its support for the Iosco County Sheriff and Iosco County Prosecuting Attorney, in the exercise of their sound discretion to not enforce against any citizen an unconstitutional law.” Before the vote, commissioners listened to a number of public comments from individuals in the packed Board of Commissioners conference room, where there was standing room only. Many of those in attendance were not residents of the county, but individuals traveling around the state to attend various board of commissioners meetings to show support for the movement. Chairman Robert Huebel opened the meeting asking if there were spokespeople willing to talk for the group. One who spoke was Burleigh Township resident David Chandler. Chandler, who has previously run for a state representative seat, said he was thankful and hopeful that the county would approve the second amendment resolution. “I think its a really great thing,” he said. “I think as you can see we are all here in support of it, and this is our county and we cannot allow other powers to dictate how we run things here.

We elected you to represent us, not to be some state agency, and I applaud you.” Earl Lackie, who is running for the 5th Congressional District in Michigan, said he is working with committees pushing the Second Amendment resolutions. Lackie, who resides in Flint, said he had a law enforcement background. He said guns are important in society and that he learned about them from a young age. He said gun violence issues, like mass shootings, are not caused by guns but by lapses in mental health. “I applaud you for going with us 100 percent here, one of the things that the police do not want to hear are shots fired,” he said. “As (lawmakers) try to pass these red flag laws, we have lost lives because of some of these laws.” Lackie is referencing the so-called “red flag laws” that have been enacted at least 17 states that were created by lawmakers who said they were put in place to protect the public from mass shootings and other gun violence. As reported by the New York Times, red flag laws are “state laws that authorize courts to issue a special type of protection order, allowing the police to temporarily confiscate firearms from people who are deemed by a judge to be a danger to themselves or to others.” These requests can come from concerned relatives, friends or even law enforcement about individuals who “owns one or more guns and has expressed suicidal thoughts or discussed shooting people.” Before the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School Shooting in, Parkland, Fla., only a handful of states had enacted red flag laws. In that shooting, 17 individuals, including students and teachers, were massacred (with 17 more individuals suffering gunshot wounds and other injuries). The shooter, who faces 17 capital murder charges, was continually reported to the police as a public danger before the incident. Many in the Second Amendment movement, however, have said the laws are unconstitutional and go too far. When asked by resident Ken Demar what the county would do in an event a perceived unconstitutional law was enacted concerning gun laws, Huebel said residents could expect the sheriff department to stand behind them. Iosco County Sheriff Allan MacGregor said he would uphold the constitution. “I’m a gun advocate,” he said. “If someone takes your guns that’s up to you, but it won’t be us.” Huebel told the group that he has been hunting and enjoying the use of firearms with his children for many years, including training them on their safe use. “I take pride in that fact so I’m fully on board with what this is saying,” he said. Vice Chairman Jay O’Farrell said there has been a lot of response from various commissioners in the state wanting to get on board with the resolution. I sit on a lot of committees and it’s unbelievable the commissioners in other counties that want a copy of this, but this will be sent to the governor, all the state legislators, that represent us,” he said. “The word is going to be getting out fast; this is a document that has lasted over 200 years, and it ain’t no time to change it.” Iosco County may be the latest county to join the list in Michigan, with eight counties passing 2nd Amendment resolutions, and four townships following suit, but not all counties are on board. As reported in The Alpena News, Alcona County struck the word “sanctuary” from its resolution, which expressed support of the second amendment, much to the dismay of supporters. Also reported in that publication, Alpena County voted to postpone the resolution. Commissioner Terry Dutcher said that most of the state’s counties are facing the resolution, and most are on board. “One county felt that it undermined the authority of the sheriff and prosecuting attorney, but ours does not do that,” he said. “It states specifically it doesn’t enforce any outside laws that would force them to adopt the second amendment.” After discussion, Dutcher cast a motion to approve the resolution and was seconded by Commissioner John Moehring. The motion passed unanimously. The Oscoda Press mobile app brings you the latest local breaking news, updates, and more. Read the Oscoda Press on your mobile device just as it appears in print.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 5:40 pm Reporter NORTHPORT — Northport voters cleared the way last week for Leelanau County’s first recreational marijuana dispensary by saying “no” to the repeal of its Recreational Marijuana Establishments Ordinance, known as Ordinance 125. After being on hold for several months pending results of the election, Leelanau Township resident Daniel Caudill is in the process of laying out a construction timeline for the dispensary he will name after Olean’s Liquor Store in Northport, N.Y., which opened following the repeal of prohibition. The business will look like a barn so it blends into the area, Caudill said. It will have an atmosphere of an old-time apothecary, rather than looking like other cannabis businesses that have cropped up around the Grand Traverse region, he said. “I want to be a part of the Leelanau and Northport business landscape,” Caudill said. “I want to be able to have something for Northport that is a great destination, that is in keeping with Northport and that the people of Northport can be proud of.” The ballot proposal, which would have replaced Ordinance 125 with one that that prohibits adult-use establishments in the village, failed on a vote of 252 to 175. Ordinance 125 was approved by the Northport Village Council a little more than a year ago. It allows for two dispensaries, one transporter, one safety tester and one processor in its development district, which is zoned for a mix of residential housing and low impact businesses. “The vote was a welcome validation of the action taken by the council in 2019,” said council member Will Harper, who has supported marijuana sales in the village. “Now we can move forward with Mr. Caudill’s business project, which will be a great addition to the village.” A special use permit and a site plan for the business that will be located at 800 Mill St. were both approved earlier this year by the Northport Planning Commission. The repeal and replace question was put on the November ballot after petition signatures were submitted earlier this year via a citizens referendum, which is allowed by the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act approved by state voters in 2018. Citizens formed a group called Citizens Against Weed Shops to oppose Ordinance 125. According to the state marijuana act, municipalities were required to opt out of allowing recreational or adult-use marijuana dispensaries and other related businesses if they didn’t want them. They could also opt in to allow medical marijuana businesses, which Northport did. Traverse City has several businesses that sell medical marijuana, many of which also want to be licensed to sell adult-use marijuana. After a long drafting process the city recently came out with regulations that allow for four recreational-based businesses in the city. The city is now facing several lawsuits over licensing regulations cannabis retailers say are too restrictive. Caudill was pre-qualified by the state — the first step in the licensing process — and will now need to apply for a license from the state, which costs $6,000, and from the village at a cost of $500. Both fees are non-refundable. A designer, Caudill has worked on branding for other dispensaries in the state. He built a home in the township several years ago and has been a permanent resident since January. He recently sold the home and purchased a historic wood cabin north of Woolsey Airport. Caudill said he has spoken with a lot of people who are nervous about bringing this type of business to Northport. “The thing I always say is, ‘Let me walk you through the plans.’ Once you do that they’re like, ‘Oh, that isn’t what I thought it was.’” Caudill plans to apply for a delivery license and has said 30 percent of his business will be through online sales and delivery, though that may be even higher because of the pandemic, he said. He said many people will continue to buy marijuana the way they always have. “This is a different type of customer and a different experience,” he said.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Recreational marijuana shops have only just started opening up around Michigan in recent months, most of them downstate.But near to Traverse City, two recreational pot businesses have opened their doors, both of them in Benzie County: Great Lakes Natural Remedies Inc., in Benzonia, and Lume, in Honor.But just as these pioneers got up and running, they had to face the same kind of existential threat looming over all businesses in this time of Coronavirus.(Of course, they happen to sell a product that’s proving popular in these uncertain times: A sales rep at Lume said last week Wednesday that the store had completely sold out of recreational edible products — apparently something a lot of people wanted to stock up on as they face indefinite sheltering in place.)That same day, Northern Express chatted over the phone with the president and COO of Lume, Doug Hellyar, about how the company is adapting and what he expects for the near future. Northern Express: How has this crisis impacted your industry so far? Doug Hellyar: Well, I can really just comment on how it’s impacted Lume, but my guess is the rest of the industry is probably having a similar experience. Actually, business is robust. We’ve had consistent sales at all of our six locations where we’re operational. We’ve been operating the same hours. The state — the Michigan Marijuana Regulatory Agency — has been very proactive, and they’re taking action to help us promote in-store pickup, home delivery, and curbside pickup. And at Lume, we’re offering a 10 percent discount for delivery, for customers that are picking up curbside, or for express checkout in store. Express: What’s the rationale for that? Hellyar: We just want to provide an economic incentive for patients and adult-use customers to have access to the product while minimizing human contact. Express: That makes sense. What measures have you taken in the stores to make them safer places? Hellyar: We have a full list of preventive procedures that we’ve implemented in response to the Covid-19 virus. All of those are listed on our website. Some of the highlights include — we’ve increased efforts to maintain the cleanliness of our stores, including developing a regular schedule for disinfecting all surfaces in our stores; all of our associates are required to wear gloves when servicing customers, and that includes in-store interaction, curbside pickup, as well as home delivery; and customers are no longer allowed to pick up the containers that hold our flower samples in store. They like to be able to see the product up close, they like to smell the product, but for obvious reasons, we’ve discontinued that practice. In certain locations where we have smaller floorspace in-store, we’re limiting the number of customers that we have in both the waiting room and on the sales floor. If traffic exceeds that, we’re asking customers to sign in, they return to their vehicle, and then we send them a text and tell them when it’s their turn to enter the store. Express: I’ve read that the state of the world is causing people to turn to marijuana now more than they would otherwise. In California, when a lockdown was announced, there was a run on marijuana stores. Hellyar: Last weekend for example, we experienced record sales. And we believe it’s a combination of our medical patients who are concerned about having continued access to the product, making sure that they have ample supply, and adult-use customers, who are coming in in large numbers and buying the full range of our products. We’re seeing that in the numbers, what you said. Express: I know that your company has been aggressively opening new stores and spreading across the state. Has the coronavirus crisis interrupted that? Hellyar: To this point we have not seen any delays. We now have a full license for adult use and medical at the Walled Lake location [in Metro Detroit] where we are planning to open in the coming days. We see nothing that will prevent that from opening based on the situation as it stands today. And this morning, the state — as they promised to the citizens of Michigan — they are turning around delivery license applications within 24 hours. That was the case for our Walled Lake location, so as of this morning we were awarded a delivery license for that location, and when we open within the next few days, we’ll be able to offer delivery from day one, to both medical patients and qualified adult-use customers. Express: You’ve started making deliveries from your Honor location, including to Traverse City. Has that been very popular? Hellyar: Traverse City makes up the large majority of deliveries that we’ve made from our Honor location. As word spreads of our delivery capability, combined with the 10 percent discount that we’re offering on home deliveries, we are seeing a daily increase in the demand for home delivery. It’s picking up every day. Express: Elsewhere, in other countries and other states, places reach a point where the authorities decide the population needs to be locked down, and non-essential businesses are ordered to close. Do you expect marijuana stores will be considered essential or non-essential stores if that occurs? Hellyar: What we would foresee is that our provisioning centers would be seen as important to remain open, for the top priority, which is to serve the medical patients of Michigan. We don’t foresee that changing, based on conditions as they stand today. But this is a very fluid environment, and we are managing it on a day-to-day basis and following the guidelines of the state of Michigan. The most recent executive order to close down bars and restaurants, that did not apply to our business. The conversations that we’ve had have been around how we can continue to maintain the supply of product to the medical patients and the customers. We’ve not had any discussions about closures. Express: Is your production facility running as usual? Hellyar: Our cultivation facility in Evart, Michigan, remains fully operational. As everyone has been encouraged to do, we’ve just enhanced the already very strict controls we have, the hygiene controls and the procedures we follow. We have taken some steps to spread out our labor hours over the full 24 hours so that we can achieve social distancing objectives, just like the rest of the country is pursuing. But the amount of product that we’re harvesting each week has not been impacted at all. Supply is plentiful, and we foresee that continuing. Express: How about you? How are you doing with all of this stuff? Hellyar: Well, we’re remaining positive. We know that this situation will pass. And at Lume, we are all focused on maintaining the supply of products to our medical patients and following the guidelines of the state of Michigan, monitoring what’s happening in the rest of the world, and making sure that we’re moving quickly to adjust and making sure that we’re following the directions of the local authorities and doing what we believe is best.

Afendoulis can be seen behind him to the left. Langlois, who dropped out of the congressional race, recently endorsed one of his former opponents. (Cory Morse | MLive.com file photo) Cory Morse | MLive.com GRAND RAPIDS, MI — Republican businessman Joel Langlois, who dropped out of the 3rd Congressional District race earlier this year, is endorsing GOP state Rep. Lynn Afendoulis. Afendoulis, of Grand Rapids Township, is one of five candidates seeking the Republican party’s nomination in the August primary to represent the West Michigan district in Congress. She and Peter Meijer, an Army veteran whose family founded the Meijer retail chain, are regarded as the front-runners. “I got to know Lynn on the campaign trail, and I am confident she has our conservative values at heart, which she has proven through her track record,” Langlois, who owns the DeltaPlex Arena & Conference Center in Walker, said in a statement. “Voters can look at her history to see how she\'ll vote in D.C. I know she will work with President Trump to get our economy going again, defend our borders and stand up to the socialists in D.C. who are threatening our way of life in America and here in West Michigan. Not all the candidates can prove they will do the same.” Langlois, 59, suspended his campaign in February, citing “personal reasons.” On Thursday, when asked to elaborate, Langlois said there were “some family health issues that we had to deal with.” Afendoluis is a longtime corporate communications director for Universal Forest Products. She won her first term in the state House, representing Michgian’s 73rd District, in 2018. She announced she was running for the 3rd Congressional District seat in June. Her campaign also announced the endorsement of pastor Andrew Jackson Willis. He was also seeking the nomination but has since dropped out of the race. ""I am so honored to have earned the support of both Joel and Andrew,” Afendoulis said in a statement. “Joel is a well-known, respected businessman, Andrew is a dedicated pastor, and both are patriots who were in the race for all the right reasons and who I grew to admire for their strongly held conservative values and the manner by which they conducted their campaigns.” In addition to Langlois and Willis, Afendoulis has been endorsed by more than 20 state lawmakers, according to her campaign. Langlois, in an interview with MLive, said Afendoulis is “light years ahead of Meijer from a conservative standpoint.” He also said the fact that Meijer comes from a wealthy family makes it difficult for him to understand “main street American conservative beliefs.” “Meijer’s a nice kid, but he’s really not a true conservative,” Langlois said. He pointed to Meijer’s past support of With Honor Fund, a political action committee whose mission is to elect veterans — Democrats, Republicans and independents — to Congress. Meijer had served on the board of the organization but is no longer affiliated with the group, his campaign confirmed. He also singled out Meijer for a $250 donation to Common Defense/Beyond the Choir Action Fund made in October 2016, amid the then 2016 presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Common Defense is an advocacy group founded by veterans who oppose Trump. When asked to respond, Meijer’s campaign spokesperson, Noah Sadlier, said Langlois’ critiques were “cheap shots.” “Peter will never apologize for supporting fellow veteran leaders like John James, Dan Crenshaw and Brian Mast,” Sadlier said in a statement. “With the endorsement chase off her plate, hopefully State Rep. Afendoulis can finally focus on doing her job. In contrast, our campaign has been dedicated to serving our community in this time of need.” Michigan’s 3rd Congressional District includes the city of Grand Rapids and a large portion of Kent County, part of Montcalm County, as well as Ionia, Barry and Calhoun counties. The district is currently represented by U.S. Rep. Justin Amash, who was elected in 2010 as a Republican but left the party in July to serve out the remainder of his term as an independent. Last week, Amash, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, announced he was pausing his congressional reelection campaign as he considers whether to run for president. Hillary Scholten, an immigration attorney, is seeking the Democratic nomination in the August primary election to represent the district. This article has been corrected to show that With Honor Fund is a political action committee whose mission is to elect veterans — Democrats, Republicans and independents — to Congress.

ALPENA — One more Alpena County resident is infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, District Health Department No. 4 reported today. That brings 105 the number of infected county residents since the virus hit Michigan in mid-March. Twelve Alpena County residents have died while infected with the virus. Thus far, 82 Alpena County residents have recovered. Across Northeast Michigan, five Montmorency County residents, 18 Alcona County residents, and 12 Presque Isle County residents have been infected since mid-March. One Alcona County resident has died. Health officials suspect there could be an increase in the number of positive tests coming in the next several weeks after a free drive-thru testing event on Friday in Alpena. Health Officer Denise Bryan said 168 people were tested then, and their results could be available in the next several days. It could take up to 14 days before the results are received by the Health Department, she said. Bryan said she was pleased with how the National Guard conducted the testing and in the turnout of people, despite the hot weather that day. “I was hoping to test 100 people with all of the work and time we put into this, so I’m really happy with the numbers and with how things went,” she said. Bryan said there is a chance the National Guard could return in about a month to do more testing, but that will depend on whether tests are available and if the Guard is able to return. “There are availability issues, and we just need to see if we can make things line up,” she said. The state reported 179 new cases Monday and another seven deaths. In all 61,409 Michiganders tested positive for the virus, of which 5,853 have died. Health officials continue to remind people to wash their hands frequently and avoid touching their face.

Services. The city of Saline is one of only two municipalities in Washtenaw County that doesn’t already contract with the county for this service. Goals for this change, according to a presentation by City Manager Colleen O’Toole, include continuation of exceptional service for emergency and non-emergency callers; enhanced risk mitigation, particularly for low-frequency/high-risk events; and long-term fiscal responsibility. The agreement covers a 15-month period that is set to begin in early April 2024. When that happens, the city will eliminate the four full-time and four part-time dispatcher positions it currently uses to provide 24/7 coverage. Washtenaw County Metro Dispatch will then take over the majority of duties previously filled by Saline’s dispatch staff. A number of remaining, non-dispatch, responsibilities will be transferred to a newly created Community Relations position. The move is estimated to provide savings of $170,000 annually. The council voted to support the motion despite vehement opposition from residents. At least 15 citizens spoke against the idea during the public comments portion of the agenda. Reasons for opposing the motion varied but most centered on the loss of local jobs, concerns about delayed response times, and the loss of the personal touch and familiarity with the city. One resident said, “I am very against getting rid of the dispatchers. I think that that would cause an undue delay. If someone is breaking into my house and I have to call Washtenaw County to get a policeman to come to my house, I could be dead.” O’Toole reassured those in attendance that there was no expected difference in 911 response times. Calls made to 911 already go to Metro Dispatch, not Saline, and she says that will not change. The only change will be for calls made to Saline PD’s non-emergency number and Metro will still direct those to a Saline officer first when one is available. O’Toole also said the number of officers on duty will be the same. Saline Police Officer Jen Schoeneich, speaking as a private citizen, shared about powerful experiences she’s had with Saline dispatchers that she feels couldn’t be replicated with Metro dispatchers. For example, last fall a non-city resident approached the Saline Police Station with her two-year-old child after escaping a physical assault by her spouse at their home. Schoeneich said, “This was the first time she got the courage to report it.” Though the address was not Saline’s jurisdiction, the local dispatcher was prepared and invited her into the station to wait safely while Metro dispatch took more than 90 minutes to send an officer from the right jurisdiction. Having them on hand for just the occasion, the dispatcher provided snacks, juice, and crayons to the toddler and encouraged and supported the woman as she continued to wait. Knowing the mother wouldn’t be able to provide the necessary information and also tend to the baby, the dispatcher led Officer Schoeneich and the toddler to another room to watch cartoons. This allowed the young woman to interview for over an hour. Schoeneich said, “The trooper left, went out and arrested the husband and the mother was able to return back home.” In their remarks, all of the Councilpersons reiterated how important Saline’s dispatchers have been to the city’s safety, that all of them have done their jobs very well, and all are encouraged to apply for positions with Metro Dispatch, which has a more valuable overall compensation package than the city. Saline Police Chief Marlene Radzik agrees that the Saline dispatchers are top notch. She said, “We have well trained and stellar dispatchers here at Saline PD. I hope they do apply for Metro-Dispatch so the connection between the officers and dispatchers remains. Metro-Dispatch would be lucky to have them.” Still, Radzik says public safety is her main concern. “The City of Saline continues to grow, it would be irresponsible of our leadership to not look into the future and put measures in place to keep up with the growing population,” said Radzik. Contracting with Metro Dispatch is believed to be a more modern approach to large-scale emergencies–considered high-risk/low-frequency events–where precise, real-time coordination between multiple departments, agencies, and even municipalities is often necessary for a positive outcome. Richard Edwards, a surviving victim of the shooting in Saline in August, attended the council meeting and said that after being shot he called the Saline Police Department, spoke with Lisa (a Saline dispatcher) and officers responded within minutes. He said he was later told that the alleged shooter was apprehended within six or seven minutes of ending the call and that if he had called 911 instead, it would’ve taken a lot longer. “I’m afraid to walk down the street,” said Edwards. Though the response to the August shooting was extraordinary, it is widely understood that was partly due to the fact that emergency response training for several law enforcement agencies was happening just a few streets over, at the time. This significantly increased the availability of and proximity to emergency responders. Councilperson Dell’Orco, who cast the sole nay vote, opposed the motion because it lacked wording specifying that the new Community Relations role would be a part of the collective bargaining agreement with the police union. Because at least one other council member voiced a similar concern, it was decided that classification of the new Community Relations position as union or non-union would be discussed at a later date and in conjunction with union leadership.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:57 pm David Lloyd Soles On Monday, Dec. 21, 2020, David Lloyd Soles passed away in the COVID-19 ward at Mercy Memorial Medical Center in Muskegon, Mich. at the age of 77. David was born March 30, 1943 in Ardmore, Pa., to Willis and Alice (Risley) Soles. He grew up in rural Pottstown with his younger sister, Helen (Soles) Rouse, attending Boyertown High School. As a child he was passionate about music, mastering both tenor saxophone and string bass in his formative years. He was president of his high school marching band and played in events and competitions across the east coast. His love of the woods and outdoors led him to the Boy Scout community where he ultimately was bestowed the prestigious rank of Eagle Scout. The virtues of scouting provided him with a blueprint for life. College took David to Cornell University Hotel Administration program. He would often play gigs at night with his string bass to help pay the tuition. In the summers, he managed the Christopher Ryder House on Cape Cod (Chatham, Mass.) where he met his wife, Elizabeth Anne Hiscock. It was a match made in heaven. Anne and Dave were married June 17, 1967 in Dowagiac, Mich. David enlisted in the Air Force Officer Training Program as an accountant, and the newlyweds made several moves around the country courtesy of the Air Force, including stops in Tucson, Ariz. (Davis-Monthan AFB), San Antonio, Texas (Lackland AFB), Selma, Ala. (Craig AFB). The late 60s were one of the most trying times for our country with the Vietnam War front and center. While David loved our country, he could not reconcile this passion with the bloodshed that was taking place. After considerable internal struggle, he registered within the Air Force as a conscientious objector. This was one of the most difficult decisions he ever made. Dave joined a CPA firm near his hometown in Stroudsburg, Pa., but Anne’s parents lived in Michigan and an incredible teaching opportunity presented itself. In 1973, Anne and David packed up one last time and moved to the sandy shores of Pentwater, Mich., which quickly became their forever home. David joined the faculty at West Shore Community College where he founded the hotel and restaurant program and taught business administration. A highlight for the Soles family was attending the student-produced dinner and theater events each season. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” sticks in our memory. Anne quickly established herself in the geriatric care community of Oceana Country. In 1984, David and two colleagues from WSCC left the university and started one of the area’s first, if not the first, start-up software companies — Houk & Soles — specializing in business flow and operations software for restaurants. Their software was used by restaurant and food service operations around the Midwest as well as with Gordon Food Service for their sales force and clients. In 1973 when Anne and Dave moved to Michigan, they bought the property right between Anne’s parents (Francis and Elizabeth Hiscock) and her aunt and uncle (Russel and Mary Louise Blades), firmly establishing a family neighborhood on Old State Road. They were loyal members of Centenary United Methodist Church where David served as treasurer. In this community, they raised their son, Christopher who works for NIST in the federal government in the metro Washington D.C. area and their daughter Elizabeth, an economic advisor for the Grand Haven Chamber of Commerce. David is preceded in death by his father, Willis; his mother, Alice; and sister, Helen. He is survived by his loving wife, Anne; his son’s family (Christopher Soles, Sung Yun and Isaac Soles); his daughter’s family (Elizabeth Butler, James Christopher Butler and Madelyn Butler); and his faithful dog, Will. He is missed dearly by all. Considering the COVID-19 situation that tragically took David’s and so many other people’s lives prematurely, the family will host a memorial service later this year at the Centenary United Methodist Church in Pentwater. Details will be provided when it is safe to gather. Beacon Cremation & Funeral Service, King-Hart Chapel, is in charge of arrangements. www.beaconfh.com The Herald Journal mobile app brings you the latest local breaking news, updates, and more.

interviewed her. Rashida Tlaib is all smiles as she drives up to our designated interview spot. We’re in Stoepel Number 1 Park, in Detroit’s historic Rosedale Park neighborhood. It’s part of Michigan’s 13th Congressional district, which Tlaib is trying to defend in her August 4 primary. She steps into the park’s tennis courts, which have weeds poking through them, gives an elbow-bump greeting and happily poses for photos. This is the first time Tlaib has talked to the Detroit Jewish News. She and her staff claim this is the first time they were aware the JN had tried to contact them; but in fact, the JN has made several interview offers to her since 2018, when she became the first Palestinian woman elected to Congress and began making headlines for her vocal criticism of Israel. As a member of “the Squad,” a group of progressive women legislators of color that also includes Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, Tlaib’s words echo far beyond Detroit. Now, Tlaib’s district (which includes large portions of Detroit and Dearborn Heights, as well as communities like Romulus, Ecourse and Inkster) is dealing with high rates of COVID-19 and ongoing protests against racism and police brutality. “Have you seen the marches?” she asks. “Jews and Muslims holding signs together… It makes me smile.” Tlaib’s primary race, against Detroit City Councilwoman Brenda Jones, is competitive, and some Detroit-area Jews see danger no matter who wins. At the same time, Tlaib has many Jewish supporters, and says she wants to have a respectful dialogue with everyone. “I have an open-door policy,” she says. “Even when we disagree, if we can look at each other in a way that at least we feel heard, that’s all I ask.” In that spirit, here is what Tlaib told JN about her identity in Congress, the BDS movement and fighting bigotry of all stripes. This interview has been edited for clarity. Well, instantly I think of my community. I grew up in Wayne County, all my life in Southwest Detroit, and have worked with organizations like Detroit Jews for Justice on stopping water shutoffs, pushing the community benefits movement in the city, always working side-by-side on social justice issues. That is what I want people to remember. I truly believe in human rights for everyone. I think they’ve been misinterpreted or not fully understood. If people saw me more as a granddaughter, versus a congressmember, they would understand why I have said we need to push for true equality and justice in Israel. The lens I bring to the issue is something I hope people welcome because I don’t think there has ever been a member of Congress with a living grandmother or relatives in the occupied territories of Israel. I hope people see an opportunity, not something negative. When I was at Sugar Law Center, as a nonprofit lawyer, I was working for JVP on community benefits agreements and co-ops and worker justice. Rabbi Alana [Alpert] of DJJ and so many others came to testify and say we have to do something about water shutoffs, and that water is a human right. We’ve always come together on social justice issues in my district, and we continue to work together. What’s great is, I’m just Rashida to them. I’m that girl that you can call, go file a FOIA, or the one to hold hands or even do Shabbat together. And as soon as, obviously, I won [in 2018], all of the negativity that came with it, all of them rushed to me and said, “We have you, we’re going to defend you. You’re ours.” It makes me emotional, when they say, “You’re our Rashida.” We’re very close. He’s a brother to me. It’s personal reasons, injuries and things like that. But for me, he is very much still my mentor and my close friend. He’s just not physically leaving work this time to come on the campaign. Well, they want true change that’s meaningful, real. A resolution on police brutality is great, but how about looking at what we prioritize in our budget? They want to feel heard in that sense. And when a mother tells me, “Our children’s children went to court for the right to literacy,” what does that say about where our priorities are? The fact that Black children in the state of Michigan went and begged to read: “Teach me to read.” It shows just how broken the system is. What I’m hearing from them is, enough, let’s really talk about structural racism. And it starts with how money is spent. Is it on mass incarceration, or is it on a park like this [gestures around], that probably needs a little bit more love right now? I had to work twice as hard, primarily because the 13th congressional district is the third-poorest in the country. And what that really means is having to be as rooted and grounded in neighborhoods as much as possible. We have four neighborhood service centers. So much of our resources, the staff is in the district, versus in Washington, DC. I’m one of the top 10 members of Congress that had the most town halls, out of 435. That’s pretty good for a new freshmen member. It’s beautiful because my residents are my partners. They really know what’s best for them. And I can’t come and say, “This is what we’re going to do based on what’s happening in DC.” It has to be, what do you think should happen? What do you think we should do in the next relief package? Can you do something about childcare? And so what’s changed is we realized we needed to do that, but it’s been a significant portion of how we approach our work. I always tell people, I have been a person that hasn’t sold out. I don’t take money from corporate polluters that have fueled environmental racism. I have not taken money from developers who have reduced our access to affordable housing. I am so centered on making sure that I don’t waiver or back down on these issues that, again, are very much severe for my residents. I don’t know. It’s my mere existence. I get asked more about the issue of Palestine than my BOOST Act, more than the other issues. That’s unfortunate, but I’ve been very good about pivoting and saying, “Well, we need access to water, from Gaza to Detroit.” I don’t think I would be as passionate but for my Palestinian roots, for the fact I grew up in the city and have seen, firsthand, people’s oppression and the struggle of being a child of immigrants. When I get asked about Palestine every so often, I speak the truth. And that seems to draw people’s attention. Many of my colleagues have thanked me for just being there, and said, “I didn’t know that was happening. I didn’t ever see it that way.” Well, yeah. I mean, annexation. “Hey, Rashida, what do you think?” Well, of course I’m like, “Yeah, let me explain to you what that looks like on the ground. Do you know, there are literally roadways that Palestinians cannot use?” It’s that perspective of having people understand what it means through my lens… I think that’s what’s happening with a lot of my colleagues is, they lean on me as a Palestinian-American. Well, I absolutely support freedom of speech, and people want to taint the freedom to boycott.

I raised my voice and said, “I believe in that kind of movement.” I don’t know where we would be in our country without the Montgomery bus boycotts. It’s something that’s part of our American fabric. So absolutely, people need to stop saying that the BDS movement is somehow anti-Semitic — there are Jews who support the BDS movement. There are folks who truly believe in stopping racism of all forms, and they use the boycott as a form of speech. I don’t think so. No. I look at now with the “defund the police” movement. I hear my residents. They want us to reimagine and invest in their communities. That’s what I hear, but some of my colleagues don’t hear that; they are coming from a different perspective. It doesn’t make them less progressive. I think of 2013, when Black Lives Matter was birthed. People literally were like, “I don’t know, don’t all lives matter?” There were memos being shared to stay away from that movement, that somehow it meant maybe harming police. It misconstrued what it meant. But if you look at the foundation, it was mothers, Black mothers, who lost their children to police brutality and gun violence,'}]"

He was stationed in Germany during the Korean War and was assigned to the Army Security Agency. His unit monitored radio traffic of the Soviet troop, ship, and submarine movement. He was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, Army of Occupation Medal, Good Conduct Medal, and Marksmanship. He was discharged March 15, 1955, attaining the rank of Corporal. He remained in the Army Reserves until April 6, 1960. Following his honorable discharge, he attended and was graduated from Michigan State University in East Lansing in 1959, earning a bachelor’s degree in landscape architecture. As an avid outdoorsman, Mr. Wicks enjoyed waterfowl hunting, fishing, and spearheading. He often volunteered his time and talent teaching youth to fish and carve fish decoys. His greatest talent was woodworking. He entered his first decoy carving competition in 1967, and went on to win blue ribbons in several national and regional competitions. His work was recognized in 1987, when he represented the State of Michigan at the Annual Festival of American Folklife in Washington, D.C. The event, sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, invited Mr. Wicks to display his spearfishing and waterfowl decoys on the National Mall. In 1988, he was the first waterfowl decoy carving artist to receive the Michigan Heritage Award. Many of his carvings can be seen in museums throughout the United States, most notably the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum at Michigan State University, the Wildfowl Museum of the Ward Foundation in Salisbury, Maryland, and the Betty Odine Wildlife Gallery (Marshlands Museum) in Gibraltar. He also served as president of the Michigan Decoy Carvers and Collectors Association and was made a lifetime member. Over the years he shared his talent with other artists, teaching classes at the Michigan State University Museum and several locations in the Lansing area and Curtis. As a resident of the Curtis/Germfask area for the past 33 years, Mr. Wicks volunteered at the Seney National Wildlife Refuge and the Erickson Center for the Arts. He and his wife also ran the South Lake Decoy Shop in Curtis for many years. Their decoys can be found all over the world. He is survived by his wife, Margie of Portage Township; two daughters and their families, Pam and Ed Quinn of Hudson, Wisconsin, and Karen and Steve Langhart of Dallas, Texas; a stepson and his family, Jim and Kim Gleason of Auburn, and grandchildren, Shannon and Kevin Quinn, Spencer and Amelia Langhart, and Katie and James Gleason. He is also survived by a sister, Rosemary Wade of Bellaire; his companion dogs, Angel II and Jeannie, and his companion cats, Hummer and Heidi. In addition to his parents, Mr. Wicks was preceded in death by a sister, Ruth Sutter, and a stepson, Bill Gleason. A memorial service celebrating his life will be held Saturday, October 17, at 11 a.m. at St. Timothy’s Catholic Church in Curtis with Father Phil Witkowski officiating. Memorial contributions may be directed to the Eva Burrell Animal Shelter, 6091 West US Highway 2, Manistique, MI 49854 or the Erickson Center for the Arts, P.O. Box 255, Curtis, MI 49820.

Saturday, June 6. The Montague protest took place at the city’s giant weather vane off of Dowling Street. The week prior, the protest was preceded by one in the City of Muskegon, and is just one protest of many to have taken place in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by a Minnesota police officer. Floyd was arrested on May 25 in Minneapolis for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The arresting officer, Derek Chauvin, was caught on camera kneeling on Floyd’s neck during the arrest which ultimately led to his death. Chauvin and Floyd, according to some news reports, had both worked as bouncers at the same nightclub for a period of time. The two reportedly did not get along. Members of the White Lake community at the protest included people that were young and old. Connie Crancer said she was out there “to stand with everybody against the injustice to what happened to Floyd. Enough is enough, to share my presence and my voice and my words.” She said she was glad there was a protest held in Montague since she thought she’d missed her opportunity after Muskegon had theirs. “I saw what was on the news, I’ve never seen anything like that. I’ve heard about it, and enough is enough. “Just because it hasn’t hit me at home directly doesn’t mean I don’t want to stand up and say something.” Local resident Oscar Kent said he has been the victim of racial profiling on more than one occasion. “I’ve been a victim myself. Mostly, I lived in a white neighborhood, and they (police) have stopped me wanting to know why I was there, and those sorts of things,” said Kent. He said before moving to the area, he had lived in Lansing. He said he had a gun pulled on him by police. He also said he was profiled in Montague when he was looking for a house to move into. “The gun holding on me [sic] was in Lansing, and when we first moved up here, I was looking around at a house, and I got asked by a man what I was doing,” said Kent. He said he hasn’t had a problem with police since he’s moved to the area, because he made sure to go to the police department and introduce himself. Whitehall graduate Julia Bedau, said she hasn’t been a victim of racism, but she has seen it happen with how some of the students in Montague treat people of color. Witnessing it is ultimately what made her decide to switch schools and attend Whitehall High School. “My dad’s an immigrant. I have tons of friend growing up who are people of color. Witnessing how students have treated them at Montague, the jokes they’ve made, I don’t agree with it,” said Bedau. Local city councilmembers Bruce Froelich and Susan Newhof both attended the protest. County commissioner Ken Mahoney and his wife K.P. Mahoney also were there. “I’m very concerned, at a national level we have a criminal justice system that very obviously has some strong biases. Where many people of color, have trouble raising bail money obviously, and are charged more frequently with serious offenses than people who are not of color,” said Froelich. “We should all share this concern, and hope to improve things through legislation, and voting in the upcoming elections.” Mahoney said police brutality hasn’t been an issue in Muskegon County, but he is aware of the issues being discussed nationally after spending some time living in Chicago. He said racial discrimination in policing is still an issue in local policing, but it isn’t as apparent as other places. “I went to school in the southside of Chicago, so I know what some of the issues are. You don’t see them here in Montague so much.” For one local religious leader the death of George Floyd has made him think more deeply about white privilege in religion. “White privilege, that white people look at things from a certain point of view. If white privilege pervades everything it has to be pervading our sermons. We haven’t thought about that in a while, said pastor Doug Ogden, Lebanon Lutheran Church in Whitehall. “We need to think about how does a person of color read this Bible story; how does a person hear this sermon? And it may very well be different.” In the 80s Ogden said he protested against apartheid in South Africa. He said at the time he had been appalled by U.S. domestic policy when it came to that issue.

Brewing Company in Ishpeming pours a customer a craft-brewed beer. (Journal file photo) Editor’s note: Much of the nation has been shut down over the past two-plus months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But now the economy is reopening, and businesses of all types are quickly ramping up for what they hope will be a busy summer season that will return them to some sense of normalcy. To help mark the reopening and tell the positive, meaningful stories of how we’re all rebuilding after a very uncertain time, today we’re launching the first part of an ongoing weekly series titled “Reopening.” Each week we’ll delve into a different aspect of the reopening, how local businesses are dealing with it and the positive impact it’s having on our communities. The first installment focuses simply on a state-by-state look, across nearly one-third of the nation, of where we are in the reopening process. While the national toll for deaths related to COVID-19 eclipsed 100,000 last week, states across the country currently find themselves in various stages of their respective reopening plans, which has proven to be a sign of optimism from local leaders that the outbreak is trending in a positive direction. MICHIGAN Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on May 22 extended her stay-at-home order to June 12 for the lower parts of the state. Effective May 22, in the northern Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula, restaurants and retail shopping establishments were able to open with social distancing and occupancy restrictions in place. Theaters, gyms, salons and some casinos still remain closed statewide. Iron Mountain Mayor Dale Alessandrini said in the U.P., the cases are very few and as long as people abide by social distancing guidelines and wear masks, things should be opening up. He said he has mixed feelings about the opening guidelines, which allow bars in the northern portion of the state to open, but not barbers. “You go into a bar, and there’s people in there, right next to each other, but yet, you can’t go into the salon and get your hair done,” Alessandrini said. “So some of it, I think, is unnecessary. The salons should probably be open because they take the precautions with face masks and shields. Yet when you walk into a bar, there’s no precautions taken.” As the owner of a greenhouse, he and his employees have been abiding by safety protocols, wearing masks and sanitizing surfaces frequently. He said areas like tennis courts are being opened because they are played at a reasonable distance, unlike contact sports such as basketball. “I agree with the gyms not being opened, because there’s a lot of touching,” he added. WEST VIRGINIA West Virginia continues its reopening this week, as the Mountain State enters week six of Gov. Jim Justice’s Comeback plan. The state’s five casinos are allowed to open this Friday. Over this past weekend, pools, limited video lottery operations and other businesses saw their first opportunity to open since March. Also last week, museums and visitor centers could reopen, along with state park cabins and lodges — for in-state visitors only — and bars, with capacity reduced by 50 percent. Wayne Waldeck, co-owner of the Blennerhassett Hotel in downtown Parkersburg, said the lounge opened Thursday to go along with indoor dining, which resumed with a reduced capacity and tables spaced so that chairs were 6 feet apart when pulled out. Waldeck said he’s been surprised with the amount of customers they’ve seen since reopening, which he attributes to safety practices like servers wearing masks and gloves. A different employee clears the table or, if that’s not possible, the server puts on an additional pair of gloves “so there’s never any cross-contamination,” he said. “People are bringing (older) mothers and fathers in because … they feel safe,” Waldeck said. The hotel has been offering outdoor dining for weeks, and it remains popular with the weather warming up, Waldeck said. But he noted cooler temperatures didn’t exactly discourage people either. “It was colder than blazes a couple nights but … people just wanted to get out,” he said. While the hotel side of the business took a hit when travel restrictions were in place, Waldeck said they’ve recently had guests from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Cleveland and Columbus in Ohio spending Friday and Saturday nights. “On the weekend, we’re really booking up,” he said, suggesting the lack of a high number of cases in Wood County, West Virginia, may make people feel better about traveling to the area. “We’ve been delighted.” When Waldeck and Lee Rector announced their purchase of the hotel last fall, they highlighted plans to establish a world-class spa at the site. “We were all ready to go” when the pandemic started slowing and shutting activity down, he said. “Now that we’re reopened, it’s back on the front burner.” Columbus residents Stan and Deborah Ling stopped at the hotel’s restaurant Friday en route to meet family at Seneca Rocks. “We always stop here. This is one of our favorite places,” Stan Ling said. “And we were thrilled to find out they were open.” OHIO Businesses across the Buckeye State have reopened via the “Responsible RestartOhio” plan, and Gov. Mike DeWine lifted the mandatory stay-at-home order May 19. Manufacturing and distribution companies and retail services have reopened, but staff is required to wear face coverings, conduct daily health assessments and maintain cleaning procedures. On May 26, gyms and fitness centers were allowed to reopen and baseball and softball teams will be allowed to play, as long as they follow guidelines set by the Ohio Department of Health. Child care providers and day camps may reopen May 31 with reduced numbers of children. Catering and banquet facilities may open again on June 1 and are limited to 300 guests with similar guidelines to restaurants. Justin Phillips, owner of Six More Miles Tattoo Saloon in Norwalk, Ohio, said when his shop was shut down, he received no government assistance, so he welcomed the ability to reopen with open arms. “It’s a breath of fresh air and a relief,” he said. “We needed this, our families needed this. Every business needs to do their part to make sure this doesn’t happen again.” PENNSYLVANIA The Keystone State, for one, is in the process of reopening based on positive case numbers, which are still high in more densely populated regions. Gov. Tom Wolf’s color-coded reopening plan consists of red, yellow and green phases. There remain 10 counties in the southeastern part of the state that are still in the red phase, which is the most restrictive, though Gov. Wolf announced Friday that those counties will move to the yellow phase on June 5. The majority of the western part of the state, including Washington County, will move to the green phase next Friday, which has the fewest restrictions as a result of the pandemic, meaning restaurants, salons, gyms, theaters, shopping malls and casinos may open at 50 percent capacity with social distancing restrictions. Jeff Kotula, president of the Washington County Chamber of Commerce, said that when businesses move into the green phase, the social distancing measures and “healthy practices” that they’ve been maintaining the last two months will need to continue. He said customers will want to feel safe when they begin patronizing businesses again. “We understand that businesses, especially small businesses, are eager to reopen and welcome their customers back,” Kotula said. “And while that is the ultimate goal, we have counseled our businesses to open based upon customer demand for their products and services. This may take some time as customers need to feel safe to patronize businesses again, but it will be beneficial to both the business and customers in the long-term.” VIRGINIA Virginia is in phase 1 of its “Safe at Home” plan, which means that retail stores can open with restrictions, restaurants may open for outdoor seating or takeout, and beaches may be used for exercise or fishing.

It will be much slower than they’re used to working, she said, as only one client per stylist can work at a time. “We want to work but we have to make sure we’re being safe about it,” she said. FLORIDA Gov. Ron DeSantis’s reopening plan is in Phase 1, which reopened much of the state’s businesses. Beaches, parks, restaurants, gyms and fitness centers, salons and retail shops are all open, under many restrictions relating to building capacity and social distancing guidelines. Vacation rentals, theme parks, bars and nightclubs, which typically boost tourism across the state, are expected to open with restrictions next'}]"

nominee Joe Biden on Wednesday held a lead in Michigan which could turn out to be determinative in a tight race with President Donald Trump as votes continued to be counted in key states. Trump, meanwhile, began to outline legal strategies to challenge votes in states where he was trailing, including Michigan, a move which could delay the final outcome of the fractious election for weeks. By Wednesday afternoon, Biden held a 248-214 edge in the Electoral College as Trump continued to hold a lead in Pennsylvania, which was considered one of the few remaining paths he had to winning. But in Michigan shortly after 9 a.m., Biden went ahead of Trump for the first time since the polls closed the previous night. By 5:30 p.m., Biden led Trump by 70,511 votes, 49.9%-48.6%, according to the Associated Press count of the state\'s tally, with 99% of the expected vote in. That\'s nearly seven times the 10,704-vote margin Trump won the state by over Hillary Clinton in 2016. Speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday afternoon, Biden stopped short of saying he\'d won but said he was on his way. ""I’m not here to declare we won,"" he said. ""But I believe when the count is done, we will be declared the winner."" The 5.39 million votes counted so far was still short of the total cast in the historic election, with an unknown number yet to be tallied, meaning it was possible Biden could add to that that total. As the counting proceeded through the early morning hours Wednesday, there were large numbers of absentee ballots that were tallied from Michigan\'s biggest counties, including Wayne, Oakland, Macomb and Kent and it was believed that was where the bulk of any remaining votes were.

If all the current trends in states nationally were to hold and Trump wins Pennsylvania, Michigan could still be the tipping point state to give Biden 16 Electoral College votes toward the 270 he needs to win the election, but that remained at least somewhat in doubt with the counting not concluded. Biden led Trump in the popular vote nationally by some 2.99 million votes as of late Wednesday afternoon. More than 3.26 million votes were cast by absentee ballot in Michigan. It was from among that huge bloc of votes that those still-uncounted were still being tallied and they were expected, according to polling and other modeling done by the candidates, to continue to swing toward Biden, the former vice president.
