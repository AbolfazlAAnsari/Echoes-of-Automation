National Day of Prayer May 2 April 17, 2024 By: Dwayne PageThis year, the National Day of Prayer celebrates 73 years of prayer for America! This observance acknowledges the blessings of living in a country where, by law, every year on the first Thursday of May, the President proclaims a day of prayer for the nation.The National Day of Prayer observance was created in 1952 by a joint resolution of Congress and signed into law by President Harry Truman. Each year since then the president has called upon the citizens of the nation to pray, and in 1988 President Ronald Reagan established this day of prayer to be the First Thursday of May. The significance is that it enables everyone nationwide to recall and to teach the way in which the founders sought the wisdom of God when faced with critical challenges and decisions. It stands as a call for everyone to humbly come before God, seeking His guidance for the nation’s leaders and His grace upon us as a people.Local pastors and churches would like to invite you to join with them, others from your community, and people from across our nation, as they plead for God’s mercy and guidance in our country.
