'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'October 19, 2023 Hamas’ Saturday, October 7 attack on the Jewish State plunged the Middle East into chaos, led to thousands (and counting) civilian and military deaths, and has compelled The Daily Mail at least to begin considering the prospect of WWIII. Apart from now-rampant fears of escalation, the conflict between Israel and the Gaza Strip-based terrorist group has inflamed a war of words across the Western world. The war has dragged everyone from students to intellectuals to celebrities and public officials into the fray and certainly has not spared Dartmouth. As reports rolled in throughout the weekend of Hamas’ atrocities, it remained unclear how or if Dartmouh’s Administration would respond. After all, our colleagues in Cambridge remained tight-lipped throughout the weekend, even as thirty student organizations released a statement supporting the terrorists. Would Dartmouth remember the civilian victims of Hamas’ terrorist savagery with the same eagerness that we prosecute alcohol violations? Would we stand with civilization and order? Or would we equivocate? An air of schizophrenia permeated that weekend: Corners of the American ivory tower stood slack-jawed at the fruits of their rhetoric about ‘resistance to occupation’ and ‘apartheid.’ Thankfully, President Beilock did respond. Her October 10 statement, while not exactly the most timely, expressed concern about the events in Israel: “Like many of you, I watched with growing horror the Hamas attack on Israel this weekend, the escalating violence, and the devastating loss of life, especially among civilians.” The President continued, “Adding to my deep sorrow over the overwhelming human tragedy playing out in Israel and Gaza are the ways in which the war affects Dartmouth’s global community and many of our colleagues, peers, and friends.” That the statement only briefly mentioned Hamas, which chose to conduct its attack at the end of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, was regrettable but not unusual. Harvard President Claudine Gay’s statement on October 9 did little but express how “heartbroken [she was] by the death and destruction unleashed by the attack by Hamas that targeted citizens in Israel this weekend, and by the war in Israel and Gaza now underway.” Although public pressure did (rightfully) force Gay into releasing another, stronger condemnation of Hamas, it is hard to imagine how one could expect more from Ivy League leadership than boilerplate ‘sympathies’ and ‘heartbrokenness’ in response to any crisis. Indeed, it was not in our College’s public statements that we distinguished ourselves in response to Hamas’ violence but, rather, in the broader campus reaction. To the Administration’s credit, it took the initiative to sponsor two interdisciplinary ‘forums’ on October 10 and 12 to discuss the conflict. Both events filled Moore’s Filene Auditorium and deployed professors from across the faculty to unpack the horrors from the weekend. Speakers at the Thursday forum included the Eli M. Black Distinguished Professor of Jewish Studies, Susannah Heschel; the Jane and Raphael Bernstein Professor in Asian Studies, Jonathan Smolin; former Egyptian diplomat and Senior Lecturer Ezzedine C. Fishere; and Visiting Professor Bernard Avishai, who is himself an Israeli-American and former West Bank settler. The most heated moment of the panel came when a student introduced his question with a minutes-long explanation of how Dartmouth hadn’t “condemned” Hamas while the Administration had clearly targeted Russia in its statements at the start of the War in Ukraine. Professor Heschel, visibly nonplussed, responded that Dartmouth’s opposition toward Hamas was so “obvious” that it needed not to be underlined. She further suggested that statements from university presidents about foreign wars might themselves be a waste of time, considering their “reductionism.” Apart from this student’s filibuster, the forum proceeded smoothly, respectfully, and candidly. It even opened with personal reflections from each of the speakers about their heritage and personal connections to the broader religious conflicts in the Middle East. Indeed, Dartmouth’s Israel programming seemed to have escaped the vitriol and violence that has captured the public square at other universities. At the Hillel- and Chabad-sponsored vigil for Israel, held after the Thursday forum, around 300 students gathered on the Green, where organizers read poems of mourning and tragedy, prayed for the Israel Defense Forces, and sang Hatikvah, the Israeli national anthem. There was no disruption or counter-protest, save for the moment when a Safety and Security officer inspected an unattended backpack. Beilock’s speech was brief, but it unequivocally condemned Hamas. She noted her own Jewish heritage and was on the verge of tears. Senior Vice President and Senior Diversity Officer Shontay Delalue also did not shy away from recognizing Hamas’ evil. Where Dartmouth could have easily failed and joined its counterparts in the Ivy League at the table of moral equivocation, it met the bar and, even, exceeded it. It is hard to explain just how the College’s response to the Israel-Hamas War has been so extraordinary. The Administration has certainly fumbled in response to tragedy before—forgetting to release a statement on 9/11 but remembering when the Supreme Court voted inconveniently (twice). The Review and our pro-Israel advocacy through the decades certainly isn’t the reason. Nor is the reason a sudden change of heart from the American left that dominates this country’s institutions, including Dartmouth. To deduce that, one need only examine the civil war among congressional Democrats over Israel. No matter the reason, credit is due where credit is due. When the Jewish State was attacked, our College did not back down from addressing the conflict. However improbably, it returned to the model of truthful, respectful, and free academic discourse that it used to uphold. And in the midst of a tragedy like that which the world has experienced in recent weeks, our College’s reaction has been a justification for hope. A bit of, more less, good news!

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:06 pm CONCORD — Hunting seasons have arrived in the Granite State as has a renewed public interest in exploring woodland trails, paths, and byways. As we enter into the Granite State’s extremely popular deer season, hunters must be aware of increased recreational activity in New Hampshire’s forests and fields. All outdoor enthusiasts, no matter where they venture, must be committed to ensuring their own personal safety while understanding the different ways residents and visitors enjoy all that New Hampshire has to offer. Be sure to be seen—blaze orange is common sense for people recreating outside during hunting seasons. Here are some additional tips to help everyone have a safe and enjoyable fall: • Be aware of your surroundings. This seems like common sense, but remembering and acknowledging that it is hunting season will improve your awareness. Know the dates of hunting seasons in your area by looking them up online in the annual NH Hunting and Trapping Digest at www.huntnh.com/ hunting/publications.html. Many hunting seasons, especially firearms seasons, are much shorter in duration than most people realize. • Pick the right trail. During the fall, stick to established hiking trails. Hunters generally avoid heavily used hiking paths because activity in the woods usually frightens game species. The noise and foot traffic on main trails is not an ideal place to hunt. • Pick the right time. Legal hunting times in New Hampshire for most game run from ½ hour before sunrise to ½ hour after sunset. Wildlife, and consequently hunters, are most active at dawn and dusk. Midday hikes when light conditions are optimal are best for the fall. You are also much less likely to run into a hunter during mid-week hikes because most hunting takes place on weekends. • Wear hunter orange. Anyone who enjoys the outdoors in New Hampshire should already own a piece of bright “blaze” orange clothing, and fall is the ideal time to wear it. An orange hat, handkerchief, vest, or shirt is a must for this time of year. This will make you more visible to anyone in the woods. Don’t forget to also put some orange on the family dog. • Make some noise. Talk, sing, or whistle to make your presence known in the woods. Chances are good that anyone in your vicinity has already heard you, and the singing will make you more noticeable. This is great advice for any time of year, and placing a bell on your dog’s collar is another excellent way to make continuous noise during a hike. • Hike safe. Be sure to follow the hiker responsibility code by being knowledgeable about where you are going and what the local weather and terrain conditions are, leaving your plans with someone, staying together, turning back in inclement weather or if you are running out of daylight, and planning and preparing for emergencies are also important.

Charles Krupa By KATHY McCORMACK Associated Press Associated Press CONCORD, N.H. — A judge has found the New Hampshire publisher of a weekly community newspaper guilty of five misdemeanor charges that she ran advertisements for local races without properly marking them as political advertising. The judge acquitted Debra Paul, publisher of the Londonderry Times, of a sixth misdemeanor charge on Thursday following a bench trial in November. She is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 20. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine. The New Hampshire attorney general’s office charged Paul last year, saying she failed to identify the ads with “appropriate language” indicating that they were ads and saying who paid for them as required by state law. The office said it had warned her in 2019 and 2021. Last year, it received more complaints and reviewed the February and March issues of the paper. Two political ads leading up to a local election in March did not contain the “paid for” language and a third had no “political advertisement” designation, according to a police affidavit. Shortly after her arrest, the 64-year-old put out a statement saying “This is clearly a case of a small business needing to defend itself against overreaching government.” Her lawyer, Tony Naro, said at her trial that Paul never meant to break the law and tried to follow the attorney general’s office instructions. Naro said in an email Friday that while disappointed with the convictions, “we are considering all legal options moving forward” after Paul is sentenced. Article continues after... Cross|Word Flipart Typeshift SpellTower Really Bad Chess “What should not be lost in this story is that my client is a small business owner, who provides an important service to the community,” Naro said. “With the rapid disappearance of small independent newspapers, I hope that the community will continue to support the Londonderry Times.” Paul also was a member of the Londonderry Town Council, but didn’t seek re-election in March. She responded to a request for comment Friday by providing a different judge’s recent order over a Right-to-Know lawsuit she filed against the town to make public a complaint filed against her by the town manager in February. The judge found in her favor and called the complaint frivolous. The complaint and lawsuit are connected to the political ads case, she said. 05-31-2024 9:01 AM 05-29-2024 1:30 PM 05-28-2024 4:33 PM 05-28-2024 3:37 PM Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy About Us Accessibility By using this site, you agree with our use of cookies to personalize your experience, measure ads and monitor how our site works to improve it for our users Copyright © 2016 to 2024 by Concord Monitor.

Opioid abatement funds totaling $62,713 were used to purchase the two scanners, approved by the Rockingham County Board of Commissioners. Rockingham County received at least $2.87 million from the latest round of opioid settlement funds from various pharmaceutical companies and distributors who had a hand in the New Hampshire’s opioid crisis. The state received the majority of $310 million in settlement funds, but 15% was distributed to 23 counties and towns which filed their own lawsuits against the companies. “When fentanyl was introduced, it became very dangerous for us to even field test the drug,” said Major Christopher Bashaw from the Sheriff’s office. He mentioned that a few Rockingham County deputies experienced nonfatal overdoses from fentanyl exposure in the last couple years. “The last thing you want to do is get someone hurt over securing potential evidence,” he added. “Our individual safety far exceeds the evidence’s value.” He recalled an evidence processing deputy who was handling drugs and using test kits inside the sheriff’s office back room. Fentanyl became airborne when some of it was taken out of a container and tested. The deputy overdosed from the drug becoming airborne. The DetectaChem scanners reduce exposure by allowing officers to point and scan at packages and identify the substances through packaging in about 20 seconds. The devices can detect 24,000 different chemicals, as well as explosives. Bashaw said that the scanners will also help streamline testing at the over-booked New Hampshire state lab, narrowing down the range of tests required and moving cases along faster. Quick information from the scanners will help determine if an area needs to be secured or evacuated. The devices will also help determine if further protective measures are needed as calls can become fluid, turning from court-ordered evictions to drug investigations. — Angelina Berube/The Eagle Tribune Jaffrey Public Library offers legal help services The Jaffrey Public Library has partnered with 603 Legal Aid and New Hampshire Legal Assistance to connect the community with free legal information and services. On Wednesday, Sept. 13, at 6 p.m., the library will host Chris Schott from New Hampshire Legal Assistance (NHLA), who will provide a presentation titled “Fair Housing and Tenant Rights in NH” on the Fair Housing Act and what other protections are available for tenants facing eviction in New Hampshire. Schott is the fair housing project coordinator at NHLA. He has been a staff attorney with NHLA since 2018. In his time at NHLA, he has served low-income citizens of New Hampshire in a number of legal areas, including assisting victims of domestic violence with receiving protective orders, helping seniors who are victims of elder exploitation and assisting tenants facing eviction. Currently, as coordinator of the Fair Housing Project, he assists tenants and homebuyers facing discrimination in housing. Prior to the program, on Sept. 13, the library will host a drop-in with 603 Legal Aid from 4 to 6 p.m. to connect qualified individuals with free civil legal resources. 603 Legal Aid helps low-income individuals by providing free civil legal advice and information and referrals. Topics include family law, civil rights, housing, tax issues, benefits and criminal record annulment. The 603 Legal Aid drop-in will be a monthly program at the library. Both programs are free and open to all, regardless of residency.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 9:20 pm Dale Girard's Golden Cross Ambulance service provided EMTs to Saturday's Trump rally in Claremont, NH. CLAREMONT, NH — As part of our coverage of former President Donald J. Trump’s visit to Claremont, we asked Mayor Dale Girard for his thoughts. Girard, a Democrat, was directly involved in the event as his company, Golden Cross Ambulance, provided emergency medical service coverage for the event. He praised Claremont’s police and fire departments for their roles in providing security and fire protection. “Both departments did an outstanding job,” he said, noting the very large crowds that came to the city. Girard said that Claremont has a long history of hosting presidential candidates at Stevens High School. He remembered Trump’s 2016 visit. Asked what Trump’s visit meant for the city, Girard answered, “His visit spotlights our community and puts us on the local and national stage for the day and will help us, in some ways, with marketing our community to folks who generally would not be visiting Claremont.” Asked about his general reaction to President Trump’s decision to come to Claremont, Girard responded, “As many recognize, President Trump is a polarizing individual. No other candidate has his appeal to draw this amount of energy to a community. This energy in our community is needed. The event brought folks from both sides of the political aisle. The individuals who came to our community provided an influx to our economy.” All in all, Girard believed President Trump’s visit was good for Claremont. “Hosting an event of this stature shows our community can accomplish anything,” he stated. In addition to Trump’s event, former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy have hosted campaign events in Claremont. Ramaswamy and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have hosted events in Newport. Ramaswamy has also made a campaign stop in Plainfield. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and business mogul and pastor Ryan Binkley of Texas appeared in Charlestown at the Sullivan County Republican Committee’s annual dinner. Binkley has also campaigned in New London. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. appeared at events in Walpole, then running as a Democrat. Having left the Democrat Party, Kennedy is now seeking the presidency as an Independent candidate.

These beliefs are reinforced by media economics commentary and across political parties. But what if they’re wrong? The world’s largest asset manager, overseeing $10trn in assets across the globe, thinks we are, instead, entering a period of increased risk and uncertainty, defined by unavoidable recession and much higher inflation. BlackRock—a well-connected, influential and hugely profitable pillar of global capitalism—made the predictions in its ‘2023 Global Investment Outlook’ report. It states: “The Great Moderation, the four-decade period of largely stable activity and inflation, is behind us.” Instead, BlackRock forecasts a new regime with a “brutal trade-off”—falling living standards for the many becoming profits for the few. This reality, of a world undergoing fundamental transformations and disrupting our settled modes of existence, has so far barely entered the economic mainstream. For BlackRock to break with this consensus might, potentially, be one of the first signs of a broader shift in how major institutions in the Western economies view the world. Systemic Chaos Annual food inflation in the UK rose to 13.3 percent—an all-time high—last month, according to trade body the British Retail Consortium, ahead of the official government figures out later this month. This situation—though slightly worse in the UK due to a flawed Brexit deal and the falling value of the pound (critical as a major food importer)—is common across the globe. Even as wholesale energy prices have dropped from their summer 2022 peak, the price of food everywhere is soaring. United Nations’ forecasts show a major risk of widespread famine in the Global South over the next year, with harvests continuing to underperform. This global spike in prices over the past 18 months was initially described by the economic establishment as “transitory.” Then, as inflation continued remorselessly upwards, familiar explanations reappeared: notably, excessive worker power (but real wages in the Global North are still falling) and excessive printing of money through quantitative easing (but we’ve been running QE since 2009). The economic profession as a whole, and institutions such as the major central banks, have typically written down the obvious evidence of global instability as temporary factors, rather than something more systemic. This means we’re trapped with central banks that still think pushing up interest rates to induce a recession is a smart way to bring down inflation. Governments are committed to holding down wages and salaries while allowing profits to explode. But BlackRock believes the world is now “shaped by supply that involves brutal trade-offs”—in other words, the world economy is less effective at supplying goods and services than it was. The after-effects of the pandemic have caused supply chain problems, as we all know, but they also think an ageing population means fewer workers, pushing up the cost of labour; that “geopolitical tensions” will disrupt global supply chains; and that the shift to net-zero carbon emissions will involve “demand and supply mismatches.” Put all this together, and BlackRock thinks inflation will come down to the 2 percent level we’ve been used to only if central banks are prepared to ‘crush’ their economies into a severe recession. Since that’s unlikely, inflation will stay much higher than we are used to—combined with a miserable recession over the next year or so. Massive Profits for the Lucky Few But BlackRock’s predictions don’t cover everything. Its report misses the longer-term effects of Covid—both in terms of the impact on healthcare and, as we’re currently seeing, continuing waves of infection. It also misses, critically, the wider ecological impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss and resource depletion. It is possible to imagine a world where peace returns rapidly to Ukraine, and the subsequent disruptions to global food and fertiliser trade are reduced. It is not possible to imagine a world where climate change and ecological destruction are thrown into reverse—indeed, some of the effects felt today, notably, biodiversity loss, are irreversible. This twofold combination has led ecologist Nicholas Beuret to describe a “climate supercycle” of food shortages and rising prices running well into the future. (A recent episode of my podcast ‘Macrodose’ examines the coming food shortages for UK farmers.) And, finally, BlackRock misses the extreme profits that shortages over the last year have generated for a select few multinationals, such as those supplying oil and gas. It’s the last part that’s critical. A more unstable world affects everyone, but it will affect everyone differently. For most of us, on the wrong side of food price hikes and extreme weather, the future is not great. But for the lucky few, shortages have been turned, through price rises, into massive profits.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Saturday slammed Sen. Joe Manchin’s (D-W.Va.) widely panned proposal to explore slashing Social Security benefits as part of a debt ceiling pact with Republicans. In an interview with Fox Business at the ruling class’ annual gathering in Davos for the World Economic Forum, Manchin suggested that members of both major U.S. political parties “work together” on solving the nation’s so-called “debt problem.” Although Manchin didn’t explicitly demand cuts to Social Security and expressed opposition to GOP calls for privatization, he singled out the program for intervention, saying that Congress “should be able to solidify it.” Given that Republicans are currently threatening to tank the global economy unless Democrats agree to reduce social spending, Manchin’s unilateral call for appeasement has set off alarm bells. What’s especially concerning to progressives is that the corporate-backed lawmaker is the co-author, alongside Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), of the TRUST Act, a bill that would enable Congress to create bipartisan “rescue” committees for the nation’s trust fund programs—including Social Security and Medicare—and give the panels 180 days to develop “legislation that restores solvency and otherwise improves each.” Measures put forth by the bipartisan committees would be fast-tracked for floor votes in both chambers of Congress, with no amendments allowed. Not only is Social Security legally incapable of adding to the federal deficit, but budget analysts have shown that the program is financially sound, requiring just a small increase in payroll tax revenue to ensure full benefits beyond 2035. “The last thing we need is another commission to propose cuts to Social Security and Medicare,” Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted Saturday. “The last time we had one, it proposed cutting Social Security benefits for middle-class seniors by up to 35 percent and cutting tax rates for billionaires,” Sanders added, referring to the notorious 2010 Bowles-Simpson Commission, on which Manchin and Romney’s bill is based. Former Clinton White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson (Wyo.), the Obama-appointed chairs of that commission, both endorsed the TRUST Act in 2021, calling it “important and vital.” Historically informed critics, by contrast, have condemned Manchin and Romney’s legislation as “a Trojan horse to cut seniors’ benefits.” Sanders’ staff director Warren Gunnels provided additional historical context on Saturday, linking to a 2012 essay in which the senator explained that in addition to seeking to cut wealthy households’ tax rates and current retirees’ Social Security benefits, the panel also proposed raising the retirement age to 69 years, slashing veterans’ benefits, increasing interest rates on student loans, and eliminating 450,000 federal jobs, among other harmful measures. On Wednesday, Manchin asserted that his and Romney’s bill could be used to secure a debt ceiling deal with House Republicans, many of whom have vowed to not lift the country’s borrowing cap—an arbitrary and arguably unconstitutional figure set by Congress—unless Democrats agree to shred vital social programs. The U.S. government’s outstanding debt officially hit the statutory limit of $31.4 trillion on Thursday, at which point the Treasury Department started repurposing federal funds. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told congressional leaders last week that “the use of extraordinary measures enables the government to meet its obligations for only a limited amount of time,” possibly through early June. She implored Congress to “act in a timely manner to increase or suspend the debt limit,” warning that “failure to meet the government’s obligations would cause irreparable harm to the U.S. economy, the livelihoods of all Americans, and global financial stability.” Notably, Capitol Hill’s deficit hawks do not support reducing the Pentagon’s ever-expanding budget or hiking taxes on the rich to increase revenue. On the contrary, the first bill unveiled by House Republicans in the 118th Congress seeks to rescind most of the Inflation Reduction Act’s roughly $80 billion funding boost for the Internal Revenue Service—a move that would help wealthy households evade taxes and add an estimated $114 billion to the federal deficit.

The Salem School District has succeeded in improving the town’s schools. Now, it’s time for the town to do the same for municipal buildings, he said. “We know our infrastructure is important,” Devine said. “We have a lot of projects in the future.” Since joining the town in 2022, Devine has worked with the Municipal Buildings Advisory Committee to address the needs of the town’s buildings. The police department’s concerns for a new station have been at the forefront of discussions and why the project has failed in the past. Deficiencies can be found throughout the police station.
