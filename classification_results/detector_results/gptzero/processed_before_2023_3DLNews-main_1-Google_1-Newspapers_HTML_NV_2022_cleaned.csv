April 25, 2022 By Andrew Barbano Leave a Comment “All the world seems in tune on a spring afternoon when we’re poisoning pigeons in the park.” — Tom Lehrer 1959 I’ve warned you many times and I admonish you again: Don’t let your kids play on the plastic turf at Sparks’ Golden Eagle Park. According to last week’s Tribune, the Sparks City Council spent $64,000 “to purchase SMG SportChamp artificial turf maintenance equipment” for the biggest expanse of crumb rubber turf in the country. The NFL loves that hazard. It’s very photogenic for TV and it’s cheaper to maintain than that newfangled stuff called grass. If you’ve ever watched replays of football players kicking up black dust on pretty green turf, you’ve seen ground-up used tires containing almost 100 chemicals, some cancer-causing like lead, arsenic, cadmium and benzene. I started beating the drum about this on Nov. 24, 2015. I’ve talked to local high school coaches who are embarrassed to admit they know of the danger but are powerless to fight the system. Crumb rubber turf infects schools all over Nevada and the nation. Locally: McQueen, Damonte Ranch, Manogue, Carson and Douglas high schools; the Jan Evans Juvenile Detention Center, UNR’s Mackay Stadium, Wolf Pack and Peccole parks. (Photo and archives at ConsumerCoalitionv.org/) More than 12,000 crumb rubber fields were in use as of 2019 with 1,200 to 1,500 more expected each year. Only limited studies have been done and have shown no ill effects. Everything seems to have stopped after 2019. Hmmm…did some big health scare suck all the air out of the research rooms starting in 2020? Much of this is déjà vu all over again. A few years ago, Fallon cancer cluster research proved inconclusive despite an inordinate number of kids getting sick and dying. Cancer cluster designation proved a hard label to come by, especially since Churchill County air is besotted with pesticides, naval air base jet fuel and heavy metal manufacturing. Most fingers pointed toward the latter. Colonia High School in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, has been in the news after activists documented 105 brain tumors (half cancerous) among graduates starting in 1972. I predict that years of study will show “no clear causation” meriting cancer cluster designation. As with crumb rubber turf, affected industries will tout exoneration. Beware. MORE KIDDIE HAZARDS. I saw a piece on KOLO TV-8 last week showing a moppet scaling the climbing wall at the 9th Street Boys & Girls Club. She had no safety harness. Zounds. I made a couple of calls to those in charge. Stay tuned. MEDIA MELTDOWNS. KRNV TV-4 has been covering 60 seconds of “Saturday Night Live” with a commercial for Charter/Spectrum cable. Last week, the spot preempted some of the opening skit. On the previous two weekends, the same ad covered part of the “Weekend Update” news satire. Computer glitch? Probably. Corporations cut corners wherever they can, and that usually means people. A few years ago, the tornado emergency broadcast system in the Oklahoma outback failed because none of the radio stations in the area had anyone working. All were on computerized auto-pilot on a Saturday. People died. MEMORY MELTDOWNS. For folks here in Mississippi West who haven’t heard, this is Confederate Heritage Month in Mississippi proper. MASKING MELTDOWNS. A Trumpappointed (of course) judge in (where else?) Florida just ruled that the Centers for Disease Control has no authority to mandate masks in public transportation. So why have a CDC anymore? Meanwhile, COVID-19 infections are spiking all over the country and worldwide. To its credit, the Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County announced that masking will “continue” to be enforced on their mass transit systems. For more than two years, their foreign contractor, Keolis Transit, has fought the federal mask mandate fang and claw. They have lost every round at the federal level to Teamsters Local 533. (See NevadaLabor. com/) “RTC Washoe made the right choice by not following the decision of a judge in Florida,” said union president Gary Watson. “The RTC and Teamsters have rarely seen eye to eye lately, but this move is a step in the right direction, and a step to continue to protect transit operators and passengers alike,” Watson added. Masks save lives. Wearing one protects others from you but if they are exhaling freely, only an N95 version gives you any cover. After allowing thousands of far east air passengers into the country in February 2020 while telling the public not to worry, Czar Donaldov made mask wearing a partisan brand. That same month, he was recorded by journalist Bob Woodward admitting that he knew how deadly the virus was but still refused to warn Americans. Almost a million now lie dead while the pope of Mara-Loco scores millions running the Republican Party as his profitable family business. NEWS BLUES. Last month, I groused about the Reno GazetteJournal nuking its Saturday edition without giving subscribers a discount. They also killed Saturday delivery for other publications in the region such as The New York Times. Worse, their distribution contractor re-jiggered the system so that the odds of customers on my street getting their papers on any given day are 50/50 at best. At least you can call the Times to credit your account. The Kazoo-Journal sends you to voicemail hell. The official excuse blames “the same labor shortage difficulties that are affecting so many businesses across the nation.” I wonder what they pay in minimum-wage Nevada? Their corporate overlords scored $7 million in pure profit by selling the RGJ building to the City of Reno. So how about taking some of it to better pay delivery drivers? Maybe they read the Trib. Six-day subscribers got a letter last Monday announcing a price DECREASE. Starting on May 10, the price goes down to $73.00 a month, a whopping $5.27 saving from the published rate. Somebody check for snowfall in hell. HAIL TO THE CHIEF. Reno Police Chief Jason Soto announced his retirement effective at year’s end. My money’s on Deputy Chief Oliver Miller as his replacement. I’ve worked with him on community issues for years. He began his career with Sparks PD in 2000. He’s paid his dues and earned the top job. Stay tuned. BIG MIKE’S ON THE MEND. Sparks transit operator Michael Lansborough is still home recovering from successful open heart surgery. He may be cleared to return to work late next month. The longtime RTCRide driver is sole support of his wife and son, Logan, who has no lower legs due to a genetic flaw but still took to his wheelchair and joined dad on downtown Reno picket lines during last year’s Hat Trick Strikes. Friends set up GoFundMe page. Please be generous. If you’d prefer to mail a check, make it payable to Michael Lansborough and send to his attention at Teamsters Local 533, 1190 Selmi Drive, Suite 100, Reno NV 89512. Thanks to all the Barbwire readers and union members who continue to send support. Tell your friends. Take care of each other and be careful out there. Pray for Ukraine and 53 other currently war-torn lands. Be well. Raise hell. / Esté bien. Haga infierno.

Three of her children were present at the time of her passing but all were there in spirit, loving their mom and expressing their thankfulness for her. Mom was born August 23, 1934 in Cannonville, Utah to Marion and Elva Clark and was the middle child, number five of nine. Dixie attended grade school in Cannonville and graduated in 1952 in Tropic, Utah. Soon after graduation, mom moved to Wendover, Nevada to work at the Stateline Café for her Aunt Lyla and Uncle Sam. In 1953, Dixie and her relatives moved to Hawthorne to open The Nevada Club, a café. Working as a waitress, mom met Thomas H. Pellett and in February 1954 they eloped to Reno, Nevada. Moving to and from small Nevada and California towns was a norm for the young Pellett family. In 1967, Dixie was done moving and settled her family permanently in Hawthorne, Nevada. Mom entered the workforce in 1967 for the Hawthorne Naval Ammunition Depot as an explosive handler. The height of the Viet Nam War required long hours and often seven days a week. After an accident at work, Mom transferred to an office job in the Traffic Division. Here, in traffic, mom became a guru with highways, interstates, and backroads. Her knowledge of the highways and byways of the United States allowed mom to give directions to many. Mom made many friends through her years of work and, like her childhood friends, remained dear in her heart. Mom worked long hours working at the base, took care of seven kids, prepared meals, and cleaned house. However with all her motherhood obligations, mom included time for her favorite hobbies of reading, crafts, and her favorite sports. The New York Yankees, San Francisco 49ers, and the BYU Cougars were her teams. Mom watched them as often as she could but if they were losing, the channel was changed. April 1985, Mom married James M. Bess (Jim) and they had 31 years together. Soon after marrying Jim, they moved to Herlong, California and here, Mom became a fulltime housewife, a ‘job’ she truly enjoyed. Then in 1992, they returned to Hawthorne as a retired couple. Together they had 10 children and this provided them with many opportunities to travel and visit all their children and grandchildren. Preceding Dixie in death are her parents, Marion and Elva, husband Jim, brothers Marion and Dallas, sisters LaRue, Marilyn, Lynne, Lyla, and Zola. Survivors include her brother Steven (VerJean) Clark of Utah, and sister in-law OsaFae Pellett of Winnemucca. All of Dixie and Jim’s children blessed our mom and were her true joy. Tom (Sabrina), Jerry, Mike, Tracey (John), Pat (Holly), Robert, Lisa, Dee (Jon), Susie (Darren), and Jimmy. Grandchildren: Kyle (Summer), Sarah (Billy), Heather (Jason), Courtney, Shawn (Rebecca), Brooke, Megan, Zac (Tab), Hillary (Brandon), Hannah (Bud), Jonah (Alex), Kaitlin (Gerald), Nick, Devin (Regina), and Alyssa (Jeff). Great grandchildren: Mason, Lane, Paige, Olivia, Luca, Kayliana, Sawyer, Austin, Carter, Ashton, Emma, Micah, Asalea, Esme, Henley, Kiley, Natalie, Payson, and an abundance of nieces and nephews. Due to Dixies family being spread across the United States of America, a memorial service will be held Saturday, January 14, 2023 at 11am at the LDS Church.

Group Capt. Shane Tanner, a 24-year military veteran, became Naval Air Station Fallon’s 34th commander during a change of command ceremony Friday. Tanner assumes command from Capt. Evan Morrison, who is also retiring after a 36-year career that included nine years in the Illinois Air National Guard. Morrison said his tour at Fallon has been the highlight of his career, guiding the air station through its required training but also overseeing the safety of his sailors and civilian workforce during the coronavirus pandemic. In his farewell speech, Morrison reflected on his career that begun in 1986 when he enlisted in the Air National Guard when he was 17 years old and then joined the Navy to attend Office Candidate School and then flight school after receiving both his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Northern Illinois University. Morrison said wearing the uniform and serving his country is all he’s known during his adult life. Reflecting over the past 36 years, he said he served with gratitude, thankfulness and pride. “The word ‘serve’ is a common bond for all those who have served,” he said, adding serving is an investment and one of personal character. Morrison added serving also means sacrifice. “It’s a sacrifice of time with your family, missed birthdays with your children, spouses and loved ones. Spending holidays in a remote, faraway locations … suffering mental and physical pain that comes with those sacrifices.” Morrison said he would be willing to encounter those sacrifices again to serve his country. He also mentioned those who served before him and with him and “those who never came back.” “Dignity and respect is more than a tagline — it’s a way of life,” Morrison said about his career. “I’m a big believer in the relationships we develop.” Morrison thanked the support he had received, especially from city and county leaders. Rear Adm. Stephen D. Barnett, commander of Navy Region Southwest, said prior to Morrison’s remarks the change of command is the passing of the torch from one captain to another. Barnett emphasized the importance of family and how they encompass a team effort to make a command successful. “Every family is part of the team,” he said. “You may not wear the uniform, but you deploy like we do.” Barnett discussed Morrison’s command at NAS Fallon and how the air station hosted more than 46,000 multiservice and multinational personnel during their various training requirements. During the past three years, Barnett said Morrison oversaw $46 million in construction projects and the Longhorns Sear and Rescue team completing 20 searches and 10 rescues that resulted in eight saved lives. In addition to becoming involved locally, Barnett said Morrison also engaged with other communities outside Churchill County. Barnett also took Morrison and the audience through a memorable ride to the 1980s, especially to 1986,the year when Morrison enlisted. Barnett reminisced about the songs of that time and noted the movie “Top Gun” also premiered in 1986. As he concluded his remarks, Barnett said Morrison is finishing his career by accumulating more than 3,400 hours of flight time in six types of aircraft. Tanner, a native of New York state and a 1998 graduate of Texas A & M University, said he’s looking forward to working with his local partners, especially with Fallon Mayor Ken Tedford, the county commission and Amber Torres and Cathi Tuni, the tribal chairs of the Walker River Paiute and Fallon Paiute-Shoshone tribes, respectively. During his flying career, Tanner said it was an honor to fly and serve with Morrison. Tanner has accumulated more than 3,000 hours, logged more than 600 carrier arrested landings and completed 174 combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. “We’ve been together on a number of assignments including here at Naval Air Station Fallon,” Tanner said. Their career paths crossed many times during the previous two decades. They both served together at the Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center in 2004 (formerly known as Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center). “Admiral, I am honored to take command of this base,” Tanner said. “With the war drums beating in Europe and the rhetoric increasing in the Western Pacific, there can be no better place of relevance in naval aviation and naval warfighting readiness than where we sit right now in this aircraft carrier strategically beached in the high desert.” Filed Under: News Tagged With: NAS Fallon Your email address will not be published.

2022 2 Comments May 3, 2024 April 18, 2024 October 3, 2023 The Nevada Press Association Board of Directors last week approved a proposal to change the trade association’s membership dues schedule in 2022. Under the new schedule, Regular Member and Affiliate Member dues rates will be based on newsroom Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) rather than circulation or readership. FTEs measure an organization’s full-time employees by counting 40-hour workweeks instead of the number of individuals on the payroll. Dues invoices will also be issued later this year to coincide with NPA’s fiscal year, which begins on May 1. They will be mailed and/or emailed the first two weeks of May. Under the previous dues structure, annual dues for newspaper members (i.e., Regular Members) were based on circulation, with separate scales for daily and weekly papers. Magazines and online-only news organizations, which were first granted full membership rights in 2019, paid one of two different rates that hinged on whether their readership is predominantly statewide or local. [Click here to see a comparison of the old and new dues structure.] NOTE: COMPARISON WAS REVISED MAY 6 TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS IN SCHEDULE FTEs are often used to track project costs within an organization or unit costs in a firm with several subdivisions. Unlike circulation, newsroom FTEs is a relatively stable standard common to all of NPA’s member news organizations. It’s also a rough proxy for the size of an organization’s budget and is relatively simple to calculate. NPA is asking its members to count hours worked within the news department by their editors, reporters and photographers, or other multimedia journalists, when calculating their newsroom FTEs. In making these changes, NPA’s aim was to maintain the organization’s total dues revenue close to $31,000 — its annual total in 2021 — and to keep the annual dues of most member news organizations close to what they have paid in the past. The new dues structure does that. Tags Dues Dues schedule Oct. 1-7, 2023 “A free press is the guardian of democracy. In whatever form, it … Seeking protection under NPA. Nevadacanparty.,com.
