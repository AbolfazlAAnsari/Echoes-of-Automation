(FOX5) - A 25-year-old mother “intentionally” shot her 3-year-old son Wednesday night, according to an arrest report. On Dec. 16, Las Vegas police officers were called to an apartment complex in the 1300 block of South Arlington Street, near Charleston and Nellis boulevards at 7:06 p.m. Lt. David Valenta with the department’s special victims unit said they received a call regarding a 3-year-old who had been shot. The investigation revealed a 25-year-old woman, identified as the boy’s mother Jasmin Vargas, was outside her friend’s apartment among children at the time of the shooting, equipped with a newly purchased firearm. An initial investigation indicated a man within the group had “manipulated” the firearm that went off, however, police on Thursday said Vargas had mishandled the firearm herself, striking the boy with a fatal shot. LVMPD ARREST REPORT In an arrest report, police said Vargas purchased the gun a month ago from New Frontier Armory for her own protection. Vargas said she had never owned a gun previously, but would take the firearm, a 9mm semi-automatic handgun, into the desert to practice shooting. According to her testimony, the gun could hold six total rounds. The day before the deadly incident, Vargas said she fired two shots toward the mountain in the area of Lake Mead Boulevard West. Vargas told police she didn’t realize the gun had remaining rounds in magazine chamber at the time of the shooting. Vargas had driven to her friend Jessica Rivera’s apartment to have her makeup done that night. Rivera’s son, Gabriel, and her younger sister Fabiola Arvayo were also on scene. Before the incident, the friends exited the apartment to “take a stroll,” the report read. The dimly lit apartment complex, which had been the subject of recent auto-burglaries, alarmed the girls, according to testimony. From there, Vargas retrieved a gun from her vehicle to show her friends, the arrest report read. At one point, Vargas handed the gun to Arvayo to hold. “Jessica told Fabiola not to pull the trigger,” the report read. After that, Vargas took the weapon back, claiming that there were no bullets in the chamber. “There’s nothing in there,” Vargas said. She then extended her arm, pointing the weapon a few feet away from both children and Jessica, the report read. With that, she fired a single shot, striking the boy, later identified by the Clark County Coroner’s Office as John Jaffey, in the head. Rivera yelled at Vargas to look at her son, lying blooding on the ground. A neighbor drove them to Sunrise Hospital, where John was pronounced dead. Vargas was arrested and is facing charges of child abuse with substantial bodily harm resulting in death. “She didn’t understand the paramount responsibility of gun ownership and the dangers,” police said. Vargas was set for an initial court appearance before Judge Joseph Bonaventure Thursday afternoon. Jaffey’s cause of death was identified as a gunshot wound to the head via homicide, according to the coroner’s office. Copyright 2020 KVVU. All rights reserved.'}]"

the virus that causes COVID-19 is so contagious — and they’re discovering that it is mutating quickly. The researchers have studied the genetics of more than 8,650 samples of the virus SARS-CoV-2, collected from infected people all over Nevada. The researchers are looking at how quickly the virus is mutating within the community and trying to come up with an answer as to what those mutations will mean for the future of the virus. “We did find certain mutations that were virtually unique to Nevada,” explains Director of the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory, Mark Pandori. “Now, we don’t know what that means, or why that’s the case, but we did see some, what we call ‘point mutations’.” Pandori also says the team found a new mutation that did not originally exist in the virus when it came out of Asia. “It sort of evolved this point mutation, which might have something to do with the transmissibility of the virus and human host,” says Pandori. In a case that made national news, the team of researchers discovered a 25-year-old individual with no significant underlying health conditions who became infected twice. Pandori says the researchers ruled out the possibility that this person simply had the virus for a long time, and it went dormant and then came back. “The genetics of the two viruses for which they were positive were quite different. More different than could be explained by some kind of hidden infection that progressed across the time period. So, it looks like they were infected by two distinct events,” explains Pandori. “I want to warn you that this is not a common occurrence. This can happen, but it may not happen to many other people. Only some people,” says UNR virologist, Subhash Verma. Both researchers say they’re not quite sure why a few people have contracted the virus twice: “We don’t know exactly and the answer seems very complex, one assumption is that antibodies generated from the first infection goes away (reduces significantly) in the two to three months after recovering from infection,” says Verma.
