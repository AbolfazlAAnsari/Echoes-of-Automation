enthusiasts were surprised last week when a fence was erected, blocking public access to the lake. Since that time, access to the lake has grown into a community-wide controversy. Some wonder about the ability to enjoy the popular recreation area in the future. Joe Leply has owned his property on Benka Lake for thirty-five years. During that time, he’s known the public access point to be a beautiful spot for community members to launch watercraft and enjoy the lake. Last week he heard the sound of a pile driver coming from his neighbor’s house. Turns out the pile driver was being used to erect a fence that was intended to block the only developed public access point at the lake. “So when I heard it, then I called the Mat-Su Borough and the enforcement officer came out that day and went down there to talk to the people, but you couldn’t talk to the owner of the thing, you had to talk to his lawyer.” The Benka Lake Subdivision was built in the 1960s and the current public access point has been used extensively as the only realistic access to the lake. Boats enter here, the Department of Fish and Game uses the site to stock fish in the lake and the Fire Department pulls their tankers to the water’s edge and fills from here. In fact, water from Benka Lake was used to fight the 2019 Malaspina fire, which threatened multiple homes in the area. At dispute is a small section between where Lakeview Road ends and Benka Lake begins. Both Lakeview Road and Benka Lake are considered public places. Some neighbors state that there are plats that show a continuous access flow between the two. But at least one plat exists that shows a break between the two. One potential problem, according to Leply, is that not everyone who lives on the lake, has the infrastructure to get their boat out of the water in the fall. “Right now we have seven pontoon boats on this lake that can’t get off”. Christian Whitecar lives a few miles away from Benka Lake. He describes how he enjoys the area. “We go down there with a trailer, drop four kayaks, and then go and paddle the lake. You know, circumnavigate the lake and then pull out and leave. And a lot of people do that. A lot of people that either live on the lake, but a lot of people that don’t live on the lake go there and paddle. It’s very open to the public and usually you see a lot of other people out there besides us.” After the fence was erected many community members were upset. The Mat-Su Borough has received numerous complaints, leading them to launch an investigation into how to resolve the issue. In the meantime, somebody took the matter into their own hands. Twenty-four hours after the fence was put up, it was forcefully torn down and destroyed. Stefan Hinman is the Director of Public Affairs for the Mat-Su Borough. He says it will be at least a couple of weeks before Borough lawyers can pour through all the documents regarding access to Benka Lake and make a determination.

| Featured Stories, News | 0 Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy on Thursday announced a Disaster Emergency for Skagway after a recent visit by state officials. Skagway’s Mayor had previously declared a similar Disaster Emergency after rockslides caused a temporary shut down of its busiest cruise ship dock earlier this summer. A portion of the dock reopened, but estimates say nearly 125,000 cruise passengers had to skip the port. As KHNS’ Mike Swasey reports, the governor’s declaration could provide assistance that will help Skagway mitigate rockfall hazards and expand cruise ship berthing options to accommodate visitors in 2023. Borough officials hope Dunleavy’s Declaration of Disaster Emergency for Skagway will free up federal funds in addition to state funds to help combat the barrage of rockslides that continue to impact the Railroad Dock, and limit the number of cruise passengers that can visit the port. Skagway Mayor Andrew Cremata told KHNS that it’s the best news he could have hoped for. “The Governor’s office has been fantastic through this, they sent an entire team here we spent an entire day with them taking them up in the rock side via helicopter. Some of us hiked up there. Then we had a roundtable with them all afternoon. And they were impressed about the severity of the situation. And they went back to the governor’s office and pled our case, and he declared an emergency,” said Cremata. A geotechnical engineering firm is expected to complete a 10% design plan to mitigate the rockfall later this month. But with only half a year before Skagway’s next cruise season, it may not be possible to completely eliminate the rockfall hazard before ships return in 2023. Skagway officials have been meeting with the owners of the Railroad Dock, White Pass and Yukon Route, to develop a plan to allow four ships a day to visit the town next season. That plan calls for an emergency improvement project on Skagway’s Ore Dock to be completed by next April. The plan would increase capacity to allow a large Post-Panamax or Quantum-sized ship to dock there. Those ships can carry up to 4,000 passengers and 1,500 crew. Some of those larger ships had to cancel calls to Skagway this year as the only dock large enough for them in town is the Railroad Dock. But with its northern berth closed because of rockslide activity, any ships docking at the southern berth have to tender their passengers ashore. And as Cremata says, not all of those large ships have the capability. “The Norwegian post-Panamax Class ships, they don’t have tenders. So if we don’t have a way to dock those post-Panamax ships on the Ore Dock, we’re not going to get them,” said Cremata. He also says if the larger ships can dock on the Ore Dock, that will free up space on the Railroad Dock for two smaller ships south of the active rockslide area. Though they’ll still likely have to tender people ashore. The Broadway Dock can be used for a fourth ship. Borough Manager Brad Ryan says the Ore Dock extension project should cost just under $6 million. “A chunk of that is taking down the ore loader. Another chunk of it is demoing the existing wooden dock. And then there’s driving piles, electrical upgrades…” said Ryan. He also says most of that cost is already accounted for in the municipality’s plan to reconfigure the Ore Dock as a multi-purpose dock in 2024. Engineering firm KPFF is expected to provide the next round of design plans for that project by December. On October 4, Skagway voters will decide whether to approve up to $65 million in Revenue Bonds to pay for updated port infrastructure following the expiration of its 55-year lease with White Pass and Yukon Route. If approved, those funds could then be used for any project on Skagway’s waterfront. Cremata hopes that some of the Disaster Emergency funds could be used to pay the remaining costs of the emergency upgrades to the Ore Dock. “If the revenue bond is approved by voters, three and a half million of those dollars can go into improvements on the Ore Dock for next season in advance of the project being done in ‘24 so that we can have four berths next summer. That’s very important. There’s an additional $1.5 million in estimated cost for that project. So I’m hopeful that maybe some of that relief money could go toward that,” said Cremata. For now, borough officials say they have a verbal agreement with White Pass to move forward with the emergency plan to bring up to four ships a day to Skagway in 2023.

Barbara Billingsley, who played mother June Cleaver, died in 2010. Ken Osmond, who played Haskell, died in 2020. Dow would appear as a guest star on other TV series throughout the 1960s, 70s and 80s, including “My Three Sons,” “Dr. Kildare,” “Adam-12,” “Emergency,” “Square Pegs” and “Knight Rider.” He took a break from acting to serve three years in the U.S. National Guard in the late 1960s. From 1983 to 1989, amid a cultural craze for nostalgia television, Dow reprised the role of Wally in “The New Leave it to Beaver.” He began writing and directing episodes of that series, and would work as a director in television throughout the 1990s on shows including “The New Lassie,” “Babylon 5,” “Harry and the Hendersons” and “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.” At a time when such disclosures were rare, Dow went public with his clinical depression in the 1980s and made self-help videos on accepting and dealing with the illness. Along with appearances in later years at pop culture conventions, often alongside Mather, Dow worked as an artist, gaining a sterling reputation as a sculptor. One of his bronze pieces was accepted at 2008′s Societe Nationale des Beaux-Arts, a 150-year-old art show staged annually at the Louvre. Dow told The Associated Press in 2012 that his openings brought out as many people anxious to rub shoulders with the Beaver’s big brother as to see his art. “I think it’s hard, especially with the Wally image, to be taken seriously at pretty much anything other than that,” he said with a chuckle and a shake of his head. Dow is survived by his wife of 42 years, Lauren, son Christopher, daughter-in-law Melissa, and brother Dion. Newstalk 750 - 103.7 KFQD is a part of Alpha Media LLC.© 2024 Alpha Media LLC.
