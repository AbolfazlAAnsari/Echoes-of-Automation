It serves the area’s residential and recreational communities including Kingfield, Sugarloaf, Saddleback, Stratton/Eustis and Rangeley Lakes regions and Strong and Phillips. The Original Irregular reaches locals as well as the visitors who come here to hike, camp, ski, mountain bike, fish, hunt… you name it. Our circulation is 1,200 and close to one-third of our subscribers are folks “from away” who own hunting, fishing or skiing camps, land, or they just have a special place in their hearts for the area. We’ve had some people tell us they read the Irregular because they like its name! Where did the name “The Irregular” come from? … Back in 1968 “or thereabouts,” when the mountains were still tall, but the paper small, The Irregular came out “irregularly,” or when the publisher and editor had collected enough ads (or meals and libations in trade) to cover production costs. The paper became weekly year-round in 1986. In mid-2019 the paper changed to a bi-monthly schedule, publishing on the second and fourth Wednesday of the month. In October 2020, the Irregular made an historical move —changing with the times— and became an online-only publication. The Irregular has always had a “funky” edge to it and we strive to maintain a bit of that sense of humor. The Irregular is also known for producing quality seasonal publications including the annual winter publication WHITEOUT!, Maine High Peaks Living, and Maine High Peaks Summer and Fall. We have been publishing most of our guides for more than 30 years; they have become the standard publications that people turn to whether they want to know some history about the area, when special events take place, or where the best hiking or skiing trails are.

The Original Irregular is a local online newspaper that covers the Northern Franklin County region in the Western Mountains of Maine. It serves the area’s residential and recreational communities including Kingfield, Sugarloaf, Saddleback, Stratton/Eustis and Rangeley Lakes regions and Strong and Phillips. The Original Irregular reaches locals as well as the visitors who come here to hike, camp, ski, mountain bike, fish, hunt… you name it. Our circulation is 1,200 and close to one-third of our subscribers are folks “from away” who own hunting, fishing or skiing camps, land, or they just have a special place in their hearts for the area. We’ve had some people tell us they read the Irregular because they like its name! Where did the name “The Irregular” come from? … Back in 1968 “or thereabouts,” when the mountains were still tall, but the paper small, The Irregular came out “irregularly,” or when the publisher and editor had collected enough ads (or meals and libations in trade) to cover production costs. The paper became weekly year-round in 1986. In mid-2019 the paper changed to a bi-monthly schedule, publishing on the second and fourth Wednesday of the month. In October 2020, the Irregular made an historical move —changing with the times— and became an online-only publication. The Irregular has always had a “funky” edge to it and we strive to maintain a bit of that sense of humor. The Irregular is also known for producing quality seasonal publications including the annual winter publication WHITEOUT!, Maine High Peaks Living, and Maine High Peaks Summer and Fall. We have been publishing most of our guides for more than 30 years; they have become the standard publications that people turn to whether they want to know some history about the area, when special events take place, or where the best hiking or skiing trails are. (Please Note: print production of our seasonal publications has been temporarily halted.) The Irregular is a member of the Maine Press Association, and the Flagstaff Area Business Association. Our staff includes Heidi Murphy, Publisher/Owner (publisher@theirregular.com) and various freelancers and other contributers. We would also like to thank the many community members that contribute with photos and news bits to give The Irregular that all important local community flavor. You are the heart of the paper.

implemented at Bates, but what I mean by “free laundry” involves a small increase to the room & board fee. As a transfer student, many have asked me about the difference between Bates and other institutions. I spent the first two years of my college life at St. Olaf College, a liberal arts school in Northfield, Minnesota. To be completely honest with you, I haven’t noticed much of a difference when it comes to class dynamics or campus life. In fact, the biggest difference is that I lost free laundry. Northfield is home to two colleges, St. Olaf and Carleton, both of which have free laundry. Living there gave me the impression that all liberal arts colleges should have free laundry since it was genuinely a boon to students’ quality of life. Having to fumble through my wallet for a credit card every time I want to do laundry is obviously undesirable, but there are many other reasons as to why free laundry should be instated. The first one is hygiene equality. Currently, all students are required to pay $1.50 for washing and $1.50 for drying, regardless of their financial situation. Some might argue that the reduced room and board fee in financial aid packages can be seen as compensation for laundry costs, but if students choose to do laundry less frequently to save money, that decision should be theirs to make. Let’s set aside the question of whether or not this can truly be considered a form of reimbursement for now. Instead, consider the logic behind it. When the government is trying to help the needy, they always prefer handing out food stamps rather than cash. Because with cash, you can’t control if people are spending it on food, alcohol, or putting it into the bank. Even though Bates may claim that those with financial aid already have their laundry cost covered, in reality if students are still paying out of pocket, they will try their best to avoid that cost. I interviewed a student who wishes to remain anonymous about this. The student hand-washed all of their laundry during the 2022 academic year. The student receives full financial aid for tuition and room and board, plus a little bit for textbooks. Nevertheless, they decided to hand-wash their laundry because they wanted to be as frugal as possible, prioritizing income towards textbooks and travel. The student attributed their decision behind hand-washing laundry to financial concerns. “It was very hard because all of my classes required a lot of [money], and just for one course I spent $150 for the online platform”, the student stated, “also for Chinese I spent $100 last fall”. “I definitely can find several dollars out of those they give me for textbooks [to pay for laundry]…”, the student conceded, “but I personally prefer to spend more money on travel, rather than wasting them on Starbucks, or kind of wasting them on laundry, as bad as this sounds.” The second reason is sustainability. Contrary to popular belief, free laundry will in fact help with sustainability rather than damage it. This September, Bowdoin College implemented free laundry under the initiative of their Sustainability Office. When students are charged, they might choose to do laundry every other week instead of every week, thus overloading the machine. Detergents cannot agitate properly when the washer is overloaded and clothing won’t be cleaned properly, wasting water and electricity. In extreme cases, overloading will lead to broken machines that need to be repaired at a high cost. Paul Wang ‘24, the Bowdoin Student Government President, told me that free laundry will lead students to do laundry at a more reasonable load, thus reducing machine overload. The third reason, and the biggest in my opinion, is that my rights as a consumer are being violated. This has happened to me at least three times this semester: I put my clothing into the dryer, pay for it, only to return one hour later to find out that my clothing is still wet. I have no choice but to pay for another cycle, knowing that I will never get a refund. The biggest resentment I have towards the current laundry system is that I’m blindly paying for a monopolistic service. There is no way to know if a machine will function properly or not, until we actually pay for it. This is only exacerbated by the fact that CSC Services is a de facto monopoly over Bates’ laundry service. When my clothing was not dried after I paid $1.50, I had no choice but to pay them again, despite the fact that I hated the company and would like to use a different company for laundry service. “I don’t want to do a summoning ritual every time I do laundry and pray the machine will work,” John Baxter ‘24 said, while expressing immense frustration towards CSC’s quality of service. Fiki Hunt ‘24 agreed, adding the following: “the biggest problem right now is I’m essentially doing two loads of drying, because the dryer never works the first time.” I actually researched how I can get a refund; the quick answer is I can’t. I went on CSC’s website and entered the faulty dryer’s machine number. The website prompted me to download their app and submit my refund request there. In it, the only two refund methods were refund as credit to the app or refund to a card that was already linked to a CSC account. So, for someone who doesn’t use the app when they paid, there is no way to get a refund. It is important to address some of the concerns about the implementation of free laundry. Most people I have talked to say that they are worried about machines getting abused and overused. However, it is important to note that Bates already has free printing, but students are not printing 100 pages every day. I could borrow every book from the library and photocopy them, but would I in reality do that? I don’t think so. Just because students can wash one sock per load doesn’t mean they will; especially when you factor in the time opportunity cost. During my interview with Wang, the Bowdoin Student Government President, he stated that: “from my assessment, there has been no abuse, people are responsible about their laundry, and things pretty much stayed the same if not more seamless”. I know some are less convinced by conceptual arguments and prefer empirical data; I have that as well. Trinity Monstwillo ‘26, who serves as a class representative for Bates College Student Government, interviewed Keisha Payson, the Director of Sustainability at Bowdoin College. During it, Payson stated that before implementing free laundry, students’ clothes were not being washed/dried effectively, and they were receiving a lot of calls about faulty machines and card readers. After the implementation, however, they are receiving fewer calls and requests about issues. This suggests that the imaginary abuse scenario is not in fact happening at Bowdoin; free laundry can even decrease maintenance costs. Now, let’s talk about how free laundry can be implemented at Bates. If there is one thing I’m certain about, it is that free laundry can be done. My old school has it, Carleton has it, Williams has it, Amherst has it, Colby has it, Connecticut College has it, Colorado College has it, and now Bowdoin has it too (Amherst, Williams and Bowdoin even provide free detergent to reduce plastic waste). I have to admit, calling it free laundry is a bit of a clickbait, since someone has to bear the cost, and that still has to be us the students. I’m proposing that the school should implement what it is already doing with our meal plan and printing. Bates’ meal plan allows unlimited swipes once students enroll in it, the same goes for our printing system. The school should charge us a fixed amount of money as a part of the room & board fee, and give us unlimited swipes at the laundry machine, like a buffet. This is what Bowdoin did to transition to “free pay” laundry as well, the increased charge was so insignificant in comparison to the annual tuition increase that Wang couldn’t even recall how much they were charged in our interview. Assuming that students want to do their laundry once a week. At the current rate, that will be $3 for a week, $45 for a semester and $90 for a year. Of course, there are breaks we have to factor in, but let’s be conservative with our estimations for now. The school should increase the room & board fee by this amount, in order to give us “free pay” at the laundry machine.

On Feb. 6, three University of Maine organizations addressed the senate to speak on how GSS-granted funds were used, solutions to club storage issues are in the works, and equitable access is being established alongside the inclusive access resolution. Club Presentations: Black Bear Catholic addressed the senate to present a slideshow about their experience at the SEEK National Catholic Youth Conference. The club was able to bring 14 students to St. Louis, Missouri, from Jan. 1 to 5 and expressed gratitude for monetary support from UMSG. Mountain Bike Club had previously requested financial support for weekend trips and van trailer rentals. They competed at Sugarloaf in Maine and Thunder Mountain in Massachusetts. The club representatives thanked UMSG for allocating funds and said they made the Top 15 in Nationals. Men’s Rugby took a trip to the NCR Division II East Regional Tournament in Reading, Pennsylvania, from Nov. 15 to 19. They used the $5,750 provided by UMSG to cover lodging and transportation. The group wants to increase financials independently from various fundraisers, campaigns, and alumni donations. Executive Reports: Student Body President Michael Delorge announced that Senator Cynthia Shelmerdine, Fair Election Practices Commission Chairman Camden Olson, Representative Olivia Britton, and himself will be meeting with the CFO and Dean Dana to discuss plans of renovating Estabrooke Hall from a dormitory into offices. Sodexo administration has also reached out and is seeking students’ opinions. Delorge also issued a special thanks to those who helped plan the concert on Feb. 2. Student Body Vice President Keegan Tripp said he has followed up with Dean Dana regarding the Penobscot Flag Resolution. Tripp and Senator Beau Michaud met with Dean Graham, Director of Retail Operations, and Richard Young, Executive Director of Auxiliary Enterprises, about inclusive access. “I also have a meeting with VPFA Allen and VPSO Ober on Friday regarding club storage. We are getting this project going… It’s going to be a long-term one, but I think it’s important. So, I am excited to have some updates for you next week,” said Tripp. Vice President for Financial Affairs Paige Allen met with the cheerleading captain. They intend to talk with Athletics about allocating funds for the club from their department. That meeting will likely be scheduled for next Thursday. Allen also provided an update regarding the UMSG budget, “Projected and allocated, we have $62,840.90. The second activity fee for the spring semester will be coming in next week, with two returns to unallocated. One from Men’s Rugby for their Nationals and one from the Athletic Training Student Association from a conference that they went on,” said Allen. Vice President for Student Organizations Julian Ober also spoke briefly about finding space on campus for club equipment. Similarly, she has access to all of the previous club items and is looking to return them to any revitalized clubs needing them. Ober also announced the Club of the Week: Chase Your Pace. Though it is not yet recognized, she highlighted this group because it requires new members. This club was created for those interested in running with others at their own speed rather than competitively. The Vice President for Student Entertainment shared that 690 people went to Sammy Rae and the Friends, and 419 attendees were UMaine students. He also purchased movie tickets for Free Movie Wednesday at Black Bear Cinemas for the rest of the year. Vice President for Student Leadership Jacob Chaplin reported that a syllabus bank meeting with Fogler Library will take place on Feb. 7. Periodic Reports: The Board of Trustees (BoT) Student Representative took notes at the Jan. 29 BoT meeting, which can be accessed through the UMSG web page under Resources. Olson will be meeting with candidates to explain the rules. He is searching for a location to hold the debate that is not the North Pod of the Union, since it is famously noisy. Election week commences on March 4. Chase Empsall will be sending out a survey regarding security concerns on campus. Senator Michaud mentioned the possibility of a new bookstore initiative titled “Equitable Access,” wherein students have the opportunity to pay a $230 flat fee per semester for all of their books, as opposed to purchasing each one individually. Workshops will be held to gauge student input about the program. Some majors do not spend over $200 per semester, and those students can opt-out. Lambda Chi Alpha and Phi Kappa Phi have recently been placed on suspension, meaning the two fraternities are not recognized by UMaine for the time being. The Student Heritage Alliance Committee will hold its second meeting tomorrow from 4-5 p.m. for an overview of the yearly budget and to discuss the formation of a cabinet committee. A president, vice president, treasurer, and faculty advisor will be appointed soon. Concert for a Cause donations raised $130 in addition to food and clothing donations. Wilde Stein will be hosting a Queer Trivia event at 4 p.m. on Feb 9 in the Multicultural Student Center (room 312). An International Dance Festival is taking place on Feb. 24. Entry is free, and 20 performers from across all continents (besides Antarctica) will be welcomed. New Business: An act was passed to allocate $2,458.40 to the Maine Animal Club for their NESA Conference. $320 will be paid toward registration and $2,138.47 to cover hotel fees in Amherst, Massachusetts, from Feb. 24 to 25.

announced on Friday, Feb. 9 it has contracted with Page Architects for the design of its Community Health Center to be constructed in Thomaston. “Knox Clinic is delighted to announce they have engaged Page Architects to move forward in planning a new space in Thomaston,” the nonprofit stated in a press release. “Page has a strong track record in creating spaces that focus on patient care, staff efficiency, and community wellness, making every space functional and healing.” “We are thrilled about this official partnership with Page,” Knox Clinic Executive Director Meredith Batley said. “Page is an essential partner helping us create a Community Health Center that serves all of our neighbors through integrated primary medical care, dental care, counseling, connection to local resources, wellness services and more!” Batley had updated the Thomaston Select Board on the project on Jan. 22. At that time she said the organization has selected an architect for the project, but could not release the name of the firm yet. Batley did say the company selected was at the forefront of health care design, and that Knox Clinic was really lucky to have this architect. In the Feb. 9 press release, Page Architect’s Healthcare Market Sector Tushar Guptar said the firm was inspired by the plan for the new health center and excited to collaborate with Knox Clinic. “We envision a welcoming health center offering dignified and compassionate care. Reinforcing the Clinic’s commitment to sustainability, we aim to design an environmentally responsible and nurturing environment.” Knox Clinic has also engaged Cordjia Capital Projects for owner’s project management, Gartley & Dorsky for civil engineering and Lark Studio for landscape design. Knox Clinic said they expect construction to begin in early 2025. The sale of 1.5 acres of land on the Thomaston Green to Knox Clinic for construction of a community health center was narrowly approved by voters at the June town meeting. Since then, Waldoboro was federally designated as a medically underserved area. This opens additional federal funding for incoming medical projects. In January, Batley said Knox Clinic has been working with Health Management Associates consulting firm to put together the application for the organization to become a federally qualified health center. This would allow the new health center to accept Medicare and MaineCare, plus private insurance and offer a sliding scale of fees for services. The next step for Knox Clinic is the Planning Board process. A meeting with the Thomaston Planning Board has not been set yet, but the public is invited to attend these meetings and provide feedback. Batley has said she invited the public to contact her as well with ideas and thoughts on design aspects of the health center. Interested parties can email suggestions or photo examples to info@knoxclinic.org. The town has set comprehensive guidelines for design which the clinic must operate within. The Knox Clinic is currently seeing patients at 22 White St., Rockland in the Bok Building. To learn more about the project, to become a new patient, or to make a tax-deductible donation, please call 301-6996, or visit knoxclinic.org.

Maine\'s culinary cachet is making national headlines again, with two restaurants — including one that hasn\'t yet opened for business — touted on prominent go-to lists. With less than a week before Valentine\'s Day, OpenTable\'s list of ""America\'s Top 100 Romantic Restaurants"" features Earth at Hidden Pond, in Kennebunkport. It is the only Maine eatery on the list. ""Earth promises a once-in-a-lifetime meal that will leave you wanting more,"" OpenTable says in its description of the restaurant. It\'s ""nestled amongst balsam and birch trees,"" the write-up reads, and ""founded on a philosophy that cherishes community and connects excellent food to the farmers and foragers who provide its resources."" The review goes on to praise the eatery\'s ""basic yet innovative food"" grounded in farm-to-fork freshness. Among other New England states, New Hampshire has one venue on the list and Rhode Island and Connecticut each have two, while Massachusetts and Vermont failed to make the cut. The list was compiled following an analysis of more than 12 million diner reviews on the reservation website. Metrics included ratings and the percentage of restaurant reviews tagged by diners as ""romantic."" The Earth at Hidden Pond is owned by the Kennebunkport Resort Collection. “We are honored to be recognized as leaders in the culinary industry in Kennebunkport,” said Justin Grimes, regional managing director of Kennebunkport Resort Collection. “The team at Earth comes in each day prepared to present guests with a unique experience, and being recognized by OpenTable as the most romantic restaurant in Maine is a great affirmation of the hard work they put in every day.” For Valentine’s Day this year, Earth is offering a special four-course pre-fixe menu for $100 per person and five courses for $115 from Feb. 14-18. Dessert options include flourless chocolate cake, doughnuts with sassafras and sarsaparilla, and key lime pie with raspberry coulis and Chantilly cream. (And as of Friday morning, reservations were still available.) Find the full OpenTable list here. The other restaurant grabbing national attention this week is Douro, an all-day eatery scheduled to open this summer on Portland\'s eastern waterfront as a ""love letter to the fishermen, oyster farms and seafaring peoples of the Atlantic Coast."" Months before opening its doors at 110 Thames St. in the Portland Foreside neighborhood, Douro is featured on the Robb Report list of ""The 18 Most Hotly Anticipated Restaurant Openings in America This Year."" Twelve Executive Chef Colin Wyatt will also lead Douro, where he\'ll create ""an all-day spot with a focus on the region\'s outstanding seafood,"" according to the luxury lifestyle magazine. Wyatt previously worked at New York’s DANIEL and Eleven Madison Park. Twelve is owned and operated by the Prentice Hospitality Group, whose other hospitality holdings include Evo Kitchen + Bar, the Chebeague Island Inn, House Island, Cape Elizabeth\'s Good Table and a catering company called 58 Culinary. Portland Foreside developer Casey Prentice told his followers on LinkedIn that he is humbled to have Douro featured in the Robb Report list. He also said he is ""super-excited for Douro to join Twelve and Bard Coffee down on Portland Foreside."" Prentice was honored on the Mainebiz 40 Under 40 list in 2023. At Douro, Wyatt will be assisted by Pastry Chef Georgia Macon, while the interior will be designed in collaboration with Patrick Boothe, director of Woodhull Commercial Studio. The restaurant will offer European-influenced seafood with a large selection of wines by the glass, classic cocktails and non-alcoholic beverages. Ties between Portuguese and Maine aquaculture will be reflected in the menu, design and wine offerings, according to a spokeswoman for the Prentice Hospitality Group.

Rivet Staff Writer What will be the best uses for the Ham Complex now and into the future, and how much will it cost? Rec Director Gary Colello gave a snapshot of what the complex is and what it could be when he rolled out a Master Plan to the Bridgton Select Board at their Jan. 9 meeting. The Master Plan “sets for a vision for the future development and expansion of the Ham Complex.” Colello noted that the plan was developed by Viewshed — a landscape architectural, planning and GIS firm based in Yarmouth — along with oversight from the town’s Community Development Department and Recreation Department. Work spanned a four-month period from late summer to fall 2023. “Viewshed is the same firm that did our Open Space Plan, so they were already used to the town and used the data points that came in through the Open Space Plan. It was a natural good fit for them to continue their work with us,” Colello said. The group toured the facility, documented what currently exists and developed a list of amenities that could be developed. “Before we just started adding things to the complex, I thought it would be appropriate to get a full scope of what we could do up there,” Colello said. The group also looked at existing problems present at the complex, such as drainage issues on two playing fields and a “solar orientation” situation (the way Field 3 is positioned, as the sun sets in the spring and early summer, rays of light impair outfielders’ vision, which “is a dangerous situation for the ball players,” Colello pointed out). Field 4, especially, struggles with drainage. Bridgton hosted a major tournament this summer, and rain hit, soaking the fields. Field 4 failed to recover, but fortunately, games scheduled there were shifted to Junior Harmon Field. “If it wasn’t for Harmon Field, our tournament would have been canceled completely,” Colello said Viewshed developed three conceptual designs, which were reviewed by town staff. Using public comments received during Open Space Plan discussions, amenities such as pickle ball courts, walking trails and a rec center were added to the design. Considering feedback given, Viewshed proceeded to design two different Master Plans (see graphics and descriptions), which outlines additions and improvements, along with estimated costs. “I can assure you we have taken a look at different concepts,” Colello said. “Viewshed did a good job doing their homework.

MADISON, Wis. — U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, a key Republican congressman from Wisconsin who has spearheaded House pushback against the Chinese government, announced Saturday that he won’t run for a fifth term. The announcement comes just days after he angered his fellow Republicans by refusing to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., speaks to reporters after Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the GOP whip, dropped out of the speaker race, at the Capitol in Washington on Tuesday, Oct. 24. J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press file The GOP has been looking to oust Mayorkas as a way to punish the Biden administration over its handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. A House impeachment vote Tuesday fell just one vote short. Gallagher was one of three Republicans who opposed impeachment. His fellow Republicans surrounded him on the House floor in an attempt to change his mind, but he refused to change his vote. Record numbers of people have been arriving at the southern border as they flee countries around the globe. Many claim asylum and end up in U.S. cities that are ill-prepared to provide for them while they await court proceedings. The issue is a potent line of attack for Donald Trump as he works toward defeating President Biden in November’s elections. Gallagher wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published after the vote that impeachment wouldn’t stop migrants from crossing the border and would set a precedent that could be used against future Republican administrations. But the impeachment vote’s failure was a major setback for the GOP. Wisconsin Republicans began mulling this week whether Gallagher should face a primary challenger. Gallagher did not mention the impeachment vote in a statement announcing his retirement, saying only that he doesn’t want to grow old in Washington. “The Framers intended citizens to serve in Congress for a season and then return to their private lives,” Gallagher said. “Electoral politics was never supposed to be a career and, trust me, Congress is no place to grow old. And so, with a heavy heart, I have decided not to run for re-election.”Advertisement Voicemails that the Associated Press left at his offices in Washington and Wisconsin on Saturday weren’t immediately returned. Gallagher, a former Marine who grew up in Green Bay, has represented northeastern Wisconsin in Congress since 2017. He spent last year leading a new House committee dedicated to countering China. During the committee’s first hearing, he framed the competition between the U.S. and China as “an existential struggle over what life will look like in the 21st century.” Tensions between the two countries have been high for years, with both sides enacting tariffs on imports during Trump’s term as president. China’s opaque response to COVID-19, aggression toward Taiwan and the discovery of a possible spy balloon floating across the U.S. last year have only intensified lawmakers’ intent to do more to block the Chinese government. Chinese officials have lashed out at the committee, accusing its members of bias and maintaining a Cold War mentality. Gallagher was considering a run for U.S. Senate this year against incumbent Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin. But he abandoned the idea in June and said then that he wanted to focus on countering China through the committee. Success. Please wait for the page to reload.

The 82-year-old Democrat is a legendary figure who has been revered and reviled for his hardball tactics. First elected to the Maine House of Representatives in 1964, he was speaker for nearly 20 years until 1994 and has been in the Legislature for 54 years. He was the inspiration for a 1993 referendum that imposed term limits, something he has opposed. Martin, who left the House due to term limits in 2022, is running for the seat that is being vacated by Rep. Austin Theriault of Fort Kent, a former NASCAR driver who is seeking the Republican nomination for Maine’s 2nd Congressional District. Lucien Daigle of Fort Kent is the only Republican who has filed to run for the western Aroostook County district so far. Martin has found ways to control things out of his leadership position. He has recently been an influential member of the budget-writing committee. Martin was slowed by a 2021 head injury that required neurological surgery, but he quickly returned to Augusta to finish his term. He said he is running this time in part because of the “lack of continuity” that the Legislature has struggled with in the face of term limits. “I’ve been there long enough to know how the system works,” Martin said. Martin may be the most important state lawmaker in Maine history. He effectively wrote the modern rules that the Legislature operates under — from banning smoking in the House chamber to barring lobbyists from sitting at lawmakers’ desks. He is the reason why Maine has shoreland zoning, and he has directed an outsized share of state funds to his rural area. He has seen setbacks as well, most notably in 1994, after two of his aides were convicted in a ballot tampering scandal. While Martin was never implicated, it came on the heels of the term-limit referendum. He also lost a surprise 2012 election to former Rep. Mike Nadeau, a Republican from Fort Kent before winning the seat back. The former speaker said he feels good physically and wants to return to crafting the budget, demurring after being asked how long he wants to continue serving. “It depends on how long the good Lord will let me stay on this earth,” he said.
