'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': 'Nursing homes were not on our minds much before the COVID-19 pandemic. Then their residents began dying by the thousands. While there are no definitive figures, nursing home residents and staff appear to account for about one-third of the roughly 90,000 COVID-19 related deaths in the U.S., according to The New York Times. Those figures may be low because some states do not report such figures and the CDC is just beginning to collect them. The stunning death toll has brought scrutiny to an industry that many believe is due for an overhaul. Questions about the way it\'s paid for, staffing levels, adequate training for staff, effective regulations and oversight all are raging as states battle to control the ravages of the pandemic. ""There\'s lots of hubbub"" around nursing homes, says Dr. Louise Aronson, a geriatrician, professor of Medicine at UC San Francisco, and author of Pulitzer Prize finalist Elderhood. And it\'s important, she says, that the public keep that focus. ""The way we\'ve created nursing homes,"" she says, ""they\'re so separate from real life that it\'s altogether too easy for people to go back to their lives and just kind of forget about it and not make a difference."" There have long been ideas among people who study nursing homes — or work in them — for ways to make them safer and more humane. Before the pandemic, these ideas weren\'t of much interest to anyone outside the field. But those proposed innovations are now attracting a wider audience. What first drew that wider audience was the shocking speed with which the coronavirus tore through nursing homes. But slowly, they\'re learning that nursing homes struggled with infection control long before the coronavirus came around. It\'s the most frequently cited deficiency by health inspectors. Annually, well over a million nursing home residents contract infections and as many as 388,000 die from them. Even after the pandemic began, nursing home inspectors found that one-third of nurses and nursing assistants did not wash their hands properly and a quarter were using personal protective equipment (PPE) incorrectly. But nursing homes haven\'t had to worry about inspectors citing them for those failings, says Charlene Harrington, a professor of Nursing and Sociology at the University of California San Francisco. ""The fines are so small that they don\'t really have an impact on the nursing home,"" she says. ""It\'s just the cost of doing business."" The pandemic exposed the weaknesses of the nursing home system. Facilities were short of PPE. Tales abounded of nursing home staff wearing rain ponchos and goggles from hardware stores because they couldn\'t get proper gowns and face shields. Yet, the federal government only began providing supplies this month, and it\'s not much: FEMA says it will send two shipments, each containing a one week supply of PPE, to every nursing home in the country by July 4. Nursing homes also have not been a priority for testing, which is a key step to catching infections before they can spread. In a recent phone call with state governors, Vice President Mike Pence encouraged them to see that all nursing home residents and staff were tested for the coronavirus, but the Trump administration is not mandating this. Yet, despite nursing homes overwhelming number of cases and deaths, obtaining tests has remained a struggle. ""Do I feel that sometimes maybe nursing homes get the short shrift of things?"" asks Daniel Ruth, president and CEO of the San Francisco Campus for Jewish Living, which includes a skilled nursing facility. ""The answer is \'yes.\' Our acute hospital partners have a much louder voice for advocacy."" But now that nursing homes have the public\'s attention, the industry is pushing for more support. The American Health Care Association and the affiliated National Center for Assisted Living have asked Congress and the Trump administration for $10 billion. They say the money will be used for additional staff, hazard pay, and to make up for the losses they\'ve taken due to their inability to admit new patients during the COVID-19 crisis. ""The truth is that nursing homes have not failed America. The public health system has failed nursing homes,"" said Mark Parkinson, president and chief executive officer of the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, in a column by the Morning Consult. ""Long-term care facilities are doing everything possible to stop the spread of this virus. But we need help."" The two trade organizations commissioned a survey showing overwhelming numbers of voters think that nursing homes deserve more financial support from the federal government. More financial support could come with a price. Congressional Democrats have introduced legislation that would create new requirements for nursing homes in staffing, infection control, and quality of life for residents. Long-time nursing home analysts offer some other innovative ideas. Smaller is better ""I\'ve been teaching nursing homes and studying this area for 20 plus years,"" says David Grabowski, professor of Health Care Policy at Harvard School. ""I\'m still waiting for the individual that wants to go to a nursing home; that person probably isn\'t out there."" Grabowski says that\'s in part because the facilities value the needs of the institution over the needs of the individuals who make their homes there. ""I would really think about smaller home environments where we value the caregivers and we value the residents,"" Grabowski says. He imagines houses with just eight to 12 residents living together. ""I think in general, we\'ve had way too much focus in terms of regulation on quality of care and not enough on the quality of life in these homes."" Limiting occupancy can also help control the spread of infection, says Daniel Ruth, CEO and president of the San Francisco Campus for Jewish Living. ""I absolutely believe that all rooms should be single rooms,"" Ruth says, as are almost all rooms at the Jewish Home, as the nursing facility on the campus is known. Currently, many nursing homes house residents two or three or even four to a room, all sharing one bathroom, making it easier for infections to spread. Change the inspection system One way to improve residents\' quality of life, Grabowski says, would be revamping the inspection system. ""Unfortunately, we\'ve been much more about identifying problems than we have been about working with facilities to help solve those problems,"" he says. Right now, inspection is handled by one state bureaucracy and quality improvement by another. He\'d like to see them combined. ""Imagine I\'m a surveyor right now, going into a nursing home to look at their infection control. If I see a problem with the way the staff is using the personal protective equipment,"" Grabowski says, ""I can write that down on a sheet of paper and take that back and say there were problems. [Or] I could help them immediately start to fix that."" AHCA President Mark Parkinson agrees that ""the survey system is broken."" In a conference call last month with reporters, Parkinson said that it ""focuses on too many things,"" making it hard to prioritize. He calls the system ""punitive"" and ""combative."" Parkinson says he hopes to sit down with stakeholders when the pandemic is over ""and figure out a better way."" Professor Charlene Harrington of the University of California, San Francisco, says a ""better way"" would be to refocus the inspection system on the fundamental problem of nursing homes, which she says is inadequate staffing. Nursing assistants, she says, are ""running from one resident to the other without hand washing,"" which she says is one of the main reasons that nursing homes are so often cited for poor infection control. So many of the citations that nursing homes receive — from poor infection control, to patients with bed sores, to nutrition problems — can all be traced back to insufficient staff, says Harrington, but it\'s something they\'re almost never cited for directly. Harrington blames nursing home owners for the low staff levels. ""Over 70% of nursing homes are for-profit,"" she says, contending they reduce staff to lower their costs. ""That\'s the primary way that for-profit companies can save money."" But Grabowski thinks the major reason that nursing homes don\'t have enough staff is Medicaid. It pays the bills for most nursing home residents, but it doesn\'t pay much. Nursing homes can barely break even on a Medicaid resident. ""There\'s under-investment in care generally and in staff in particular,"" Grabowski says. ""And why can\'t we pay more for these services and value the people that provide care for all of us in these settings? You know, we\'re getting what we pay for right now. And it\'s unfortunately not a very good outcome."" Re-think ownership There might be better outcomes if most nursing homes weren\'t designed to make money, says Daniel Ruth of the Jewish Home. ""If I was the king of the world, there would be a much greater proportion of nursing homes run by not-for-profits."" Ruth says the Jewish Home\'s nonprofit status made it easier for him to do something that other facilities have'}]"

(WALA) - More than two decades ago, Hurricane Mitch wrecked Honduras. Then, a contract dispute wrecked a Mobile company hired to help the Central American nation rebuild. On Thursday, a federal judge in Mobile will hear arguments over a whistleblower lawsuit alleging that Honduras – with the acquiescence of some U.S. government officials – defrauded American taxpayers. “The United States is refusing to enforce its treaty with Honduras,” said Murray Farmer, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. “And it’s teaching the Hondurans that it’s OK to steal from Americans. And that’s not right.” The lawsuit is the latest in a long line of litigation that has bounced around the courts in both countries over more than a decade. It stems from a $17.7 million contract that Mobile-based DRC Inc. won in 2001 to build 22 water and sewer systems in a country struggling with longstanding poverty and the aftermath of a storm that claimed 7,000 lives there. But when it came time for DRC to collect, Honduras refused to pay. The company lost a long legal battle and never recovered. “Oh, the company was over. We lost everything,” said Farmer, who was the company’s project manager in Honduras, overseeing all spending. “The company was broken up and sold in pieces. We used to have an office here on Museum Drive with almost 300 employees, and we lost everything. It was sold for pennies on the dollar.” Famer and DRC came under suspicion that they had paid a bribe to win the contract. Farmer told FOX10 News that he believes a losing competitor might have leveled the allegation, and he added that it probably prompted the Honduran government to withhold payment initially. The U.S. Agency for International Development, which gave hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Honduras, took the bribery allegations seriously. Farmer said federal investigators subjected him to 22 audits in five years and three criminal referrals. One of those included a search warrant. “They took the pictures of my kids off my desk,” he said. Still, no payment All that scrutiny failed to turn up any evidence of wrongdoing, however, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Mobile in 2007 sent Farmer’s lawyer a letter clearing him. Still, though, Honduras would not honor the contract. So, DRC pressed its case before an arbitration panel in that country. In 2009, that panel sided with DRC and ordered the Honduran government to pay more than $51 million. But then Honduras shifted tactics, arguing that the Honduran Social Investment Fund – the agency that DRC contracted with – was not a government agency but a separate legal entity. The U.S. Department of Justice agrees, comparing it to quasi-independent agencies in the United States that are not under the direct control of the executive branch, like the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Honduran Supreme Court in 2013 sided with the government, ruling that it did not have to enforce the arbitration order. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., cited that decision in 2014 in ruling against DRC in a lawsuit against Honduras. That finding is the central issue the whistleblower suit Farmer and two others filed in 2017. If the Honduran Social Investment Fund isn’t a government agency, they argue, then it was illegal for the Honduran government to certify that it was all those years that it was receiving U.S. aid. Farmer filed the suit under a law that encourages citizens to expose fraud against the government. Farmer argues the conduct of Honduras not only hurt his company but defrauded American taxpayers since the U.S. government financed the hurricane relief efforts through economic aid. If successful, the plaintiffs would get a share of any damages ordered by the court. But Farmer, who now works as a real estate developer, said that is not his motivation. “This is not about money,” he said. “I couldn’t care less about the money. … The best thing I can do is pray this doesn’t happen to somebody else and to fight as hard as I can for the truth, and to make sure it doesn’t happen again.” U.S. takes Honduras’ side Even though the federal government stands to benefit if the suit succeeds, however, it had taken the side of Honduras. The Department of Justice has asked Chief U.S. District Judge Kristi DuBose to throw out the suit. Government lawyers argued in a recent court filing that the allegations “lack merit” and that the facts “do not support” the claims. Jay Majors, a trial attorney for the Justice Department, wrote that USAID has determined that the Honduran Social Investment Fund was legally eligible to receive U.S. assistance even though it was separate from the Honduran government. “The United States investigated the allegations,” Majors wrote. “The facts do not support … claims here.” The Justice Department also raised concerns of international relations. Proceeding, the government argues, could have “negative effects upon the diplomatic relationship between the United States and Honduras.” That rationale drew scorn from John McAvoy, a retired U.S. government employee who oversaw the DRC contract for the U.S. government. He said it is “corrupt” that for the sake of relations with Honduras, the U.S. government would side against citizens from its own country. “To me, that’s the ultimate deep state, swamp corruption, where the Department of Justice knows for a fact that there has been a false claim in the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars,” said McAvoy, who is also a plaintiff in the whistleblower suit. Farmer express particular resentment over a decision in 2006 by USAID to “decommit” almost $2.8 million in aid to Honduras – money the Mobile man says should have gone toward the DRC contract – and allow $100,000 of it to be used to cover the legal defense of the Honduran Social Investment Fund “I feel betrayed by my government,” he said. McAvoy, a 26-year veteran of the federal government, said U.S. policy encourages corruption in Central America. He pointed to an October conviction in New York of Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández, the brother of current Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, on cocaine trafficking charges. The president has not been charged with a crime, but federal prosecutors in New York have referred to him as a “co-conspirator” in court filings, accusing him of using drug money to help win elections in 2013 and 2017. “This is the person that we have to protect so that he won’t get mad at us diplomatically?” McAvoy said. He criticized the Justice Department for not even bothering to try to prove the assertion that siding with an American company would harm relations. “To me, it’s a lie,” he said. “It’s the deep state and the swamp protecting their own interests. And they don’t care about the U.S. taxpayer. They don’t care about the money. It’s not their money. It’s play money to these government bureaucrats.” Copyright 2019 WALA. All rights reserved.'}]"
