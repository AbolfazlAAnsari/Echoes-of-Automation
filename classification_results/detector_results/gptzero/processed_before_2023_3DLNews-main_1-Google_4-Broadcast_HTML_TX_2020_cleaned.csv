Borden In recent weeks West Texas has seen a drop in the number of people being hospitalized with COVID-19. At the same time, hospitals in the Midland-Odessa area have received doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and have already begun vaccinating employees. Marfa Public Radio's Ari Snider caught up with Permian Basin reporter Mitch Borden to talk about these new developments. Below is an excerpt of the conversation between Marfa Public Radio's Ari Snider and Permian Basin reporter Mitch Borden. To listen to the full conversation click the audio player at the top of the page. AS: So can you go into some more detail about the drop in COVID hospitalizations and how this has affected Far West Texas? MB: Yeah, and to do that we have to go back to November. So, starting around Thanksgiving, the state had to renew some of its coronavirus restrictions in our area. That was because over 15% of all hospital beds and Trauma Service Area J, which includes the Permian Basin and Big Bend, were taken up by coronavirus patients [for over a week.] This activated one of Governor Greg Abbott executive orders causing some businesses like bars to close and other businesses to lower the number of customers they could serve to half of their capacity. AS: Yeah, I'm sure many of our listeners do remember this. That move brought down business capacity from 75% to 50% right? MB: Yeah, at the time, these new restrictions and the high hospital numbers were not good news and many people expected another surge in coronavirus patients following the Thanksgiving holiday when it was believed families would gather. Thankfully that surge never really appeared, at least in the Midland-Odessa area. Since hospitals have seen a sustained drop in hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients recently, the state has lifted the restrictions placed on the Big Bend and the Permian Basin. AS: With two COVID-19 vaccines being approved by the FDA, we are starting to see hospitals across Texas receive these first doses. What's the status of the vaccine getting to the Odessa-Midland area? MB: This is actually some great news. All the hospitals in Midland and Odessa, all three, have received one of the two vaccines that are currently approved by the U.S. government. Midland Memorial Hospital received its first shipment last week which was made up of the Pfizer vaccine. Odessa's Medical Center Hospital and Odessa Regional Medical Center just received shipments of the Moderna vaccine. Both facilities are moving fast to get out as many shots to their health care workers as possible. AS: Is there any talk about getting the vaccines out to some of the smaller communities? MB: Yeah, Medical Center hospital set aside over 100 doses for rural hospitals and in a few surrounding communities including Monahans, Kermit and Pecos. Both Midland Memorial and Medical Center have said they're committed to getting the vaccine out to other health care providers. Looking at the Big Bend, health officials in the tri-county area expect the state will soon send around 400 doses of the vaccine to clinics located throughout the region. AS: So we're talking about vaccines right now. And I just want to be clear about who's receiving them at this point. You can't just waltz into the hospital and get a vaccine, right? MB: No, sadly not. The vaccines I've been talking about right now are specifically for healthcare and frontline workers. At this point, like you said Ari, the vaccine isn't available to the general public in West Texas. Health care officials are asking the public to be patient and just to pay attention for more information as the state continues to dispense the vaccine.""}]"

But for many small business owners, that glimmer of hope was quickly tapered by a reminder of their own experiences. After weeks of wringing their options dry as they tried to secure a loan at the same time as 1.6 million other companies, many eventually lost the race against time and watched the $349 billion program dry up. On Monday morning, the Small Business Administration will again start to accept applications for PPP loans, which can be forgiven after eight weeks as long as businesses use the money to keep employees on payroll and pay utilities. This time around, experts say the $310 billion is expected to run out even quicker than before, as nearly 1 million applications sit idle, having missed out on the last round. Nick Ponton, who owns a fashion production company in Manhattan, is one of the million. Most of his business is fashion shows and photo shoots, neither of which are happening at the moment. Instead, Ponton has linked up with others in the fashion industry to make and deliver cloth masks to hospitals. It’s helped to keep his mind off of PPP, he said, and to remind him what others are going through on the front lines. But time is running out for his business. If he doesn’t receive a loan by May 1, he plans to furlough himself and his one employee. Whatever “gas is left in the tank” will go toward his employee’s health insurance, he said, adding, “I’m not going to leave her without health insurance during a pandemic.” For much of the last month, Ponton has searched high and low to find a bank that would process his application. He initially went to his own bank, Bank of America, but was told they were only able to review applications from customers that already had lines of credit open. The experience left him furious, Ponton said. “We have played by the rules for a decade and the once in a million times that we need this … you’re told that your healthy business can’t be serviced, because they’re only giving money to people that owe them money,” Ponton said. Then, after watching billions of dollars drain from the program every day, Ponton tried something new — something he doesn’t, in hindsight, recommend. “That desperation, or that sense of urgency, is why I found myself having sent my tax returns and confidential financial information to a bank I’d never heard of, in Florida, over the internet, via a recommendation on Twitter,” Ponton said. He panicked, eventually pulling his application, and finally successfully submitted another application with First Republic, a smaller bank that caters to a high-income clientele. On Friday, he got assigned a number in the queue: 361,426. Still, Ponton feels lucky. As a middle-aged white male, he acknowledged that he likely has had a far easier time than minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses or businesses run by non-English speakers — all of which statistically have less capital and face systemic challenges. “It just made me realize there are so many other small businesses who need this help who don’t have access to the system to get it,” Ponton said. Ponton is relatively lucky despite not actually receiving any financial help from the government just yet. Others, like Brooklyn, New York, restaurant owners Debbie and Kevin Adey, have waited about two weeks without any word from their bank, Chase. Kevin, the chef at their Italian restaurant, Faro, and Debbie, who runs the business side, opened up shop five years ago — their first restaurant together. They let go of their entire staff of 26 on March 16, when New York City shut down all of its bars and restaurants. Some of their employees have since left the city, the Adeys said. Many are on unemployment. For others, it’s worse. Some aren’t responding, perhaps because they’re no longer able to afford to pay their phone bills, Debbie said. “Unfortunately, I had somebody ask me to sleep in the restaurant,” she said. She wasn’t able to say yes. “I just can’t get involved in that, you know? It breaks my heart, but I just can’t go there,” she said. “But that’s tough. That weighs heavy, they’re like family.” As they wait, the Adeys find it hard to see how a “new normal” will work for the restaurant industry. So far, it’s been that fear of the unknown that has kept the Adey’s from trying curbside pick-up or delivery, they said. “It’s so easy to infect other people, even if you’re not showing symptoms. I just can’t imagine trying to explain to somebody’s kid [who got infected] — it was what I had to do, you know, we had to go in and make the pasta,” Kevin Adey said. On the other side of Manhattan, Andrew Zebrowski has felt the reverberations from the hits taken by his colleagues in the restaurant industry. For Zebrowski, a co-founder of the two-year-old Hoboken Brewing Company, they’re his biggest clients. He estimated his company is currently making about 15% of the profits it made last year.

County Public Health Department Health Director Annette Rodriguez, and 21 of those cases are Nueces county residents. Theses number reflect new information provided to KRIS 6 News on Tuesday night. ORIGINAL: Nueces County reported a one-day high-record 27 new confirmed COVID-19 cases Tuesday. City Manager Peter Zanoni said 25 of those cases came from STX Beef early Tuesday, one of two clusters in the city. Officials hope to prevent those clusters from becoming a full-blown outbreak. The other cluster is at the Dismas Ministries halfway house, where 18 residents and staff have tested positive for the coronavirus. Three of those infected residents also worked at STX Beef. “We may see another bIg number tomorrow,” said Peter Zanoni. “They did testing Sunday and Monday, so far we’ve got the Monday results, we’re still waiting on the Sunday results from the National Guard.” The National Guard and health department tested more than 700 STX Beef employees. Those who test positive are put into a 14 day quarantine. The city is looking for ways to keep those quarantined away from others. “We’re going to help them stay home,” said Zanoni. “We’re gong to check to see how financially, either through federal dollars or our own local dollars, we can pay them to stay home, help them with services to include food.” However, several positive tests are likely asymptomatic cases. So is quarantine too little too late to prevent the virus from spreading? Zanoni believes the clusters were caught in time. “We’re going to have to take it one day at a time,” said Zanoni. “Right now we’ve identified them, containing them and isolating them is step two, we hope those two measures will work.” If they don’t work, Zanoni says there are currently no plans to go back to a stay-at-home scenario, though that could change. “At this point, we really haven’t talk about that much with the policy makers,” said Zanoni. “That starts with the governor, the county judge, the mayor, we’ll have to see.” The only ways STX Beef would shut down is if the plant didn’t have enough workers to operate it, or if the infection level grew out of control. So far, neither scenario has happened.""}]"

Four-year-old Maraiha made the news last Halloween when she asked for candy.

Maraiha was diagnosed at 18 months, and beat the disease, but when it returned last September, doctors gave her only six months to live. The viewing for Maraiha is Friday from 6 to 8 p.m. at McCoy funeral home. The funeral will take place Saturday at 10 a.m. at Methodist Church, followed by burial at the Roscoe Cemetery.

AMARILLO, Texas (KAMR/KCIT) — Attorney Jesse Quackenbush, owner of “Big Beaners” restaurant in Amarillo is defending the name of his establishment after some people have said it is a derogatory term. In the video above you can see the name of the restaurant on the sign. Quackenbush said the name originated with the Latin American beans they sell at the store. “We knew that we were going to sell specialty bean dishes from Latin America so we wanted something that would connect our main product which is breakfast burritos and specialty bean dishes with coffee,” said Quackenbush. Quackenbush explained many people think there is nothing wrong with the name. He said some members of the community have reached out to him. Quackenbush also told us about an interaction he had with the Amarillo Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the Local League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) over the name of the restaurant. “I was called by Abel Vasquez [president of Amarillo chapter of LULAC],” said Quackenbush. “I started to get a lecture about what LULAC did to the Frito-Lay Corporation because of Frito Bandito back in the 1960s and 1970s. That basically was his attempt to strong-arm me with a veiled threat of litigation to ruin my business, and I told him that he and whomever else he represented can go f*** themselves and go to Starbucks if they don’t like my business.” We were able to also speak to Bosquez about his thoughts on the restaurant’s name. “Sometimes I come across it. When they say ‘beaner,’ they’re talking about Mexicans,” said Bosquez. “A call [complaining about the restaurant] that I received, the person said, ‘It’s offensive because they are talking about Mexicans as ‘beaners.”” Bosquez said it is not only the name that is offensive. He said the logo is also offensive to Mexican-Americans. Quackenbush rebutted by explaining that if people took the time to look at the sign and look at the restaurant’s menu, there should be no confusion on the meaning of the name. When we asked if Quackenbush had any plans of changing the name, he said, “If I would have been approached nicely by LULAC, if I would have been approached nicely by the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce instead of threateningly. In other words, threatening to strong-arm me into something different, I might have reconsidered.” We did reach out to the Amarillo Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (AHCC) on Thursday, but they were unavailable for comment. Friday, the AHCC released a statement. Read the full statement below: Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Kevin Harris , a father of four, is currently at Mercy Health St. Joseph Warren Hospital. He was admitted Sunday and tested positive for the coronavirus Wednesday. “At first I felt like I was going to die but now it’s slowly getting better,” Harris said. He told the Fox 8 I-Team that Friday he finally was able to sleep through the night. Harris posted a video on his social media page Friday night showing himself in his hospital bed and a hospital worker next to his bed wearing protective gear. “I had to wait and make sure I wasn’t going to die before I was on Facebook,” Harris says on the video. “ I am not out of the woods but I am better.” He says he is very grateful to the hospital staff that has helped him. Harris said he has not recently traveled outside of the country. He said the farthest he went was Cleveland in late February, when he had a doctor’s appointment for an unrelated matter. “When I started feeling sick I went to the doctor’s near my home and they said I had the flu,” Harris said. He added his main symptoms were a fever, shortness of breath and fatigue. He said a few days later he started coughing and that cough kept getting worse. A friend stopped at his home to make him soup, even though he told her not to. He said on Sunday another friend came to take him to the hospital. “I had very limited contact with anyone,” Harris said. He wanted to stress to others to stay home if they are sick so they don’t spread any illness and if their symptoms don’t get better in a couple of days to go to the hospital. “This is not your typical flu,” Harris said. “It’s bad.” Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.
