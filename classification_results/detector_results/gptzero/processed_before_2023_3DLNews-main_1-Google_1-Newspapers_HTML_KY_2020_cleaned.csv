expected) unexpected weather on the first Saturday in May. But we never published that issue as planned because, two weeks after the shoot, something else unexpected upended our lives. On Feb. 28, 2020, a team and I entered the Highlands photo studio of Steve Squall, rolling racks laden with garment bags stuffed with spring fashions, hat boxes filled with feathery fascinators, and a beat-up stylist’s kit containing the usual clamps, pins and lint rollers — but, also, more notably, a big pump bottle of Purell. At the time — about two weeks before the pandemic shut down our city and much of the world — we were teetering on the brink of an altered reality. We just didn’t exactly know it yet. Most of us still believed we would be going to the Derby, not realizing the pandemic would postpone the race to the first Saturday in September, with no fans in the ghostly stands. We entered the studio armed with faltering optimism and some of the most beautiful clothes I could corral. My Derby season, like many people’s in this city, had begun in early January. I was planning the shoot for the magazine and also the Kentucky Derby Festival fashion show, which I was creative-directing for the tenth year. The show, which was traditionally staged at the casino in Southern Indiana for an audience of a thousand people, was scheduled for the end of March. The show’s choreographer, Chris Kaufman, and I were having increasingly existential text chats. His slightly quirky interest in epidemiology suddenly gave him the air of a punk savant as we began questioning the wisdom of cramming 33 models into the tight backstage quarters at the casino for a packed house. We were starting to float some shared anxiety and a sense of responsibility for everybody’s well-being, but were unsure of where to land on it. On that day in Steve’s studio, though, our crew was smaller, the room bigger and the significance of this virus still seemed more limited to cruise ships and maybe subways. I didn’t want to be an alarmist. Spraying down groceries, wearing masks — at that moment, these measures still seemed like surreal figments from a dystopic movie. But as I packed for the shoot, I threw in the Purell at the last minute, figuring it couldn’t hurt. We spent eight hours styling models spaced as far apart as possible in the dressing area and executing a weirdly prescient theme: preparing for the unexpected and the extreme. (Weather, but still.) Squall and his assistant, Shepherd Ahlers, conjured rain, gale-force wind, harsh sunlight and even snow — sparkling flakes purchased by the bucket at Michaels. (The 1989 Derby did see frozen precipitation.) Models emoted and posed for the impending perils. At the time, it seemed like an edgy juxtaposition: beauty and color pitted against unforeseen foes. We spent the day battling imaginary dangers, oblivious to those we didn’t see coming. A year later, I look at the photos, remembering time in a bubble just moments before it burst. That photo shoot — like the many, many others I’ve had the luxury of living through — was an immersive experience of bliss and color and creative energy. It was a temporary cocoon in which a bunch of people who share the inexplicable urge to conjure up something beautiful came together and did just that. Revisiting the images now, they seem eerily prophetic, from a moment before life changed for all of us. So many of the months that followed felt so gray and slow and surreal. We watched too much of the vibrancy and life drain from our existence. I struggled to remain optimistic as one opportunity after another — an editor job I was eagerly anticipating, the dream internship my daughter had begun at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the college graduation-slash-family reunion we had optimistically planned in upstate New York — faded away. We watched bits of our lives slip through our fingers, then gradually adjusted our grip to grab onto what really matters. For me, it was a reminder that what means the most to me — beyond family and friends, of course — is the ability to connect or move people through stories and images. The photos still look stunning. But their beauty and meaning have changed. — Christine Fellingham Jenny Pfanensteil, milliner and owner of Formé Millinery What do you feel when you look at these photos now? “It is as if they were predicting what was about to come. Seeing the dark shadow behind the models almost looks like an entity about to strike. Some of the models look like they are being cautious and are unsure about their surroundings and are about to run. Others seem they are trying to be brave and stand against what they see in front of them.” Steve Squall, photographer Do you remember your thoughts about Covid the day of the shoot? “I was very nervous. I remember texting just a day or two before the shoot to ask if we were still going to do it or not.” How did your life change in the weeks and months after the shoot? “Well, I used to have money in savings and a pretty regular amount of work. Over the past year, though, I exhausted the savings. I turned to unemployment until that ran out. I had to move out of the studio we shot this editorial in, and I increased the amount of time that I spend at my second job as a bartender at Tim Faulkner Gallery. So work has been a little rough.” Have your priorities changed over the past year or so? “I think I have developed a much more tightly knit group of close friends over the past year, and I’ve learned the value of letting go of that which you do not truly need.” Have your views on fashion changed? “They haven’t. I have always loved shooting fashion images, but I have very little interest in it otherwise. I wear almost the same outfit every day — jeans and a T-shirt.” How has the past year changed you? “There’s this George Carlin quote: ‘Think of how stupid the average person is. Then realize half of them are stupider than that.’ I used to think that was really funny. But the past year made me realize how true it is, and I’ve become a bit more cynical than I used to be.” Kris Stein, model Do you remember your thoughts about Covid the day of the shoot? “I wasn’t nervous, nor did Covid have my attention.” How did your life change in the weeks and months after the shoot? “For me it was difficult. First day out of quarantine, I was heading to work at Amazon in Jeffersonville and a truck T-boned me, totaling my car. The protest struck me harder because knowing Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend since childhood, and knowing neither one of them deserved the long-lasting pain (her death) has caused the world, made me cry a lot. No one deserves to lose their life from police violence. As a Black male with a criminal justice degree, I know our city has a corrupt system. Believe it now or you’ll forever be oblivious.” Have your priorities changed over the past year or so? “Big time! I will never be a cop in Louisville. My spiritual awareness was awakened during the pandemic and I see things a lot differently now. As a human on this Earth at this time, I will make sure to take action. My voice will be heard when it’s time. “I’ve become aware. I’ve opened my eyes and I’ve opened my ears and my heart has been shattered. I’m growing and learning that the world is no fairytale land.

Log In State-Journal.com’s comments forum is for civil, constructive dialogue about news topics in our community, state, nation and world. We emphasize “civil” at a time when Americans, in the words of the current president, need to “turn down the temperature” of political debates. The State Journal will do its part by more carefully policing this forum. Here are some rules that all commenters must agree to follow: Absolutely no attacks on other commenters, on guest columnists or on authors of letters to the editor. Our print and online opinion pages are sacred marketplaces of ideas where diverse viewpoints are welcome without fear of retribution. You may constructively critique the ideas and opinions of others, but name-calling, stereotyping and similar attacks are strictly prohibited. Leeway will be given for criticism of elected officials and other public figures, but civility is essential. If you focus your criticism on ideas, opinions and viewpoints, you will be less likely to run afoul of our commenting rules. Keep comments focused on the article or commentary in question. Don’t use an article about the Frankfort City Commission, for example, to rant about national politics. Hyperpartisanship that suggests anyone on the other side of an issue or anyone in a particular particular party is evil is not welcome. If you believe that all Democrats are socialists intent on destroying America or that all Republicans are racists, there are lots of places on the internet for you to espouse those views. State-Journal.com is not one. No sophomoric banter. This isn’t a third-grade classroom but rather a place for serious consumers of news to offer their reactions and opinions on news stories and published commentary. No consumer complaints about individual businesses. If you’ve had a bad experience with a private business or organization, contact the Better Business Bureau or the government agency that regulates that business. If you believe the actions of a private business are newsworthy, contact us at news@state-journal.com and we will consider whether news coverage is merited. Absolutely no jokes or comments about a person’s physical appearance. No promotion of commercial goods or services. Our outstanding staff of marketing consultants stands ready to help businesses with effective advertising solutions. If you state facts that have not been previously reported by The State Journal, be sure to include the source of your information. No attacks on State Journal staff members or contributing writers. We welcome questions about, and criticism of, our news stories and commentary but not of the writers who work tirelessly to keep their community informed. Corrections of inaccurate information in news stories should be sent to news@state-journal.com rather than posted in the comments section.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:30 pm Social media has become increasingly popular in recent years. Popular sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter attract millions of people to their platforms. In an age where technology is dominant, it is important to note social media’s role in transforming how individuals get their news and the impact that social media has during election seasons. In a 2019 study by the Pew Research Center, 48 percent of US adults aged 18-29 get their news from social media. Of those individuals, 58 percent are women. The study also shows older groups of people still rely on TV and news websites to obtain their news. In recent months, social media has started showing advertisements and links to information regarding voter registration and the 2020 election. Personally, I have seen links and posts on Instagram asking if I am registered to vote. By making a pop-up appear on each person’s page when they enter the Instagram app, users are reminded about the election and registering to vote. The role of social media in elections is growing and evolving. For many people, during the pandemic, our main way of obtaining information has been through social media. Candidates have used social media for years as a means of campaigning but this year it is even more prevalent. Candidates can use social media to show aspects of their personal life in a way that doesn’t get portrayed on TV and during debates while communicating directly with voters. Plus, voters can show their support and talk to candidates without having to donate financially to the campaign. Twitter is a popular site for political information to spread. President Trump has 87.3 million followers and Joe Biden has 11.5 million followers currently. With one tweet, a candidate can be thrown into the spotlight and either criticized or praised by other users. In recent weeks, a tweet emerged showing a video of Joe Biden comforting the son of a man killed in the Parkland school shooting in 2018. Twitter users replied with warm messages of how sincere Biden was and how that is the kind of president our country needs in charge. With any social media site, the validity of information is a concern. During the election season, information is being introduced daily and discerning what is true and what is false is difficult. When users spread misinformation without realizing it, it causes those who view the information to be misinformed and form opinions that aren’t correct. Fake news is always prevalent, but people retweet or reshare posts without doing the research to know if it is fake. To combat this, projects such as the News Literacy Project and the Open Mind Legacy Project are releasing public service announcements to suppress bots, trolls, and other pieces and sources of misinformation. Sites like Instagram and Facebook also alert users if a post may contain false information, and some ads are blocked from Facebook altogether. Social media is also dangerous during elections because individuals who post their political opinions may negatively try to influence the decisions of others. Forming our own opinions on candidates is difficult when Facebook is telling us how to feel on issues, and having a different opinion than someone else starts a feud on the Internet. Each time I get on Twitter, I can’t scroll very far without seeing a tweet about President Trump. On Instagram, I get sponsored ads for Amy McGrath and people I follow post political images and statements to their stories daily. With information and opinions constantly being pushed at us, staying grounded in our own opinions and remaining unswayed is daunting. Aside from candidate usage and the spread of information, social media has become a place of advocacy for voting among recognizable figures in society. Athletes have taken to their personal social media pages to advocate for voting and express their opinions. Celebrities have done the same thing in pushing for eligible citizens to make their voices heard through voting. The NBA, for instance, created advertisements encouraging people to vote. I have seen more ads this year urging people to register to vote than I have in my whole life. The Constitution gives us the right to vote and it is our duty as citizens to take part in elections. Social media is pivotal in sparking conversations on voting and elections. Discussions go beyond who is running and why each candidate deserves to be elected. Social media is giving a voice to citizens and creates a space where ideas can be quickly spread. There will always be critics of social media, but without it, I don’t think this election would have the same results. With all the good and the bad, social media is changing the way we view elections and I anticipate the role of social media will only continue to grow in future elections. Log In Keep it Clean.

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 5:46 pm Dillan Combs Staff Writer File photo Former Gov. Matt Bevin was a big story maker for 2019 as he had Vice President Mike Pence help him on the campaign trail, lost in the 2019 election and then made over 600 pardons. Above, Bevin shakes hands with one of the military personnel participating in the IRT program, while Vice President Mike Pence looks on during a visit to Manchester in August. 2019 was an eventful year for not only Laurel County residents, but Kentucky as a whole. London enjoyed industrial development and locals making national television. However, the city was rocked by shocking crime and crashes. In reviewing the year, the following are the top stories and topics that readers viewed on www.sentinel-echo.com in 2019 and created the most discussion on social media and in the community. BEVIN Kentucky as a whole ended 2019 with a significant change -- the defeat of former Gov. Matt Bevin by Andy Beshear. The election was hard-fought, with Beshear coming through with less than a percent over Bevin. Beshear won over 49.2 percent of voters, topping Bevin\'s 48.8 percent -- 709,890 votes to 704,754. The governor\'s election saw Vice President Mike Pence visit London to endorse Bevin. Glenna Bevin, Matt Bevin\'s wife, also attended the city during a Women\'s Republican Club meeting. Bevin\'s defeat quickly made way for controversy, with the former governor\'s last actions being the pardons of more than 600 inmates. Some of these pardons included a handful of convicted murderers. One such individual who was pardoned was Justin Wibbels, who was convicted after colliding head-on with a van in an emergency lane on KY-30 in Laurel County in 2014. There was also the pardon of London\'s Patrick Baker. He had been convicted of reckless homicide in the death of Donald Mills in Knox County after breaking into Mills\' home in the guise of a police officer. He along with four others had been convicted of the crimes that evening, two are still serving their sentences. Baker\'s pardon also came under speculation as reports showed Baker\'s family and family-friends, like local businessman Terry Forcht, had donated to Bevin\'s campaign and also asked for Bevin to pardon Baker on multiple occasions. Another local pardon was that of former Laurel County school official Charles Douglas Phelps. Phelps pleaded guilty in 2013 to possession of child pornography. Following his acquittal, Phelps was removed from the sex offender registration. FATAL CRASHES There were nine vehicular deaths in 2019 - the lowest since 2015. Eight of the nine persons who lost their lives were from London. The sole out-of-towner was a 17-year-old woman from Barbourville who died when the UTV of which she was a passenger flipped. The sole double fatality of the year occurred on July 1, 2019, in which a Laurel County educator lost her life. Jamie Gilliam, 38, of London, was driving along Old Way Road when a vehicle driven by 21-year-old James Dylan Johnson, also of London, topped a hill and hit Gilliam\'s vehicle head-on. Both Gilliam and Johnson died from the scene, while Gilliam\'s husband and three children also suffered serious injuries. Gilliam had served as a teacher at Bush Elementary and was principal of Johnson Elementary. On the day of her death, she had just completed her first day as Director of Pupil Personnel with the Laurel County school district. CRIME The county also faced a handful of crimes committed during the past year. One particular incident was the torture and death of a dog in East Bernstadt. Noah Blevins, David Griffith and Toby Glen Harrison, along with a minor, are all facings charges for the incident after a social media video circulated online showing one male punching the dog. A woman who had been caring for the stray dog found the dog near death and was taking it to get medical attention when the dog passed away. Meanwhile, former South Laurel Choral Director Mark Felts was indicted for third-degree sodomy in August. The indictment charges he had sexual intercourse with a minor in 2017. In October, another indictment charged Felts with six counts of first-degree sexual abuse with a 15-year-old that occurred between March 2015 into the spring of 2017. In that indictment, Felts was also termed as ""a person in a position of authority or position of special trust."" April saw the arrest of Vaughn Ashley Brock II, who was charged with murder and first-degree arson in an incident that took place on March 30 in which he fled the scene after his residence caught fire and his son was found dead inside a washing machine in the torched residence. Brock reportedly told police the child was playing with a lighter and started the fire. The initial investigation, however, showed that the fire started in a different section of the mobile home than Brock initially described to the police. GROWTH FOR LONDON - LAUREL COUNTY 2019 had its fair share of bad news, but there were numerous positives Laurel saw. London acquired ownership on the Levi Jackson Wilderness Road Park. With new management, the park is seeing an ongoing renovation, including the removal of dead trees and the installation of a new electric system. The former Kmart store on KY 192 saw its vacancies filled. Kohl\'s, Marshalls, Planet Fitness and Five Below were all welcomed as new businesses in London. Construction began on London Town Center next to London Elementary School. The center is shaping up to form a small park for residents and tourists to sit down and enjoy. There will also be a performance stage, in which the city hopes to bring national acts. More controversial was the acquisition of a 34-foot Christmas tree. The $85,000 investment bewildered some residents. The city hopes the tree can bring visitors over the years to come. EXTRACURRICULAR ACCOMPLISHMENTS The county also experienced numerous extracurricular achievements through its local students. The South Laurel Band won the Class 4-A State Marching competition for its second consecutive year. The North Laurel Lady Jags competed for the first time at the KHSAA Girls Sweet Sixteen Basketball quarterfinals. On the middle school level, the North Laurel seventh grade girls basketball team took home the KBC State Championships. Meanwhile, the North Laurel eighth grade football team saw victory during the KMSFA Eighth Grade Division 1 State Championship. Exciting audiences was also the first-ever official boxing tournament in Laurel County. Hosted by Loughran\'s Boxing and put together by USA Boxing was the 2019 Southeastern Kentucky Boxing Invitational in March. Amateur fighters of all ages performed in front of a larger-than-expected crowd. LOCALS GO NATIONAL Laurel County was thrilled again after seeing their neighbors on national television.

Coronavirus updates: Live updates from Tuesday\'s news How quickly life will get back to normal will depend on a number of factors, public health experts say, including the vaccine\'s effectiveness, how many people are willing to get it and how quickly, and how much the virus is still raging out of control. ""There is an end to this,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Even if a vaccine is approved this year, there won\'t be enough available to change the course of the pandemic for months, said Samuel Scarpino, an assistant professor at Northeastern University in Boston, who directs the school\'s Emergent Epidemics Lab. Companies already have begun making hundreds of millions of doses of their candidate vaccines, anticipating approval (and ready to throw out those same doses if their vaccine doesn\'t prove safe or effective enough). The government has promised a smooth rollout across the country, starting immediately after a thumbs-up from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Pfizer, which is producing the frontrunning vaccine candidate, has said it will ask later this month for FDA authorization. It\'s not clear how long the FDA will take to comb through the mountains of required paperwork, but many expect approval before the end of the year. Still, it will take a while before enough doses are delivered to a drug store or clinic convenient for the vast majority of Americans. Health care workers fighting COVID-19 will get first dibs on a vaccine, followed by first responders and the frail elderly. ""We all want our lives back,"" said Dr. Mary Bassett, director of the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University and a former New York City Health Commissioner. ""The vaccine won\'t achieve that because it can\'t be distributed widely enough, fast enough."" Then there\'s the question of how many people will take a vaccine. There\'s a lot of hesitancy at the moment; the percentage of people saying they\'d take a vaccine fell substantially from May to September. Public health experts hope much of that hesitation will go away after a vaccine has been shown safe and effective and community leaders start baring their shoulders to get vaccinated themselves. ""There\'s a famous line in the vaccine world that says, \'Vaccines don\'t save people, but vaccinations do,\'"" said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, a professor at Harvard Medical School and an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, both in Boston. No vaccine works perfectly. The FDA has said COVID-19 vaccines must work at least half the time to win approval – though early signs are that they will be much more effective than that. In its first release of effectiveness data, the candidate vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech proved 90% effective against COVID-19. But even if everyone got a vaccine that effective, 1 out of 10 people wouldn\'t be protected against COVID-19. And it\'s impossible to know for certain who is protected until an infection proves they\'re not. That\'s why experts say that roughly 70% of the population will need to be vaccinated to provide so-called herd immunity – enough protection to interrupt the chain of transmission and protect the vast majority of people. With measles, which is more contagious than COVID-19, that figure is about 90%, and there have been outbreaks in recent years in communities where the vaccination rate has fallen below that level. Plus, it\'s not clear how long vaccine protection lasts. Vaccine developers are hoping for at least one to two years. But a small number of people have already contracted COVID-19 a second time, and protection against the common cold, which often comes from a related coronavirus, lasts only about six months, studies have shown. Vaccine experts have said they expect vaccines to provide longer protection than a natural infection, but it\'s too soon to know. The possibility of a short period of protection from a natural infection also means the public is unlikely to achieve herd immunity from infections, experts said. Despite its rapid spread in the spring, only about 10% of Americans had been exposed to the coronavirus by late summer. And without long-term protection, those who were infected will remain vulnerable and will have to continue wearing masks and taking other health precautions. Herd immunity won\'t become a reality until vaccines can reach the majority of Americans who want them – which could take half a year or more. Dr. Peter Hotez, pediatrician and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said recently he\'d get a vaccine regardless of its effectiveness. Even if it isn\'t perfect, it could give him extra antibodies to fight off disease, said Hotez, noting that at age 62, he\'s in a higher-risk category. ""If it\'s not durable, at least I\'ve got some level of neutralizing antibody on board and then can get boosted later,"" he said in a recent webinar. ""To give yourself the best chance over the next year, you want some neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses in your body."" To really get out of this mess will require a combination of factors: vaccines, testing, behaviors – and patience. With the epidemic running out of control in most of the United States, now is not the time to be waiting passively for a vaccine, Fauci and others have said. The best weapons against COVID-19 remain mask wearing, social distancing, hand washing and avoiding crowds, such as at football games, weddings, graduations and even family gatherings. ""Those are the tools that we\'re going to use as a whole to get this pandemic under control,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a call with state officials Monday. ""We\'ll certainly look forward to a time when we\'re not required to keep up those precautions. But that day is certainly not now.""

Updated: June 16, 2024 @ 5:55 pm Emily Patrick epatrick@richmondregister.com While the Fourth of July holiday promises cookouts and fireworks, Kentuckians should be on the lookout for food borne illnesses, according to a press release from the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. “As food heats up in the summer temperatures, bacteria multiply rapidly. To protect yourself, your family and friends from foodborne illnesses during warm-weather months, safe food handling when outdoors is critical,” the release states. “Health officials with the Kentucky Department for Public Health … urge the public to take steps to avoid illness.” The DPH recommends the following: Remember to pack and transport food safely. Keep cold food cold. Place cold food in a cooler with ice or frozen gel packs. Cold food should be stored at 40 degrees or cooler to prevent bacterial growth. Meat, poultry and seafood may be packed while still frozen to stay colder longer. Organize cooler contents, and consider packing beverages in one cooler and perishable foods in another. That way, as picnickers open and re-open the beverage cooler to replenish their drinks, the perishable foods won’t be exposed to warm outdoor air temperatures. Keep coolers closed. Once at the picnic site, limit the number of times the cooler is opened as much as possible. This helps to keep the contents cold longer. Don’t cross contaminate. Be sure to keep raw meat, poultry and seafood securely wrapped. This keeps their juices from contaminating prepared/cooked foods or foods that will be eaten raw, such as fruits and vegetables. Remember, food safety begins with proper hand cleaning including in outdoor settings. Before setting out your picnic feast, make sure hands and surfaces are clean. If you don’t have access to running water, use a water jug, some soap and paper towels. Also consider moist disposable towelettes for cleaning hands. Take care to keep all utensils and platters clean when preparing food. Cook food thoroughly. When it’s time to cook food, have a food thermometer ready. Use a meat thermometer to make sure you reach safe internal cooking temperatures: 145 degrees for fresh beef, pork, veal and lamb, with a three minute rest time; 160 degrees for hamburgers and ground pork, veal or lamb; 165 degrees for poultry; 145 degrees for fish. Always be sure food is cooked thoroughly. Keep “ready” food hot. Grilled food can be kept hot until served by moving it to the side of the grill rack, just away from the coals. This keeps it hot but prevents overcooking. Don’t re-use platters or utensils. Using the same platter or utensils that previously held raw meat, poultry or seafood allows bacteria from the raw food’s juices to spread to the cooked food. Instead, have a clean platter and utensils ready at grill-side to serve your food. Check for foreign objects in food. If you clean your grill using a bristle brush, check to make sure that no detached bristles have made their way into grilled food. Avoid sharing utensils and serving foods buffet style. It may help limit the spread of the novel coronavirus and limit the amount of food that is shared outside the immediate family. Finally, remember to keep food at proper temperatures. The key is to never let your picnic food remain in the “danger zone” — between 40 degrees and 140 degrees — for more than two hours, or one hour if outdoor temperatures are above 90 degrees. This is when bacteria in food can multiply rapidly, leading to foodborne illness. For more information on food safety, visit cdc.gov/foodsafety/index.html.
