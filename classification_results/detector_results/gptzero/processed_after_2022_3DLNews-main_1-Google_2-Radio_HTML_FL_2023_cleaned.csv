The White House says there should be no conditions on raising the debt ceiling in order for the country to maintain its full faith and credit. House Republicans say spending cuts need to be part of the discussion if the debt ceiling is to be raised. Biden announced a meeting with congressional leaders following the House passage of a bill that paired a debt-ceiling hike with sweeping spending cuts. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said he would not schedule that bill for a vote on the floor of the Senate. Biden has said he will not negotiate with McCarthy on any spending cuts as long as they are linked to increasing the debt ceiling. “President Biden will never force middle class and working families to bear the burden of tax cuts for the wealthiest, as this bill does,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement, slamming House Republicans for voting to enact cuts to government programs. As negotiations appear to be starting, here’s a look at what they will be talking about. What is a debt ceiling, why does the federal government have debt, and what happens if we default? Here’s what we know now: The debt limit, sometimes called the debt ceiling, is the maximum amount the United States can borrow to pay the government’s debts. The amount must be approved by Congress. Congress has raised that debt limit some 100 times since the limit was enacted in 1917. The debt limit covers more than 99% of all federal debt. The government spends vast amounts of money each day. As of Tuesday morning, the federal government has spent $3,148,899,565,520 — that is a little over $3 trillion — in fiscal year 2023, which started in October 2022. Federal programs, including Social Security, Medicare and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) are funded with money collected from taxes. When the government spends more on programs than it brings in through taxes and other revenue, it must borrow money to pay for those programs. Raising the debt limit means allowing the government to borrow more money to fund the programs currently in place. Congress must approve any increase in the limit. “Every item of federal spending is going to be affected — whether you’re talking about payments that individuals receive, federal benefits, paychecks to civilian and military employees, grants to state and local governments — all of these are going to be touched,” Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told Fortune the last time there was a debate on raising the debt ceiling. In addition to such programs as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the paychecks of 1.4 million members of the U.S. military and nearly 3 million government employees would be at stake. Grants that states receive that cover things like school programs, Medicaid and public transit would dry up. Nearly a third of the money states spend comes from the federal government. Approval of a debt limit increase allows the federal government to pay the nation’s bills and maintain the full faith and credit of the U.S. government — or the reputation of the country to pay its bills. If an individual fails to pay his or her bills, they become a credit risk, meaning it is more difficult to borrow money because creditors are not sure they will be paid back. The same things happen when a country cannot pay its bills. If the country’s credit rating falls then borrowing money becomes more expensive because the government will be charged a higher rate of interest on loans. Some House Republicans want to tie legislation to raise the debt limit to federal spending cuts. “Look, you only have so many leverage and negotiating points. The debt ceiling is one of those. Nobody in America wants us to blindly just raise the debt ceiling again if we don’t get structural reforms around here. Nobody wants that,” Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, told reporters earlier this year. On the other side, Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said Democrats were not interested in negotiating over what should happen to pay the bills the government already owes. “In exchange for not crashing the United States economy, you get nothing,” Schatz said in January about Republicans’ request for Democrats to join them at the negotiating table. “We have to tell them there is no table,” Schatz said. Republicans have suggested that if the debt ceiling is not raised, legislation should be passed that would direct the Treasury to give priority to certain bills, such as payments to bondholders and benefits to Social Security recipients, over other government obligations. Democrats are against it and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says there is no mechanism in place to make such decisions. The debt limit today stands at $31.4 trillion. The last time the debt ceiling was lifted (increased) was in December 2021. A shutdown of the government happens when annual funding for ongoing federal government operations expires and Congress does not renew it by Oct. 1, the first day of the fiscal year. Failure to raise the debt ceiling means the government cannot borrow money to pay for government programs.

We know that just one descriptor can hardly capture the spirit and cultures of so many people who descend from a vast geography that includes present-day Southwestern U.S. states to the southern most tip of South America, and nearly every present-day country and island in between. This is why you\'ll see many different ways in which people describe themselves and their heritage. You\'ll see the terms Latina, Latino, and their non-gendered versions Latine and Latinx. You might also see people identify as Hispanic, Chicano, Tejano, Taino, Isleños, Boricua, Afro-Latino, in addition to the many more terms used for people who have families and ancestors in the 22 nations and territories that comprise Latin America.

This film was just awarded a 2022 Imagen Award for Best Short Film! Let’s talk about Hispanic and Latino Heritage Month! Yes, we’ve been celebrating since 1988 when President Ronald Regan expanded President Lyndon Johnson’s Hispanic Heritage Week. But what does Hispanic even mean? What about Latino? Glad you asked. When we say “Hispanic” we refer to people whose families come from Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America. Latin America is what we understand to be South America, Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands where Romance languages (like Spanish, Portuguese, and French) are spoken. Your linguist and polyglot friends will explain to you that Romance languages are Latin-based, that they are evolutions of Latin, hence Latin America When we say “Latino” we refer to people whose ancestors are from one or more of the 22 countries and territories in Latin America. We use both Hispanic and Latino to be inclusive, because people from French and Portuguese-speaking countries like Brazil and Haiti are not Hispanic but share many cultural traditions and commonalities with Spanish-speaking Latin Americans. This is how we understand these identifying words today. But language is a living and ever-changing concept. And we create new words and definitions to match how we choose to describe ourselves and find solidarity with one other. For example, we hear more and more people use the word ""Latine"" as a way to describe people of Latin American descent without designating any one gender to a group of people. It is another way to be more inclusive with our language. We also know that all of this is complicated and that some people interpret these broad terms negatively and exclusionary because they leave out the many Indigenous communities throughout Latin America who have sustained their languages, cultures, and traditions despite colonization’s efforts to eliminate them. We understand that no one term could ever accurately capture the diversity within all of Latin America and the many traditions each community has carried with them throughout the diaspora. It\'s not perfect, but we do hope to find the words that celebrate and uplift the incredible history and bright future of the Latin American diaspora in the United States. When you hear ""Latino"" you probably think of people from Latin America - places like Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, etc. But where exactly did the history of that word come from, and has it always meant Central America and South America as well as the Caribbean? Trace the origin of the term ""Latino"" and the debates that still surround it as well as the term ""Hispanic"" and ""Latinx."" From the 2023 PBS Short Film Festival: A young boy takes on more chores and odd jobs around his neighborhood to raise money for a ticket to a magic show, but when his grandma loses her job, he is faced with a difficult decision. From America ReFramed: On May 5th, 1991, people took to the streets of Washington D.C.’s Mount Pleasant neighborhood to protest the police shooting of a young Salvadoran man, Daniel Gomez. Through testimony, song, poetry, and street theater, LA MANPLESA: An Uprising Remembered weaves together the collective memory of one of D.C.’s first barrios and dives into the roots of the \'91 rebellion. From American Masters: Jovita Idar (1885-1946) helped organize the first Mexican American civil rights conference in 1911 to address racism, lynching, and dismal educational opportunities for Mexican American children. Support your local PBS station in our mission to inspire, enrich, and educate. Let\'s be honest, food is one of the most delightful ways to learn about one\'s culture. Food is love! Each ingredient is a note in the song that tells the history and movement of a people. The different flavors of the many Hispanic and Latino communities tell us about the environment, the pace of life, and the celebrations. And of course, there are dishes that will transport us home with just one bite. We could talk about food and how meaningful it is all day long so let us stop here and serve up some programs and documentaries that highlight the food and recipes of Hispanic and Latino cultures.

— Black Friday sales did gangbusters as the nation enters a holiday shopping season expected to test shoppers, who account for nearly three-quarters of U.S. economic activity. Consumers spent a record $9.8 billion online on Black Friday, which marks a 7.5% increase over the year prior, according to Adobe Analytics. Shopper visits, a metric used to assess in-person sales, rose 4.6% compared to a year ago — a rate nearly double the average overall increase in foot traffic so far this year, retail data firm Sensormatic Solutions said. Even more, consumers are expected to spend between $12 billion and $12.4 billion on Cyber Monday, which would make it the biggest online shopping day ever recorded, Adobe Analytics said. A significant reduction of inflation over the past year has delivered some relief for consumers. At the same time, they’ve been squeezed by a decline in savings built up during the pandemic and a spike in borrowing costs for loans like credit cards and mortgages. “The Christmas buying season got off to a good start, as Black Friday sales appear to be strong,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told ABC News. “Consumers are hanging tough.” A host of key indicators bode well for consumers as the holiday season takes hold. The unemployment rate stands near a 50-year low, wage growth outpaces inflation and savings have been resilient for upper- and middle-income households, Zandi said. The U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 4.9% over three months ending in September, more than doubling growth in the previous quarter and rebuking worries about a possible recession, a government report last month showed. Black Friday sales data suggests that the good times for consumers may continue for the remainder of the year, Zandi said. “While Black Friday isn’t always a good guide to overall Christmas sales, this is a good sign,” he noted. Still, potential pitfalls remain for consumers and, by extension, the U.S. economy, Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst at BMO Financial Group, told ABC News. Credit card debt climbed to a record high in the third quarter of 2023, surging nearly 5% from the previous quarter and leaving a growing share of borrowers late on payments, a Federal Reserve report earlier this month showed. The growing debt has emerged alongside a spike in borrowing costs for loans from credit cards to mortgages that stems from interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Since last year, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate at the fastest pace in more than two decades, seeking to slash price hikes by slowing the economy and reducing consumer demand. In theory, the economy should eventually falter as it becomes more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow. The job market, for instance, remains robust but has slowed in recent months. Broad economic trends offer ample “reason to be concerned,” Siegel said. He noted, however, that Black Friday sales appeared to dispel fears of a worst-case scenario for consumers. “The question was, ‘Is it going to be such an overhang that it closes the cash registers and keeps people from going online and in stores?'” Siegel said. “The retailers’ response would suggest that it was not.” Rosy inferences from the data deserve a note of caution, Siegel said. Consumers often spend during the holidays, even if it means shopping beyond their means, Siegel added, making Black Friday sales an imperfect shorthand for consumer health. “The holidays have gotten off to a good start,” Siegel said. “What you and I can see from revenues is what people spent.

FILE PHOTO FREMONT, CA - JULY 26: Kuka robots work on Tesla Model X in the Tesla factory in Fremont, California, on Thursday, July 26, 2018. (Photo by Mason Trinca for The Washington Post via Getty Images/The Washington Post via Getty Im) A Tesla manufacturing robot “attacked” an engineer at a Texas factory in 2021, leaving the man bloodied and witnesses to the event in shock, according to a report. >> Read more trending news The incident took place at the Tesla Gigafactory based in Austin, according to a report filed with regulators. The story came to light last week when the website The Information published a report about it. The incident happened when an engineer started to work on three robot arms but didn’t realize that only two had been shut off, The Information reported. As he was working on a software update, the third robotic arm kept moving and “pinned the engineer against a surface.” The robot’s claw dug into the worker’s back and arm, leaving him with an open wound on his left hand, The Information reported, citing two unnamed witnesses. One of the other workers in the area pushed an emergency stop button and the engineer was able to get out of the grasp of the robot’s arm. He fell into a scrap metal chute, trailing blood behind him, according to the story. Tesla has not yet responded to a request for comment from The Information, Fortune and other media outlets, but the company’s owner, Elon Musk, commented on the story via X, formerly known as Twitter. “Truly shameful of the media to dredge up an injury from two years ago due to a simple industrial Kuka robot arm (found in all factories) and imply that it is due to Optimus now,” Musk wrote in the X post on Wednesday. The Optimus is Tesla’s humanoid robot. The accident in Texas involved a Kuka robot arm that is used in manufacturing automobiles there. The incident happened on Nov. 10, 2021, according to Tesla’s Form 300 report to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The company is legally required to report any on-the-floor injuries at its manufacturing plants. According to Fortune, OSHA inspected Tesla’s Austin factory once a year in 2021 and 2022. Tesla’s Fremont, California, factory was inspected nine times each year in 2021 and 2022, and four so far in 2023, the outlet reported. Tesla has seen other workplace incidents over the past few years, and in 2020, California regulators said Tesla had sent them incomplete factory injury reports. In a memo sent to Tesla at the time, Cal/OSHA warned the company that it found it had repeatedly failed to mention injuries at its main assembly plant in reports to the state. At least 36 injuries were left out of Tesla’s records in 2018 alone, the memo, reviewed by Business Insider, showed. The Workers Defense Project, a non-profit labor organization, filed a suit against Tesla in 2022 alleging that the company was not doing enough to provide sufficient safety training to employees.

Depot stores. Two cases were reported at the Okeechobee store. Okeechobee County Sheriff Deputies and Home Depot Criminal Investigations worked on six theft cases in June and July. Over $4,100 in tools were stolen like sanders, circular saws, and rotary hammers. Detectives said the pair would remove bar codes from more expensive items and replace them with barcodes from less expensive items. They would then take the item to a self checkout and pay less than the item sold for. Facing grand theft charges in Okeechobee are Robert Williams of Deerfield Beach and Nicholas Poltronieri of Port St. Lucie. Okeechobee will highlight the contributions of youth to agriculture during the 29th annual Farm City week luncheon today at the Ag Civic Center. County commissioner Brad Goodbread read a proclamation to honor farmers and ranchers. He said unfortunately it’s getting tougher and tougher and more expensive to farm in Okeechobee. “Be proud that we are still a thriving industry in Florida. With over 1,000 people moving here each day and all the changes in water policy with the federal and state government it won’t be long before its too expensive to farm and ranch in Florida.” The city council also passed a proclamation last week. The village of Indiantown honored a local producer Diana Cordeau who has a farm to table produce business. She noted many have to diversify operations now in agriculture. She appreciated the recognition from the village. “We are a farm to table venue, we do weddings, demonstration dinners and we are very grateful that the village could recognize us for this award. There are so many farms and ranches in Indiantown.” The US House approved a continuing resolution to keep the federal government going until January 19th.

Man faces prison for fatal wreck An Okeechobee man admitted to drinking alcohol, using cocaine and smoking marijuana before a single vehicle crash that claimed a life, court records show. Adrian Estrada Hernandez pled no contest to DUI manslaughter, driving with a suspended license in a crash involving death and other charges at a recent court appearance. He faces a term in prison of between four and 15 years when he is sentenced on November 13th. The single vehicle crash on September 11, 2021 took the life of 55 year old Catherine Recio on South West 67th Drive. Troopers said a 1997 Mercedes sedan failed to negotiate a curve and struck a culvert before overturning. Okeechobee High School students excelled at the Southeast Builders Conference in Orlando this summer. The group took second place in the state. Instructor Stephen Szentmartoni said the work gives his students confidence. He noted the program prepares the students in a number of fields, not just carpentry. “We do the full gamut. Carpentry, welding, HVAC, septic, we do it all. The new CTE building will be a great addition.” The group took home a $1,000 cash prize for the program. Many of the students were offered jobs after graduation by certified builders. The group built a playhouse that included a trim and baseboard, an entrance door, flower pots, solar powered fans and LED lights. House Bill 1 approved by the legislature is considered the largest expansion of school choice ever in the US. It provides $8,500 for each student to attend a private school or to even be home schooled. Rep Tuck said private schools will face penalties if they don’t return funding they don’t earn, and can be taken off the list of approved facilities, until the money is paid. The bill eliminated all financial eligibility restrictions and the current cap on enrollment. The program will expand by 20,000 students this year and by 40,000 new scholarships next year around the state. The Pahokee City Commission gave city manager Rodney Lucas another four months to keep his job and improve his performance. Mayor Keith Babb said it’s a critical time as the city has to get work done at the marina to keep their state lease. “What we would do is put the campground and the marina at stake. If we don’t repair those docks by January the state will not renew our lease. Do you want to have that risk?” Commissioner Sarah Perez wanted Lucas gone. She claims he is incompetent. She added no work is getting done and the city looks foolish. “I’m not up here to get special treatment or special favors for me or for anyone else. If you are standing here advocating for the wrong thing, you are not for this city.” Resident Jason Crawford was also critical of how the city is run and what it is getting done. “We need to be realistic about things. If you keep switching people it is not going to change anything. We have to hold our commissioners accountable and they have to hold him (Mr. Lucas) accountable.” Lucas said the criticism against him is unfair as he has had less than 18 months on the job.

And it’s arguably here to stay. For the last two years, sales of vinyl records easily outpaced those of CDs. And purchases weren’t confined to ultra-hip indie music shops. Big-box retailers like Target and Walmart are now big-time players, selling re-pressings of classic albums, as well as new drops from some of the world’s most successful pop-stars. Meanwhile, Record Store Day, the traditionally once-a-year infusion of vinyl rarities and reissues into independently owned record stores across the country, has been to independently owned vinyl music stores what Black Friday is to big-box retailers. Record Store Day is held on Saturday, April 22 at music retailers across Northeast Florida. The announcement of this year’s RSD carried news of exclusive vinyl from a diverse range of artists, from Taylor Swift to Beach House, Jason Isbell & the 400 Unit, T Rex, the Magnetic Fields and many, many more. This year’s RSD also coincides with the much-celebrated 50th anniversary of hip hop. As such, there’ll be a range of exclusive releases from hip-hop artists, including Ol’ Dirty Bastard and Rza, Nas, Slum Village, Prince Rakeem, Chief Keef and more. With hundreds of reissues, previously unreleased live recordings, unique box sets and eclectic compilations on offer for each RSD drop, even the most fervent vinyl fiends are likely to be overwhelmed. So we reached out to a handful of local record store owners to find out what they’re rolling out and what they’re excited about. 875 Stockton St | Riverside | MAP Specialty: Punk, metal, new and used rarities, pop, indie Instagram: Tigerrecs Picks by James Siboni, owner/operator Agnostic Front – Victim In Pain AF was one of the first punk bands I ever heard. These guys started my a 20-plus-year obsession with the genre. This is a reissue of their classic, debut LP. Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers – At The Jazz Workshop 1970 Art is one of the greatest jazz drummers to ever live and his records are some of my favorites. This is a live session that is previously unreleased, made during a great time in his career. Death – Fate: The Best Of Death Death were the greatest death-metal band (so much so, the entire genre is named after them). Their first four LPs were their best work. This record is a greatest hits from those first four. So, it’s literally the best or the best in my opinion. It’s also worth mentioning that Death was from Florida, which makes them even cooler. (London) Suede – Suede Demos Of all the great British rock bands in history, Suede is pretty close to the top of my list of favorites. This release is demo versions of their first record. I’ve never heard it before and I can’t wait to put this record on and catch of glimpse of what these songs sounded like before they reached their final form. 1026 Edgewood Ave | Murray Hill | MAP Specialty: Eclectic, indie, rarities, books Instagram: Eraserrecordsjax Unfortunately, this will be Eraser Records last ever RSD. Multi-talented owners Matthew Anderson and Lauren Hamilton will not be renewing their lease when it expires later this year. Fortunately, the duo is throwing down big for their final Record Store Day, with a vendor market, live music and, of course, tons of cool records. Picks by Matt Anderson, owner/operator The Mars Volta – Frances the Mute T. Rex – Rockin and Rollin Sparks – A Woofer In a Tweeters Clothing The Orb feat. Lee Scratch Perry – The Upsetter at the Starhouse Session 81d King Street | St. Augustine | MAP Specialty: Indie, re-pressings, used essentials Instagram: tonevendor Picks by Tonevendor staff David’s Pick: Sir Douglas Quintet – Texas Tornado Hannah’s Pick: Beach House – Become Dan’s Pick: Albert Ayler – Europe 1966 Check out these other great independent record stores in our region: 3801 University Blvd W #4 | San Jose | MAP Located in a nondescript industrial park near the intersection of Powers Avenue and University Boulevard, Wolfson Equipment and Records is a crate digger’s dream. Though the store boasts 5,000 sq. ft. of records, CDs, cassettes, books and miscellaneous music ephemera (posters, flyers, tees, buttons, etc.), a few seemingly arbitrary RSD rules have kept Wolfson from (officially) participating in the event (something about not having windows). No bother, owner Ron Johnston says his store still draws an RSD crowd, simply by sticking to the store’s modus operandi; putting out hundreds, if not thousands of new arrivals each week. Of particular note, Johnston says his recent acquisitions include some eclectic collections––‘80s mopecore like the Smiths and The Cult on vinyl, a vast assortment of classic and rare soul albums on CD. A good bet on any given day, Wolfson is a must-see on RSD. 1522 Hendricks Ave | San Marco | Map Formerly a weekend pop-up at the Beach Blvd. Flea Market, Yesterday and Today has a good selection of used rock, pop, soul and jazz records. They get new inventory pretty consistently and they have been the region’s longest-running participant of Record Store Day. 2999 Edison Ave | Westside | Map Operating out of the same space, at the corner of Edison and McDuff, since the late 1960s, DJ’s is easily the oldest active record shop in Northeast Florida, if not the whole state. Most of their stock is older than most of our readers, and some of it could be considered downright obsolete. CDs, LPs, 45s, 78s, cassettes, 8-tracks, VHS tapes, laser discs and even the occasional book, as well as vintage stereo components and random collectibles whose target market may or may not actually exist. They specialize in golden era rap, classic jazz and old-school R&B, but you can still find the occasional cut from the 21st Century, if you look hard enough. If you have OCD, or you’re claustrophobic, or allergic to dust, mind the exits; you will lose your mind, quickly.'}]"
