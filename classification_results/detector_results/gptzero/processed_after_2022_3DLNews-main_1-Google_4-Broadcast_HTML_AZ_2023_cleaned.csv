""A couple months ago someone had left five gallons of used motor oil in front of my alley way property,"" she said. She was told by code enforcement that she had 24 hours to clear out the motor oil or pay a fine of $5,000. So she spent over $100 to get it cleared out. On Christmas Day, she found something similar — a pile of trash dumped directly behind her house. Weeks saw on her security camera that is placed on her back fence that two men dropped the trash off. ""There were two guys that were carrying furniture, a mattress and stuff over near the trash can,"" she said. According to the City of Tucson, from the middle of the alley to the home owner\'s back fence is that home owner\'s responsibility. Even if the city trash can is placed in that area. But on the city\'s website, it states that it\'s illegal to dump trash on private and public property. ""Waste management said they would get someone out here to clear it out but in the meantime if code enforcement comes out, they\'ll only give me 24 hours to clean it up,"" she said. ——-Tina Giuliano is a reporter for KGUN 9.

when she began to notice something in her tattoo studio that made her uneasy. “I started having strange tattoos and strange men in my studio,” she said. “I mean, I was taken aback. They were rude. They were mean. The girl didn’t speak at all – only the guy did, and he would yell at me.” “So I finally asked someone, ‘What is this?’ And a friend of mine said, ‘It’s probably a branding.’ I said, ‘What?’ I had no idea. I had no idea. I didn’t know.” Jernukian, a permanent makeup artist who lives in Phoenix, decided to find out more. She did some online research and attended meetings of groups that were all too familiar with branding – the practice of tattooing or marking sex trafficking victims, mostly women, with the names or symbols of those who victimize them. Over half of sex trafficking survivors have a branding mark that affects their mental health and impedes their healing and reintegration into society. A 2022 study that surveyed over 80 survivors in the U.S. showed they rated the need and impact of free laser-removal services at a high level for recovery. “Many victims are branded by their traffickers with tattoos conveying ownership, including names, symbols, and barcodes,” researchers wrote. “ We believe there is a greater need at a national level to support these survivors, allowing them to reclaim their bodies. Jernukian refused to continue being inadvertently complicit. She founded Soul Survivor Ink, a national nonprofit organization that helps survivors of human trafficking find providers near them who can cover, remove, and lighten branding tattoos. The service has expanded to 39 locations in the U.S., with several locations in Arizona and Texas. Removing the evidence of trauma is a complex and usually costly process. Jernukian and her partner artists do so for free. Although there are organizations that help survivors, Jernukian said that branding removal is an area that is neglected. “Some of the first things that programs will do is get them medical treatment, dental, housing, food, clothing,” Jernukian said. “They’ll sign them up for school, some counseling, meditation, but one thing they don’t offer is branding removal or cover-ups. So even though they’re starting to heal on the inside, they’re still not healed on the outside. They have to look at this every single day, and it brings them right back to where they were.” Traffickers mark skin as a message There were more than 10,360 cases of human trafficking, involving 16,710 individuals in 2021 alone, according to the most extensive sex trafficking data sets in the U.S., the National Human Trafficking Hotline. Experts say that is likely only a fraction of the true number. According to the Polaris Project, a nationwide organization that combats sex trafficking, nearly 75% of sex trafficking victims are women. Although data is difficult to come by, various sources estimate that up to half of victims have been branded by their traffickers. Sometimes the women are branded with a tattoo, and sometimes, Jernukian said, “the trafficker can take a knife and carve a symbol on their head or on their body. And then, even going further than branding, sometimes they’re burned.” Tattoos are usually black and white and common themes are money and loyalty, according to Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, director of the Sex Trafficking Intervention Research office at Arizona State University. The markings can be prominent on the victim’s face or neck to send a message to the victim and the world. “But sometimes it’s hidden; it’s near their body, their private parts – that is really a message to buyers or other traffickers,” she said. Not only do traffickers use branding as a way to show ownership, said Roe-Sepowitz, but “for the victim, there’s also the psychology of ‘I belong to him.’ This is a connection that feels very real. And her trauma bond with him is deepened by the tattoo or the brand or the scarring.” As a permanent makeup artist, Jernukian had the skills to help, so she reached out to local organizations in 2014 and said, “Hey, this is what I do. Send me anyone for free. Just send them.’” At first, only a couple of women came to her for help. Then, she began getting calls from trafficking shelters twice a month. “And it grew and grew,” Jernukian said. “People were driving three, four hours to come see me … It started blowing up. I thought, ‘I don’t know how to do this. I don’t know how to help so many people.” “Then I was reminded that the Lord does not call the equipped. He equips the called. And so that was it. It took off and… we founded Soul Survivor Ink.” Healing by erasing the markers of trauma Every time a sex trafficking survivor looks at a forced branding, it can feel as if they are still in bondage, Jernukian said. Some survivors say that “it physically hurts, like they can feel it, and some even try to scrape it off themselves.” But many organizations that help survivors aren’t aware of the significance of this kind of trauma, and how it impacts a survivor’s mental and emotional health, making it harder to heal. When working with survivors, tattoo removal often feels like a bonus compared to health care, housing, and safety, Roe-Sepowitz said. But once she and others started working with survivors over time, the impact these brandings have on survivors’ healing became apparent. “I had a client who had a very significant, very dramatic white supremacy symbol on the back of her neck and it was impeding her life,” Roe-Sepowitz said. Still, deciding to remove the branding isn’t always a simple one, especially because so many victims are emotionally connected to their traffickers. The Polaris Project estimates that 4 out of 10 victims were trafficked by a member of their own families or were recruited by an intimate partner or a marriage proposal. “It can be years later and still a lot of them struggle with that mental abuse,” Jernukian said. “They still feel like they’re betraying this trafficker or this pimp, even though it’s been a couple of years or however long.They still feel the betrayal. And sometimes it’s extremely emotional when we’re either covering or removing it.” “It’s not like, ‘Get this off me,’ ” Jernukian said. “It takes a lot for them to make that decision. Because they’re still under control of this pimp. They feel like they’re betraying him. For us, it’s like, ‘Girl, go get that done.’ And they’re like, ‘Not yet’.” “Oftentimes our clients really didn’t have a huge support network and their traffickers became their families. They made them feel like they belong,” Roe-Sepowitz said. “That tattoo reminds them that they belong. And even in spite of the abuse and trauma they’re experiencing, it’s sort of better than the alternative being alone or homeless or hungry.” Many victims weren’t forced to get branded, Jernukian added. They were manipulated into it. “Some of the girls would say something like, ‘You have no idea what it took to earn this tattoo.’ They were proud to do it.” But once they’ve escaped their traffickers and have begun to heal, “they look back and wonder how did I get there? How did my mentality go that far?” Wiping away tears Natalie Grace, a 29-year-old Houston resident, connected with Soul Survivor Ink in 2022. She wants to remove two non-consensual tattoos that have marked her face since she was 24. Grace had been seeing a charismatic tattoo artist while dealing with a drinking problem. One day, after heavily drinking, she passed out next to him. “I woke up with these teardrops … tattoos on my face,” Grace said, pointing at black teardrops located at the outer corner of her eyes. ”He just did that while I was passed out as a joke because he had them too in the exact same place. It was kind of like saying ‘You’re mine now’.” She couldn’t get a job, or pay for food or housing. “And that’s what led me to being homeless and couch-hopping. That’s how I ended up in the human trafficking situation.” Her trafficker was later arrested and sentenced to prison. But the teardrops are a daily reminder of her past. “It’s like a SKU number for a shoe,” she said. “Wherever that shoe goes, it’s gonna lead back to the manufacturer.” “ Unless I’m actually wearing makeup and hiding the tattoos, it’s like, I can’t really be myself. I have to pretend to be someone else. And it’s horrible.” Grace was connected with Jernukian through other survivors who had been helped by Soul Survivors Ink. Together, they are working on finding a tattoo artist who will remove the tattoo from Grace’s face.

The chain was hit hard during the pandemic, when there wasn\'t as much of a demand for the business casual apparel they sold. Things haven\'t gotten better since then either, as consumers have been more interested in comfortable athleisure wear than the clothes that Express sells, causing the company\'s profits to drop. They closed 91 stores to offset the losses in 2020, but have not yet been able to turn things around, and it\'s not looking good for them. Retail industry consultant Shawn Grain Carter told Retail Dive, ""Express is truly on a respirator and teetering on possible bankruptcy."" To encourage customers to return, the store has been offering promotions like ""buy one, get one 50% off."" They also hired a new CEO and plan some layoffs to cut costs. However, Carter thinks it likely won\'t be enough, stating, ""I would not be surprised if they end up in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. I think it\'s sad because they were once a destination for young people to purchase goods at a decent price that were on trend."" The Container Store is another company Credit Risk Monitor scored with a 2, the second-worst rating possible, with a 4% to 10% chance of needing to declare bankruptcy in the next year. After some success during the pandemic, as more people stayed at home and needed goods from the retailer, lately, The Container Store has seen far fewer customers. The chain did try to woo some of Bed, Bath & Beyond\'s customers after their bankruptcy, accepting the defunct retailer\'s coupons for a time, but it hasn\'t seemed to help. CEO Satish Malhotra is aware of the issues and trying everything in his power to get back on track, including taking a 10% pay cut on his base salary so that the company\'s 5,000 employees could get their annual merit raises. No word yet on if any of The Container Store\'s 101 locations will be closing soon. Photo: Getty Images It\'s not all bad news for retailers in 2024. One brand that previously closed all their stores amid bankruptcy will be making a comeback next year. Toys R Us plans to open 24 stores nationwide in ""prime cities."" They\'ll also soon have locations in airports and on cruise ships. No word yet exactly where the new stores will be, but they\'ll be opening in the coming months.'}]"

The report Monday by the Arizona Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) Education Fund also said gas-powered lawnmowers, blowers, and trimmers contributed 985 tons of nitrogen oxides and 333 tons of fine particulate matter to the air that year, the most recent for which numbers are available. “Gasoline-powered lawn equipment produces really shocking amount of air pollution right in the neighborhoods where we live and breathe,” said Tony Dutzik, associate director and senior policy analyst at the Frontier Group, who co-authored the report. “These are pollutants like particulate matter and, you know, pollutants that lead to the formation of ozone smog that we know in some cases are linked to cancer, asthma attacks, other health problems,” Dutzik said. Replacing gas-powered lawn and garden equipment with electric versions is one possible solution, the report said, either by encouraging private individuals to make the switch or by having local governments lead the way. The first strategy is being pursued in Maricopa and Pima counties, where residents can receive cash vouchers for new electric equipment when they trade in their old gas-powered gear. Diane E. Brown, the executive director of the Arizona PIRG Education Fund, said the programs “help consumers switch to electric equipment that is better for their pocketbooks, air quality and public health.” “The largest barrier that consumers typically face in purchasing electric lawn equipment is the initial price tag. However, within one to three years that can be alleviated due to lower fuel and maintenance costs,” Brown said Monday. The programs offer a $150 voucher toward the purchase of a zero-emission mower for those who trade in their gas-powered models and a $50 voucher for electric equipment for those who turn in other items. Natalie Shepp, the environmental planning manager for the Pima County Department of Environmental Quality, said her county’s Cut Down Pollution program began in early 2020. Since it began, more than 1,130 pieces of gas-powered equipment have been exchanged for vouchers. “I do believe it has been successful,” Shepp said. “When we look at the air pollution contribution to those pieces of equipment now that they’re off the streets and recycled and being replaced with battery power, manual or plug-in electric (equipment). I do think it has had an impact and it is a beneficial program.” The report said Pima County lawn equipment was responsible for 115,724 tons of carbon dioxide in 2020, the 45th highest among counties, along with 271 tons of nitrogen oxide and 95 tons of fine particulate matter. Gas-powered equipment in Maricopa County added 233,413 tons of carbon dioxide, the 13th-highest county in the country. They also contributed 498 tons of nitrogen oxide and 167 tons of fine particulate matter to the air, the report said. Both the Maricopa County and Pima County programs are funded by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality. Dutzik said programs like those “help speed this transition toward cleaner equipment.” He said it’s important to provide financial incentives for communities, but that cities could lead by example when “making that change themselves.” “Ultimately, you know, the financial incentives are a really great way for people who are considering making the switch to get introduced to it and to make it more common in our communities,” Dutzik said. “There’s room here for … both incentives and for communities to really begin to explore transitioning away from this equipment.”'}]"
