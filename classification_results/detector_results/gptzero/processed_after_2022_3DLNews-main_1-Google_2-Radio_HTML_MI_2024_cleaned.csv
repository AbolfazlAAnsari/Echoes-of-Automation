hospital, which has been under attack from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops, amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. At least 14 patients have been moved from Nasser Hospital — located in the southern city of Khan Younis — with the help of the World Health Organization (WHO), the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said Monday. Nine patients are currently receiving care in European Gaza, International Medical Corps, UAE and Indonesia field hospitals, and five patients are in Al-Aqsa hospital in the south, the WHO said in a Monday release. Among the evacuated patients were two who needed continuous manual ventilation throughout their journey, according to the WHO. Prior to the evacuation, the WHO said it and its partners had been denied entry into Nasser Hospital for two days. “There are still more than 180 patients and 15 doctors and nurses inside Nasser,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. “The hospital is still experiencing an acute shortage of food, basic medical supplies, and oxygen. There is no tap water and no electricity, except a backup generator maintaining some lifesaving machines.” Additionally, the ministry claims at least five people have died since the hospital lost power and that Israeli forces have arrested medical staff, including the director of the hospital and the only doctor responsible for caring for patients in the ICU. Ghebreyesus previously stated in a post on the social platform X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday that the hospital was “not functioning anymore.” Israel has disputed the hospital is no longer functional. According to a post on Monday on X by Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which coordinates humanitarian aid for Gaza, supplies have been delivered to Nasser Hospital. Among the aid includes a tanker carrying diesel fuel, water bottles, bread loaves, a replacement generator and medicine donated by the WHO, COGAT said. “The Nasser hospital was operational during the entire IDF activity,” COGAT posted. “We facilitated humanitarian aid and supplies to the hospital and coordinated a UN team to evacuate the patients.” In addition, the IDF claimed it found medicine meant for the Israeli hostages as well as weapons and terrorists, some of whom were allegedly posing as medical staff. “Boxes of medicine were found with the names of Israeli hostages on them,” the IDF said in a statement on Sunday. “The packages of medicine that were found were sealed and had not been transferred to the hostages.” The IDF said Monday it has arrested 200 people at the Nasser Hospital complex suspected of being terrorists. Since Hamas’ surprise terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, nearly 29,000 people in Gaza have been killed and more than 68,800 have been injured, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. About 1,200 have been killed in Israel, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office. The IDF said 573 soldiers have been killed since the war began and 235 have been killed since the ground invasion began. Additionally, there are about 134 hostages still believed to be in captivity in Gaza, 130 of them related to the current war and four related to the 2014 conflict. Of the 134, at least 32 are believed to be dead, according to the IDF and the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office. ABC News’ Sami Zayara contributed to this report. Copyright © 2024, ABC Audio.

'Photo: Getty Images A man handcuffed in a viral photo taken during the aftermath of the shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs\' Super Bowl LVIII victory parade last Wednesday (February 14) attempted to clear his name after being falsely identified as one of the gunmen. Denton Loudermill, an Olathe, Kansas, native and father of three, was captured in a Getty Images photo that circulated online after the fatal shooting with many incorrectly assuming he was responsible, as well as several notable Republican politicians misidentifying him as an illegal alien. Loudermill was instead detained for being intoxicated and not moving away from the crime scene. “I just want to clear my name that I had nothing to do with anything,” Loudermill said at a press conference Saturday (February 17) via KMBC. “I was just enjoying myself like everybody else, but other than that, I was out there not to harm anybody. I was just enjoying the parade like everybody else,” he added. The shooting stemmed from a dispute between several people, Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves announced during an update last Thursday (February 15) via ESPN. Graves confirmed that the total number of victims injured, including Lisa Lopez-Galvan, identified as the lone person killed in the incident, had risen to 23. The other victims injured in the shooting ranged between the ages of eight and 47, with half reported to be under the age of 16. Fire Chief Ross Grundyson confirmed that eight victims were reported to have sustained critical injuries and seven were in serious condition. Three people -- including juveniles -- were detained and multiple firearms were recovered at the scene. Drone footage shows a massive crowd quickly parting after shots were fired near the corner of Pershing and Kessler in the Union Station area of downtown Kansas City. The Chiefs issued a statement in response to the incident on their official website and social media accounts last Wednesday. ""We are truly saddened by the senseless act of violence that occurred outside of Union Station at the conclusion of today\'s parade and rally,"" the Chiefs said. ""Our hearts go out to the victims, their families, and all of Kansas City. ""We are in close communication with the Mayor\'s office as well as the Kansas City Police Department. ""At this time, we have confirmed that all of our players, coaches, staff and their families are safe and accounted for. ""We thank the local law enforcement officers and first responders who were on-scene to assist."" Another video shared online showed police responding to an active shooter situation at Union Station, where the parade concluded. The Chiefs were celebrating their third Super Bowl victory in the past five years days after defeating the San Francisco 49ers, 25-22, in overtime during Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday (February 11), having previously defeated San Francisco, 31-20, in Super Bowl LIV. Kansas City is also the first team since the New England Patriots in 2005 to repeat as Super Bowl champions and the ninth in NFL history.'}]"

the age of 47 while incarcerated in a Kremlin prison last week, claims her husband was killed by President Vladimir Putin. Yulia Navalnaya shared a nine-minute video on Navalny\'s official YouTube account Monday in which she blamed Putin for the death of her ""children\'s father"" while he was serving at the notorious IK-3 penal colony in Kharp located north of the Arctic Circle. “We know exactly why Putin killed Alexei three days ago,” Navalnaya said. “We will tell you about it soon. We will definitely find out who exactly carried out this crime and how exactly. We will name the names and show the faces.” “Vladimir Putin killed my husband,” Navalnaya added. “By killing Alexei, Putin killed half of me — half of my heart and half of my soul. But I still have the other half, and it tells me that I have no right to give up. “I will continue Alexei Navalny’s work. I will continue to fight for our country. And I encourage you to stand by my side."" Officials said Navalny collapsed and lost consciousness at the IK-3 penal colony in Kharp located north of the Arctic Circle, after having previously ""felt unwell"" following a walk. “The medical staff of the institution arrived immediately, and an ambulance team was called,” the prison service said via the New York Post. “All necessary resuscitation measures were carried out, which did not yield positive results. Doctors of the ambulance stated the death of the convict.” “The causes of death are being established.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peslov said that Putin had been notified of Navalny\'s death. Navalny, a Russian native, gained admiration from the opposition after voluntarily returning to his home country from Germany, where he had undergone treatment for what was proven to be an attempt to poison him with a nerve agent, in 2021. Navalny said he was poisoned in Siberia in August 2020, however, the Kremlin denied having attempted to kill him, claiming there was no evidence that he was poisoned with a nerve agent.'}]"

When you let others go first, it establishes a higher value of love by adding the element of respect and showcases God’s way of doing life. Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor giving preference to one another. – Romans 12:10 NKJV It’s easy to get caught up in the pursuit of personal achievements and recognition. Yet, there’s an extraordinary beauty in stepping aside, placing others first and allowing someone else to shine. This isn’t about diminishing your light or pausing your ambitions but kindling the flame in others, helping them glow brighter. When you honor others above yourself, you reflect a heart shaped by grace, a heart that mirrors the selfless love of Jesus. Think about how Jesus walked this earth. He, the King of kings, demonstrated compassion to others, led His disciples, expressed a love that is still captivating today, knelt to wash His disciples’ feet, submitted to God and gave His life sacrificially for others. So, where to start? You can start small. It might be letting someone else take the credit for a shared success or stepping aside to make another voice heard. While countercultural, it may include being chivalrous in daily routines. You plant seeds of honor and respect in the quiet, often unseen moments by – holding a door open, offering a word of encouragement or simply listening with an open heart. By praying and trusting the Holy Spirit to lead you, He will guide you in honoring others by your actions. Christ gave His life so others would shine. Every person you encounter is a beloved creation of God, worthy of dignity and honor. When you see them through this lens, you’re choosing to walk in step with the Spirit, embodying the very essence of Jesus’ love.

That has led members of both groups to put sometimes conflicting pressure on elected leaders. Colin Jackson of the Michigan Public Radio Network reports. COLIN JACKSON, BYLINE: When driving north on the freeway coming from Detroit, you may notice Congregation Shaarey Zedek - a synagogue in the suburb of Southfield - out the window. It\'s where Rabbi Aaron Starr hosted several of Michigan\'s political leaders for a healing moment after the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Some 1,200 people were killed in that assault, and Hamas militants continue to hold hostages. AARON STARR: There was so much leadership that really was speaking out about Israel\'s right to defend itself and our need to protect Jews everywhere around the world, that Jews shouldn\'t have to live in fear. JACKSON: One leader who did not attend the gathering was Starr\'s own congresswoman, Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib. Starr says he reached out to her office following the October 7 attack. Several weeks later, he says they had a polite conversation. But he thinks Tlaib\'s remarks around Israel\'s response have been divisive. STARR: No one that I\'m aware of in the Jewish community, at least none of the Jewish leaders, claim that Israel is perfect. But we do think that Israel has a right to defend itself. And I would love to engage in conversation with the congresswoman on a deeper level. JACKSON: Tlaib\'s leaves office did not grant requests for an interview with NPR. Last November, the GOP-led House censured her for using rhetoric critics described as hateful. They pointed in part to a video Tlaib posted on social media that included protesters using a portion of the chant - from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. She later defended the phrase - from the river to the sea - as a, quote, ""aspirational call for freedom."" Others consider it an antisemitic call for the elimination of Israel and removal of Jews. Speaking on the House floor before that censure vote, Tlaib said critics were distorting her words. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RASHIDA TLAIB: No government is beyond criticism. The idea that criticizing the government of Israel is antisemitic sets a very dangerous precedent, and it\'s been used to silence diverse voices speaking up for human rights across our nation. JACKSON: Tlaib, the only Palestinian American serving in Congress, pointed to her own ties to the region. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TLAIB: We are human beings (crying) just like anyone else. My sity, my grandmother, like all Palestinians, just wants to live her life with freedom and human dignity we all deserve. JACKSON: Israel\'s counteroffensive into Palestinian territories has killed more than 28,000 people. That\'s according to Gaza health officials, who say most of the dead are women and children. Tlaib is calling for a cease-fire, but Starr argues that would allow Hamas to continue endangering Israelis. Drive about 30 minutes away from Starr\'s synagogue to a different part of the district, you\'ll find Dearborn, a largely Muslim Detroit suburb where many residents do want a cease-fire. SAMRAA LUQMAN: I mean, in order for us American Muslims to feel like we are being heard, we want to see elected officials respond in a way that\'s moral and just. JACKSON: Community organizer Samraa Luqman wants her elected leaders to show solidarity with the people of Gaza. Over 85% of its population has been displaced during Israel\'s retaliation - that\'s according to Human Rights Watch. President Biden\'s administration is trying to negotiate another pause in fighting. That pause would be tied to Hamas releasing hostages and humanitarian aid entering Gaza. In the U.S., all of this comes against the backdrop of an election year. LUQMAN: It\'s a lost opportunity for any candidate if you don\'t take the moral high ground and solicit us for votes. This is - we\'re going to vote in a bloc this time, and it\'s going to be with Palestine. JACKSON: Calls for political action are playing out in Michigan\'s presidential primary election. This weekend, Tlaib encouraged residents to vote uncommitted on their Democratic Party ballot, rather than for Biden. It\'s part of a statewide campaign called Listen to Michigan that\'s urging voters to use the primary to push for a change in Biden\'s policy toward Israel and Gaza. Early voting has already begun. The primary is next Tuesday. For NPR News, I\'m Colin Jackson in Detroit. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. NPR transcripts are created on a rush deadline by an NPR contractor.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': '(NEW YORK) -- Patients are being evacuated from Gaza\'s second-largest hospital, which has been under attack from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops, amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. At least 14 patients have been moved from Nasser Hospital -- located in the southern city of Khan Younis -- with the help of the World Health Organization (WHO), the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said Monday. Nine patients are currently receiving care in European Gaza, International Medical Corps, UAE and Indonesia field hospitals, and five patients are in Al-Aqsa hospital in the south, the WHO said in a Monday release. Among the evacuated patients were two who needed continuous manual ventilation throughout their journey, according to the WHO. Prior to the evacuation, the WHO said it and its partners had been denied entry into Nasser Hospital for two days. ""There are still more than 180 patients and 15 doctors and nurses inside Nasser,"" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. ""The hospital is still experiencing an acute shortage of food, basic medical supplies, and oxygen. There is no tap water and no electricity, except a backup generator maintaining some lifesaving machines."" Additionally, the ministry claims at least five people have died since the hospital lost power and that Israeli forces have arrested medical staff, including the director of the hospital and the only doctor responsible for caring for patients in the ICU. Ghebreyesus previously stated in a post on the social platform X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday that the hospital was ""not functioning anymore."" Israel has disputed the hospital is no longer functional. According to a post on Monday on X by Israel\'s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which coordinates humanitarian aid for Gaza, supplies have been delivered to Nasser Hospital. Among the aid includes a tanker carrying diesel fuel, water bottles, bread loaves, a replacement generator and medicine donated by the WHO, COGAT said. ""The Nasser hospital was operational during the entire IDF activity,"" COGAT posted. ""We facilitated humanitarian aid and supplies to the hospital and coordinated a UN team to evacuate the patients."" In addition, the IDF claimed it found medicine meant for the Israeli hostages as well as weapons and terrorists, some of whom were allegedly posing as medical staff. ""Boxes of medicine were found with the names of Israeli hostages on them,"" the IDF said in a statement on Sunday. ""The packages of medicine that were found were sealed and had not been transferred to the hostages."" The IDF said Monday it has arrested 200 people at the Nasser Hospital complex suspected of being terrorists. Since Hamas\' surprise terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, nearly 29,000 people in Gaza have been killed and more than 68,800 have been injured, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. About 1,200 have been killed in Israel, according to the Israeli Prime Minister\'s Office. The IDF said 573 soldiers have been killed since the war began and 235 have been killed since the ground invasion began. Additionally, there are about 134 hostages still believed to be in captivity in Gaza, 130 of them related to the current war and four related to the 2014 conflict. Of the 134, at least 32 are believed to be dead, according to the IDF and the Israeli Prime Minister\'s Office. ABC News\' Sami Zayara contributed to this report. Copyright © 2024, ABC Audio.

Dalenberg is investing $400,000 in the renovation of the former Ginopolis on W. Main Street into the Grand River Brewery. “We’re really looking forward to coming to Brighton,” Dalenberg said. He instantly took a liking to Brighton when he was looking for a new place to locate one of his brewpubs. “We really liked the Brighton area,” Dalenberg says. ""I liked the location (at the I-96 and US-23 interchange),” he says. ""Nobody had opened a brewpub (in Brighton) at the time. We’re good friends with Mike Corrigan and knew his tenant, Ginopolis, was struggling because of the pandemic and Main Street being closed off.” His first brewpub was in Jackson, then he added historic Marshall, and the Detroit suburb of Clawson venue was added last fall. He hopes to open the Brighton location n May or June. Dalenberg will be installing a 3-barrel brew house, which will allow them to produce three barrels, or 93 gallons per batch — the perfect size for small-scale beer recipes. His company also makes beer at Brew Detroit - it both brews and cans the beer. Grand River Brewery obtains all its meats, baked goods and specialty items from the Manchester Market, which he also owns. The store is a butcher shop, bakery and connoisseur kitchen all in one. The company makes its own breads at the Manchester location. “Sourdough, rye, you name it,” Dalenberg says. They get their beef from Noggle Farms - a family farm which has been in existence in the Manchester area since the 1860’s. The operation features pasture-raised beef with no growth hormones — beef which is dry-aged before sale. “My philosophy,” he says, ""is you great ingredients, and they are fresh, there isn’t much else you have to do.” In addition to a microbrewery, he also has a small distillery and winery. “We like to make things from scratch,” Dalenberg says. The company makes its own Cabernet sauvignon, merlot, pinot noir, an ice wine, and several other varieties of wine. “In fact, we started out as a winery 20 years ago called Veritas Vineyards LLC,” he says. He has a microbrewery license, tasting room license, distillery license and a small winemaker’s license. They also make agave spirits which come from the agave plant native to Mexico - the plant from which tequila is made. They make several kinds of whiskeys, including the popular Dead Man’s Bounty. They also make a bourbon barrel-aged stout, which is aged three months in bourbon barrels. Will Grand River Brewery in Brighton be more of a bar or a restaurant? Dalenberg says despite its name it will be more of restaurant than a pub. They will feature steaks, corned beef sandwiches (“We make our own corned beef,” he says), smoked whitefish chowder, a variety of salads, in-house sauerkraut, East North Carolina-style barbecue, Texas-style brisket, jambalaya, oysters Rockefeller, shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico and Thai coconut curry. Dalenberg assures that Grand River Brewery will also have vegan and gluten-free food. They will also have a large and varied seafood menu, featuring Lake Superior walleye, perch, lake trout, whitefish flown in from the Faroe Islands (located between Norway and Iceland in the Atlantic Ocean) and shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico. The business plans on having live music on Friday and Saturday nights. Dalenberg says they will also rent out the basement for weddings, anniversaries and other special occasions.

ANN ARBOR, Mich. – Michigan State rounded out a two-game road trip with a rematch against rival Michigan in Ann Arbor on Saturday night. In front a raucous crowd littered with fans from both schools at the Crisler Center, MSU defeated Michigan 73-63, giving the Spartans their first season sweep over their rival since 2019. “We’re not a perfect team. Although I haven’t seen many that are right now. We did what we had to do,” said MSU head coach Tom Izzo. Michigan State took command towards the latter stages of the second half, forcing the Wolverines into six turnovers and holding them scoreless for the game’s final seven minutes. Michigan committed a season-high 22 turnovers. Fifth-year Olivier Nkamhoua recorded eight, while Dug McDaniel had five. MSU capitalized, recording 19 points in transition and 27 points off turnovers. “I did think Michigan played well, ” Izzo said. “I thought in a lot of ways they played better than us. The turnovers really hurt them.” The Spartans went into halftime ahead by two after nearly squandering a nine-point lead within a few minutes. An unanswered, seven point solo run from sophomore Dug McDaniel re-ignited Michigan after a lackluster span. “It seems like when we get a lead, we just don’t have the maturity or the consistency to build on it,” said Izzo. MSU connected on only two of their 14 three-point attempts, but recorded 40 points in the paint. 17 first-half points from the bench also provided a boost. Freshman Coen Carr led the way with eight points, followed by Tre Holloman, who had six points, two assists and no turnovers in 22 minutes. “I think the real key for us today was I had made a concerted effort in our pregame talk about our bench has to bring more energy and be more valuable,” said Izzo. “Coen Carr brought a lot of value, Tre [Holloman] brought a lot of value. [Cooper] was pretty good.” Graduates Tyson Walker and Malik Hall were the only two players to score in double figures for MSU, recording 19 and 18 points, respectively. “Malik Hall has been not only as steady as you can be, but he had to do a hell of a job defensively,” said Izzo. With the win, MSU is now 17-9 on the season and 9-6 in conference play. The Spartans are tied for third in the Big Ten with Wisconsin. “We won a game in a tough environment,” said Izzo. “I wanna thank all of our fans that came down. It’s not easy to win on your rival’s court.” MSU returns to the Breslin Center on Tuesday night to take on Iowa at 7 p.m. Michigan State University Student Radio Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.'}]"
