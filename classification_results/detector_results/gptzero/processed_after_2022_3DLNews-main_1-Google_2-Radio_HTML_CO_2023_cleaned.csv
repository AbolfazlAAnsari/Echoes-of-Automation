A man in Denver paints a message on his car: “I’m going to kill them.” A veteran in El Paso County says inexplicable, emotional goodbyes to his children. An increasingly paranoid retiree stockpiles rifles and guns at his townhome in Denver. “I’m always homicidal,” a former Marine tells a cop. A woman reads a text message from her former spouse: “This is all because of you.” These details and allegations are drawn from just a few of the court cases filed under Colorado’s Extreme Risk Protection Order law, which is meant to take guns away from people who are a danger to themselves or others. From its implementation in 2020 through mid-November 2022, police officers and ordinary people used the law 359 times to ask courts to impose so-called “red flag” orders, which temporarily ban someone from buying and possessing guns. In all, 168 people were required to relinquish their firearms for a year or longer. In recent months, CPR News has reviewed records for each of those cases. Together, they show how the controversial new law is being used in Colorado. The analysis reveals cases where the law may have prevented murders and mass shootings. But it also shows striking differences in how different police agencies and courts are defining “extreme risk” — as well as frustrations and difficulties for people on both sides of the law. When they are taken together, Colorado’s “red flag” cases paint a disturbing picture of the countless moments that may precede acts of violence — from desperate people in the grips of suicidal ideations to would-be murderers with plans for revenge. In roughly half of the ERPO cases, about 180 in total, the respondent was accused of threatening others, either explicitly or indirectly. But at times, the people pursuing orders were more worried about someone’s irresponsible use of firearms, rather than any apparent intent to kill. Several people had fired guns into the walls of their homes while in the grip of paranoid delusions, court files stated. A smaller number of respondents — about a third of all cases — were reportedly considering death by suicide. The lower prevalence of suicidal people is “surprising,” said Chris Knoepke, assistant professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “We know risk of self-harm, risk of suicide, is more prevalent in general than very high-level threats to other people,” Knoepke said. The smaller number of suicide cases may show that people don’t know they can get help from the law when a loved one is struggling with suicidal ideations, he said. “Moving firearms out of the house, and making them inaccessible to the person at risk is one of the most effective ways of preventing suicide death and injuries from self-inflicted violence,” he said. There also were at least eleven people who reportedly discussed a “suicide by cop,” in which they intended to force a police officer to kill them. Often, people threatened to harm both themselves and others. In about 30 cases, the person allegedly talked about carrying out a mass shooting or other public attack, with various degrees of planning completed. At least half of those people were reported to have guns. In other cases, police simply wanted to stop the respondent from acquiring weapons. Among those cases where a judge agreed to issue an ERPO were: In about 100 of the roughly 360 cases filed, court records do not document an explicit threat of violence or misuse of a firearm. Many of these cases were filed by individual petitioners, rather than police, and they often were dismissed by judges. The typical subject of an ERPO petition was a 37-year-old man. In fact, nearly 90 percent of petitions were filed against men. Black people were somewhat disproportionately the subjects of petitions, making up about 9 percent of respondents whose race could be determined from court documents, compared to 6 percent of the state’s population. Those figures are influenced by heavier usage of ERPO in Denver, where Black people make up about 10 percent of the population and about 18 percent of ERPO cases. It was not possible to analyze the usage of ERPO against Latinos, because police are inconsistent in how they record data about Hispanic ethnicity. In all, 359 cases were initiated against about 335 different people. The respondents were suspected of possessing, in total, about 800 guns, according to court filings — but there was a wide range. One respondent had more than 60 firearms and had made alarming comments about hiding bodies, according to a family member’s testimony. In another case, detectives with Douglas County and Jefferson County sheriff’s offices seized 59 firearms and 50,000 rounds of ammunition from a man’s home and storage unit. The man had also been arrested for impersonating a sheriff’s deputy. “Red flag” petitions can be filed by two different groups of people. They can be initiated by someone with a close relationship to the subject, such as a family member, romantic partner or housemate. But they also can be filed by law enforcement officers. And the data shows that most Colorado law agencies are using the law rarely. In most counties, police have filed a handful of red flag petitions at most. In 40 of Colorado’s 64 counties, they had filed none at all, the analysis found. However, one agency stands out in the numbers: The Denver Police Department had filed about 90 red flag cases during the study period. That’s more than half of all the cases filed by law enforcement in the state. “It's our responsibility to protect our community. And this is part of protecting our community,” said Division Chief Joe Montoya, who oversees a team of investigators dedicated largely to ERPO. Shannon Frattaroli, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, said that red flag laws are designed to leave decision-making with local authorities. Often, the rate of usage depends on the enthusiasm of local law enforcement leaders. “You can usually trace that back to what I’ll call an ERPO implementation champion … somebody who just sees this law as a real opportunity to increase community safety,” she told CPR News in November. Colorado’s law, she said, had faced unusual resistance from some in law enforcement. In El Paso County, law enforcement had filed only two petitions under the law, despite having a population similar to Denver’s. El Paso is one of a number of conservative counties that vowed to oppose the ERPO law as it was approved in 2019, declaring themselves “Second Amendment sanctuaries” or “preservation” counties. Leaders there saw the law as an unjust intrusion on gun rights. Agencies’ reluctance to use ERPO has come under scrutiny since the Club Q shooting. The former sheriff has defended the decision not to seek an order against the accused shooter, who had been arrested a year earlier after a standoff with police. The sheriff’s office said a red-flag order would have been redundant, since the authorities confiscated and kept the suspect’s guns during the earlier criminal case. However, an order also would have barred the suspect from buying new guns. Spokespeople for the Colorado Springs Police Department and El Paso County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to requests for interviews. “Red flags” have been used much less often in Colorado than in several other states. In all, judges ordered 168 different people to relinquish their guns for a year or longer. That amounts to about 3.7 orders for every 100,000 adults, CPR News found. An AP investigation found much higher rates of usage in some other states with similar laws. For comparison, Florida leads the nation in red flag orders — issuing ten times more, accounting for population, than Colorado had over a recent period. The slower rate of adoption has happened, in part, because of many Colorado police departments’ infrequent use of the law.

revitalize the coverage of local news in places where it has waned. Led by the Chicago-based MacArthur Foundation, the new initiative, called Press Forward, seeks to nurture and sustain new models for funding journalism as the industry has come under severe financial pressures. In its announcement Thursday, the group of more than 20 charitable organizations noted that about a fifth of the nation live in so-called ""news deserts"" with little or no reliable coverage of major local developments. ""There is a crisis in local news,"" says John Palfrey, president of the MacArthur Foundation. ""The fact that so many newspapers are going out of business, that there are so many news deserts across America, that it poses such a threat to our democracy [means] that we had to do something at scale to be helpful."" Penny Abernathy, a visiting journalism professor at Northwestern University who studies the local news industry, has found that 2,500 newspapers — more than a quarter in the U.S. — have gone out of business since 2005. Such a loss is accompanied by a rise in corporate and government corruption and a drop in voter participation, research indicates. Misinformation can arise from outlets that appear to offer the news yet have hidden agendas. The MacArthur Foundation gives more than $30 million annually to help support PBS, NPR and other journalism ventures. Those efforts will continue. ""We realized even if we just doubled what we were doing for journalism and media, it would not be enough,"" Palfrey says. He expects his foundation will ultimately contribute at least $175 million toward the Press Forward initiative over the five years. Other major participants include the Ford Foundation, Knight Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation of New York, as well as groups with more localized focus or specific interests. (Some of the other philanthropies are also financial supporters of NPR.) Groups will either direct money through a centralized fund or issue grants independently. ""As some things go away, other things are cropping up,"" Palfrey says. ""We feel that we can both support very strong existing organizations and efforts and we can help feed the next generation of sustainable news organizations."" First grants are to be awarded later this year. Smaller philanthropies will participate as well, including the Lenfest Institute for Journalism, which owns the Philadelphia Inquirer and has helped other papers convert to not-for-profit status. The Archewell Foundation, established by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will also take part. This is not the first effort to infuse big dollar amounts into local news. The Knight Foundation previously devoted $300 million in grants over five years. Google and Meta (formerly Facebook) each launched their own nine-figure investments in news. The two digital giants have often been blamed for scooping up content from news outlets and siphoning off advertising that previously helped pay for that original journalism. The tech companies\' money subsidized some well-regarded initiatives but has not notably altered the landscape. And Google and Meta have stepped back from some of their partnerships with news outlets. ""We\'ve failed 1,000 times. We\'ve failed all kinds of ways,"" says Alberto Ibargüen, the president and CEO of the Knight Foundation. ""An informed electorate, an engaged community, is core to a well-functioning democracy. I am very optimistic that if we have more experimentation, we will find a way."" Knight announced it would be contributing $150 million toward Press Forward plus an added $15 million for local news efforts. In recent years, there\'s been a new push, led by Steve Waldman, co-founder of Report for America, among others, for the federal and state governments to subsidize reporting on the local level. That has borne fruit in California, which funded a $25 million project paying for stipends for reporters through the University of California at Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism, and in New Jersey, which has allocated $5.5 million through a consortium of six college campuses there. There is some bipartisan support for a bill in Congress that would allow generous tax deductions for outlets hiring reporters. And there are innovations happening in the industry. Older digital outlets such as the Voice of San Diego and the Texas Tribune have been joined by others such as the non-profit Baltimore Banner; Report for America has placed dedicated reporters in existing and upstart newsrooms around the country; the American Journalism Project has helped news outlets refine their business strategies; the National Trust for News has enabled the acquisition of news organizations by not-for profits. Last year, Chicago Public Media acquired the Chicago Sun-Times after the paper suffered years of steep revenue drops; the MacArthur Foundation was a major financial backer for the deal. Ibargüen says the new philanthropic push will serve to bolster, accelerate and expand such efforts, while acknowledging they may not prove to be a panacea for the industry. (The Texas Tribune, for example, unexpectedly laid off 10 percent of its staff this summer, adding to a sizeable list of news outlets that recently have slashed jobs.) ""You cannot have news reporting if you don\'t have reporters - and you can\'t have reporters if you cannot afford to pay them,"" Ibargüen says. ""We\'ve been on a search to look: What\'s the model?"" Ibargüen says the initiatives\' leaders hope to bring other national and local philanthropies on board, along with major digital platforms. He thinks a billion dollars — double the new commitment — is possible over five years. The industry has been beset by a trio of challenges: the consolidations of major advertisers; the massive shift in audiences\' reading habits from paper to digital and a comparative unwillingness to pay for news online; and key owners\' relentless drive for profits. Many major newspaper groups — including Gannett, McClatchy, and the old Tribune and MediaNews publications — are now controlled by investment funds which have embarked on severe rounds of repeated cuts. In the case of the two latter groups, it\'s Alden Global Capital, which has been criticized as a ""vulture capitalist"" outfit. (Alden rejects that description, arguing it has acquired papers no one else has figured out how to make money consistently from.) Many of these papers, once considered the lifeblood of news coverage in their areas, are now hollowed-out shells of their former selves. While Palfrey says for-profit news outlets may receive some of the Press Forward funds, the nature of their ownership would be weighed carefully. ""The chance that we would support a hedge fund-supported newspaper is very, very low,"" Palfrey says. ""One of the reasons we\'re in this predicament is greed. And one of the reasons we\'re in this predicament is capitalism run amok. And I think that we\'re not going to be propping up organizations that may or may not have made good choices in that corporate setting."" Palfrey calls the philanthropic funding ""seed money,"" not charity. ""What is exciting about this moment - against the backdrop of genuine crisis - is the innovation that\'s occurring,"" Palfrey says. ""And we want to support those social entrepreneurs, those journalists, those editors who are figuring out new ways to provide local news to every community in America."" Copyright 2023 NPR.
