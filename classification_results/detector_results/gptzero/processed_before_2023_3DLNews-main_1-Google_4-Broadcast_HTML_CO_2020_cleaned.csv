First, that diseases like measles are resurging, and they’re serious. (He’d know. He’s treated patients with complications from measles and pertussis.) Second, due to COVID-19, children are missing well-child visits and skipping vaccinations, putting them at risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. He didn’t expect to spend most of his time at the hearing countering misinformation about retracted studies on the impact of vaccination on African American boys, or refuting connections opponents made to the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment, a decades-long study in which government researchers withheld treatment from Black men with syphilis. That is, he said, “Not until I found out Kennedy was coming.” That’s Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a well known anti-vaccine activist. Then, said Washington, who is chief medical officer at the Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children and Presbyterian/St. Luke’s Medical Center, “My main goal in testifying was to dispel the racial innuendos that are being presented related to immunizations and particularly in the Black population.” Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. was the first witness to speak against the bill Sunday. As ABC News reported in the fall, Kennedy and other “anti-vaccine leaders have their sights focused on a new target: they’re infiltrating minority groups with existing skepticism of the medical establishment and exploiting the historically fraught relationships those groups have with doctors.” Studies have repeatedly shown that the majority of parents accept vaccines. But the sliver of people vehemently opposed to vaccination appear to be shifting their focus. In September, news outlets noticed that anti-vaccine protesters – most of them white – were taking on the language of the civil rights movement to promote their cause, even singing “We Shall Overcome” at the California Capitol when the state got rid of non-medical exemptions for childhood immunizations there. In October, public health experts were worried when civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton organized a forum on vaccination featuring anti-vaccination activists (in the end, it was canceled). In November, as ABC News reported, Kennedy tried to “enlist” the writer Harriet Washington to speak out against vaccines, and “all signs point to an effort to undermine the Black community’s fragile relationship with doctors.” This past weekend, as Black Lives Matter protesters took to Denver for the eleventh day in a row, it was evident that anti-vaccine activists’ message is resonating in Colorado, too. “I don’t generally align with conservatives, especially in the age of Trump. We have deep disagreements about the direction of the country and what the problems are. But I find myself aligned with them on this one,” said Theo Wilson, an activist and writer who spoke against the bill on Sunday. ""There\'s been a concerted effort to get the message into the African American community."" Senate Bill 163 would change the mechanics of how parents opt out of routine vaccines for their school-aged children. In a state with the lowest-on-record kindergarten rate of vaccination against illnesses including measles and chickenpox in the country, the bill would require parents to get a certificate signed by a health professional, or to do a “short online class” about vaccines, as states like Utah have already done. It would also require schools to publish their vaccination and exemption rate and distribute it to parents and students. At a February hearing about the Colorado bill, Wilson wrote in an opinion piece in the Colorado Sun that he was “one of the few Black faces” present. “The other African Americans I saw gave testimonies that supported Senate Bill 163, encouraging the unbroken partyline of Democrat support for the bill.” Sunday, at least four of the couple dozen people speaking against the bill were Black. “Black Americans not lending your voice to this...I am deeply offended,” said Kevin Jenkins, with the Urban Global Health Alliance. “Black Americans have a history of being lied to in this country.

NPR’s Steve Inskeep explained on Morning Edition… “When a boulder fell on a Colorado highway, the San Miguel County Sheriff’s Office responded with a warning. A tweet said the road was blocked by ‘a large boulder the size of a small boulder’. They meant to say the size of a small car, but Twitter is unforgiving. One person offered thanks that it wasn’t a large boulder the size of a large boulder, and another named the rock, Biggie Smalls…” says Inskeep. By Wednesday afternoon the tweet had been liked over 200 thousand times, with close to 40,000 retweets. That’s up from the 2 to 6 retweets Lilly says the Sheriff’s Twitter page typically gets for a post. So what’s it like to be the person behind the viral tweet? Lilly says, “At first I was embarrassed, ‘how could I do this? Oh my gosh’. I remember rereading and checking it, and of course my eyes say ‘small car’ not ‘small boulder’, so I thought all was good, until I realized it wasn’t. But now I’m just kind of entertained like the rest of you, but maybe in a slightly different way…you know, we wish we were that creative, to have used humor to get our message across, but it was, in fact, an error.” The viral tweet inspired memes and witty retorts. One twitter user commented “Americans really will use any other system of measurement than metric, won’t they?” Another asked “Who would win in a fight? A large boulder sized small boulder or 20 small boulder sized large boulder?” “I saw another that said, ‘I read it five times and every time I’m brought to tears laughing’. I don’t think it’s that funny, I think it’s kind of humorous, it’s kind of funny. But if you get pleasure out of that, then ‘you’re welcome’” Lilly says. Looking for the silver lining, Lilly says the tweet has helped spread her original message. Lilly notes, “Aside from providing people with cheap laughs, it was really an opportunity to push public safety information, like ‘watch out for boulders, watch out for obstacles in the road’. You know, we’re happy about that. If it reminds people to be a little more careful on the roadway, all is great. Especially since it came at no cost. No one was injured in making the tweet.” Lilly says the Sheriff’s Office isn’t currently planning to memorialize the boulder in any way, but if you’re driving Highway 145 towards Telluride. Take a peek of the side of the road, and you may see a boulder. Known to some as Biggie Smalls. KOTO FM Radio (970) 728-4333 | (970) 728-4334 P.O. Box 1069 | 207 N. Pine St. Telluride, CO 81435'}]"

Now, nearly a century after the original Colorado River Compact was forged, river stakeholders also find themselves in alien terrain as they try to reconcile an old management scheme with new realities, such as tribal rights, environmental protection and, especially, climate change. \'The Pie is Getting Smaller\' About 40 million people in seven states and Mexico rely on the Colorado for irrigation, drinking and even hydropower. Most of the water is used in agriculture to irrigate more than 5.5 million acres. Meanwhile, the Colorado is shrinking. Average river flows have dropped 19 percent over the last century. About half of the decline is blamed on global warming, and scientists project that unchecked climate change could nearly triple flow reductions by the century\'s end. Meanwhile, basin tribes want to tap into allocations they haven\'t been able to use because they lack means to store and pipe the water. And thanks to research mandated by the 1992 Grand Canyon Protection Act, the fate of the chub and the canyon ecology are factors that will also need to be considered in the yet-to-be-scheduled negotiations. Ultimately, everyone\'s worried about losing their share of the Colorado River, of going home with partly empty buckets because there\'s just not enough water to go around. ""The pie is getting smaller,"" said Jack Schmidt, director of the Utah State University\'s Center for Colorado River Studies , noting that more users sharing less water increases pressure to revamp water agreements. To understand what he means, here\'s a quick primer on Colorado River allocations beginning with the term ""acre feet."" It\'s roughly the water needed to fill a football field a foot deep or about 326,000 gallons. Under original agreements, including the Colorado River Compact, Schmidt\'s ""pie"" amounted to 17.5 million acre feet of water, which has proven to be an overestimation of ""average"" flows because the calculation was made when the river was unusually full. So over the last two decades, thanks in part to climate change and drought, the size of that pie has shrunk to an average annual flow of about 12.5 million acre feet. In short, the pie is about one-third smaller on average than when water users divvied up the river.

And, although he says environmental concerns in the canyon typically have been ""an afterthought"" in how the river is managed, he hopes the research becomes central during upcoming negotiations. Opportunities to tinker with river management plans are coming up fast. Water Rights: A Dramatic Struggle The U.S. Interior Department must begin updating plans for managing the river, and convene all the states that rely on it, by the end of the year under the Colorado River Interim Guidelines , one of the agreements that determine how much water is allocated for each stakeholder to use or develop. Like everything about Colorado River management, it\'s legally complex and controlled by a deeply entrenched power structure involving the seven basin states, the federal Bureau of Reclamation and established users in agriculture and municipalities that have assigned positions in the line to the spigot-spots known as ""water rights."" Dry as it might sound, it\'s dramatic stuff, grist for a neo-noir thriller like the 1974 film, Chinatown. But even the guidelines, which were implemented in 2007, have fallen short in the new, drier West. Last year, Congress approved a pair of Drought Contingency Plans , requiring varying levels of conservation to be implemented, state-by-state, whenever water levels sank too low at Lake Powell or Lake Mead, the ginormous storage reservoirs for Colorado River water. Both lakes dropped to emergency levels within months. The original compact guarantees certain water volumes to the lower basin states-Arizona, Nevada and California. The upper basin states-Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico-historically haven\'t used all of their allocations but plan to develop theirs, too. For example, Utah is pressing forward with a multibillion-dollar project to pipe 86,000 acre feet halfway across the state to the fast-growing southwestern part of the state. A diversion of water from the Utah-Wyoming border to Colorado\'s populous Front Range-killed and resurrected so many times it\'s called the ""zombie pipeline"" -would use 55,000 acre feet. Still, Schmidt said: ""I am actually very hopeful. I believe that climate change and the real need to renegotiate agreements have brought us together."" The role of global warming as a motivator for revisiting the water allocations probably can\'t be overstated. The average temperature in the Southwest has already risen twice as fast as the global average and future temperatures are projected to increase as much as 9.5 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. Climate change is just one reason Daryl Vigil, water director for the Jicarilla Apache Nation and interim director of the Ten Tribes Partnership, is determined to see tribes at the table in the next round of negotiations. He says the 29 basin tribes have priority rights to about 20 percent of the Colorado River\'s water but were snubbed by current users from past Colorado River talks.
