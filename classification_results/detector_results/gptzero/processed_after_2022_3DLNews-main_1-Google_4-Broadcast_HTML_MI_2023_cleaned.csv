Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) during an appearance in her congressional district — marking a rare instance of Biden directly targeting what he often pegs as a “MAGA Republican” by name. While Biden has spent much of this year traveling to and fundraising in affluent, safe-blue enclaves during domestic travel, his tour of wind tower manufacturer CS Wind in Pueblo, Colo., part of the state’s massive 3rd Congressional District that Boebert represents, gave a potential glimpse into his general election strategy. It is the type of stop the president is likely to make more frequently as the campaign season heats up in 2024 and as he seeks to contrast himself with the Trump wing of the GOP, particularly when it comes to his economic agenda. Despite polls indicating Americans are not feeling the impacts of an improving economy, the president has argued his plan, Bidenomics, is working, and the proof is in the low unemployment rate and job creation. The White House chose the CS Wind plant as an example of one expanding its operations and creating hundreds of jobs as a result of Biden’s signature Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Biden on Wednesday called Boebert “one of the leaders of this extreme MAGA movement” and gave himself the sign of the cross when he first mentioned her during the speech, noting she voted against the IRA. “She called this law a massive failure. Do you all know you’re part of a massive failure? Tell that to the 850 Coloradans who are getting new jobs in Pueblo at CS Winds thanks to this law. Tell that to the local economy who’s going to benefit from these investments. Tell that to anyone who wants to listen,” Biden said. The president touted the IRA and how it has benefited the economy and the environment through incentives for clean energy. He also boasted about investments in broadband for rural communities and bipartisan legislation signed last year that bolstered investments in domestic semiconductor chip manufacturing. Biden noted Boebert voted against the latter. Toward the end of the president’s speech, workers from CS Wind joined him on the stage, and Biden put his hand on one of their shoulders. “There are a quarter of a million more jobs in Colorado since I took office. That’s a quarter of a million more people throughout this state — including in this district — who can look their kids in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be OK,’” Biden said. “When we invest in our people and we strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth for all Americans.” Biden was set to visit Pueblo in October, but the trip was postponed in the aftermath of the Hamas attacks against Israel. The originally planned visit came on the heels of Biden mocking Boebert in August when highlighting that CS Wind was constructing a plant in her district. “Like in Colorado, where CS Wind broke ground on what will be the world’s largest wind tower manufacturing plant. And coincidentally, CS Wind is Congresswoman Lauren Boebert — you know, the very quiet Republican lady — it’s in her district,” Biden said. Biden added that Boebert, “along with every other Republican, voted against this bill — and it’s making all this possible. And she railed against its passage. But, that’s OK, she’s welcoming it now.” Boebert is one of several GOP members Biden has mocked for touting new projects in their districts after they voted against the legislation that provided federal funding for them. The second-term congresswoman is one of the most high-profile and controversial members of the House Republican Conference, and she is a widely outspoken critic of Biden. She shouted out during Biden’s 2022 State of the Union address to criticize the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, and she filed articles of impeachment against the president in June. The congresswoman was at the center of controversy in September after being escorted out of “Beetlejuice: The Musical” in Denver after complaints she and another attendee were vaping and disturbing the production. Boebert is likely to be a top target for Democrats in the 2024 elections given she narrowly won her seat in 2022. Boebert defeated Democrat Adam Frisch by fewer than 600 votes last November in one of the most surprising results of the midterms. Frisch has already announced he is challenging Boebert again next fall. Biden made a point to talk about Boebert in remarks to high-dollar donors the night before his visit to CS Wind, while he was touting the IRA. “[She] vowed to repeal it. And she voted to repeal it, and she called it a massive failure. It’s in her district. She called it a massive failure,” the president said Tuesday at a fundraiser just south of Denver.

""There was a 67% spike in the number of Michiganders who didn\'t have enough food over just one week period,"" says Berg. He says he attributes the current hunger problems our nation faces to the end of the pandemic relief. More money was given to communities to address hunger, people got more snap benefits and that all went away. Berg says food banks can only do so much when it comes to addressing this issue. “We really need to focus not just on charities filling in the gaps, but ensuring higher wages,"" says Berg. It’s not just adults going hungry kids also are faced with food insecurity. In Michigan, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed into law free breakfast and lunch for all public school students in grades K-12. Berg says that is a start but more needs to be done. ""This really needs to be a wake up call that our federal, state and local officials our business leaders have to get serious about finally ending this problem,"" he says. Berg says he hopes to see benefits that were added during the pandemic brought back and permanent, he also does believe that raising wages will help this hunger crisis.'}]"

Calling New York City and Chicago ""crime dens,"" the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination told his audience, ""The next time, I\'m not waiting. One of the things I did was let them run it and we\'re going to show how bad a job they do,"" he said. ""Well, we did that. We don\'t have to wait any longer."" Trump has not spelled out precisely how he might use the military during a second term, although he and his advisers have suggested they would have wide latitude to call up units. While deploying the military regularly within the country\'s borders would be a departure from tradition, the former president already has signaled an aggressive agenda if he wins, from mass deportations to travel bans imposed on certain Muslim-majority countries. A law first crafted in the nation\'s infancy would give Trump as commander in chief almost unfettered power to do so, military and legal experts said in a series of interviews. The Insurrection Act allows presidents to call on reserve or active-duty military units to respond to unrest in the states, an authority that is not reviewable by the courts. One of its few guardrails merely requires the president to request that the participants disperse. ""The principal constraint on the president\'s use of the Insurrection Act is basically political, that presidents don\'t want to be the guy who sent tanks rolling down Main Street,"" said Joseph Nunn, a national security expert with the Brennan Center for Justice. ""There\'s not much really in the law to stay the president\'s hand."" A spokesman for Trump\'s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment about what authority Trump might use to pursue his plans. Congress passed the act in 1792, just four years after the Constitution was ratified. Nunn said it\'s an amalgamation of different statutes enacted between then and the 1870s, a time when there was little in the way of local law enforcement. ""It is a law that in many ways was created for a country that doesn\'t exist anymore,"" he said. It also is one of the most substantial exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits using the military for law enforcement purposes. Trump has spoken openly about his plans should he win the presidency, including using the military at the border and in cities struggling with violent crime. His plans also have included using the military against foreign drug cartels, a view echoed by other Republican primary candidates such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor. The threats have raised questions about the meaning of military oaths, presidential power and who Trump could appoint to support his approach. Trump already has suggested he might bring back retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who served briefly as Trump\'s national security adviser and twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during its Russian influence probe before being pardoned by Trump. Flynn suggested in the aftermath of the 2020 election that Trump could seize voting machines and order the military in some states to help rerun the election. Attempts to invoke the Insurrection Act and use the military for domestic policing would likely elicit pushback from the Pentagon, where the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is Gen. Charles Q. Brown. He was one of the eight members of the Joint Chiefs who signed a memo to military personnel in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The memo emphasized the oaths they took and called the events of that day, which were intended to stop certification of Democrat Joe Biden\'s victory over Trump, ""sedition and insurrection."" Trump and his party nevertheless retain wide support among those who have served in the military. AP VoteCast, an in-depth survey of more than 94,000 voters nationwide, showed that 59% of U.S. military veterans voted for Trump in the 2020 presidential election. In the 2022 midterms, 57% of military veterans supported Republican candidates. Presidents have issued a total of 40 proclamations invoking the law, some of those done multiple times for the same crisis, Nunn said. Lyndon Johnson invoked it three times — in Baltimore, Chicago and Washington — in response to the unrest in cities after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. During the Civil Rights era, Presidents Johnson, John F. Kennedy and Dwight Eisenhower used the law to protect activists and students desegregating schools. Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to Little Rock, Arkansas, to protect Black students integrating Central High School after that state\'s governor activated the National Guard to keep the students out. George H.W. Bush was the last president to use the Insurrection Act, a response to riots in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Black motorist Rodney King in an incident that was videotaped. Repeated attempts to invoke the act in a new Trump presidency could put pressure on military leaders, who could face consequences for their actions even if done at the direction of the president. Michael O\'Hanlon, director of research in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution think tank, said the question is whether the military is being imaginative enough with the scenarios it has been presenting to future officers. Ambiguity, especially when force is involved, is not something military personnel are comfortable with, he said. ""There are a lot of institutional checks and balances in our country that are pretty well-developed legally, and it\'ll make it hard for a president to just do something randomly out of the blue,"" said O\'Hanlon, who specializes in U.S. defense strategy and the use of military force. ""But Trump is good at developing a semi-logical train of thought that might lead to a place where there\'s enough mayhem, there\'s enough violence and legal murkiness"" to call in the military. Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan of New York, the first graduate of the U.S. Military Academy to represent the congressional district that includes West Point, said he took the oath three times while he was at the school and additional times during his military career. He said there was extensive classroom focus on an officer\'s responsibilities to the Constitution and the people under his or her command. ""They really hammer into us the seriousness of the oath and who it was to, and who it wasn\'t to,"" he said. Ryan said he thought it was universally understood, but Jan. 6 ""was deeply disturbing and a wakeup call for me."" Several veterans and active-duty military personnel were charged with crimes in connection with the assault. While those connections were troubling, he said he thinks those who harbor similar sentiments make up a very small percentage of the military. William Banks, a Syracuse University law professor and expert in national security law, said a military officer is not forced to follow ""unlawful orders."" That could create a difficult situation for leaders whose units are called on for domestic policing, since they can face charges for taking unlawful actions. ""But there is a big thumb on the scale in favor of the president\'s interpretation of whether the order is lawful,"" Banks said. ""You\'d have a really big row to hoe and you would have a big fuss inside the military if you chose not to follow a presidential order."" Nunn, who has suggested steps to restrict the invocation of the law, said military personnel cannot be ordered to break the law. ""Members of the military are legally obliged to disobey an unlawful order. At the same time, that is a lot to ask of the military because they are also obliged to obey orders,"" he said.

At the same time, multiple candidates saw a slight uptick in support in the aftermath of the debate, which took place Wednesday in Milwaukee. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley saw the largest boost, with her support jumping from 2 percent to 7 percent after the debate. The poll found Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at 12 percent, up 2 percentage points from before the debate. Former Vice President Mike Pence got 7 percent support in the poll, up from 3 percent before the debate. The poll found that 27 percent of voters felt entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy won the debate last week, but it did not immediately translate to an increase in his support, which dropped from 10 percent to 9 percent in the Emerson poll. The poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points. The findings indicate Trump may pay a price with some Republican primary voters for his decision to skip the first debate, though it’s difficult to tell from one survey, and he maintains a commanding lead over the field. He instead opted to record an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, which was published on social media at the same time the debate began. Trump has indicated he plans to skip future debates, as well, pointing to his large lead in GOP primary polls and questioning why he should subject himself to attacks from other candidates when he is ahead by roughly 30 percentage points in many national polls. “While Trump saw a slight dip in support, the question from this poll is whether this is a blip for Trump or if the other Republican candidates will be able to rally enough support to be competitive for the caucus and primary season,” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said in a statement.

The end of the cease-fire came after Hamas freed over 100 of the more than 200 people its militants took hostage during the Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel. In exchange, Israel released more than 200 Palestinians from Israeli prisons. Here’s how the news is developing. All times Eastern: Dec 19, 8:49 PM EST Palestinian Islamic Jihad releases video of 2 Israeli hostages The Palestinian Islamic Jihad released a video on Tuesday of two Israeli hostages pleading for their release. The men — who identified themselves as Gadi Moses and Elad Katzir — spoke as they appeared in front of a plain background in the nearly 2 1/2-minute video. “I want to convey to my friends and supporters that we must increase the pressure so that the government understands what we want,” Moses said in the video provided by the hostage-takers. “We want every effort to be made so that we will soon arrive back home to our friends, our family, to our home.” Addressing Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel Defense Forces Commander Hertzi Halevi, Moses said he feared being killed by an Israeli bomb. “This situation where we could die at any moment is an unbearable situation; there is a reasonable chance that we will also be killed tonight,” he said. Katzir, 47, also said the bombings “endanger our lives” and urged Israeli leaders to make a prisoner exchange deal. “We don’t want to die in Gaza,” he said. “We want them to do whatever it takes to bring us home.” It is unclear when the video was recorded and if the men were told what to say. The hostages’ families gave ABC News permission to use stills from the video. Dec 19, 2:54 PM EST 1,500 tunnel shafts, underground passages found in Gaza since start of war The Israel Defense Forces said it’s found about 1,500 tunnel shafts and underground passages in Gaza since the start of the war. The IDF — which has consistently accused Hamas of using civilians in Gaza as human shields — said most tunnels were under schools, hospitals, mosques, United Nations facilities and civilian institutions. -ABC News’ Dana Savir Dec 19, 2:31 PM EST 40 trucks carrying commercial goods cross into Gaza for 1st time since war began Forty trucks carrying commercial goods crossed into the Gaza Strip on Tuesday — the first time commercial goods entered since the war began, Palestinian border crossing spokesman Wael Abu Omar told ABC News. The trucks — carrying items including flour, oil and salt — entered through Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing, the spokesman said. -ABC News’ Ayat Al-Tawy Dec 19, 1:00 PM EST Israeli president: ‘Israel is ready for another humanitarian pause’ Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Tuesday that “Israel is ready for another humanitarian pause and additional humanitarian aid in order to enable the release of hostages.” Herzog said to achieve this, “the responsibility lies fully with [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar and the leadership of Hamas.” “It is really important for us to reiterate — we are not fighting the people of Gaza. They are not our enemies,” the president said. “We are fighting Hamas, they are the enemy. And in this respect, we are taking all possible humanitarian steps according to international humanitarian law.” Herzog said the amount of humanitarian aid for hard-hit Gaza “can be tripled instantaneously.” “For the last two weeks, Israel has operated new scanning equipment in [the Israeli city of] Nitzana enabling the entry of 350 trucks a day. For the last two weeks there was a failure by the United Nations predominantly, and other partners, in the inflow of trucks into Gaza — only about 125 or 100 trucks a day,” he said. “You can triple the amount of trucks easily, if there was only an effort by the United Nations and its partners. The world has to know that you could have had tens of thousands of tons a day more going into Gaza.” The U.N. has not commented.

So, let’s get to the news. The United Auto Workers’ strike against Detroit’s Big Three automakers is heating up as it enters its sixth week, and as talks get narrower. The UAW’s nationwide strike at Stellantis, General Motors and Ford Motor Company has lasted longer than a month without a union-approved deal on the table -- though each company has submitted numerous offers that have inched increasingly closer to the union’s demands. UAW President Shawn Fain said last week that serious progress was made recently, but it’s still not enough to put an end to the picket lines. The strike grew Monday morning as both sides yearn for an agreement that will allow a return to normalcy. Here’s a breakdown of where things stand in week six. Sanders, the iconic Detroit candy brand, says one of its most popular products may not be on shelves soon. Learn more here. ClickOnDetroit’s Derick Hutchinson reports: The next time Michigan takes the field, there will be a shiny new ranking next to its name, as the first College Football Playoff rankings come out one week from today. But where will the committee rank the Wolverines? I genuinely have no idea, because I could justify them as the No. 1 team or outside the top five entirely. Read more here. Rapidly expanding Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip killed more than 700 people in the past day as medical facilities across the territory were forced to close because of bombing damage and a lack of power, health officials said Tuesday. The soaring death toll from Israel’s escalating bombardment was unprecedented in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It could signal an even greater loss of life in Gaza once Israeli ground forces backed by tanks and artillery launch an expected offensive into the territory aimed at crushing Hamas. See more here.

Another group of hostages was released by Hamas late Saturday, officials said, after hours of delay and indications the temporary truce between Israel and Hamas could be breaking down. Close to midnight local time, the Israeli military said its troops were were with the hostages and they were being taken for medical assessments and will be reunited with their families at Israeli hospitals. The hostages include about a dozen Israeli citizens and several foreign nationals who had been held captive seven weeks since Hamas\' October 7 attack in Israel, according Majed Al Ansari, a spokesman for the Qatari foreign ministry. ""After a delay, obstacles to release of prisoners were overcome through Qatari-Egyptian contacts with both sides,"" Al Ansari said in a post to social media. The Palestinians being released from jails are 33 children and six women, he said, while the Israeli hostages released are eight children and five women. Hamas said earlier Saturday that the amount of humanitarian aid flowing into Gaza was not as much as had been promised, and that not enough of it was reaching the northern part of the territory, which had been the focal point of fighting before the cease-fire. “This is putting the deal in danger and we have spoken mediators about that,” Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, said in Beirut. Friday saw the successful exchange of 24 hostages for 39 prisoners, a relief for family members who had anxiously awaited any news of their loved ones since Hamas\' October 7 attack. No Americans were among the captives released on Friday, when the temporary cease-fire first went into effect. President Joe Biden has said Americans will be among the 50 hostages released but that it wasn’t clear when. Brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, the deal called for a four-day pause in fighting and the release of 50 hostages held by Hamas in exchange for 150 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Many, if not all of those released from both sides will be women and children. Israel also agreed to extend the fighting pause one day for every 10 additional hostages Hamas releases. Israel has vowed to resume its offensive after the truce, though Biden has expressed hope for an extension of the truce. More than 13,300 Palestinian people have been killed since Oct. 7, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. That does not include updated numbers from hospitals in the north, where communications have broken down. The ministry says some 6,000 people have been reported missing, feared buried under rubble. Israeli officials said about 1,200 people have been killed, and an estimated 240 were taken hostage by Hamas. Relatives and friends of hostages pleaded with the international community on Saturday not to forget the plight of their loved ones during a Saturday press conference organized by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Among them was Alexandra Fridman, who is raising awareness for the missing, including Sapir Cohen and missing members of the Trupanob family. Fridman said she has a video of Cohen’s being brought into Gaza on a motorbike. “It’s heartbreaking,” she said. Hamas militants killed Vitaly Trupanob, 50, in the October 7 attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz. Cohen was taken alongside her boyfriend, Sacha, his mother, Elena, and his grandmother, Irina Trupanob. “Hamas took the whole family,” Fridman said. “We don’t know if they’re still alive.” Fridman said that they have no information about the condition of the missing. “I just know that Sapir went through a terrible journey and she’s going through – she and Sacha, and everyone is going through very rough times.” “I feel like every minute they spend there can be critical, because we already have some news about other hostages that are killed by Hamas,” Fridman said. “I really ask from the whole world, and you, to tell everyone our story and to help us bring everyone home. We want everyone home.” The United Nations will deliver over 50 trucks of humanitarian aid to Gaza on Saturday, according to the Israeli military, part of a larger humanitarian aid effort underway during the four-day cease-fire. Eight tankers carrying fuel and cooking gas entered Gaza Saturday morning, the military said. “The fuel and cooking gas are designated for operating essential humanitarian infrastructure in Gaza,” according to COGAT, the Coordinator for Government Activities in the Territories, an Israeli agency that coordinates with the Palestinians on civilian issues. The agency said four tankers carrying fuel and four tankers carrying cooking gas were transferred from Egypt to UN humanitarian aid organizations in the southern Gaza Strip. The agency said that some 200 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered the Gaza Strip on Friday.

""We will not stop until all hostages are released by Hamas."" The Palestinians released from prison Friday including 15 teenagers jailed for offenses like throwing stones and 24 women, including some convicted of attempted murder for attacks on Israeli forces. Addameer, a Palestinian prisoner rights group, said there are 7,000 ""political prisoners"" in Israel. There are 2,070 ""administrative detainees,"" or people held indefinitely without charges. At least 200 of the people in prison are children and 62 are women, according to the organization. International and Palestinian human rights organizations have long alleged that Israel mistreats its child detainees, whom it prosecutes in military courts and holds for indefinite periods of time. Israel says they are detained for suspected terror-related offenses. One of the earliest proposals was put forward Oct. 12, and it called for releasing all women and children held by Hamas and other Palestinian militants in Gaza, in return for freeing all Palestinian women in Israeli prisons, according to Egyptian officials. The Israelis rejected that proposal, but it “opened the door for more talks,” an Egyptian official said. Contributing: Associated Press'}]"

FM Political reporters Jonathan Oosting and Craig Mauger discuss why Michigan is so closely tied to Trump’s legal troubles. Former President Donald Trump speaks during the Oakland County Republican Party's Lincoln Day Dinner, Sunday, June 25, 2023, in Novi, Mich. In a 45-page grand jury indictment of Donald Trump released earlier this week, Michigan is mentioned nearly 40 times, including an extensive section describing how Trump attempted to overturn the election in the state. Trump is the first former U.S. president to be indicted, and he’s being charged on a number of potential crimes, including hush money payments he made during his 2016 presidential campaign, the mishandling of classified documents, and four felony counts — including conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. The latest indictment claims Trump knowingly attempted to block the counting of votes in several states. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and says he is being targeted by Democrats to prevent him from reclaiming the presidency in 2024. Political reporters Jonathan Oosting and Craig Mauger joined Detroit Today to discuss why Michigan is so closely tied to Trump’s legal troubles. Listen: Why Michigan is at the epicenter of Trump’s recent indictment Guests Jonathan Oosting is an award-winning Michigan political reporter covering the Capitol for Bridge Michigan. He says the political consequences of Trump’s latest indictment has yet to be registered among voters. “We’ve learned a little bit more but I think there’s more to come,” says Oosting. Craig Mauger covers state government and politics for the Detroit News. He says many Michiganders don’t yet realize how deeply actions in the state tie to Trump’s latest indictment. “I think Michigan voters don’t realize how front and center Michigan is in this effort to hold individuals accountable to overturn the 2020 presidential election,” says Mauger.

In the effort to become a more “inclusive” society, we have instead become more intolerant of those whose values and beliefs don’t match our own.

We have changed, and if there is anything human nature doesn’t like, it’s change. Some of you might stump for change, thinking that it will be for the better, but when it does come, it’s not as what we expected, and we become resentful, bitter, disenchanted. The only way we can rise above how life is today … is to look beyond these days, to when we will all “exit, stage right.” For some of us, that day may be looming larger and larger, and for others, that day might come suddenly, when we least expect it. By putting life here and now in that perspective, we can take things in stride and not get caught up in the controversies and disputes of today. For me, I have put my faith and trust in my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and I am assured of what lies ahead after I pass through the portal of death. Many of you have that same assurance, while others may still be searching. I pray that more and more of you will stop, listen and learn in 2024, while you still can.
