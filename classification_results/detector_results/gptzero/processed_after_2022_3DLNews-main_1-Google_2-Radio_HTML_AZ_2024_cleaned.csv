(AP) — The mass shooting that unfolded amid throngs of people at the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl celebration appeared to stem from a dispute between several people, authorities said Thursday. Police Chief Stacey Graves said that the 22 people injured in the shooting ranged between the ages of 8 and 47 years old, half of whom were under the age of 16. A mother of two was also killed. Three people were detained — including two juveniles — but no charges have been filed yet, Graves said. Police are calling for witnesses, people with cellphone footage and victims of the violence to call a dedicated hotline. “We are working to determine the involvement of others. And it should be noted we have recovered several firearms. This incident is still a very active investigation,” Graves said at a news conference. The shooting outside Union Station occurred despite the presence of more than 800 police officers who were in the building and area, including on top of nearby structures, said Mayor Quinton Lucas, who attended with his wife and mother and ran for safety when the shots rang out. But he doesn’t expect to cancel the upcoming St. Patrick’s Day parade. “We have parades all the time. I don’t think they’ll end. Certainly we recognized the public safety challenges and issues that relate to them,” Lucas said. Throngs had lined the parade route before the shooting, with fans climbing trees and street poles or standing on rooftops for a better view. Players rolled through the crowd on double-decker buses, as DJs and drummers heralded their arrival. The police chief said the gun violence mostly unfolded on the west side of Union Station, addressing initial reports that shootings occurred in more than one location. Graves said 1 million people likely attended the Chief’s Super Bowl parade, which occurred in a city with a population of about 470,000 people and a metropolitan area of about 2 million, but stressed that the violence was wrought by just a handful of people. “The law enforcement response was exemplary. Those in attendance also responded,” Graves added. “They helped one another and even physically stop a person who was believed to be involved in the incident.” Meanwhile, police are still asking witnesses to come forward. Many have described a sense of confusion that rippled through the crowd. The rally had just ended and music was still blaring when the shots erupted. Many people initially thought they were hearing fireworks. But then chaos ensued. Some in the crowd hit the ground while others leapt over barriers and sprinted from the scene, some carrying children in their arms. The crowd was so massive that normalcy returned quickly, with some fans unsure what had happened. But it became clear there was a shooting as ambulances arrived and officers rushed in with guns drawn. Some of the less seriously injured were driven away on golf carts. The stunned crowd — some in tears — slowly gathered their belongings, trying to figure out how to get home. Strangers comforted each other as police put up crime scene tape in an area where moments early it had been a joyous celebration. Ashley Coderre, a 36-year-old from Overland Park, Kansas, said she heard two or three shots after walking out of a Panera near Crown Center, a couple blocks from Union Station. She said people were running and yelling. Then suddenly she said people were walking around like nothing had happened: “We were so confused.” Social media users posted shocking video of police running through Wednesday’s crowded scene. One video showed someone apparently performing chest compressions on a victim as another person, seemingly writhing in pain, lay on the ground nearby. People screamed in the background. Another video showed two people chase and tackle a person, holding them down until two police officers arrived. In an interview Thursday with ABC’s “Good Morning America,” Trey Filter of Wichita, Kansas, said he saw someone being chased and took action. “I couldn’t see much. I heard, ‘Get ’em!’ I saw a flash next to me. And I remember I jumped and remember thinking, ‘I hope this is the fool they were talking about,\'” he said. “They started yelling that, ‘There’s a gun! There’s a gun!’” Filter said he and another man kept the person pinned down until officers arrived. “I remember the officers pulling my feet off of him and at that point I was just looking for my wife and kids,” he said. It was not immediately clear if the person he held down was involved in the shooting, but Filter’s wife, Casey, saw a gun nearby and picked it up. The woman killed in the shooting was identified by radio station KKFI-FM as Lisa Lopez-Galvan, host of “Taste of Tejano.” Lopez-Galvan, whose DJ name was “Lisa G,” was an extrovert and devoted mother from a prominent Latino family in the area, said Rosa Izurieta and Martha Ramirez, two childhood friends who worked with her at a staffing company. “She’s the type of person who would jump in front of a bullet for anybody — that would be Lisa,” Izurieta said. Kansas City has long struggled with gun violence, and in 2020 it was among nine cities targeted by the U.S. Justice Department in an effort to crack down on violent crime. In 2023, the city matched a record with 182 homicides, most of which involved guns. Lucas has joined with mayors across the country in calling for new laws to reduce gun violence, including mandating universal background checks. “We did everything to make this event as safe as possible,” Lucas, a Democrat, said in an interview on KMBC-TV Thursday. “But as long as we have fools who will commit these types of acts, as long as we have their access to firearms with this level of capacity, then we may see incidents like this one.” University Health spokesperson Leslie Carto said two of the eight gunshot victims brought to the hospital are still in critical condition. One is in stable condition. The other five have been discharged. The hospital also treated four people from the rally who had nongunshot injuries. Three of those patients were discharged, Carto said. Stephanie Meyer, chief nursing officer for Children’s Mercy Kansas City, said it was treating 12 patients from the rally, including 11 children between the ages of 6 and 15, nine of whom suffered gunshot wounds. All were expected to recover, she said. When asked about the condition of the children, Meyer responded: “Fear. The one word I would use to describe what we saw and how they came to us was fear.” St. Luke’s Hospital spokesperson Emily Hohenberg said one gunshot victim at the hospital remains in critical condition. Four people who suffered injuries while fleeing the aftermath of the shooting were treated and released.

He encouraged them to come to a SCIF, a secure area, to review the intelligence. He again provided no details. Turner’s announcement appeared to catch the Biden administration off-guard. National security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House that he already had been due to brief Turner and other senior congressional intelligence leaders, known as the Gang of Eight, on Thursday. Sullivan did not disclose the topic or provide any other details related to Turner’s statement. “I’m focused on going to see him, sit with him as well as the other House members of the Gang of Eight, tomorrow,” Sullivan said. “And I’m not in a position to say anything further from this podium at this time.” He acknowledged it was not standard practice to offer such a briefing. “I’ll just say that I personally reached out to the Gang of Eight. It is highly unusual, in fact, for the national security adviser to do that,"" Sullivan said. He said he had reached out earlier this week. He would not say whether the briefing was related to Turner\'s warning. “I leave it to you to draw whatever connections you want,” he told reporters.

The Senate approved bipartisan aid which faces an uncertain future in the House. Republicans set the agenda there. And Donald Trump, the party leader, has said he opposes the measure. House Republicans now deciding what to do include Representative Andy Harris of Maryland. His mother immigrated from Ukraine, and Harris has served as co-chair of the House Ukraine Caucus supporting the fight against Russia. He is now critical of the $60 billion in Ukraine funding that passed the Senate. What changed for you? ANDY HARRIS: Well, I still support Ukraine funding to a limited extent, much more limited than before, because I think that our European colleagues should step up. They have stepped up recently, but I think they should be bearing the largest cost of this. And, you know, that's not true under the current circumstances and certainly not with the Senate package. INSKEEP: Well, let's think that through for a moment. Sixty billion dollars, that is a lot of money. But you've said it is important to resist Russia in Ukraine. It's got one of the world's largest militaries. It is putting all the force it can against Ukraine. Is that not a relatively small investment compared with losing Ukraine and endangering Europe? HARRIS: Well, again, the question is not, you know, whether or not we're going to be helpful to Ukraine. The question is how we go about it. What's the best way for the United States to approach it? And again, try to encourage our European allies to step up to the plate even more than they have. INSKEEP: Although, we're getting the impression that some members of the House want no funding at all. Your speaker attempted to move a bill that just had Israel funding and nothing for Ukraine, and he's voted against Ukraine funding in the past. HARRIS: I mean, some people don't want any funding at all. But I think if you presented this package the right way, especially if you combined it with some southern border elements, I think people would agree to it. INSKEEP: Well, I guess we should note, Senate Democrats and Republicans did try to come up with a border compromise. And one of the reasons that that fell apart was that Speaker Johnson said, this is not what I'm looking for at all. Donald Trump, your presidential candidate, urged it to be sunk. And it became clear that there was going to be no Ukraine funding if it had to be attached to a border package. Are you still insisting on that? HARRIS: Look, that's exactly why Speaker Johnson should have been involved in this negotiation from the beginning. The Senate passes a package and the House takes the position that, well, now it's our turn to decide what to do on this issue. And that's exactly what we'll do. INSKEEP: I just want to emphasize there, the U.S. has provided military aid, as you have said. And now the United States is providing less and less, and Ukrainians are short of ammunition while fighting one of the largest militaries in the world. And I'm hearing you saying you still need to negotiate a solution to the many years old border problem before you're willing to give any more funding to Ukraine. Is that right? HARRIS: That's right. Look, that's been the House position for quite a while now. And look, I'm surprised that, again, if Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell wanted this to be done as quickly as possible, they should have involved the House in the negotiations much, much earlier. INSKEEP: I'd like also to understand the conversations that take place within the Republican caucus. Surveys and interviews over time show that some Republicans, voters as well as lawmakers and influential people, are sympathetic to Russia's President Vladimir Putin. They think he is a Christian leader. They think he is a traditionalist. You speak with a lot of your fellow Republicans. How much of a factor is that in Republican Party thinking about Ukraine? HARRIS: I think almost none at all. Honestly, that's a Democrat talking point. The bottom line is we understand that Mr. Putin is probably not a very good person at all, that he is a threat. The question is, you know, on the policy level, is how to deal with that. INSKEEP: Although, I mean, you know, you can look at surveys and see that Republican support for Russia generally or favorable views of Russia generally, that those views have gone up over time as Donald Trump has spoken a certain way about Vladimir Putin. HARRIS: They may have gone up, but it's still nowhere near a majority of the Republican Party. INSKEEP: You said that $60 billion, which is the amount in the Senate bill, is too much, but that you would be willing to support some funding for Ukraine. Do you want to put a number on the table that would be fine with you? HARRIS: Yeah, I do. I think that, you know, Congress is in session 12 months out of the year. There's no reason we have to pass a bill that provides support for three years, as this bill does. We should pare it down to maybe $10 billion of the most necessary aid, combine that with some border policy, and then revisit the issue as we see how the war there progresses over the next several months with that aid package and move forward with that. INSKEEP: Is it necessary as a strategic matter to make sure that Russia knows the United States will support Ukraine in the long term and that Vladimir Putin can't just wait for money to run out or wait for an election result? HARRIS: Well, look, I think that always could be interpreted that way. But the bottom line is that if we take action now, the message will be sent to Vladimir Putin that we are going to continue to provide military aid. Let's take the first step. Let's go ahead and put it behind us. So I'm hoping that that might be one of the ideas that is considered. INSKEEP: Republican Representative Andy Harris of Maryland. Thanks for taking the time, sir.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: If you picture a map of Gaza, Rafah is at the very bottom at a border crossing to Egypt. It\'s now the refuge for people from all over the rest of Gaza who fled Israel\'s offensive in recent months. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told the army to prepare some kind of plan to evacuate more than 1 million civilians from Rafah, although it\'s not clear where they could go. FADEL: NPR\'s Eyder Peralta is following the story from Tel Aviv, and he joins us now. Good morning. EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Leila. FADEL: So let\'s start with these threats from Israel. Palestinians have been displaced multiple times over. Now, a majority of residents of the strip are in this small piece of land in the southernmost part of the Palestinian territory. Why is Israel now moving into this part of Gaza? PERALTA: Well, Israel says that it\'s going after Hamas. Remember, last October, Hamas launched an attack in southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people, and Israel vowed to destroy Hamas. And so far, they have swept from Gaza\'s north to itself. The bombing has killed some 28,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\'s health ministry. And in the past few days, Israel\'s defense minister and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say that Rafah, a city that, as you said, is along the border with Egypt, is Hamas\' final stronghold. Netanyahu was interviewed by ABC yesterday, and he reiterated that Israel was poised to launch a military operation at Rafah. Let\'s listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: Those who say that under no circumstances should we enter Rafah are basically saying lose the war, keep Hamas there. FADEL: And part of this may have already started. We\'re hearing reports of airstrikes this morning and some good news about hostages taken from Israel. What are you learning? PERALTA: So we know there\'s been an increase in airstrikes generally in Rafah. But the Israeli military says what happened overnight was about hostages and that the airstrikes were a diversionary tactic. The military says that they rescued two of the 136 hostages who Israel believe are still in Gaza, and they say both are in good condition. A hospital official tells NPR that at least 50 Palestinians were killed last night. NPR producer Anas Baba was on the street in Rafah. Let\'s listen. (SOUNDBITE OF SHELLING) ANAS BABA, BYLINE: It\'s very intensive shelling all around me. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE) BABA: Next to my house, there is Al-Huda. Al-Huda Mosque is one of the most known mosques all over Rafah, and it got bombed to pieces. Could you exactly tell me your name, please? AMZA NEDAL ABUL: Amza Nedal Abul (ph). BABA: Could you tell me what\'s happened exactly? ABUL: Every day we lose everything. We lose our family, we lose our health, we lose our mosques. We lose our children and our houses. You know, where\'s the humanity? I mean, where\'s the humanity? PERALTA: Where is the humanity, she keeps asking, where is the world? FADEL: OK, so let\'s ask that question. Where does the world stand on this? PERALTA: I mean, pretty much everyone - the U.S., the U.N., the EU, the U.K. - is warning Israel against moving into Rafah, and that\'s because Rafah is the last remaining relatively safe space for Palestinian refugees. Some 1.4 million Palestinians are now in Rafah. I spoke to Yousef Hammash, who works for the Norwegian Refugee Council, and he describes a desperate atmosphere. To the north you have bombing and hunger, and to the south you have Egypt, which does not want to take refugees. So everyone feels like they\'ve been painted into a corner, that there is nowhere to run. And if bombing begins, he says, it feels like the only choice you\'re left with is - the only choice you\'re left to make is how you want to die. It\'s worth noting that in a phone call, President Biden caution Prime Minister Netanyahu, saying that any military operation in Rafah should be accompanied by a credible plan to protect civilians. FADEL: That\'s NPR\'s Eyder Peralta reporting from Tel Aviv. Thank you, Eyder. PERALTA: Thank you, Leila. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Former President Trump has reignited questions about what he\'d do to U.S. alliances as president. INSKEEP: At a campaign rally, the ex-president told a rambling tale of a supposed conversation with the leader of an unnamed nation in NATO, the North Atlantic Alliance. Trump pictured himself saying that if the NATO ally didn\'t pay enough, he would not protect them against Russia. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills. (CHEERING) INSKEEP: The ex-president, who is famous for failing to pay his own bills, appeared to misspeak about the nature of the NATO alliance, whose members do not owe bills. The nations do commit to spend a percentage of their budgets on defense. They are also committed to defend one another and came to the United States\' defense when it was attacked in 2001. FADEL: NPR\'s Stephen Fowler in Atlanta was at the rally and joins us now. Good morning. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So Donald Trump says he would encourage Russia to, quote, ""do whatever the hell they want"" to NATO countries in Europe that, in his mind, aren\'t spending enough on defense. Pretty controversial statement to make at a time Russia\'s actively at war in Ukraine and NATO allies feel threatened. What\'s his message with this statement? FOWLER: Well, Leila, Trump has been critical of NATO for a while. That\'s not a new development. FADEL: True. FOWLER: I mean, in fact, his presidency was marked by consistently questioning the value of international alliances broadly and NATO specifically. I mean, he repeatedly threatened in private to withdraw the U.S. from the alliance and publicly harangued other global powers like Germany and France to contribute more to defense spending. Over the last decade, NATO members have aimed to increase spending levels to 2% of their GDP, and as of last year, only 11 of 31 countries hit that target. That includes the U.S., which spends about 3.5%. As we heard, Trump falsely implies there are countries that haven\'t paid their bills or owe the U.S. or NATO directly. I mean, it\'s not like a country club where there are dues to be considered a member, it\'s a club of countries that have promised to defend and protect each other from threats. So why more spending over the years? Russian aggression over the last decade, which is complicated by Trump\'s vocal support of Russia. FADEL: What\'s the reaction been to his comments? FOWLER: Well, the White House issued a rare statement late Saturday calling the comments, quote, ""unhinged,"" said it was promoting deranged chaos and stressed that the stance of President Joe Biden\'s administration is that NATO is the largest and most vital it\'s ever been. And of course, the campaign wants to make that front and center. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Sunday that any suggestion NATO allies would not honor the commitment to defend one another, quote, ""undermines all of our security."" Republicans in Congress largely shrugged it off as Trump being Trump. FADEL: An excuse we hear often from his Republican colleagues. So he\'s made a lot of people upset. Who is he appealing to here with these comments, Republican voters? FOWLER: Well, yes and no. I mean, remember, Trump isn\'t a fan of NATO. And if he\'s elected again, there\'s no telling what he would advocate for. But some of Trump\'s defenders do point out the veiled threat from his anecdote was ultimately successful because other European countries and NATO did start stepping up to the plate and beefing up their spending. There are GOP primary voters that want America\'s global footprint to retreat a little bit and focus more domestically, but this meandering message about NATO and funding and foreign policy is typical Trump. I mean, think stories where people say, sir. It was part of a nearly two-hour riff in front of his biggest supporters, but it didn\'t really make that much of an impact to the crowd. FADEL: That\'s NPR\'s Stephen Fowler in Atlanta. Thank you, Stephen. FOWLER: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FADEL: Now let\'s check a claim that\'s made in the immigration debate. Republicans who blocked a bipartisan immigration plan in Congress have been insisting it\'s not really needed. INSKEEP: House speaker Mike Johnson is among those making that assertion. The Republican leader has been saying that the president can close the border without the help of Congress. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE JOHNSON: I told President Biden this myself on multiple occasions, most recently a'}]"
