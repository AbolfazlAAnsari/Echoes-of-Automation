Minn. — The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service is tightening requirements imposed on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources when the state wants to cut trees in wildlife management areas. The federal agency is essentially asking the state to prove that any logging on WMAs has wildlife management as its primary purpose at each logging site and not simply cutting trees for the state’s timber industry. The feds say they will withhold money for each proposed project until the state proves the wildlife purpose. The new requirements are just the latest twist in an ongoing saga over how much, where and why timber should be cut on the state’s 1,440 public wildlife management areas, at least those that have trees. The state has another 700 aquatic management areas covering some 700 miles of shoreline on lakes and rivers, much of it forested. The debate impacts a relatively small amount of the state’s share of timber. Most of the state's DNR-managed timber comes from state forests and is not subject to the issues over wildlife management areas. ADVERTISEMENT The latest twist comes after the federal agency last year withheld some $21 million in federal sporting goods tax revenues from Minnesota because DNR officials hadn't satisfied federal requirements on managing the wildlife management areas. It’s those federal funds that are used to acquire and manage wildlife and aquatic management areas and that money is earmarked for wildlife and fish purposes only. Critics of the DNR’s logging policies in wildlife management areas say the agency had been ignoring its own wildlife managers over where, when and how logging should occur on the public lands. The added requirements imposed by the Fish & Wildlife Service should help keep the DNR on its pledged course of putting wildlife first in all logging projects on the public hunting areas. “There have never been site-specific requirements like this before in Minnesota,’’ said Craig Sterle, a former DNR forester who has been critical of the agency on the issue. “The two sides really aren’t that far apart when it comes down to how many acres (to be logged) are involved.

A federal agency official confirmed the letter but hasn't yet commented on the issue. Dave Olfelt, DNR Fish and Wildlife Division director, said the goal of the new conditions is documenting, in writing, the wildlife purposes of a particular logging project in a transparent way. This documentation does not increase or decrease the number of acres DNR will log, he noted. “DNR requested more precise language in the conditions, and the USFWS concurred that this would be helpful,’’ Olfelt said. “It’s important to understand that the conditions are not substantively different from those in our 2021 grant. Rather, they are more specific as to the documentation that is required, when in the process we provide that documentation and the process for the USFWS to review DNR’s documentation.” The issue has been festering for nearly five years as conservationists, including several current and retired DNR wildlife biologists, argue the DNR is planning to log too much and in the wrong places on some wildlife areas to benefit the timber industry, often to the detriment of wildlife habitat. ADVERTISEMENT Pressured by those critics, the Fish and Wildlife Service stepped in and issued orders to the state, including a lengthy letter of agreement signed by both sides last March scolding the DNR for dragging its feet on the issue. The dispute, first reported in the News Tribune in August 2019, began when top DNR officials began implementing a timber availability report that called for more trees to be cut on state lands to feed the state's timber industry, including more timber from wildlife management areas. The effort began under then-Gov. Mark Dayton, and top DNR officials have continued to press for more logging under Gov. Tim Walz. The effort called for increasing the state's share of wood for the industry from 800,000 cords annually to 870,000 cords, and asked for part of the increase to come from wildlife management areas. In a 2019 letter to Strommen, 28 DNR wildlife managers described any industry-aimed increase in logging on wildlife areas as scientifically dishonest. They said concerns raised by wildlife staff were being ignored by DNR forestry staff and top DNR officials. But Strommen has said that, while wildlife area logging will be included as part of the total state timber sold to the timber industry, the agency has no quotas on how much timber must come from wildlife management areas. She has called critics' complaints unwarranted and misguided, saying they have misunderstood the timber availability analysis from the start.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:38 am It can all be gone in an instant. A single dad of five is trying to pick up the pieces after he and his family lost everything in a fire. “I pulled up right before the fire department arrived. I had a sinking pit in my stomach as soon as I turned down the street because the proximity looked like it was either my house or my neighbor’s house. I knew something was not good,” Lino Lakes resident Maisen Saxton recalled. “The bottom line is I’m thankful that everybody was safe. Not everybody is that fortunate … We are just trying to do best we can to pick up the pieces and keep in good spirits.” When the fire broke out, no one was home. Saxton ran to Walmart to pick up a few last-minute things they needed to host Christmas Eve dinner. His parents, who live across the street, were also helping prepare for the meal. While Maisen was gone, family members were running between the two houses. “They were using the oven to heat up some dishes for dinner … They left thinking there wouldn’t be any issue,” Saxton recalled. “Thirty minutes later, they got a knock on the door from my neighbor saying your house is on fire.” Saxton’s father went over to try to put the fire out, but at that point Saxton said it was too late. “It was an accident, it was tragic, it’s been devastating, but blaming anybody and should’ve, could’ve, would haves aren’t going to do anything,” he said. “If my windshield wiper didn’t break, and I didn’t go back (into WalMart), I may have been home. I’m pretty sure I would have at least seen it and I probably could have put it out. There is nothing I can do about it now. It could have gone differently with a number of different variables, but it didn’t, and we are where we are.” Saxton, originally from Oregon, has lived in Lino Lakes for 2 1/2 years. He purchased the home from his parents. He is now staying right across the street from their damaged home in his parents’ home with his two children, ages 8 and 10, and three foster children, ages 10, 12 and 14. Saxton is a Metro Transit driver. As a single dad of two, he said being a foster parent was not something that was ever on his radar. “I felt like things were plenty difficult enough. I didn’t need any more on my plate,” he said. Long story short, a neighbor a few doors down from them fell on some hard times. The three kids started spending more and more time at Saxton’s house. Child Protective Services eventually got involved, and now Saxton is considered a “kinship foster.” For the foreseeable future, the children will remain with him. The hope is that that their mother will be able to care for them again one day. “It’s been a wild and unexpected ride,” Saxton said. Unexpected support Since Saxton has only been in Minnesota for a couple of years, he was not expecting the outpouring of support he and his family have received since the Christmas Eve tragedy. “In this unforeseen tragedy, we have been really blessed with unexpected support from the local community,” Saxton said. “That has been really cool to see. It’s been a huge help and encouragement to keep my head up.” Robyn and Lindsay Smith know Saxton and his family through sports, as Saxton coached their son’s baseball team. “We know the family and were heartbroken to hear that they lost everything,” Robyn said. “I immediately reached out to Maisen to see what they needed and how we could help … He gave me a list, and I got to work.” The two set out to see what donations they could round up, and ended up finding support through a church congregation and social media. Saxton says he sent a list of items the family could use and next thing he knew, a U-Haul showed up with everything on the list and then some. “I was blown away; other than coaching their son in baseball, I’ve had very minimal contact with them,” he said. “It leaves me dumbfounded and speechless.” Robyn added, “Maisen’s a great dad and a really nice person. He would do anything for his kids. We just wanted to be able to help him however we could. I really hope the community will rally around him and help him in this time of need.” Many people have stepped up to help the family by providing clothes, furniture and even cash donations. As of press deadline, a GoFundMe had raised over $15,000. “The support just made it so much more bearable. I don’t feel the hopelessness and I can fight the urge to break down in tears when I step into the place because I know how much support we have,” he said. “We are going to be okay.” To donate, visit: https://gf.me/v/c/lmgs/fire-of-christmas-eve Managing Editor Shannon Granholm can be reached at 651-407-1227 or quadnews@presspubs.com Log In Keep it Clean.

Lawrence, a long time Baldwin Township resident, farmer, township supervisor, and small business operator, recently announced his campaign for State Representative in Minnesota House District 27B.

Elim Lutheran Church Pastor Seth Perry is no stranger to the challenges that mental health conditions can cause. Worse yet, the prevailing stigma makes it difficult to talk about one’s mental health and receive the help they need. To combat the stigma and make mental health a priority in his community, Perry started a campaign to raise awareness about mental health in February of 2023. Continuing in that pursuit, Elim is hosting a Lenten Mental Health Dinner Feb. 21 to kick off the Our Stigma campaign this year. Perry, originally from Vancouver, British Columbia became a pastor in 2017 and remained a pastor in Canada until 2019 when he moved to Scandia. By August of 2022, he was the pastor at Elim Lutheran Church. Having personal experience with the impact of his own mental health conditions, he made the effort to raise awareness last year at Elim. “Last year, I thought there was a need in a lot of our congregations to have a broader discussion and deeper education about mental health conditions,” said Perry. “People come to church and a lot of them are in a state of need and a lot of that is tied to their own mental health. But I saw that many people didn't feel comfortable talking about their own mental health. “I knew that I was one of those people. I knew the people that were coming to the church either had family members with mental health conditions or they themselves had a mental health condition and they needed to hear some support.” Perry had been diagnosed with Bipolar type 1 in his mid-twenties but had struggled with the condition since he was a teenager. In order to break the stigma of talking about mental health, Perry decided to inform his congregation of his diagnosis last year. “I thought it was time for me to share that openly with the congregation and see how they would respond,” Perry said. “And the response was great. I think it was twofold. A lot of people who have family members that are affected by mental health conditions came to me and needed help and understand their loved ones, but also individuals who were in crisis started to come to the church more and feel comfortable coming to this place and to ask for help. “I didn't expect it to be that successful, but that's what our last year of ministry at Elim Lutheran Church has been focused around was finding help for individuals who are in crisis and allowing family members to be more comfortable asking for help about their loved ones and to realize that they're not alone.” With the overwhelming success of the first campaign last year, Perry has worked with local organizations to continue the progress made toward helping those with mental health struggles. From Feb. 21 through March 20, the Our Stigma campaign will help raise awareness for all those affected by various mental health conditions and the stigma of speaking out about them. “I've been overwhelmed with the amount of people that need help and want to talk about getting help. That really points to a larger societal crisis we're in the midst of right now. I think there's not enough accessibility to care for individuals who are in crisis or who need to see professionals, and that's happening right here in Washington and Chisago counties. “The goal of the campaign is to connect the various community organizations so we can serve the community better… I think that we're providing a forum where we can further the dialogue. And a church is a great intermediary space. We have the physical space, we have a volunteers and we can start helping people make connections in order to better the health of community members here.” The Our Stigma campaign kickoff starts Feb. 21 at the Elim Lutheran Church Lenten Mental Health Dinner. This is a “pay what you can” dinner and no one is turned away. Tickets are for sale in advance at the Elim Lutheran Church Office. Proceeds go to the Scandia Marine Food Shelf. Dinner is served at 5:15 p.m. and a candlelight vigil will be held in the sanctuary at 7 p.m. Then a PTSD Awareness Potluck event will be held March 20 at the Elim Lutheran Church. The dinner starts a 5:15 p.m. and all are invited to bring a dish to share.

Throughout the campaign the National Alliance on Mental Illnesses (NAMI) is teaching an hour and a half long suicide prevention class.

Please give us a call at 218-736-7511 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Mike Frisch with a walleye caught from a weed edge. As a fishing TV host/fishing educator one of my goals is to help people catch more fish. Here is a look at three things that anglers can do this coming season that can help them increase their fishing skills and hopefully catch more fish! Embrace change With the vast increase in water clarity that many of our lakes have seen in the last dozen years or so, successful anglers have recognized this change and, most importantly, adapted to the situation. For example, when chasing walleyes, I find myself fishing more and more in and around weeds, or targeting much deeper waters. It’s my thought that many of today’s walleyes seek the shade and cover that weeds offer. Or they avoid the increased light penetration that clear water creates by heading much deeper. Simply put, back in the day we fished the edges of classic walleye structure like underwater points and sunken humps, often with water that was in the 15–25-foot range. Today, however those fish might be up shallower in the weeds on the tops of that structure or slid out deeper into the basin adjacent to the humps and points. Embracing change regarding fish location is important, but so is learning fishing techniques better suited for where the fish now hold. For example, in the past, walleye anglers relied on Lindy-style rigs and jig/minnow combinations for fishing the structure mentioned above. Those methods will still catch some fish, but weed walleyes are often targeted by the modern walleye angler pitching jigs tipped with plastics or throwing slip bobbers to pockets in the weeds. And a heavy 3- or even 4-ounce bottom bouncer tipped with a plain snell and a nightcrawler is a great way to pursue those fish that have slid out a bit and now are in maybe 40 to 50 feet of water. Be a line watcher I grew up a walleye angler, eventually became a basshead and now consider myself a multi-species angler. One thing bass fishing taught me that helps catch fish of all species is the importance of watching my fishing line, particularly when casting lures. Often, for example, when I pitch a jig/plastic to bass, my line twitches on the bite. Walleye jig pitchers can also see bites. Several falls back, guide clients and I were on a good bite pitching 1/8-ounce jigs and minnows to shallow weeds. Smaller walleyes were just “felt” as the line and rod tip got heavy. Once in a while, however, the fishing line would slowly start to swim off to the side. Those were usually bigger walleyes in the 4- to 8-pound range! If you weren’t paying attention, those fish would drop the jig minus a hookset. To facilitate seeing more bites, I often use hi-vis braided line in combination with a short fluorocarbon leader. The hi vis braid is very sensitive and visible, while the fluoro leader is invisible to the fish. CONTRA Braid in the yellow color is spooled on lots of my rods, allowing my fishing partners and me to see and feel more bites and set more hooks. Fish more Learning about fish behavior, various technologies and fishing techniques is important to upping your fishing game. However, nothing beats time on the water! It’s no coincidence that the best anglers I know are also those who spend the most time on the water. The age-old saying “practice makes perfect” holds true to fishing. While perfection probably won’t happen in the fishing world, anglers can often up their game by spending more time on the water, and by putting to use some of the tips presented above regarding embracing change and line watching too. As always, good luck on the water and remember to include a youngster in your next outdoors adventure! Mike Frisch is the host of the popular Fishing the Midwest TV series.

The Disabled American Veterans (DAV) Chapter 25 donated $10,000 to support the new construction of a Memorial Wall adjacent to the existing wall. The current Memorial Wall, also known as The Walk of Honor was constructed in 2004 after the March 1998 opening of the Home. The Wall lists each of the 854 Residents who have passed away while living in the Home. The existing Wall has just enough space for one last engraving in early-May for those Residents who have passed during the previous 12 months. The Walk of Honor is one way the Veterans Home honors and remembers each person listed so family and friends can gather to pay their respects and reflect on the sacrifices made by those who served our country. The Fergus Falls DAV uses the funds collected from clothes deposited in the large lime-green bins scattered around the community “to give back to fellow Veterans in need and other community projects.” “The Veterans Home is proud to accept this gift on behalf of our 78 Residents and future Residents, who gave unselfishly and made sacrifices to protect our great nation. This new wall will represent the names of approximately 1,000 Residents over the next 25 years. We are thankful for the thoughtful generosity of those military members who do great work for our Disabled American Veterans,” said Gary Harris Jr., public affairs official at the Fergus Falls Veterans Home, in a news release.

injured after an explosion Monday rippled through the bottom floors of a hotel building in downtown Fort Worth, Texas, authorities said. One person was in critical condition and four others were seriously injured, MedStar spokesperson Matt Zavadsky said at a news briefing Monday. The rest had minor injuries. Craig Trojacek, a spokesperson for the Fort Worth Fire Department, said the first call of a fire at Sandman Signature Fort Worth Downtown Hotel was received at around 3:32 p.m. local time. Multiple calls about an explosion came in after. The smell of gas permeated through downtown Fort Worth, Trojacek later said, adding that investigators are confident the blast was ""some kind of gas explosion."" Photos of the explosion showed windows and debris blown out and scattered across the street. The fire department said Monday evening the blast no longer posed any public safety issues to downtown Fort Worth, but crews would be on the scene all night to continue search efforts and ensure no one was trapped. Desiree Partain of MedStar, which provides ambulance and emergency medical services in Fort Worth, said medics treated four people on the scene but did not take them to a hospital. According to Trojacek, investigators are working with federal investigators to determine the cause of the blast. The scene, Trojacek added, had left rescue teams unable to immediately reach some parts of the building. ""We had reports of people trapped down in the basement, and because of the explosion that took place, some of those access areas were either covered up or it didn’t feel safe at that point to get people down into,"" Trojacek said. Developing into the night: For an update, sign up for USA TODAY\'s Evening Briefing newsletter Mike Vanca was staying at the hotel but was not inside when the explosion happened. He was in a nearby office and still felt the shockwave from the explosion. ""The building shook like someone slapped the side of it with your hand,"" Vanca told KDFW. ""So it was very loud and very violent."" Hunter Chacon, an employee at nearby Wicked Butcher, told the Dallas Morning News that he arrived to downtown shortly after the blast as first responders were still pouring in. He ran toward the commotion before he was stopped about three blocks from the hotel. “From there, I could definitely smell the gas,” Chacon said. The 245-room Sandman Signature Fort Worth Downtown Hotel dates to 1920, according to the hotel’s website, and is located in a busy area of downtown about one block from the Fort Worth Convention Center. The building, known as “The Waggoner Building,” has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1979. Sandman Hotel in Fort Worth said Monday that due to damage from the blast, it won\'t be taking bookings “until further notice.” The hotel did not immediately return USA TODAY’s request for comment. Trojacek said a restaurant in the building had been under construction but said it was not definitive that is where the blast occurred. Kristin Goodspeed, a spokesperson for natural gas provider Atmos Energy, told USA TODAY that technicians were on the scene at the request of the city’s fire department. ""Gas has been isolated to the affected area, and we will continue to assist the Fort Worth Fire and Police Departments and all officials in support of their investigation,"" Goodspeed said. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he had been in contact with local officials following the blast and was ready to ""immediately deploy any additional personnel and resources needed to keep Texans in the area safe and out of harm’s way.""

Gudmundson, without hearing anything about what his Republican Party actually stands for. It used to be fiscal conservatism, a strong military, a well-kept infrastructure. But according to Gudmundson, its really about anti-women’s rights, anti-LGBTQ, anti-immigrant, anti-Native American, pro-fossil fuels, pro-guns, pro-unrestrained police powers, anti-schools, anti-peoples right to choose as their recreational drug one which is far less dangerous and lethal than alcohol and tobacco, and anti-state spending on the people’s priorities. Not to mention, the Republican Party is the victim of the self-serving actions and words of the criminal Donald Trump. No sane person will vote to put him back in office, and everyone riding on his coattails deserves to lose their offices and positions, as well. Remember the letter I wrote you a while back, requesting that only positive and reasoned statements be accepted for publication? It’s the election year now.

eight and then two as the top choices to create a Baxter dog park. The No. 1 choice is city-owned land near the intersection of Clearwater and Inglewood Drive for its low cost, accessibility, soil and topography, screening and proximity to high density housing. The property covers 27.2 acres, much of it wooded with a wetland on one side. In addition to the park itself, the property has the potential to provide walking trails for leashed dogs, an area for parking and an option to have a dedicated site for smaller dogs. “So we really thought this had a lot of opportunity for the future, very close to a lot of high density, to residential that people can walk from,” said Consultant Jillian Reiner, Widseth landscape architect who presented the options. “It’s connected to trails on the same side of the street.” Reiner said there is a large benefit to having a dog park in a wooded area because of the shade, which is an important factor. She said shade is the number one ask for a dog park. The second choice property is the city’s North Water Tower property at the intersection of Woida Road and Inglewood Drive. The area is largely open with screening on the perimeter of the 3.2 acres. It is also close to high density housing, is low cost, accessible and meets the other metrics for distance from a residence. Reiner noted there aren’t many ways the site can be used. One thing that could increase the cost may be the need to move the entrance farther away from the busier street intersection. ADVERTISEMENT “We wanted to be close to some trails and we wanted people to be able to walk,” Reiner said, noting national studies they reviewed noted people who use dog parks really like to be able to walk their dog there. The distance goal was a quarter-mile to a half-mile from their apartment. The idea of being closer to higher density housing was to give dog owners who don’t have much greenspace, a place to go and utilize the benefits of a dog park. Reiner said it’s possible some of the city owned parcels that weren’t on the top of the list this time could work at a later date for another dog park as the city grows. Other city-owned locations on the short list included an 11.4 acre site on Oakwood Drive, a 2.4 acres property on Hastings Road, a 1.2 acre site by Clearwater Road and Forest Drive, a 4.6 acre site by Southdale Park and a 17.7 acre site called Whipple Woods by Whipple Beach, and a 1.5 acre site by Hinckley Road. Council member Jeff Phillips wondered if there would be a requirement for people who used the park to license their dogs through the city. Reiner said that isn’t typical and would be challenging to manage. She noted people who travel also look for dog parks. Council member Zach Tabatt said he’d like a full analysis of whether the currently vacant land just to the south of Clearwater Road would be developed, perhaps with another apartment building going up there. In that case, since the parcel is large, Tabatt wondered if there was a different access point for a parking lot to that site for a dog park there. Council member Connie Lyscio has been a longstanding advocate of adding a dog park in the city. Priorities in scoring for potential parcels The study noted future sites that may work for a potential future dog park as the city grows. It determined a single 1.5 acre dog park would accommodate the estimated 9,400 residents of Baxter (based on the 2021 Census) that is growing at 2.2% annually along with 85,250 people in the greater Brainerd Micropolitan Area (which includes Crow Wing and Cass counties) and about 76,000 people visiting or driving through Baxter regularly, especially during the summer.

That open house is from 6-8 p.m. Feb. 29 at City Hall. The city’s goal is to construct the dog park this year.

To say that Cooper’s Foods is an institution in the Chaska community is an understatement. Opened more than 100 years ago in 1917 by current owner Gary Cooper’s grandparents, Joe and Rose, the store has weathered good times and bad expanding to a chain of, at its peak, seven stores across the Midwest. Cooper’s Chaska location is set to close in less than a month, leaving the St. Paul store as the only remaining family operation. Large national chains have moved into the community over the past decade, making it progressively more difficult to compete. Since the start of the Highway 41 construction project, according to Cooper, sales dropped 10%. “Frankly, I think Chaska is losing something,” says Cooper of the pending store closure. Cooper’s started not as a grocery store, but as a “cash store” buying and selling goods, including groceries. As reported in this newspaper in 1917: “J. Cooper and family moved into the Mrs. Schmidt residence in the first ward last week. Mr. Cooper is a junk dealer and expects to engage entirely in that business.” Joe Cooper turned the store over to his son and daughter-in-law, Jake and Lillian, in 1942. Again from the Chaska Herald of that year, “Jake and Lillian Cooper, new owners of the popular Cooper’s store in Chaska have, in a scant six weeks, transformed the old stand, so ablely managed through the years by Mr. and Mrs. Joe Cooper, into a supermarket in all that the word implies.” It was under his parent’s ownership, Gary Cooper began working at the store at age 11. The store was expanded several times in the following decades, with other stores opened by the Coopers in Jonathan and Plymouth. In 1977, still under Jake and Lillian’s ownership, the store relocated from downtown Chaska, to Walnut Street where it remains to this day. Over the years, competition from big box stores like Target, Rainbow Foods, Aldi, and Cub has increased. In 1996 Rainbow Foods moved in at the intersection of Highway 41 and Pioneer Trail, beating out a potential expansion for Cooper’s. With Costco set to open a within a few miles from the Chaska store later this year, another competitor “is not a threat, it’s a reality,” says Cooper. Cooper has previously called big box stores “predatory” in how they can cut prices that are difficult to match by smaller stores, and in the end, may eventually be driven out of business. Some larger national chains sell milk for cheaper than his cost, says Cooper, citing a Minnesota law that puts a floor on the price of milk in the state for all but during the month of June. “I don’t know how they can do that,” says Cooper. Cooper met with city officials on Jan. 29 in order to work out a deal to keep the doors of his grocery store open. The option discussed would have designated the land around Cooper’s Chaska location to be sold to a land trust and leased back to Cooper’s for a minimum price. This arrangement has been used by the city previously, but only to create affordable housing. “We haven’t ever proposed that for a commercial property, but we thought it was important,” said City Administrator Matt Podhradsky. While the proposal would have theoretically lowered operating costs for Cooper’s, funds would be needed to set up the land trust and renovations to the store would be required in order to meet state laws. Cooper said the plan was “reasonable and made sense, but based on the sales trends I’ve seen and the money I’ve been losing, I decided to not continue.” While this decision marks the end of not just an era, but of several, Cooper is glad to have come to a decision. “I have less anxiety today than when I was deciding,” he concluded. With less than a month left in business, Cooper’s new focus is on selling their remaining product stock. Discounts of 25% can already be found on store shelves. Price cuts will increase as the store moves towards its final days, he said. “One way the community can help and one of the things we need is to turn that inventory into cash,” says Cooper. Part of his focus is on “making employees whole,” says Cooper, citing the funds will be needed to pay out employees for earned sick days and PTO. Though the store’s time in Chaska is coming to an end, Cooper is grateful for the ride. “Even though I don’t like the ending, it was a good story,” says Cooper. Cooper’s Food will be open until March 2 and is located at 710 Walnut St. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular articles.

editorialroundup More jobs. More people. Minnesota’s employment and population trends are going in the right direction, which should create cautious optimism going into 2024. The data, derived from recent reports from the Department of Employment and Economic Development ( DEED ) as well as the U.S. Census Bureau, show stable, steady growth in both areas. In a credit to the state’s employers and workers, Minnesota has added jobs for five months straight and 9,500 more from October to November. That’s the largest increase since January. And the state gained 17,300 jobs over a three-month period, a 0.6% increase, compared with a 0.2% increase in the same time frame nationally. November’s state unemployment rate fell to 3.1%, impressively below the 3.7% national rate, as eight of 10 “supersectors” (as DEED deems them) saw growth, including trade, transportation and utilities (up 3,300 jobs); education and health services (up 2,700); government (up 1,100), and manufacturing (up 1,000). But reflecting an enduring challenge to Minnesota employers and the state itself, the labor force actually decreased by 7,433 people in November, dropping Minnesota’s participation rate to 68.3%. That’s still well above the 62.8% national average, but below what’s needed for most employers facing chronic labor shortages — a particularly acute condition in southern Minnesota, Angelina Nguyen, DEED labor market information director, said during a virtual news conference last Thursday. DEED will continue to roll out workforce development initiatives in 2024, Commissioner Matt Varilek said during the news conference, in which he also commented on the positive population growth of 23,615 people from July 2022 to July 2023. While the 0.4% increase isn’t as high as some rapidly growing Sun Belt states — as well as neighboring North and South Dakota — it’s better than the previous two years, and more in line with Minnesota’s typical trend line. Some of the increase came from post-pandemic stabilization of natural growth (births minus deaths), which accounted for 13,834 more Minnesotans, and even more from international migration, which added 14,575 new Minnesotans. But domestic out-migration — Minnesotans moving to other states — continued, albeit at a slower pace of 4,686. The overall population growth “is a positive thing for all those employers that have more demand for workers than they can find,” Varilek said. “Beyond that, I would say we hope to continue supporting that trend and inviting Minnesotans by being a welcoming place.” It already is for jobseekers — and government, institutions and individuals can make it even more welcoming. But it’s crucial that state leaders focus on retaining residents and attracting people from other states. International migration is highly dependent on domestic politics, and an incoming Republican presidential administration (especially under former President Donald Trump) may have much more restrictive immigration policies than the Biden administration has had. State government, under DFL leadership at the executive and legislative level, took several steps last session to try to differentiate Minnesota from neighboring states, including with programs like paid family leave. Next session, legislative leaders, as well as Gov. Tim Walz, should proceed with caution, however, because of impending budget restraints as well the need to adjust to the significant investments made last session, many of which will also require new workers to implement. “I think we should all take pride in the unique strengths of the Minnesota economy,” Varilek said, commenting on its structural diversity, high prosperity, high incomes and relatively low unemployment. Within the Upper Midwest, Minnesota “has really taken a distinct, strategic approach to policy,” he added as he reflected on initiatives in education and other sectors. “We think those things are going to give us an advantage as people learn more about the Minnesota story, and learn more about the Minnesota quality of life.” It’s a story that should indeed be heard regionally, nationally and internationally.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:17 am The economy is showing good signs for consumers. Jobs are readily available to most, inflation is down to a mostly normal 3%, and people are traveling more. But there’s one aspect that is going to cause some consumer pain for the next couple of months — flying. Thanks to the blown-out door plug on the Alaska Airlines flight, all 737 Max 9 (a new variant of the 737 Max 8 that was grounded after two crashes back in 2018) planes in the U.S. have been grounded. That is 171 planes across carriers United and Alaska, the only airlines currently flying the plane in the U.S. We’re still waiting on the FAA investigation to determine the actual cause of the failure and until then flights are going to be a bit more expensive for us. With 171 planes across United and Alaska airlines that cannot fly right now, those routes have to be accommodated with other planes. As you can imagine, airlines don’t just keep spare planes around. So both United and Alaska are going to have to change where they have each of their planes and what routes those planes are on to try to accommodate passengers who would normally be on the grounded planes. All of that means fewer flights for us to take. Many people who would normally fly Alaska or United will now have to fly a different airline. This means rising costs for the rest of us. So let’s talk about what went wrong and why this is Boeing’s fault (again?). Boeing manufactures the 737 with enough doors to accommodate emergency exits for the maximum number of passengers. If an airline wants to cram their passengers in as tightly as possible all of the emergency exit doors are needed. But some airlines, like Alaska, don’t treat their passengers like sardines and give us more room. Because there are fewer passengers on the plane, fewer emergency exits are needed. The exits that aren’t needed are plugged with what’s called a door plug. From the inside of the plane you wouldn’t know the difference, it looks just like the rest of the plane. There’s a good chance many of us have flown right next to a door plug and didn’t know it. The door plug is tested several times throughout manufacturing the plane, including pressurization tests to ensure the plane can remain pressurized while in flight. On this particular plane the pressurization warning light came on during a couple of the previous flights. While that does seem to speak to lax maintenance on the part of Alaska, I’ve read that this warning light is much like the check engine light on our cars. There could be any number of reasons it came on including the sensor being faulty. Instead of playing the blame game, Boeing admitted fault in this case. It’s possible that there was an issue during the manufacture of the plane, or the fix could just be doing extra maintenance on the door plugs to ensure they are secure.

Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:21 am Now, more than ever, the world needs trustworthy reporting—but good journalism isn’t free. Please support us by subscribing or making a contribution. “Readers Digest” is a 100-year-old publication with a global circulation of more than 10.5 million readers. “Good Morning America” is the number one nationally televised morning news show in the United States. Closer to home, Boyd Huppert’s “Land of 10,000 Stories” on KARE-11 is the recipient of numerous awards in news writing and photojournalism. And Jonathan Werner — celebrated for selling more popcorn than any Boy Scout in Minnesota and spending his earnings on presents for foster children — has been featured in all three. But make no mistake: When the 13-year-old Mora boy set out on his quest to buy Christmas gifts for needy children, publicity was the last thing on his mind. “I didn’t really want the news attention, but I decided to do it because I thought it would have a good impact on scouting and reflect a good image on my council (Troop 506 of Ham Lake) and on scouting as a whole,” the incredibly articulate teenager said. Jonathan’s story goes like this: In 2020, he set a goal to sell $10,000 worth of popcorn, “just to push myself, and because I also wanted a Lego set as a prize for being number one in my council. So I thought, the next year, why not try to be number one?” The next year, he heard his father Steven Kolk talking about the sparse Christmases he experienced as a child in foster care, which prompted Jonathan to become a philanthropist. He sold more than $46,000 worth of popcorn, earning enough in rewards — around $5,000 — to buy presents for foster kids in Kanabec and Isanti Counties. Surprise fame It was 2022 that brought him the most notoriety. Jonathan sold $56,396 worth of popcorn — the most of any Scout in Minnesota and among the top three in the United States. He used $11,300 in rewards to purchase Christmas gifts for needy children in Kanabec, Isanti, Pine, Chisago and northern Anoka Counties. “We had boxes and boxes of presents from floor to ceiling,” his mother Serena Kolk noted. “My son Steven’s room — because he had the most open floor space — that’s where we stored the presents. It was just filled. He had just a path.” Last year was an off year due to a slow economy. He seems almost ashamed when he admits he sold only $51,000 worth of popcorn, but perks up when he notes that he was able to purchase $12,000 in gifts for kids in Kanabec, Isanti, Pine, Chisago Counties, and he added children from the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe to his roster. Just buying that many gifts — often more than 600 — is a task unto itself. When he decided to start this project, he first had to figure out how to find the foster kids, so he made a phone call to Kanabec County. Once he made that first call, he was able to be directed to the proper office where he obtained the wish lists of children. Once he knew the appropriate office to reach out to, making calls to other counties came easy to him. He has never met any of the children he has purchased gifts for, which he understands because of privacy issues, although he has received thank yous. “I’ve gotten four or five private notes. A couple of them even drew pictures,” he said. Up next The popcorn-selling season starts the third week of September. Typically, Jonathan sets an overall sales goal for the year, and then breaks it down into weekly sales goals and then daily goals. Since he is home-schooled, he starts his schooling in early August, so he can use most of October to sell popcorn. His mother points out, however, that, unlike public school students, Jonathan and his younger brother, Steven, and sister, Georgina, don’t get the same breaks for holidays, so they manage to get all of their schoolwork completed when other kids have days off. Serena is the Cub Scout leader for Steven and Georgina’s troop in Isanti, where Jonathan serves as a den chief, a type of youth leader who helps with the Cub Scouts. He’s also in National Youth Leadership training as a staff member, so he’s teaching others. He attends monthly staff development and a week-long course at Fred C. Andersen Scout Camp in Wisconsin. He is also a member of the Order of the Arrow, the National Honor Society for scouting, for which he is a constellation chief. Soon, he hopes to join the Civil Air Patrol Cadets. Goals he has in scouting include becoming an Eagle Scout; earning all of the merit badges offered and as many of the extra awards as he possibly can; and finally seeing his fund-raising and gift-buying project go statewide. “I’m going to work with my Boy Scout Council to get a non-profit started to get this project off the ground,” he said. For his Eagle Scout project, he hopes to do something that would benefit veterans, since he has many veterans and military personnel in his life. When his great-grandfather was still alive, Jonathan often visited the veteran’s home in St. Cloud and entertained the residents by playing his violin. Because of his interest in working with veterans, attending ceremonies, dropping off popcorn for their events, and visiting them at the veterans home and bringing them thank you cards, in January, Jonathan was awarded the National American Legion Auxiliary Youth Good Deed Award at a ceremony in Pine City. He was nominated for the award by Linda Setterlund, who saw his donation bucket was focused on soldiers and veterans. “When she heard about what I do, she decided I was worthy of this award,” he said. Long-term During COVID, Jonathan had to stop his veterans home visits, but he hopes to begin again, if he can find the time. As a scout, he also does flag placement and wreath clean-up at cemeteries. On Saturday, Feb. 3, he was at Fort Snelling, helping with gathering the hundreds of Christmas wreaths for disposal. So enamored of the military is he that he hopes to attend either the United States Air Force Academy or the United States Naval Academy when he graduates from high school, with his eye on being part of the Judge Advocate Corps. But that’s all in the future. After all, he’s only 13, something that’s easy to forget in conversation with him. Right now, his aim is to stick with the popcorn-selling project for next year and keep buying gifts for foster kids. “That not only helps me and the foster kids, it helps my troop, my council, and the Boy Scouts at the national level to operate their different programs,” he said.

The event included the unveiling of the auditoriums new seating. NEW ULM — Where is the best seat in town? After two months of renovations, it’s at State Street Theater. The historic theater began replacing its old wooden seating with new modern seats. As of this week, the auditorium has a total of 703 new, comfortable chairs as well as additional ADA-compliant seating. A special unveiling ceremony was held for the renovated auditorium, which included a brief program on the history of the theater. Historian Dr. Dan Groebner, who has researched the theater for years described the renovations as “breathtaking.” Groebner explained the theater was originally built in 1939 as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project. The theater was originally part of New Ulm High School, serving as auditorium/gym space. The building eventually transitioned into Middle School. It was for this reason the theater was originally built with narrow wooden seating. By 2012, the school district was no longer using the building as a school and was looking to sell it. Eventually, it was sold to a local citizen group called Cenate LLC. Cenate’s purpose was to find a solution to housing shortages and turn ownership of the gym/auditorium over to a performing arts group. The renovation of State Street Theaters auditorium was completed this week. Among the renovations was the replacement of the old narrow wooden seats with wider cushioned seats. After the sale of the classroom side of the building, Cenate gave the theater space over to New Ulm Actors Community Theatre, which officially changed its name to State Street Theater Company (SSTC). Over the years, State Street Theater has raised over $1 million through capital campaigns. The early campaigns were designed to update infrastructure, with the most recent campaign to improve the aesthetics of the space. SSTC President Emeritus Mary Ellen Domeier said it was the current campaign that covered the cost of replacing the seating. The aim was to keep the auditorium in the style of a 1939 theater, but have more modern seating. The old wooden seats are the most frequent complaint from audiences. Domeier explained the old wooden seats were only 17 inches wide. The new seats are between 20 and 22 inches wide. In addition, to the seats safety railings were added to the steep balcony. Aisle lights were added to all parts of the theater. Several donors and volunteers were thanked for making the renovations possible. Mikelson Medica Foundation and the Roger & Carol Ryberg Family Trust each donated over $100,000 to the project. Seating improvements at State Street included safety upgrades to the balcony. New railings were installed along the stairs. “It is not often we can have an effect on the quality of life in a community and we have here,” Roger Ryberg said. He believed the arts were needed to give a community a high-quality life and these renovations were a part of making that possible. “I look forward to enjoying these 22-inch seats,” Ryberg said. Thor Mickelson said it was amazing to be part of a community that cares so much to make the theater renovations possible. He credited strong leadership and many volunteers for making this project possible. SSTC’s board of directors also wished to thank four of the earliest volunteers for getting the theater company started and continuing to thrive.

The program closed with a special proclamation, read by New Ulm City Council President Andrea Boettger, declaring Feb. 9, 2024, State Street Theater Day.

are going to the Chanhassen Dinner Theater to see the musical “Beautiful: The Carole King Story.” The soundtrack of a generation inspired this Broadway smash hit! For nearly six years, “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” thrilled Broadway audiences with the inspiring true story of Carole King’s remarkable journey from teenage songwriter to Rock & Roll Hall of Fame music legend. As a woman in the music industry, King broke barriers and became one of the most prolific songwriters of our time! King and her writing partner, Gerry Goffin, wrote over 20 songs that became chart hits. Many different artists recorded her songs in the 1960s. In 1971 she wrote and recorded the Grammy-winning masterpiece album, “Tapestry.” It was at the top of the U.S. album chart for 15 weeks. It is one of the best-selling albums of all time. King made 25 solo albums. Her most recent album is “Live at the Troubadour”, which she made with James Taylor. This album was No. 4 on the charts in its first week and has sold over 400,000 copies. She has won four Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for her songwriting. In 2009, Carole King was admitted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. Carole wrote hits for the biggest music acts from The Shirelles to The Righteous Brothers. The musical takes you on a joy-filled, emotional ride of a lifetime! Featuring over two dozen hits including “One Fine Day,” “The Locomotion,” “So Far Away,” “Natural Woman,” “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin,’” and “Will You Love Me Tomorrow,” this Tony and Grammy Award-winning musical is filled with the songs you remember and a story you’ll never forget. A huge cast of singers and dancers bring more than 24 of her greatest hits to life in a triumphant celebration! Call the Senior Center, 507-263-2136, to make your reservation for the matinee show on Saturday, March 15. The cost is $125 for CVSC members and $135 for non-members. The price includes transportation, dinner and gratuity. Join us and leave the driving to us! If you haven’t signed up for a CVSC membership, now would be a good time to save $10 on your trip for a $20 membership for the year. Plus, you’ll receive discounts from local businesses and other benefits at CVSC programs and events. We’re hosting an open house! Join us Tuesday, Feb. 13, from 1-3 p.m. at the CVSC. We’ll be serving treats and refreshments. Come in and learn more about our programs and events. John Lyons from Landmark Tours will speak at 2 p.m. about traveling with their company, which also benefits the CVSC when you travel with them. This event is free and open to the public. Feeling a little crafty? We’ll be making 3-D paper heart decorations and painting rocks that we’ll place around town on Monday, Feb. 12, at 11 a.m. These are easy and fun to create! Members are free of charge, non-members $5. Join us for “It’s Coffee Time!” at 10 a.m. and fire up for some crafting fun afterwards! Who to help? How to help? These questions will be covered by Shannon Bauer, the “Needs Assessor” of the Good Samaritan Fund helping people in need in the Cannon Falls area at the Wednesday, Feb. 14 meeting of the Cannon Falls Area Triad - Citizens and Law Enforcement Partnership at 10 a.m. at the Cannon Valley Senior Center, 120 State Street West, Cannon Falls. Bauer explained that his master’s degree in Family Systems Theory has been helpful in this project. “In vetting those seeking Good Samaritan funds - spirit-led discernment is very important. In getting to know those in need,sometimes it is about recognizing unhealthy patterns over blindly giving funds. Helping people with the resources to seek a healthy lifestyle is a joy in this ministry,” said Bauer. “Also taking the time to listen and discern helps to weed out the scammers. Unfortunately, close to half of the Good Samaritan requests come from a scam. I look forward to sharing a few of these stories of help and God’s wisdom with you on Feb. 14.” Other topics of interest at the meeting include dialogue with local Cannon Falls Police Officers and Goodhue County Deputies. Hope to see you there! It seems there are lots of smiles when it comes to this record-breaking mild weather we’re experiencing lately. As someone that does enjoy the snow and the beauty of winter, I’m really enjoying the ease of living in this! Although, I have also had concerns over what these warm temps are doing to our plants. Looking into this, I found some relief from learning from the Minnesota Arboretum, that plants don’t respond to temperature only, but through daylight hours of sun. Some buds you might see might have developed in the fall and is not unusual. Mulching a little extra around perennials will help with temperature differences if the cold does come around to get us. Also, keeping track of trees and plants that get through these extremes are good to note if you plan on new plantings on your property. I’ve been surprised to see my parsley and thyme getting green! Unfortunately, this warm winter could mean ecological ripple effects on Minnesota forests, and wildlife according to the Minnesota DNR. Climate change is happening and is a study on its own. We’re also experiencing a strong El Nino, a warming of the ocean surface, or above-average sea surface temperatures, in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, that is affecting our weather. I’ve heard from maple syrup-making enthusiasts that they’re worried about sap running early and some have reported that the Goldfinches are starting to turn to their summer plumage. My hope is that we adapt as best that we can to our changing environment. In the meantime, enjoy this great weather! Put away your cross country skis and get your bicycle out. The Cannon Valley Trail has been cleared of winter debris and ready for you to roll! Do be aware of possible black ice.

She was connecting twice a week with an advocate there to build stability back into her life after an accident that left her with brain damage, which led to the loss of her job, which ultimately led to being unhoused. Publisher Mikki Morrissette It has been seven years since I talked to her, but something I remember to this day is that she told me one of the items on her wish list was to be able to afford to wear new undergarments again, instead of hand-me-downs. As someone who has generally been steadily housed and employed, this detail about dignity is something I had never considered. It struck me how much I did not know about what Julie, and others impacted by the kinds of challenges she faced, had to navigate. Julie told me that the advocate she worked with helped her feel someone cared and wanted to see her succeed. She rediscovered that she mattered. “I lost that for a while,” she said. “Not knowing where to turn is humiliating. I became simply another number. One of those people who needs help instead of a person.” Two years ago, I met April Chouinard, who appreciated having a place in Saint Peter to recover from substance use. She told me she was supported by her peers at Solace after she relapsed. “To be able to stay gave me a huge sense that I am worth something — that even if I cannot love myself yet, they do,” Chouinard said. “All of a sudden you feel like somebody has your back and you matter. You are not just an addict. That grace is huge.” More recently, I visited Peace House, where unhoused people arrive for an afternoon lunch, conversation about a question of the day, and sometimes a massage, haircut, or bike repair. The house was opened in 1985 by Sister Rose Tillemans with a mission to provide a welcoming space for people who tend to otherwise not be invited over for dinner. She wanted to offer an opportunity to share conversation for “those who had no one to listen to them.” Thanks to 2023 bipartisan legislative work, Minnesota currently has historic financial and policy support to help solve long-simmering underinvestment in housing.

The winter weather of 2023-24 has been an oddity in every sense of the word. The Twin Cities area has barely seen any snow, and record-breaking warm temperatures have continued from December, when on Christmas day the high was 54 degrees Fahrenheit, through to January during which city parks were flooded only to melt a week later to 40 degree temperatures. This warm trend shows no signs of slowing down into February. So what does this mean? What can be taken away from this strange green winter, and how should we think about it? Is it a harbinger of climate change or a particularly egregious example of a strong El Niño? First and foremost, Kenneth Blumenfeld, Senior Climatologist at the Department of Natural Resources, rejects the premise. “It’s always going to be more complicated than people want it to be, and we have to be humble in how we go about answering that.” says Blumenfeld, adding that climate is notoriously hard to both perceive and understand and is far more complicated than we might give it credit for. A key distinction Blumenfeld makes here is the difference between climate and weather. Climate is the totality of weather patterns and conditions over an extended period of time. Weather is what you see looking out your window. The weather this winter has been warm and dry, while the climate for our winters is still quite cold and wet. So when it comes to analyzing this winter, one’s assumption might be that it comes on the coattails of one of the snowiest winters on record and so it balances out. That isn’t the case. According to Blumenfeld, one needs data rather than personal experience to best access and understand climate and the changes to it. Minnesota has weather records dating back to about 200 years to the 1820s. Given that scope of data, one can create a better context with which to understand our current winter. “When we use everything we have, this winter appears to be competing with only one other winter in that period.” says Blumenfeld. The winter in question is the winter of 1877-1878. There are records of dirt roads not being frozen during that winter, making travel extremely difficult. According to Blumenfeld, that winter also arrived with El Niño which explains the similarly warm temperatures. Even this, however, isn’t a definitive answer. The El Niño during the winter of 1877-1878 is considered to be in the 99th percentile for severity. It is the strongest El Niño effect we have on record in Minnesota. This winter we are experiencing a strong El Niño in around the 90th percentile. Despite that nearly 10 point difference, the winters are competing for the warmest temperatures. So what makes up that difference? Climate change, says Blumenfeld. “Sometimes people think climate change is a switch: it’s on or it’s off,” Blumenfeld said. One might easily assume that this winter is anomalous, while last winter was more normal; climate change is on currently, but it was off last winter. That is a fallacy. Pollution and therefore climate change is constant. “These forces are not episodic,” says Blumenfeld. “Its fingerprints were all over last winter.” For example, the stories of trees being crushed under the heavy snowfall last winter is a key indicator of increased moisture in the atmosphere due to climate change. “That was actually a very strong signal of a changing climate,” says Blumenfeld. So yes, this warm winter has been affected both by a particularly strong El Niño, as well as the increased moisture and higher temperatures due to climate change. But is this the new norm? Again, the answer is not a simple one. “Even as the climate changes more, we will still have cold winters,” says Blumenfeld. Though this winter is extremely unusual, “in the years and decades ahead, it will be easier for this to happen,” says Blumenfeld, even if it is unusual for an average winter. In the specific context of Minnesota, what does a wetter, warmer climate mean? For farmers, this changing climate means a longer growing season. An issue Jarrod Schoenecker, President of the Twin Cities Meteorological Society points out has to do with the later initial frosts. “When it gets that cold, the moisture comes out of the atmosphere and out of the things that sit in the atmosphere and that comes out of crops,” Schoenecker said. As winter freezes push later into the year, the moisture isn’t pulled from the atmosphere, crops don’t stay dry and are at greater risk of growing mold in the field which can seriously affect grain quality and harvests. Schoenecker also brings up how a warmer climate can disrupt animals native to Minnesota. Water temperatures affect when fish spawn. Warmer temperatures mean different species of fish begin their reproduction at different times which can lead to a host of issues. Similarly, warm temperatures can affect or outright disrupt animal’s hibernation. Schoenecker said this winter has been highly unusual, affected both by natural warming forces from El Niño as well as man-made climate change. While it is not normal, but might become less unusual if Minnesota’s climate continues to become warmer and wetter. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular articles.

The Flaters have taken on a new adventure in their lives opening the St. Croix Valley Hobby Farm in December 2023. Pictured left to right are Andrew Flater, Mylah Flater, Ava Flater, Brynn Flater, and Rebecca Flater. Spending weeks at a time away from home for work was difficult enough for Osceola resident Andy Flater. But when a fire destroyed his home while hundreds of miles away, a new life was set in motion for him and his family. Starting the St. Croix Valley Hobby Farm in the wake of devastation, Flater found a new path; one that kept him closer to his wife and kids, and one they hope will bring joy to the St. Croix Valley area. Flater lives in Osceola with his wife Becca, and three daughters: Mylah, Ava, and Brynn. Prior to starting this new venture, Flater worked in the oil and gas industry, traveling across the country, and spending weeks away from his family. Even when things were going well, the time spent away continued to weigh heavily on him. “I was always homesick,” Flater said. “It was tough. I was looking for ways to get out and try to figure out what I could do to make it for a family of five.” As he continued to think of what else he could do for a living, Flater continued to take his long work trips out of state. It was during one of those trips in May of 2022 that he nearly lost everything. “I was in West Virginia,” Flater recalled. “I'd go there for 50 days straight, and I'd come home for maybe seven days. But you had to travel on your days off too, so you really only get five days at home. I was on day 42, and I had put my notice in with that company to go back to another company I had previously contracted with that works more of two weeks on, two weeks off schedule. I told them I'd commit to that 50 days that I already committed to and finish this one out. “It was about a 20-minute ride back to the hotel where I stayed and I called my wife and said, ‘I'm going to take a shower and I'll call you back.’ I started getting all kinds of glass breaking on our alarm system and I just thought it was on the fritz again, but it seemed a little more unusual than normal. All of the sudden my wife was calling. I answered and said, ‘What are you calling for? I just talked to you.’ “She was hysterical, screaming and crying. And I could hear sirens. It was terrifying and it still is. I get goosebumps thinking about it. I just cared about where the kids were. I was yelling, ‘Where are the kids?’ And she couldn't really speak… I thought the worst. It was probably only 10, 15 seconds, but it felt like an eternity. I was finally just screaming, ‘Just tell me! Just tell me where they're at!’ Finally, she got it out and said they were at the neighbors. That was a huge relief from my chest.” A lit candle in the basement of Flater’s home had been determined to be the source of the fire. Thankfully, his wife and kids were unharmed, but their home was destroyed. After a long, ongoing struggle with their insurance, they decided they had to move on. In that time, Flater did some soul searching and found inspiration in an unlikely place. “We were at Light up Osceola and Little Blue’s Traveling Zoo is there every year,” Flater said. “My oldest two and my wife are at the Cascade Nutrition’s hot chocolate van and my little one and I are over by the animal pen. She's inside petting the animals, and I'm laying up against the gate. I talked to Ron Dabill, the owner, and he was telling me about his business.” Flater’s conversation with Dabill would spark something in him that would eventually lead to the opening of the St. Croix Valley Hobby Farm, but not before he returned to work like before. Later that year after being dropped off by his wife at the airport for another work trip, Flater boarded a plane again. But this time, he knew he had reached a tipping point. “I hear them talking about closing the door and something just shoots through me,” he said. “I said, ‘I can't do this anymore.’” Flater exited the plan just before takeoff finding himself at a crossroads. That’s when he met an airline representative that would change his perspective. “I'm emotional wreck at this point,” he said. I've got some tears coming down my face. She grabs my hands, and starts praying for me… I didn't understand at the time, but it was a path that I was about to be put on.” Flater returned home and reached out to Dabill from Little Blue’s Traveling Zoo, hoping for some help and guidance in starting his new adventure. When Dabill agreed, Flater knew he could move forward. “We started searching for property up and down Highway 35,” Flater said. “This Log In Keep it Clean.

Their vests and shirts are custom made, with the vests displaying each place they’ve been and the shirts honoring 20 years of group football fun and memories. NEW ULM– Since 2003, “The Hags” have traveled across the country to see the Vikings at 20 different stadiums. The group started when Nancy Solberg was planning her 50th birthday. While with her friends Jill Hady and Pat Booker, they asked Solberg what she wanted to do. “I said, ‘I want to get out of town,” Solberg said. “They said, ‘How about going to Chicago to the Bears game?’ That started it. We did a road trip. While we were there, we decided Booker was having a special birthday the next year so then we went to New Orleans.” Hady said eight people went on the original trip to Chicago. Over the past 20 years, the lineup has changed and grown, with 13 people currently in the group. There are five who have gone every year, and the most who have gone in a single year is 12. Many either currently live in New Ulm or have ties to the area. As for why they’re called the Hags, Solberg said it was Booker’s idea. The first iteration of the Hags made their way to Chicago in 2003, as the birthday wish of Nancy Solberg. The eight members consisted of Marlene Blowers, Lisa Vosika, Traci Green, Nancy Solberg, Jill Hady, and Pat Booker (L-R back) and Lynette Wellmann with Amy Carda (L-R front) “The second year we were sitting in New Orleans in the middle of the afternoon,” Solberg said. “We decided we needed hag names because Booker had already said she was Helga. So we all came up with a name for ourselves, and it had to be an old lady’s name.” With that, Helga (Pat Booker), Sophie (Nancy Solberg), and Lena (Jill Hady) were born. Each member who has joined since also has their own hag name. The group’s most recent stop was in Atlanta, where the Vikings won 31-28 against the Falcons. Booker said while the main reason they go is for the games, they have also been able to expand their horizons while in new cities. “We go out and visit different things and see different stuff,” she said. “People have different interests. I found some things that I never thought I would go to, just because other people like that. It’s a healthy, intriguing thing to do.” All three agreed they couldn’t settle on a favorite place they’d been. They’ve enjoyed all the stadiums, met plenty of fans, and delighted in everything each city has had to offer. They also agreed New England had been one of their less enjoyable experiences. The 12 Hags who attended Atlanta in 2023, Traci Green, Linda Dietz, Jill Hady, Lisa Vosika, Amy Carda, Pat Kritzeck, Joyce Wong, Nancy Solberg, Shelley Fabian, Pat Booker, Stella Vosika, and Brenda Vanderveur (L-R), set a record for most Hags going to a single game. With the group at 13 now, they’re looking to break this record in 2024 at Jacksonville. “It should be about the love of the game,” Booker said. “I love interacting with other fans, different teams. Some team fans don’t enjoy that type of thing. They make it very clear what they think about the Vikings.” Even though there were some bad apples, the group maintained there have been lovely fans everywhere they have gone. Solberg said a prime example of this was when they were in New England. “People from up above came down and told me that I couldn’t be standing up,” she said “And all those New England fans from across the aisle came over and said, ‘We’re gonna stand with you’ and ‘She can stand if she wants.'” As the group has spent more and more time together, both on their annual trip and smaller get-togethers throughout the years, their bond has only gotten stronger and stronger. This has helped them get through rough patches like 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic forced them to cancel their annual trip. The group also suffered a devastating loss as Booker’s son Keith, who had been one of the group’s biggest fans, died at the age of 45. The whole group went to his funeral. Solberg said the group has enriched all of the member’s lives in a major way. “I don’t know what I would do without this bunch,” she said. “They are amazing. I couldn’t ask for better support or friends. It doesn’t make a difference how far apart we are or how hard it is to get us all together. When one of us needs something, the others are there.” “Weddings, funerals, births, you name it,” Hady said. “People have done benefits so we’ve contributed to those. We’re friends, we’re tight, we’re there for each other.” The group has already picked out Jacksonville as their next stop. They said when the schedule comes out, they’ll start the preparation and reservation process all over again. As for the future of Vikings football, the Hags agreed the Vikes need to secure a good quarterback first and foremost. Booker, Solberg, and Hady want the 49ers to beat the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. They believe the Chiefs have won enough. Today's breaking news and more in your inbox NEW ULM — Nobody has filed for the New Ulm City Council Ward 3 seat as of late Friday. Les Schultz currently ...

The Secret Service,” and after three subsequent films of Matthew Vaughn attempting to recapture the magic of his joyously juvenile action-comedy hit, maybe he should stop trying. His latest effort, “Argylle,” is a mirthless, brain-dead lump of a picture that can’t stop bragging about how funny and clever it thinks it is. The trailers for “Argylle” have pelted theatergoers at a nonstop clip, but for anyone who hasn’t been in a cineplex in the last four months, here’s a brief synopsis: Bryce Dallas Howard plays Elly Conway, a recently-minted writer of spy novels starring the impossibly hunky Agent Argylle (Henry Cavill, who has seemingly made some sort of deal with the devil to be excellent in “Mission Impossible: Fallout” and then never appear in a good movie again). As Elly faces writer’s block over the ending of her fifth book, she is captured by rogue spy Aidan (Sam Rockwell) who claims that The Division, an evil intelligence agency, is after her because of her novels’ uncanny ability to predict the future. If Elly can overcome her writer’s block, she can help Aiden stop the bad guys’ plot before The Division catches up and kills them both.

(AP Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta) The Associated Press//February 8, 2024// WASHINGTON — The Biden administration wants to make residential real estate transactions more transparent by unmasking the owners of certain all-cash purchases. It’s part of an ongoing effort to combat money laundering and the movement of dirty money through the American financial system. The Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network proposed a regulation on Wednesday that would require real estate professionals to report information to the agency about non-financed sales of residential real estate to legal entities, trusts and shell companies. All-cash purchases of residential real estate are considered at high risk for money laundering. The rule would not require the reporting of sales to individuals. “Illicit actors are exploiting the U.S. residential real estate market to launder and hide the proceeds of serious crimes with anonymity, while law-abiding Americans bear the cost of inflated housing prices,” FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki said in a statement. She said the proposal is an “important step toward not only curbing abuse of the U.S. residential real estate sector, but safeguarding our economic and national security.” The White House in December 2021 laid out plans to launch real estate recordkeeping requirements to increase transparency in real estate transactions, “diminishing the ability of corrupt actors to launder ill-gotten proceeds through real estate purchases.” Real estate is a commonly used vehicle for money laundering, due to opaque reporting rules on purchases. The degree to which criminal activity affects housing affordability is being studied.

ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT PERHAM — It was another battle between Section 8AA foes on Tuesday night as the Perham boys basketball team welcomed Barnesville to The Hive. The Yellowjackets jumped out to an early lead and the Trojans answered with a comeback and thanks to their defense on the final shot, escaped with a 77-76 victory. With the loss, Perham extended its losing streak to four games and dropped to 5-15 and 1-7 in section play. Yellowjackets head coach Kyle Haberman thought his team fought hard until the very end and was proud of the heart that his team played with despite the outcome not going their way. “Our team grinded tonight and fought so hard,” he said. “We have that stretch every game where we give up an eight-10 point run and we can’t get over that. Credit to them but we did a lot of good things but that last five-minute stretch we didn’t rebound the basketball and they got extra possessions. These guys deserve W’s and we’re just not there so it just has to start going our way.” ADVERTISEMENT Perham once again started the game on fire from beyond the arc. The Yellowjackets nailed six three-pointers in the first eight minutes to take a 20-13 lead. The Trojans bounced back and buckled down on the defensive end to close the gap on Perham’s lead. Barnesville tied the game 23-23 with 5:30 left in the first half. Both teams traded baskets throughout the final five minutes. Barnesville got the upper hand after Zachary Bredman splashed a three-pointer as the shot clock expired. The Trojans took a 37-33 lead into halftime after going on a 27-13 run in the final 10 minutes of the half. “They picked us apart on offense,” Haberman said. “Bredman and Gannon Bolgrean took advantage of our help defense and drove hard to the hoop. They are really good in the pick-and-roll action and chose to find the open man.” At the start of the second half, Mason Happel and Maddux Swentik hit back-to-back three-pointers to trail by one point. Barnesville halted Perham’s momentum and rebuilt their lead to 46-41 with 14:31 left in the game. The Trojans picked up their defensive intensity and forced Perham to take some difficult shots. That tough-nosed defense led to easy baskets on the other end to extend their lead to 56-46 with just under 11 minutes left in the game. The Yellowjackets chipped away at the lead but Barnesville halted all runs and stayed ahead around 10 points. The game got chippy down the stretch of the second half. The referees let a lot of contact slide and that seemed to throw Perham off their game. Barnesville led 71-62 with 4:32 when the Yellowjackets started to get some stops on defense. Ashton Detloff and Mason Happel each hit a three-pointer to cut the lead to 71-68. Barnesville was called for a push-off and the Perham crowd lit up the gym with cheers. ADVERTISEMENT “I thought we created turnovers and moved the ball faster offensively to help us get back into it,” Haberman said. “We got downhill and kicked to open shooters. I thought Alex Blume did a nice job of getting us back into it. We knocked down shots but for us, we can’t be down 10 to start. Barnesville has played a ton of close games so they know how to make those clutch plays.” On the ensuing Yellowjacket possession, Detloff gobbled up an offensive rebound and scored a layup to trail by one with less than three minutes left. Perham got a stop and fed Detloff’s hot hand on a three-pointer to gain a 73-71 lead. Barnesville regained the lead after scoring two layups to lead 75-73 with 1:25 on the game clock. Happel gave Perham the advantage after hitting a corner-three but Bredman quieted the crowd with a tough finish to take a 77-76 advantage with 32.5 seconds remaining. Haberman called a timeout to draw up a play for the final shot. Barnesville shut it down to give the Trojans a one-point victory. “It’s one of the craziest seasons I’ve seen as a coach,” Haberman said. “We are looking at an eight, nine, or ten seed at this point but there isn’t a team in the section that we can’t beat. We just have to find a way but I keep loving the guys and making sure that they believe because sooner or later we are going to be on the right side of the scoreboard.” The Yellowjackets have five games remaining in the regular season.

The report from special counsel Robert Hur, released Thursday, represents a harshly critical assessment of Biden’s handling of sensitive government materials, but also details the reasons why he should not be charged with the crime. The findings will likely blunt his ability to forcefully condemn Donald Trump, Biden’s likely opponent in November’s presidential election, over a criminal indictment charging the former president with illegally hoarding classified records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. “Our investigation uncovered evidence that President Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen,” Hur wrote. Hur’s report says evidence suggests that many of the classified documents recovered by investigators at the Penn Biden Center, in parts of Biden’s Delaware home, and in his Senate papers at the University of Delaware were retained by “mistake.” The report comes after a yearlong investigation into the improper retention of classified documents by Biden, from his time as a senator and as vice president, that were found at his Delaware home, as well as at a private office that he used in between his service in the Obama administration and becoming president. The investigation into Biden is separate from special counsel Jack Smith’s inquiry into the handling of classified documents by Trump after Trump left the White House. Smith’s team has charged Trump with illegally retaining top secret records at Mar-a-Lago home and then obstructing government efforts to get them back. Trump has said he did nothing wrong. After Biden’s lawyers uncovered classified documents at his former office, Biden’s representatives promptly contacted the National Archives to arrange their return to the government. The National Archives notified the FBI, which opened an investigation. Biden made his homes available to agents to conduct thorough searches, and that is how the most sensitive documents came to the attention of the Justice Department. Hur assessed that the evidence did not support that Biden willfully retained some of the classified documents that were recovered — including the ones at the Penn Biden Center that sparked the probe. Biden could not have been prosecuted as a sitting president, but Hur’s report states that he would not recommend charges against Biden regardless. “We would reach the same conclusion even if Department of Justice policy did not foreclose criminal charges against a sitting president,” the report said. We are pleased that this investigation has concluded and that the Special Counsel found “no criminal charges are warranted in this matter,” even if the President were out of office and a private citizen. White House lawyer Richard Sauber said Biden takes classified information seriously and “strives to protect it,” but making mistakes when packing documents at the end of an administration can be a common occurrence, as the report noted. “We disagree with a number of inaccurate and inappropriate comments in the special counsel’s report. Nonetheless, the most important decision the special counsel made — that no charges are warranted — is firmly based on the facts and evidence,” Sauber said. Part of the report centers on Biden’s handling of classified documents about Afghanistan — specifically, the Obama administration’s decision to send additional troops there — that he retained after he left office as vice president in his Delaware home. Biden preserved materials documenting his opposition to the troop surge, including a 2009 classified handwritten memo to then-President Barack Obama. “These materials were proof of the stand Mr. Biden took in what he regarded as among the most important decisions of his vice presidency,” the report said. The documents have classification markings up to the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information Level and were found in a box in Biden’s Delaware garage “that contained other materials of great significance to him and that he appears to have personally used and accessed.” Photographs included in the report showed some of the classified Afghanistan documents stored in a worn cardboard box stored in his garage, apparently in a loose collection with other household items, including a ladder and a wicker basket. Classified documents from the Obama administration were also found in Biden’s basement den, according to the report. Classified documents from his time in the Senate in the 1970s and 1980s were also found in his garage . Despite signs that Biden knowingly retained and disclosed classified materials, Hur’s report said criminal charges were not merited for multiple reasons. Those include the fact that as vice president, and during his subsequent presidency when the Afghanistan records were found, “he had the authority to keep classified documents at his home.” As part of the probe, investigators reviewed a recording of a February 2017 conversation between Biden and his ghostwriter in which, referring to the 2009 memo to Obama, Biden said that he had “just found all the classified stuff downstairs.” Biden was renting a home in Virginia at the time and consolidated his belongings in Delaware when he moved out in 2019. Prosecutors believe that Biden’s comment was a reference to the same classified records that FBI agents later found in his Delaware home. Though the best case for charges could involve his possession of the Afghanistan documents as a private citizen, prosecutors said, it was possible that Biden could have found those records at his Virginia home in 2017 and then forgotten about them soon after. “This could convince some reasonable jurors that he did not retain them willfully,” the report. The report said there was some evidence to suggest that Biden knew he could not keep classified handwritten notes at home after leaving office, citing his deep familiarity “with the measures taken to safeguard classified information and the need for those measures to prevent harm to national security.” Yet his kept notebooks containing classified information in unlocked drawers at home. “He had strong motivations to do so and to ignore the rules for properly handing the classified information in his notebooks,” the report said. “He consulted the notebooks liberally during hours of discussions with his ghostwriter and viewed them as highly private and valued possessions with which he was unwilling to part.” While the report removes legal jeopardy for the president, it is nonetheless is an embarrassment for Biden, who placed competency and experience at the core of his rationale to voters to send him to the Oval Office. “Mr. Biden was known to remove and keep classified material from his briefing books for future use, and his staff struggled — and sometimes failed — to retrieve those materials,” the report states. “And there was no procedure at all for tracking some of the classified material Mr. Biden received outside of his briefing books” In declining to prosecute Biden, Hur’s office also cited what it said was Biden’s “limited memory” both during his 2017 recorded conversations with the ghostwriter and in an interview with investigators last year. “Given Mr. Biden’s limited precision and recall during his interviews with his ghostwriter and with our office, jurors may hesitate to place too much evidentiary weight on a single eight-word utterance to his ghostwriter about finding classified documents in Virginia, in the absence of other, more direct evidence.” “We have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” investigators wrote. There is recent Justice Department precedence for criminal charges against individuals accused of sharing classified information with biographers or ghostwriters. Gen. David Petraeus pleaded guilty to doing exactly that in 2015 and was sentenced to probation. Yet in this instance, prosecutors say, Biden could have plausibly believed that the notebooks were his personal property and belonged to him, even if they contained classified information. In an interview with prosecutors, the report said, Biden was emphatic with investigators that the notebooks were “my property” and that “every president before me has done the exact same thing.” White House lawyers and Biden’s personal attorney were given the opportunity to review and comment on the report. Biden chose not to assert executive privilege over any portion of the report, White House counsel’s office spokesman Ian Sams said. Attorney General Merrick Garland in January 2023 named Hur, a former U.S. attorney for Maryland, to handle the politically sensitive Justice Department inquiry in an attempt to avoid conflicts of interest. It is one of three recent Justice Department investigations into the handling of classified documents by politically prominent figures.'}]"

Their business supported women in the East African community. The spa provided services to help women with depression, stress and any illnesses connected to the womb, Yusuf said. They provide services known as Yoni steam, hijama/cupping, facials and body scrubs, which have been traditionally used in East Africa for over 100 years, Abubakar said. Abubakar and Yusuf’s business was one of seven East African businesses destroyed in a fire on Jan. 24. Abubakar said she started this business with Yusuf because of her experiences with pregnancy and wanted to help others undergoing pregnancy. Her pregnancy questions were not answered by her gynecologist, so she turned to herbal medicine and traditional healing. “We don’t have that in this country, so when I started, there were a lot of women who were happy from East Africa,” Abubakar said. “It’s our tradition to get this service in order for us to heal our womb.” The fire affected two properties: one housed the seven businesses and the other, owned by the West Bank Community Development Corporation, housed the first licensed Somali home daycare in Minnesota. Abdi Aden, who runs the company that owns the building, said the building was burned and is waiting on his insurance to determine whether or not he can repair it. None of the businesses had insurance, according to the West Bank Business Association (WBBA). Now, they have to relocate and replace their income, equipment, inventory and furniture. Yusuf said the fire destroyed their business and now they have to start from scratch six months after they began. “We put in our time and whatever we have, we worked really hard to establish this business and we have to start from the ground again and find any sort of source that can help us,” Yusuf said. Aden said businesses both new and old were destroyed in the fire. He is helping these business owners with relocation but is struggling himself in the aftermath of the fire. “My building is burned out, I think it’s a total loss,” Aden said. “I have to rebuild and look for a loan or something like that.” The owners of the home daycare had to move out of their home and lost many personal and business items in the fire, according to WBBA. Yusuf said the impact on the community is not only financial but also emotional. “It does have a huge impact, not only on us, the owners of the place, but the people that we’d be working with, our clientele, people that have had experience with us, hoping to get the service done with us and in general just women in our community that are not able to find that sort of healing process through other health systems,” Yusuf said.

This winter was one of the warmest on record to date causing lakes in the south metro and all across the state to freeze much later than usual, as well as thaw much quicker than expected. According to the Prior Lake-Spring Lake Watershed District, Upper Prior Lake’s ice-on date this season was Jan.7, Lower Prior Lake’s ice-on date was Jan. 8, and Spring Lake’s was on Jan. 11. The ice-on dates were then quickly followed by ice-off dates as early as Jan. 23. The PLSLWD’s records date back to 1966 and show that ice-on dates are moving later and later. Records also show that it is the first year on record that Upper Prior Lake’s ice-on date occurred in January. The previous record ice-on date for Upper Prior Lake in the last 57 years was in 2015, with an ice-on date of Dec. 28. Experts at the PLSLWD say that 2015 and 2023 have strong El Niño events in common that have contributed to later ice-on dates and mild winters. Of the 25 El Niño episodes since 1950, six have been moderate, four have been strong, and five have been very strong or historically strong. The most recent very strong episode was in 2015-16, which is considered to be the strongest El Niño on record, according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Also according to the DNR, El Niño has been underway since October and is the shorthand name for warmer-than-normal surface and near-surface waters that develop and persist near the equator in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, generally for periods of nine months or more. The altered temperature patterns near the surface of the ocean, and resulting changes in the winds in that region, lead to rather substantial changes in many global weather patterns. The additional heat that originates near the equatorial Pacific often ends up distributed far and wide, producing an overall warming effect globally, according to the DNR. With later ice-on dates, early ice-off dates are quickly following across the state which is why the DNR is issuing out guidelines to stay safe on the ice. The DNR states that if new, clear ice is under 4 inches, stay off; if ice is over 4 inches it is safe to ice fish or do other activities on foot; five to 7 inches of thick ice is recommended or snowmobiles or ATVS and 9 to 10 inches is safe for a small car or SUV. Anything more than 11 to 20 inches of ice is safe for heavy duty trucks and ice houses. As of Jan. 26, the city announced that its warming house and skating rinks at Lakefront Park are now closed for the season. If ice skaters decide to go on the ice, they are encouraged to use caution as the ice is no longer being maintained.

High near 75F. Winds SSE at 10 to 20 mph. Chance of rain 50%.. Thunderstorms likely. A few storms may be severe. Low 62F. Winds SSE at 10 to 20 mph. Chance of rain 80%. Updated: June 2, 2024 @ 12:10 am Two events — the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the Orient Express train trapped in a blizzard for six days — were said to have inspired Agatha Christie’s mystery novel, “Murder on the Orient Express,” published in 1934. The story, with all its twists and turns, will come alive when Litchfield Community Theatre performs it Thursday through Sunday on the stage of the Bernie Aaker Auditorium. For this production, director Rick Beecroft is using Ken Ludwig’s adaptation, which has all the intrigue and suspense of Christie’s novel with a dash of humor to speed things along. “It’s only been around since 2017,” he said. “I’m president of the Litchfield Community Theatre board, so I was part of the show selection from the get-go. I really like this show. It’s a good plot, good murder mystery. I’ve never directed a show before and I thought let’s try this.” So far, Beecroft said it’s been a lot of fun. “I have a great cast,” he said. “Many have years of experience and some have no experience. It’s interesting to say the least. It’s 100% fun. I love the stage. I love the theater. I love all aspects of the theater.” Actor Javin Stucky, who plays the role of Hector MacQueen, secretary to the evil Samuel Ratchett, is one of the actors who brings stage experience to the play. He has performed in high school and community theater productions. “He’s anxious, nervous and doesn’t want to die,” Stucky said of his character. “I’m sometimes like him.” Stucky played a tough person in the 2022 Litchfield High School musical “Anastasia.” Now, he’s taken on the role of the exact opposite — a coward. “It’s been fun,” he said. “I like the role. If you don’t know the film, come and see the show.” MEETING HERCULE POIROT Under the direction of Rick Beecroft, the show was cast in November. The challenge was casting the play’s most high profile character — the Belgium detective Hercule Poirot. It’s an iconic role because Christie featured Poirot in 33 novels, more than 50 short stories and her first published play, “Black Coffee,” in 1930. “When I was doing the auditions, Joe (Berube) actually did a wonderful job,” Beecroft said. “I instantly recognized him as Poirot. It just fit. In all reality, as they (the actors) auditioned, I envisioned them in the roles they have. They just fit.” Casting Berube in the lead role wasn’t without some background. Beecroft was familiar with his work — he had played Col. Mustard in the local production of “Clue” last year. “He did a great job there,” Beecroft added. “I’ve known Joe for a while now. His sons are all actors and his wife is treasurer of the Litchfield Community Theatre board. It’s a great theater family.” The Berube family isn’t alone is supporting community theater. There’s a core group of people that are enthusiastic and love to be on stage. “It amazes me the level of talent in central Minnesota — dramatically, musically — the talent pool is vast,” Beecroft said. So, why see the show? The director summed it up best — “It’s a great cast, a great story.” “You’ll definitely be enthralled by the production,” he said. “These guys put in a lot of hard work. Even having seen it over and over and over again, it develops even more over time. I was speechless at the end of the show. It was amazing. It was awesome.” The following were cast: The play will be performed 7 p.m. Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Feb. 15-17, and 2 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 18, at Bernie Aaker Auditorium, 114 Holcombe Ave., Litchfield.

The luxurious train is surprisingly full for the time of the year, but by the morning it is one passenger less. An American tycoon — Samuel Ratchet —lies dead in his compartment on the luxurious Orient Express, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside. Isolated and with a killer in their midst, detective Hercule Poirot must identify the murderer, so the he or she doesn\'t strike again.

PAUL — Minnesota state Republicans have been slow to endorse former President Donald Trump\'s 2024 candidacy despite recent endorsements from Minnesota\'s Republicans in Congress. All of Minnesota\'s Republican U.S. Reps endorsed Trump this week, with Minnesota U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer posting on X, the social media formerly known as Twitter, Wednesday, Jan. 3, that it is time for Republicans to come together and support Trump. The endorsements by Emmer and Minnesota Republican representatives Pete Stauber, Michelle Fischbach and Brad Finstad come less than two weeks before Iowa\'s Jan. 15 caucus. Florida Gov. Ron Desantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christi and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy are also in the running, though Trump holds a commanding double-digit polling lead in the primary race. Emmer\'s call to support Trump is echoed by one of the few state politicians who has thrown their endorsement into the ring, Sen. Nathan Wesenberg, R-Little Falls, who endorsed Trump nearly two months ago. ""Why don\'t we just endorse Trump and focus our energy fighting the other side rather than fighting each other,"" Wesenberg said. ADVERTISEMENT The call by Emmer and Wesenberg to back Trump follows the raucous ouster of U.S. Rep. Kevin McCarthy last year from the House of Representatives speaker position. Trump helped sink Emmer\'s bid to lead the House during several weeks of party infighting that eventually led to Trump loyalist Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, securing the role. In an October 2023 statement on his social media website, Truth Social, Trump called Emmer a RINO, Republican In Name Only, and said Emmer was out of touch with Republican voters. ""Some people didn\'t like Trump, some people like him, he said some crass things or whatever but what he did was put America first,"" Wesenberg said. ""He did good things for the country and he looked out for the best interest of our citizens. He\'s already proven himself."" Minnesota has not voted for a Republican president since 1972, when Richard Nixon captured a little over 51% of the vote. Trump has been trailing Biden in Minnesota polls since May 2023, according to 538, a statistical analysis organization owned by ABC News. Trump recently closed the gap with likely voters in Minnesota, only trailing Biden by 3 percentage points in November 2023, compared to an 8-point deficit in May 2023. Nationally, likely voters have shown a preference for Trump, according to recent polls collected by 538, with Trump either breaking even with Biden or leading by single digits. “Minnesota Republicans are now openly admitting what has been obvious for a while — they have become the party of, by, and for Donald Trump,” Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Chairman Ken Martin said in response to the endorsements. “Minnesota voters have repeatedly rejected Donald Trump’s anti-democracy, anti-abortion politics and his plans to take away working families’ health insurance, but Minnesota Republicans are doubling down. Republicans up and down the ballot in November will have to answer for why they are abandoning Minnesota values and kissing Donald Trump’s ring.” While state politicians have been less upfront with their endorsements, Rep. Ben Davis, R-Mission Township, followed in Wesenberg\'s footsteps this week and also endorsed Trump. ""(Trump) represents our best chance to take back the White House and get America back on track,"" Davis wrote on Facebook. ADVERTISEMENT Once Minnesota Republicans hold their caucus in February, Trump could soon capture the party\'s endorsement statewide. State party leaders announced last month that Trump, Desantis, Haley, Christi and Ramaswamy will all be on the primary ballots this year. While Trump is likely to beat out his rivals in the primaries, his legal woes may factor into his electability. A December 2023 poll by New York Times/Siena College found that 24% of respondents who said they would vote for Trump this year said they would not if he was convicted in one of his legal trials. And while the Minnesota Supreme Court soundly rejected a lawsuit to keep Trump off the primary ballot late last year, the court reserved the right to revisit the issue following the primaries. The Colorado Supreme Court came to a different conclusion, issuing a ruling to keep Trump off the state\'s 2024 primary ballots and Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, also ruled that Trump is ineligible. Both decisions were based on Trump\'s actions during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. However, litigation filed by Trump seeks to overturn those decisions. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT'}]"

Leslie Michels, 41, Little Falls, was charged in Morrison County District Court with one felony count of fifth-degree possession of a controlled substance, one misdemeanor count of possession of an open cannabis package in a motor vehicle and one misdemeanor count of driving after cancellation. The charges stem from a Jan. 27 incident, when an officer of the Little Falls Police Department was on routine patrol on Broadway Avenue West in Little Falls. He observed a vehicle pass by him. The officer recognized the driver of the suspect vehicle as Michels. The officer was aware from multiple prior traffic stops that Michels did not have a valid driver’s license. Morrison County Dispatch confirmed Michel’s driver’s license status was still canceled. The officer stopped the vehicle and confirmed the driver was Michels, according to the report.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': '-Advertisement- About 18 months later, a few people mentioned that I should run for office — some suggested school board, others recommended city council. As an educator, I decided being on the school board would be difficult — too close to the heart — so I ran for city council and was the top voter getter. I was the first female council member in a long time, the youngest, and was the only one with children in the school district. During my council terms, I was the League of Minnesota Cities President, the Coalition of Minnesota Cities President, and the Greater Minnesota Cities President. Now I am in my first term as Ely’s mayor. I am the second female mayor of Ely — and the first married mayor. I am thrilled to say that there are now other women on the council, two are younger than me with children in the school district. We are living with the trifecta of issues: workforce, housing, and childcare. It is expensive to live and therefore build in Ely. Ely is a small landlocked city that is at the beginning of the road, so there is no thru traffic for truck routes. That means it is expensive to transport items to Ely and adds to the cost of building supplies. There also is no source of piped heating into houses; we have propane or oil trucks with delivery routes. Another hurdle is the lack of housing developer interest in Ely. The city has done its due diligence and completed a housing study; the Housing Redevelopment Authority has a waiting list for 50-plus units at market rate. I fell into real estate a few years ago when someone in our small town of Ortonville, near the South Dakota border, asked my husband and I to help with the business. Then the pandemic hit. The housing market benefitted from record-low interest rates on mortgages; low supply led to record-high sales in terms of dollars. Now we are in a strange period of rebalance. Over the past year, interest rates have climbed from the mid-2s to the mid-7s, currently settling into the 6s. We have a childcare crisis in the area. People in our town of 2,000 are brainstorming ways to develop a childcare center, or create a pod space where a few family daycares could operate. Some families are driving to neighboring towns to have a place for their kiddos to go. Many families will switch on and off with shift work, or make the tough call to have one parent stay home. As of now we don’t have the solution to the problem; the ripple effect is immense. The school district has taken on a daycare with slow-moving success, but the school has no space to expand it and little to no help from state funds in regards to helping finance a project. Our incredible rural healthcare facility is working with the community to try to help in whatever way they can. I was recently speaking with a resident in his mid-20s who rents an apartment in town. He had reached out asking about steps he could take to start looking into the home-buying process as he was feeling a bit defeated and frustrated with his current living conditions. He told me his landlord lived out of state — not even in the midwest — and it was incredibly difficult to reach him for much-needed repairs on his apartment. There are some great landlords n the area, but with so few rental options some people get stuck in frustrating rental situations. Unfortunately, we do not have much housing development in our area. Low-income housing is incredibly difficult to find in our area. We have folks calling into the office weekly asking whether we know of any rentals or contract-for-deed sellers. The good news: Ortonville has Fairway View — a beautiful, new independent living facility, assisted living facility, and nursing home all on the same campus. They recently had to close the small memory care unit, but everything else is running smoothly and with great success. As the proud head coach of our area’s Special Olympics crew, I am pleased that we do have incredible options in housing and care for individuals with developmental disabilities. The manager of local Monarch Heights group home spoke to the state legislature last year to support a bill for better pay and wages for staff working in these settings. We are very happy that it passed. I have been working to serve unhoused folks for over 25 years in the Twin Cities. In the last ten years, while leading Emma Norton Services, we have leaned into the unique needs of those with complex trauma backgrounds of homelessness, poverty, racism, and violence. In addition to having a safe place to live, facilitating recovery means people need trusted relationships that embrace the humanity in everyone. We recognize the power that a culturally diverse staff adds to attaining our mission. We are excited about a new space, Restoring Waters, that will serve 60 individuals and small families in the Highland Bridge neighborhood of Saint Paul, which is set to open in April. Restoring Waters was created with architectural lens that incorporates principles of trauma-informed and healing-based design that enhance autonomy and choice, trust and transparency, safety, collaboration and peer relationships. Above all else, the intention is to create spaces that feel homier and less institutional. For example, we created alcove apartment units, rather than studios. Having a partially walled-off bedroom space gives our residents the ability to have guests in their unit, without needing to expose their most private space. This is especially important for people in recovery from homelessness, who are more likely than the general population to have experienced sexual violence. Each of the floors has program spaces with different purposes — exercise, meditation, art, cooking, connection, and gardening. With these unique spaces, residents will be able to attend activities and classes that celebrate their cultures. Emma Norton Services was initially dedicated to serving women and children; it is now more gender expansive. The organization was founded in 1917 when Emma Norton gave a gift to United Methodist Women to fund a program to support young women and girls in Minnesota. That gift led to creation of the “Methodist Home for Girls” to house young women traveling to the Twin Cities from rural Minnesota for work and education. I work at the American Indian Community Housing Organization (AICHO) in Duluth, a nonprofit created to apply cultural strategies to real life social issues, like community and domestic violence, systemic housing crisis, and deeply embedded economic disparities based on race. We approach our work with an Indigenous mindset and our best efforts to move forward, staying true to our core cultural teachings and practices. The Indigenous mindset matters when we encounter crisis or difficult situations because it guides us in how we take care of one another. At AICHO, we are not quick to evict residents. We work to help residents determine a path that works for them. Gimaajii provides safe housing with built-in recognition that families and individuals have experienced a high level of trauma, stress, and uncertainty for an extended time, which requires a high level of care, support, and room to recover and reclaim lives. In truth, Indigenous peoples are all working to recover and reclaim our lives. We do so most effectively when we rest within our cultural strengths. We have solutions for ourselves, and we believe these solutions hold value for the world. In Minnesota, we have a critical housing challenge. We believe we absolutely can make our homelands a home for everyone, with more immediate housing options and effective cultural strategies. One of our core traditional commitments is that every community member always has a home.

If a home has mold or a structural problem, there are remedies for the homeowner. But if an HOA structure is not solid, sound, or ethical, there is very little recourse for the homeowner.

A man has been charged in Osceola for the murder of his wife. Jared Ler’che, 41, was taken into custody Jan. 23 after investigating officers found his wife, Margaret Ler’che, 34, deceased in their home in the Town of Farmington from an apparent domestic abuse incident. According to the criminal complaint, the father or Margaret Ler’che contacted the Polk County Sheriff’s Office to conduct a welfare check on her since she had not arrived at his home in Iowa as expected and could not be reached by phone. He told authorities that Margaret had planned to move to his home in Iowa with the remainder of her belongings and their two children. He also stated that Margaret and the two children had been living at the Iowa residence for the past three months. Around the same time as the initial welfare check call, the Polk County Dispatch Center received a call from a Minnesota based crisis center indicating that Ler’che had called, telling them he was driving around with his two children and having thoughts of suicide. According to the criminal complaint, Ler’che stated to the crisis line that, “he was unable to care for his children anymore, that he wished to commit suicide but would not do it with the kids around, he did not want law enforcement involved, and that he did not want to go to jail. When Jared was asked about [Margaret], he became less cooperative.” Shortly after the call from the victim’s father, Polk County Sheriff’s Officers arrived on scene at Ler’che’s home to conduct the requested welfare check. While knocking on the door, Ler’che used a Ring doorbell app to speak with officers remotely. After attempting to speak with Ler’che for a short period of time, Ler’che ended the call with the responding officers. While checking the perimeter of the home, officers looked through a basement window to find a large blanket that, “seemed out of place and stood out from the other objects in the room in the manner it was spread out.” After officers again made contact with Ler’che, he indicated several times that he felt infidelity in their relationship had been committed, saying “I think [one of my children] is a product of infidelity,” and told authorities to, “look at her deleted [messages] and figure out which one of her boyfriends she might have ran [sic] off with” when asked about Margaret’s whereabouts, according to the complaint. Ler’che continually refused to return to his home in Osceola unless all law enforcement left the residence. He was told that would not be possible. After continued negotiation, Ler’che agreed to meet officers at the Kwik Trip located in Osceola with the two children with the intent to ensure their safety before authorities entered the Ler’che residence. After doing so, officers on scene at the Ler’che home forced entry and began searching for Margaret. Upon entering the home, officers noticed dried blood on the lefthand wall of the stairwell leading to the basement. Officers proceeded to the basement noting, “additional suspected dried blood on the floor as well as marks consistent with something being drug through that suspected dried blood.” Officers then uncovered the blanket earlier seen by officers to find Margaret Ler’che deceased with a rifle and several .22 caliber shell casings next to her. Examiners also found a gunshot wound to the back of her head, a two-strand charging chord around her neck, and injuries to her head and face that indicated significant blunt force trauma. After the officers with Ler’che at the Kwik Trip were told to take him into custody, Ler’che attempted to lock his car doors and tried to reach for something at his feet, but another officer managed to get the doors unlocked. Officers managed to take Ler’che into custody and found a “short” or “sawed-off” shotgun under the driver’s seat. Officers also indicated blood splatter on his shoes. Ler’che is currently in custody at the Polk County Jail and faces one count of first-degree intentional homicide with a domestic abuse modifier. His bond has been set at $500,000 and his initial court appearance was scheduled for Jan. 30 at 1 p.m. Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language.

(Sentinel Archives) FAIRMONT — When a lanky blond-haired sophomore’s family moved to Fairmont before the start of the 2005-06 school year, no Cardinal coach could have predicted the incredible impact that Jeff Janssen would make for nine consecutive prep sports seasons. The 6-foot-4 Janssen proved the ultimate tri-athlete while donning the school’s red-and-white jersey in varsity cross country, basketball and track & field. Janssen combined his work ethic, leadership, dedication and athleticism into a mountain of Minnesota State High School League conference, section and state medals during his outstanding three-year career. The Fairmont basketball program’s No. 3 all-time leading scorer and single-game scoring record holder (41 points) and 2007 Class A state cross country qualifier made an even bigger impact on the track during the spring. Janssen medaled three times in the 800-meter run to help power Fairmont to back-to-back Class A state runner-up team showings in 2006 and 2007 before combining with classmate Paul Mallory to guide the Cardinals to the 2008 state track & field championship. Janssen and Mallory (2008) will join fellow Fairmont High School athletic greats Mike Hested (1986), Aj’a Walters Ross (2001), Blythe Bittman (2002), Sarah Rodgers Clements (2004), Mike Wubbena (2006), Eric Hugoson (2007) and legendary boys and girls tennis coach Loren Dunham in the 2024 Fairmont Athletic Hall of Fame on Saturday, Sept. 14. The 26th official class of inductees will be recognized at the Cardinals’ football game on Friday, Sept. 13, at Mahoney Field in Fairmont before returning to the high school campus the next day. A social hour will kick off the Sept. 14 event at Fairmont High School before the official program takes place at 4 p.m. at the school’s Performing Arts Center. The event is open to the public, and there is no admissions charge. After being integral parts of state-qualifying relay teams, Janssen, Mallory, Hugoson, Bittman, Rodgers Clements and Wubbena will be able to make smooth transitions to each other and Walters Ross, Hested and Dunham in taking their turns on the podium. Mallory topped the Cardinals’ football team in rushing and scoring during the 2006 and 2007 campaigns before rewriting the record books during the spring of 2008. The fleet-footed Mallory struck gold in both the high hurdles (14.51 seconds) and 300 hurdles (38.57), ran the anchor leg on the heels of Janssen’s handoff in the first-place 4×400-meter relay foursome and added an eighth-place medal with a triple jump of 42 feet, 9 inches to power Fairmont to the Class A state championship. Hugoson, who also played key relay roles during Fairmont’s pair of runner-up state track & field showings in 2006 and 2007, also left his mark in the Cardinal basketball and football record books as a three-sport sensation. Hugoson closed out his memorable hardwood court career as the No. 2 scorer in school history with 1,481 points en route to marching the Cardinals deep into the sectional tournament. The strong-armed Hugoson also quarterbacked Fairmont to back-to-back conference championship on the gridiron, eclipsing the 1,000-yard passing mark during both the 2005 and 2006 campaigns. When it comes to unforgettable names wearing the red-and-white Cardinal football jersey, no list is complete without Wubbena. The perennial all-conference, all-section, all-state running back filled the pages of Fairmont’s record books in nearly every offensive category imaginable and still maintains the majority of them nearly two decades later. The five-time state wrestling qualifier exited the high school canvas with five medals for his outstanding performances and held the program’s mark for career wins until Jaxson Rohman broke that record a couple of seasons ago. Wubbena split his high school spring sports career between track & field and baseball, excelling both on the tarred surface as a relay member and sprinter and on the diamond. Like Wubbena, Walters Ross made a big impact within the chalked lines during the spring campaigns, earning All-South Central Conference and Sentinel All-Area softball accolades for three consecutive years. Walters Ross, who was an original member of Fairmont Area’s first officially Minnesota State High School League-recognized girls hockey team in 1995-96 as a seventh-grade phenom, played an integral role in guiding the Cardinals to the sectional championship game in both 2000 and 2001. Like Walters Ross, Dunham and Hested also spent numerous days perfecting their sport — tennis — during the chilly Minnesota springs. Dunham imparted his knowledge of the artful craft of tennis to both genders for decades, coaching numerous conference champions in the process. Dunham filled the coaching void in the Cardinal girls tennis program during the late 1980s and led Fairmont to the Class AA state tournament in both 1992 and 1994. Hested, who proved a top-notch opponent on the tennis courts in the spring, played for two legendary prep mentors on the gridiron and the hardwood court. Ironically, Mike Hested played for his father, Ron Hested, during his stellar basketball career, while earning football accolades under the tutelage of Fairmont legend Thomas Mahoney in the fall. Mike Hested will join his father and brothers — Tim and Brad — as Fairmont Athletic Hall of Fame members this fall. Like Janssen and Mallory, Rodgers Clements and Bittman will rejoin forces with each other after guiding Fairmont’s track & field team to numerous True Team and MSHSL state meets. Bittman, who finished No. 6 in career track & field points at FHS, established the esteemed program’s records in the open 100, 200, 4×100 relay and 4×200. Bittman also etched her name into the No. 1 spots during the indoor season in the 55-, 60- and 200-meter races, along with the 4×200 relay. Rodgers Clements, who closed out her outstanding prep track career as the No. 2 all-time leading scorer, proved a two-time state qualifier in the 300 hurdles. Rodgers Clements, who also proved a part of the school’s No. 1 4×100 baton squad, earned a bronze medal in the 300 hurdles during the 2004 Class A state track competition.
