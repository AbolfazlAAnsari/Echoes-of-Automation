U.S. News also kept some of the more controversial aspects of its formula, such as having universities give peer evaluations of each other. “For 40 years, students and their families have come to count on Best Colleges as a vital resource as they navigate one of the most important decisions of their lives,” said Eric Gertler, executive chairman and CEO of U.S. News. “The significant changes in this year’s methodology are part of the ongoing evolution to make sure our rankings capture what is most important for students as they compare colleges and select the school that is right for them.” The new rankings showed little changes at the top. Princeton is still the No. 1 ranked school, M.I.T second and Harvard and Stanford tied for third. The bigger changes were shown further down the list and gave a boost to some state public universities while demoting some private colleges. The University of Texas at San Antonio went up 92 spots, California State University saw a bump of 88 spots and the University of Nevada at Reno increased by 68 spots. The new rankings come after many prestigious universities said they would no longer cooperate with U.S. News because of disagreements they have with their formula. “Rankings are useful only when they follow sound methodology and confine their metrics to what the data can reasonably capture — factors I’ve described in my own research on election administration,” Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken said in a statement last year. “Over the years, however, U.S. News has refused to meet those conditions despite repeated calls from law school deans to change,” Gerken added. “Instead, the magazine continues to take data — much of it supplied by the law schools solely to U.S. News — and applies a misguided formula that discourages law schools from doing what is best for legal education.” However, most schools did not follow suit and have provided the information U.S. News needed for its new list.

The research added that locally caught freshwater fish are far more polluted than commercial catches with per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) — so-called forever chemicals that are notorious for their persistence in the body and the environment. PFAS are key ingredients in jet fuel firefighting foam, industrial discharge and many household products, including certain types of food packaging. For decades, they have leached into drinking water supplies while also contaminating irrigated crops and fish that inhabit local waterways. Fish consumption has long been identified as a route of exposure to PFAS, according to the study. Researchers first identified such contamination in catfish that inhabited the Tennessee River in 1979. “Food has always been kind of the hypothesis of how most people are exposed to PFAS compounds,” corresponding author David Andrews, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group, told The Hill. But Tuesday’s study is the first analysis to connect U.S. fish consumption to blood levels of PFAS, while also comparing PFAS levels in freshwater fish with those in commercial seafood samples, the authors explained. To draw their conclusions, the researchers evaluated the presence of different types of PFAS in 501 fish fillet samples, collected across the U.S. from 2013 to 2015. These samples were acquired through two EPA programs: the 2013-2014 National Rivers and Streams Assessment and the 2015 Great Lakes Human Health Fish Fillet Tissue Study. The median level of total targeted PFAS in fish from rivers and streams was 9,500 nanograms per kilogram, while the median in the Great Lakes was 11,800 nanograms per kilogram, according to the study. These levels indicate that the consumption of such fish “is potentially a significant source of exposure” to PFAS, the authors determined. While the samples included many types of forever chemicals — of which there are thousands — the biggest contributor to total PFAS levels was the compound known as PFOS, responsible for about 74 percent of the total, the researchers found. Although PFOS has largely been phased out of manufacturing, it used to be the main ingredient in fabric protector Scotchgard, and it lingers on in the environment. PFOS is so potent that ingesting just one serving of freshwater fish would be equivalent to drinking a month’s worth of water contaminated with PFOS at levels of 48 parts per trillion, according to the study. “The extent that PFAS has contaminated fish is staggering,” first author Nadia Barbo, a graduate student at Duke University, said in a statement. “There should be a single health protective fish consumption advisory for freshwater fish across the country.” Although scientists might not know precisely how people are being exposed to PFAS, the study “clearly indicates that for people who consume freshwater fish even very infrequently, it is likely a significant source of their exposure,” Andrews said. Of the 349 samples analyzed in the National Rivers and Streams Assessment, only one sample contained no detectable PFAS, the authors determined. All 152 fish samples tested in the Great Lakes study had detectable PFAS — and had “overall higher levels of PFOS” in comparison to those in the national assessment. “PFAS contamination may be of particular concern for the Great Lakes ecosystem and the health of people who depend on fishing on the Great Lakes for sustenance and cultural practices,” the authors noted. Contamination in the Great Lakes, as well as in other lakes and ponds, may be comparatively greater than the PFAS pollution in rivers and streams because these basins don’t cycle as frequently, according to Andrews. “The water doesn’t get flushed out as quickly,” he said. Median levels of total detected PFAS in freshwater fish were 278 times higher than those in commercially relevant fish tested from 2019 to 2022. “It’s incredible how different they are,” Andrews said. The data on retail fish came from the Food and Drug Administration’s Total Diet Study datasets from 2019 to 2021, as well as a specific sampling of seafood conducted in 2022. Some commercially caught fish may be less contaminated because they are grown in controlled aquaculture environments, Andrews explained. Meanwhile, large-scale ocean fishing often occurs farther offshore, where PFAS pollution would be more diluted, he added. Andrews acknowledged, however, that the data on commercially caught fish is much more recent than the freshwater contamination figures. He also recognized that with the industrial phaseout of PFOS production, the pollution “levels in rivers and streams do seem to be decreasing, which is important.” “At the same time, the levels are still so high that any fish consumption likely impacts serum levels,” Andrews said. “But they are moving in the right direction, which I think is some good news, at least in terms of the rivers and streams.” While this study did not evaluate whether PFAS uptake is worse in some fish versus others, Andrews pointed to recent tests demonstrating that even small fish with short lifespans can amass dangerous quantities of these compounds. Last week, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services updated its “Eat Safe Fish” guidelines to limit the amount of rainbow smelt that should be consumed — based on elevated levels of PFOS. Rainbow smelt — small, silvery fish with short life cycles — are “low on the food web and don’t generally bioaccumulate chemicals,” Michigan Live reported. The Hill has reached out for comment on the study from the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team, a state Department of Health and Human Services group working on the Great Lakes contamination issue and that oversees the Eat Safe Fish program. In comparison to commercially caught fish, local freshwater fish consumption can be difficult to quantify, as “there is significant variability with respect to dietary fish intake,” the study authors acknowledged. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that the general population eats about 18 grams per day of fish, with greater consumption occurring among men and adults ages 31 to 50, according to the study. High fish consumption — eating one or more fish meal per week — is typical among anglers, individuals living along coasts or lakes, communities for which fishing is culturally important and immigrants who hail from countries where fish is a dietary staple, the authors noted. The researchers therefore characterized exposure to PFAS in freshwater fish as “a textbook case of environmental injustice” in which certain communities are “inordinately harmed.” Contamination of this food source particularly “threatens those who cannot afford to purchase commercial seafood,” the authors stressed in a statement accompanying the study. Andrews emphasized the need for both guidance for anglers and action on “this environmental justice issue” from a federal level. Attention to this subject, he added, must address “this contamination of a source of protein for many communities who rely on it both for subsistence as well as for cultural reasons.” Updated at 5:50 a.m. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Ron DeSantis’ (R) most prominent donors told reporters on Friday that he would cut off funds to his 2024 campaign if he didn’t adopt a more “moderate approach.” Robert Bigelow, the founder of Budget Suites of America and Bigelow Aerospace, told Reuters in an interview that he spoke with DeSantis’ campaign and said DeSantis risks losing Bigelow’s support unless he shifts his agenda to target moderates. “He’ll lose if he doesn’t,” he said, referring to DeSantis’ chances against former President Trump. “Extremism isn’t going to get you elected.” He added that his funding wouldn’t resume “until I see that he’s able to generate more on his own.” “I’m already too big a percentage,” Bigelow claimed. “A lot of his donors are still on the fence.” When asked what led him to the decision to curb funding, the entrepreneur pointed to what he called the governor’s “extreme positions” on policy, including the six-week abortion ban DeSantis signed into law in April. He claimed six weeks is too short, as many women don’t know they are pregnant at that stage, according to Reuters. Still, Bigelow said in the interview that he remains behind DeSantis and believes he is “the best guy for the country.” The billionaire has already given $20 million to the “Never Back Down” pro-DeSantis super PAC. He is also considered the Florida governor’s largest individual donor. The news comes as DeSantis’ campaign has struggled to meet financial expectations and amid a reset cut of a total of 38 staffers over the last several weeks. The shake-up is an effort to “streamline operations and put Ron DeSantis in the strongest position to win this primary,” according to his team. Despite the governor’s efforts on the campaign trail to visit early primary states, Trump is still leading DeSantis by double digits, according to polling averages. A new poll out of Iowa this week shows the former president ahead of DeSantis by 24 points. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Police went over to the residence, were initially denied entry by the homeowner, but they remained in the area. Police said they were initially unable to find the victim, but he eventually ran out of the house pleading for help from the officers. ""He has scarring, literally, from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet,"" St. Charles County Prosecuting Attorney Joseph McCulloch said in a press conference. Police said the two other men charged in the case, 27-year-old Nikhil V. Penmatsa and 23-year-old Sravan Penumetcha, were at the home. Police separated the victim from the other people to conduct an interview. Once he was alone with police, the victim said he was savagely beaten daily. The victim said these beatings took place in three separate locations in Dardenne Prairie, O’Fallon and Defiance, Missouri, at residences owned by Venkatesh from April of 2023 to November of 2023. The victim says his daily life included enduring severely limited food rations, sleep deprivation and “brutal assaults.” According to the probable cause statement, he had to complete morning and evening chores, work online for Sattaru\'s IT company, give Sattaru two-hour massages and was only allowed to sleep for three hours each day. At night, he was locked in an unfinished basement and forced to sleep on the concrete floor, while being watched by a video surveillance camera. If he failed to complete any of the tasks, he would be beaten. He told police the suspects used electrical wire, PVC piping and metal rods. The victim said Sattaru administered most of the beatings himself, but also directed Penmatsa and Penumetcha to beat the victim as well. ""Sattaru would sometimes call the other two defendants in this case and have them beat [the victim] over a live feed to him so he could watch it,"" McCulloch said. ""And if he didn\'t hear the victim screaming in enough pain, he would have them beat him harder."" McCulloch said the victim was related to some of the suspects in the case. He said the victim was the cousin of Sattaru. Another of the suspects was related by marriage. ""It\'s absolutely inhumane and unconscionable that one human being could treat another human being like this, but when you add to that the fact that these individuals were related,"" McCulloch said. McCulloch said the victim remains in the hospital with broken ribs, broken bones in his arms, legs, hands and feet. They shared, the victim lost more than 30 pounds of body weight since arriving to the United States. Detectives on the case said they are protecting the victim at this time and he was able to call his family in India Thursday morning. The detective said, ""We have resources in place and he will be kept in a safe place."" Sattaru was charged with: Penmatsa was charged with Penumetcha was charged with McCulloch said all three are being held without bond due to concerns that they could flee the country.

(Gray News) - A flying car called the Switchblade completed its first test flight last month. The Samson Sky team said the flight took off from the Grant County Airport in Washington state. Veteran test pilot Robert Moehle conducted the successful flight. According to the team, the Switchblade smoothly lifted off and flew to an altitude of 500 feet. Flying high above the expansive airport and surrounding foothills, the Switchblade remained airborne for nearly six minutes, then lightly touched down, completing its maiden flight. “The Switchblade handled great,” Moehle said. “I’m excited to be the first to fly it away from the ground.” Moehle has flown 2,400 hours in 56 aircraft types, including commercial and experimental aircraft. The team said his input has helped them with the Switchblade flying prototype. “After 14 years of design and rigorous testing, our first flight is a huge milestone,” said Sam Bousfield, Samson Sky CEO and Switchblade designer. The Samson team will reportedly use flight test data to finalize production engineering and build several production prototypes. “This puts us on the path towards producing thousands of Switchblades to meet the large and enthusiastic demand we’re receiving,” Bousfield said. The company said it has already seen demand for the Switchblade, receiving over 2,300 reservations. “Today is the culmination of many years of hard work and persistence to make the vision of a flying sports car a reality,” Bousfield said. The Switchblade has a maximum driving speed of around 125 mph with an estimated max flight speed of 190 mph. According to reports, the vehicle has a unique hybrid electric system. It also uses unleaded gasoline, allowing potential owners to fuel up at any gas station. Company representatives said the vehicle can be parked safely in a home garage. Owners will be able to drive their street-legal Switchblade to a nearby airport. Once there, they transform the vehicle to flying mode in under three minutes and fly their registered aircraft to their destination up to 500 miles before refueling, cruising at 160 mph.

Hutchinson said that Trump’s actions are not a good representation for the United State nor the Republican Party. “With the news that Donald Trump has been indicted for the second time, our country finds itself in a position that weakens our democracy,” his statement read. “Donald Trump’s actions—from his willful disregard for the Constitution to his disrespect for the rule of law—should not define our nation or the Republican Party.” The former governor also said the federal indictment is further proof of Trump needing to end his bid for the presidency. “While Donald Trump is entitled to the presumption of innocence, the ongoing criminal proceedings will be a major distraction,” Hutchinson said. “This reaffirms the need for Donald Trump to respect the office and end his campaign.” Trump was indicted Thursday evening on charges of mishandling classified documents at his Florida estate. In late March, Trump was also indicted on 34 counts of falsifying records for allegedly trying to disguise hush money payments. Hutchinson started his 2024 campaign by trying to position himself as an alternative to the former president just a few days after those New York indictments. The former governor is one of many running against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, including former Vice President Mike Pence and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

LOUIS (KMOV/Gray News) – A young teenager walked for more than two hours to make it to his eighth-grade graduation, and his commitment to showing up has now secured him a full-ride scholarship for his future. Xavier Jones, a 14-year-old from St. Louis, walked six miles from his home to his graduation ceremony last week because he was determined to walk across the stage and get his diploma. “If you want something done, you gotta go ahead and do it yourself,” Xavier said. Xavier is a student from Yeatman Middle School, but the ceremony was being held at Harris-Stowe State University. Xavier said his grandfather’s car was not working at the last minute, so he didn’t have a ride. “I was going to tell an adult, but my grandpa’s car was down. So, I was just going to walk there,” he said. Unbeknownst to his grandfather and the school staff, Xavier came up with a plan to get there without a ride. “I looked up Harris-Stowe University on Google Maps, and then I saw the walking distance, and then I said, ‘I could probably make it,’” Xavier said. Xavier recruited his brother and a friend to make the six-mile journey with him. “I wanted to walk across the stage,” he said. Fortunately, Xavier made it in time for the ceremony. Upon learning of the lengths Xavier took to attend the graduation, Harris-Stowe State University administrators were so moved by his determination that they promised Xavier with a full-ride scholarship to the university after he finishes high school in four years. Dr. Latonia Collins Smith, President of Harris-Stowe State University, said Xavier’s story is a reminder of the obstacles many students face. “Many of our students come with a story, and many of our students come with environmental barriers they have overcome or that they are currently overcoming,” Collins Smith said. The full-ride scholarship will cover Xavier’s cost of tuition, fees and all books someday. “I just led with my heart, and I followed my heart, and my heart said, ‘This is a kid that needs a scholarship,’” Collins Smith said. On Wednesday, Xavier received a personal tour of the university’s campus. For now, he said he hopes to be a NASCAR driver after he graduates from college.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC), passed in a 307-119 vote. Ninety Democrats joined almost all Republicans present in voting for the legislation, while 118 Democrats and one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), opposed it. Republicans have slammed the deal since it was announced in August, accusing the Biden administration of kowtowing to Iran and enabling what they consider a terrorist regime to arrest more Americans and take more aggressive action against the U.S. in the Middle East. Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas) said President Biden has signaled he is willing to “reward hostage-taking” by making a deal with Iran and that Washington must stand against Iranian aggression. “There is only one language that is understood by our adversaries,” he said on the House floor. “That is strength.” The White House has defended the decision to unfreeze the $6 billion, arguing it was necessary to release the five Americans who they considered wrongfully detained. The Biden administration also said the money can only be used for humanitarian reasons, though Iran has pledged to use the money however it wishes to. Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), ranking member of the HFAC, said “not a single penny” of the funds has been spent by Iran and that the funds would not be used for “nefarious purposes,” while arguing reneging on the deal would hurt U.S. global credibility. He also said that Biden “did the right thing” to release the detained Americans. “He brought five Americans home who were rotting in Iran’s notorious prison and every member of Congress, I repeat, every member of Congress who was aware of these cases wanted our fellow citizens home,” Meeks said. “I ask my colleagues on the other side, what do you say to those families? Do we renege on the deal?” McCaul said it would be “naive” to assume Iran only uses the money for humanitarian purposes. He added the deal was not “just about the five American hostages,” suggesting the Biden administration may have used the unfreezing of the funds to seek a revived agreement with Iran on limiting the country’s nuclear weapons development. The U.S. has denied nuclear talks were part of the deal. “There’s something else going on here,” McCaul said. “This is about the undercurrent of a deal we don’t know about.” The House passed amendments to the bill condemning Hamas and Iranian-backed groups for using human shields and calling for U.S. allies in the Middle East to condemn the groups for antisemitism. Another amendment, passed along party lines by Republicans, prohibits the use of U.S. federal funds for Iran, while a second party-line amendment states the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen are benefitting from the Biden administration’s failure to condemn them. The GOP has grown more frustrated with the deal after the Palestinian militant group Hamas invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 240 people hostage. Iran is a major funder and backer of Hamas. Iranian-backed groups have also clashed dozens of times with U.S. troops across the Middle East since the war broke out, though American troops have not been killed in what has largely been tit-for-tat exchanges of explosive drones and rocket attacks. The Biden administration announced in October, after the Hamas attacks, that Iran would not be getting the money for the time being. Officials said at the time they had reached an agreement with Qatar, which is overseeing the funds in its banks to eventually release the money to Iran, to hold the money. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also at the time said Iran hasn’t touched the money yet. The Thursday House bill, which passed out of the Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this month, would prevent Iran from touching the funds by forcing the Biden administration to implement sanctions on any foreign entity moving to unfreeze the funds for Iran. The Senate has introduced similar legislation to freeze the Iranian funds but has yet to pass it out of committee. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
