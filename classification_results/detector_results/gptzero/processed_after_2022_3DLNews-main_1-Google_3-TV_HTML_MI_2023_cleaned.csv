According to the Garfield County Sheriff’s Office, on Saturday morning, deputies were notified of a man who was found dead inside the park. His body was discovered prior to the park’s opening, and deputies said it was not related to any of the rides. The man illegally entered the park after hours when no employees or guests were around, according to the sheriff’s office. Deputies continued their investigation over the weekend and identified the man as a 20-year-old from the Carbondale area. He was initially said to be 22 years old, but investigators corrected that Monday afternoon in a news conference. The man was found dressed in black-colored tactical clothing, bearing patches and emblems that gave the appearance of someone with law enforcement. He was heavily armed with a semi-automatic rifle, semi-automatic handgun and multiple loaded magazines. He was also wearing body armor and a ballistic helmet, according to the sheriff’s office. The man, who investigators believe died by suicide, also had multiple improvised explosive devices with him and inside his vehicle. Following the investigation, several members of the bomb squad swept the grounds to ensure no other explosive devices were planted around the park or rides. The sheriff’s office said the investigation found no members of the public were at risk. “This very sad and tragic incident reminds us how much our Glenwood Springs community means to us,” Glenwood Caverns general manager Nancy Heard said in a statement. “We appreciate the swift action and thorough work of the Garfield County Sherriff’s Department and Coroner’s Office, as well as the Garfield County All Hazard Response Team and other authorities assisting in the investigation, working together to ensure the park is safe to reopen. Thank you for all you do.” There has been no further information on how the man died. “While this investigation is still ongoing and very active, it is important to realize that given the amount of weaponry, ammunition, and explosive devices found, the suspect could have implemented an attack of devastating proportions upon our community and first responders,” said the Garfield County Sheriff’s Office in a release. The Garfield County Coroner will release the identity of the suspect at a later date. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

roundup of some of the top stories from this week that we think you should know about. Don’t look now, but if the sign-stealing leaks were supposed to push Jim Harbaugh out of Michigan, that plan might have backfired. We still don’t know, officially, where the information about Connor Stalions’ sign-stealing operation came from, or how the evidence was discovered. But what we do know is it was leaked very strategically to the media, after the program won back-to-back Big Ten titles, before the most important games of the season, and while U of M was reportedly discussing an extension with Harbaugh. Read the full story here. Firefighters were attacked by a crowd early Monday morning while they were attempting to rescue two people trapped in a SUV that crashed into a building in Detroit. At around 3 a.m. on Monday, Nov. 13, a GMC Terrain crashed into a building in the area of 7 Mile Road and Terrell Avenue, just east of Van Dyke Avenue.

One of the world’s top sports broadcasters believes the Detroit Lions have the most underrated player in the NFL. That player is quarterback Jared Goff.

An Amtrak train carrying passengers from Pontiac to Chicago was derailed Thursday after crashing into a vehicle blocking the tracks, causing some travel disruptions Friday. At around 10 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 16, Amtrak’s Wolverine Train 355 crashed into a vehicle that was “obstructing the tracks near New Buffalo” in Southwest Michigan while en route to Chicago, officials said. The impact caused the train to derail, but the train did not fall over. Read the full report here. Search efforts are still underway for a traveling nurse from Michigan who is believed to have gone missing while on a hike in California. Ann Herford, 66, has been missing since Wednesday, Nov, 15, and was last seen on the Arnold Rim Trail in Calaveras County, California. Read the full report here. A plethora of self-inflicted wounds by the Maryland Terrapins helped the No. 3 ranked Michigan Wolverines cheat defeat while becoming the first football program in of any kind to reach the 1,000th-win milestone.

A federal shutdown could end up being bad news for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, people who rely on government assistance to pay for food, and those with a trip planned to one of the country’s 425 national park sites. Since the National Park Service is largely funded through Congressional appropriations, all 63 national parks, plus hundreds of additional monuments and sites, “are at risk of closing Oct. 1” if the government doesn’t reach a deal to keep the government funded, writes the National Parks Conservation Association, a group that advocates for protecting the parks. As The Hill has previously reported, it’s somewhat unclear what would happen to national parks under an upcoming federal shutdown. The Department of the Interior hasn’t announced its plan, either. The situation has played out differently in past shutdowns. For example, the parks completely shut down for some time during a 2013 government shutdown. But in 2018, during a partial government shutdown, the parks remained open — just largely unstaffed. That led to problems with trash piling up, illegal offroading, and damage to natural resources. In some instances, Joshua trees at the national park of the same name were cut down as offroaders tried to get around barriers. In both the 2013 and 2018-19 shutdowns, thousands of National Park Services employees were furloughed, leading to the closure of visitors centers and museums. That’s likely to happen in a potential 2023 shutdown, the NPCA says. Fewer rangers and park law enforcement on patrol could also make parks less safe for visitors, even if the parks are still accessible. National parks are massive and often have several access points, making them hard to cut off to the public even in situations when they are technically closed. Some national parks could stay open if states decide to use their funding to keep them up and running. The governors of Arizona and Utah, home to eight national parks combined, have said they’d consider using state funds to keep parks open, The New York Times reports. Congress has until midnight Saturday night to reach a deal and avert a shutdown. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

When a student was entering Ottawa Hills High School in the morning, the metal detector alarm sounded off as the student passed through. GRPS said public safety officers on watch at the entrance searched the 15-year-old boy's bag and found a loaded handgun. Grand Rapids Police were called, and officers arrested the student, GRPS said. Classes continued as scheduled after the incident. “It is disheartening to hear that guns are winding up in the hands of our young people as we all know the devastating consequences that can and have come as a result,” Superintendent Dr. Leadriane Roby said. “I’m proud that the systems we have in place to protect our scholars and staff worked and that this gun never made it into our hallways. But my concern for our children extends beyond the walls of our schools. We cannot tolerate our children having this type of access to guns. It’s unacceptable.” The district said this matter would be handled in accordance with school policy and the law. You can read the letter Principal Timothy Mabin sent to parents here: Backpacks were removed from schools at the end of the 2022-23 school year following four incidents where guns were confiscated from students. The backpack ban was met with opposition from the community and the district said they listened to their concerns. In the wake of those incidents, the school heightened screenings, training, weapons detectors and prevention programming among other things. ►Make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this.
