LOGIN » Updated: 1 year ago / Posted Apr 29, 2023 Editor, It has been my honor to serve the San Luis Valley as a Director on the SLV Rural Electric Co-op Board for the past four years. Now it is time for the District 7 Director-at-Large election. Note that ballots will be mailed out to members on May 11. Having learned a great deal, I believe I can contribute even more in the future and my commitment to economical, renewable energy remains strong. In addition, my re-election to the Board is important to maintain a balanced representation for the SLVREC membership. I am a voice for: For background, SLVREC, by long-term contract, buys 95% of its power from Tri-State G&T. Under this agreement, developing new solar, or any co-op owned power source, is limited to a mere 5%. Irrigation provides 60% of SLVREC annual revenues and has historically been the bread and butter of the co-op, and the reliability and affordability of that power is a primary consideration. SLVREC power usage follows a bell curve through the year with the peak in mid-summer during irrigation season. It then tapers off to a monthly peak load of 20 to 30 megawatts (MW), or about half or less of the summer peak. These seven months of non-irrigation could be well covered during the daylight hours by SLV generated solar; however, for this to occur we would need a new, more flexible, power supply contract from Tri-State, (which is not out of the question). Another key area of concern is the serious risk of wildfires and power outages. All our Tri-State power comes over Poncha Pass, a vulnerable area. One idea that is being considered is an additional line to the SLV from a different direction. I am also advocating a local option to provide both security and resiliency, which is to research and develop our own power generation here in the SLV, eliminating the need for an expensive new transmission line. Especially for isolated communities such as Creede or Crestone/Baca, an idea long utilized in remote areas of Alaska and on military bases is the use of microgrids. SLVREC will be researching this option with a state grant. Fortunately, new financial incentives and policy developments, from both federal and state levels, are helping us along this road. More about microgrids can be learned at: https://www.microgridknowledge.com/editors-choice/article/11427591/new-studies-point-to-microgrids-as-8216once-in-a-generation-solution8217. As your SLVREC Director-at-Large, I represent all members: residential, commercial and agriculture, and one of my primary aims is in making our power supply more sustainable and secure. That said, my re-election as a residential member is important - your VOTE is needed! I welcome your comments or questions and you can also visit “Wade for Slvrec” on Facebook.

Media Company Leads Revival of the Colorado Springs Independent and the Colorado Springs Business Journal Colorado Springs, CO- February 15, 2024- Entrepreneurs Kevin O’Neil and JW Roth have established Pikes Peak Media Company (PPMC) and, through this new venture, have taken ownership of two key local publications, The Colorado Springs Independent and the Colorado Springs Business Journal. This strategic move aims to revive and sustain these publications, while ensuring that these critical components of the Colorado Springs media landscape remain operational and under local ownership. Former Colorado Spring Independent Publisher, Fran Zankowski, has been named Interim Publisher and will oversee the search for a new Editor, Publisher and additional Editorial Staff. Fran most recently oversaw the Colorado Springs Independent and Colorado Springs Business Journal until its closing in December of 2023 and was previously with the publications for over a decade. “The Colorado Springs Independent and the Colorado Springs Business Journal have a 30-year legacy of outstanding journalism,” said Fran Zankowski, Interim Publisher. “Collaborating with JW and Kevin has been exciting as we propel the papers to new heights with expanded city-wide coverage. With their advocacy, the publications are set to grow and become a thoughtful voice for the city.” Under PPMC\'s stewardship the publication’s printed distribution will be drastically increased to upwards of 30,000. With printed copies directly mailed to households and placed in traditional distribution racks across the Pikes Peak region. This distribution initiative aims to triple the previous readership and engage a larger footprint of neighborhoods in the region, heralding an exciting new chapter for these publications. The initial phase and publishing schedule will commence with the Colorado Springs Independent in Spring 2024, followed by the revival of the Colorado Springs Business Journal. JW Roth, co-founder of PPMC says “As a 5th Generation Coloradan, I take great pride in providing my hometown with another trusted, civic driven, and relevant publication. This opportunity offers the Independent and the Business Journal a chance to thrive under unprecedented stability. From the feedback that we are hearing, this is a welcomed change in historical landscape.” “As a native of our region, I have invested in many businesses and organizations in Colorado Springs and this opportunity fit my focus on building a stronger community where a diverse range of voices are heard.” Says Co-founder of PPMC, Kevin O’Neil. “A robust media landscape telling all our stories makes our community better, so I am pleased to be in a position to support this effort for Colorado Springs and the Pikes Peak Region.

e-Edition Trending: For years now, I’ve kicked around the idea of writing a column about concertgoing etiquette. But I’ve always resisted doing so, figuring that the people who really needed to read it never would.Things changed this year. The concert industry not only made it out of the pandemic, it’s bigger than ever, with artists clamoring to get back on the road and fans eager to see shows rather than deal with the fear of missing out.But, somehow, concertgoers are worse than they’ve ever been. One of the wildest trend stories of the summer was recounting the numerous things people were throwing at performers on stage. Back in July, the Today Show ran a piece that compiled eight such incidents, including a mobile phone thrown at Drake and a bag containing the ashes of a fan’s mother lobbed at Pink.For me, though, the breaking point took place at a show last month at Xcel Energy Center. I was standing next to two women in wheelchairs waiting for an elevator. When the doors opened, a group of oblivious boomers rushed in and filled the space. I couldn’t believe it and when I turned to apologize to the two women, they shot back a look of sad resignation that said this wasn’t the first time something like this happened.What is wrong with people? I mean, large crowds have always been filled with awful people, but I think it got worse after lockdown. People forgot how to employ basic common courtesy to others. That, and ever-increasing ticket prices seem to have emboldened people to act like jerks because, well, they paid a lot to be there and they think they deserve it.Speaking as someone who has spent the past 19 years reviewing local arena and stadium concerts, I can confidently tell you that bad concertgoers come in every age, every race and every demographic. People who act like jerks at shows come in all shapes and sizes.The good news is that there’s an easy fix. The bad news is, well, the people who need to follow this fix probably won’t. But I’m holding out hope that at least some people don’t realize what they’ve been doing wrong and heed at least some of my advice.So, as I said, this fix is easy. People simply need to be more self-aware of themselves and others when they’re in a crowd. Just imagine how much more enjoyable not just concerts but things like grocery shopping or driving would be if more people paid a little more attention to their surroundings. That said, I do have some more tips to enhance the live music experience. I can only hope to change a few minds along the way.Prepare for the showTake a few minutes to prepare before you head out to the local hockey arena or football stadium. It’s become increasingly common for venues to email ticketholders a “here’s what you need to know” email the day prior that lists the basics like the bag policy, parking and dining options and timing for the doors opening and showtime. The same info is also available on the venue’s website for each concert.A big problem I see is at entrances. Somehow, there are people who are still surprised they need to go through a metal detector. And then there is the whole bag thing. For the most part, only small clutches, wristlets and wallets are allowed through. I’ve watched many grown women argue, at length, with security over a clutch that’s an inch or two too large.These rules are pointless, you may say while adding that a lot of it is just ridiculous security theater. I agree and I’m pretty sure the people working security do too. Do know that some restrictions may be put in place due to the professional sports league that uses the space, not the venue itself. But also remember that yelling at security about the size of your bag does absolutely nothing to change the policies, it only gets security and the people waiting in line behind you needlessly riled up.Again, a few minutes of reading before the show is totally worth it. You’ll learn the venue probably is now cashless and how many opening acts are on the bill. Large venues do not like to publicly share exact set times, but you can still get a rough idea when the main act will be on stage. The doors open time is just that, it’s when fans can start coming into the venue. Showtime is typically between one or two hours after doors open. In most cases, you can expect the opening act to start at that time or soon after. Most arena and stadium concerts are done at some point between 10:15 and 11:15 p.m.If there’s a general admission floor and you’ve got tickets for a seat, you might want to avoid arriving when doors open, because there will likely be large crowds of people waiting to ensure they snatch a prime space near the stage. If you’re not interested in the opening act, aim for arriving at the posted showtime as crowds will probably be thinner.Be thoughtfulGetting to your seat at a concert means a whole lot of interactions with both fellow concertgoers and venue employees. It’s a process that can run much smoother than it does.If you’re in a restricted place with others, like an elevator, don’t yell. Don’t honk if you’re in a parking garage or ramp. Have your phone, keys and any other metal objects out and ready to toss in the tray as you go through the metal detector. If you’re in line for a snack or a beer, decide what you’re getting before you reach the register.Once you get through security, or off an escalator, don’t stop and block the way for people behind you. When you’re walking through a crowd, put your phone in your pocket and pay attention to where you’re going and the people around you.Don’t be a jerk to security or other venue employees, some of whom might be volunteers working concessions. Keep in mind that while you’re there to have a good time, they are there to work. That work is easier and more enjoyable if the workers don’t have to deal with rude concertgoers.Once you’re at your seat, enjoy the concert. Also, be aware of group dynamics at play. If everyone in your section decides to stand, you will have to as well if you want to see the stage. If everyone is dancing along, feel free to join in if that’s your jam. If everyone around you is sitting down and you want to dance, go ahead and do so. But don’t move into other people’s space and by absolutely no means should you yell at those around you to loosen up. Everyone hates that, trust me.Singing along to songs is fine and some acts openly encourage it. Don’t yell along to songs. Think about enjoying the concert in ways that allow others to also enjoy the concert and not spend time giving you dirty looks. (This is Minnesota, where dirty looks are a thing.)Many people drink at concerts and that’s cool. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of seeing a show. But don’t be sloppy. Don’t spill beer on people around you. And absolutely without a doubt, if you’ve had too much to drink and are feeling queasy, get yourself away from people and into a bathroom stall as quickly as possible. Throwing up on people at a concert should be, at the very least, a misdemeanor. (Call your representatives and demand action!)After the showGetting out of concerts is much easier if you walked, biked or took public transit to the venue. (I’ve taken the Green Line to nearly every U.S. Bank Stadium show and never had an issue.) And there’s always the option to catch a drink or snack at a nearby bar while you watch the crowds dwindle. Do know that large venues don’t like crowds to hang around inside after the show is over.If you did drive, it’s the time for you to put that phone of yours to work. Driving away from a venue usually means bottlenecks at parking ramp exits and nearby intersections. And remember that the larger the show, the more likely there will be people from out of town who aren’t as familiar with the streets around a venue. I’ve long since used an easy trick to get out faster.Open the map app on your phone, input your final destination and then ignore it. Free yourself from the notion of a single path home and think about it in terms of following the path of least resistance. Use sidestreets or whatever it takes for you to get away from other cars. Then let the phone guide your way from there. Your trip may take longer than expected, but it’s a better option than wasting time in a slowly moving'}]"

Check out all of our newsletter offerings! Elbert County News An Elbert County mother, Jessica Capsel, recently filed a lawsuit against the Elizabeth School District alleging the school board violated open-meetings law. The incident that led to the suit occurred at the Sept. 11 board meeting, when the Elizabeth School Board passed a “Resolution to Keep Elizabeth Schools Open and Education Unrestricted,” opposing mask and vaccine mandates. Capsel, who moved to the area in 2019, has two children and holds degrees in writing and public health but currently works as a child nutritionist. Wherever she’s lived, she has always tried to pay attention to school board meetings and participate in the district. “You can’t just assume that the school board is doing things in the best interest of the students,” she said. Capsel believes the district violated the Colorado Open Meetings Law (part of the Colorado Sunshine Law) by adding the resolution to the agenda at the last minute, therefore not giving parents or community members a chance to read and respond to the resolution beforehand. Capsel said she pulled up the agenda at 2 p.m. the day of the meeting and did not see the resolution listed. When she looked again around 6 p.m., the time the board meeting was set to start, she saw the link to an amended agenda and another link to the resolution. She feels like the resolution came out of nowhere, with no discussion beforehand at previous meetings and without opportunity for input. The posted resolution was already dated Sept. 11 so it seemed like a foregone conclusion that it would be passed by the board. Capsel said she didn’t want to file a lawsuit but that, “anyone who violates an open meeting law is only held accountable if a citizen files a lawsuit. That’s the only way to get someone to look at it and pay attention.” She feels that she “can speak up in a way that other people in the community can’t because they have ties to the district.” In a March article from Courthouse News Service, Jeremy Meyer, spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Education, spoke to this issue, “There is no Colorado state agency that oversees local school districts’ compliance with the open records and open meetings laws.

Reader contributions make up 75% of our revenue and are key to the future of healthy independent media. High Country News A nonprofit independent magazine of unblinking journalism that shines a light on all of the complexities of the West. Recently, the balance of this column has swung toward prodding you with questions and challenges, but triumphs and good news are a lot of fun to share, too, so I’d like to tell you about all the exciting happenings at HCN. HCN Poetry Editor Paisley Rekdal begins her tenure this month as the new director of the University of Utah’s American West Center, which researches the history and culture of our region. In other news, her latest book, West: A Translation, a collection of poems and essays about the transcontinental railroad, was released in May by Copper Canyon Press. Senior Editor Emily Benson and contributor Madhushree Ghosh have each had a story, both from September 2022, selected for the 2023 Best American Series anthologies. Ghosh’s “On the road, a taste of home” will be included in The Best American Food Writing and Benson’s “The Climate Underground” will be in The Best American Science and Nature Writing.

Credit: Photo illustration by Marissa Garcia/High Country News Staff writer B. “Toastie” Oaster was selected to partner with ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network to work on an investigative project to be published later this year. Also, “Underwater Legends,” their 2022 feature about the relationship between the Pacific lamprey and Northwest tribes, was a finalist in the 2023 National Magazine Awards — up there with the industry’s highest honors! Contributing Editor Melissa Chadburn’s novel, A Tiny Upward Shove, was longlisted for the PEN/Hemingway Award for Debut Novel. Susan Shain has joined HCN as a New York Times Headway fellow; she spent the first year of her fellowship at the Times but will spend the upcoming year as part of our newsroom. Contributor Sarah Sax’s story “Unbearable Heat,” from June 2022, about the horrifying conditions inside Washington’s prisons, has racked up multiple awards — First Place for Investigative Reporting from the Newswomen’s Club of New York, a writing award from the American Society of Journalists and Authors in the category of Social Change and finalist for the 2023 Victor K. McElheny Award from the MIT Knight Science Journalism Program. And, best of all, it’s been cited by officials investigating the issue. Thank you to all the readers who told us how this story inspired them to take action on behalf of incarcerated people. HCN’s production team — Cindy Wehling, Roberto “Bear” Guerra and Luna Anna Archey — notched up two notable achievements: Alex Boersma’s illustration for “Salmon in Troubled Waters” in the July 2022 issue was a Society of Publication Designers Merit Winner, and the October 2022 cover, featuring a photo from June T Sanders, was a finalist in the American Society of Magazine Editors’ Best Cover Contest for Best News and Politics Cover. And that’s just what I can fit into this month’s column! Join me in giving them all a hand. We’re lucky to have such a talented crew, and to have readers like you: Your support through subscriptions and donations is what keeps this all going. Thank you from everyone at High Country News. Credit: Jon Rizzo, Grand Junction, Colorado Question of the month Thank you for all your responses to my question about bumper stickers in the May issue. You sent in some great sticker ideas about conservation, dam removal … and getting “high.” We have a few new designs off to the printer. Get in touch at dearfriends@hcn.org if you want one. This month’s question is: What’s your watershed address? To find it, start with the stream or creek nearest to your home, trace it to your nearest river or wetland and keep finding the next bigger body of water until you reach the ocean. Send your watershed address to dearfriends@hcn.org. It’s a question you might have seen before if you follow conservation or water groups, but I wanted to put it to HCN readers to see where we overlap … other than the Pacific, that is.

'pageNumber': 0, 'inputText': ""Friday, November 3, 2023 | Number of views (7243) I’m sitting at the base of a gnarled pinion pine tree in the middle of the woods behind the Bader-Snyder complex. It’s dark and the rain has been pounding the saturated soil relentlessly, but I am dry, and looking up at my protector, the arching branches that stretch around me like arms. The smell of earth, wet bark and seeping sap mingle in my nose as I close my eyes, work my toes deeper into the dirt and press my hand to my aching heart. This isn’t just any old tree. It’s the Zoe tree. It’s adorned in shimmering beads that dangle and dance in the air. A wood sign is painted with the name Zoe and surrounded by flowers, rivers, mountains, and fire, and is nailed to a prominent bough. There’s a small pink ski that sits in the trunk. Individual mementos stand by the roots, like little soldiers protecting their base. Sitting on one side is a chair made of rocks that were carefully placed and painted. Bunches of flowers occupy the space as well because what is a memorial without wilting petals? This is the dedicated memorial to my roommate and dear friend, Zoe Coughlin-Glaser, who died in a car accident right before this school year started. The tree is a place to bring people together and closer to the memory of her, in the woods that she explored and ran rampant in, surrounded by frisbee golfers and wandering students, this is where she can be remembered. Looking up into the arms of the Zoe Tree Zoe was a biology student at Fort Lewis College who lived life more curiously than anyone I’ve ever met. She raced for the Alpine Ski Team on campus, joined the pottery club, created art, consumed new music every day, changed her hair at the drop of a dime, collected rocks and disregarded objects that no one else would notice, cared for plants and cats and made friends wherever she went. There was never a day that she let pass her idly by. I would come home, and she’d be crouched on the floor or at the dining room table, surrounded by beads or colored pens with her journal open, ready to tell me her thoughts and stories, and I miss her. Since Zoe died, I’ve been feeling your presence very close to me, Death, and I have questions. Why am I writing this? Is it to find some sort of closure? To commemorate the life of my friend who touched so many others in Durango? Or am I just a maniac who likes to dwell in the pain of it all? Yes, yes and maybe. What feels the most correct to me, is my existential need to face death head on and not be afraid to grapple with it. But what does it all mean? To live, to love, to connect, to be a human, to die, and to move forward, for both the people leaving and the ones who get to stay. All humans think about death. It’s one universal factor besides birth that we have to deal with at some point. It’s inevitable and can be scary. So, what is death, and why are we so afraid of it? Christine Pollock is an end-of-life doula who for 15 years has been working with dying people and their families to help them work through their baggage and fears regarding death, and try to create a sacred, loving and clear space for those who are transitioning. Pollock said that the experience is very beautiful, and that her line of work is an honor and something that chose her after she supported a close friend at the end of her life. Death is on the other end of birth, is a part of life, and the two are not in opposition to each other, she said. Death is the great unknown, and is only what we can imagine it to be. “We enter into this world in a form, and we’re going to exit this world and leave the form,” Pollock said. Dr. Brian Burke, a psychology professor at FLC, said that humans, as far as we know, are the only species aware of our inevitable death, and therefore we can project ourselves into the distant future and imagine what the process might be like. He said that although this can be a great advantage, to be able to plan and build a future, it’s also terrifying and a problem of survival that humans have to deal with. The Terror Management Theory, created by the social psychologists, Jeff Greenberg, Tom Pyszczynski and Sheldon Solomon, helps people cope with their conscious or subconscious fears of death and threats to existence by investing deeper into one’s cultural worldviews, the things that we feel most connected to, in order to protect us from those fears, Burke said. This theory was inspired by the work of Ernest Becker, a cultural anthropologist, who believed that as humans, we want to live a meaningful life and be considered as a valuable contributor to our own chosen groups, he said. “I think that's why, when we're thinking of death, we come back to that cultural worldview,” Burke said. “Because we need the feeling of self-esteem, which is a fancy word for just saying we need to feel like we're a valued part of something.” After Zoe’s death, I found myself searching for my place in the world without her. I remember the morning vividly when I found out that she had passed. I was sitting on the edge of my bed in my pajamas, when her dad called and told me what happened. I started crying, shrieking, repeating the words, ‘oh my god’, over and over again, throwing on a long white dress before running barefoot down the street, two blocks to our friends house, the one Zoe was planning to move into, where I clutched the porch railing with white knuckles and uttered the news for the first time. More people came to the house as the news spread. We all reeled in the shock of death and shared stories about Zoe, trying to feel her spirit through human connection. It’s a natural human reaction, as interpersonal creatures, Burke said, to run towards other people and loved ones when we are faced with danger. In this case, the death of a dear friend. In the face of death, I have been, and still am, running towards the people that will hug me and cry with me, as we attempt to keep each other safe. Finding connections that make sense to the individual person—whether that be to people, nature, animals or anything else one values is crucial when dealing with death, Burke said.

unhoused to cohousing for renters. Now, some local leaders are floating the idea of creating a social housing program in Denver to, as they say, provide some permanent relief from rising housing costs. Photo: Brandon Griggs/unsplash District 8 Councilmember Shontel Lewis introduced the idea during a Budget & Policy Committee meeting on August 7, when she proposed funding a study about creating a social housing program in Denver’s 2024 budget. She said the idea was one she heard consistently while on the campaign trail. “What I am trying to get to is that we are taking a more comprehensive approach to how we are addressing the issues of housing and homelessness at the same time,” Lewis said during the meeting. The term “social housing” can refer to many things, but New York University’s Center on International Cooperation defines it as a model that prioritizes the “social value of housing for communities over its ability to generate profits for a select few.” These models can be subsidized by the government or run by not-for-profit entities. Social housing and public housing are often talked about synonymously, but they serve different purposes. Social housing differs from public housing in that it can serve both middle and low-income households, whereas public housing is reserved for people earning the lowest incomes. Social housing units can be offered on the free market and frequently cap rents for tenants at 30% to 35% of their income. The economic blend of tenants in social housing development also allows for higher-income tenants to effectively subsidize rents for lower-income tenants. On the other hand, public housing operators often require vouchers to access and rely on government reimbursements to manage their cash flow. Social housing is common in European countries like The Netherlands, where social housing units make up 29% of the overall housing stock, according to data from Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies. Austria, Denmark, and England also have robust social housing programs. Stateside, the idea is still relatively new. Seattle was one of the first U.S. cities to experiment with social housing when voters passed Initiative 135 in February. The initiative created a new development authority called the Seattle Social Housing Developer that is tasked with expanding the local public housing stock, but the entity’s work has yet to begin. California legislators are also toying with the idea of creating a statewide social housing development authority. For example, Assembly Bill 309 would require the new development authority to build up to three social housing projects on excess state-owned land. Similarly, Senate Bill 555 and Senate Bill 584 would establish social housing development goals and levy additional fees and taxes against short-term rental properties to support social housing developments. Lewis told Denver VOICE in an interview that she has pitched the idea of creating a social housing program to some city councilors as well as constituents who call her office to talk about housing issues. She added the response has been mixed, with some expressing reservations about the legality of Denver owning and operating real estate and the practical aspects of the program itself. “The reality is that this type of housing impacts a lot more people than we are currently talking about,” Lewis said. Councilwoman Sarah Parady, one of Denver’s at-large representatives, told Denver VOICE in an interview that she supports the idea of creating a social housing model in the city. Outside of capping rents, Parady said social housing could also provide renters with more legal protections against eviction because renters who live in municipally-run social housing units would be able to assert their constitutional rights during a dispute. However, there is an open question regarding whether Denver can own and operate real estate at all. Both Lewis and Parady said they believe Denver’s ordinances allow the city to own and operate its own housing developments. Parady also said the city attorney’s office disagrees with their perspective. “I think the big question is whether we can convince people that social housing is worth the lift of cutting through all the complexity to make it happen,” Parady told Denver VOICE. “We have such a large affordable housing shortage and that has become so urgent that solving the problem is viewed as an uphill climb by a lot of people.” While discussions about social housing in Denver are preliminary, there seems to be some disagreement about how a social housing model would work in Denver. One key component of this model is what’s known as “democratic resident control,” which essentially means that social housing tenants would form an association similar to a homeowners association. Shannon Hoffman, who advocated for social housing during her campaign for the District 10 seat on Denver City Council, said she would like social housing tenants to be required to serve on their tenant’s association as a way to promote a community dynamic within a building. She added that this idea is where her thinking diverges from other people she’s talked to about social housing. “We need an innovative and creative solution to our housing crisis, and we need affordable rents,” Hoffman told Denver VOICE in an interview. There is also the practical problem of creating a new social housing development entity outside of the Denver Housing Authority and finding land to accommodate social housing developments. Hoffman said there has been talk about introducing a ballot initiative to create such an entity, but those discussions are preliminary as well. Land issues surrounding social housing may prove to be easier to navigate given Denver Mayor Mike Johnston’s willingness to try innovative housing programs. For example, Johnston is working to fulfill his campaign promise to create micro-communities of tiny homes and shelters to help people escape homelessness. However, land the city identified that could support such sites is primarily concentrated in historically underserved communities, Axios Denver reported. Lewis added that she is concerned about further concentrating poverty in places in Denver that “have a lot of affordable housing already.” Despite the disagreements, social housing supporters say the idea could help alleviate some of the pains caused by Denver’s unaffordable housing market. As of July 2023, there were just 563 homes for sale in Denver, a decline of 39% since July 2020, according to the Colorado Association of Realtors. Meanwhile, Denver’s median home price in Denver County was $696,500, which represents an increase of nearly 30% over the last three years. Similarly, the Metro Denver Apartment Association measured the city’s average rent at $1,870 in July, an increase of about 11% over three years. The average weekly wage in Denver, on the other hand, has only increased by 7.4% over the same time period, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. Hoffman said that the city’s affordable housing challenges are also straining the local community. Teachers, firefighters, and service industry workers all struggle to afford housing in Denver, and the city wouldn’t function well without them. To that end, a social housing program in Denver could provide a safety net for workers who can’t afford the cost of living, she said. “We’re getting to the point where we don’t have much time left to sit back and think about this problem,” Hoffman said. “What we’ve been doing hasn’t worked, and we need to find new solutions.” Click here for resources for people experiencing homelessness in Denver.

(Maine News Service) The latest research finds the Gulf Stream has warmed faster than the global ocean over the past two decades, and has shifted toward the Atlantic coast. Scientists say the ocean current, which carries tropical water up the Eastern Seaboard, has warmed two degrees Fahrenheit since 2001 and could be pushing warmer water into the Gulf of Maine. Robert Todd, an associate scientist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said years of data collection confirm what climate models predicted. ""Long-term ocean observing really is important,"" said Todd, ""and we need to keep making those observations so we can understand what\'s actually happening in the climate system."" Todd said ocean temperatures are steadily rising as a result of human activities. He said the findings could determine how changes in the Gulf Stream will impact Maine\'s coastal industries. The Woods Hole study relied on more than 25,000 ocean temperature and salinity observations collected through the Argo Program - an array of some 4,000 floating robots throughout the global ocean. In addition, underwater gliders have slowly navigated the Gulf Stream - revealing warm rings of water, which Todd says could enter the Gulf of Maine and alter marine environments and species. ""You can imagine if you have an organism that likes cold water, and suddenly the water is a whole lot warmer because this ring was there,"" said Todd, ""those organisms might not be there anymore or might suffer - and then, the fisheries associated with that would suffer."" The Gulf of Maine - which stretches from Cape Cod in Massachusetts to Nova Scotia, Canada - is already considered one of the fastest-warming ocean regions on the planet.

LOGIN » By: Staff Report Updated: 6 months ago / Posted Nov 15, 2023 SAN LUIS VALLEY —The ballot for this year’s election was limited with voters being presented with a smaller than typical number of decisions to be made. Statewide, voters decided on Proposition HH. A “yes” vote lowers property taxes owed, allows the state to keep additional money that would otherwise be refunded to taxpayers, temporarily changes how taxpayer TABOR refunds are distributed and creates a new property tax limit for most local governments. A “no” vote maintains current law for property taxes, TABOR refunds and state and local government revenue limits. As of 8 p.m., Proposition HH received 679,346 (60.76%) no votes and 406,621 (33.96%) yes votes Statewide, voters also decided on Proposition II. A “yes” vote allows states to keep and spend $23,650,000 in tax revenue that has already been collected from the sale of cigarettes, tobacco products and nicotine products and to maintain the current tax rates on cigarettes, tobacco products and nicotine products. The tax revenue will be spent on preschool programs. A “no” vote means that $23,65 million will be refunded to wholesalers and distributors of cigarettes, tobacco product and nicotine products and tax rates on those products will be reduced. As of 8 p.m., Proposition II received 684,576 (66.04%) yes votes to 352,082 (33.96%) no votes. Monte Vista City Council Two seats on the Monte Vista City Council were being decided by voters on Tuesday and based on initial unofficial results, incumbent Loren Howard (431 votes) had a sizeable lead while newcomer Bradley Watson (324) held a slim lead for the second seat over newcomer Sheila Sanders (316) and incumbent Martha Lock (297). Sanford School District BOE Three four-year terms and one two-year term was up for grabs on the Sanford School District Board of Education on Tuesday. Initial unofficial results showed Brock Canty (248 votes), Austin Miller (196) and Ryan Keith Reynolds (188) leading in the four-year term races, followed by Joshua C. Jones (165) and Micah Lanar Larson (165). In the two-year term contest, Dylan S. Mortenson had 271 votes and was well ahead of Thomas Dale Rodgers with 114 votes. Center Consolidated School District BOE Two at-large seats on the Center Consolidated School District Board of Education were before voters on Tuesday. According to initial unofficial results, Lloyd M. Garcia (295 votes) and Richard J. Barela (138) were the top two, followed by Marisa Renee Aguilar (85) and Pablo M. Lopez (74). Kimberlee Ann Duran ran unopposed to represent District C on the Center BOE. Center Fire Protection District Issue 7A Center voters were slightly in favor (56.77 percent) of increasing Center Fire Protection District Taxes $86,752 annually beginning in collection year 2024 and by such amount as may be generated there after by the imposition of an additional two mill levy increase bringing the total mill levy to 6.924 mills to maintain and improve fire protection, emergency services, and ambulance services. Creede School District BOE Incumbents Kara Jo Brittain (408) and Casey Adelman (341) based on initial unofficial results on Tuesday were on the way to retaining their seats on the Creede School District Board of Education over Lori Heinrich (251).

An increase in business during the 2022-23 ski season by resorts in the White River National Forest resulted in higher fees paid to the U.S. Treasury for use of public lands. The 11 ski areas in the White River National Forest — including those operated by Aspen Skiing Co. and Vail Resorts — set a record in 2023 for the amount of fees paid to the federal government for use of public lands. The ski areas paid a cumulative $26.02 million, or about 9.5% more than the $23.76 million paid in fiscal year 2022, according to information provided by the U.S. Forest Service. The amount was greater than the level established prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, which stunted the ski industry’s business and thus the amount of fees paid during the 2019-20 season. The pre-COVID record was $23 million in fiscal year 2018. The federal government uses a complex formula to determine the size of a fee paid by a ski area. The critical factor in the formula is how much national forest land is used for ski-area operations. Ski-area business — from lift tickets sold to ski lessons provided and even meals sold at on-mountain restaurants — also factors into the fee amount, depending on how much terrain is federally owned. Critics of the formula contend ski areas should be paying more, given their revenue and profit levels. White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams has repeatedly defended the fee structure and said ski-area fees are equitable to fees paid by other users of public lands. Fitzwilliams said the $26 million paid in fees for fiscal 2023 reflects a strong winter for the ski industry in 2022-23 as well as the increase in summer activities and long-term trends by the industry in resort infrastructure. Investments in chairlifts, terrain and summer amenities over the last decade are designed to keep customers returning, both summer and winter, Fitzwilliams said. During a break between snowstorms on Saturday, a skier at Snowmass begins his descent. The Colorado ski industry shattered its skier visit record last season when it logged about 14.8 million visits. Aspen Skiing Co. officials said they experienced “a very strong year” with skier visits increasing 7% compared to the season before. Those state and local trends dovetail with what the ski industry as a whole reported. The National Ski Areas Association projected 65.39 million skier visits last season, breaking the record the U.S. ski industry set the season before. But Fitzwilliams said the effort by ski areas to beef up summer attractions in the last decade also has impacted the amount of business and fees paid to the U.S. Treasury. “The summer businesses are adapting, morphing, changing with people’s desires,” he said. “It’s certainly becoming a bigger part of their business. There’s more activity in the forest on the mountains in the summertime. That was the intent of the summer uses legislation when Congress allowed for expanded uses on national forests.” The federal government collects about $40 million annually from fees paid by ski areas across the nation. The 11 ski areas on the White River National Forest account for about two-thirds of those fees. “That’s been consistent for a number of decades,” Fitzwilliams said. The ski areas in the White River include Aspen Mountain, Aspen Highlands, Snowmass, Buttermilk and Sunlight Mountain Resort in the Roaring Fork Valley; and Vail Mountain, Beaver Creek, Arapahoe Basin, Keystone, Breckenridge and Copper Mountain in Eagle and Summit counties. Ski Cooper outside of Leadville is divided between the White River and San Isabel national forests. The Forest Service reported the amount of fees paid by individual ski areas until 2017. Vail Resorts objected to the release of information because it said competitors could ascertain business secrets by extrapolating information from the individual fee amount. The Rocky Mountain Region of the Forest Service supported a change in how fee amounts were released despite the setback to transparency. Aspen Skiing Co. has traditionally paid the largest fee amount for Snowmass Ski Area, which has 4,997 acres of public lands within its ski-area boundary. Aspen Highlands has 1,620 acres of public lands within its boundary while Buttermilk has 835 acres, according to information previously provided by the White River National Forest. Aspen Mountain, which is covered with privately-owned mining claims, had only 326 acres of public lands within its boundary though that might have increased with the opening of the Pandora’s terrain this season, now known as Hero’s. The dollars collected by the federal government for use of public lands by ski areas goes into the U.S. Treasury. It’s not retained by the U.S. Forest Service even though the agency incurs expenses overseeing operations and development plans of ski areas. U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado, has co-sponsored legislation in recent sessions to change how the feds treat ski-area fee revenues. The Ski Hill Resources for Economic Development Act, known as the SHRED Act, would keep a portion of the revenues local. The legislation would allow 80% of the fees available for authorized uses within the forests where they are collected. For the White River, that would mean $20.8 million would be retained from the fees paid last year. The other 20% of fee revenues would be available to assist any national forest with winter or broad recreation needs. The prospects for passage of the bill are unknown in this fractured Congress. Fitzwilliams said the $26 million collected for 2023 in ski-area fees is relatively meaningless since it goes back to the vast federal treasury. “I would get more excited about that number if the SHRED Act would pass,” he said. “It doesn’t matter how much that increases, it doesn’t really help us in any way.” The $26 million isn’t a blip in the federal budget but it could mean a world of difference to the White River National Forest. “I’m still hopeful that law will get passed,” Fitzwilliams said. “I think it would be appropriate that some portion of those fees come back to where they’re generated.” scott@aspendailynews.com Reporter Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers:'}]"

Sentinel Colorado The source for greater Aurora, Colorado PORTLAND, Ore. | An Oregon weekly newspaper has had to lay off its entire staff and halt print after 40 years because its funds were embezzled by a former employee, its editor said, in a devastating blow to a publication that serves as an important source of information in a community that, like many others nationwide, is struggling with growing gaps in local news coverage. Sign up for our free newsletter to receive the latest news Sign up for our free newsletter to receive the latest news About a week before Christmas, the Eugene Weekly found inaccuracies in its bookkeeping, editor Camilla Mortensen said. It discovered that a former employee who was “heavily involved” with the paper’s finances had used its bank account to pay themselves $90,000 since at least 2022, she said. The paper also became aware of at least $100,000 in unpaid bills — including to the paper’s printer — stretching back several months, she said. Additionally, multiple employees, including Mortensen, realized that money from their paychecks that was supposed to be going into retirement accounts was never deposited. When the paper realized it couldn’t make the next payroll, it was forced to lay off all of its 10 staff members and stop its print edition, Mortensen said. The alternative weekly, founded in 1982, printed 30,000 copies each week to distribute for free in Eugene, the second-largest city in the state and home to the University of Oregon. “To lay off a whole family’s income three days before Christmas is the absolute worst,” Mortensen said, expressing her sense of devastation. “It was not on my radar that anything like this could have happened or was happening.” The suspected employee had worked for the paper for about four years and has since been fired, Mortensen said. The Eugene police department’s financial crimes unit is investigating, and the paper’s owners have hired forensic accountants to piece together what happened, she said.

(Colorado News Connection) It\'s been 50 years since Congress passed the Endangered Species Act, which is credited with helping wolves rebound from near-total extinction in parts of the Northern Rockies and Western Great Lakes regions. Ryan Sedgeley, Southern Rockies field representative with the Endangered Species Coalition, said the decision to reintroduce gray wolves in Colorado - which aims to help the animals continue to rebound by reconnecting throughout their native range - was a democratically driven process, not a top-down decision by the federal government. ""This is a tremendous conservation success, and it\'s unique in that it was brought about by a ballot measure. So voters were the ones who decided that this is something that they would like to see,"" he said. Colorado voters approved bringing wolves back to the state in 2020, but some members of Colorado\'s ranching community expressed concerns about the potential loss of livestock. The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission is expected to release 10 to 15 animals from Oregon on designated lands west of the Continental Divide by the end of December. Wolves are apex predators and play an important role in ecosystems. They help keep ungulate populations in check by culling sick animals, and keep elk moving near waterways, which allows budding willows and aspen shoots to thrive. Sedgeley said the new law will compensate ranchers who lose livestock, which is actually very rare, but there are proven ways to keep wolves at bay. ""In these areas where ranchers have gone out and started doing preventive work - which includes using range riders, dogs, flaggery to scare wolves off - the conflicts are basically zero,"" he added. Sedgeley said wolves and people can co-exist. Keep your pets close and on their leash when on trails, and to ensure wolves remain scared of humans, never feed these wild animals that can look like friendly dogs. He said that wolves can be a major contributor to local economies. People come from across the globe, and spend money at hotels and restaurants, for a chance to see these animals in the wild. ""Up in the Yellowstone area, it contributes billions of dollars to those economies every year. So it\'s a real opportunity in Colorado to continue to build our strong tourism sector with more wildlife watching,"" he said. Kiowa County Press - 1208 Maine Street, Eads, Colorado 81036.

“Flowering Eulogy” is a tribute wrought from tragedy.On March 21, 2021, a man carrying a semi-automatic rifle shot and killed 10 people at a supermarket in Boulder. The local community, shocked by the event and stunned by the loss of friends, family and neighbors, reacted with grief, and began transforming the site of violence into a tender memorial with “hundreds of bouquets of flowers of all sizes, browned and blackened and standing there as a love offering,” according to Hernando.After awhile, the city of Boulder collected the material and gave much of it to Hernando with a request to transform it through her artist’s perspective. She spent many months turning it into compost in her own backyard. On the second anniversary of the event, she presented her piece to the public, in small, brown-bag packages of the fertile, earthy material, accompanied by a letter of introduction and a package of wildflower seeds.I asked her to help us understand the piece and her process.Q: I want to start with a difficult question, but one that I think is important: Can you tell me where you were when you heard about the tragedy?A: Driving back to Colorado from Tennessee after more than two months away. I was crossing Kansas through a strong snowstorm when I got a message from my friend in Boulder about an active shooting at the King Soopers.Q: In the moments, and even days, that followed, what did you see around you? A: There was shock, everywhere. The conversations were about the people we knew who had died, or who so and so knew. Boulder is not that big. The stories. The learning of the details. For days, groups of people inside moving cars were carrying bouquets of flowers. You knew where they were going.Q: So, how did you come into this project?A: In early June 2021, the organic tribute that had grown all around the supermarket’s site was going to be dismantled. While some things were going to the victims’ families, and others to the Museum of Boulder, there was a lot more left. Matt Chasansky from the office of Arts and Culture saw an opportunity and sent an email to artists inviting us to do something with what was left. I initially said, “Thank you, but no,” because I had no idea how I could contribute anything to it with the way I do work as an artist. Then Matt sent me a personal email asking to reconsider, how he had me in mind when designing the invitation. So, I went (to the site) — my first time there — and I was so moved, I cried.Q: Can you tell us about the impromptu memorial.A: The site was surrounded by a chain-link fence set up by the police, going all around the King Soopers parking lot. The fence — two blocks long on its longest side — was completely covered with handwritten signs, letters, stuffed animals, dead flowers, plastic flowers of all kinds, mementos, candles, photos.Q: Here, we need a little logistical help. How did the city actually collect and deliver the objects?A: June 7 was the day of the dismantling of the site. It was raining hard. There were many volunteers helping. I went and filled the back of my car (approximately 60 cubic feet of space) to the rim with bags of dead flowers. I didn’t want to take all of them as I didn’t know if others wanted them, too. A couple of days later, Matt let me know he had saved for me dozens more bags of dead flowers; they were waiting in an empty office next to his. I went and filled my car again two more times. I think there were still more flowers left. I brought everything to my backyard in Niwot.Q: Now, the art. You are this with the material. What did you want to accomplish?A: A transformation. I wanted to take what was left for dead and make the process of life visible and tangible. I wanted to take the sorrow and give it a voice, tell people that it mattered, that they mattered. I had felt the pain and the tenderness of the people in that impromptu memorial, the powerlessness, and their need to accompany those suffering the worst, and each other.Q: At what point did you think, “I will make this into compost?”Ana Maria Hernando distributed her piece in small brown bags accompanied by wildflower seeds. (Daniel Tseng, Special to The Denver Post)A: That one day while walking the site is when I decided I was going to make this piece. It became so clear: I was going to take the dead flowers and compost them, and make that available to the community in its potential and renewed self.You need to know that I am the worst gardener. I knew nothing about compost when I began. I found several compost bins on Craigslist and Amazon. Friends and neighbors helped.At the beginning, when things were very pokey in the piles, I was using gloves. But as soon as some softness began to round the hard edges, there was a deep pleasure connecting to the earth in that way, and I felt it being nourished and infused with life and hope. There is still compost left for future use.Q: Tell us about the process of composting. It feels like a metaphor for something. I don’t know, the processing of grief?A: Compost is a community of millions, working together with one purpose: life. It’s a process of acceptance, diversity and unity; nothing in it is lost and nothing is still about it. All is continuously transforming: The earth eats the heaviness of death and makes it into lightness. It comes up into the air as life, as flowers.Q: Can you say something about the connection between humans and flowers.A: I believe flowers are the most exquisite expression of the earth. As humans, we have used them for centuries to say what words cannot convey. We give them as gifts and to generously be present with each other. Flowers have played a prominent role in the artistic career of Ana María Hernando. This installation, “We Have Flowers,” was exhibited in 2016 at the University of Boulder Art Museum and was made from pins, thread, organza, silk and cotton embroidered by her partners in the piece, the Carmelite nuns of the Monastery of Santa Teresa de Jesus in Buenos Aires. (Jeff Wells, provided by University of Boulder Art Museum)Q: So you create this memorial package of compost and seeds, and what do you envision people doing with them?A: The packages are an offering, a wish for people to feel agency in the transformation, and empowered in the possibility of helping life to grow. It is an invitation to feel intrinsically and intimately part of the bond of community.I imagine people will plant the seeds in their gardens or a pot and feed them with the compost. Maybe there is a moment of sacredness in doing so? I hope people feel completely free to do what feels good and honest.Q: Was distributing the packages on the second anniversary of the shooting the plan from the beginning? (Right now, the compost and seed packets are only being given to victims, friends and family; the rest are being saved for a future memorial.)A: No. When I envisioned the piece, I knew I wanted to have some of the compost distributed for the victims’ families, and in the community as individual plants. The rest was to be available to use for some permanent memorial. I got the support of Matt and from Mandy Vink from Boulder Arts and Culture. Cortney Stell, from Black Cube Nomadic Museum, got interested in the piece when she learned about it at the end of 2021. Although we applied for several grants, nothing was coming forward. The whole thing felt stuck. I kept going to my backyard to turn the compost over.When Matt Chasansky asked in a meeting in February 2023 if I would be interested in presenting a version of it for the second anniversary, even though a permanent memorial might not happen for years, if at all, I realized I needed to do some version. It was beginning to feel heavy for me. I am happy I did.Q: Can you talk about art, and about artists, and about the role they play at moments like this?A: This is what I wrote in the letter that accompanied the packages:“For me, art is a verb, it’s active. Art elevates all that we are, offers us a way to transcend, to question, to be awake. It transforms us and blurs the edges of our preconceptions, it expands possibilities. Art fills us with beauty. In this instance of an immense tragedy, my wish is to use my art practice to support our collective grieving and to instill some hope for regeneration and transformation.”Q: Finally, I'}]"

e-Edition Trending: On a sunny day in late September, Todd Olander was out in the fields of a 90-acre farm in Berthoud planting rows of barley.Typically, Olander would let the soil rest through the winter months, but in recent years he’s begun experimenting with new varieties of barley that have been specifically adapted to withstand cold temperatures. Growing in the winter means the crops will absorb precipitation through the spring, a vital advantage as weather in the Western U.S. continues to get hotter and drier.As the proprietor of both Olander Farms and Root Shoot Malting, which supplies Colorado breweries and spirit makers with locally grown and malted grains, Olander has to innovate to sustain his family’s 97-year-old farm. About five years ago, he began taking proactive steps to prepare for what he expects to be the next big challenge: the water crisis.That looming threat was enough to begin cultivating the winter-friendly Lightning, Thunder and Buck barley without yet having customers for them.Farmer Todd Olander and his team planted 20 acres of Lightning barley, a winter grain adapted to endure cold temperatures and soak up precipitation through the spring. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)“I can see the writing on the wall just with everything going on with water in Colorado. There’s a possibility of a reduction in our allotment and also the possibility of not having runoff we typically see from snowpack,” Olander said. “That’s why I’m trying to be ahead of the game.”As the Colorado River continues to dry, local barley growers and maltsters are seeking out creative solutions to sustain their businesses in the face of climate change. Some are embracing nontraditional and drought-resistant grains while others are investing in technology to become more efficient. Their innovations aim to reduce water usage and bring the supply chain for craft beer and spirits closer to home, in hopes of ultimately building a resilient ecosystem that supports farmers, brewers and distillers in Colorado.In 2022, local farmers grew 4,440,000 bushels of barley, the sixth most in the nation, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. A large portion of that is purchased by Coors Brewing, which contracts with around 800 growers in the Western states and Canada, according to the company’s website.But Colorado is also home to several craft malthouses that kiln and roast barley for smaller brewers and distillers to use in making beer and liquor. Still, buying local has yet to become the norm since craft malt usually fetches a premium price. Brewer Eric Larkin has been working with Troubadour Maltings in Fort Collins to procure custom malts since he opened Cohesion Brewing Co. in Denver two years ago. It’s not the cheapest option, but it works because the brewery specializes in specialty Czech-style lagers.Larkin’s other options would be to import malt from Europe or use European-style malts grown in the U.S. While sourcing local might present unique challenges, the benefits of keeping his dollars in the local economy outweigh any potential downfalls, Larkin said.“Every crop I get from Troubadour, the malt changes and I have to make adjustments in the brewhouse,” he said, acknowledging it’s easier for a small operation that focuses on a limited portfolio of styles to do that. “Keeping your dollars with local and small producers, the impact it can have really multiplies. It stays a little closer to home. That idea has always been really valuable to me from an economic standpoint and environmental standpoint.”Todd Olander began innovating with farming practices, such as no-till farming and winter cover crops, five years ago in an effort to sustain his family farm through climate change. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)Spreading the gospel of local grainThe nonprofit Colorado Grain Chain aims to spread that ethos more widely with a variety of projects that connect local producers and makers, and incentivize collaboration. For example, the organization is currently building a digital marketplace where farmers can connect with companies or entrepreneurs seeking to purchase locally-grown grains.Project manager Lisa Boldt, who also co-owns Primitive Beer in Longmont, sees a unique opportunity to amplify the Grain Chain’s message in the beverage space. That’s why the organization recently offered $4,000 “microgrants” to brewers and distillers who used novel grains in a new product.Cohesion and WeldWerks Brewing Co. in Greeley received one grant to team up on a special release, Foamies Czech-style pale lager, using custom malts from Troubadour. The beer debuted in August and a second batch is due for release in November.WildEdge Brewing Collective in Cortez earned a grant to experiment with a Munich wheat from Root Shoot Malting, with which it created a Dunkelweizen-inspired beer called From the Fields. Steamboat Springs’ Routt Distillery, another grant recipient, leveraged a trial batch of barley grown in Montrose by Proximity Malts for its new West Slope Sarvis Gin, which also features locally foraged sarvisberries.Brendon Rockey checks quinoa at Rockey Farms in Center, Colorado. The area is ripe for growing quinoa because the climate is similar to the grain’s native environment in the Andean region of South America. (Hyoung Chang, The Denver Post)Perhaps the most intriguing microgrant project came from Dune Valley Distillery in Mosca, which will release a vodka made from quinoa in January. The distillery, which opened this summer in the historic Mosca Community Hall and Gymnasium, shares a campus with a local food hub and a potato and quinoa processing plant. It specializes in making potato vodka specifically because of the resources at its disposal, said managing partner Nicholas Chambers.“The local food approach is that you learn to consume what’s grown right near you,” Chambers said. “We are at literally the center of North American quinoa right here. It’s such a good crop for us because of low water use and it fits with our valley.”Reducing water usageOne underutilized opportunity Audrey Paugh, marketing and networking specialist at the Grain Chain, sees for beverages is in millet. Colorado is the country’s top producer of proso millet, a gluten-free and drought-tolerant ancient grain. The state is also home to Grouse Malt House, one of the few U.S. maltsters dedicated to gluten-free grains.Twila Soles founded the company with her late partner in 2013 after years of having celiac disease and being dissatisfied with gluten-free beer options. Malting even gluten-free grains requires a lot of water. Recently, Soles upgraded her system to include a steep tank that uses up to 40% less water than her original equipment.Soles sources most of her grains within 200 miles of the malting facility in Wellington and has seen her producers weather unpredictable and sometimes devastating growing seasons.“Using a crop (such as millet) that takes less water to thrive is important now and will be even more important as climate change continues to impact weather patterns,” said Soles, whose biggest Colorado client is the gluten-free Holidaily Brewing Co. “I’m hopeful that the use of more drought-tolerant crops for craft beer grows.”Grouse Malting Company founder, owner and maltstress Twila Soles breaks up clumps from malt rootlets in the germination room at Grouse Malt House in Wellington, Colorado.

Strode was first elected to Rifle City Council in 2017. “I believe I have the capabilities to go above and beyond the responsibilities in a positive way,” Strode said. “I would strive to do my best to represent the council, the staff and the city.” Councilor Alicia Gresley made the motion to put Strode in the mayoral position and new Councilor Karen Roberts seconded. Council passed the motion and Strode switched into the mayor’s middle seat. Strode’s first action as mayor was to name a mayor pro tem. “I would like to offer the position to Councilor Chris Bornholdt as the mayor pro tem for his leadership skills in the county and his long work with the Parks and Rec advisory board and representing the city,” he said. Bornholdt accepted the pro tem position. Strode thanked the council for their support and promised to do his best in his new position.

Police have not identified the suspect, who is 17, and as of Wednesday afternoon, officials had not identified the victim, an adult male. The man was found dead inside a home in the 700 block of Junction Avenue by police who responded to a medical emergency call from the residence at about 10 p.m. Monday. Officers quickly learned that a juvenile could be involved and that he had left on foot before police arrived, Deputy Chief Matt Smith said. “It was apparent during the early stages of this case that the incident was isolated to one residence and family and there was no indication the general public was in danger,” he said in an email. The youth voluntarily turned himself in at the police station at 3:30 p.m. Dec. 19. After an interview, and based on statements and evidence that allegedly supported his involvement in the death, he was detained on suspicion of first-degree murder. Smith did not provide a cause of death. “We are still in the process of analyzing some of the evidence collected at the scene, and autopsy reports are pending for the deceased adult male, so we are not releasing information specific to those topics at this time,” his email stated. “The Montrose Police Department recognizes that incidents like these are extremely disturbing for everyone to hear about. This is a tragedy for the family members of the victim and suspect. As always, we are committed to providing the highest level of public safety service to our community. This was especially true during this case, as our officers’ and detectives’ quick work and tireless efforts brought such a serious case to a quick but thorough resolution.” Katharhynn Heidelberg is the Montrose Daily Press assistant editor and senior writer.

Newsletters and Alerts Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts Trending: Running into Rick Sallinger on the job could have been the best or worst day of your life.The 73-year-old television journalist, who’s stepping down this month after more than three decades on Denver’s airwaves, could change lives for the better by spotlighting underdogs and working-class issues. He used the power of broadcast to raise money and resources for good causes. He never ambushed anyone who didn’t deserve it, colleagues said. And woe to those who did.KCNC-TV journalist Rick Sallinger, left, and son Marc clear snow in March 2022. Marc has followed in Rick’s footsteps as a TV news reporter, this time working at 9News. (Provided by Rick Sallinger)“He would put in the time and discipline to make sure anybody impacted (by a story) would get a chance to comment early on,” said Walt DeHaven, who retired in 2021 as general manager of KCNC-TV, the CBS affiliate also known as CBS News Colorado.“But he could be equally as dogged in making sure he got you on the record,” DeHaven added. “He was one of the first people that dropped into my office when I got to KCNC in 2001, and he basically said in the most diplomatic way possible, ‘I’m Rick Sallinger, this is what I do, and you’re not going to get in the way of that, are you?’ ”Sallinger said earlier this month he was retiring due to undisclosed health reasons that are being covered by disability insurance. The Chicago native and Peabody Award-winning journalist spoke to The Denver Post in a wide-ranging interview about his global career, biggest stories and unique perspective on the Mile High City’s boom-and-bust evolution. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.Q: Your son Marc penned a tribute to you on 9News with a picture of him as a child “anchoring” a broadcast. Did you make that little desk for him?A: That was in our basement. He was sitting in a chair and I had an old News4 sign they had left me. So I put masking tape on the back and put it on the wall, and gave him some headlines to read. As he was reading the sign fell off the wall and hit him on the head. And now all these years later he’s a reporter and anchor for Channel 9.Q: That’s about as good a metaphor for journalism as I’ve heard. A: I know a father-daughter duo at Channel 7, Tony Kovaleski and his daughter Jennifer. But it’s funny when I show up at a story and see my son there competing with me. We don’t carpool, and we’ve got to draw a line about work — what we can talk about, and what we can’t.Q: How has the response to your retirement been in the industry?A: It’s been overwhelming, the amount of calls texts, emails, and posts that I’ve gotten since I announced it (earlier this month). We had a goodbye party at CBS News Colorado the other day and one by one, people got up to say things very kind about me. And I said to myself, “Who is this person they’re talking about? Is this really me?” What I learned, to be honest, is that some people have a higher opinion and respect for me than I give myself.Q: That must be a strange feeling.A: Yes, it is. It’s kind of like attending your own funeral while you’re still alive, and I think that’s a good thing. You get to hear all these nice things that people say about you while you can still hear them.Rick Sallinger is retiring from a broadcast career that includes 30 years at KCNC-TV CBS News Colorado. (Provided by Rick Sallinger)Q: TV news, radio and other legacy media, as it’s called, has lost its command of local news in recent years. How do you feel about the future of the industry?A: I was grateful I was in television, which wasn’t hit as hard as print, and I think there’s always going to be a need for local news. While television isn’t making the money that it used to — there are now so many sources for news and programming — TV news is still vital.Q: What have you learned about human nature as a reporter, both in the U.S. and when you worked as a CNN correspondent in the London bureau in the 1990s?A: Too often we have to deal with those who have suffered sudden and great losses, such as we’ve seen in so many cases including the Columbine mass shooting, the Aurora theater shooting, and the Boulder King Soopers shooting. Those are just some of the largest ones. And those stories are some of the most difficult and painful because of the number of victims. It’s the hardest part of the job to approach family members of those who have lost loved ones, so what I’ve learned is to be respectful and take a “no” for an answer — which is the opposite of when I’m doing investigations.Q: How has Denver changed since you first came here in 1980?A: First I worked at Channel 9 for about six years, and Denver was obviously smaller then. It seemed like when they built C-470 it was on the edge of the world. I remember I-25 expanding and the traffic not getting any better. When I left in 1986 to go back to Chicago, Denver was in a down period because the oil and gas economy was in a rut. When I came back at the very end of 1993 (to work for KCNC-TV), it was on an upward swing and home prices had skyrocketed from when I had left.Q: That sure sounds familiar.A: Denver has become quite an unaffordable place for a lot of people now. I’m very saddened to see the tent encampments that are throughout the area, particularly around downtown. And I don’t see that in every city I’ve been, so there’s got to be a way to help these people and get rid of that problem. I think Mayor Johnston is trying to do that but it’s a difficult problem to solve. I’m also saddened to see after the pandemic how downtown has become more vacant. I hope they can return some of its glory.Denver TV news journalist Rick Sallinger on a story for KCNC-TV The CBS News Colorado. (Provided by Rick Sallinger)Q: You’ve covered a lot of heartbreaking stories, but what’s one that showed the best of Denver?A: I had worked in Indianapolis prior to getting the job at Channel 9 (in 1980), and had a month off between jobs. I said, “What can I do for a month?” and I saw PanAm advertising a trip around the world for $1,111. So I went. And I was in India on a bus and the woman next to me happened to be from Evergreen. I told her that I was coming to work in Denver and she said, “Where are you going next?” I said Bangkok, and she said, “You ought to do a story about a friend of mine, a nurse, in a Cambodian refugee camp.” So I went to the Cambodian border, hired a photographer, and found her friend.She just casually mentioned that what refugees really need are shoes, so I went back to Denver and put this story on the air. All of a sudden this giant, grassroots drive sprouted up. It started with a store in Glenwood Springs that said “we’ll donate shoes,” and all these other places jumped in. We collected 5,000 pairs and with the help of the International Rescue Committee, we were able to fly them over to Thailand and deliver them. That showed the hearts of the people of Colorado.Related Articles TV Streaming | Grading The Week: Shaquille O’Neal’s Nikola Jokic rant made NBA, TNT, Warner Bros.

Both congressional districts are sprawling rural areas that otherwise have little in common. The 3rd District is home to Colorado’s famed wine and fruit country, but also contains most of the state’s posh ski resorts and other tourist attractions. The eastern plains are almost entirely agricultural. While the 4th District has a higher ratio of registered Republicans to Democrats than the 3rd, and thus is seen as more conservative, the population prides itself on its agrarian common sense.

The cyanide devices, known as M-44 traps, are activated by driving a small pipe into the ground which contains a spring-loaded ejector and a sodium cyanide capsule. The top of the trap is baited with a scented substance to attract animals, and when the animal pulls on the material, a cloud of cyanide powder is shot into the air surrounding the device. M-44 traps were, for years, used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s secretive Wildlife Services agency to kill coyotes in an effort to protect livestock on public lands. But M-44 traps have drawn a firestorm of controversy for the collateral damage they’ve inflicted on the public, killing family pets and even being connected to the death of humans. In 2003, Utah resident Dennis Slaugh was on U.S. Bureau of Land Management land near the Colorado border when he touched a loaded M-44 and was sprayed with cyanide. He suffered high blood pressure, difficulty breathing, daily vomiting, and an inability to work as a Caterpillar D8 driver “because he is too weak to climb up into the machine’s rungs,” the Salt Lake Tribune reported in 2008. Slaugh died in 2018; his death certificate indicates that cyanide poisoning from an M-44 contributed to his death. In 2007 and 2008, petitions were circulated calling for the Environmental Protection Agency to suspend the use of sodium cyanide and sodium fluoroacetate, otherwise known as Compound 1080, another chemical compound used to kill predators. Compound 1080 has been banned in Colorado since 1972, but is still in use in other states and is occasionally found to be still in use in Colorado, as well. In 2001, approximately 30 dogs and cats and 35 birds were poisoned by 1080 in Grand Junction, and in 2009, a wolf that had traveled into Eagle County from Yellowstone National Park was killed by Compound 1080 in Rio Blanco County. In 2017, Wildlife Services in Colorado agreed to temporarily halt the use of sodium cyanide following a lawsuit from WildEarth Guardians and the Center for Biological Diversity which challenged a Colorado Parks and Wildlife plan to kill cougars and bears “in a scientifically unsupported attempt to boost mule deer populations,” according to the Center for Biological Diversity. But a few years later, Wildlife Services began using M-44 traps once again, killing nine coyotes with the devices in Colorado in 2022. The Center for Biological Diversity circulated a petition in June, asking the BLM to ban the use of M-44 traps. “Because it’s federal public land, (the BLM) can decide what uses to allow on this federal land, and what uses to ban, and this went all the way up to the director of the BLM, and they agreed to not allow Wildlife Services to place these anymore,” said Collette Adkins, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity’s carnivore conservation program. “So they can still shoot coyotes, or use traps, for example, but they can’t use these cyanide devices, which are particularly indiscriminate and cruel, as far as we’re concerned.” Adkins said the most high-profile incident regarding an M-44 trap involved a 14-year-old Idaho resident Canyon Mansfield, who was less than a football field’s length from his home when he encountered an M-44 and triggered it, thinking it was a sprinkler head. The device spewed toxic orange cyanide powder that killed his dog in front of him and left him injured, as well, giving him severe headaches and moments where he couldn’t feel his arm. “The United States government put a cyanide bomb 350 feet from my house, and killed my dog and poisoned my child,” Theresa Mansfield, Canyon’s mother, told the Guardian newspaper in 2020. Adkins said Canyon was likely spared due to the wind direction at the time. “That was on BLM land right behind his house,” she said. Adkins applauds the BLM for the decision to ban the devices, saying it’s a positive step toward completely eliminating M-44 traps. “This is such a big deal because the BLM administers so much land across the West,” Adkins said. “I think it’s probably a sign that even the people that are policing these are sick of the danger and they’re sick of the bad press. I think these are on their way out.” May 22, 2024 May 22, 2024 May 21, 2024 May 21, 2024 May 20, 2024 May 20, 2024 May 18, 2024 May 19, 2024 May 20, 2024 May 18, 2024 Readers around Craig and Moffat County make the Craig Press’ work possible.

(Knobbe) brothers Dave, at left, and Bill, are shown with a photo of their father, and engraved plane wreckage gifted to them by Loren and Colette Jessen. — Shari Friedel | High Plains News North A photo taken by then-land owner George Steudler shows the cleanup effort by Air National Guard. — Shari Friedel | High Plains News North Engraving is visible on one end of the wrecked airplane part found in Perkins County, Nebraska. — Shari Friedel | High Plains News North Bill Knobbe of Denver was in the middle of his customary afternoon nap one day in early May, when his phone rang. Although the number was unfamiliar, he decided to answer. The conversation that followed led Bill and his siblings on a journey of discovery, and remembrance of their father, Major William Hodgson, who was a U.S. Marine Corps pilot when they were a young family in the 1940s and 50s. The caller was Colette Jessen of rural Grant. She quickly cut to the purpose of the call...to find out if Bill could possibly be the son of the major. As it turns out, he is. This confirmation led to many more conversations between Colette and the Hodgson, now Knobbe family, and an eventual meeting in Perkins County. Unusual find In 2012, Colette and her husband Loren had purchased land near Elsie, and while working a field, unearthed a partially exposed, approximately three-foot long, heavy, metal object. Inspecting it closely, they discovered an engraving on one end, that read, “Major William Hodgson, crashed with F80 jet, Feb. 26, 1958.” Mystified, Colette and Loren tried on-and-off for the next several years to locate the next of kin of the pilot, based only on the name, with no success. Recently, the Jessens enlisted the help of Stephanie Larson of the Veteran Service Office in Grant, who put the information out to a social media group that attempts to locate the lost. Hearing of the request to find the family, another group follower took on the task, and amazingly, was able to supply identities, papers and contact information of nearly everyone in the Hodgson family. Colette immediately reached out to Bill, now 71, the second oldest of Major Hodgson’s five children, who was six at the time of the plane crash. Other siblings are Cheryl, 11 at the time, Michael, who was five, David, three at the time, and three-month-old Stephen. The name discrepancy is the result of Mrs. Hodgson (Mary) remarrying later, and the children being adopted by her new husband. Once they connected, it was a “whirlwind of excitement for the Hodgsons, us, and local veteran personnel,” said Colette. The Jessens and Knobbes (formerly Hodgsons) believe that following the crash, an investigation was conducted, the wreckage collected and transported out of the area, and someone, whose identity remained a mystery until recently, engraved a part of the plane and left it at the site as a memorial to the young pilot who unfortunately lost his life there. The artifact had been partially buried in a hollow, presumably made by the impact of the plane decades ago, until the Jessens uncovered it. The Hodgson children knew that their father had died in a plane crash, but details and memories were sketchy, since they were so young at the time. Major Hodgson had been flying for United Airlines and was a member of the Colorado Air National Guard. On that fateful day in 1958, he was on a cross-country navigational training flight from Denver to Rome, New York, expected to refuel in Minneapolis-St. Paul, when he crashed in western Nebraska. Black smoke reportedly had been pouring from the tail section moments before impact. The major’s young children had to rely on family stories told and retold over the years to sustain the memory of their father. A well-loved and handsome, fun guy, said Bill, Major Hodgson’s death deeply affected his family and friends. Bill said that his dad was an ace pilot, having learned to fly even before he could drive, and was on a short list of possible candidates for future space explorations. Locals remember crash The land where the crash occurred belonged to George Steudler of Paxton at the time. His daughter, Phyllis Peak, who still lives in Paxton, remembers that she was teaching school that day, which she described as foggy and cloudy. Her dad was in his garage when he heard a terrible noise and what sounded like an explosion. He went out to investigate, and when he realized what had happened, called for help. By this time a small crowd had gathered and emergency personnel from Paxton arrived shortly thereafter. “Dad felt terrible,” Phyllis said. Out of respect for the downed pilot, he stayed at the site in a camper until all of the wreckage was removed by Air National Guard personnel. It was he who made the engraving and left the piece at the site. Pat Pelster of Paxton was almost eight years old when the crash occurred. A memory that has remained with him is being at the barbershop at Elsie and someone showing him a 50 cent coin found at the crash site, that had been nearly torn in half. He remembers exploring the site with his dad after the large pieces had been removed. In a related story, the Hodgson family kept a quarter, bent in half, that had been in Major Hodgson’s pocket during the crash, until Dave, not realizing its significance, spent it on a candy bar as a child. A visit and gift At the invitation of the Jessens, Bill and Dave traveled to Perkins County from Denver on Memorial Day weekend, attending the Memorial Day program at Fairview Cemetery in Grant and seeing other area sites. “I’m glad we went,” said Bill “We had a wonderful time.” “The research that has been done on our behalf is just amazing,” Dave said. The Jessens feel that Major Hodgson’s children are the rightful owners of the engraved wreckage, and presented it to the Knobbes, who gratefully accepted the gift. The former land owners are pleased that the memorial now resides with the pilot’s family. The brothers still have questions, and a renewed desire to gain more knowledge of the crash that claimed their father’s life. Dave has reached out to Buckley Field near Denver, the origin of the flight, with hopes to obtain an accident report. Included in their stay in Perkins County was a visit to the approximate site of the crash. The two brothers were moved by the peacefulness, the setting sun and birdsong that surrounded them. “I felt good about that,” said Dave. “After spending time in southwest Nebraska, I can see the appeal.” Click here to read Holyoke Enterprise 970-854-2811 (Phone) 130 N Interocean Ave PO Box 297 Holyoke CO 80734'}]"

AI language models like ChatGPT, with over 100 million users, are revolutionizing the way we communicate and access information. AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks that typically require human intellect. This includes learning from experience, understanding language, and making decisions. AI is not just a single technology but a blend of various technologies and algorithms. These models (especially the Large Language models like ChatGPT) currently don’t reason but instead work by detecting patterns in preexisting human generated materials that they are trained on. Josiah Seaman, Founder of Creative Contours, describes AI as a “multiplier for human creativity and a vessel for human skill.” Image created with AI (by Monika Lea Jonesand Bo Maxwell Stevens, AI Fusion Insights) AI’s ubiquity is undeniable. It’s integrated into our daily lives, from YouTube recommendations to Spotify’s music suggestions. Spotify even introduced an AI DJ, “X,” that personalizes music based on your preferences and listening history. AI is expected to become even more advanced and integrated into our lives in the coming months and years. Nikhil Krishnaswamy, a computer science professor at CSU, emphasizes the importance of everyone having input in AI’s deployment. He believes that AI should be used “to the maximum benefit of everyone, not just those who already have power and resources.” He also emphasizes that humans should remain the final decision-makers in situations requiring value judgments and situational understanding. Image created with AI (by Monika Lea Jonesand Bo Maxwell Stevens, AI Fusion Insights) AI’s future promises more personalized experiences, improved data analysis, and possibly new forms of communication. However, ethical considerations are crucial. Krishnaswamy and Seaman agree that AI should eliminate undesirable tasks, not jobs. Seaman’s vision of the future of AI is similar to that of Star Trek, where AI disrupts our current system of capitalism, currency, and ownership, but people can strive for loftier goals. The impact of AI on jobs is a topic of debate. Dan Murray, founder of the Rocky Mountain AI Interest Group, suggests that while some “jobs will be lost, new ones will be created”. Murray has heard it said that “you won’t be replaced by AI but you might be replaced by someone who uses AI.” Seaman believes AI can improve quality of life by increasing productivity, potentially reducing the need for work. This aligns with the concept of Universal Basic Income, a topic of interest for organizations like OpenAI.

Its potential is boundless, but it must be embraced responsibly. As we integrate AI into our lives, we must consider ethical implications. There are issues that AI can perpetuate such as: surveillance, amplifying human biases, and widening inequality. Currently AI is a tool. Just like a match, which can light a campfire or burn down a forest, the same tool could be used for both benefit and harm. The future of AI is exciting, and we’re all part of its journey. As we experience the dawn of AI, we should consider how it can improve efficiency, creativity, and innovation in our lives.

Lauren Boebert, who currently represents Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, will run for the same position but in the 4th Congressional District, her 2022 general election challenger, Adam Frisch, a Democrat from Aspen, says he was as surprised as anyone. Frisch a self proclaimed conservative Democrat stated that prior to Boebert’s actions at the Buell Theater in Denver, in which Boebert and a date appeared to be groping each other and Boebert also appeared to be vaping, polls showed Frisch to be leading Boebert by 2% in their bid for the congressional seat. He believes the incident hurt Boebert in her bid for reelection. And she was already in tough territory — after redistricting occurred in 2022, Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District was projected to be at a 9% advantage for the Republican candidate, up from 6% prior, but Frisch lost by a mere 546 votes in 2022’s general election. No one took him seriously until election night, Frisch claimed in an interview with the Montrose Daily Press/Delta County Independent on Thursday. Frisch stated he was on the road 25 days out of each month during the campaign and got the sense that the constituents were tired of the far right and far left’s rhetoric politics. He labeled that branch of the political scene as ‘angertainment,’ in which he says Boebert is a key fixture. Is Frisch happy that Boebert is running in a different district? The short answer is yes but not for competitive reasons. He feels now the remaining candidates can focus on local issues that affect residents of the district. He views those issues as energy production and consumption, western and southern Colorado water conservation and jobs. While Frisch wants to focus on local issues and not the national issues that dominate the political coverage he understands that there are issues that need to be addressed. “The border is a disaster.” Frisch said. “When people from China, eastern European countries and others are flying in to cross our border it’s a problem.” When Hamas invaded Israel on Oct 7 of this year. Frisch, a Jewish American, said it affected him personally. His daughter spent most of the summer in Israel at a church camp. Some of her camp counselors were at the music festival where many Jews were injured, kidnapped and killed. His son worked for the Israeli Ambassador in Washington D.C. When he hears the slogan ‘from the river to the sea’ chanted by far left members of his party, he believes they are wanting to eradicate all Jews. He said he sees the results of his campaign against Boebert and her leaving the district as a wake up call to the far wings of both parties — the majority of voters from either party don’t have an appetite for extremist positions, he said. As far as the district, Frisch says he hasn’t faced discrimination because of his faith. His biggest hurdle is being from a resort town, but believes after conversations with voters while on the campaign trail that most see him as a moderate with rural values. “For most of the past thirty to forty years a moderate has held this seat, including John Salazar, a Democrat and Scott Tipton, a Republican. Being on team red or team blue isn’t as important as representing rural values,” he said. As an example, Frisch notes the recent release of wolves in Western Colorado as a flawed policy of Colorado Democrats and vows to be bipartisan to achieve the results 3rd District voters are looking for moving forward. While it seems early on in the aftermath of Boebert’s announcement to assume Jeff Hurd from Grand Junction is the Republican front runner, the candidate was already attracting attention, but Frisch believes that more Republicans will enter the race. Asked if he has had any conversations with Hurd, Frisch stated that he and Hurd had connected prior to Hurd's entry into the race and after. Primarily the conversation has focused on campaign life as a husband and a father and not much else. According to Frisch both have been focused on their own campaigns. Frisch believes that a lot of dark money will leave the campaign now that Boerbert is exiting the district. Frisch states that he has raised more that $7.5 million dollars mostly from in-district and in-state donors more than Boebert was able to raise.. He also states that there will be less money raised off the backs of hard working Western Colorado voters and businesses because the race will have less of a national focus. Frisch credits his time last year pounding his body traveling the district to reach the voters for his success so far. “This guy from Pitkin County connected with the voters which surprised people,” Frisch said. “I ran a non-egotistical campaign. Everyone seemed to blow me off until election night. Now my opponent is taking her campaign and carpetbagging to eastern Colorado.” Dennis Anderson is the publisher of the Montrose Daily Press and Delta County Independent.

She said she had also heard from Hispanic families at the complex that white families were getting their maintenance issues first, sometimes a month or two ahead of Hispanic families that filed similar work tickets. Some Hispanic families even resorted to fixing their own dishwashers and showers because of it, Espino added. Some households, like Espino’s, lived without hot water for a week or more last winter, she said. Those testimonies hit home for Espino, who told Denver VOICE that part of the issue was that Trion didn’t have someone in the front office who spoke Spanish. “I couldn’t believe that some people were living like that and the apartment managers weren’t doing anything to fix it,” Espino said. So, the Edge26 tenants started organizing a union with the help of Edgewater Collective, a local non-profit organization. They showed up to city council meetings and told the community about their living conditions. At first, Espino said a lot of people showed up, and that seemed to push Trion to hire an employee who spoke Spanish. But then attendance at the tenant meetings started to dwindle. Espino said she suspected people stopped coming because the union couldn’t address the community’s main concern—rent increases. “We are here to help, but there are some things that we just can’t address. And unfortunately, rent is one of them,” Espino said. Espino’s situation at Edge26 is similar to the experiences that many tenants in Denver face as the city’s multifamily market continues to soar. Commercial real estate firm Marcus and Millchap’s Q2 2023 Denver Multifamily Market Report found that the city’s 90% rent payment fulfillment rate and high average yields continue to draw out-of-state investors to the market. Out-of-state investors accounted for nearly half of all transactions over the last 12 months and that investment activity is one reason why the city’s average rent has increased by more than 28% since March 2020 up to nearly $2,000 per month, according to the report. Trion Properties is just one company that sees huge profit potential in the Denver metro area’s multifamily market. Since 2020, Trion has acquired properties such as The View at North Peak Apartments, a 288-unit community in Northglenn, for $38 million; the 402-unit Terra Village in Edgewater (which was later rebranded as Edge26) for $109million, and a 198-unit complex in Aurora called Trailpoint on Highline for about $28 million. Trion also offers its more than 1,200 investors an average internal return rate of 18% over the 18-plus years that the company has been operating, according to its website. Denver VOICE reached out to Trion Properties for comment about the allegations made against the company but did not receive a reply before press time. Some tenants also say that the staggering rent increases some landlords are instituting are putting them at risk of losing their homes. Denver led the nation with a 71% gap between local median rents and household income between 2009 and 2021, according to a recent study by Witch, a subsidiary of the real estate platform Clever. In turn, tenants across the Denver metro area have formed unions to try and slow rent increases and provide better living conditions for renters. Although many of the issues these unions are trying to address exist at the individual building level, some union organizers say the organizations are driven by the same issues. Namely, that local lawmakers seem eager to engage tenants about the issues they face but don’t show the same enthusiasm when it comes time to passing legislation that could stop the issues from happening in the first place. “There seems to be a lack of awareness from the people in power, who are oftentimes not renters themselves,” Shannon Hoffman, a member of Denver’s Democratic Socialist party and former city council candidate, told Denver VOICE in an interview. “They’re not in close proximity to the people who are facing eviction or who are unable to pay rent, and that precludes them from being able to see the human side of the issue and making the link between a lack of affordable housing and the increasing rates of homelessness that we’re seeing.” ROOTS THAT RUN DEEP The roots of the frustrations some Denver renters feel predate the coronavirus pandemic, but the event seemingly served to exacerbate their concerns. Rents followed the demand for non-congregate shelter upwards at a startling pace. At the same time, low-wage workers like cooks, housekeepers, and cashiers were “disproportionately displaced” from the labor market at the onset of the pandemic, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In turn, local governments across the metro area Instituted eviction moratoriums to prevent as many people as possible from losing their homes because of pandemic-induced job losses or work-hour reductions. They also used federal funds to dramatically expand rental assistance programs, and some counties like Denver created eviction legal defense programs for renters. Over the past three years, lawmakers in the General Assembly have also passed a wide range of progressive style bills that prohibit source of income discrimination by landlords, housing discrimination based on someone’s hair type, and gave tenants more power to address issues in their rental contracts. So why do some renters say these efforts haven’t been enough? Hoffman said one reason is that the programs that lawmakers have created are not large enough to meet the scale of need. For example, Denver has its own eviction defense program but there were still more than 1,200 evictions filed in May, which is 35% higher than the number recorded in May 2019 before the pandemic began, Denverite reported. However, Denver only spends about $1.5 million annually on its eviction program, a total that has remained stagnant over the last two years, according to city budget documents. Hoffman added that lawmakers have also failed to pass legislation that directly addresses some of the tenant organizations’ concerns like requiring just cause in an eviction case. The bill sought to limit the instances where a landlord could legally evict a tenant but was ultimately laid over before the last legislative session ended. Eighteen anti-poverty organizations including the ACLU of Colorado, Colorado Poverty Law Project, and the Colorado Village Collaborative penned a letter asking newly elected Denver Mayor Mike Johnston to implement many of the requirements of the just cause eviction bill such as ending evictions for unpaid rent and increasing funding for eviction legal defense programs. These organizations also called on Johnston to increase eviction defense funding by up to $10 million annually. “There’s a real lack of trust, and we’re starting from less than- zero on many of these issues,” Melissa Meja, the state and local policy director for the Community Economic Defense Project, a nonprofit that also signed the letter to Johnston, told Denver VOICE in an interview. Another issue that Hoffman said needs to be addressed is Colorado’s ban on rent control, which stems from the 2000 Colorado Supreme Court decision in Town of Telluride v. Lot Thirty-Four Venture, LLC, also known as the “Telluride decision.” Lawmakers introduced a bill during the 2023 legislative session that sought to repeal local rent control prohibitions, but the bill was subsequently laid over after a strong lobbying effort from groups like the Associated Builders and Contractors of the Rocky Mountains, the Colorado Apartment Association, and the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, according to the Colorado Secretary of State’s office. TAKING MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS While the disconnect between renters and lawmakers has some tenants taking matters into their own hands by organizing, it also has pitted some tenants against their landlords in the courtroom. In early June, five tenants filed a class action lawsuit against Tschetter Sulzer, P.C., a law firm in Denver that specializes in eviction cases. Each plaintiff described situations where they were charged attorneys’ fees and costs by the law firm after it represented their landlords in eviction cases against the plaintiffs for nonpayment of rent. Carol Kennedy, an attorney with the Colorado Poverty Law Project who is representing the plaintiffs, told Denver VOICE that Colorado law prohibits these fees from being assessed in cases that are settled out of court, as each of the class action plaintiffs did. The lawsuit also represents an urgent question for lawmakers about how they will enforce new laws aimed at protecting renters as debates about tenant rights spill over into the next legislative session. “This is just an effort to enforce the laws as they are currently written, and make the system work in the way that it is supposed to work,” Kennedy said. Kinsey Hasstedt, the senior state and local policy program director at Enterprise Community Fund, told Denver VOICE that she sympathizes with the frustration of renters because the past few years'}]"

From the feedback that we are hearing, this is a welcomed change in historical landscape.” “As a native of our region, I have invested in many businesses and organizations in Colorado Springs and this opportunity fit my focus on building a stronger community where a diverse range of voices are heard.” Says Co-founder of PPMC, Kevin O’Neil. “A robust media landscape telling all our stories makes our community better, so I am pleased to be in a position to support this effort for Colorado Springs and the Pikes Peak Region. We are excited to engage with our unique neighborhoods, industry, arts and culture, academia, non-profits, civic organizations, and the military to showcase what makes us one of the best places to live and work.” Yemi Mobolade, Mayor of Colorado Springs said in response to the news of the revival, “I applaud and appreciate the efforts of these local leaders to lead a resurgence of the Colorado Springs Independent and the Colorado Springs Business Journal. These publications hold a unique place in the Colorado Springs media landscape, offering a platform for diverse perspectives and contributing to the civic life of Colorado Springs. Our local news outlets serve a core public service and are critical to community building. The information shared through these outlets is vital in giving residents the information they need to improve their quality of life.” “We are excited about PPMC’s acquisition of the Colorado Springs Independent and the Colorado Springs Business Journal, creating jobs, and bringing in new energy and diverse perspectives to continue to inform and tell the Colorado Springs story,” said Johnna Reeder Kleymeyer, President & CEO of Colorado Springs Chamber & Economic Development Corporation. “Kevin O’Neil and JW Roth are visionaries that love our region and are invested in driving the growth and prosperity of the Pikes Peak region. Today’s announcement is an affirmation of their commitment to our region.” Following its hiatus, the Colorado Springs Independent and Colorado Springs Business Journal, a cornerstone of the community for three decades, is now primed for a remarkable resurgence. PPMC\'s acquisition encompasses all rights to the brands, trademarks, copyrights, and associated events of both the Colorado Springs Independent and the Colorado Springs Business Journal. About Pikes Peak Media Company: Pikes Peak Media Company (PPMC) is a dynamic media enterprise founded by Kevin O’Neil and JW Roth, dedicated to revitalizing, and enriching the media landscape in Colorado Springs.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 1:48 pm Many of you have probably seen the announcement of Chief Hayes's retirement Dec. 22. I greatly appreciate his service to our community, and that his retirement will allow him to spend more time with his family. At this time, I am working to recruit an experienced, external Interim Police Chief, on a limited-term contract basis. The Interim Chief will continue to ensure that our Police Department meets the high standards we expect for policing in our community. I will be using an external contractor rather than an internal interim, because all our existing command staff are relatively new to either their positions or the organization. The interim Chief will then provide continuity until the position of Chief is officially filled in early 2024. Unfortunately, this announcement came at a time when we are also conducting Police Department employee conduct investigations. I want to start off by stating that the timing of his retirement is entirely unrelated to these investigations we have been pursuing internally. Chief Hayes and I began discussing the possibility of his retirement well before we learned of the two incidents that resulted in me placing employees on administrative leave. Even as his retirement date approaches, the Chief is keenly focused on maintaining the Department’s high standards of public service. I am confident in his ability to continue to oversee all Police Department operations, including these investigations, through his retirement date. Post-retirement, Chief Hayes has agreed to help ensure continuity of these investigations with Town staff. At the core of our organization is integrity and transparency, any violations of policies or laws are unacceptable within the Police Department. We continue to pursue more information on our investigations into the alleged violations. I want to provide the most current releasable information. I also want to emphasize that none of the alleged violations pertain to use of force or any interaction with the public. One of these investigations pertained to the improper use of a Town vehicle while on duty. The officer involved has been disciplined appropriately and is no longer on administrative leave. However, a different officer was placed on administrative leave today, when new information regarding concerns about suspected untruthfulness came to light while investigating that same incident. We requested and appreciated the support of the Louisville Police Department and Larimer County Sheriff’s Office for overseeing and assisting with the initial investigation. We are in the process of identifying another agency to conduct the Internal Affairs investigation into the conduct of the officer who was placed on administrative leave today. In a separate incident, I placed one officer and one civilian staff member on administrative leave after the Chief received a report from another law enforcement agency alleging employee mishandling of confidential public safety records. Estes Park Police Department subsequently identified a civilian employee who may have also mishandled these records. This is an alleged violation of state law, and these individuals are now under criminal investigation. Chief Hayes promptly notified the Larimer County District Attorney’s Office, and asked the City of Loveland Police Department to conduct a criminal investigation into these allegations. When these criminal investigations are complete, the City of Evans Police Department has agreed to conduct the Internal Affairs investigation into the conduct of these two employees. At the core of our organization is integrity and transparency, and any violations of policies or laws are unacceptable within the Police Department. When we have new releasable information, we will be sharing that with our community. Both Chief Hayes and I take allegations of official misconduct seriously, and we will continue to take immediate steps to investigate and follow through as appropriate. It is important to keep in mind that the investigations are all being conducted by other law enforcement agencies at our request. Those agencies maintain the records while they conduct the investigations and are limited in what they can share.

A sign on a door shows Return to Nature’s business hours at its Elkton Drive location Friday. CAÑON CITY • In the coming months, investigators will be piecing together the identities of 115 bodies found this week in a seemingly desolate building in Penrose. The Return to Nature Funeral Home, a formerly Colorado Springs-based business, was using the modest 2,500-square-foot building, when neighbors reported a foul smell that led to an investigation this week. Police said Friday they have found at least 115 bodies at a Colorado ‘green’ funeral home under investigation for improper handling of remains. Fremont County Sheriff Allen Cooper described the ""very disturbing discovery,"" as a hazardous situation, requiring specialty clean-up and equipment. ""Our priority and our focus is on the impacted families,"" he said at a news conference in Cañon City on Friday. Cooper said officials will put up tents or fencing before clearing out the scene and identifying the bodies. Officials want to shield the property out of consideration of the families of the deceased. ""After the scene is made safe, and personal protective equipment is issued, dignified treatment of the deceased is our next priority,"" Cooper said. Reached by The Gazette early Friday afternoon, Cecilia Converse said she had no complaints about her experience with the funeral home, which handled cremation of her daughter, 41-year-old daughter Amber Nichol Haines, who died April 16. Return to Nature offered cremations and green funerals meaning the bodies are not embalmed and can be buried in a shroud or container made from natural materials. Everyone Converse spoke to and worked with was polite, Converse said, and the services prompt. Staff ""told me it would take three days after I filled out the paperwork for them to decide whether or not I was legally able to make the decision of what to do with her remains,” Converse said. “Three days later I had her remains."" Converse said she was still processing the macabre breaking news out of Penrose, and what it could mean. “All I can say is … they were very nice. It was a good experience,” she said. “Now I’m concerned whose ashes I have.” Investigators began searching the property, located off Colorado 115 in Penrose, 34 miles south of Colorado Springs, on Wednesday. Scattered businesses neighbor the building with its tall, unkept grass — almost working to hide the building in plain sight. Patrons of the post office located directly next door for the most part have paid it little attention, until the smell began wafting toward the direction of the back parking lot. A man who works on property directly behind the funeral home said he\'s never seen anyone go in or out of the building, and vehicles, a hearse and SUV, only appeared in June. The odor has been in the air for a month, he said. ""I\'d randomly smell it, but I didn\'t think anything of it. I thought it was just roadkill or something like that,"" he said. Fremont County Coroner Randy Keller said county and federal hazardous-materials officials surveyed the scene Wednesday night. It has since been declared a local disaster emergency. Michelle Watkins approached the yellow tape surrounding the property in utter dismay. ""I heard about the story, but I didn\'t realize it was here,"" Watkins said, visibly shocked. Keller described the scene as ""truly horrific"" and would not go into detail regarding how the bodies were stored, only that they were being stored improperly. Officials confirmed one Fremont County employee was treated by paramedics for injuries resulting from the hazardous conditions present inside the building. The deputy is expected to make a full recovery. On Wednesday, the Office of Funeral Home and Crematory Registration Program Director Zen Mayhugh spoke with the funeral home owner Jon Hallford after receiving reports about the smell. Hallford told the official he had a ""problem"" at the property and claimed he practiced taxidermy there, a state document said. Hallford agreed to meet later Wednesday at the building for an inspection. The document went on to say Hallford attempted to conceal the improper storage of human remains. Officials largely left the building early Friday afternoon but had returned in the early evening. The investigation, expected to take months, will involve agencies such as the FBI, El Paso County Coroner\'s Office, Douglas County Coroner\'s Office, The Colorado Bureau of Investigation, Colorado Governor\'s Office Emergency Management Team and the Department of Regulatory Agencies. Forensic fingerprint technology, dental records and DNA will be used in identifying the remains left in the building, Keller said. FBI Special Agent Mark Michalek said specialized FBI forensic units from headquarters in Quantico, Va., will assist in in identifying remains, as well. Sheriff Cooper did not speculate about arrests or potential charges. ""The owners of the funeral home have so far been cooperative with the investigation,"" Cooper said. When the business opened in 2017, it was owned by Hallford, his wife, Carie Hallford, and Jack Dhooghe, The Gazette reported. Since then, the Hallfords have struggled with financial and legal issues. Return to Nature Funeral Home has a location in Colorado Springs at 944 Elkton Drive, a portion of a large industrial building, with tenants on either side. The Colorado Springs Police Department confirmed the Elkton Drive location was searched on Thursday. ""Saw nothing out of the ordinary,"" said Travis DeWitte, who works next door to the Return to Nature location. ""Smells — that\'s something else."" DeWitte and several other neighboring business workers all reported a ""horrific"" or ""putrid"" smell in early September. He said he initially thought it was something in his own trash can making the smell, which he said lingered for at least a week. With recent news, he\'s reconsidered. Another business park neighbor was so overwhelmed by the odor that he approached Hallford about it. ""He was back there laser-engraving some wood and said that was what (the smell) was, and that he would ventilate it,"" said the neighbor. ""It didn\'t smell at all like burning wood, though."" The neighbor said it took a call to the landlord and some additional days for the smell to dissipate. DeWitte said Hallford also approached him and asked if the ""wood burning"" smell was bothering him. ""Seemed like an ordinary guy,"" DeWitte said of Hallford. DeWitte and other business park neighbors said that business had seemed slow for Return to Nature in recent weeks. The Elkton location was closed Friday, a lone lamp left on in the interior. A minivan with tinted windows and an empty gurney in the back remained parked in the rear. The business had previous locations on Las Animas Street and East Platte Avenue. Neighbors of the East Platte building said the business was quiet. One resident, Ruben Villando, said he only recalls two services there. The types of environmental services Return to Nature was offering have been growing in popularity in recent years. But it\'s unclear how many clients the business has drawn. The Return to Nature website lists 22 obituaries, with the oldest from late 2022. The business charged $1,895 for a natural burial and graveside ceremony. The price did not include a casket or cemetery space. In one case, the funeral home made a casket for a customer out of a cardboard box and burlap, The Gazette said previously. The price list said cremation cost $1,290 and included a biodegradable cremation urn. The business announced on its website it was ending cremation services in July'}]"

BGCSLV was in significant need of administrative office space. When Miltenberger took the helm in 2018, the organization had seven staff and one site. Under his direction and just five years later, BGCSLV now has almost 60 staff and eight — soon to be nine — sites. But rapid growth left 15 administrative staff without offices. Desks placed in spaces also used for BGCSLV programs with kids wasn’t working out, for anyone. In June of 2022, Miltenberger went on the hunt for office space to rent. “(BGCSLV) has a moral obligation to keep our money local and help the downtown economy,” he said. “We looked at space across from Friday Health and on the outside of town. We knew the Democrats were going to vacate offices in the building on San Juan, so we thought we should take a look.” As the saying goes, timing is everything. The building has an interesting history. Built in the late 1920s, it was the location of the first automotive dealer in Alamosa. For the past 27 years, it has been the site of a little known but very successful company that made Hawaiian cookies to sell in other markets. The owners of the building — the Peter Tamada family trust and their partners, the Yoshimuras — were considering their options as health concerns had prompted them to “make a shift.” When Tammy Yoshimura saw Miltenberger checking out the building, she came outside and asked if she could help him. Miltenberger’s goal was to rent a space flexible enough to provide a few private offices but also a common area where people could meet and “pop up” their laptop to do some work but also permanent enough to keep “their stuff” on site. “We looked at the space and thought…yeah, we could make this work.” And then Yoshimura asked him if he wanted to see the rest of the building. That simple question changed the entire trajectory of things. “I had no idea what we were walking into, but as soon as I started looking around, all these things started to align. How do we preserve a building so that real estate prospectors from California don’t buy it, have it sit vacant until it appreciates in value and then flip it?

As soon as other non-profit partners heard that he was looking for space, he started getting calls. SLV GO! had grown and needed more room. Southwest Conservation Corps’ three crews were transporting a trailer full of equipment back and forth to Salida every day because they had no place to store it safely in Alamosa. SLV Gen Wild was looking for space as was SLV Local Food Coalition who needed more commercial kitchen space and other resources. “All these incredible assets in this building played into what was needed. The commercial kitchen is one. Office space is another.” And, thus, was born The Hub. Although parts of the building are still undergoing extensive renovation, the potential of the 13,000 square foot building is enormous. There is a garage space that will accommodate crews with Southwest Conservation Corps. A large commercial kitchen will not only provide needed space to SLV Local Food Coalition, but also space for caterers and cottage food operators who need larger, commercial-grade facilities for food preparation.

and to discuss the latest scientific research into these and other plant-based or synthetic substances, all known as psychedelics.Organizers hailed the conference, called Psychedelic Science, as a coming out party for a subculture that has become increasingly visible over the last decade as studies and clinical trials have unveiled the potential applications of these substances in the mental health field.See also: Our glossary of common psychedelic termsA politically diverse group of high-profile speakers, including NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Grammy-award-winning musician Melissa Etheridge and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, advocated for the normalized use of psychedelics to combat the fear perpetuated by Richard Nixon’s war on drugs, and spread the message about the drugs’ healing potential.“It’s still ridiculous that in this day and age, somebody suffering from anxiety, depression, PTSD can get medical coverage for very costly prescription drugs but cannot get coverage for a treatment at a healing center that can address some of the underlying causes of the issue,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said during his keynote speech at Psychedelic Science.Polis noted that one pressing issue is weaving psychedelic therapy into the conventional payer system, whether that is insurance, Medicaid or Medicare, and he called on insurance companies to provide coverage for this new type of therapy. He also pledged to work to expunge the records of Coloradans with psychedelics-related charges so that “doesn’t hold them back from future employment opportunities.”As research into psychedelics grows, so does public interest. In a June national poll of 1,500 registered voters, 61% said they support creating a regulated, legal framework for the therapeutic use of psychedelics, according to the UC Berkeley Center for the Science of Psychedelics, which conducted the survey.Last November, 54% of Colorado voters approved a measure to legalize medicinal psilocybin. Regulators are now building a new industry around psychedelic therapy, which is expected to take shape over the next year and a half. By 2025, Coloradans ages 21 and up can expect to be able to book a psilocybin-assisted therapy session. In the meantime, however, it’s worth understanding exactly what psychedelics are, how they work and what their current and future applications could be for the general public.What are psychedelicsFor centuries, certain plants have been used in religious ceremonies, but momentum has only recently been building to adopt them for medicinal purposes in Western cultures. Enthusiasm in the 1950s and ‘60s led to robust research into drugs like LSD, otherwise known as acid, and the effects of psychedelics. Though much of that enthusiasm was quashed by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, studies and trials have rebounded, leading many researchers to proclaim the arrival of a “psychedelic renaissance.”Broadly speaking, psychedelics is an umbrella term that refers to several psychoactive drugs, also deemed hallucinogens. Some, like psilocybin, mescaline and ibogaine, occur naturally in mushrooms, cactus and iboga root, respectively. Others, like chemical compounds LSD and MDMA, also known as “ecstasy” or “molly,” originated in laboratories.While there is sometimes debate about exactly which drugs classify as psychedelics, Berkeley’s Center for the Science of Psychedelics distinguishes between “classic” and “non-classic psychedelics” based on how each interacts with the brain.Classic psychedelics affect serotonin 2A receptors in the brain and the central nervous system, causing sensitivity to touch, light and sound, as well as visualizations and an altered perception of time. Examples include ayahuasca, DMT, 5-meO-DMT, LSD, psilocybin and mescaline. Experiences using these substances, also called trips or journeys, have been widely portrayed in movies and media, often in association with the psychedelia of the 1960s.While non-classical psychedelics may produce similar physical and visual effects, they do not interact as prominently, if at all, with serotonin 2A receptors. Instead, these substances affect other neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine and glutamate. Examples include MDMA, ketamine (also known as special K) and ibogaine.How do psychedelics worksAccording to the UC Berkeley Center for the Science of Psychedelics, some research suggests that classic psychedelics can help temporarily rewire the brain and promote neuroplasticity, meaning the growth of new neural networks, by increasing and strengthening those connections. Often that means parts of the brain that don’t typically communicate appear able to transfer data while under the influence.What’s significant about this, according to the nonprofit Beckley Foundation, which has been researching psychedelics since 1988, is that many of those stimulated areas of the brain are part of the default mode network, which neurologically “polices the amount of sensory information that enters our sphere of awareness.” That includes the sense of self or the ego.Some substances suppress the default mode network allowing for free-flowing communication between previously segregated parts of the brain. Anecdotally, many participants in drug trials recall gaining new perspectives on behaviors or traumatic events.That is, in part, why researchers see such promise in using psychedelics to treat conditions such as addiction, PTSD and more.Studies by Johns Hopkins University found psilocybin, specifically, can decrease end-of-life anxiety among cancer patients, help longtime smokers kick a nicotine addiction, and reduce depression symptoms. Additionally, Colorado regulators are considering fast-tracking the use of ibogaine in the regulated therapy system for its potential in treating opioid addiction.It is worth noting, however, that many of the aforementioned studies were done in small groups, with some including as few as 14 people. And there are still risks associated with ingesting psychedelics, from anxiety and hallucinations to circumstances that prove fatal. (For example, the William G. Nash Foundation honors its namesake 21-year-old who died not because of drug toxicity, but because he asphyxiated on protein powder while under the influence.)When Colorado voters approved Prop 122, which legalized medicinal psilocybin, they also changed the law to decriminalize five substances – psilocybin, psilocin, DMT, ibogaine, and mescaline – meaning it is no longer illegal to possess, use, grow or share a personal amount. The state legislature clarified “personal amount” as a 12-foot by 12-foot grow area on private property.Before using psychedelics, experts advocate considering the set and setting, or personal mindset and environment, in which you plan to do so.How do people use psychedelicsMost plant-based psychedelics maintain centuries-long roots in indigenous cultures that use them as spiritual sacraments. The Aztecs, for example, referred to psilocybin as teonanácatl, meaning “sacred mushroom” or “God’s flesh.”The potent mushrooms were only introduced to Western society after Mazatec shaman María Sabina invited writer R. Gordon Wasson to a ritual ceremony in Mexico that he later recounted in “Life” magazine in 1957. Wasson is credited with coining the term “magic mushroom” and causing a barrage of tourists to travel to Mexico in search of their own psychedelic experiences. (María Sabina, for her part, was shunned by her community for commercializing the sacred medicine.)Despite the deluge of studies, most people using psychedelics are doing so outside the clinical context.

El 15 de septiembre, más de 300 estudiantes del distrito escolar de Perkiomen Valley en Pensilvania se marcharon para protestar por la decisión de la junta escolar de no aprobar la Política propuesta 720, que habría prohibido a los niños con confusión de género usar los baños de niñas, informó Fox News. En comentarios a Fox, el presidente de la junta escolar, Jason Saylor, dijo que había “votado de manera diferente a la mayoría de la junta” y expresó su agradecimiento por los “más de 300 estudiantes que utilizaron su derecho de la Primera Enmienda para expresar su opinión a favor de la política durante su protestar el viernes”, aunque explicó que “respeta el resultado de la votación”. La propuesta se originó después de que el padre de una adolescente que asiste a una de las escuelas secundarias del distrito publicara en las redes sociales que su hija se había angustiado emocionalmente después de una interacción con una persona que parecía ser un niño con confusión de género en el baño de niñas. “El hecho es que mi hija irá a la escuela y no usará el baño aquí ahora”, dijo el padre, Tim Jagger, en una publicación en las redes sociales. “Está demasiado alterada y perturbada emocionalmente para entrar al baño”. La junta escolar consideró la política de prohibir a los niños usar los baños de niñas en una reunión del 12 de septiembre, segun informó una filial local de ABC. “¿Creemos que es correcto y justo que los estudiantes tengan acceso a cualquier baño que quieran dependiendo de cómo se identifiquen?” dijo el presidente de la junta escolar, Jason Saylor, durante la reunión. “¿Creemos que eso es apropiado? Es mi opinión personal, no lo hago”. Sin embargo, la superintendente Barbara Russell argumentó que el cambio propuesto iba en contra de la política de “no discriminación” existente del distrito que se alinea con el Título IX y “destaca la identificación de género como una clase protegida”. La junta escolar optó por no implementar la política propuesta, lo que provocó la protesta estudiantil en la que cientos de estudiantes abandonaron sus aulas el viernes. El estudiante de secundaria John Ott, que organizó la huelga, dijo a Fox el lunes que la protesta se llevó a cabo porque “los niños estaban molestos” y querían “proteger” a las niñas que “no querían hombres en sus baños”. “Es necesario que haya algunos cambios. Es simplemente incómodo ver a hombres de 19 o 18 años en el baño”, compartió Victoria Rudolph, estudiante de Perkiomen Valley. Otro estudiante, Brandon Emery, argumentó que la priorización de privilegios para los estudiantes que se identifican como “trans” va en contra de sus propios derechos y los de su hermana y otros estudiantes. “Me hace sentir como si los derechos de mi hermana, yo y el resto de los estudiantes estuvieran ahora comprometidos y no fueran una prioridad para esta escuela en absoluto”, dijo Emery a Fox. Las madres de los estudiantes también compartieron sus preocupaciones y expresaron su agradecimiento por sus hijos y compañeros de clase que se opusieron a la negativa de la escuela a proteger la privacidad de las niñas de secundaria. La madre de Ott dijo al medio que “la seguridad de las mujeres es muy importante” y que la decisión de los estudiantes de protestar debería “ser elogiada”. “Tienen coraje y ejercen sus derechos de la Primera Enmienda”, dijo. “Se trata de proteger a nuestros hijos y nuestra privacidad, a los niños y niñas. Es biología simple”. Asimismo, la madre de Emery, Melanie Marren, criticó al distrito por “hacer estas políticas sin tomar en consideración cómo afectan a los estudiantes…” Según Marren, el distrito no tiene en cuenta “lo incómodo que es ser un adolescente en general, pero ahora tiene que enfrentarse a la invasión de su privacidad en aquellas áreas en las que debería sentirse seguro y privado”. La asignación generalizada de niños y hombres a espacios designados para niñas y mujeres (incluidos baños, vestuarios y vestuarios) ha provocado un debate nacional y una serie de leyes que representan ambos lados del problema. Los conservadores advierten que obligar a niñas y mujeres a compartir espacios íntimos con hombres desconocidos viola sus derechos de privacidad, las somete a un estrés emocional innecesario y les da a posibles depredadores masculinos un pretexto viable para entrar a baños o casilleros de mujeres simplemente alegando su condición de transgénero. ¿Cierre del gobierno?

Please give us a call at 970-249-3444 Copyright © • Wick Communications Terms of Use | Privacy Policy Assistant Editor and Senior Writer Daniel Santana-Perez (MCSO) A motorist near Olathe watched what he initially thought was a plastic tarp come out the window of a car Thursday, before realizing it was something else: A woman. Investigators allege the woman’s boyfriend, identified as Daniel Santana-Perez, had earlier come to the Olathe home where she was picking up items, entered without permission, assaulted her, then forced her into his vehicle before driving away. The woman escaped by jumping out as the car went up the hill on Colorado 348. According to court documents, she sustained injuries so severe that she could only nod yes or no when an Olathe officer tried to interview her later in the hospital; she ultimately was taken to St. Mary’s in Grand Junction for further care. Santana-Perez was later arrested during the course of an hours-long multi-agency law enforcement response when he was spotted walking on U.S. 50 in Delta County, Olathe Police Chief Frank Rodriguez said. Officers determined Santana-Perez had earlier crashed his car into a vineyard near Cedar Road and left it. Santana-Perez was armed with a rifle at the time police contacted him, the chief said, but he was arrested without further incident on suspicion of first-degree kidnapping, second-degree assault and first-degree burglary as acts of domestic violence. Santana-Perez is also suspected of leaving the scene of an accident, as well as driving on a revoked license. Formal charges are due by end of business Dec. 20. If he is formally charged with and convicted of the class-1 felony kidnapping charge, he faces a mandatory life sentence, Montrose County Judge Laura Harvell advised him Friday, before ordering him held on a $500,000 cash-only bond. “It was a joint operation that included the Montrose County Sheriff’s Office, Colorado State Patrol and Delta County Sheriff’s Office,” Rodriguez said Friday. “We searched multiple residences in Olathe and around Olathe, hence the large law enforcement presence in evening hours. There were lots of concerns expressed. At no time was the public in any danger and had they been, we obviously would have taken appropriate steps.” According to an arrest affidavit, shortly after 1 p.m. Thursday, a frantic woman called dispatch about a disturbance at her U.S. 50 home in Olathe involving the woman and Santana-Perez. Dispatch logs referenced in the document showed a developing situation, with reports Santana-Perez had come to the door and was attacking the homeowner, then threw a coffee table at her. Other dispatch calls coming in near the same time stated a woman had “bailed” from a vehicle as it traveled up Olathe Hill. When Olathe Police Officer Alex Angel arrived at the home, he found the resident hysterical and the house in disarray, with what appeared to be blood drops on the doorstep and door. The resident told him that “Daniel” had come inside and dragged the woman he was dating out. “(Witness) stated that Daniel had just barged inside the house and began beating on (woman) on the couch and onto the floor. (Witness) stated Daniel grabbed (woman) and left, and she pointed west,” Angel wrote in the affidavit. As the officer began to look for the vehicle, reports of a woman a jumping from a car on the highway came in. Angel went to that location, where he saw first responders treating the woman who had been at the home. There, two motorists reported seeing her jump from a vehicle that had just passed them in a no-passing zone. Another motorist said he saw the car on the shoulder and thought a tarp was falling from it, “but when he passed, he saw a person out of the car.” Angel returned to the home to speak with the witness there again. When prompted for clarification, the witness said the woman had used her (the witness’) cell phone to call Santana-Perez. As relayed in the affidavit, the witness then saw a vehicle pull onto her driveway, only barely missing two double glass doors, and alleged Santa-Perez then came inside uninvited. The witness told him not to touch the woman “and that is when Daniel flipped the coffee table towards (witness).” The witness fled into a bedroom and locked herself inside, but could hear the other woman being assaulted outside, the affidavit said. Another officer interviewed the injured woman at Montrose Regional Health. According to the affidavit, she was physically incapable of speaking, but nodded “yes” when asked if Santana-Perez had assaulted her. She also nodded “yes” when asked if they were in a relationship. The document notes she was to be flown to St. Mary’s for more medical care. Rodriguez on Friday said she was last known to be in stable condition; later in court, it was noted the woman needed surgery. Thursday, Angel and multiple other peace officers searched for Santana-Perez. Angel found footage showing the suspect car leaving the U.S. 50 home where the alleged assault occurred and heading west onto 348. He also located addresses of family members and with an MCSO sheriff’s sergeant, went to the home of Santana-Perez’s father. Angel wrote the elder Santana “appeared disappointed” when he found out why the officers were seeking his son. He had not seen the younger man, but said he would have him turn himself in. Word of a car crash involving the suspect car came in as Angel prepared the arrest affidavit. A property owner on Cedar Road found it wrecked and abandoned in his vineyard. With Rodriguez, Angel went to the home of another Santana family member and searched it with permission, but Santana-Perez wasn’t there. Rodriguez said the suspect was located about eight hours after the initial incident, walking on the highway. “I cannot compliment law enforcement agencies enough for their discipline and professionalism,” the chief said, also thanking WestCO dispatch. “The entire community was very cooperative and receptive to our presence. People that he has been acquainted with allowed us to search their homes. They don’t have to. It just speaks to how amazing our community is,” Rodriguez said. The reported victim was placed in fear, he also said. Deputy District Attorney Ishtiaque Hossain cited safety risks in asking for a high, cash-only bond Friday when Santana-Perez was advised. “Mr. Santana-Perez has demonstrated he is a risk to public safety as evidenced in this case, when he entered a property without authorization. … this not only caused harm to (victim) but also fear and insecurity of other residents of the property, and that property was damaged,” Hossain said. Hossain also went through Santana-Perez’s criminal history, which includes driving under restraint, misdemeanor assault, violating a protection order, disorderly conduct, driving while ability impaired — and multiple failures to appear in court in three of those cases. Santana-Perez did not have an attorney during the hearing: at the start, the public defender informed Harvell that his office has a conflict and he could not reach alternate defense counsel in time for court. Owing to the first-degree felony alleged, the court is also required to have ADC appointed through Denver, Harvell said. The local public defender’s office is to immediately file a motion to conflict off the case so that this process can begin. Harvell therefore advised Santana-Perez of the arrest charges and their penalties. She told him he could speak as to bond, but that he had the legal right not to make a statement and in that event, a second bond hearing would be set. Santana-Perez opted for the latter. A new bond hearing was slated for Dec. 14. Harvell went through similarly charged offenses in the 7th Judicial District, noting bonds of $500,000 in a January murder case and a $2 million bond in a double homicide case in Delta County. She said she’s concerned about possible harassment or retaliation against the named victim and witnesses if Santana-Perez is released without the appropriate restrictions. Based on the arrest charges and other factors, Harvell set bail at $500,000 cash-only. Katharhynn Heidelberg is the Montrose Daily Press assistant editor and senior writer.

The proposed roundabout at the intersection of Brush Creek Road and Owl Creek Road has been a topic of discussion before several Town Councils, going back to 2008, Public Works Director Anne Martens said. Current and former council members pored over different iterations of the roundabout’s design during meetings from 2019-2022 and diverged on how the project would impact the surrounding land and the character of the village. But public works leaders, as well as local fire and police departments, agree the roundabout would improve safety and traffic on the town’s main thoroughfare. In a Town Council work session Monday night where an updated design for the roundabout was presented, Mayor Bill Madsen said that the town should “bite the bullet” and finally move forward on the project. “I think we also have to keep in mind this is our artery,” Madsen said. “This is the way we get in and out of our village, we don’t have another option. Brush Creek Road is it and we got to make sure that it functions really well.” The Town Council asked the public works department and SGM, an engineering, consulting, and surveying firm that has worked on several designs of the roundabout project, to move forward with a more robust design phase, using funds earmarked in the 2024 budget for the roundabout design. About $250,000 was approved in the budget in early November for the next phase of the design process. But some council members expressed concern that the project would further urbanize the village. “For me, this roundabout will change the character of Snowmass Village. It’s going to completely alter the arrival experience, so we have to prepare ourselves for what that means,” Council Member Britta Gustafson said. “I want to weigh all the opportunities we have to make improvements and do the right thing for safety, functionality and traffic, with the impact and effect that’s going to have on creating a much more suburban, urbanized approach to our little village.” Gustafson, who lives near the intersection, said she has not noticed problems with traffic on Brush Creek Road. Council Member Alyssa Shenk said the construction of the roundabout at Brush Creek, Wood, and Kearns roads has drastically changed traffic in the village for the better. While she recognized some residents may not like the idea of another roundabout, it would ultimately create a safer driving experience in the village, and agreed the town should finally move forward with the project. “I will say, when we had the discussion about the Wood Road/Brush Creek Road roundabout it was the same thing, people were like, ‘Oh my god, it’s going to change everything…’ But honestly I can’t imagine how life was before the roundabout,” Shenk said. “I just feel like it creates, to me, a better arrival experience and it also takes out or eliminates the guesswork of what you have to do.” The design stage is moving forward after the completion of a months-long construction on the Brush Creek culvert jumpstarted construction talks. The roundabout has been a topic of discussion before several Town Councils and has often been touted as a method to improve safety and traffic on one of the main thoroughfares leading to the Upper Village. Public works officials frequently identified the Brush Creek culvert, which runs below Brush Creek Road at its intersection with Owl Creek Road, as a project that would need to be addressed in the larger roundabout construction because of its failing infrastructure. Construction of the culvert, which spanned six months and was completed in early November, helped renew conversations about the Brush Creek/Owl Creek roundabout, Martens said. “When we first started this conversation about the roundabout, I hadn’t really gone through the whole phasing of the construction project,” she said during the work session. “Well, it told me how it’s going to be phased, in the sense that that culvert was the first phase.” The last time the Town Council heard an update on the roundabout project was in January 2022 when council members asked the design team to eliminate a proposed “slip lane” that would allow for people turning right from Brush Creek onto Owl Creek to bypass the roundabout. The current proposed design is a 115-foot roundabout with bus pullouts on either end of Brush Creek Road and crosswalks on each intersection of the roundabout. The roundabout would be the same size as the roundabout at the intersections of Brush Creek, Wood, and Kearns roads, which was completed in 2016 and has drastically improved traffic in that area, some Town Council members said in the Monday work session. Much of the roundabout construction would be lowering the road grades, the highest of which reaches 10% and often leads to speeding on Brush Creek Road, Martens said. She estimated the overall cost of the project to be around $5 million, but added that a more in-depth design process will give a better idea of costs and a project timeline. The timeline for the design phase and the project is still unclear. Because it was a work session, the Town Council did not vote on anything, but directed staff to proceed with the design and come back in the future with construction costs and potential timelines.

Jimmie Dale Goddard was born February 21st, 1938, in Imperial Nebraska, to Cyril and Gwenn Goddard. Jimmie attended Imperial Grade School and Chase County High School in Imperial Nebraska. Soon after high school graduation, Jimmie joined the U. S. Air Force on August 27th, 1956, acquiring training for and serving as a Munitions Specialist, until his honorable discharge on August 26th, 1960. His training and service included assignments in: Cannon AFB – New Mexico, Travis AFB – California, Lowry AFB – Colorado, Turner AFB – Georgia, Hahn Air Base near Kirchberg, Germany and finally, Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan.

Jimmie’s vocations included serving as a draftsman for Behrent Engineering, then later store operations, management and eventual ownership of Acre Brothers Carpet and Linoleum, the latter spanning 30 years. Jimmie and Judy nurtured a love of the outdoors with their children through many family excursions to the area lakes, the Rocky Mountains and hunting grounds around Sterling, Colorado. Jimmie and Judy divorced in 1985. Jimmie married Meda Snow in 1986 and retired from the carpet and linoleum business in 1999, relocating from the Denver area to Berthoud, Colorado, in 2002.

One Canadian company that has been prospecting the area for the past three years says it’s generating promising results, though any possible major mining operation is years off. “We wouldn’t continue our activity if we weren’t seeing encouraging results,” Greg Johnson, president of Metallic Minerals, said in an interview last week. “But we’re many years away from developing a mine; we’re in the exploration stage, and that takes years of systematic scientific work.” In 2019, Metallic Minerals announced an ambitious plan to explore more than 8,000 acres of a mining claim in La Plata Canyon. Ever since, the company has been drilling holes to investigate the potential deposits in the mountains and even acquired new areas to explore. La Plata Canyon, a relatively contained mountain range just west of Durango, experienced a lucrative yet short-lived mining boom in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Metallic Minerals, however, has maintained that new technology could revive the region. The few full-time residents that call La Plata Canyon home, however, have expressed concerns that mining’s return could have negative environmental impacts. “We’ve been concerned since they started,” Tom Miller, who bought property in the canyon in 1998, said. All these concerns about a full-fledged mine may be years, perhaps decades, off, Johnson said. Still, the company’s findings in the canyon continually justify the decision to dedicate more money and resources into exploration. Don’t call it a comeback At the turn of the century, La Plata Canyon was a bustling hub of mining activity, the scars of which can be seen to this day. Around the 1940s, however, most mines folded and closed up shop, and there has been no major commercial operation ever since. But that hasn’t stopped prospectors over the years from dreaming about the resources that remain in the mountains. Several companies and individuals have touted the potential of precious minerals in La Plata Canyon, though nothing has ever materialized. Metallic Minerals, which specializes in the exploration and development of mining claims, first started drilling exploratory holes in summer 2020. The specific claim is called the Allard, located up a steep western slope, across from the La Plata City Campground. For the past three years, those initial explorations produced encouraging results to inspire the company to continue its operation – and its investment, Johnson said. But, he made a point to emphasize these are still early days. “At this stage, we’re still trying to assess what’s there,” he said. However, early results, Johnson said, show the potential for copper, silver, gold and other critical minerals, which the U.S. Geological Survey defines as “necessary for the manufacture of high technology devices, national defense applications and green growth-related industries.” On edge But, even the potential for mining’s return has some residents concerned. Miller, whose property is closest to the drilling operations, said many companies and people have tried to revive mining in La Plata Canyon over the years. Metallic Minerals’ effort, however, feels different, he said. “We have people putting stakes out here all the time,” Miller said. “But (Metallic Minerals) is putting more money into it than your average hobby miner. It’s just concerning, given the level of investment.” Miller expressed the oft-repeated concerns whenever a new mine is proposed – impacts to water quality and groundwater, possible contamination, increased traffic and an overall impact to the quality and character of the landscape. “I know they’re just exploring, but it becomes a much bigger concern if it progresses to mining,” Miller said. “And they’re putting a lot of money into it, so they must think it’s going somewhere.” Vince Meunier, another resident in the canyon, said neighbors held a community meeting this fall to get more organized. “The community is unaware of the permits that have been given and the serious possibility of active larger-scale mining happening in the canyon,” he said. “I think it is very important for the local community to become aware of this and to try to do something to stop it from happening.” Under the microscope Russ Means, an environmental specialist with Colorado’s Department of Mining, Reclamation and Safety, said Metallic Minerals is in good standing with all the state’s permitting processes and posted state-required financial warranties and reclamation bonds for its work in La Plata Canyon. Means said site visits to where Metallic Minerals is drilling has shown the company is also following regulations. Lynn Hyde, Community Development Director for La Plata County, also said Metallic Minerals is in good standing. In contrast to years past, Metallic Minerals will have to submit a feasibility process form to determine whether the company needs a land-use permit before starting work in 2023, Hyde said. Should the time come for a full-on mine, that would kick off a years-long process of studies, public hearings and reviews that would involve a host of agencies: DRMS, La Plata County, Forest Service and others. “We’re only one part of oversight,” Means said. “There’s a whole process for federal land, state permits, local county approval for anyone to get a permit to mine in Colorado. It’s an extensive process.” Just taking a look Metallic Minerals is an exploration company, which means it investigates the potential of a mining claim and builds a portfolio it can use to entice actual mining companies. That can take years, Johnson said, as is the case in La Plata Canyon. Early findings showed an estimated 1.21 million pounds of copper and 17.6 million ounces of silver – findings that can be used to lure investors for continued funding on exploration and ultimately a mining company. “We’re looking for concentrations (of resources) to find economic justification,” Johnson said. “That’s the tough part after first discovery – finding something with high enough concentration to draw interest. And our explorations show we have something interesting.” As a result of all the intricacies, there’s no way to put a timeline on the project, he added. But, he said the metals that could be mined could help with the green energy transition. And, he said mining is far more regulated and environmentally conscious than years past. “It’s a very different mining industry today than the turn of the century, and that’s a good thing,” he said. “Colorado has a long history of mineral development, and if we can develop it responsibly and with high environmental standards, that’s good for the economy and environment.” But those promises do little to allay residents’ concerns. Just this past year, Miller noticed a significant increase in activity on the site. (Johnson said that’s because the company drilled four holes as opposed to the two in 2022, effectively doubling activity in the area.) “Past studies have shown the ore quality is low and marginally worth it,” Miller said. “I’m crossing my fingers that this is still the case, but it makes you nervous. We’ll keep watching it closely.” Pre-July 2016 Archives Durango Telegraph eEdition'}]"

At the time, Mental Health Colorado, Vail Behavioral Health and two members of the state’s behavioral health task force wrote letters to Gov. Jared Polis’ office supporting the decision to appoint Barnes, while some members of the stakeholder advisory group supported retaining Medlock.In a complaint to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed on Aug. 30, Medlock alleged that Barnes and other senior leaders in Polis’ administration were “racially hostile” from the early months of her tenure. The complaint said Medlock, who is Black, felt mistreated by other members of the administration, who are mostly white.“From the beginning, it was some kind of power struggle,” she said in an interview.Rep. Dafna Michaelson Jenet, a Democrat who will represent parts of Adams County in the state senate next year, said the complaint mischaracterizes what happened.She and other lawmakers had heard concerns from Behavioral Health Administration employees that the culture was “toxic” and from service providers that they wouldn’t have contracts in place in time, possibly leading to interruptions in care, she said. “The concern was that the BHA was going to fail,” she said. “We could not afford for the BHA to fail.”Representatives for the Behavioral Health Administration referred questions to Polis’ office. Maria De Cambra, director of communications and community engagement for the governor, said the EEOC hasn’t contacted the state about the complaint.“If they do reach out to our office, our legal team will cooperate and vigorously defend against any allegations,” she said in a statement.Some EEOC complaints are dismissed for procedural reasons, such as that the alleged victim waited too long to file it. If EEOC staff determine the complaint has met the procedural requirements, the commission has 180 days to investigate it. The complainant can choose whether to have the agency issue a ruling, or to take the case before an administrative judge. Complainants also can choose to file lawsuits separately at certain points in the process.EEOC complaints are generally not made public, unless the agency finds evidence of discrimination, though the person who filed a complaint can choose to share it.Medlock, who shared her complaint with The Denver Post, alleged that two of her subordinates wanted her to be a “public face” for the agency while they handled most of its operations. She also said her white colleagues “challenged” her authority in meetings and didn’t intervene when others used racial slurs in her presence.Rep. Judy Amabile, a Boulder Democrat who sponsored the bill pushing back certain deadlines for the agency, said she didn’t know if anyone had mistreated Medlock, but said the Behavioral Health Administration was behind on the work it was supposed to have done by early 2023. Advocates for people with serious mental illnesses, like schizophrenia, also were concerned that the agency under Medlock wasn’t putting enough emphasis on their needs, she said.“I don’t know what was in anybody’s mind,” Amabile said. “I do know that from the perspective of the people the BHA was meant to serve, the patients, there was a disconnect.”Medlock denied missing deadlines and pointed to listening sessions she held around the state. A performance review she shared was generally favorable, with its main recommendation that she and Barnes work on their relationship as colleagues.She also alleged Barnes attempted to undermine her by circulating a survey to Behavioral Health Administration employees. That survey found about 45% were dissatisfied with the agency’s senior leadership, 40% were satisfied and 15% had no opinion. State departments conduct annual surveys assessing employees’ level of engagement in their jobs.The EEOC complaint said the conflict with others in the administration began to escalate in March, when Medlock wanted to hire a Black woman for the open job of chief of staff at the Behavioral Health Administration, and Polis’ chief of staff Alec Garnett disagreed with her choice. The complaint said “intense” meetings followed, culminating in her firing a few weeks later. The candidate’s name and previous experience weren’t included in the complaint.“It was an incredibly painful experience,” Medlock said of the conflicts. “The power dynamic that women of color often experience is you can be in power, but not be in control.”Michaelson Jenet said she and other lawmakers got Garnett involved when they went to him with the concerns they’d heard. The decision to fire Medlock wasn’t based on personality conflicts, but on poor performance, she said.“I think that it unfortunately had to happen,” Michaelson Jenet said.Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get health news sent straight to your inbox.
