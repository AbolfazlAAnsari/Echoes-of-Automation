""A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution,"" he wrote.

""I need ammunition, not a ride."" — Zelenskyy, response to U.S. offer to transport him to safety, Feb. 26. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with the U.S. Congress from Kyiv where his country continues to wage war with Russian forces in what officials call an unprovoked attack by President Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy implored members of Congress to help institute a no-fly zone and continue to enforce additional sanctions until the Russian military stops its assault. After playing a video showing some of the damage in Ukraine, Zelenskyy spoke in English to reiterate how important his request was. 2. ""Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution."" — Trump, post on Truth Social network, Dec. 3. 3. ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start."" — U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, writing in the court\'s opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade and took away women’s constitutional protections for abortion, June 24. 4. ""The Court reverses course today for one reason and one reason only: because the composition of this Court has changed."" — U.S. Supreme Court Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, writing in the dissenting opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\'s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade, June 24. 5. ""Will Smith just smacked the s--- out of me."" — Comedian Chris Rock at the Academy Awards ceremony, March 27. Will Smith sat down with FOX Entertainment\'s Kevin McCarthy to talk about his new film, ""Emancipation,"" after the controversy surrounding the incident at the Oscars where the actor slapped comedian Chris Rock. McCarthy talked about asking Smith what he would say to those movie watchers who aren\'t sure whether they are ready to see the actor back on stage after the awards show drama. 6. ""Jackie, are you here? Where’s Jackie?"" — U.S. President Joe Biden, calling out for deceased Congresswoman Jackie Walorski, White House conference on ending hunger, Sept. 28. 7. ""FTX is fine. Assets are fine."" — Sam Bankman-Fried, a Twitter post shortly before his cryptocurrency exchange FTX declared bankruptcy, Nov. 7. In his first live appearance since the collapse of FTX, founder Sam Bankman-Fried took questions at the DealBook Summit regarding the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange he founded. Bankman-Fried spoke remotely from the Bahamas, where FTX is headquartered, rather than appearing in person. He is reportedly under investigation by the Dept. of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission and may face extradition to the U.S. in the future. Bankman-Fried is also expected to testify before congressional committees in the weeks ahead. 8. ""If you’re the President of the United States, you can declassify just by saying ‘It’s declassified,’ even by thinking about it."" — Trump, Fox News interview, Sept. 21. 9.

FOX 5 NY takes a look at how some of your favorite meals could soon be being made by robotic technology. NEW YORK - It\'s the art of making a slice of pizza with the efficiency of a machine. ""It\'s our robot assembly line,"" said Darryl Dueltgen, the founder of PizzaHQ. The shop in Woodland Park, New Jersey is rewriting the menu when it comes to making a pie. He says the shop can produce more than 300 pies an hour. ""A laser sees exactly how big the pizza is, puts the exact amount of toppings, sauce, cheese, pepperoni as many toppings as you want and then it comes out the other side with no human error, no waste, and very consistent, which is one of the issues with a regular pizzeria."" Automation in the kitchen has become more popular during the national labor shortage, especially when it comes to skilled workers in the kitchen. A shift to using more robotic technology makes repetitive tasks a bit more efficient and certainly more cost-effective in the long run. Many business owners also say it allows other workers to do more important roles within a restaurant. ""When you\'re in a restaurant, and you\'re one person down, you probably are going to miss expectations for what that guest is expecting because that restaurant was designed for. A certain number of people to come together to get your order,"" said Jake Brewer, Chief Strategy Officer at Miso Robotics. The company is transforming the industry with robotics and intelligent automation - from drinks to fries and even chips. The products are being used in restaurants like White Castle, Jack in the Box , and Chipotle. Miso says it is on a mission to bring the commercial kitchen into the current era. ""When you look at our product lineup, we have Flippy to which is focused on the fry station and filling that gap,"" Brewer said. This video from Miso Robotics shows the Flippy 2 cooking fried chicken. The machine is engineered to fry and flip nearly anything on its own - without much human assistance. The company also makes the ""Chippie"" -- or ""Flippy Lite"" because it focuses on solving chip issues for companies like Chipotle - which does ""batch cooking"" of chips in the morning. Robot fast-food chefs: Hype or a sign of industry change? There\'s also the ""Sippy Machine."" Brewer says that one does exactly what it sounds like. ""So it takes the order fills the cup lids, the cup and groups it so the person just has to turn around (and) grab,"" Brewer says. From the commercial kitchen, we move to something that could eventually end up in the home. Well, maybe not just any home as you will need a few hundred thousand dollars for this robot. Moley Robotics designs robots for cooking. It\'s from a company called Moley Robotics and, for as much as $340,000, innovators here created the world\'s first fully robotic kitchen. ""We have a dedicated place for cooking, we have some number of cooking tools and appliances and we have motion, like a motion which is done by human now,"" said Dr. Mark Oleynik, the company founder who is a computer scientist with a background in healthcare innovation. The product moves like a human arm, but this is all automated. It\'s filled with data base of recipes, from top chefs, brought to life by machine - everything from steaks, pastas, fine cuisine. Robot cooks come to home kitchens It\'s offering range from appetizers to full meals. ""Our kitchen is duplicate, it recreates the dish so generally, it copies the chef movements on the same environment to get the same result,"" Dr. Oleynik. The Robo-Burger cooks up hamburgers at the Newport Mall in Jersey City, N.J. Before we go back to taste that robotics slice of pizza at PizzaHQ in Woodland Park, we\'ve also got to tell you about you a burger that comes from a vending machine! The Robo-Burger is designed by former college roommates Audley Wilson and Dan Braido. It\'s a burger vending machine grilling up a fresh patty with the push of a button at the Newport Mall in Jersey City and a new location at a University in Queens. ""We\'ve been friends for a long time and focused on reinventing the food industry and produced this,"" Wilson said. And that brings us back to what\'s going on in the kitchen of PizzaHQ in New Jersey. They\'ve contracted with food service companies across the North Jersey area to provide cafeteria slices faster and more efficiently than most traditional shops. They also have become popular with party spots and can serve up pies for any occasion. So, about a bite of that slice? I gave it a try. It was tasty and delicious - and the pepperoni was just crispy enough (how I like it) -- definitely worth a try.
