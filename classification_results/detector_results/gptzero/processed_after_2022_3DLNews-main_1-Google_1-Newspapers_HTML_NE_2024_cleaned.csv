It’s “a 1930s-set story centered on the University of Washington’s rowing team, from their Depression-era beginnings to winning gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics,” according to imdb.com. Most of us don’t know much about rowing, the terms used in the sport or even what it requires. But Seward’s Ellen Jirovsky does. Jirovsky, a graduate of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, knows about rowing because she helped start the rowing team at UNL. She shared some of her memories before the movie Feb. 6. “The similaries of early rowing teams are shown from this movie on to the beginnings of Nebraska Crew,” she said. In 1973 she and another physical education major recruited 30 other UNL girls to start a team. Workouts included long-distance runs, stairs and trips to Branched Oak for rowing practice. The 30 recruits fell to 20 when they learned how demanding the sport was. At the time, Jirovsky said, boats were made of wood and weighed 400 pounds. Each rower had to be able to lift 50 pounds over her head. Weights were coffee cans filled with cement and attached to broom handles. Jirovsky was a physical education major and wanted to stay in shape. Crew seemed to be a good option, especially after passing Title IX. Jirovsky had a shell named after her in 2005 – a women’s eight, 60-foot long shell called the Ellen Havlovic Jirovsky, or the EJ. Crew is not a sanctioned sport at UNL, even after 50 years. It still holds club status. The boathouse at 16th and Y is still in use. And alumni are still seeking new crew members. Their annual banquet draws hundreds of alumni back to Lincoln to share stories and recruit. And that’s why Jirovsky chose to share her story at the Rivoli.

WASHINGTON — Any parent who\'s ever called one of their children by the other\'s name — or even the family pet\'s name — likely could empathize when President Joe Biden mixed up the names of French leaders Macron and Mitterrand. The human brain has trouble pulling names out of stuffed memory banks on cue. But when are those and other verbal stumbles normal, and when might they be a sign of cognitive trouble? ""When I see somebody make a flub on TV, I\'m really not all that concerned,"" said well-known aging researcher S. Jay Olshansky of the University of Illinois at Chicago. ""What science will tell you about flubs is that they\'re perfectly normal, and they are exacerbated by stress for sure."" Biden, 81, has a decadeslong history of verbal gaffes. But they\'re getting new attention after a special counsel last week decided Biden shouldn\'t face criminal charges for his handling of classified documents — while describing him as an old man with trouble remembering dates, even the date his son Beau died. That prompted a visibly angry Biden to lash out from the White House, saying, ""My memory is fine."" As for his son\'s 2015 death from brain cancer, ""Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, it wasn\'t any of their damn business,"" Biden said. President Joe Biden speaks Thursday in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House in Washington. Biden is not the only candidate making verbal slips. Former President Donald Trump, Biden\'s likely opponent in the November presidential election, has as well. Last month the 77-year-old Trump confused his major opponent for the GOP nomination, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Health experts caution that neither verbal gaffes nor a lawyer\'s opinions can reveal whether someone is having cognitive trouble. That takes medical testing. But certain glitches are common at any age. ""To easily recall names, right in the moment, is the hardest thing for us to do accurately,"" said Dr. Eric Lenze of Washington University in St. Louis, a geriatric psychiatrist who evaluates cognition in older adults. Some studies have suggested that everyday ""misnaming"" may occur when the brain has names stored by category — like your family members or perhaps in Biden\'s case, world leaders he\'s long known — and grabs the wrong one. Or the miss may be phonetic, as the names of France\'s current president, Emmanuel Macron, and former President Francois Mitterrand both begin with ""M."" Mitterrand died in 1996. Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks Thursday at a caucus night rally in Las Vegas. As for dates, emotion may tag certain memories but not run-of-the-mill ones, such as the special counsel\'s questions about when Biden handled a box of documents. ""Attaching a calendar date to an event is not really something that the human brain does at any age,"" Lenze said. It\'s ""not like a spreadsheet."" Whether it\'s a name, date or something else, memory also can be affected by stress and distractions — if someone\'s thinking about more than one thing, Olshansky said. And while everybody\'s had an ""it\'s on the tip of my tongue"" lapse, flubs by presidents, or would-be presidents, tend to be caught on TV. Olshansky watches recordings of his presentations at science meetings and ""there isn\'t a single time I don\'t make a mistake,"" he said. ""I\'m 69 years old, which I do not consider to be old, but I made the same mistakes when I was 39."" It\'s reasonable for people to wonder if leaders in their 70s and 80s remain sharp, Lenze said. What\'s reassuring is if what someone says is overall accurate despite a verbal gaffe. Some cognitive aging is normal, including delay in memory retrieval. People\'s brains age differently, and heart health, blood pressure and physical activity play a role in brain health. While Trump often brags about passing a screening-style memory test several years ago, Lenze said the best assessment includes rigorous neuropsychological testing. The health of a community can have a large impact on the local economy. It can influence the demand – or lack thereof – for specific goods, services, and infrastructure. In the case of seniors, health may be an indicator of longevity and overall well-being, dictating how insurance products and retirement planning should be laid out. With this in mind, SmartAsset ranked all states (except for Florida, for which data was not available) on health metrics across the population aged 65 and older, including obesity, smoking, arthritis, mental distress, disability status and more, to find where seniors are healthiest. U.S. states were ranked according to eight health variables for people aged 65 and older. These included: Data comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and reflects the most recent available data (2021). Limitations: Florida was excluded from this study due to a lack of available data. Self-reported data may be prone to biases across individuals.

to be the Republican presidential nominee, Americans should pause to consider what a second Trump term would mean for our country and the world and to weigh the serious responsibility this election places on their shoulders. By now, most American voters should have no illusions about who Mr. Trump is. During his many years as a real estate developer and a television personality, then as president and as a dominant figure in the Republican Party, Mr. Trump demonstrated a character and temperament that render him utterly unfit for high office. As president, he wielded power carelessly and often cruelly and put his ego and his personal needs above the interests of his country. Now, as he campaigns again, his worst impulses remain as strong as ever — encouraging violence and lawlessness, exploiting fear and hate for political gain, undermining the rule of law and the Constitution, applauding dictators — and are escalating as he tries to regain power. He plots retribution, intent on eluding the institutional, legal and bureaucratic restraints that put limits on him in his first term. Our purpose at the start of the new year, therefore, is to sound a warning. Mr. Trump does not offer voters anything resembling a normal option of Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, big government or small. He confronts America with a far more fateful choice: between the continuance of the United States as a nation dedicated to “the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity” and a man who has proudly shown open disdain for the law and the protections and ideals of the Constitution. If in 2016 various factions of the electorate were prepared to look beyond Mr. Trump’s bombast in the hope that he might deliver whatever it was they wanted without too much damage to the nation, today there is no mystery about what he will do should he win, about the sorts of people he will surround himself with and the personal and political goals he will pursue. There is no mystery, either, about the consequences for the world if America re-elects a leader who openly displays his contempt for its allies. Mr. Trump’s four years in the White House did lasting damage to the presidency and to the nation. He deepened existing divisions among Americans, leaving the country dangerously polarized; he so demeaned public discourse that many Americans have become inured to lies, insults and personal attacks at the highest levels of leadership. His contempt for the rule of law raised concerns about the long-term stability of American democracy, and his absence of a moral compass threatened to corrode the ideals of national service. The Republic weathered Mr. Trump’s presidency for a variety of reasons: his lack of prepared agenda, the disruptions of the Covid-19 pandemic and the efforts of appointees who tried to temper his most dangerous or unreasonable demands. Most important, it survived because of the people and institutions in his administration and in the Republican Party who proved strong enough to stand up to his efforts to undermine the peaceful transfer of power. It is instructive in the aftermath of that administration to listen to the judgments of some of these officials on the president they served. John Kelly, a chief of staff to Mr. Trump, called him the “most flawed person I’ve ever met,” someone who could not understand why Americans admired those who sacrificed their lives in combat. Bill Barr, who served as attorney general, and Mark Esper, a former defense secretary, both said Mr. Trump repeatedly put his own interests over those of the country. Even the most loyal and conservative of them all, Vice President Mike Pence, who made the stand that helped provoke Mr. Trump and his followers to insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, saw through the man: “On that day, President Trump also demanded that I choose between him and the Constitution,” he said. There will not be people like these in the White House should Mr. Trump be re-elected. The former president has no interest in being restrained, and he has surrounded himself with people who want to institutionalize the MAGA doctrine. According to reporting by the Times reporters Maggie Haberman, Charlie Savage and Jonathan Swan, Mr. Trump and his ideological allies have been planning for a second Trump term for many months already. Under the name Project 2025, one coalition of right-wing organizations has produced a thick handbook and recruited thousands of potential appointees in preparation for an all-out assault on the structures of American government and the democratic institutions that acted as checks on Mr. Trump’s power. The project ties in with plans from Mr. Trump and his supporters to reclassify tens of thousands of federal workers so they can be fired if they do not buy fully into the Trump agenda. He also plans to strip the Justice Department of its independence in order to use it to wreak vengeance on those who, in his view, failed to concoct a victory for him in the 2020 election or otherwise didn’t support his unconstitutional demands. There is more, including threats by Mr. Trump to find ways to use federal troops against those who might protest his policies and practices. These ambitions demonstrate that the years out of office and the mounting legal challenges he faces have only sharpened his worst instincts. Mr. Trump was impeached twice as president and since leaving office has been charged in four criminal cases — two related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, one over hush money paid to a porn star and another for hoarding classified documents after he left office and impeding the government’s efforts to retrieve them. No other sitting or former president has ever been indicted on criminal charges. Not only has Mr. Trump shown no remorse for these actions, he has given no sign that he understands these indictments to be anything but a political crusade meant to undermine him. He continues to claim that the Jan. 6 insurrection has been misrepresented. “There was love and unity,” he said in an interview last August. And he has suggested that, if re-elected, he could use his presidential powers to pardon himself. Mr. Trump’s forays into foreign affairs remain dangerously misguided and incoherent. During his presidency, he displayed consistent admiration for autocratic leaders — including Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un — and contempt for our democratic allies. While in the White House, he repeatedly threatened to leave NATO, an alliance critical to the stability of Europe that he sees only as a drain on American resources; now his campaign website says, without elaborating, that he plans to “finish” the process of “fundamentally re-evaluating NATO’s purpose and NATO’s mission.” He has announced his intention to abandon Ukraine, leaving it and its neighbors vulnerable to further Russian aggression. Encouraged by an American president, leaders who rule with an iron fist in Hungary, Israel, India and elsewhere would face far less moral or democratic pressure. Mr. Trump has made clear his conviction that only “losers” accept legal, institutional or even constitutional constraints. He has promised vengeance against his political opponents, whom he has called “ vermin ” and threatened with execution. This is particularly disturbing at a time of heightened concern about political violence, with threats increasing against elected officials of both parties. He has repeatedly demonstrated a deep disdain for the First Amendment and the basic principles of democracy, chief among them the right to freely express peaceful dissent from those in power without fear of retaliation, and he has made no secret of his readiness to expand the powers of the presidency, including the deployment of the military and the Justice Department, to have his way.

Not only do I like to outwait the year-end listicle tsunami, but the Midwest still flies economy when it comes to movie releases. The year’s best films are served to the first-class coasts before the theatrical flight attendant serves us here in the flatlands. Also, studios typically don’t release anything worth seeing the weekend of the Super Bowl, February’s only actual holiday. Sorry not sorry to all presidents and valentines. It is always fascinating to see the themes that emerge when this annual ranking is said and done. This year’s theme: Life is a bummer! Remove the three comedies and you have nothing but heartbreak, death, and Nazis. It’s like World War II made a mixtape. Speaking of bombs, let’s begin with the bad stuff! The Worst 5 Films I Saw Last Year 5.) Fast X Fast X has broken me upon its wheel, split me upon its axel. I’ll give you whatever you want, just make Diesel stop flexing, Cena stop mugging, and the word “family” stop losing all meaning. Between this and Elon Musk, if we have to get rid of all cars, I will proudly climb aboard a Segway or horse or just rollerblade everywhere. Nothing is worth this noisy, vapid futility. I will walk, dammit. I will walk. Maybe only when we are all just pedestrians, this can finally end. 4.) The Flash The buzz for The Flash was everywhere for a very long time. It had stalled in development and was plagued with issues, and the defense was always “But it is so good that it must be seen.” It musn’t! I have seen it, and it absolutely did not need to be seen. Even the post-credit scene is so useless and lame, so without cleverness, that the only thing that can be done for the “DCU” is to nuke it from space and start over. Also, bring Keaton back for a live-action Batman Beyond, you cowards. Rant over. 3.) Iron Claw The Iron Claw is maddening. It has a crucial, salient message that is bungled. If this were a film only loosely based on the real Von Erich boys, its message about the curse of narcissistic Boomer daddies would resonate louder than a stiff-heeled boot stomped in a wrestling ring. That is, provided you overlook the painfully stilted dialogue and the fact that, performance-wise, the High School Musical guy dances The Bear back into the kitchen. 2.) Oppenheimer Even though Oppenheimer is about smart people doing super science stuff, it is stupid. Laughably stupid. Repeatedly laughably very stupid. It has two of the worst sex scenes in history, the second somehow more hilarious than the first. It chops up an inherently compelling narrative into various threads that it then spaghettis into confusing, interweaving timelines with a billion characters and holds the mess up like a toddler making spaghetti art. Dumbest of all, Christopher Nolan becomes the first director to ever make Florence Pugh dull. Forget creating the atomic bomb, neutralizing Pugh may be the most dubious of all human achievements. 1.) Maestro I didn’t write a review for this one, although I was extremely tempted. Biopics are bad and dumb, but this was the baddest and dumbest. It was so insanely cringe-worthy that I can only assume everyone has been nominating it for stuff to avoid telling Bradley Cooper how they really feel. It just seems easier than explaining to him why what he did here was just exceptionally upsetting. Also definitely worth noting that two of the year’s “most acclaimed” films have much awfulness in common. They both cast non-Jews to play historically famous Jewish Americans while warping perceptions of actual people to serve narcissistic purpose. This made me want to go and watch early seasons of Alias again, if only to see Cooper be tortured on screen. I didn’t care for it! The 10 Best Films of 2023 One last thing before we run it up: My honorable mentions were super-duper honorable this year. Click away for my full reviews, but here’s a quick rundown. The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes was still can’t-miss without Katniss. The Boy and the Heron is pure Miyazaki magic that will soon be missed. The Royal Hotel is the best feminist thriller of 2023. Godzilla Minus One made me actually feel hopeful, which is likely why it narrowly missed this year’s mostly brooding top 10. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse only got cut because it’s basically half a (perfect) movie. Well done, all of you! Now get under your desk while I drop some perfectly safe and non-genocidal bombs. 10.) Beau Is Afraid Beau Is Afraid is the funny-sad, gross-gorgeous, obvious-dense oxymoron it billed itself to be. Give me this self-flagellating nightmare that descends into abstract madness a thousand times over before yet-another tepid adaptation that leverages “intellectual property” of whatever household product a mega-corp wants to promote. I’d rather see Ari Aster beat himself up and work through his mommy issues than watch Kleenex: The Movie or whatever is next. 9.) Barbie A hilarious lament on the objectively unfair burden of being a human woman, writer/director Greta Gerwig’s Barbie is as gloriously overt and subtlety-free as its titular character. Any fears of Gerwig and cowriter Noah Baumbach being too precious or clever are quickly obliterated, like tears in the rain or Oppenheimer’s boom-boom. It is proudly on-the-nose, equally capable of winning over both the doll’s devotees and disparagers, and a reminder that Kate McKinnon is the funniest GD person alive. 8.) The Zone of Interest Most movies that focus on despicable, irredeemable vermin take time to consider their side of things. It’s why those films are repellant to me. Nobody offers so much as a fleeting defense here. No backstories are presented. No context needed. This is a shallow couple concerned about conspicuous consumption and comfort, picking ashes of dead Jews from their hair. It is wildly enraging in its dry, dull depiction. 7.) American Fiction As sophisticated as this movie is, as smart as it is, what will linger the longest is how emotionally honest and sincere it is. Having gotten to this one late, after it had received so much praise, part of me feared that the reaction was an overcorrection by the overwhelmingly white world of reviewers (like myself). I worried that the celebration was the critic community saying “You got us!” in a way that would have betrayed the point of the film. Nope. This is just one goddamn good movie. 6.) Anatomy of a Fall Anatomy of a Fall exists to be debated. A vibrant masterwork composed only of gray, it exploits ambiguity to expose our inherent, unspoken prejudices about relationships, gender roles, parental responsibility, and justice. Although much of it is in French, it isn’t aloof in its purposeful uncertainty. It is a mirror shaped like a magnifying glass, sifting through a potential crime for evidence of your humanity. It’s pretty good, can you tell? 5.) Talk to Me With almost no jump scares, Talk to Me opts for “uncomfortable” over “gotcha.” It tells you when it is going to be terrifying, giving an explicit countdown, which is its own kind of spooky fun. It also doesn’t fall into a trap of trying to say too much thematically. It’s not a meditation on grief so much as a literal exploration of the collateral damage associated with suicide. Most commendably, it doesn’t get bogged down in explanations of how things work or some big overarching evil malice at work. “If there are ghosts, we probably shouldn’t TikTok them possessing us” is a simplistic but alarmingly sufficient argument. Good horror movies make you squirm in your seat. Great horror movies make you squirm trying to sleep later that night. The best horror movies make you squirm out of nowhere for days. 4.) Bottoms Most so-called satires lack bite. Bottoms literally gnaws on chunks of flesh and then smiles with bloody teeth. Writer/director Emma Seligman and writer/star Rachel Sennott have somehow interwoven the savagery of Heathers with the hilarity of Mean Girls to answer the unasked question: “What do adults educated entirely post-Columbine, living in an era of open discourse about sexual assault, consider dark comedy these days?” 3.) No One Will Save You SURPRISE! Most of this list is fairly duplicative of stuff I’ve seen on other top 10s from folks. I may be the only critic foaming at the mouth for this one. I didn’t post a review for this nearly wordless Hulu flick, but boy howdy am I a big champion of it. Cool kids still say “boy howdy,” right? Anyhoodle, Kaitlyn Dever runs from aliens creeping in her rural home. Writer/director Brian Duffield does my absolute favorite film thing where a gimmick winds up not being gimmicky at all but wildly authentic and compelling. It even has a thoroughly divisive ending, which I l-o-v-e. Sci-fi horror that highlights showing above telling is always gonna hit'}]"

LONDON — As chances rise of a Joe Biden-Donald Trump rematch in the U.S. presidential election, America’s allies are bracing for a bumpy ride. Many worry that a second term for Trump would be an earthquake, but tremors already abound — and concerns are rising that the U.S. could grow less dependable regardless of who wins. With a divided electorate and gridlock in Congress, the next American president could easily become consumed by manifold challenges at home — before even beginning to address flashpoints around the world, from Ukraine to the Middle East. French President Emmanuel Macron’s recent verdict was blunt: America’s “first priority is itself.” President Joe Biden walks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Feb. 20, 2023, in Kyiv, Ukraine. Concern is rising among America’s allies that the U.S. could grow less dependable regardless of who wins the presidency in November. The first Trump administration stress-tested the bonds between the U.S. and its allies, particularly in Europe. Trump derided the leaders of some friendly nations, including Germany’s Angela Merkel and Britain’s Theresa May, while praising authoritarians such as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. He has called China’s Xi Jinping “brilliant” and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán “a great leader.” In campaign speeches, Trump remains skeptical of organizations such as NATO, often lamenting the billions the U.S. spends on the military alliance whose support has been critical to Ukraine’s fight against Russia's invasion. He said at a rally on Saturday that, as president, he'd warned NATO allies he would encourage Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” to countries that didn't pay their way in the alliance. Trump also wrote on his social media network that in future the U.S. should end all foreign aid donations and replace them with loans. Then-U.S. President Donald Trump, right, meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 7, 2017, at the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that Trump risked endangering U.S. troops and their allies. “Any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the U.S., and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk,” he said in a statement Sunday. Biden, meanwhile, has made support for Ukraine a key priority and moral imperative. But Biden’s assertion after his election in 2020 that “America is back” on the global stage has not been entirely borne out. Congressional Republicans have stalled more military aid for Ukraine, while America's influence has been unable to contain conflict in the Middle East Thomas Gift, director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, said that whoever wins the presidential race, the direction of travel will be the same – toward a multipolar planet in which the United States is no longer “the indisputable world superpower.” Most allied leaders refrain from commenting directly on the U.S. election, sticking to the line that it’s for Americans to pick their leader.

Government Bills 24 and 25 authorize ASUN President Paul Pechous or his designee to testify against both LB 1064 and 1330 on behalf of the student body. ASUN’s Government Liaison Committee, which acts on behalf of the student body to express students' views to all levels of government, drafted both bills. ASUN plans to send a representative to the state capitol on Tuesday to testify against LB 1064 and LB 1330 at the Education Committee’s hearing. Melissa Lee, NU spokesperson, confirmed to The Daily Nebraskan that interim President Chris Kabourek would also be testifying against both bills on behalf of the university system. LB 1064, introduced by Sen. Loren Lippincott, would get rid of faculty tenure at all of Nebraska’s public universities, including NU, Nebraska State Colleges and community colleges. Tenure is a measure to protect academic freedom which allows faculty to pursue innovative research free of corporate or political pressures, according to the American Association of University Professors. Lippincott said he felt that tenure is protecting professors who try to push their ideology on students. “A very long time ago, it was a necessary thing to protect the free thinking of academia,” Lippincott said to The Lincoln Journal Star. “Now, it seems like the professors have more of a freedom to express their opinions than do the students, and the students are expected to regurgitate what the professor’s ideas are.” GLC Chair Luke McDermott said at Wednesday’s meeting that getting rid of tenure would threaten the university’s status as Nebraska’s flagship, land-grant R1 research institution because it would be more difficult to attract and retain faculty and students. According to NU’s 2023 Annual Tenure Density Report (Page 386), system-wide, there are 1,659 tenured faculty with 858 of them at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln as of Fall 2023. At-large Sen. Collin Bonnie, who was the only senator to vote against GB 24 and 25, said he felt that tenure has been abused by professors, especially towards conservative students. “The way I see it, tenure allows a safety net for professors to just do whatever they want,” Bonnie, a junior criminology and criminal justice major, said. The NU Board of Regents Bylaws allows for faculty to be terminated for adequate cause, retirement for age or disability, discontinuance of a program or department or extraordinary circumstances because of financial exigency. The Daily Nebraskan reported last year on a tenured professor who was fired. LB 1330, introduced by Sen. Dave Murman, would prohibit state funds to be used for diversity, equity and inclusion education or training of any sort at Nebraska’s public colleges. Similar bills have been signed into law in several states such as in Florida, Texas and Utah. The senator who filed SB 17 in Texas felt that DEI initiatives force students and faculty to adopt certain political beliefs, according to The Texas Tribune.The Daily Texan reported that organizations relating to DEI at the University of Texas at Austin underwent name changes. The Gender and Sexuality Center closed, with the Women’s Community Center reopening in its place. Sen. Naomi Delkamiller of the College of Journalism and Mass Communications expressed her concerns with the broad language of LB 1330 and how it could not only impact DEI resources but also course offerings at the university. “It was honestly quite frightening. The idea of reporters leaving our college without the ability to talk to, understand or cover marginalized communities is a huge loss for journalism,” Delkamiller, a junior journalism and advertising and public relations major, said. At-large Sen. Emma Lindsey shared Delkamiller’s concerns with DEI training and curriculum possibly going away. Lindsey, a junior child, youth and family studies major, said she felt classes she’s taken relating to DEI were valuable. “It’s really scary to think about being taught by people who do not have the training in relation to DEI,” Lindsey said. “I can’t imagine not only being taught by someone who hasn’t had training regarding this but the university turning out educators who then go out to schools and aren’t aware of or educated on these kinds of issues.” Delkamiller also said that LB 1330 would only worsen the brain drain happening to Nebraska, which is among the worst in the country, according to the Omaha World-Herald. “Nothing is going to make people want to leave quicker than a bill like this,” Delkamiller said. McDermott, a sophomore economics, history and political science major, said that LB 1330 would deter prospective students from coming to Nebraska and impact current students who utilize the resources offered by the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, whose budget was reduced by the most recent round of budget cuts. LB 1064 and LB 1330 are still in committee and would still have to pass through rounds of debate on the senate floor before reaching Gov. Jim Pillen’s desk to be signed into law. The bills come at a time where the dropping enrollment at NU is partly to blame for the university’s budget deficit. The Daily Nebraskan’s political reporter broke down LB 1064 and LB 1330 and other bills introduced in this session of the Nebraska Legislature here. Students who wish to share their thoughts on either bill can submit their comments to the Education Committee on the page for each bill. The committee is scheduled to have its hearing on the bills on Tuesday at 1:30 p.m.. ASUN will hold their next meeting on Wednesday in the Platte River Room in the Nebraska Union. news@dailynebraskan.com Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers:""}]"

The new Douglas County Justice Center at 1717 Harney Street in Omaha on Friday, May 19, 2023. Despite a last-minute attempt to withdraw his no contest plea, an Omaha man was sentenced Tuesday to 90 to 115 years in prison for shooting and killing a teenager in what prosecutors have characterized as a case of mistaken identity. Justyn Wagner, 21, initially charged with first-degree murder in the October 2021 killing of 18-year-old KorVanta Hill, accepted a plea deal last year and pleaded no contest to second-degree murder, use of a firearm to commit a felony and possession of a firearm by a felon. Elijah Robinson, 20, also pleaded no contest to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 40 to 60 years in prison for being the getaway driver. Wagner According to previous testimony from detectives, Wagner and Robinson were driving around the area of 39th and Pratt Streets on the evening of Oct. 18, 2021, looking to shoot rival gang members. Instead, they came across Hill, who was walking through the neighborhood with his stepfather. After circling the pair multiple times, Wagner exited the car and shot at Hill 10 times, striking him in the chest and killing him. Hill was not associated with any gangs, according to prosecutors. Robinson On Monday — one day before sentencing — Wagner filed a motion to withdraw his plea of no contest. According to Douglas County District Court Judge Tressa Alioth, his reasoning for doing so was because he wanted the plea agreement to specify a sentence, which Alioth said was not a sufficient reason to withdraw the plea. Wagner’s attorney, Nebraska State Sen. Justin Wayne, asked Alioth to take a “hard look” at the mitigating circumstances. Wagner “started picking up charges” when his longtime girlfriend died after a four-year battle with a brain tumor, Wayne said. He was convicted of felony marijuana and opioid possession in September 2021 and placed on probation. The lack of support and supervision that Wagner had while on probation is an example of a “systematic failure” in Nebraska’s justice system, Wayne said. Wagner made a tearful statement to the court before he was sentenced and asked for forgiveness from Hill’s family. “I just hope my remorse is enough,” Wagner said. “I’m sorry that everything happened the way it happened.” Hill’s father, Jefferey Johnson, spoke directly to Wagner. Having been to prison himself, Johnson said, he never thought he’d wish it upon anyone else. Losing his son changed that. “My son is gone forever,” Johnson said. “I think everyone involved should be off the street forever. Maybe one day I’ll feel different. But I feel like you should be gone. For a very, very, very long time.” Wagner was sentenced to 70 to 80 years on the murder charge, 10 to 20 years for use of a firearm to commit a felony and 10 to 15 years for possessing a firearm as a felon, all of which will be served consecutively. Without any loss of good time, Wagner will be eligible for parole in 49 years and will be required to be released from prison in 61 years. Get local news delivered to your inbox!

So Lopez rewrote the character and realized she’d also need to rewrite the other detective. “And the script just became better,” Lopez says. “Every time you receive a good note is an opportunity to completely overhaul and take the story to the next level.” Thrilled with the changes, the two-time Oscar-winning Foster signed on and was paired with Kali Reis as detectives investigating the disappearance of eight men from a research station in Ennis, Alaska.

In the latest iteration – a filmed version of the Broadway musical – she adds new lines and a slightly different take. But it’s still about the girls who rule high school. At North Shore High, that’s the Plastics (as they’re not-so-lovingly called by fellow students) who make others fearful of their power. Read more: *** To land a role in “May December,” Charles Melton spent six hours doing a self-tape. “I probably had seven days to do my self-tape and I just dove in immediately,” Melton says. “I was talking with my coach, watching films, talking to my therapist about human emotions….and I completely exhausted myself.” The result was an understated performance that “felt like it wasn’t just the lines I was saying.” Director Todd Haynes gave him a series of notes, urging Melton to show more emotion “because I was trying to show almost nothing.” Read more: *** Leonardo DiCaprio says he felt a great deal of responsibility getting “Killers of the Flower Moon” right. “This was a very dark chapter in American history,” he says of the Osage Nation murders depicted in the film. “We needed to tell the story correctly and that meant we had to listen.” Before and during filming, DiCaprio, co-star Lily Gladstone and director Martin Scorsese sought the advice of the Osage community and pored over considerable research compiled by author David Grann. “The Osage are still affected by this moment in history,” he says. “We just knew it was our job and our responsibility to listen and get their perspective. A lot of those meetings (resulted in) the movie that you see today.” Read more: *** If they’re compiling lists for next year’s Emmy Awards, they might want to include the 75th trophy fest as a nominee for the best variety special. Airing Monday night (after Sunday\'s Critics Choice awards and last week\'s Golden Globes), it faced an uphill battle, trying to get eyes to look at the same people handing out awards to the same people. But, darn, if the producers didn’t pull it off. The program was one of the most entertaining in years. The reason: They brought back stars from old series to serve as presenters. In the process, they recreated some of the shows’ sets, mentioned their Emmy track records and gave the night a bit of nostalgia, particularly for those unfamiliar with the shows that were winning. Read more: *** You can see David Oyelowo’s passion coming through in “Lawmen: Bass Reeves.” In even the quietest scenes, he exudes determination – not unlike the character. Considered a life role for the actor, “Bass Reeves” is an intense look at one of the first Black U.S. deputy marshals west of the Mississippi. Determined to uphold justice, he encounters corruption everywhere and, through it all, remains devoted to his family. It’s almost too good to be true.

Preliminary tests are raising concerns that the nation’s roadside guardrails are no match for new heavy electric vehicles. The University of Nebraska safety research facility and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers crashed a 4-ton EV pickup into a conventional guardrail at 60 mph–which did litt… Melissa with her youngest, Frankie. She’s open to more children, boy or girl. KETV anchor and reporter Melissa Fry Stolinski was dealing with a sick child and getting home in a snowstorm. But even with the challenges that go with working and raising four little boys, ages 7 to 6 months, with her husband, Dan, you’ll seldom find her without a smile on her face. That’s her goal for every day. How long have you been working in the television news industry? I’ve been working with Channel 7, it will be 16 years in June. Before that, I interned at KETV in college. So, 19 years pretty much. Before officially working at KETV, I worked for two years at KLKN in Lincoln. I’m sure a lot of people ask how you do it with four young sons and a demanding job. I have a very, very helpful husband. He’s my rock. I never go at anything alone. My mom and dad are here in town and very helpful, too. I get up at 2:30 in the morning. On the days when my husband is at the fire station overnight, we have a nanny come at 2:45 a.m. Everyone is mostly sleeping until my husband gets home a little after 7. On the days he’s going to work to start a 24-hour shift, she’s there from 6:30 to when I get home about 9:30. I usually go to bed at 8:30 or 9, which is 5 to 5½ hours of sleep, which isn’t the best. I do get a half hour to hour nap in every day. How did you meet your husband? Melissa with the family, from left, Gabe (21), Sam (20), Mikey (7), Ben (4), Charlie (5), Dan, Frankie (then 1 month) and Joe (18). My husband is a firefighter. I interviewed him in 2012 for a news story. Isn’t that funny? I went to Millard South and then the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. I was 31 when I got married. Do you have any specifics on how you get through your day? The way I’m able to do this is I’m extremely organized. I plan out every day. I get home at this time, and I’m going to do this and this. I have to stay pretty disciplined in time management to get a nap in and make sure everything is taken care of. Even on days when I don\'t have a lot on the calendar, I\'m trying to work ahead or organize logistics on future busy days ahead. I think I\'ve always been a morning person. I like the idea of getting up and getting after it. One of the biggest benefits to doing the early-morning shift is I’m home by 9:30. I have the whole day with my family. There is also a sense of personal accomplishment getting up and working on my professional craft before taking care of everyone else. Any advice for others in the same situation? When your hours are odd, your husband\'s schedule is odd and you have kids going to different schools, you have to take charge of routines. You run the day, don\'t let the day run you. Every day I look at the next day. What\'s on the calendar — plan it out — don\'t overwhelm yourself by being unprepared or being subjected to other people\'s chaos. Of course things happen that you can\'t control, but I try to remember the saying ""if you fail to plan, plan to fail."" I would also say simplify what you can. Take the easy route where you can. Evaluate where you\'re giving energy to and re-evaluate. Do I need to do that? For me personally, do I need to go to the store? No. Have the groceries delivered. Do I need to make this amazing meal? No. My kids and I are fine with peanut butter sandwiches. They\'d rather have mom on the floor building Legos with them. And I would rather have those memories. A huge piece of advice — stop wasting time scrolling on your phone. The majority of what you see is useless entertainment. You\'re getting sucked into someone else\'s life, and missing out on your own. Be your biggest advocate. You can\'t be everyone\'s hero if you don\'t champion for yourself. Can you tell I love motivational quotes? Being in the public eye, do you get a lot of reaction when people learn you have so many boys in your life? Enjoying the new riverfront area in downtown Omaha. Yes. Three stepsons and four biological sons. When I am walking around with four little kids, I hear a lot of ""Oh, you have your hands full"" — like having a lot of boys is a bad thing. Or here\'s the worst: ""We hope and pray for you that you get at least ONE girl."" I still hold some grudges over those comments. It\'s as if they want me to say, ""You\'re right, how am I ever going to be able to enjoy life?"" They\'re fools. This is my life. Crazy, hilarious, adventurous, active little boys. My life is not lame at all. There is never a dull moment. And there is never a day that my gut doesn\'t hurt from laughing. If God blesses us with a daughter some day — that would be amazing. If God blesses us with a fifth son, that would be amazing. If God decides we are done, I feel completely blessed, too. Some people look at kids like they are a burden. Not me. I am in no way a defeatist. For me having kids opened up so many doors. I discovered things about myself I never knew and new dreams. I’ve never worked harder or had more personal growth than I have as being a mom. I\'ve done more travel and experienced new adventures. And yes — my husband and I travel with all of the little boys. It can’t be all easy? Melissa celebrates Mike’s seventh birthday during a segment on her show. No. It\'s not always easy. I don\'t try to pretend I\'m perfect. But I don\'t dwell on challenging times. I was raised by very positive parents. They always encouraged my sister, brother and I to go after challenges. As a child, I wanted to be the best softball player, the best swimmer, the best student, the best reporter. That’s all great. Now, I\'m trying to be the best mom — that hits deep. Trying to thrive as a mom is everything. There has never been a goal like this. I’ve never wanted to succeed in something more. I love learning, new adventures and making the most of life. You had three boys in three years. Was that challenge enough? Celebrating her birthday with Charlie, Mikey, and Ben. Frankie hadn’t been born yet. People said you are not going to be able to work, you are done. Watch me. I’m going to do it and do it with a smile on my face and show you. I will be the first to say — I’ve been very lucky. We’re healthy, I have a great family, a great support system and friends. A great job. I worked the grind and long hours for years and I have been able to work a stable schedule for several years. KETV has been extremely supportive. Honestly, when there were days that I didn\'t get much sleep, or one of the boys kept me up, I would tell myself ""So what."" Ok, I didn\'t get a lot of sleep — so what. I just downplay it in my mind. Get over it. Move on mentally. Don\'t dwell. Sometimes it sucks waking up early in the morning. Sometimes it’s a struggle. But I know I have it a lot easier than most, and I don\'t want to take that for granted. You have a routine you say you do every day that gets your mind right. Every single morning on my drive to work, I listen to motivational speeches. Eddie Perino, Les Brown, Jim Rohn. I listen to short little clips. So whatever pity party I\'m having at 2:45 in the morning is gone when I walk into KETV at 3:10 a.m. I\'m constantly coaching myself to be grateful for the day. Work hard. Take care of yourself. I never go through the day without goals. Even if it’s get rooms cleaned and laundry put away. Sounds silly but it gives me something to be proud of. Oh, and I don’t sit on the couch. I\'m a busy body to my own fault sometimes. Would you be able to do this without the support that you have? I think it'}]"

State health officials said a man died from the infection in January in the first known fatality associated with the viral disease. (Jim Dau/Alaska Department of Fish and Game) An elderly man on the Kenai Peninsula has died from Alaskapox, making him the first person to be killed by the viral disease that was identified only nine years ago, state health officials reported. Aside from being the first fatal human case, it is the documented first human infection outside of the Fairbanks area, indicating that the virus, which is known to be harbored by small mammals, has spread beyond the wildlife populations in that Interior community.

With the two strikes overlapping, Hollywood effectively shut down for roughly half the year, delaying or otherwise impacting dozens of film and television projects. As of November, both strikes have ended, and many of the affected productions are on track to hit theaters in 2024. Marvel, which originally planned for a record-breaking six new films to come out in 2024, is now expecting only four. Among those 2024 releases are ""Madame Web,"" the first-ever female-led ""Spider-Man"" spinoff film, and the third installment of the ""Venom"" franchise. Renowned production company A24 has a full 2024 slate, including Mia Goth\'s return to horror in ""MaXXXine,"" Ti West\'s follow-up to ""X"" and ""Pearl."" New offerings from renowned directors like Luca Guadagnino, Bong Joon Ho, and George Miller are also forthcoming. The pressure is on for the 2024 box office to restore Hollywood to financial stability after the combined challenges of the pandemic and the fight to give its workers fair wages. The first four months of 2024 are fairly sparse on new releases, in large part because prolonged labor negotiations set timelines back for films scheduled in the early part of the year. There are, however, a few prospective big hits in those months, including high-profile films like ""Argylle"" and ""Dune: Part Two."" The ""Mean Girls"" musical, which premiered in January 2024, lived up to its anticipation—garnering a $28M box office debut and the number one spot after just three days. Suffice it to say, 2024 is not only an incredibly important year for the future of the film industry but also quite an exciting one in terms of its cinematic offerings.
