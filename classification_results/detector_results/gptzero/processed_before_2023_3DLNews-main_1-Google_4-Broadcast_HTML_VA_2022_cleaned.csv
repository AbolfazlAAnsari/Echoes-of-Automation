snow. For Friday we have watches and warnings for coastal flooding, high winds and frigid temperatures. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph are expected from 6 am until 10 pm today. The result could be downed trees or tree limbs causing power outages just two days out from Christmas. It is likely that the gusty winds could cause category 4 warnings at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge tunnel disrupting travel to and from the Shore. Residents should secure outdoor items including Christmas decorations and drive carefully on our back roads because of the danger of downed trees, limbs and power lines. The wind advisory is from 6:00 am until 10 pm. Friday. Winds are currently forecast to slack off a bit on Saturday with winds around 20 gusting as high as 35 mph near the bayside beaches. There could be a brief period of snow Friday afternoon but it is not expected to be much more than a dusting. In addition a surge of the coldest weather in several years is expected to arrive Friday resulting in expected lows in the lower teens combined with gusty winds creating wind chills near zero. Residents should be aware of the dangers of weather like this. You should drip your cold water to try and keep your pipes from freezing. Pets should be either taken inside when possible or provided with shelter from the wind and cold. Outdoor pets should be provided with unfrozen fresh water. The wind chill warning is from 7 pm tonight until 9 am Saturday. Any power disruption could result in loss of heat and water. Make sure you check on elderly family members and friends. There is a coastal flood watch for Accomack County for Friday. Higher than normal tides could flood roads in low lying areas at the time of high tide. There Coastal Flood Watch (as of 2 p.m. Thursday) is from 7 am until 5 pm Friday. Finally there is a high surf advisory for Friday and heading into Saturday morning. Avoid ocean beaches during these conditions. Things should improve a bit on Christmas day with highs predicted to be around 30 with winds at 10-15 mph.

Bezos, whose “real-time” worth Forbes magazine estimates at roughly $124.1 billion, made the announcement in a joint CNN interview with his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez that was released on Monday. The billionaire didn’t specify how - or to whom - he will give away the money, but said the couple were building the “capacity” to do it. “The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” Bezos said during the interview. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work and very smart teammates. And I’m finding - and Lauren’s finding - that philanthropy is very similar. It’s not easy. It’s really hard.” Bezos had been criticized in the past for not signing the Giving Pledge, the campaign launched by Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates and Warren Buffet to encourage billionaires to donate the majority of their wealth through philanthropy. His ex-wife McKenzie Scott signed that pledge in 2019 and has since emerged as a formidable force in the world of philanthropy, showering charities throughout the country with unexpected - and often secretive - contributions. In the past three years, she’s given more than $12 billion to historically Black colleges and universities, women’s rights group and other nonprofits. Bezos, who divorced from Scott in 2019, stepped down as Amazon CEO last year to devote more time to philanthropy and other projects. Among other donations, he’s pledged $10 billion to fight climate change as part of his Bezos Earth Fund initiative. Last year, he gave $510.7 million to charity, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy. On Saturday, Bezos and Sanchez announced they will give a no-strings-attached $100 million grant to singer Dolly Parton, who’s been praised for her philanthropic work that helped create the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19.
