'Salina radio listeners are saying farewell to a personality they have come to know and love over the span of four decades. Last week, Clarke Sanders announced he was signing off for good as a full-timer at the microphone. The KSAL host of “Friendly Fire,” or “The Clarke Sanders Show,” is moving into semi-retirement status and is passing on the torch for someone else to follow in his footsteps. “It’s kind of an interesting time to be starting this because I am limited on what I can do,” Sanders said. “It’s kind of nice though, I haven’t set an alarm at all. I get up when I get up, and I like that.” Radio days aren’t completely over for Sanders. He will continue to contribute to Rocking M Media through hosting trips and other activities. “Assuming high school sports go back in session I will do the play-by-plays for football and basketball. I still have my desk, my work space and my email, I’m just not there everyday,” he said. “It’s only been a week, so I’m sure it hasn’t sunk in yet, but my life for almost 45 years has been waking up in the morning and sometime during the day going on the air. I miss that, it’s been my life.” While his shows will still air, they will be changed up a little. For Sanders, his own personal show must go on. “I hope to travel some, though that obviously isn’t happening right now,” he said. “I volunteer a lot, so this will give me time to do more of that.” An interesting part about his history with KSAL is that it has had nine owners since its inception in 1937 and Sanders has worked for seven of the nine. In the first nearly 50 years, the station only had two different owners. Then from 1986 until now, it has more than tripled that. “That’s kind of how radio has changed over the years,” Sanders said. Sanders would know. Originally from the Chicago area, he has been in radio since 1975 in Virginia. He eventually ended up in Dodge City before he began his KSAL career in 1985, where he has stayed for the most part, except for a couple of short sabbaticals. For him, radio wasn’t just a job but a legacy. His father was in radio all of his life as well and was later joined on the air by his mother. “I grew up in a radio family,” Sanders said. “It’s been a great ride.” Throughout his career, Sanders met amazing people and had incredible experiences. From interviewing singer-songwriter Ted Nugent to going up in an airplane with a precision parachute team, there was rarely a dull moment. “I like the variety of the different things I got to do,” he said. In any job, mistakes are made and challenges are plentiful, but at least in radio it isn’t the end of the world. “If you make a mistake, nobody dies,” he said. “You have dead air, not dead people.” For instance, when Sanders was hosting a show back in Virginia, it involved reading the obituaries for the day. He didn’t have a record prepared for when the segment was over. So while he was on the air during the show he just reached in and grabbed one without looking. In an ironic and unfortunate coincidence, the song he queued up was a Statler Brothers track in which the first words were “I’ll go to my grave, loving you forever.” This did not go over well, and he spent some time trying to explain that it was unintentional and not an attempt at dark humor. Over the years Sanders has been chosen as the favorite radio host in The Salina Journal’s Best of the Best issue six times. The people and experiences over the years have made his journey fun and memorable. “I’ve always considered myself an entertainer. I’m not dumb enough to think everyone liked me, but I always enjoyed the local people. People would come up to me in public that recognized me,” he said. “The people I’ve gotten to meet, both well-known and not, have always been a blessing.”'}]"

After sharing a Centennial League regular season title, Manhattan High softball netted six all-league selections, including the Centennial League Player of the Year in senior catcher Reagan Neitzel. Manhattan High soccer landed eight players on the all-Centennial League list released earlier this week. The league’s coaches voted on the selections. Despite a pair of prolonged delays, No. 3 seed Kansas State weathered the Arkansas storms and blasted Louisiana Tech 19-4 to open its NCAA Tournament slate across Friday night and Saturday morning. Pressure builds when postseason stakes rise. Constant pressure causes teams to crack. Kansas State found a seemingly perfect fit in transfer forward Achor Achor, a versatile athlete who can play on the wing or as the lone big man and is perfect for the Wildcats’ 5-out offense.

There will be no Red Lobster in Manhattan. Blaming ‘All You Can Eat Shrimp,’ the seafood chain restaurant is bound for bankruptcy or the murky depths, whichever comes first.

The University of Kansas will kick the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity off campus for at least five years after officials determined the chapter hazed members and engaged in “an open culture of illegal drug use,” a document obtained by the Kansan shows. “The types of hazing behaviors seen in evidence demean and intimidate individuals, have the potential for both severe physical and psychological harm, and may negatively impact the academic success of the students involved,” Vice Provost of Student Affairs Tammara Durham wrote in a letter to fraternity members dated Nov. 4. The Kansan obtained the letter through the Kansas Open Records Act. “These behaviors undermine the University of Kansas’ commitment and efforts to establish a safe campus environment and a culture of respect for all individuals,” Durham continued. In a letter from Vice Provost of Student Affairs Tammara Durham, she cites part of the evidence that was filed apart of the student conduct complaint filed that alleged Pi Kappa Phi was violating the student code. The decision prevents the fraternity’s chapter from operating at KU for at least five years starting Nov. 25, when the University will no longer consider it a registered student organization. That is also the day after in-person classes for the fall semester end. The earliest the fraternity could resume operations at KU is spring 2026 or after the last current member graduates. “Breaking the cycle requires an opportunity for the organization to ‘reset’ without current members and leaders who have been an active part of the problematic culture and activities,” Durham wrote. “Closing the Theta Epsilon chapter of Pi Kappa Phi will provide an opportunity for the organization to re-establish itself after current members who led and engaged in a culture of hazing have left the university.” Details are unclear about some activity KU cited, including specifics of hazing incidents. The Kansan requested information from the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards. KU responded by releasing Durham’s letter, which was heavily redacted. But Durham said in the letter that members of the chapter apparently coerced a pledge into illegal drug use and the fraternity had “an open culture of illegal drug use — at least among some members.” Those findings, coupled with hazing allegations, exacerbated the charges, leading to the fraternity’s removal from campus. The Kansan requested comments from Pi Kappa Phi’s chapter president and the fraternity’s international headquarters, but did not receive responses by time of publication. Durham’s letter also revealed that a former chapter president and another unidentified member of the fraternity described the “traumatic” hazing they experienced as new members during the 2017-18 and 2018-19 academic years. KU’s investigation began Oct. 21 and found violations of the student code dating to last November and as recent as this September. A series of messages pulled from a GroupMe chat, video evidence and photos were among evidence turned up in the investigation. Vice Provost of Student Affairs Tammara Durham found the chapter responsible for causing harm to persons and for hazing — both violations of the student conduct code. Pi Kappa Phi’s national assistant executive director represented the fraternity in its disciplinary hearing with KU. The national official submitted a document to the hearing board with suggested sanctions for the KU chapter that were “endorsed by the national fraternity,” Durham said in her letter. KU Student Conduct and Community Standards Director Katie Treadwell said she could not disclose details that were redacted in Durham’s letter. But Durham’s letter makes clear the incidents that led to the punishment were not isolated. “Due to the active members participating in these hazing behaviors and the participation and knowledge of Pi Kappa Phi chapter leadership in these behaviors, the hearing panel determined, and I agree, the behaviors were pervasive within the organization and conducted with the full knowledge of the organization,” Durham wrote. On Nov. 5, the day after the fraternity received news they were being kicked off campus, dozens gathered in the chapter house's parking lot. On Nov. 5, the day after Pi Kappa Phi received Durham’s letter, members of the chapter hosted a gathering outside the chapter house, located at 1505 Sigma Nu Place, criticizing KU’s Interfraternity Council, known as IFC. From the roof of the house, the fraternity hung a banner that said, “Fuck IFC.” Have you been hazed or know someone who has? Contact the Kansan by emailing nasbury@kansan.com or lpeterson@kansan.com.

He has been the Superintendent of Forewinds for almost 29 years. Alvin Riley presented Rick with a gold watch in appreciation for all the years and hard work that he has put in at the golf course. He also presented Rick with an aerial picture that shows the many improvements that have been made over the past years that Rick has been Superintendent. Next John Akers presented Rick with a candy dish which looked like a giant water sprinkler. Rick began his job as Superintendent in 1992. Over the years, many trees have been planted and a lot of grass has been planted and replanted by Rick and his crew. Rick and his wife Eunice plan to play a lot of golf in the future. They also plan to travel as well grandkids. May you have a great retirement Rick!

If you are a motorist wanting to pass a KDOT truck plowing snow or putting down salt or brine to fight ice, you might not realize why it is moving so slowly. It comes down to physics and performance. Fact, the physics: A KDOT plow truck weighs around 26,300 pounds – and that’s unloaded – while the average vehicle weighs about 4,000 pounds. The KDOT operator is trying to keep all that weight under control in slippery conditions while pushing snow with a plow in front and maybe a wing plow on the side. That’s a lot of force exerting from different directions to keep under control. So the operating speed for the plow truck in those conditions is well under normal highway speeds — and may be as low as 10 mph when a blizzard cuts visibility. Just because the truck is so heavy doesn’t mean it won’t lose control on ice or packed snow. Click to view the best deals in Hugoton and Stevens County. The Community Guide 2022-2023'}]"

Angelo Canazza takes a selfie in front of Rally House in Aggieville, where the Little Apple dropped for New Year’s Eve. Thousands of people celebrated a new year and a new decade Tuesday night by watching the “little apple” drop successfully after glitches during the previous two years’ festivities. Aggieville was abuzz with people counting down the final seconds of 2019 as the apple — Manhattan’s version of a ball — dropped atop Rally House at midnight Wednesday. Confetti flew, and many people kissed their loved ones to signify the start of 2020. Manhattan residents Raeann Magill and Ben Sachs were among the revelers. The couple rode their bikes to Aggieville to watch the apple drop. It was their first time. “I mean the reason we came out to Aggieville was for the apple drop,” Sachs said. “It’s kind of the reason to come out tonight. We’ve been spending all day moving into a new house. Celebrating a new step in our lives.” Enterprise residents Diane Dugan and Samantha Wittig made the 40-minute trip to Aggieville with their kids to ring in the new year. Dugan said she hopes for peace in the new year. Wittig said the best part of their new year’s eve celebrations was dancing at Kite’s with one another. DJ Dan Michaels of radio stations Q Country 103.5 and Power Hits 97.5 provided some of the party music in the background and helped pump up the crowd. “It’s fun,” he said. “Seeing the people come by, you know all the different things going on in Aggieville. You got so many different things to do in Aggieville. So that’s kind of the fun part, seeing how the event spaces are used.” “It’s just a lot of fun,” Michaels said. “Getting rid of a year, getting rid of a decade, so why not have a little fun?” Michaels said he looks forward to growth as Manhattan moves into a new decade. “2020 ... I don’t know, I’m looking for fun. Looking for more fun things to do in Manhattan,” he said. “Building the live event, not just the music, but live event scene. I’m looking for Manhattan to grow. I’m looking for Aggieville to grow, downtown to grow. We’ve got such a great gem here right in the middle of Kansas. I’m really looking forward to Manhattan growing.” Dennis Cook, executive director of the Aggieville Business Association, said he wanted this year’s event to bring in more people than just bar hoppers. “We’re hoping we’re attracting a bigger, wider audience,” Cook said. He also hoped people were able to discover the atmosphere of Aggieville entering into the new year. “I guess I would hope they’re going to see that Aggieville’s got a lot to offer for the general public,” Cook said.

The people of Kansas appreciate its agricultural traditions and friendlier, slower pace. Food, such as barbeque, is a community event in Kansas. Even though there are plenty of wide, open spaces, Kansas also has bustling, modern cities for residents, such as Topeka, Wichita, Kansas City and Lawrence. One of the draws of living in Kansas is the inexpensive lifestyle. Although it's true you'll pay a little less for groceries, transportation and other goods in this state, some residents still struggle. Earning top dollar in a state that is mostly known for farming isn't feasible for the average Kansas resident. One way some people in Kansas help get through a month where money may be tight is to take out a payday loan. Here are some details about how payday loans work in Kansas and information for people who are considering taking one. Kansas residents who are thinking about taking out a payday loan should know all of the rules and regulations of this industry. Kansas began regulating the payday loan industry in 1993 and passed legislation. In 2004, the regulations were updated. Currently, in 2019, lawmakers are considering adding more rules to the industry. Here are the things you need to know: If you need a payday loan in Kansas, the most you're legally allowed to borrow is $500. It's possible to have two loans outstanding at the same time, but no more than that. Rollovers aren't permitted in the Kansas payday loan industry. If you take out a payday loan of $100 on a 14-day plan, your finance charges will be approximately $15. APR for your loan can reach as high as 390%. State lawmakers are considering adding legislation for the future that would cap the interest rate at 36% for payday loans in Kansas. The state requires that the finance charges for payday loans must not exceed $15 of your paycheck. Extensions are not allowed for your payday loan in Kansas. The terms for loans in Kansas range from seven to 30 days. If you don't pay as agreed, your lender is allowed to charge a collection fee for the loan. Lenders aren't required to give you a reasonable repayment plan and refinancing of a payday loan is not permitted. The good news is that consumers are protected in Kansas from facing criminal penalties if they don't pay back their loan. We're working hard to restore the reputation of payday loans, cash advances and other short term lending services. We believe that all kinds of people should have access to the financial products which can help them to deal with unforeseen expenses even if they have less than exemplary credit records. Unfortunately, the reputation of payday loans in Kansas has been marred by less than reputable lenders who prey on the financially vulnerable. If you've made the informed decision to take out a payday loan you can do so safe in the knowledge that Snappy Payday Loans can help you do so in the safest way possible. Remember we are not a payday lender. Instead we put you in touch with the right payday loans direct lenders in Kansas to suit your needs, helping you to make a well informed and zero-obligation decision that's right for you and your household. People who turn to payday loans may be living from paycheck to paycheck. Workers from all different industries in Topeka, Kansas City or Wichita may consider using a payday loan if they can't pay their bills on time one month. It's more common for lower income people, such as blue collar workers, retail employees and restaurant staff to take out payday loans. Even though the cost of living in Kansas is low, prices for everyday goods and other big-ticket items continue to rise. Additionally, a setback, such as a pricey car repair bill or an unforeseen home expense can be frustrating if you're on a budget. Payday loans can help someone stay afloat. The first time state lawmakers took steps to regulate the industry and help keep consumers protected was in 1991. The state legislation attempted to pass laws to limit interest rates and help consumers not get in over their heads for payday loans, but the bill never got out of the Senate. In 1993, state lawmakers in Kansas were finally successful at passing the first bill to help regulate the payday loan industry. Kansas was one of the first states in the country to take this step to protect consumers. The new law capped interest rates, limited the amount of money consumers could borrow and set a ceiling for finance charges. In 2004, the Kansas state legislature went back to the law and amended it with the new, current regulations. It set a loan term minimum for seven days and a maximum for 30 days. Only two loans were allowed to be taken out at a time, according to this new set of regulations. Lenders were also required to keep detailed records from borrowers. Payday loans are also monitored through a state database. The OSBC Division of Consumer and Mortgage Lending in Kansas is responsible for recording information about the payday loan industry in the state. All lenders are part of the database and must update their information regarding license numbers and the location of their company. As of 2015, there were 11 online lenders in Kansas, 65 payday loan companies in the state and 326 individual locations for payday lending. In 2006, the federal government passed new laws for military borrowers. The Military Lending Act also impacted the payday loan industry in Kansas. Borrowers who were serving in the military can't be charged more than 36% interest. Additionally, it is illegal to garnish wages for a member of the military if the payday loan isn't being paid back on time. During a deployment, any type of collection or repayment can be put on hold. Since 2004, there have been a few attempts by the state legislature to change the payday loan laws, but most of these attempts have not made it past committee or the Senate. Lawmakers attempted to limit the number of consecutive payday loans to five with the same company in 2007, but that bill never passed. In 2010, a bill failed that would tack on an additional $1 to each payday loan to help the state raise more revenue for programs. In 2015, the state tried to put more regulations on the industry to help senior citizens and cap interest rates for this group at 36%, but that bill didn't make it into law. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau enacted new regulations in 2016 for the payday loan industry that should go into effect in 2020. These nationwide regulations will also impact Kansas payday loans. First, the lender will be responsible for making sure the borrower can afford to pay back the loan before signing off on the paperwork. Borrowers may also not take out more than three consecutive loans in a short period of time. The borrower's debit account for payment must also not be used after there are two unsuccessful payment attempts. This helps a struggling borrower avoid pricey bank fees for insufficient funds. In the future, Kansas lawmakers are proposing to set the interest rate at 36% for all payday loan consumers. This interest rate cap could help lower the cost of getting these loans and make it a more feasible option for many people struggling with paying their bills. It can also help the most desperate borrowers avoid getting into the cycle of overwhelming debt. The key to making payday loans work is to only take out the amount of money you need and to use them sparingly. Payday loans shouldn't be taken out on a consistent basis. It's also important to consider credit counseling if you are regularly having trouble paying your bills each month.

Updated: June 1, 2024 @ 5:16 pm Labette Health CEO Brian Williams visits with Labette County commissioners, meeting as the board of health, Monday at the Labette County Health Department. Labette County commissioners, meeting as the board of health, heard reviews from 2019 from the Labette County Health Department staff in Parsons Monday afternoon. Brian Williams, Labette Health CEO, talked about clinic and hospital operations and Medicaid expansion in Kansas. He said in the calendar year ending November 2018 hospital clinics had 65,000 visitors. In the calendar year ending November 2019, the clinics had 81,000 visitors. Home health visits increased by 2,000 in that same time period, Williams said. The hospital is planning on $15 to $18 million in renovations that will offer more private patient rooms and account for patients not wanting to share bathrooms. “We’ll spend a little bit more money, but I think you’ll be proud of the product when we’re done,” Williams said. He said year to date the hospital made $2,265,849. Some may want the hospital to lower the cost of care, he said, but the hospital works as a not-for-profit and reinvests those profits in improved equipment and facilities. He said a new DaVinci robot will cost $2.4 million. A new nuclear medicine machine costs $230,000. “As much as we have a bottom line, we reinvest back into the hospital, too, the real estate and the equipment you own,” Williams said. In the same time period ending in November 2019, Williams said Labette Health had $9,368,215 in bad debt. “That sounds huge. Remember hospital charges all across the United States are sort of inflated,” Williams said. “What’s realistic? Probably $3 to $4 million of that was collectible in the first place.” The hospital provided charity care valued at $1,843,000 in that period. Williams also discussed Medicaid expansion that the Kansas Legislature is going to take up again in the 2020 session that began Monday. “That’s huge for all of us in public health and the hospital,” Williams said. He’s still trying to get a clear understanding of how the proposal to expand Medicaid will impact the hospital. The projections are that expanding Medicaid will bring health care to 150,000 Kansans who are not now covered by medical insurance. That number may change depending on how many Kansans actually sign up for the coverage. Transportation may be an issue for these newly insured families to get to medical appointments. “Medicaid expansion will be a wonderful thing, but a lot of people in this room will have to invest a lot of time and effort to help teach people how to get access to those programs,” Williams said. Board member Fred Vail asked Williams what impact expansion will have on the hospital’s charity debt. Williams said it’s still too early to have accurate numbers, but expansion could reduce uncompensated care by $900,000. Hospitals are to add a surcharge to help the state get money to pay its share of expansion, but Williams is waiting to get more accurate estimates on this cost that will be passed on to hospital patients. Other reports: — Charles Morse, the county’s sanitation officer, said he did 30 real estate inspections in 2019 for lagoons or septic systems. He issued 14 new permits and wrote six enforcement letters when systems failed. He inspects sanitation systems in the unincorporated areas of the county yearly. — Health Department Administrator Lisa Hoppock briefly discussed department work on an opioid grant, car seat program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) in 2019. Angie Hammack, licensed practical nurse, said she attended a three-day training session on becoming child safety seat certified. She plans on having the first of two child safety seat checkpoints at the health department in March or April. She has installed seven car seats. Susie Jones, registered nurse and WIC coordinator, discussed WIC, though participation numbers were not available. Labette County has operated its own WIC site since October. — Hammack said there are 48 licensed group or preschool centers in Labette County, down about 20 from a couple of years ago. She did 12 orientations in 2019 for people considering opening day cares and she did 51 complaint or compliance checks of day cares. Fewer day cares mean that parents have a wait list for good child care in the county and only a few spots open for infants in day cares. — Janelle Weider, registered nurse, discussed communicable diseases. She said tick-borne diseases numbered 113 in the county in 2019. The county also had a single tularemia case in 2019. Childhood diseases such as pertussis, mumps and measles are making a comeback because some parents refuse to vaccinate their children. Dr. Sonya Culver said younger generations haven’t heard of destructive polio or measles and they do not think vaccines are important and so don’t vaccinate their children. “Our younger generation are firm believers that these are not necessary. And that’s why we’re seeing the uptick in these diseases because they are not vaccinating their children,” Culver said. Weidert said the syphilis outbreak that was reported in 2018 was no longer considered an outbreak in Labette County in 2019. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment will have a disease investigation specialist located in Pittsburg in late February to investigate syphilis and HIV in Southeast Kansas, she said. The chances of a sexually active person getting a sexually transmitted disease by age 25 is 50%, she said. Kansas had nine congenital syphilis cases in 2019, when a baby was born with syphilis, and two of those were in Southeast Kansas between June and December 2019, she said. Hoppock said that’s significant because in the last 10 years Kansas didn’t have any congenital syphilis cases. The board of health also approved one-year contracts with Culver, medical director for the health department, and Tracy Gilmore, pharmacist for the department. In other business, commissioners in Oswego: — Approved routine resolutions to begin the new commission year. Lonie Addis will serve as chairman and Fred Vail will be vice chairman. The commission adopted a list of 10 holidays for the calendar year. The commissioners named all banks in the county for possible depositories for county funds. The commission named the Parsons Sun as the official county newspaper. Next year, the Labette Avenue will be the official county newspaper. — Agreed to move forward with The Home Store removing tile in the hallway and other areas of the jail in the spring or summer at a cost of $16,542.50. The concrete underneath the tile will be sanded smooth and cracks in it will be sealed before an epoxy coat will be applied to it. Some tile received water damage. Inmates may be moved outside in the enclosed recreation area of the jail during the work in case the fumes get too bad. There is no tile in inmate cells. — Approved resolutions appointing Greg Rankins as Mount Pleasant Township clerk and Vicky Haraughty as its treasurer. Haraughty resigned as clerk to seek the treasurer’s position. Perry House had resigned as treasurer. — Met with County Counselor Brian Johnson in closed session to discuss attorney-client privileged information.
