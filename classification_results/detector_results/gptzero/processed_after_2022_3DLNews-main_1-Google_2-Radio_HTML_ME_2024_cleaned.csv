The smallest town in America is in Maine. After randomly searching where the smallest town in the country is, I was shocked to find many towns listed. It\'s not clean-cut, and there\'s room for speculation. That is because there are a few ""towns"" that are only populated by one family. For example, according to a Country Living article, there is a town in Alaska called Hobart Bay that only has one resident. Similarly, there is a town in Maine that also only has one sole resident. And that town is tiny, tiny. Like, less-than-one-mile tiny. According to a NewsWeek article, the smallest town in America is Hibberts Gore. The town only covers an area of .752 square miles. Shocked about this news, I had to follow up where everyone does: Wikipedia. Sure enough, according to the Wikipedia page: According to the United States Census Bureau, Hibberts Gore has a total area of 0.752 sq mi (1.95 km2), of which 0.745 sq mi (1.93 km2) is land and 0.007 sq mi (0.02 km2), or 0.9%, is water.[2] The water is primarily wetlands, part of Sheepscot Pond, which is the headwaters of Sheepscot River. That is not even the wildest part. One person, not a family, is on this land. How does one person have ""ownership"" over their own town? According to Newsweek, the land was ignored by the surveyors who mapped Maine. Gallery Credit: Megan Gallery Credit: Ginny Rogers'}]"

""He\'s from Syracuse, right?"", and ""Was he in Boston a while back?"" were questions that came up, but nobody really knew his New England history, if any. All we knew was he has a dog named Axel and geeked out over Keith Urban. Muir is at the top of his game hosting ABC\'s World News Tonight, the most-watched newscast in America. He had big shoes to fill, following previous hosts Diane Sawyer and Peter Jennings. But, was he ever a reporter in Boston? No one in this conversation was sure. Muir is humble about his beginnings, though, and quick to point out that his hometown TV station near Ithaca, New York, is where it all started when he was just a 15-year-old intern. He then went to Ithaca College, studied in Spain, became fluent in Spanish (which helped him with his all Spanish interview with Pope Francis in 2015), and was hired at his local television station WTVH, in Syracuse, New York, in 1995, according to The Famous People. From there, he caught the attention of WCVB Boston executives, where he was a TV reporter from 2000-2003. He covered the 9/11 attacks from a Boston angle, the Boston Marathon at Heartbreak Hill, the Tall Ships, and the Old Man of the Mountain collapse in New Hampshire. Check out this early reporting by David Muir. David Muir won an Edward R. Murrow Award for his work on the 9/11 hijackers path through New England on WCVB, Channel 5. He looks back fondly on seeing beloved anchors Chet (Curtis) and Nat (Natalie Jacobsen) on the set during his time at the Needham station, according to WCVB-TV Facebook page. In 2015, Muir delivered the commencement speech at Boston\'s prestigious Northeastern University. He was also in New Hampshire to cover the Democratic National Debates at St. Anselm College in Manchester in 2015. There is so much negativity with news outlets, but Muir seems to strike a chord of truth with his audience. Maybe it\'s because he is reminiscent of epic news anchors of the past like Peter Jennings (ABC) or Walter Cronkite (NBC), whom many grew up with. Those anchors had the ability to relate to everyday Americans in a trustworthy and calm way. Making the local connection to a nationally respected journalist is all I\'m trying to do here, because as we all know, Boston is called ""The Hub of the Universe"" for good reason.
