The response is overwhelmingly racist. How?\nIt seems as though the marches in the streets over the last few years, the death of young men and women live streamed on newsreels and social media, the consistent and vile excuses by Blue Lives Matter enthusiasts for their reckless endangerment and murder of Black men and women seemed to have missed the ears of the Olympic officials.\nThe ongoing media attention on mental health of football players has been swept under the rug as these professional athletes are killing themselves in dramatically similar consequences at an alarming rate. When tennis phenomenons like Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka refuse to be talked to and bullied for their very real circumstances as Black women, or when Simone Biles chose her overall wellness required to compete at a level that no one has matched, they are advocating for the right to safety and consequential mental health protection. As if these are situations that are just moments in time — these are, in fact, the voices that can be heard, but they are still being treated as if they are whispers in the wind.\nWe agree that representation matters, so as more and more events in the Olympics are joined and dominated by women of color, needing to adjust to the realities of such representation seems natural. Why aren’t they ready? What is the pushback about?\nIf the answer is, “Well, the swim caps aren’t usually made like that, and it isn’t within regulations,” then what does it mean for a cap to fit Afro textured hair to be out of regulation? Wearing one could disqualify you. You could be fined.\nWhy are women’s beach volleyball uniforms so revealing? Gymnastics as well, for that matter? There’s a fine for not complying with the standard uniform. When the #MeToo movement is a household reality, and sex trafficking is a drill we make sure our middle school daughters are aware of, why is it hard to imagine equity in men and women’s choice to show or not show their bodies while competing?\nTo have this conversation and expect attention on the matter, we have to make a statement, we have to push back on the establishment, we have to cause a scene to disturb the “norm.” These statements are just to open a conversation for those who are questioning whether or not the “establishment” is inherently racist, or inherently sexist and just basically refusing to reconfigure to the current and modern time of self determination for the greater good.\nThe problem is, the people pushing back are seen as the underdog, and that is inherently false. We/They are not the underdog. We/They are historically excluded.\nHow loud do we have to scream before the institution makes a change willingly, before we march, before we refuse endorsements and take our fan support and dollars elsewhere?\nWho really, what really, is causing a division? At what point do we, as a collective, stop funding the institution that willingly ignores the very people the institution stole their glory from? Without us — who are they?\nLook, I’m just trying to watch the Olympics, man.\nAyisha Elliott’s podcastBlack Girl From Eugeneis raw and uncensored monologues and conversations about living while Black in the PNW.
