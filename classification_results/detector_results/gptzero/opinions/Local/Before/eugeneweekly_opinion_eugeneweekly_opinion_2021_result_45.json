Instead, it has tried to sell the city on continued infrastructure expansion and a series of fanciful technologies including “renewable” natural gas and “green” hydrogen.\nThese technologies are not a silver bullet for emissions reductions, nor do they address the myriad public health and justice issues surrounding the extraction and combustion of methane gas. Rather, they are merely a distraction as NW Natural works to keep the gas flowing under our homes and ratepayer money flowing into the utility’s coffers. And NW Natural is committed to locking in as many customers as it can, offering cash incentives to switch to gas and working non-stop with the American Gas Association to fight climate policy at all levels of government.\nAfter two years of failed negotiations, it is clear that NW Natural is more interested in protecting the profits of its shareholders on Wall Street than it is in protecting the communities it claims to serve. And after back to back climate disasters, there is no time left to waste negotiating with the fossil fuel corporation. We need to take bold action to regulate these companies and transition our society to clean renewable electricity right now.\nEugene has never been better positioned to be a climate leader in Oregon. Our City Council can be the first in the state to pass common-sense climate policies to transition our homes and buildings off of fossil fuels and mandate that new construction be built 100 percent electric. This is a critical step for reducing climate-polluting greenhouse gas emissions, as the use of methane gas in buildings has been the fastest growing source of GHG emissions in the city and the state over the past decade.\nEugene is not alone in considering these policies: As electric appliances become more efficient and affordable, there has been a wave of cities passing policies to mandate electrification in new construction, and developing programs to retrofit existing buildings. As of last month, 50 cities in California alone have passed some form of building electrification policy.\nPolicies to encourage electrification are especially important in light of developments at the state level. The passage of a suite of environmental and social justice bills spearheaded by the frontline-led Oregon Clean Energy Opportunity Campaign, including a landmark bill which requires electricity providers in the state to supply 100 percent renewable electricity by 2040, Oregon is leading the way to a clean energy future.\nNow, Eugene can build on that momentum, and set a precedent for cities across the state to take full advantage of the clean energy transformation sparked with the passing of the 100 percent legislation. The council must pass an ordinance to mandate all new construction be built with clean electricity, and begin developing a plan to equitably transition our city’s existing building stock off of fossil fuels, while prioritizing low-income and Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) households and creating good paying union jobs in the process.\nDylan Plummer is an organizer working at the intersection of climate and social justice issues and a co-founder of the Breach Collective, an organization fighting for a just transition off fossil fuels.\n"
