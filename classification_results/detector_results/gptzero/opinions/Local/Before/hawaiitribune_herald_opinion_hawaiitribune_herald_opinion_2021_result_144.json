Through partnerships developed in the fight against HIV/AIDS and other diseases, the U.S. in particular can help train and pay the armies of vaccinators needed to put shots into arms. Countries will need technical assistance to track initial shots, make second appointments, and monitor and quickly investigate any adverse reactions.Combined, those efforts should help developing nations reduce friction and reach those willing to be inoculated. The more difficult task, as rich countries have themselves found, is overcoming deep-seated suspicion of COVID-19 vaccines.That effort needs to be intensely local. Wherever possible, authorities should work with community groups, particularly churches and womenâs organizations, to assuage doubts about the vaccinesâ safety. Public campaigns should be tailored to local conditions and delivered on the platforms, particularly social media and messaging services, where disinformation is most rife. Rising hesitancy should be monitored closely and rumors quashed quickly. Where cash incentives might help, international financing should be made available.Finally, rich-country governments shouldnât wait to address looming problems. They should be working with manufacturers to increase the supply of raw materials needed to produce COVID-19 therapeutics, including promising new treatments from Merck & Co. and Pfizer. Donor nations should fill the gap in funding for surveillance and tests, which need to be widely available for those pills to be useful. And they should head off an anticipated shortage in syringes that could undercut vaccination efforts in 2022.Admittedly, if vaccines do need to be tweaked for omicron, prompting a new wave of inoculations, itâll be hard to keep rich nations focused on these priorities. They should remember that unless far more of the world is vaccinated soon, those wonât be the last shots theyâll need.The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.
