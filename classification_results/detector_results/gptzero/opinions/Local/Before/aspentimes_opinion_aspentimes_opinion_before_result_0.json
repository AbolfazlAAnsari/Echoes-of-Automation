And, it’s not hyperbolic; my genuine wish for Snowmass Village is, and always has been, that we remain aggressively aware of our priceless natural connections, of our unique character, and that we respect the magnitude of our human impact on this valley. And, that we do it together.\nIf you have read stories preserved inThe Story of Snowmass(Our history book that I helped to co-create) or any of the years of columns I have penned in theSnowmass Sun, then you may have some idea of where I stand on many Snowmass Village issues. My beliefs and values have held fast. If it’s worth saying, it has probably been said.\nAnd, in my own written words over the past seven years, I submit from theSnowmass Sun:\n“In the midst of change, these grand vistas hold fast: Mt Daly, shrouded in mist on a bluebird day or backlit by an intense gradient of hot pink and burgundy hues, the early morning blue-gray shadows sculpting the landscape across a crystalline carpet of fresh white snow, and the unparalleled panorama of peaks that swaddle our valley.\nSo many of us live for that beauty.”\nThink big, stay small\nFeb. 17, 2021\n*****\n“For many of us, our immediate natural connections are the very reason to forge ahead and work way too much. That work-life imbalance has always been offset here by wide-open spaces and exceptional recreation opportunities.”\nTectonic shifts\nMay 2020\n*****\n“For me, the questions remain: Are we staying in concert with our original vision, our own mission statement? Cautiously eyeing our roots as we look forward, I hope we will remain aware of the scale and character of our small village.”\nBack and forth\nDec. 19, 2018\n*****\n“We ought to continue fostering an authentic small-town atmosphere of boutique businesses and local restaurants rather than adding more glamorous offerings for an indulgent luxury lifestyle.”\nTourism’s footprints\nMarch 16, 2022\n****\n“Aspen was born in the age of mining, while Snowmass Village has the raw roots of a ranching community.”\nRodeo our timeless western tradition\nJune 23, 2021\n*****\n“History, coupled with innovation, determines the new paths on which we will someday find ourselves.”\nIt’s OK to reinvent the wheel\nSept. 19, 2017\n*****\n“The connections that our collective memory creates lay the true foundation for what we endlessly strive to become.”\nThese are the good old days\nJuly 25, 2017\n*****\nThese sounds, these feelings, this energy; it’s all about the context of our relationship to our environment. Perhaps an urban solution is not needed to solve a simple, small-town problem.”\nA little more conversation, a little less action\n\n*****\n“Once that building goes up, or that sidewalk is laid down, it’s not going away.  We must remind ourselves that, every time we add something, we take something else away. Let’s tread lightly; we don’t want to pave paradise.”\nWhere the sidewalk starts\nJuly 24, 2019\n*****\n“People are drawn to fun, the genuine kind that you can’t contrive, plan, market, or schedule. Let’s pay homage to our roots, and have fun — for fun’s sake.”\nThose days of fun for fun’s sake\nJan. 19, 2022\n*****\n“The late John Bemis, namesake and founder of our Thanksgiving Community Potluck, left a legacy that stretches far beyond our annual tradition. He recultivated a piece of our thriving sense of community, as we join together, sharing each other’s company, food, and ideas.”\nGiving thanks\nNov. 14, 2017\n*****\n“A human story is unfolding on our rocky, snow-covered mountain every day. What lies within — we’ll call it our heart, our essence — is not confined by our physical body.”\nChallenge Aspen: The heart of Snowmass\nJanuary 2016\n*****\n“What will Snowmass Village look like one day? Will we miss the mark and obstruct the landscape, or settle in harmony within the vast natural beauty that surrounds us?”\nScaffolding our future\nFeb. 13, 2018\n*****\n“Like the mistakes of yesterday, the mistakes of tomorrow will belong to all of us.”\nDo it once and do it right\nAug. 17, 2022\n*****\n“If development is done with mindful consideration, our human impact can blend into our environment and come to even feel in harmony.”\nCall it a facelift?\nSept. 25, 2019\n*****\n“Character is an intangible thing, but we know it when we see it, when we feel it; and, as long as it exists here in Snowmass, it is our job to preserve the magic, the dream, the vision.”\nIt’s the “Vision Thing”\nAug. 10, 2016\n****\n“Well done is better than well said.” Those are not my words, that was Benjamin Franklin, but I agree; so, please help me put my own words into action. It would be an honor to represent our community voice on council.\nBritta Gufstafson is running for the Snowmass Village Town Council in the Nov. 8 election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, "
