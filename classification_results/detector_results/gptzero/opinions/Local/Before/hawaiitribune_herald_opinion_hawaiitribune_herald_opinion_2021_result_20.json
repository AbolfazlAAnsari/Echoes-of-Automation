Providing more information and training on how to use the Ashlynne Mike AMBER Alert in Indian Country Act, which makes federally recognized tribes eligible for AMBER Alert grants and integrates regional AMBER Alert communication plans with tribes across the nation, is one path to consider.Improve websites for the reporting of missing Indigenous persons.
