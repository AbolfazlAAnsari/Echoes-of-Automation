There were others with greater urgency who couldn’t find an empty bed because those were taken by the foolishly unvaccinated.I mourn all whose conditions worsened or who died because of this.If you’re refusing vaccination because you don’t trust science and medicine, then at least be consistent and stay out of the hospital. Think about it. A hospital is the citadel of science and medicine. I repeat: The Citadel of Science and Medicine. Put this on a Post-It, and slap in on your forehead.And if you are among the unvaccinated who want to be injected with Ivermectin, used by veterinarians to treat heart worm in animals, then also steer clear of hospitals. While Pfizer, Moderna and J&J vaccines are approved by the FDA, deworming medication to treat COVID is not.Therefore, enter not the Citadel, but instead, get thee to the nearest veterinary clinic. I know a good one, if you need a referral.To those who remain unvaccinated because they distrust modern medicine, I say this: Be true to yourself. When you get sick, do not report to the hospital, because this is a place where science and medicine culminate. Either you trust it or you don’t. If you do, get vaccinated. If you don’t, stay away. It’s a clear and honest choice.I want to stop writing about this pandemic, so if we all do what’s pono, maybe we can come out of this.Rochelle delaCruz was born in Hilo, graduated from Hilo High School, then left to go to college.
