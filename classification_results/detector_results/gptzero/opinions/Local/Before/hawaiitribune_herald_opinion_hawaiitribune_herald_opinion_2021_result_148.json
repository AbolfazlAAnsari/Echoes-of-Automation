With so much unknown about omicron, make the odds work in your favor. A person with a boosted immune system is less likely to catch COVID-19, far less likely to become seriously ill or die, and also far less likely to spread the disease to friends, relatives and loved ones. That’s enlightened self-interest at work at the individual, micro level. But it’s your call.The omicron variant, first reported in South Africa, is already spreading across the globe. The first case was identified in the United States on Wednesday. It appears to be easily transmissible, but we don’t yet know how dangerous it is or how effective current vaccines are against it. Researchers are working on those answers right now. It’s time to be prudent but not to panic. We can already guess one thing: By the time omicron was detected, it had already spread far beyond where we knew it was.The emergence of yet another variant — let’s hope we don’t run through the Greek alphabet naming them like we do in some busy hurricane seasons — proves that no nation is an island. Travel bans may slow the spread, but they can’t stop what has already happened. And they can inadvertently punish the very countries that are candid and alert world health officials as soon as they were aware of what was happening, as South Africa was in this case.We live in an international world. So instead of pretending that the Atlantic and Pacific oceans somehow will keep the coronavirus and its variants far away, the United States should treat vaccinating people in other nations with more urgency. It’s a pandemic, after all. So long as so many people around the world have limited access to vaccines, the coronavirus will exploit vulnerable populations and hop from person to person, with every new case presenting the opportunity for mutations that could create yet another variant, one that is a mere jet flight away from us. We’re all tired of the pandemic, but the coronavirus doesn’t care what we think. It has already killed more than 786,000 Americans.It’s in Americans’ interest to help vaccinate the world and thereby to protect us at home from more variants. Whether on the personal or planetary level, enlightened self-interest offers a useful guidepost. Let’s look out for ourselves and for others. Sometimes, it can be one and the same.— Tampa Bay TimesThe Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.
