It is a win-win model, propelling changes in care across the nation.\nIt has been clear to many that mental health support is in great need both locally and around the country. We’ve seen folks who wouldn’t otherwise be in jail but for the lack of mental health care. We ache for parents whose children are sent out of the community for crisis care due the gap in services for youth. The pandemic has brought stress and strain for all of us and touches each person in different ways.\nMental health care is for everyone and makes our whole community safer and stronger. Please join me in championing mental health care, reducing its stigma and supporting our community. ν\nHeather Buch, Lane County Commissioner, East Lane District 5\n"
