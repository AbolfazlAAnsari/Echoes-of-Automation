Sea levels are rising, which will wipe out coastal cities. Glaciers are melting and warming seas will harm peopleâs livelihoods. Whole species will cease to exist.But the good news is that the rest of the world was already worried by the science and didnât completely pull back from climate change concerns.So in this season of tiny little shards of hope sparkling on the horizon, there should be new confidence that that Biden White House understands that climate change is a monumental threat and one that we must deal with. That is no longer hyperbole.The new U.S. goal is to make the country carbon neutral by 2050.
