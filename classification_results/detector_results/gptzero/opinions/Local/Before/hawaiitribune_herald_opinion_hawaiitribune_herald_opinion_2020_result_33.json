This year, we have seen the fragility and futility of all those hopeful “this year I will” goals set in January. I wonder how holiday cards can render the heartbreaking absence of loved ones. Will this year’s cards — delivered postelection and pre-inauguration — have markers of political joy or anger? Can any card show what it feels like to see an elderly parent only through the window of an assisted-living facility?The holiday photo card seems akin to the college alumni magazine entry, often just about highlighting accomplishments. Where are the pithy comments about job loss or breakups? Illness or deep disappointment? Perhaps that’s just not the point; it’s not the place to reveal a raw or unphotogenic moment.There was an intriguing article in the Wall Street Journal last year about how the holiday card has evolved — and the visual language of announcing life changes without words. What counted as a breach of convention, such as revealing illness by not hiding medical equipment, showed how strongly the boundaries have been set for smiling kids and perfect backgrounds.This year offers a moment to peel back from the code of visual perfection, allowing us to reveal our flaws. During one emotionally dark winter when I was trying to get pregnant and not succeeding, I stood by a trash can and tore into tiny pieces the holiday cards that “announced with joy” a baby’s first Christmas or Hanukkah. Then I cinched up the trash bag and took it outside. Even the torn scraps seemed to hurt me, lying like fallen puzzle pieces, representing something I so badly wanted but didn’t have.This year, there will be no pictures of children on Santa’s lap. And I hope, for once, my friends will put themselves in the frame and not just let images of their kids stand in for their whole family. Since I can’t see my friends in person, I want to at least see them in the photos. Let this year be the one when we’re all in the picture, as our disheveled, beautiful, surviving selves.I’m sure there will still be some wind-swept beach scenes, at least in Southern California, where a photographer can shoot this scene from afar. But I’m hoping the 2020 cards show the kind of dour honesty this year has forced on us. We’re using our porch portrait and letting our unsmiling faces be what represents us. I’ll write a hopeful message but acknowledge how bad things have been.Honesty never was the point of the holiday card, but there is unity in a shared experience of isolation and anxiety. Maybe the pandemic will have lessened our need to pose on all levels. Maybe in this year’s photo greetings, I will see friends and family telling me, “This is where we stood and waited for this to pass.”Elline Lipkin is a research scholar at the UCLA Center for the Study of Women and teaches creative writing for Los Angeles Writing Classes.The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.
