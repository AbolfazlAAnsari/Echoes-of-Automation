But DCEs are allowed to operate with very loose restrictions on how much of their revenues must go to patient care. This incentivizes them to limit payouts by rationing care and keep even more than the 15% that Medicare Advantage programs are allowed for their own profit and overhead. This detail alone should alarm taxpayers.\n\n\n\nAs this is a creation of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services’s “Innovation Center,” this pilot program can be scaled up to cover all of Medicare without so much as a vote or hearing in Congress. Very few Members of Congress appear to be even aware of its existence or its existential threat to Traditional Medicare.\nTo prevent Medicare from becoming completely and stealthily privatized, this program must be stopped in its tracks. The only way to stop it is by order of President Biden or insistence by enough Members of Congress.\nPlease make it your New Year’s resolution to help the millions of seniors and Americans living with disabilities who depend on Medicare, bring this nefarious program to a quick end. Please contact U.S. senators Hickenlooper and Bennet and your Congressional representatives and implore them to instruct Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to terminate the Direct Contracting program immediately. The Capitol switchboard at 202-224-3121 can connect you with the office of any elected official.\nMost seniors love Medicare. It is simple, efficient, and empowers them to manage their health. Traditional Medicare has proven its value for more than half a century. Rather than sell it off to the highest profit-driven bidder, we should strengthen and improve its benefits while working to expand it to cover every American.\nDr. George Bohmfalk is a retired neurosurgeon in Carbondale and a member of Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP.org).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
