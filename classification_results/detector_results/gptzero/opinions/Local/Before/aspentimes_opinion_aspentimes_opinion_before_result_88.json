Considering those factors, it is not a surprise that delivering culturally competent services to our growing Latino population is also a challenge — but it is a challenge that, if properly addressed, can lead to improved health outcomes and thriving communities.\nA culturally competent mental health system would include providers who are bilingual and can relate to the community being served. It would start with an understanding that many, many of the residents who live among us have experienced countless traumas — from fleeing civil wars, gangs or poverty, to harrowing and often violent and desperate journeys to cross the border, and then arriving in the U.S. to face isolation, discrimantion and so many inequities — that are difficult for many of us to comprehend.\nIncreasing access to mental health service was “strongly supported” by 93% of Latino community leaders surveyed as part of the 2021 Colorado Latino Policy Agenda. That survey also identified that  89% of Latino adults in Colorado support increasing access to mental health services.\nWe may never know for certain what would prompt a parent to harm their children — or a nephew to kill his aunt and uncle — but we do know that we can do more to improve mental health services in the region — particularly for Latinos.\nA one-size-fits-all approach to addressing mental illness simply does not work.\nWith mental health services in our community coming under greater scrutiny, join me in calling on health care advocates and providers to be more thoughtful of the diversity of our population — and the experiences that affect our mental well-being — moving forward.\nThis will not be an easy endeavor for an area that struggles to attract mental health professionals and provide services — but it is critical to the safety and well-being of the community.\nAlex Sánchez is the president and CEO of Voces Unidas de las Montañas and Voces Unidas Action Fund, two Latino-created, Latino-led advocacy organizations working in Lake, Summit, Eagle, Pitkin and Garfield counties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
