A decision of such magnitude and consequence rests with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative body.”\nRoberts tips his hand when he puts ‘crisis of the day’ in single quotation marks as though this were an annoying issue raised by some instead of the literal threat to all life on Earth that it is.\nWe are ina climate emergency. Just go to Denver this week and see how you feel.\nWhat this case is about is a systematic plan to constrain the executive branch of the federal government and hobble its capacity to protect American citizens from dirty air, polluted water, consumer fraud, banking scams, hazards in the workplace and threats to public health.\nThis radical, unaccountable majority of Supreme Court justices is trying to usher in a dystopian future when companies can more freely trash the environment, prey on citizens, let them die from preventable workplace accidents and contract the host of new diseases that are appearing in the world.\nIt is a wholesale giveaway to corporations to let them run amok.\nAnd yes, it is corporations that are the ones really pulling the strings of this new majority on the Supreme Court. Overturning Roe v. Wade or allowing prayer by a coach on the football field (and how is that “private speech?”) are just sops to the far-right Christians who vote and elect those who are turning the country over to the corporations. Whencorporations have the rights of “personhood” and women do not have rights about their bodies, you know that has to be true.\nI havewritten that the Supreme Court overturning Roe meant that there would be “free states and unfree states.”\nBut there is no such thing as a “state where you are free to breathe and not die of heat stroke and ones where you are not.”\nWe are all connected as one country and indeed one planet. Coal plants polluting the environment in Kentucky mean it is over 100 degrees in Denver.\nThe idea that we are one nation, one body of citizens whose government should be able to protect them, is literally under attack from the six radicals on the Supreme Court.\nThe Rev. Dr. Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite is president emerita and professor emerita of Chicago Theological Seminary. She and her husband now make their home in the Vail Valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
