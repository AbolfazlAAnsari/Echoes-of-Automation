Quarantines exact severe economic and emotional tolls on working parents, who must scramble to secure childcare or make last minute arrangements with their workplace so they can stay at home with kids.\nThis past year has taught us that kids need to be in school, where they learn best and are happiest.  In general kids don’t mind wearing masks and are excited to interact in person with their masked peers.  The alternative of staying at home learning remotely has resulted in a silent pandemic of isolation, depression, anxiety and screen addiction.  We understand that it is not ideal to teach with masks on.  However, it is much more difficult to teach and make connections with children via zoom or google classrooms.\nThe pandemic is not yet over, and everyone is exhausted. We can all take off masks when we can keep our children safe and in school.  Until then, the masks need to stay on.\nThis is not an official letter from the Board of Health, but has been endorsed by these members individually: Dr. Jeannie Seybold; Dr. Christa Gieszl; Dr. Tom Kurt; Dr. Kimberly Levin; Linda Vieira; Ann Mullins; Markey Butler; and Greg Poschman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
