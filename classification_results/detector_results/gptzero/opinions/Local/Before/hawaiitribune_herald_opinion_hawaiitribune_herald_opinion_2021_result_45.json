It’s not always easy to know fact from fiction and right from wrong. So, here are the facts as we know them:• COVID-19 is a highly contagious infectious disease; new cases are expected to surge through the holiday season and omicron is even more infectious.• The 2021-2022 flu season has seen notable increases in flu activity, the majority in young adults and children.The 2020 flu season saw historically low infection, hospitalization and death rates, likely due to strict COVID-19 prevention measures.
