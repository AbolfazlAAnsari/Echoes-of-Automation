What “liberty” have we not already lost, held hostage as we are by ever-morphing levels of technological “advance”?\nWhen confronted with millions of confirmed COVID deaths worldwide, anti-vaxxers either ignore or downplay the facts. The figures are inflated, they say; only old people die. What thousands of health care folks around the world continue to report is nothing but lies, they claim.\nOne of the most head-scratching aspects of this phenomenon to me has been the hate mail I’ve received for not being anti-vaxx. These screeds have come from individuals whose work on the critique of society, on the crisis and what drives it, I’ve much valued! Some in this camp, of all people, have attacked me as a fake anti-authoritarian for not drinking their conspiracy-theory Kool-Aid.\nThis is how far critical thinking has declined in some quarters. Frankly, my dear, I’d prefer to live to fight another day.\nZerzan is a local anarchist writer, whose books includeElements of RefusalandFuture Primitive.
