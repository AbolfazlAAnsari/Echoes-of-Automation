In hisMourning and Melancholia, Freud pondered the depth of personal bereavement. He wondered why “each single one of the memories and hopes” that is connected to the lost loved one “should be so extraordinarily painful.”\nThis past March, the American Psychiatric Association declared prolonged grief a mental health disorder. The implication would seem to be “just get over it.” A misguided and misinformed response to Rebecca Cadenhead’sHarvard Magazinequery, “I have been wondering what I’m supposed to do with all my grief.”\nIn Megan Devine’s eloquent assessment, “the way we deal with grief in our culture is broken… We see it as something to overcome, something to fix, rather than something to tend or support,” she writes in her bookIt’s OK That You’re Not OK: Meeting Grief and Loss in a Culture That Doesn’t Understand.\nLocal journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday.\nMichael Cholbi may be helpful, with his “There is Consolation in a Philosophical Approach to Grief,” published inAeon, July 22, 2022. He discusses grief as a way to understand loss, asserting that “not experiencing grief at all [would be] worse than experiencing grief.” In this stricken world, Max Horkheimer wrote, we become “more innocent” through grief. We apprehend a reality deeper than the everyday realm of the commonplace, the symbolic.\nInEarth Emotions, Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht sees the environmental crisis as an opportunity to foster new feelings in place of all-too-prevalent depression. Equally grounded is Darcia Narvaez’s short filmBreaking the Cycle, which draws upon our thousands of generations living in face-to-face band societies, before domestication. She refers to our heritage of cooperative community, compared to today’s dominant outlook of competitive detachment. A transition is clearly needed, for ours is a time not only of post-traumatic stress disorder but of ongoing stress disorder. In the words of Ward Churchill, “We can’t achieve the healing until we stop the wounding.”\nTo me the silver lining, the grounds for hope, is that people are realizing that the system we live within — a global civilization — is broken. When we see how much is needed, each of us may wonder what we can do. But this awareness can be liberatory. Each one of us has a contribution to make. I see people coming together, seeking to find healing ways forward. We need to renew the face-to-face, and draw on Indigenous knowledge and life-ways, past and present. Events, gatherings, conversations, creative expressions emerge; an encouraging energy.\n"
