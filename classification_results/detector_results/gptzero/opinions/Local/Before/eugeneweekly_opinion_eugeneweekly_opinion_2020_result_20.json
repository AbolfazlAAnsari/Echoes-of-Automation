We may even decide, eventually with trusted supporters, not to pay for the Pentagon’s war budget by omitting the amount from our tax payment that the Pentagon receives — a whopping 50 percent or more of what we pay in federal income taxes.\nThis year we can also rally around anarticulate and educational resolution introducedbyLeeto cut $350 billion from the Pentagon budget and redistribute that hard-earned taxpayer money to meet the needs of everyday Americans.\nLee notes that last year’s Pentagon budget ($738 billion) was the “largest on record” and adds, “The prioritization of defense spending and the underinvestment in public health has led to 10 times more deaths from COVID-19 than the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.” She is joined by 28 House members and at least two senators.\nOne of those senators is Bernie Sanders. “We need to cut our military budget by 10 percent and invest that money in human needs.”\nSupported by Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, as well as Lee and Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin from the House, Sanders’ proposal “would take $74 billion in annual savings from the Pentagon — exempting salaries and health care — to create a domestic federal grant program to fund health care, housing, childcare and educational opportunities for cities and towns experiencing a poverty rate of 25 percent or more.”\nBoth of these initiatives can be the start of a national conversation to reroute money from death and destruction to life-enhancing programs. For decades, groups of citizens across our country and in our community have found ways to protest and/or refuse the use of their tax dollars for war and preparation for war.
