Get thee to LEOWeekly.com!And now, since you now have a better idea of how we work, also keep your eyes out for a new film column that will break down the films and film festivals that you should be seeing and some other content partnerships that will bring you the best of local arts and entertainment.LEO has been loved and supported by Louisville for so long. Your eyes, your talkbacks, partnerships, and print and digital advertising have carried us through. Damn it, we still need you — so stay involved, buy an ad, send us flowers (I just want some) and talk to us when we make you laugh, or cry, or piss you off. LEO is very uniquely Louisville and we want to keep it that way but we don’t do this alone.Last thing: LEO has volumes and volumes of old issues, so don’t be shocked if you see a few flashbacks coming your way. Most aren’t digitized (yet), so you might be getting the best-of-cell-phone captures of some old but memorable LEO content.502 4 Life.•Keep Louisville interesting and support LEO Weekly by subscribing to our newsletterhere.
