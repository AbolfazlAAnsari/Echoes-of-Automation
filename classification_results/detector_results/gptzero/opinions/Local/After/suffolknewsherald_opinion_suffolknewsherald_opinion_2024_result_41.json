Frog! ….Frogger!….Froggy!As a young boy I would often hear that greeting offered to me as I’d come out of the patch of woods near my hometown Little League field in Pine Grove, Pennsylvania, especially from the members and close associates of the Culbert Family. They’re good folks who, to this day, would cast aside any other name or title I have to call me some form of “Frogman.”You see, while I was in those woods, I was often at a very small creek trying to catch frogs.

Now, to paint a better picture, this was back in the days when you wore sneakers and jeans to play at that level. Your uniform consisted of a decaled t-shirt, and what is now called a “trucker cap.” Sports drinks weren’t available to us. We were fueled on Swedish fish, Big League Chew, hot dogs and Mountain Dew.
