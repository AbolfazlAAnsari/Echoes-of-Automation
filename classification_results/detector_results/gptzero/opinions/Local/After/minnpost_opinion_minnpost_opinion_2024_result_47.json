By acknowledging uncertainty when it exists, the physician can engage the patient in additional history taking, leading to a better differential diagnosis.I’ve had 19 years to think about it: what will make for safer diagnosis in health care? I believe it will require a world where providers consistently lead above all with humility and curiosity; where they value uncertainty as an invitation to slow down and dig deeper; where they acknowledge any uncertainty to their peers on the medical team, revisiting the initial diagnosis if needed; and where they communicate clearly and honestly with the patient and family. Expressing uncertainty with care and reassurance can be a trust-building practice.Julia was, in most ways, a normal 15-year-old, alternately engaging and distant, delightful and maddening. She had a fairly normal childhood experience with medicine: a few stitches here, an infection there, a shard of plastic in her eye, and assorted athletic injuries. In adolescence, she experienced depression. She worked hard in therapy and became an outspoken mental health advocate at school and among her friends. She had much left to give.Julia trusted her doctors and was a compliant patient throughout her week in the hospital. She wanted to come home, and surgery was seen as the ticket out. Tragically, the inflamed gall bladder was only a symptom of an overlooked Epstein Barre infection — mononucleosis — and internal bleeding post-surgery was fatal.My wife and I do what we can to shine a light on diagnostic safety. There is movement, but there must be more — with patients, families, educators and professionals on the same page — to make health care safer for all.Dan Berg, of Minneapolis, is an advocate for patient safety."
