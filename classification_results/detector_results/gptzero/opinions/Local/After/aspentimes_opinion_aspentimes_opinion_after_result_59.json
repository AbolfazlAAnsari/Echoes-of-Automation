An additional $700,000 has gone toward upgrades and maintenance to existing housing stock. An additional $36 million from the bond proceeds is budgeted for employee housing, which may include the construction of new housing.\nAbout $4.6 million is being invested in important safety and security upgrades districtwide this summer and fall. The upgrades will facilitate more informed and timely security decisions and help provide a safer learning environment.\nReplacing outdated plumbing, HVAC systems and roofing.\nTo extend the useful life of the district’s existing facilities, approximately $18.5 million is being allocated to deferred maintenance projects. There will be a big push this summer to address many of these projects, with some of the first upgrades to include the Aspen District Theater and work in every building on the Aspen School District campus.\nImproving classrooms, science labs, libraries and performing arts spaces.\nMinor renovations in each building will occur this summer and into fall as the district works to update and improve instructional spaces. The work occurring for the balance of 2022 will be a partial expenditure of approximately $6 million, which is also shared with creating flexible and adaptive learning environments.\nCuningham Architects is working closely with school principals and staff in planning for instructional space upgrades, including replacing outdated furniture at each school, beginning in the summer of 2022. Approximately $933,000 is allocated for the furnishings ordered for this year alone. Many classrooms will be affected positively by this investment.\nAs a part of various sustainability initiatives, an active study to provide photovoltaic (PV) panels on our building roofs, over parking areas, and in open spaces is underway. That work could begin as early as this fall with ongoing improvements installed through 2023. The district has purchased four electric buses and new charging stations at the bus barn. Through a grant from AltFuels Colorado, a partnership between the Colorado Energy Office and Regional Air Quality Council, about 87% of the cost of the buses and charging stations will be reimbursed. This will help further stretch the bond proceeds.\nThe district and its partners could never have projected the extent to which construction costs would increase as a result of supply chain issues and other factors. As a result, the district has had to make hard choices on what to scale back. One project that has been put on hold is the complete rebuild of the Cottage preschool. In the meantime, the district will be working to identify funding solutions to deliver on the promise of a new early childhood education facility.\nThe district is committed to continuing to provide project updates and addressing any questions you might have regarding the 2020 bond projects.\nWe appreciate your continued interest and support as we work together to provide our students with the best possible learning environments.\nDavid B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging Director White Elephant Aspen White Elephant Resorts is now accepting applications for the position of Managing Director of White…\nSeeking FT Operations Manager for high end homecare division of Hansen Construction.
