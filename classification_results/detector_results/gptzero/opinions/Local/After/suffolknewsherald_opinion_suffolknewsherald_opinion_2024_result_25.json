A story that is eerily familiar to Suffolk News-Herald staff. Those of us who were here in 2020 experienced what it was like to be put on an unknown path by a tornado.During tropical storm Isaias, the historic building on Saratoga Street where Suffolk News-Herald had resided for decades was hit hard by a tornado, displacing our entire operation in the blink of an eye. Desks covered in ceiling tiles, gaping holes in the roof in the back of the building, and front windows blown completely out and clear across the street — the building was devastated. Our home away from home, where we spend eight hours or more out of everyday life, was destroyed.Where would we go? What would happen next? These were all big unknowns for us but one thing was clear: readers of the Suffolk News-Herald would still receive their papers that week. Through all of this, we never missed a paper. The press stops for no one, not even a tornado. Thankfully, with the help of some friends within the community, we quickly found a new temporary home at 157 N. Main Street to set up shop and resume normal office functions. It’s a special feeling knowing that the community that you serve will come to your aid.

Though we will not be on Main Street anymore, we are still nestled in the hustle and bustle of Downtown Suffolk. We will still be available for walk-ins at any time during office hours. Simply pull into the parking lot behind The Center and park near the wooded area. If you look toward the back of the building you’ll see a red loading door and a pergola to the left of it. Walk down the short path, next to the lovely bushes to the open patio on the right. There you will find our new offices’ double doors and there we will be — ready to serve you and continue to provide you with top notch local journalism and marketing solutions, as we have been since 1873.
