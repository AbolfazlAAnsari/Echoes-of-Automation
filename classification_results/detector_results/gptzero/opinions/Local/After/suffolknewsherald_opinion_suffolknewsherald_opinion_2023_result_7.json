It is this freedom that sets others free and independent. Yes, it’s this freedom that perpetuates liberty, democracy, justice, equality, peace and order, and the rule of law for everybody.July 4 is an annual national holiday celebration of freedom and liberty, a commemoration of the United States of America’s Independence Day, from England, for all Americans both here and abroad. It’s also celebrated by non-Americans who are freedom-lovers and keepers, and taxpayers, and who have lived here and/or her territories outside of the contiguous United States for years, awaiting for their immigration paperwork or documents to be processed or approved to become naturalized U.S. citizens.There are people serving in the U.S, Armed Forces who are not yet citizens. They’re permanent residents, though. I believe they also want to be U.S. citizens someday to fully serve, defend and protect her while they continue to contribute to and help shape America’s future. That’s commendable. They do what they can to help protect and preserve the freedom they so cherish and enjoy. They’ve served and are still serving in the military. Others have died in defense of this nation.There are veterans of different wars and conflicts who have never waivered their support and conviction of protecting our country and her allies. They and other public servants have pledged their allegiance to serve America and defend her liberty and freedom without reservation.These freedom, liberty, independence, justice and equality, and the pursuit of happiness are embodiments of democratic values in the United States of America. These are what make America a beacon of hope, a paragon of all that is great, ideal, beautiful and powerful.In celebration of America’s 247th Independence Day, I recall an immortal speech from a Virginian-American lawyer, planter and politician turned famous orator Patrick Henry, who said, “Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forgive it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.”Happy Fourth of July!-Chris A.
