It’s a good start, but it’s not nearly enough.A fairly and fully funded network of public defender offices is the only way to make sure every Pennsylvanian has a fair chance to navigate the criminal legal system.Hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians are impacted by the public defense resource crisis per year. They are the people who spend extra time incarcerated while they wait to be assigned a public defender, in jails wheredrug deaths and overdoses can run rampant. They are the public defenders whowork tirelessly to represent an overwhelming number of clients. They are the children whose parents unjustly sit in jail. They are the spouses who struggle to make ends meet while their partners await their day in court. And so many others.This lawsuit isn’t just about making sure Pennsylvania is following the law. It’s about preventing the unjust and unnecessary suffering of so many Pennsylvanians as a result of a broken system.Veronica Miller is the senior policy counsel for criminal legal reform at the ACLU of Pennsylvania.
