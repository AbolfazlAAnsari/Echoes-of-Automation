In January 1996, the City Council adopted a false alarm ordinance in response to the extra burden on emergency service units due to increasing incidents. Fees can be levied by the fire and police departments for false alarm calls. If the fire department responded to a false alarm, charges were assessed based on the fire equipment, vehicles and personnel involved according to the time the units were in service until they were available for other calls. A warning was issued for the first false alarm call, while service fees were tagged on for each thereafter.The city got an updated bridge in April. Replacement of the North Broad Street Bridge ended the 72-year existence of the original bridge. The structure was originally constructed in 1924 on the heels of an agreement between the city, Virginia Railroads and the Coastline Railroad Co. to close a gap between Broad Street and the old Pitchkettle Road grade crossing. Approximately 3,300 vehicles used the bridge daily, according to Public Works Director Thomas G. Hines. Features of the new bridge included concrete and steel ‘Very much like the appearance of the Kingsboro bridge,” said Hines. With a slightly higher elevation than the former present structure, the replacement bridge was wider with pedestrian lights.In June ’96, an interview with James McBride, author of “The Color of Water,” put Suffolk on the map of readers. McBride said that he often visited Suffolk while drafting this tribute to his mother, Ruth McBride Jordan, and the accompanying story of his and 11 siblings’ lives growing up in the Red Hook housing projects of New York.In Aug ’96, supporters of a local businessman’s quest to keep his property – despite the city’s intent to demolish it to make room for a $14 million court complex – protested the groundbreaking ceremony downtown. The groundbreaking included dignitaries such as City Council members, former Virginia Gov. Mills E. Godwin Jr. and the judicial community. William “Bill” Beamon owned “Hot Spot Record & Tapes” on East Washington Street, one of about 10 businesses that were targeted with the wrecking ball to make room for parking around the 95,000-square-foot, tri-level building. However, Beamon was the only property owner to challenge the city legally.In the fall of ’96, the United States fired a hailstorm of cruise missiles at Iraqi air defense sites. The strike came 12 hours after President Clinton warned that a defiant Saddam Hussein must “pay a price” for his boldest aggression since the Persian Gulf War.As school began, a report from Washington, D.C.-based Physicians Committee For Responsible Medicine indicated that most of the nation’s schools serve much higher fat content meals than they should.
