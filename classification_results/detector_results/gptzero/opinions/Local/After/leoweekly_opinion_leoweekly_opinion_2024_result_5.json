The spectacle was something that my twelve year old brain did not think was possible.

This event was real and it was open to the public to see, visible representation of what I NEEDED to feel included and seen and not feel so different and alone. Of course this opened me up to search out other events when I was old enough to venture on my own and find people like me.In 1997, I even had the opportunity to hold the lead parade banner in my hometown of Louisville, KY. It was called “The March for Justice and Pride Parade”  back then. There was no Kentuckiana Pride Festival until 2001.Every year, in June, I have attended a Pride festival or more, traveling to near by festivals, such as one of my favorite spots, Columbus, OH. I always looked forward to  public and fairly-safe space that was provided for me to hold my girlfriend’s hand or kiss the one I love. And the year that same-sex marriage became legal, I found my special person. And ever since then, my family and I have made it a tradition to attend Pride Festivals in the area, such as the very family-friendly Southern Indiana Pride and of course my own Kentuckiana Pride Festival.Fast forward to 2024, my wife and I take our twelve year old son to the Kentuckiana Pride Parade. We normally watch the parade from the side lines and cheer for all the fun floats that scream “Love is Love”  “Protect Trans Kids” “God Loves Gays.”We love seeing Louisville Youth Group and Fairness with their rainbow balloon wings. We feel safe to accept “Free Mom Hugs” from strangers who are allies marching along side the floats. There is so much excitement to see SO many people like me and where the LGBTIA+ community is visible to everyone. My family and I usually purchase inexpensive tickets at the gate after following behind the parade.This year, the tickets to the festival were capped and sold out days before the festival. So, many of the queer families, like mine, were unable to enter the festival. Outside of the chain-linked fencing, I spoke with  several friends, including one of my trans friends who said , “It feels like we are being thrown back into the closet.”  (Referring to being denied entry to our very own gay pride.)I even spoke to a group of young queer young adults, dressed in their best rainbow and glitter gear, toting rainbow balloon wings given to them.
