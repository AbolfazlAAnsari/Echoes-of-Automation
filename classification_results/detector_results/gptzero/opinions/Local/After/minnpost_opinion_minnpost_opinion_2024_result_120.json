Three-and-a-half years earlier, he had scored one of the greatest landslides in American history, winning 61% of the vote and 44 states in the1964 presidential election.A scant few individuals so aptly defined the term “political animal” as LBJ. He had come to Washington as a young man bursting with ambition and succeeded like few others.Indeed, since becoming president afterJohn F. Kennedy’s 1963 assassination, Johnson had ushered through Congress anavalanche of progressive legislation, including the historic 1964 Civil Rights and 1965 Voting Rights acts. With the possible exception of Franklin D. Roosevelt, no other president had achieved so much legislatively.But on that March day in 1968, at a time of growing antiwar protests and theaccelerating pull of rival candidatesfor the Democratic nomination, he understood that he now led a country coming apart at the seams. Despite having declared his candidacy for reelection, seeking another term might make things worse.It was time for someone else to have a turn.As one of us recounts in his book, “A Supreme Court Unlike Any Other: The Deepening Divide Between the Justices and the People,” President Barack Obama invited Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for a private lunch at the White House in the summer of 2013.Obama wanted to nudge Ginsburg into retirement. The 80-year-old justice was a two-time survivor of pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest of all cancers. She had already served on the high court for two decades and had carved out a legacy as a staunch liberal and champion of women’s equality.Additionally, Obama was concerned about the upcoming midterm elections. If the Democrats lost the Senate, he would not be able to replace her with a like-minded justice, because a GOP-run Senate would not confirm such a nominee.Ginsburg didn’t take Obama’s hint.Soon after the lunch, she noted, “I think one should stay as long as she can do the job.”She added shortly after, “There will be a president after this one, and I’m hopeful that that president will be a fine president.”That next president was Donald Trump.Ginsburg died in mid-September 2020, just weeks before Joe Biden would oust Trump from the White House.

Not strong enough. Not tough enough. A former walk-on who had beendrafted in 2011 in the sixth round.But in a short space of time, Jason Kelceredefined the position of centerand helped guide his team to its first-ever Super Bowl win.In 2024, Kelce’s team, the Philadelphia Eagles, was still one of the best in the NFL.
