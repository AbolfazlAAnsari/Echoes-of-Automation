A short drive from Redwood Falls, Suss strategically held this event during Farm Fest, a sort of kickoff for statewide politics. In addition to visiting with neighbors and enjoying sweet corn and savory hotdishes, you could expect to see a Who’s Who of Democratic statewide and national office seekers.On that day, an unknown Walz gave his first stump speech. He was seeking Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District seat. His speech is the only one I remember. He spoke about America and American democracy with total authenticity. When he spoke about citizenship, he mentioned the rightsandthe responsibilities. For Walz, democracy survives and thrives when we all work for the common good. It is that work that makes us free.Like any good educator, Walz had become skilled at the lessons he shared. I left the corn feed thinking Walz would flip that congressional district and one day might become president. His ability to speak optimistically about the promise of democracy was simply phenomenal.Since that day, I have followed his career with care. In 2018, as Walz was seeking the DFL nomination for governor, hesought the endorsement of my union. Speaking to our board of directors, Walz immediately put us at ease by noting that, like us, he had been a union educator for many years. He then went on to tell us why he decided to seek office in 2006.He recounted a now well-known story of a rally he attended when George W. Bush visited Mankato in 2004.As I recall the story, Walz was recently back from deployment with the National Guard and had invited two students to join him to see the president of the United States. While in line he noticed that one of his students was getting some pushback from Bush campaign security for having a John Kerry sticker in his wallet. Walz approached the security person and said that the young man was his student, that he would be sitting with him, and there would be no trouble. The security guard was unimpressed and refused the student entry, and then refused Walz entry.Walz asked security if they wanted the headline in the next day’s paper to be “Command Sergeant Major denied entry to see his Commander and Chief.” Upon further reflection, Walz was let in, but his students were denied access. The next day, Walz’s students asked him what he was going to do about that, and it was during that conversation, in a public-school classroom, that he decided to run for Congress.He then shared with my union his decision to attend Camp Wellstone, a kind of bootcamp for politically minded citizens. There he learned the Wellstone way of politics: focus on authenticity and on improving people’s lives. His trainer was Peggy Flanagan, now his lieutenant governor and the country’s highest ranking Native American woman elected to executive office.After his presentation, we were sold and became the first union to endorse Walz for governor.Like so many skilled educators, Walz has an uncanny ability to read the room he is in and to shift effortlessly from deeply held identities as a teacher, coach, soldier and father with perfect sincerity.There is nothing fake about him.He isdeeply rural, having grown up in sparsely populated Nebraska and then moving to a regional center in Minnesota some 90 miles from the nearest significant airport. Deep down, Walz has rural roots and is comfortable living in small towns.And yet, Walz is also profoundly cosmopolitan. As a young man he received a fellowship from Harvard to become one of the first K-12 teachers from the United States to spend a year in the People’s Republic of China. Walz’s experience in rural China led to a lifelong fascination with that nation. He started an organization that sent dozens of Minnesota students to live in China. His National Guard service took him to Europe and elsewhere. This cosmopolitanism helps explain why this son of the plains taught world cultural geography in addition to social studies.Tim Walz believes in government. Like most Americans, government has worked for him. He was educated at public institutions, served in the military and worked as a union teacher in public schools. His lived experience is an antidote to right-wing assaults on public schools, teachers, and government in general.Walz is now a candidate to be vice president of the United States. He has earned this distinction through his decency, intelligence, hard work and perseverance and by taking advantage of an infrastructure of opportunity created by “We the People.”"
