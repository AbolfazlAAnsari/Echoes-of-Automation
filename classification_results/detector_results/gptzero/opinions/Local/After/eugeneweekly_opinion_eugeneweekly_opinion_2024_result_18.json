            "inputText": "We've got issues.\nWard 1 needs a city councilor who will put the community first. Despite Ted Coopman’s short time in Eugene, his outsized influence over the Jefferson Westside Neighborhood (JWN) has allowed us to witness his brand of leadership firsthand. Coopman moved toEugene in 2016 and soonbecame chair of the neighborhood association. Today, as he runs for one of the most powerful positions in local government, it is crucial that voters understand how he has abused his power in that position to promote his personal agenda and self-interests.\nMany will be surprised to learn that,last year, before the Oregon Legislature, Coopman claimed to speak on behalf of theentireJWN to express “enthusiastic support” for constructing the Ems stadium at the Fairgrounds. This washis own personalsupport. However, it was offered in his official capacity as “elected Chair” on official JWN letterhead.\nCoopman’s testimony before the Oregon Legislature was particularly stunning given the Ems stadium has been a significant source of controversy for the neighborhood. Residents have expressed deep concerns, including themore than $100 millionin public subsidies proposed to benefit Elmore Companies, anout-of-state for-profit corporate conglomeratethatowns, among other things,miningandtimbercompanies, and that is free topack up and leaveanytime. Among other concerns are the impacts of traffic, noise/light pollution, and crime on the thousands of surrounding homes (with games, concerts, and other events projected for100+ daysper year); the environmental impacts on wildlife in the Amazon Creek, home togreat blue heron, river otters, beaver and turtles; and the privatization and demolition of community spaces.\nA 2022 survey showed 65 percent of neighbors adjacent to the Fairgroundsopposed the proposal, with only 8 percent in favor. A 2023 survey foundtwo-thirdsof JWN respondents in opposition. Despite thenational attention, no systematic outreach to the neighborhood has occurred. Many neighbors have received little to no information.TheNew York TimesandTheRegister Guardreport that the JWN board — a group of just seven people, including Coopman and hiswife— already voted to support the stadium, but the JWN website assures usotherwise. The webpage states, in boldface, “The JWN Executive Board has not voted to support an Ems sports facility.” Coopman’s March 2024newslettersays that JWN will merely “continue to help facilitate the public process.”\nLocal journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday.\nWhy would Coopman lobby for a project that so many residents oppose without consulting most (if any) residents? And why conceal that support? One clue may be found in Coopman’s financial relationship with Allan Benavides, thegeneral managerof the Emeralds. Notably, Benavides has donated thousands of dollars to support Coopman’s policy agenda. Benavides istiedforlargest donorto Coopman’s City Council race (as of the time of writing). Benavides has also, on behalf of the Ems, donated $1,500in supportof Coopman’s pet project to make the JWN a so-called “historic district” (a desperate effort toprevent the developmentof inclusionary housing, which Coopman’slitigationultimatelyfailedto stop). That donation amounts to more than all the other GoFundMe donors combined. Given Benavides lives in neither JWN nor Ward 1, his generosity may raise a few eyebrows.\nBecause we are not mind readers, we cannot say withabsolutecertainty whether Coopman’s advocacy is motivated by personal enrichment or simple paternalism — a sense that he knows better than his neighbors. In the end, it makes little difference: Coopman has deprived JWN residents of a meaningful voice in one of the most consequential development projects that the neighborhood has seen in decades, and which will have impacts reverberating throughout Ward 1 for decades to come. If elected to City Council, he will exert his will over not only his constituents but the entire city.\nSome may try to reframe this discussion to make it about whether or not you like baseball. But that’s what pitchers call “spin.” Let’s keep our eye on the ball: The real question here is whether Coopman will represent his constituents — not himself, out-of-statemining and logging barons, or the$3.6 billionSan Francisco Giants (Emsaffiliate). This election is fundamentally about whether it will be special interests or the community that has a seat at City Council. A vote against Ted Coopman is a vote for democracy.\nHeather Marek, Anya Dobrowolski  and Christine Beneda are longtime Eugene residents, and have resided in the Jefferson Westside Neighborhood (JWN)  for 14, 10 and 42 years, respectively.\n"
