This decline in ad revenue, a trend for the last decade-plus, has forced many outlets to rely on audience funding, philanthropy, cost-cutting or some combination of the three.In communities with little disposable income to put toward news subscriptions or donations and no local philanthropies, cost-cutting becomes the only option. This creates a self-reinforcing spiral of lower quality and declining readership and, ultimately, closure.In 2023, the country lost more than 130 print newspapers, which continue to be the newsrooms most likely to produce original local content that other outlets circulate.Since 2005, the U.S. has lost almost 2,900 papers.New digital outlets are not being created fast enough to fill that huge void.

Those with an average household income of $54,000 or less are more likely to be news deserts.

This finding aligns withother research, including a previous study I did oflocal news in New Jersey.In addition to household income, population density correlates to the number of outlets serving a local community. In our data, counties with 10 or more outlets are overwhelmingly urban or dense suburbia, while news deserts are usually rural – though news deserts also occur in low-income pockets of metro areas. Densely populated communities tend to include higher-income households and have network effects that come from the ability of businesses to reach a larger number of people in a relatively small footprint.This phenomenon leads to the third factor related to number of outlets in a county: gross domestic product per capita. In any town, city or country, the GDP represents the amount of money netted from sales of services and merchandise, divided by population.

The new Press Forward initiative has begunlocal chapters across the country, with at least one planning to serve rural communities. Organizations like theNational Trust for Local Newshave been buying outlets that would likely otherwise be sold to hedge funds, and turning them into nonprofits that will continue to serve their communities.Public policy should also play a role. At the state level,policiestosupport local newshave seen success in New Jersey, California and elsewhere, andmore billsare working their way through state legislatures.People seem to be realizingthat having quality local news is just as vital as having public education and access to health care. With any luck, every community will have the opportunity to be a journalism “have.”Sarah Stonbely, Director, State of Local News Project,Northwestern UniversityThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.
