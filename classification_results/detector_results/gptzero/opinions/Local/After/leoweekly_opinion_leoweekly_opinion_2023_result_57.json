This, he thought, was a promethean gift, the edge he needed over his rivals, his assurance that 500-page epics with his face on the cover would fill the shelves of commercial bookstores. By the twenty-first day, the old man had forgotten the humiliation of the lily, which was now in full bloom, filling the stale hospital air with a musk that was like a mixture of patchouli oil and microwaved hot dogs; he had devoted his full attention to developing his new talent.

A failed attempt at making the Prime Minister of New Zealand choke on his water during a live press conference, and an equally ineffectual stab at deflating the attending physician’s tires, led him to deduce that he could only control objects in his immediate vicinity. “No matter,” he thought. “I’ll be released soon, and the world will see.”But he was not released soon, and the world never saw. The lily, now perplexingly enormous, made it impossible to return the old man to an upright position, as it had split his skull even wider. No doctor could tell him for certain whether there was some link between brain flowers and telekinesis, and so he refused to be stitched up. He hung there for an agonizingly long period while medical specialists pondered the safest way to get him upright again.During that time, the old man improved his fine motor skills by assembling elaborate dioramas from uneaten food and other objects in his hospital room: Cheerios and pineapple became playgrounds for his great-grandchildren; Jell-O became vast, sprawling cities of orange marble; edible arrangements sent by congressional staffers were painstakingly picked apart and made into portraits of people who had not yet been born; a thousand grains of rice and loose change were rearranged to make genderless people sunbathing in public parks. After countless hours of practice, he found that he could strip the ink out of newspapers and magazines, allowing him an ashy substance to smear on mirrors or suspend in patterns in the air. One late night, he recreated from newsprint Albert Robida’s “Paris la Nuit,” a futuristic illustration that he had memorized in exacting detail as a boy, on the south wall of his room. The cleaning staff wiped it away while he slept.After nearly six months of makeshift art that grew progressively more detailed with every project, the old man realized he had not placed himself in any of his creations. A week of frustrated experimentation revealed that he could not do so even if he tried. Any attempt to reconstruct a scene from the past, or to invent a future that included his own image, fell apart; sticks and coins would not stay connected, processed foods melted into unrecognizable shapes, inky black dust became a faceless phantom before being scattered by an inexplicable gust of wind.The old man demanded the lily be cut out of his head. The doctors disconnected him from his straps and his tubes, stapled him together, and sent him home. The lily withered and turned brown, as all cut flowers do; a janitor threw it in the trash. No one mentioned the old man’s fall or his hospital stay ever again, not even to ask him how he felt. In a few days, the old man himself had forgotten all about it.•*** ."
