Johnson regarding the Oregon city’s ordinance allowing police to fine or jail homeless people for sleeping outside. A federal district court ruled that the law violated the 8th Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment and blocked it from being enforced. The 9th Circuit upheld the ruling. The city petitioned the Supreme Court to weigh in and it agreed.Most of the justices seemed troubled by the idea of fining and jailing homeless people as a way to deal with homelessness.
