The good news is that there is a solution. The bad news is that employers aren’t using it.I am a job-seeker who is neurodivergent — meaning my brain doesn’t work in a typical way and processes information differently than most people. Some studies estimate that 15-20% of the population is the same way. Despite this, employers aren’t seeking us out.In my experience, job listings don’t commonly use the word ‘neurodiverse’ or ‘neurodivergent.’ Neurodiverse and neurodivergent seem to only appear in listings for professionals who would work with people who are neurodivergent. An example is a special education teacher.A United Kingdom study found that 40% of self-made millionaires are dyslexic. The founder of Kinkos, the founder of IKEA, various members of Shark Tank and Olympic champion swimmer Michael Phelps are all neurodiverse. People who are neurodiverse also make good employees.My fellow neurodiverse job candidates and I have had to do things differently throughout our lives. Some people solve problems by saying there has to be a better way. We have never had a choice. It’s who we are as human beings. This skill set is applicable in a workplace environment.Another benefit of being neurodiverse is the ability to leverage autonomy. In my experience, leadership benefits from employees who need less help. Traditional explanations and instructions haven’t always made sense to me. However, being allowed to adapt has been beneficial. Time to adapt equals autonomy. Autonomy equates to a better managerial experience. It’s a win for everyone.With that said, autonomy requires patience. It may take someone who is neurodiverse longer to complete tasks. They may complete them in a non-typical way. While beneficial, it can come across as rebellious. Being patient with this alternative approach can be understandably difficult. Humans don’t always respond calmly when outside their comfort zone. This is especially true when they are already dealing with the stress of managing employees.Employees who aren’t neurotypical can confuse others. My understanding is that being neurotypical means that your brain works in a more typical manner. People who are neurodivergent may speak or behave differently. Understanding how to interact with them can be confusing. For example, I have read that job interviews can be difficult for people who are uncomfortable making eye contact. Job training is another possible obstacle. The ultimate obstacle is finding something you can apply for.Looking for work isn’t normally fun or easy. People from all walks of life have trouble. Entry-level jobs aren’t what they used to be. For better or worse, things have shifted. The upside is that the economy has shifted from knowledge-based to skills-based. This can benefit some people who are neurodivergent. The downside for everyone who is neurodiverse is that getting your foot in the door is half the battle.Based on the job listings I have seen, many entry-level employers seem focused on filtering employees through training programs. The ones that don’t still seem focused on grouping employees under labels, such as a team member. I agree with the latter approach. The problem is that if you are neurodivergent, you likely have two options: apply with the hope that your managers understand your neurodiversity, or keep looking. Another option could be to do everything in your power to hide your neurodiversity.I physically look “normal” and when I talk, my voice sounds “normal.” However, there are things that I struggle with because of my neurodiversity. The upside for people who can hide their challenges is that they get to blend in. The downside is that when they struggle, it can confuse leadership.Not being able to be yourself is also another possible issue. The curse of being neurodivergent is that you struggle a lot with stuff. The gift is that there are things you are gifted at.In high school, I never got past middle school-level math and science. However, at the same time, I was able to take college-level English. If you are an employer seeking employees, you should list the words neurodivergent and/or neurodiverse in your listing. Being an inclusive workplace is part of it. The other part is that it could lead to you hiring someone with a unique perspective who is possibly gifted at something.Samuel Goldman lives in rural Minnesota. Like many people who are neurodiverse, he is searching for his next opportunity."
