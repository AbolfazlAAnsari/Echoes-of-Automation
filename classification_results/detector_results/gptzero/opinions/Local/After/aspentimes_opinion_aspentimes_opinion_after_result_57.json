Their vision and a positive nod from council initiated an educational outreach effort, named “Citizens for Aspen’s Community Center.”\nCouncil decided to put the building usage question to a public vote in November 2015 due to controversy over a new city hall adjacent to Rio Grande Park, which has now been completed. Some people wanted the city to keep some of its offices in City Hall so it could build a smaller new building. In the end, citizens selected “Community Use” over “City Offices” by 86 votes.\nThe Armory building vote came on the heels of an intensive, six-month campaign by the citizen’s group, whose vision statement was at the core of the messaging. It read:\n“A group of long-time residents envision returning historic Armory Hall to its former glory as a multi-use community center and meeting space for the benefit of the public. We believe in celebrating our rich community spirit through the possibilities inherent in such a restoration.\n“Our concept is for a diversity of public uses such as community dances, music and dance performances, athletic activities, arts and science lectures, political gatherings, an indoor winter farmer’s market, a roller skating rink, community meetings and much more.”\nThe campaign reached 14 nonprofit/group meetings and 59 one-on-one meetings, totaling 134 individuals plus another 2,000 through mailings and 300 people through an election forum. The group met with 12 newspaper editors, columnists and radio/TV stations plus an editorial board. They produced fact sheets, a direct mail card, social media posts, presentations and a letter-to-the-editor plan. They heard clearly that people wanted a community gathering place downtown.\nFast forward almost a decade. The city is ready to hone in on what “community use” means currently and determine how to renovate the vacated City Hall, so a brief walk down history lane may serve useful.\nBuilt in 1892, the Armory is believed to be the oldest of the 19 armories built in Colorado and of 12 still standing in Colorado. They were built between the 1890s and 1920s to house militia protecting the territories and later miners and ranchers. The militia eventually became the Colorado National Guard. The armories morphed to primarily community use by the 1940s and became most cities’ social hubs.\nThere’s long been support for use of the Aspen Armory as a community center, with dozens of articles written about the effort over the past 100 years. Hosts of old timers tell stories of great times there, remembering school dances, social balls, roller skating, flower shows and hosting the 1950 FIS racers and the Silver Queen. The Armory was truly the community’s gathering place.\nBut, as with many causes in Aspen, the process was fr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging Director White Elephant Aspen White Elephant Resorts is now accepting applications for the position of Managing Director of White…\nSeeking FT Operations Manager for high end homecare division of Hansen Construction.
