The Clean Energy Resource Teams (CERTS) reports that one solar air heater directly reduces a household’s fossil fuel use and can save a family up to 30% of their monthly heating cost for 20 years. A single panel alone can reduce a modest home’s fossil fuel use and carbon emissions by 20%-40%, depending on the building.The benefits of solar thermal heat extend way beyond the reservation into non-Native communities and businesses. The world is finally awakening to the benefits of solar heating in a variety of settings, however slowly; Climate News reports that the U.S. had 373,055 solar thermal systems in operation at the end of 2021,according to the International Energy Agency(IEA) —  not a lot given that it’s less than one-tenth the number of solar photovoltaic systems in the country.As of the end of 2023, the total operational solar thermal capacity reached 560 GWth (giga-watts thermal), equivalent to 800 million square meters of collector area, according to IEA-SHC (the Solar Heating and Cooling Programme). The annual solar thermal energy yield of this installed capacity amounted to 456 TWh (terawatt hour), which correlates to savings of 49.1 million tons of oil and 158.4 million tons of CO2.Even as fossil fuels still dominate heating energy, incremental change matters. So would offering the high 30% rebate for solar thermal systems that the more popular and visible photovoltaic systems receive today.Retired sales professional Jeff Edington is a firm believer in the future of solar thermal after he bought an old uninsulated concrete airplane hangar near the Twin Cities and added solar thermal heating panels to the hangar’s exterior south walls. After completing the installation and using the system early in the 2023 heating season, Jeff then became something of an advocate for both the product and the company. In full disclosure, he purchased the panels from the non-profit company I work for,Eighth Fire Solar– made in Native America!A small repair shop in South Dakota, a residence high in the Colorado Rockies, a machine shop in Great Falls, Montana, and others are likewise happy users of solar thermal panels manufactured on the White Earth Nation in Pine Point, Minnesota. This micro manufacturing business provides much needed jobs and training to Native folks in an area where work is often scarce.Should we be hopeful about growing solar thermal heating? A 2023 IEA thinks so. But the planet continues to overheat at alarming rates, and the impacts are increasingly widespread: The IEA Renewables Report 2023 assumes that the share of heat from renewable energy will increase by more than 40% worldwide in 2023-28. However, this growth corresponds to only 70% of the projected global increase in total heat demand, leading to a rise in fossil fuel consumption for heat and the associated CO2 emissions.Photovoltaics systems have already transformed the quality of life in many parts of the world. But harnessing the sun’s energy through solar thermal panels to also heat homes and businesses is an idea whose time has come. It’s a natural solution that combines traditional Indigenous views of land stewardship and environmental empathy with modern, renewable technology. It’s ready to take center stage — if given the chance.Gwe Gasco is the Program Coordinator for 8thFire Solar in Pine Point, Minnesota, where a small Native workforce manufactures, markets and installs thermal solar panels."
