St. Teresa of Calcutta, Pope St. John Paul II, and others.Know what, folks, I keep a small collection of prayers that, through the years, have been a big inspiration and help in my life, while I struggle each day living in/with (chronic lower back) pain. I psyche myself saying, Jesus, this pain is nothing compared to what you’ve suffered.It’s my faith that keeps me going on in life every day. I thank God for what I have and don’t have. I pray, “Jesus, I trust in You. Jesus, I believe and trust. in You (three times).Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, God.”At times, when I pray, I ask for the intercession of saints or blesseds to intercede on our behalf. Praying to God through the saints or blesseds, or anyone in heaven on our behalf, connects us to a core belief of our Catholic faith: our communion with the living and the dead.-Chris A.
