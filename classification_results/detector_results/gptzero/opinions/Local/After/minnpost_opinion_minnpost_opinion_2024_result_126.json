Something purposeful solving a key higher education problem. Something of value, a truly good idea that can engage important elements of your campus.”The need for a uniting, positive force was the lesson the 20 institutions then developing three-year degrees talked about almost endlessly. They now knew what worked, what didn’t and how their effort had come to matter.It was the lessonChristopher Hopey, president of Merrimack College, learned when he challenged a small group of his faculty to design three-year baccalaureate curricula.Two months in he told me that his faculty were finding theCollege-in-3work liberating, that it had given them a burst of energy and optimism.Other schools had similar experiences; once they got going, success built on itself. What looked at first to be impossible had proven to be doable. There had been encouragement from their accreditors and a willingness on the part of their institutional friends to help.What makes these results possible is now pretty well understood by the members of College-in-3.First, nearly every participating institution thought small, offering just a couple of three-year options, not the entire undergraduate curriculum. And while the prospect of an undergraduate degree that costs students one-quarter less was an administrative talking point, the real excitement was generated by the opportunity to design something really new, beginning with what students did their first year.Old taboos were discarded. New ideas were readily tried and discarded if they didn’t work. The new watchword for effective design became, “Is it truly student centered?”It became easier to integrate traditional learning outcomes with vocational interests; there was a new willingness to make internships, summer work and learning experiences elements of the new curriculum. That made it easier to consider this question: “What do we expect our students to know and be able to do when they leave us?”Perhaps the most unexpected development was the feistiness of institutions that faced regulatory roadblocks. TheNew England Commission of Higher Education,for example, told the first of our institutions to submit proposals for a three-year degree to wait for a while.Not deterred, the institutions mounted a successful campaign that convinced the commission to issue guidelines for approving three-year options.In a different region, a public institution sought approval for a three-year degree, and seemingly did everything right, including securing the endorsement of its accreditor. But it ran into a political buzz saw when it sought the required approval of its state legislature: The faculty union declared the idea of a three-year baccalaureate degree dead on arrival. A 25% reduction in time to degree would mean fewer faculty jobs in general and fewer jobs in the liberal arts in particular.The faculty union won. Yet, the institution, refusing to give up, has remained active in College-in-3.Our push for a three-year alternative is not the only way to do something that matters, to create a uniting force. Still, it neatly illustrates the advantages of what I have in mind, involving both what and how students learn.College-in-3 does not call for protests or other means of acting out, but it can promise success for all students deemed worthy of admission, regardless of their backgrounds.Not lamentations on a theme. Not the righteous anger of those alienated by a world turned topsy-turvy. Instead, purposeful change designed from the bottom up. That’s the antidote higher education needs.Robert Zemsky was the founding director of theInstitute for Research on Higher Educationat the University of Pennsylvania.This commentary originally appeared in The Hechinger Report."
