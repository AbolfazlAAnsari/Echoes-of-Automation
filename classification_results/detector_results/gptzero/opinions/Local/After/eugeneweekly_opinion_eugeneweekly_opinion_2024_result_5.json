We’ve come a long way, I’d say, from substantial social connectedness.\nBut let’s take a more contemporary look, starting, say, with Robert Putnam’s 2000 book,Bowling Alone: Collapse and Revival of American Community.He said we used to bowl in leagues, now we do it alone. The larger part, of course, is the great decline in all kinds of social groups: fraternal orders, clubs, associations, etc.\nThe biggest factor driving this social dis-integration is the rise of online “life.” Namely, the enormous arrival of e-consumption, including the smartphone as of 1994 and the explosion of “social” media around 2000.\nThe most prominent and disturbing result of the high-tech onslaught has been the public health crisis of the young: anxiety, loneliness, depression, rising suicide rates.\nLocal journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday.\nJust lately, further news of social withdrawal: fewer go out to movies or clubs, according to economic data. There’s a general move away from human contact, including the high number of youth who don’t answer their phones, preferring texts to the sound of a human voice. Instead of human contact, we are moving to “telehealth” or even, in Texas, to “treating” patients via holograms (New York Times, July 8).\nThere are some small signs of resistance to the juggernaut, such as reversion to vinyl records, “dumbphones” and film cameras. But sadly enough, historian David Andress was right in 2023: “We thought the internet could change society. Instead, it became society.”\nBiz BeatApril 27, 2017In \"Biz Beat\"\nLocal and VocalJuly 18, 2024In \"Viewpoint\"\nA New Paper in TownMarch 29, 2018In \"Culture\"\nBy Joe Berney You may have heard about the recent controversy surrounding a facility that will recycle over 80,000 tons of materials annually, convert methane …Continue reading→\nDan Bryant at First Christian ChurchPhoto by Trask Bedortha Frederick Fisher is a name many won’t recognize, but the incident he sparked in 1954 is …Continue reading→\nZach Klonoski and his son, Quentin, age 5.
