What a coincidence that Feb. 14, Valentine’s Day, is also Ash Wednesday, which ushers in the season of Lent for Catholics and other Christian denominations worldwide.It’s interesting to note and know that there are two purported Valentines on the list of Roman Martyrology for February 14. They both became saints for being martyred because of their faith and healing miracles. One is St. Valentine, a Roman priest and martyr, around AD 270, during emperor Claudius Gothicus Caesar’s rule. He died by decapitation at Via Flaminia in Rome for refusing to follow the emperor’s wishes for conversion to worshipping other gods. Seventy years later, another Valentine, a bishop of Terni (a city of Umbria in Italy, outside of Rome), was imprisoned and martyred (dragged and beheaded) and later on became a saint for his strong faith in God.(During the Middle Ages, the Benedictine Order maintained the church of St. Valentine in Terni.
