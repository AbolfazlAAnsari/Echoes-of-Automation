Josh Shapirosigned an executive orderdirecting up to $400 million in federal dollars over five years to reimburse organizations that train new infrastructure workers on the job. The money is coming from $19 billion in federal funds from two federal programs for infrastructure projects.According to reports, “organizations doing infrastructure work — such as repairing roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes and expanding high-speed internet — could receive up to $40,000 for each new worker they train. A maximum of $400,000 could be reimbursed through the program, which will be managed by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry.” (Those of us who know our history may be struck by the number 40 in that figure — reminiscent of the “40 acres and a mule” emancipated African Americans were supposed to have been given by the federal government, but never received.)I say let’s focus those training efforts on Black citizens returning from incarceration and others who may have committed low-level offenses in the criminal justice system. Let’s help this cohort — who aredisproportionately represented in the systemand often denied the opportunity to gain meaningful work — a chance to learn how to do these infrastructure jobs. These are the kinds of jobs that sustain families and put things like buying a home within reach. This approach, and other initiatives like it, would have a bigger and more lasting impact on Black Philadelphians than direct reparations payments.As African Americans, we can’t disregard the power of our votes, and that means demanding the Democratic Party live up to its commitments to our community.
