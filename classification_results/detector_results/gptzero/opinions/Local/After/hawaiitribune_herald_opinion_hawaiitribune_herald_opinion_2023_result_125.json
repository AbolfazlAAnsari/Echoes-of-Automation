That should not be a problem with Hawaiian, as I find more and more words finding their way into my everyday speech.Languages reflect people’s experiences.

Twenty percent of the Spanish language has its roots in Arabic because of the Moorish occupation of the Iberian peninsula in the Middle Ages.

As a Hawaiian-serving institution, the Hawaiian language permeates our ceremony: a part of my remarks is in Hawaiian, our school chant is the “Ua Ao Hawai‘i” and after we sing the “Star Spangled Banner,” we sing “Hawai‘i Pono‘i.” I always enjoy hearing so many of our students, faculty, staff, and families chiming in on the Hawaiian songs as well as the English ones.
