            "inputText": "Santos' fibs about his religious background aren't nearly as serious as his other lies. As a Jew, I think they're more like a joke.\rGeorge Santos, who will take the congressional oath of office after the U.S. House of Representatives elects a speaker, appears to be a serial liar. The newly elected GOP representative from Queens and Long Island lied about hiseducation, his job history, andeven his charity activity. He’s nowunder local and federal investigation.\rOf course, Santos should face the full force of the law for any crimes he committed. And he should also apologize for falsely claiming to have attended Baruch College and New York University, which insults people who actually put in the effort to obtain degrees there.\rBut lying about his alleged Jewish ancestry? Meh.\rYes, Santos falsely asserted that hismaternal grandparents were Jews who fled Europeduring World War II. But Santos’ fibs about his religious background aren’t nearly as serious as his other lies. As a Jew, I think they’re more like a joke.\rAnd the joke comes to us courtesy of comedian Lenny Bruce, who famously quipped that “if you live in New York, you’re Jewish.” Not literally, of course, but culturally. To Bruce, “Jewish” referred to a state of mind and a set of habits — not to a lineage or ancestry. Anyone could claim it.\rBut, no surprise, people don’t flood to make false claims about Jewish heritage. For most of history, any association with Judaism was more likely to hold you back than to push you forward. Many Jewschanged their nameswhen they came to the United States, to avoid the sting of discrimination. Other Americans were falsely charged with having Jewish ancestry, which was an effective way to malign them.\r“For most of history, any association with Judaism was more likely to hold you back than to push you forward.”\rDid you know that Franklin D. Roosevelt was Jewish? Of course, he wasn’t. But that’s what his antisemitic enemies said in the 1930s. Roosevelt’s real name, they said, was Rosenfeld. (For good measure, they also called FDR’sNew Deal the “Jew Deal.”)\rAbraham Lincoln? Jewish. Harry Truman? Also Jewish. Ditto Bill Clinton. All lies, of course, but you can find them on any number of antisemitic websites today. You’ll also discover that Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci, and their efforts to promote COVID-19 vaccines, are part of a Jewish plot to spread disease and control the globe.\rIn Russia, meanwhile, state propagandists have charged that Ukraine is under the control of Nazis, who are secret Jews. Never mind that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is openly Jewish. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters last May that Adolf Hitler “had Jewish blood, too,” and that “the most ardent antisemites are usually Jews.”\rAgainst this background, Santos’ lies about his Jewish ancestry seem relatively innocuous. He didn’t slur anyone for being Jewish; to the contrary, he eagerly claimed the identity for himself. “I’m supposed to care, if in an age of rabid antisemitism, a politician wants to join my tribe?” aboard member of the Republican Jewish Coalitionaskedthe New York Times last month. “Not at the forefront of my concerns.”\rIt’s not at the forefront of mine, either. And I also wonder why most Jews who are blasting Santos didn’t make as big a deal when questions arose over progressive New York State Sen. Julia Salazar’sclaims that her father was Jewish. Part of the reason is that Santos is in the U.S. Congress, which is a much higher-profile position. But another reason is good old-fashioned politics:Most Jews are Democrats, so we’re more likely to indict a conservative fibber than a liberal one.\r» READ MORE:Will George Santos or reality win in 2023? | Will Bunch Newsletter\rLet’s also remember that Santos and Salazar aren’t the only politicians to misrepresent their ethnic or racial heritage. During her career as a law professor, which includedeight years at Penn, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) claimed — with little evidence — that she was Native American. She later took aDNA test to “prove” the same— although the results, which showed her Native American ancestry may come from 10 generations in the past, led tobacklash from the right and left.\rNone of that made it OK for Donald Trump to give her the racist nickname “Pocahontas,” of course. And to her credit, Warren apologized for the DNA test.\rBut why does it matter who we “really” are? Isn’t it more important what we do? I’m much more interested in finding out how Santos was able tolend his own campaign $700,000— after reporting no assets and a $55,000 salary in 2020 — than I am in figuring out if he’s Jewish.\rThe whole line of inquiry reminds me of another classic Jewish joke, about the Jew who is shipwrecked on a desert island and builds two synagogues: the one he attends, andthe one he would never step foot in.\rJews don’t agree about anything, including what makes us Jewish in the first place. So let’s stop worrying about whether George Santos is.\rJonathan Zimmerman teaches education and history at the University of Pennsylvania.
