One undercover investigator described Holden Farms as a “house of horrors.” (Editor’s note: Holden Farms, inresponding toallegations in a federal complaint, said it adheres to “high-quality animal care standards”).According to polling data, most pork consumers in the U.S. believe that the use of gestation crates is objectionable.
