Gretchen Whitmer made this remark. It’s an insightful observation that reflects a major characteristic of Trump and how he will govern should he be elected.It is not precisely true that Trump doesn’t laugh. He does smirk and sneer. His amusement seems to take the form of self-congratulation when he denigrates others or when others do the same.Laughter and joy are not measures to be dismissed. They reveal much about an individual’s mindset and mental health.Ronald Reagan knew how to laugh. He and House Speaker Tip O’Neill could laugh at and with each other. Lyndon Johnson was personally known for his sense of humor. A great storyteller, he navigated many an impasse with laughter.Laughter brings people together, signals acceptance, and fosters connection regardless of differences of opinion.Laughter at the expense of others divides. Trump’s smirk is unhealthy. It shows an inability to relate to others’ feelings or to be self-effacing. It compromises his ability to work with others.Trump has called Vice President Kamala Harris’ laugh weird, like a behavior he doesn’t understand. From a psychological perspective, Harris’ laugh is healthy. It reflects confidence and acceptance of herself and others.Trump uses laughter effectively to influence his supporters. His smirk bonds his followers through slurs, insults and prejudice.The power of laughter is evident in Trump’s support. His rallies are filled with laughter — unhealthy laughter. Trump’s one-liners, disparaging his opponents, are the highlight of his events. His grins when the audience responds is about as close to laughter as he can get.Between his exaggerations of greatness and grandiose predictions, his followers are treated to pleasure at the expense of others. Spontaneous laughter is absent, but degrading laughter is abundant.Liberals often fail to realize laughter’s role in elevating Trump to his popularity. Supporters see friendliness, good cheer and camaraderie at his rallies and a bond with neighbors. Laughing together is powerful.Laughter is a behavior and an emotion. Emotions play an enormous role in how voters vote. Republicans took great offense at Hillary Clinton’s words “basket of deplorables” — a comment she believes was distorted. She claimed she was only referring to “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic and Islamophobic,” but it didn’t matter. Accurate or not, the emotions evoked by her words strengthened middle-class division against her and may have cost her the election.In a recent rally in Atlanta, Trump confessed that “I only like people that like me,” a rare expression of his internal feelings.
