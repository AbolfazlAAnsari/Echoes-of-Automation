(Joe Raedle/Getty Images/TNS)Given Donald Trump’s stubborn standing atop polls of Republican voters, there may be no more meaningless exercise in futility right now than even talking about the rest of the GOP presidential field, let alone tentatively backing one candidate in that field.Still, a lot could happen between now and the bulk of the primaries this spring: Trump could be criminally convicted, or his age and health could become an issue, or (perhaps least likely) his supporters could come to their senses.
