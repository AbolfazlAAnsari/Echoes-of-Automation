These incidents are known as eloping. Children may elope because of executive functioning differences that cause a lack of impulse control, a difference in social skills that makes them not understand “stranger danger,” or because they become overwhelmed by sensory input, creating a fight or flight reaction. If a child is non-speaking, they may have a hard time communicating that they need help when they elope. All of these issues make elopement particularly dangerous for children with autism and disabilities. Here are eight strategies to help keep your child safe.1.Take note of elopement triggersMany children with autism have sensory processing differences, which can make sensory input from loud noises, bright lights and crowds overwhelming. A child who is overwhelmed may shut down as a result of too much stimuli; others may run to calm down. Children who find running calming are going to be an elopement risk.If your child tends to elope, notice what is happening in their environment prior to those episodes. Ask your child if there is something they find particularly overwhelming in your home. Then, work with your child to modify that environment, or offer sensory regulation tools that work for them. If your child just loves to run, plan regular outings to the gym, visit a nearby school’s track or create an obstacle course in your backyard.2.Teach your child their contact informationTeach your child their address, your phone number and how to dial 9-1-1. Give children who are non-speaking an identification bracelet with their name and your contact information. Look foridentification bracelets designed for young children, which are hard to remove, made of fabric and can alert people about autism or other medical information. Children with autism may not like the feel of traditional ID bracelets and may try to remove them.3.Install alarms on your doors and windowsConsider installingdoor or window alarmsthat signal when a door or window is opened. This might stop your child, or at least alert you that your child is trying to leave the house. Another idea is to put an image of a stop sign by windows and doors as a visual reminder to your child that they shouldn’t elope. Sometimes, causing them to slow down and think about what they’re doing can make a big difference. While window locks or keypad locks might seem like a good idea, before installing, reach out to your local fire department to ensure these are safe in the event of an emergency.4.Consider getting your child a smartwatchIf your child is prone to elopement, having a smartwatch with GPS capability can help you find them if they wander off. You can also text or call with many smartwatches, which can help you quickly contact your child if you get separated. If your child is reading but nonspeaking, texting provides a quick means of communication. You could also attach an AirTag to your child’s keys or place an AirTag bracelet on a regular watch band.5.Befriend your neighborsIf your child often tries to elope, get to know your neighbors. Introduce yourself and explain that your child has autism or a disability and is prone to eloping. Introduce your child to neighbors so they know what your child looks like, and your child understands that your neighbors are safe people.6.Get your child swimming lessonsChildren with autism are often drawn to water, which is dangerous without supervision. Teaching your child how to swim is another safety precaution. Kids with autism and disabilities may need swimming lessons adapted specifically to their unique needs. Local companies, like Swim Possible, “provide safe, calming, and fun lessons that are customized for students who need a personalized approach — adapted to their needs for learning how to swim.” Here are a few other organizations which offer swimming lessons to people with autism and disabilities:​Clownfish Swim ClubMr. Blake’s Swim AcademySwim 4 Life Swimming Schools7.Teach your child what to do instead of elopingInstead of focusing on what not to do — don’t run away — make sure your child has positive options for dealing with sensory issues. Teach them to use their preferred communication system — words, pictures or a speech-generating device — to ask someone to stop. Or teach them to say, “I don’t like that” if something is distressing to them. Identify a predetermined safe space so your child can take a break from stimulation that’s feeling overwhelming. You can also give your child a coping tool like noise-reducing headphones or a strategy like deep breathing to help them self-regulate. Role-playing these options when your child is calm will help them know what to do when they encounter something upsetting.8.Plan strategies for community activitiesAttending community events can be particularly challenging for children with autism and disabilities, particularly if your child often elopes. Before you attend, read as much information about the event as possible and plan how long you’ll stay. Some venues and events have “Know Before You Go” information, letting you know what to expect and where to find accessibility accommodations. You can also work with your clinical team — which may include an occupational therapist, speech therapist or family therapist — to create an individualized plan that helps your child navigate community activities and events safely. Your plan might include bringing helpful sensory tools like noise-canceling headphones, fidgets and weighted items. You could also create a rotating schedule with your partner, children and other family members to ensure your child always has a buddy.“Promoting safety awareness in children with autism and disabilities is essential,” says Gina Brady, Fraser Sensory Supports and Training Manager. “It empowers them to navigate their environment confidently while minimizing risks, thereby enhancing overall quality of life for the whole family.”Gina Brady is the sensory supports and training program manager atFraser, a Minneapolis organization that provides healthcare and inclusion services for people with autism, mental health issues and disabilities."
