And this Pride Month, I will celebrate their courageous self-discovery and our humbling, sacred journey toward affirming parenthood.Like many parents of LGBTQIA children, my wife, Sondra, and I knew. In the back of our minds, we knew our child did not fit the expectations for a girl. Boys’ and men’s jackets were a much better fit and they wouldn’t be caught dead in a skirt. Strangers often thought they were a boy, and they were not offended. They liked trains and car toys and were disinterested in Barbie dolls. They always debated the unfairness of what boys were allowed. They also wanted no pictures of themself hung, shared, or displayed. And they were quite ambivalent about relationships.Away at college, they called to say, after giving heterosexuality an uncomfortable turn, they embraced a lesbian identity. Unbeknownst to us, the identity quandary was far from over. It was not until a year later, when Sondra casually mentioned a friend’s non-binary status, that they finally were able to share a secret they had been hiding for a year. They were, in fact, non-binary and would now embrace the pronouns they/them.On the one hand, it made perfect sense and was a confirmation of history. On the other hand, we dreaded the misunderstanding, judgment, and even animosity they might experience in the great, wide, binary, often-mean world. And we also grieved the loss of “normalcy” that made life so simple and predictable for us. Change is hard. We used to be the confident parents of a strange girl. Now, we were the insecure parents of a non-binary person. From now on, there would be endless adjustments for us and all their existing relationships. We still make many mistakes.Fortunately, they have three incredibly supportive siblings, who have been confidantes along the process with them. They have run interference, corrected our mislabeling and misinterpretations, and nurtured our understanding. It is hard to embrace the fact that one’s child has been alone in very difficult work for years, all while being in your care.We were certainly not alone in our journey. It turns out, several friends were going through the same process with their own dear children. I formed a strong bond with another dad, whose child had also moved from self-doubt to great confidence and social ease. These friends were all great sources of wisdom, insights, and assurance that our child could also find community and understanding.And so, we moved into the new reality with great commitment to dispense with our insecurities, embrace the journey and put our egos and expectations aside. We have become grateful for the courage and stamina of our child, who faces misunderstanding, scary news stories and the uncertain reactions of uninitiated family and friends every day. Our child is a champion.The most serendipitous outcome has been the absolute turnaround in mental health, well-being, identity confidence, and purpose. In fact, clarity of mind has led to clarity of purpose and the freedom to focus on their growing successes. Our conversations are now full of admiration and gratitude, flowing fulsomely both ways. It has become a family journey, with our child leading us to embrace a more complex understanding of human sexuality, close-up and intimate.I grieve for the many generations of young people who did not enjoy society’s scientific and cultural evolution in understanding human sexuality and gender identities. We are grateful for all the parents before us, especially the ones who led the love-filled revolution for the acceptance of gay marriage. And we gladly join them in this work to set our children free.This Pride Month, I send this message to my non-binary child: We are deeply grateful for who you are. You have expanded our world and made us better parents and people. We will always protect you, within the sphere of our influence, from all hostility. We will defend your right to be who you are and to be that well. But most importantly, we will protect you with our unconditional and enduring love. We now understand that by allowing you to be yourself fully, we are becoming more wholesome ourselves. Your father is proud of you and honored to be your student.Don Samuels is a candidate for Congress in Minnesota’s 5th District and the former CEO of MicroGrants.
