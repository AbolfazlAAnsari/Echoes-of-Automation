In 2000, the average American wrote roughly 60 checks cleared by the Fed each year, compared with about nine today.Until 20 years ago, all checks had to be physically returned to the person writing the check after they were processed so that the writer could make sure the amount they wrote the check for matched what was deducted from their account. Years ago, I paid all my bills by check, and each month, my bank would send a fat envelope — which I never opened — containing my canceled checks.To physically return all the checks, the government maintained a special fleet of planes that each night flew canceledchecks around the country. Then in2004, a new law allowed banks to send customers picturesof their checks, which eliminated the need to fly them.While the Fed may be processing 80% fewer checks than it was in the early 2000s, its data shows the average person is still writing at least nine checks a year. So who is writing all those checks? The answer includes many people who deny ever writing checks.Let me explain. Many people now use their bank’sonline bill payment service. While many of these payments are done electronically,payments to smaller businesses and individuals are doneby the bank writing a check on your behalf.Plus, there are still people who write outchecks to landlords, contractors, charities and government agencies. Manypeople still give checksat weddings, births and other special occasions. Last, manybusinesses still write checks to other businesseswhen paying their bills.Given that checks are still being used — albeit less often than before — why are businesses like Target, Whole Foods and Aldi refusing them? I think an important part of the story is thatcheck fraud is becoming rampantin the U.S.The U.S. Treasury has a dedicated department that fights monetary crimes, called theFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCen for short. FinCen gets “Suspicious Activity Reports” from banks about activities from money laundering to loan fraud. FinCen reports that the number of check fraud caseshas exploded since 2020, nearly doubling from 2021 to 2022.One of thebiggest places where this fraud occurs are checks writtenat the cash register. As the Atlanta Fed points out, “Anyone with graphics software and a high-quality printer can readily turn out counterfeit checks.”Merchants are hit with a double whammy when check fraud occurs. First, they lose the merchandise, which cannot be sold to a legitimate customer. Then, unlike shoplifting, the store is faced with more financial pain because most banks chargeboth the merchantand thecheck writerwhen a counterfeit check is presented. Both sides are charged because the Federal Reservecharges high fees for returninguncollectable checks.Target’s most recentannual report mentioneda problem with theft, saying, “We continue to experience higher inventory shrink, as a percentage of sales, relative to historical levels.” Translated into plain language, this means people are stealing more from Target than they have in the past.The increase in check fraud means Target’s recent announcement will likely be repeated soon by other chains. I expect in the futureonly stores like Costco, which photograph every member and has every customer’s address on file, will allow checks.Since retailers often raise prices when check fraud happens to cover the losses, curbing check fraud lowers prices and is in the interest of every honest consumer.And for those stores worried about increasing check,debitandcredit card fraud, there is a simple answer: Encourage your customers to use cash. Paper money is safe and secure, and once handed over, any retailer knows the transaction is paid. Going old-school withpaper moneyhas real benefits.Jay L.
