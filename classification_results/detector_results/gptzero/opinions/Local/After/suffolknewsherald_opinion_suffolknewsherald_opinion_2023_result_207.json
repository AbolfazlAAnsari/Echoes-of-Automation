Hopefully, you’ll be transformed to a new you, filled with hope, peace, love and charity.With belief and trust in the divine mercy, Jesus, our Lord and Savior-God, you’ll be at peace with yourself and others, and fearless to face life’s insurmountable challenges, changes and crises.“Thank you, Lord, for today and tomorrow. I am grateful and so blessed to be alive. Help me to do your will, to observe the Ten Commandments. Strengthen my faith in You always. Jesus, I believe and trust in You. This I ask, through the intercession of all the good angels and saints, with Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever. Amen.”Mama Mary or Mother Mary, mother of God, Jesus Christ, is our spiritual mother and patroness of the Americas and the universal church.We pray: “Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus! Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us, sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.”St. Joseph, head of the holy family, Jesus’s foster father, our spiritual father and patron saint of the universal church, is one quiet saint who, we fathers especially, can inspire us to be good and responsible fathers.To help protect our children and our families, our church and our world, let’s pray to St. Joseph, the terror of demons: “Saint Joseph, Terror of Demons, cast your solemn gaze upon the devil and all his minions, and protect us with your mighty staff. You fled through the night to avoid the devil’s wicked designs; now with the power of God, smite the demons as they flee from you! Grant special protection, we pray for children, fathers, families, and the dying. By God’s grace, no demon dares approach while you are near, so we beg of you, always be near us! Amen.”As a peace-loving child of God, I love praying the Peace Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi: “Lord, make me an instrument of Your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is sadness, joy. O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen.”St. Therese (the Little Flower) of Lisieux, the Carmelite nun and doctor of the church, said, “For me, prayer is an aspiration of the heart; it is a simple glance directed to heaven; it is a cry of gratitude and love in the midst of trial as well as joy; finally, it is something great, supernatural, which expands my soul and unites me to Jesus.”Prayers can do wonders. They can heal and help you recover. They can transform you and inspire you to do good or better for yourself and others. Try praying simple prayers, such as: “Thank you, God.” “Thank you, Jesus.” “Lord, help me…(mention what you hope/want to see/be done in your life).”Wherever you are, keep on praying, stay focused and don’t give up.“Pray, hope and don’t worry. Pray with perseverance, trust and a serene and calm mind,” said Padre Pio. “Prayer is the best weapon we have; it is the key that opens God’s heart.”-Chris A.
