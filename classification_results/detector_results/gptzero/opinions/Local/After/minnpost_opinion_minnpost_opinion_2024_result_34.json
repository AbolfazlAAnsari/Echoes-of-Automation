Early childhood care is a critical educational space to create opportunity for children, and champions of early learning are committed to creating greater access to trauma-informed services in the Twin Cities every day.Think of a child’s brain like a garden. When you plant seeds — knowledge and experiences — and care for it through nurturing, learning and exploring, beautiful blooms are the result. Just like a garden, the conditions in which that nurturing takes place matter. Trauma in the form of adverse childhood experience can stunt the growth of the beautiful blooms we hope will come from the garden.Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) caused by something negative or traumatic can create lasting impacts and affect children from all walks of life.

We care for the children in a way that emphasizes their inherent resilience, teaches them coping mechanisms and guides them on a path to face these ACEs with the confidence and social-emotional skills children can develop at a young age. This practice is called trauma-sensitive care, and it is at the core of Greater Twin Cities United Way’s 80×3 initiative.The 80×3 initiative takes the latest science of early learning and applies those teaching methods to children dealing with ACEs — in particular those in marginalized or poverty-stricken communities that are most often impacted by trauma that constitutes ACEs.
