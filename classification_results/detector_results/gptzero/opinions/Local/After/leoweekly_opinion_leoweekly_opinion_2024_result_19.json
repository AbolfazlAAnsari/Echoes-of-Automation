Then I read what you said about Moore High School and thought you all were better than being racist. And Valley wasn’t much better.Kind of disappointed if I’m being honest.–Angela BrayKids at Moore H.S. of all stripes and colors wore gold teeth in the ‘80s. The yearbooks tell all tales. We’d also invite you to check the history of the South End of Louisville including Valley Station and Shively. Perhaps read about the bombing of a Black family’s home in the ‘60s.RItttenhouse SchmittenhouseI finally sat down and read through the last issue (March 27) and I really appreciated your column on the Rittenhouse event at WKU. I hate everything that criminal stands for. While many were calling for the cancellation of that event, I was uneasy about saying “Yep, cancel that talk”, and frankly until I read your column I hadn’t been able to articulate why. Now I’ve got the words, your words. Thank you. Keep writing!–Mark RountreeYour article was fantastic thank you.–Mary Nestor O’Toole*** ."
