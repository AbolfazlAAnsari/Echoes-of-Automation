They might want to visit, but few want to leave their healthcare, transportation and other basic provisional needs that are met by perhaps less insane governments.Transportation in America… Trash. Healthcare in America… Trash. Education in America… Trash, especially if you’re poor.“Do you believe,\" said Candide, \"that men have always massacred each other as they do to-day, that they have always been liars, cheats, traitors, ingrates, brigands, idiots, thieves, scoundrels, gluttons, drunkards, misers, envious, ambitious, bloody-minded, calumniators, debauchees, fanatics, hypocrites, and fools?\"’‘Do you believe,\" said Martin, \"that hawks have always eaten pigeons when they have found them?\"It is as Martin elicits, man has always been these things, and expecting better, especially from what we currently call government feels like an insurmountable battle.Perhaps our battle isn’t with the foam on the beer but the beer itself.“A State can be no better than the citizens of which it is composed. Our labour now is not to mould States, but make citizens,” Voltaire said.We have so much work to do. We’re coming upon an election of proportions so ridiculous that many of us feel like any choice is no choice at all, so what do we do?Do we let the ship sink and bail? At what point do we leave the saving for saviors and just let this mess be a mess?I wish I had an answer. For now, I’m just trying to keep myself out of a depression so dark that it consumes me.
