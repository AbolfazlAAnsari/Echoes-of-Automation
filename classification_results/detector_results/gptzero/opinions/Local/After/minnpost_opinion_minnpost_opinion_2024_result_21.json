In most families, rent or mortgage payments are the single largest expense. It’s also deeply emotional because our homes are the center of our lives.Housing insecurity is a widespread problem affecting millions of people across the country. Rising housing costs, stagnant wages and a shortage of affordable homes have created a crisis impacting families and individuals from all walks of life. According to recent data compiled by Harvard University, nearly one-third of U.S. households are cost burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing. Overcrowding, eviction, and homelessness are stark realities for many.To address the housing crisis, we need to focus on several critical areas. First, there is an urgent need for more affordable housing options. This includes expanding low-income housing, subsidizing rent and creating pathways to homeownership for those with limited means. It also means building more homes of all kinds because housing supply still hasn’t caught up to demand since the 2008 housing crash. Second, housing alone is not enough. Support services such as mental health care, job training and substance abuse programs are essential for helping individuals and families achieve stable housing. Third, we need stronger legal protections for renters and homeowners to prevent unjust evictions and foreclosures, allowing people to stay in their homes during difficult times.We must embrace evidence-based best practices for each segment of the housing continuum. The gold standard for helping folks out of homelessness is the “Housing First” approach. It prioritizes permanent housing for previously homeless individuals without preconditions, like sobriety, ensuring they have a stable base from which to rebuild their lives. It also provides critical access to services when people need them most.Preventing housing insecurity in the first place is even better. This includes Minnesota state programs like Homework Starts with Home and other rental assistance programs. Inclusionary zoning is another good option that mandates a percentage of new housing developments be affordable for low- and moderate-income families. Finally, community land trusts are a great option for long-term sustainable development. Creating community owned land ensures long-term affordability and prevents displacement, which helps to preserve local character and agency.While I no longer live in St. Anthony Park, my life still largely revolves around the neighborhood. It’s where I work and where my parents, grandparents and many dear friends still live. As a community, we’ve had a challenging set of conversations related to housing. The latest round was sparked by Luther Seminary’s former plan to use the vacant Stub Hall as an emergency shelter. However, community interest and concerns about development on Luther’s campus and throughout the neighborhood are not new.Years ago, I wrote a paper on multigenerational family housing. I chose the topic in part because I grew up in close proximity to my grandparents, and I was curious if there were any concrete benefits, outside of those I had anecdotally experienced. I found there are many positives for both children and elders. The most popular multigenerational housing options in the United States are “in-law suites” and auxiliary dwelling units. Separated spaces help decrease conflict in multigenerational households. I’ve been thrilled to see the zoning laws in both Minneapolis and St. Paul opened up to ADUs over the last eight years. I believe this has been a major reason we were one of the first areas of the country to get inflation under control by mitigating some of the spike in housing costs.I now live in Hamline-Midway with my partner and our two cats. Our house is next to a housing first building. We quite literally have supportive housing next to our backyard. I won’t sugar coat it. Dealing with litter and other trash in and around our property is a regular issue. I have installed security cameras, built a fence and called the building’s security team on more than one occasion. It’s still all worth it. We’ve gotten to know our neighbors and we work to share information and support one another. We have a strong community here in Hamline-Midway and I look forward to seeing how it flourishes in the years to come.St. Anthony Park is not Hamline-Midway. SAP has different geography, culture and opportunities. But if we want St. Anthony Park to be vibrant in the future, we also need to evolve. “Gentle density” — the addition of units across a wide area — works well with the character of SAP. However, there are certainly areas where larger buildings could also fit, such as along major arteries like Highway 280 and Larpenteur Avenue. Putting four-story residential and “mixed-use” buildings on these corridors will boost the size of the tax base, provide better funding for SAP Elementary and Murray Middle School, and create space for more families of many kinds to live in “the Park.”We don’t need to fear density. More people is good for local businesses. There is scant evidence that more units will reduce home values. In fact, it generally seems to modestly increase home values in a desirable area near an urban core.It’s time to take real action to ensure everyone has access to a safe, stable and affordable place to live. Our homes are the foundation of our lives, and housing should be a right, not a privilege. I love St. Anthony Park. I want to see it thrive as a community in the decades and centuries to come. I believe the best way to make that happen is to invest in our neighborhood by building more homes, growing more food, and producing more energy while using less. People of all ages and incomes should be able to make St. Anthony Park home.Liam Magistad lives in St. Paul."
