Tovi had died two weeks prior, breeding an impulsivity in me that no intervention could interrupt. I was sure adopting another dog would sedate my debilitating pain.The day after he died, I frantically dragged my husband to three shelters and cried when no one came home with us.Tovi was the closest thing to a soulmate I’ve ever had. He was there for me during my tumultuous 20s, and having him as a stable presence forced me to grow up. We lived in nine places, took road trips and hiked countless trails. He walked me down the aisle and gave me away to a man I would later divorce. At my second wedding, in lieu of flowers, I walked down the aisle carrying a bully stick and gently handed it to the “Best Dog.” I grieved not only for Tovi but also the life he had represented, the memories he held. The “before.”I had a checklist. Through Petfinder, I found dogs in foster care meeting my criteria, only to find out that the dog had been adopted. Like a desperate buyer in a seller’s market, my heart sank every time. Racing to yet another shelter, I spotted a volunteer in the parking lot carrying a 5-month-old puppy. Knowing nothing about this dog, other than she broke my age rule, it was as if I yelled, “Dibs!” With my checkboxes blank, I went against my rational intent of making an informed decision. As most rebounds do, Millie seemed good enough.Millie needed to be spayed before her official adoption. Over the days as I waited to take her home, my mind slowed down. My gut screamed I was making a terrible mistake. I was too ashamed to call the shelter and abandon my commitment, so I dismissed the same voice that warned me two weeks before my first wedding not to get married. Once I adopted her, the thought of bringing her back to the shelter was not something I could entertain. I was sure the shelter would put me on some sort of “do not adopt” list and I would never get a dog.My gut proved right. Millie wasn’t the comforting presence I sought. I was an emotional disaster. I needed support. I had nothing to give, yet here I was, responsible for this dog. I’m not sure what part of my grief was worse: the life I lost or the life I would soon be living.Millie felt like an unwelcome intruder; only, I let her in. At home, she was loving. Outside, she was a troubled dog: fearful, aggressive at times, with a noise phobia that quickly ended walks. The blank checkboxes haunted me.On walks, fearful of anyone she didn’t know and unsure of how she would react, I would introduce her from a distance as my “new dog” and not let anyone near her. I would emotionally vomit on strangers about how I had the most incredible dog before her. As if to prove I once had that dog.Millie was a constant reminder of my impulsivity, filling me with resentment at every glance. I went through the motions of being the quintessential dog mom. When the superficial wasn’t helping, I sought months of therapy in hopes of breaking through the invisible fence between us.If we were in a relationship, I would have ended things after realizing we weren’t a good fit. I would tell her, “It’s not you; it’s me,” and mean it with all my heart. I would move on from my rebound, and she would be devastated.Over the years, with the help of behaviorists (and Prozac), Millie made steady progress. I devoted my life to loving her, being her advocate and keeping her from triggers. I was her person from day one. We shared Prozac, literally. Sometimes we borrowed from each other if the other was late on a refill; “Millie owes Liz (x) Prozac” is scribbled on the whiteboard in the kitchen.In relationships, I’ve always lived by the motto, “Every time we fall in love, it’s a different experience.” They say you’re lucky if you have one great love in your life. I had that love.Short of five years into our relationship, Millie was diagnosed with cancer. My initial reaction? Ecstatic. I thought about the new dog I would get and how peaceful life would be with that dog. I was then laden with remorse, and the thought passed as quickly as it came. I finally saw her as the dog she’d grown into, not the dog I adopted years ago. She was the dog I couldn’t sleep without. The dog who learned to love hiking. The endearingly shy dog who allowed people to touch her. Despite chemotherapy, Millie died six weeks later. I was devastated, but it would be cliche not to confess that there was also a sense of relief. I no longer carried the fear of liabilities, the forgoing of vacations and the countless “what ifs” that fueled my anxiety.In time, with intention, I will adopt another dog and fall in love in yet another distinct way. For now, the words “Millie owes Liz 8 Prozac” remain on the whiteboard and, perhaps, always will.Elizabeth Weiner is a creative writer who has a master’s in counseling psychology and lives in Maryland.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.
