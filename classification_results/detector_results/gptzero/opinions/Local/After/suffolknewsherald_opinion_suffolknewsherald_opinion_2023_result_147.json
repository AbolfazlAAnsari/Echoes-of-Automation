A prize of $25,000 for the best plan to bring (legal) alcohol back into the country was the leading headline on Jan. 2, 1929.William Randolph Hearst, owner of multiple newspapers, issued the challenge via his newspapers. The call was for “a more liberal and more American measure,” with the article going on to explain the impossibility of enforcing Prohibition. Despite this interesting measure to find a solution, prohibition and the raids and arrests of bootleggers would populate the news pages for another four years.On Feb. 27, 1929, the newspaper announced a reunion resulting from a letter from a woman in England searching for her family. As a 6-year-old child, Carrie Rountree had been taken back to England by her adopted mother. She grew up knowing she had older siblings, but not knowing their names. According to the story, Carrie sent a letter to theNews-Heraldthat was then published, and within hours of the paper hitting the streets, calls came flooding in. Mrs. J.L. Johnson, who at the time lived on Pinner Street, was overjoyed to discover the little sister she and her siblings thought dead was alive and well in England.Newspapers were the primary source of information and communication for decades. The turn of the decade would see that idea, and many more, challenged.In 1929, the first public demonstration of color television was held, by H.E. Ives and his colleagues at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York City. The first images are a bouquet of roses and an American flag. Less than two years later, the first TV commercial appeared.Characters such as Betty Boop, Mickey Mouse and the Looney Tunes appeared for the first time.
