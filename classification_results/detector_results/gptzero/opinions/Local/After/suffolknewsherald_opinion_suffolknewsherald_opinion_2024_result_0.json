Any veteran who had served since 1897 was permitted to seek care.One of our readers kindly referred us to the Maritime Injury Center which focuses somewhat on Merchant Mariners, but has a ton of great information and resources for vets and merchant mariners alike. These range from advice on military and maritime careers to civilian transition, maritime law, mental health, continued education and much more.   It might be of use to veterans who were in the sea services.  Check it out https://www.maritimeinjurycenter.com/.Veterans can now make appointments at the VA using the MyHealthVet link to VA.gov appointments.  (https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/ss20231103-try-appointments-va) If you have not subscribed to this site, we suggest you do so immediately; it is a portal to a number of VA resources for veterans in their system. (https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/user-registration).  This might be a simpler way to request your VA appointments than running the phone options gauntlet when you call Hampton or another VA center.  You can currently login directly, but next year it will be through VA.gov. More on that in a future Veterans Corner.Over the years PTSD, or posttraumatic stress disorder, has been known as shell shock, combat fatigue, or battle fatigue (https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/what/ptsd_basics.asp). Although PTSD is often linked with combat, not all PTSD is combat-related.  Any experience that threatens your life or someone else’s can cause PTSD.  Some changes that come with aging may make a veteran feel more vulnerable, making PTSD symptoms more noticeable.  Aging can cause symptoms to come back after many years or even occur for the first time. The PTSD Coach App is available to any veteran or family member to learn more, view treatments and ways to manage symptoms. https://mobile.va.gov/app/ptsd-coach  One feature we recommend is a self-assessment capability for anyone reluctant to directly approach a healthcare provider with their concerns.  Related to PTSD is individual feelings of being all alone..The VA through its Million Veteran Program has recognized that America, particularly some Veterans, has a loneliness epidemic.  Without getting into the details on this, we want to emphasize to our Veteran readers that there are any number of Veteran’s Service Organization within which they will find a common bond and fellowship.  We have featured before those such as Disabled Veterans, Vietnam Veterans and, of course, our organizations: the American Legion and VFW.  Google any of these, find a local chapter or post, visit and join if you feel comfortable.  All offer a context for camaraderie amongst your fellow veterans.Thomas Mastaglio is an Army veteran who serves as media officer at American Legion Post 49.
