If someone were to have told me pre-COVID that trying to buy a bike, boat, camping supplies, or any outdoor equipment would be almost impossible here in Colorado, and nationwide, I would have most likely made some dismissive and derogatory comment. Guess I’m eating my words now.\nFor many mountain towns and businesses, COVID-19 has equated to a boon in business. Bike shops are for the most part sold out, many athletic stores have experienced supply chain delays, and even REI and Cabela’s have empty shelves. In many ways, COVID-19 has incited a trend in enjoying the outdoors.\nThe Outdoor Industry Association (OIA) recently provided information stating, “Americans took up new activities in significant numbers in April, May and June of 2020. Among the biggest gainers were running, cycling and hiking.” For those who were on the trails and enjoying parks and open spaces last year, it was abundantly apparent that a cooped-up population yearned to be outside.\nGo figure, it took a pandemic to shock people into a new and different mindset. The pandemic created screen fatigue, which was the perfect impetus to leverage people to get outside.\nThe desire to get out is not just for younger generations. Over the past couple of months, I have had a number of clients ask our office to research and purchase them pedometers — step-tracking devices. One client, a 93-year-old, said they were motivated to track steps after reading this article in the Journal of the American Medical Association:Association of Daily Step Count and Step Intensity With Mortality Among US Adults.\nThe following synopsis provided by Providence Health reviews a study conducted by Harvard Health in \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Description: Primary Responsibility Supervisory/Management Manage the Department of Strategic Initiatives, which includes various externally funded program...\nHOA Accountant Full-Time Position Salary: 75k-90K Benefits include Medical/Dental/Vision, PTO, 401k, annual bonuses, and others Frias Properties of Aspen Sn...\nWE ARE HIRING!
