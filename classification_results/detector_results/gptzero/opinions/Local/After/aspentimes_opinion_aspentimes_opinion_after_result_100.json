Shortly thereafter and across our mountain region, early doses were being administered in area hospitals, pharmacies and clinics — often by Colorado Mountain College nursing graduates. A sense that the worst was behind us characterized the final weeks of 2020.\nAs we know, 2021 has now come and (nearly) gone without the “return to normal” we had eagerly anticipated. Even so, all of us at CMC have reflected deeply, adapted and evolved in order to support our students and return on the investments our beloved mountain communities make in us. With CMC’s fall semester coming to a close, it’s an opportunity to share some highlights from that journey, and what has made it possible.\nFor instance, despite the seemingly endless twists and turns of an ever-evolving public health crisis, CMC graduated one of its largest classes ever in May. Over the summer, thinking the other side of the pandemic was in reach and given extremely high voluntary vaccination rates among employees, we planned for the fall term and welcomed students back to a fully “open” environment.\nHowever, as August approached, we saw worrying signs that conditions were not as promising as projected. Enrollments were unpredictable and weaker than historical patterns, suggesting that students were still hesitant about investing in the future. Employees reported extreme difficulty securing affordable housing and child care, further destabilizing the region’s full-time workforce. And, an even more virulent strain of the virus gained a foothold just as classes began.\nConsequently, CMC pivoted (again). Our talented team of faculty and staff leaned into the headwinds and successfully launched another semester. Our intrepid students were right there with us. Together, we masked-up (again) and hunkered down (again).\nWhile the pandemic pushed some colleges and universities across the country to close or merge, CMC’s unique localized funding model, operational structure and personalized approach allowed the college to withstand extreme fiscal pressures. In fact, we were able to invest even more deeply in our students and build programs that support our region’s greatest workforce needs.\nWe took advantage of historically low interest rates and launched a major, multi-community investment in student housing, a win-win given our students often have .
