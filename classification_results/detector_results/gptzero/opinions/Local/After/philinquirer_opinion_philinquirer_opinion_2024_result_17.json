As someone who follows issues of Pennsylvania school funding, the obstructionist and delay tactics of Republican lawmakers are giving me an ominous sense of déjà vu.As a professor at Swarthmore College, I often tell my students that we study the history of education policies and the actions of policymakers so we’re not doomed to repeat the same inequitable decisions of the past. Understanding this history helps us respond in the current moment.Racial disparities in Pennsylvania school funding first came to light during the2014 Basic Education Funding Commission hearings. David Mosenkis, a data scientist and member ofPOWER Interfaith, a racial justice organizing group, testified to his finding that whiter school districts received more state funding than majority-minority districts, when controlling for poverty and other factors. The finding that Pennsylvania distributes school funding in ways that privilege whiter school districts has been confirmed byother studies.After Mosenkis’ testimony, Republican State Sen. Pat Browne, cochair of the first Basic Education Funding Commission in 2014, responded the way a politician in a public setting would be expected to: surprise and a promise to do better. Browne stated that he didn’t want funding formulas “to have any unintended consequences, because at a minimum level, it sends a bad public policy message.” He added that “there’s no reason in regards to what we do in the future that should continue to allow that.”And yet, shortly after the first commission issued its report, Pennsylvania’s Republican-led General Assembly enacted a law that preserved racial inequities in school funding. Although the2016 law, based on the commission’s recommendations, adopted a “fair” funding formula, the fine print dictated that the formula would only be applied to new money (i.e., increases to the state education budget). In 2017–2018, this meant that only 8% of the total education budget wasdistributed “fairly”— that is, in a racially equitable manner.Tactics to evade the implementation of racially equitable school funding policies are part of Harrisburg culture and are common enough outside of Pennsylvania that education scholars refer to these as the “tricks of the trade” of state legislators.Another “trick of the trade” included the use of not-nearly-enough “earmarked funding” to specific underfunded districts. The practice, according to state legislators, has been around for decades but onlydrew scrutiny in 2013. Earmarked funding was a poorly constructed stopgap effort that diverted attention away from the systemic problem of educational underfunding. It pacified constituents by giving the appearance that legislators were fighting for school funding when, in reality, it was a sloppily adhered Band-Aid. Browne was able to secure multiple years of earmarked funding for his underfunded school district in Allentown. So much state legislative activity produced so little change.To be sure, therecent Basic Education Funding Commission reporthas more to recommend than its previous counterpart. For one, it acknowledges that there is a significant gap between what Pennsylvania currently provides and what is needed for an adequate education. And it attached a figure — $5.4 billion — to plug the adequacy gap, though this is still less than the$6.2 billioncalculated by Matthew Kelly, a Pennsylvania State University professor.But today’s Republican lawmakers are up to their “tricks of the trade” again, finding ways to maintain the racial school funding status quo, despite the Commonwealth Court’s 2023 ruling that Pennsylvania’s school funding system isunconstitutional and in need of reform.In a move to delay and undermine racial equity in Pennsylvania school funding, Republican commission members voted against the final report, issuing their ownbootleg version.
