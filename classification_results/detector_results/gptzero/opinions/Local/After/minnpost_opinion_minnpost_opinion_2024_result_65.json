It’s also much more convenient, and effective, for a senior than a full-blown ER visit.The key is to make sure our medical field staff is trained and equipped to evaluate the urgency of medical care. Our teams divide medical requests into five levels of triage, with Level 5 serving as an actual medical crisis that requires immediate ER care, while Level 3-4 are more urgent issues that can be treated by a paramedic or nurse at home, and level 1- 2 by our trained triage team of nurses.Seniors who have been served by our at-home system don’t have to deal with the complications that come with a trip to a medical office, including the battle with traffic, mobility challenges of getting from the car to the facility, and the exposure to viruses, bacteria, and other illnesses that come with sick patients in medical facilities.But in-home health offers advantages to medical providers, too.

Seniors are usually guarded and not fully candid when visiting a doctor in an office, but in their home our medical professionals tend to hear more honest takes on their true condition. Home visits also allow our paramedics and nurses to evaluate the social determinants of health that sometimes carry greater weight than any professional medical treatment. Is the senior living in a safe place, with enough food, and a caring community?Another big plus of home visits is the ability to know seniors as a person instead of a collection of health issues. We understand their medical contingency plans and their advance care wishes. Even better, we know the emotional importance of upcoming life events, such as the marriage of their granddaughter next month.In some cases, when one of our seniors does go to the hospital with a Level 5 immediate medical crisis, we join them to help sort through the web of prescribed treatments and rehabilitation. This helps reduce the compartmentalization of medical care and puts us on the same page as the seniors.Community medical care isn’t just for private medical providers. Public safety and health officials inOregonandColoradoalso are reporting success providing on-site care for younger people with mental health and substance abuse issues.For decades, Americans have viewed at-home health care as a relic of a bygone era, like old reruns of Marcus Welby M.D. on a nostalgia cable TV channel. But sometimes the old ways carry solutions for modern times. At-home medicine for seniors is an idea whose time has come again.Pete Carlson is vice president of acute response services atLifespark, a Minnesota complete senior care company."
