We met them all.A yard sale is a lot of work. A first requirement is to decide what stuff, things and personal junk you want to get rid of — I mean sell. No one really wants your junk — those things you’re fed up with or that conjure bad vibes or remind you of your awful or evil past. Nor do they want the long explanations that go with them.Your stuff and your things, however, can be displayed anywhere, anytime because they just might sell. A few nice dresses near the side-walk, LP records for hipsters, an electric mower front and center. Just kidding. Get customers inside the perimeter. “Hi, haven’t seen you for a while.” Sales just might happen.But care is needed; you can’t betooforthcoming. You watch. More than a glance at an item can be promising. It happened more than once with the electric mower and led to openings for talk about lawn care, the environmental advantages of electric power, etc. I talked.But a lawn mower that doesn’t run is just a pile of junk. I had convinced myself that all that was needed was an inexpensive repair; someone who knew electricity would come along and give it a thought. No go. I mentioned the pricey batteries I was throwing in that worked. Not lure enough. “It ran like a charm last fall,” I said. “I have the service records.” But it didn’t run now, and all attempts to sell went zippo. The lawnmower sits in the garage. I’ll call DeWalt to find out about salvage.But there were successes, too. An old bike sold, some heavy tools, two worn out radios, a partial chemistry set separated from the University of Minnesota chemistry department, and my dad’s duck-hunting waders.People kept coming. The bike sold to a young guy who, it turns out, is our new mailman. Lives close buy, so I met a new neighbor and even dropped the price a bit for him. A soft heart can sell stuff, but it doesn’t negotiate well.Some CDs sold. More than one visitor wanted them, and if we had put out our old vinyl sets, we could have cleaned up. “Do you have records for sale?” Maybe next time, because while we do have long-playing records, we didn’t have time to sort through them for those we’d let go. Letting go is a big part of any successful lawn sale.Pushing 80 years old, I should be less attached to stuff and things. My junk’s another story. I fretted about selling some of my dad’s belongings, though. One item in particular — his ancient duck hunting waders — gave me pause. Heavy as hell, perhaps just another item in the electric lawn mower category, they came up to a tall man’s armpits and who knew how functional they were. But still, I believed they’d be a fit for someone, maybe in another realm, and lo and behold.One more new neighbor showed up. A recent retiree, public-school art teacher and outdoorsy sort, he lifted the waders and appeared downright joyful. He marveled at the condition they were in after 80 years. They don’t make rubber waders like that anymore.He had a use for them, too. I smelled sale. His family goes to the Maine woods every summer to work building a cabin. The cabin sits on land with a small pond, he told me, which for whatever reason needed to be cleaned. He tried on the waders. My new friend was concerned the waders wouldn’t fit his size 12+ feet. But my father was a big man. Voila! Perfecto!I imagined the retiree wader clad, pulling cattails and noxious weeds, throwing them left and right. Here comes an old bedspring, a car muffler out of that pond, and he’s wearing my dad’s waders. Immersed in the muck, loving it.Robin Wall Kimmerer in “Braiding Sweetgrass” tells a story of how she and her students mucked in a pond to clean and restore it to vitality and to help plant and animal life flourish. I imagined my new friend doing the same in dad’s waders, giving them a new lease on life by connecting them again to nature, and serving another man’s dreams of balance and contentment.Yard sales are not only work, for there is joy in becoming more acquainted with people you might not have known lived close by. Good memories, too, in the stuff and things you put out. But be careful with the junk.
