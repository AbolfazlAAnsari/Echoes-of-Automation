Between the 2021 and 2022 sessions, his actions ensured some $50 million of state resources made their way upriver.\nIn keeping with his decades of support for everyday working people in Lane County and across Oregon, Holvey is the chair of the House Business and Labor Committee, and strongly supported advancing a bill to ensure that projects built with public dollars prioritize local employers hiring local employees and providing them with full family health insurance. He recognizes the unique role the timber economy plays in Lane County and has put forth proposals to ensure the industry pays its fair share for wildfire prevention and response, and has a keen interest in ensuring that county revenues are adequate and fair.\nHolvey has always been willing to ask the tough questions and stand up for our community. We urge the voters of HD 8 to decline to sign this recall petition. ν\nSubmitted jointly by the following current and past Lane County commissioners: Pat Farr, District 4 (current board chair),Laurie Trieger, District 3 (current board vice chair),Heather Buch, District 5;Joe Berney, former commissioner for District 2;Bill Dwyer, former commissioner District 2;Bobby Green, former commissioner District 4;Pete Sorenson, former commissioner District 3;Faye Stewart, former commissioner District 5.\n"
