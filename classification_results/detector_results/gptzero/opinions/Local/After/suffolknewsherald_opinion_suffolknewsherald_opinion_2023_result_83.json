This season also has spiritual implications that speak of revitalization.Spring has become my favorite season as it transitions into new beginnings after the winter months when aspects of death occur in nature. During this season, it’s nice to get up in the morning hearing birds chirping and to travel throughout the day seeing flowers blooming. Although the official start of spring is not until March 20, it is refreshing to experience longer periods of sunlight with Daylight Savings Time.Sights and sounds of nature present at spring remind me of encouraging Scripture that centers around the blessing of God’s provision, the beauty of His creation and the assuredness of His sovereignty. Luke 12: 24 – 28 encourages me to consider that if God provides for the birds and He clothes the flowers, how much more will He do for me as His follower.
