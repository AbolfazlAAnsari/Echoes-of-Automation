Maher was referring to Suess’ fall from grace for being racially insensitive.\nMaher should think again about Americans, considering the sales bonanza enjoyed by shunned classics, including six books canceled by Dr. Suess Enterprises, epic film “Gone with The Wind” and Mr. Potato Head.\nThough securing freedom of choice with our wallets, Americans must wage a fuller-throated defense of the American Idea, that a diverse people can forge a freer and fairer nation by hashing out differences civilly.\nEven prominent French politicians and intellectuals fear America’s illiberal social theories, which prominent African American academic Glenn Loury called “a formula for tyranny and more racism” in his recent Congressional testimony.\nIt’s an apt description considering efforts to cancel Shakespeare and Beethoven for being white men. Same for the forced resignations of Alexi McCammond, Teen Vogue’s black editor-in-chief, over her teenage tweets, and 45-year New York Times science reporter Donald McNeil Jr. for repeating the N-word when asked about it.\nActor Ralph Fiennes recently denounced our “age of accusation” while defending J.K. Rowling, who’s accused of transphobia. It’s “disturbing,” the “hatred that people express about views that differ from theirs, and the violence of language towards others.”\nMere plebeians have no such defense, as detailed in a NYT story about Smith College, where service workers earning less than one year’s tuition were falsely accused of racially profiling a student.\nNevertheless, Smith launched obligatory and accusatory antibias training so unbearable, Jodi Shaw — a self-described liberal and Smith graduate — recently resigned her administrative post, refusing a settlement to “remain silent.”\nHer resignation letter is an indictment of our dehumanizing, illiberal and neo-racist moment in which “people’s worth is determined by the color of their skin,” and “failing to swear fealty … is grounds for public humiliation and professional retaliation.”\nHaving chosen freedom over comfort and legal recourse, Shaw wrote, “My children’s future, and indeed, our collective future as a free nation, depends on people having the courage to stand up to this dangerous and divisive ideology.”\nShaw’s efforts reflect the ideas of philosopher Karl Popper, who coined Paradox of Tolerance in 1945: “In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance,” countering the intolerant “by rational argument and keep(ing) them in check by public opinion.”\nCan we check intolerance amid the “new McCarthyism” and the self-censorship it induces? Yes, when silent majorities speak out, like falling dominoes, they’ll recover human dignity and civility. Just as our bodies and spirits crave liberation from quarantine, so do our minds and voices.\nBut “civility is more than good manners,” the late Rabbi Jonathan Sacks wrote in “Morality: Restoring the Common Good in Divided Times.” Civility “is a recognition that listening respectfully to your opponents is a necessary part of the politics of a free society; and that liberal democracy, predicated … on the dignity of diversity, must keep the peace between contending groups by honoring us all equally, in both our diversity and our commonalities.”\nCivility means speaking to the better angels of our nature, recognizing Soviet dissident Alexandre Solzhenitsyn’s insight that “the line \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail resumes to: ricardo@cprestaurants.com...\nSeeking FT Operations Manager for high end homecare division of Hansen Construction.
