With a few notable exceptions, such as newsy reports from my mother and a near-perfect epistle penned by my eighth-grade educated paternal grand-mother wintering in Harlingen, Texas, they were from friends, girlfriends and ex-girlfriends-become-just-friends — all in their early to late 20s, my own age during that time.My first thought on rereading the letters was what a treasure technology has taken away from us. In those days, non-local phone calls were labeled “long-distance” and charged exorbitantly, particularly after three minutes. Emails, texts and mobile phone conversations existed only in the crazed minds of techies and a few far-sighted investors. Unlike those near-instant and quickly erased communiques, the act of putting thoughts to paper allowed writers more time and space to recall memories, assemble thoughts and express fears and hopes and for recipients to first read and then preserve the same for reading again another day.Confusion on life goals was a common theme among my chroniclers. I suppose that’s to be expected in any era among 20-somethings. They’ve recently cut loose from parents and academic institutions, often without a stable relationship and working on one of their first full-time jobs.For my 1970s letter writers, add to that the change-the-world impulse that was all around then because of Vietnam War protests and various civil rights and anti-poverty movements. The result was an almost universal sentiment in the letters that “I have to do something” about the mess the world is in.For example, one fellow law student wrote from a 1972 summer law-firm job in Louisville that she found law to be too constraining and wanted to work on the McGovern campaign. (She finished law school instead and, at age 76, according to Google, is still practicing public interest law in Kentucky.) Two others, both teachers, were tired of the slow progress of learning and wanted to follow me to law school. (Luckily, they didn’t. One was later named North Carolina’s Teacher of the Year and the other became a school superintendent and a well-regarded consultant to school boards around the country.)The letters also reflected lots of upheaval, both on social and personal levels.A set reminded me that FBI agents interviewed my mother because a friend was suspected of being responsible for the August 1970 bombing of the old federal building in Minneapolis (now the Paul Wellstone Federal Building), which then served as a site for both draft physicals and military inductions. When I told my friend about the FBI’s suspicions, he denied any involvement and pointed out that, because of a new job, he had recently cut his hair and shaved and now “looked like a Republican.” I doubt my friend, a terrible klutz, could have successfully lit a firecracker, much less ignite a bomb. Incidentally, nobody was ever arrested for the bombing despite a $25,000 reward offered by KSTP-TV.One friend, then aged 26, complained of married life. From a previous relationship his beloved new wife had a special-needs 4-year-old requiring a great deal of attention and my friend said the effort to care for the child amounted for him to “a long painful strangulation.” He asked, “How can I have my freedom and not harm a person I love very deeply?” (The couple divorced several years later.)On the other side of parenting, a female friend I had known while living in Washington, D.C., wrote from Tennessee, praising both the Lamaze method of childbirth and the joys of breastfeeding for both mother and baby.
