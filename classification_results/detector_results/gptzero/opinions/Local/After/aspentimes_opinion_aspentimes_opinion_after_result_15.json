On the lower half of the Meatgrinder Rapid, Chason flipped over and missed the very narrow window of opportunity to “roll” his kayak upright again before he began dropping into the next rocky section of whitewater.\nI assume during this section that he was upside down, Chason took a hard blow to the helmet and felt the need to eject himself from his kayak. Chason has been kayaking for over 25 years and has only “swam” out of his boat once or twice, an incredible fact and a testament to just how good a kayaker he was.\nUpon “swimming” out of his boat, Stan was immediately with Chason and attempting to rescue his partner.  Chason was never lost.  Stan Prichard was by his side the entire time.  Stan brought his boat to within Chason’s reach and made contact and began paddling him to shore.\nThe two went through another “hole” or large rapid, which caused Stan’s boat to flip.  The two lost contact at the time and Stan “rolled” his boat back upright to see Chason get flushed over the next river feature and submerge completely.  He saw Chason begin to rise and then stop just shy of the surface. We know now that Chason’s leg became stuck in an “entrapment,” or lodged between rocks that held him in place.\nStan whipped his kayak into the “eddy” or slack water just behind Chason and attempted to make contact again. The situation became quite dangerous for Stan, as during the ensuing efforts he lost his paddle while attempting to make contact with Chason and had to paddle to shore by hand.  Once on shore he made every effort to get a rope to Chason but too much time had past and Chason remained stuck and had become unresponsive.\nThe effort that Stan put into saving his friend cannot be overstated.  In the end, Chason was lost to kayaking.  He had spent the entirety of his life pursuing the sport all over the world.  Kayaking and skiing were his passions and nothing made him happier than being on the water in all its forms with his friends and loved ones.  He was truly a river otter in human form.\nAs the news spread Friday morning, his friends from around the state began to travel toward Redstone. We arrived throughout the afternoon to be together and console each other in a time of hardship.  Upon arrival it became clear that Chason would not be recovered by any formal entity, Sherrif’s Office, Search and Rescue, or otherwise.  It was Stan Prichard’s firm opinion that Chason never became dislodged from his entrapment and was still in the same basic location.
