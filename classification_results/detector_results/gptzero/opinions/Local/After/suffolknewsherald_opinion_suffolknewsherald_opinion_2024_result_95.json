Meanwhile, oligarchs have thrived from the First Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe, particularly in the UK. Yet, their dominance was being challenged by regional powers, and America, the emerging power, stepped onto the side stage in the initial phase of the Great War. America’s fate in the 20th century was sealed when the nation, torn between isolationism and interventionism, was swayed by the British to defend their cause.The declining British Empire recognized the need to reshape the political and cultural influence surrounding America’s pride in its 1776 independence. It aimed to establish an Anglo-American presence on American soil, influencing the United States’ foreign policy towards Europe. Consequently, Cecil Rhodes, an Oxford figurehead and English colonialist, founded the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford University. His intention was to recapture the minds of American statesmen and “reintegrate the USA as an integral part of the British Empire,” as outlined in his 1877 will. Rhodes bequeathed his wills and amassed fortunes to select members of his Rhodes Society, a group whose key members and objectives were chronicled by Dr. Carrol Quigley in ‘The Anglo-American Establishment.’America experienced cultural and political infiltration by the British Empire. According to Harvard scholar Dr. Quigley, elite individuals were dispatched by the Rhodes Society after completing their Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford. They established themselves in American politics, business, and academia. According to Quigley, a notable figure among them was Frank Aydelotte, an influential American Rhodes Scholar and society member. Aydelotte, pivotal in opening the American mindset to British perspectives, championed globalism centered on British superiority post-WWII. His tenure as a Rhodes Scholar from 1905-1907 marked the beginning, but not the end, of such influential figures. Subsequent generations have seen key Rhodes Scholars occupy significant positions in American government.
