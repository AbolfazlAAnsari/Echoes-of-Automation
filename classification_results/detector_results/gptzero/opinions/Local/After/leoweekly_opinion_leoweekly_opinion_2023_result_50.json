Established in 2001, Sexual Assault Awareness Month has raised public awareness and educated over two decades worth of college students on sexual assault prevention. While prevention trends in the month of April, a handful of local schools have added yearlong lessons on sexual misconduct to their curriculum in efforts to prepare their students for their journey in higher education. This month, we look at two more schools that have stepped to the front line.Walden SchoolFor Pam Zipper, sexual assault prevention education plays a vital role in a student’s education, especially in the post-pandemic world. “With the pandemic’s in-person learning restrictions, our students got a little behind socially,” said Zipper, the 7th – 12th grade director at the Walden School. “So now that we are back in the classroom, we need to help catch them up and close the gaps,” she continues. “What is sexual misconduct, sexual harassment, and consent? These are the conversations we need to be having.”And for Zipper, the sooner these conversations are had, the better.As The Walden School has students from K-12, Zipper is able to start teaching these lessons as early as eighth grade. In an introductory workshop, eighth and ninth grade students learn how their current actions have consequences that follow them into adulthood. Zipper said the purpose of educating students this young is to prepare them for their adult life. “By the time students reach adulthood, media has sent millions of messages, sending them in the wrong direction,” she said. “We approach students in a way where they don’t feel threatened by the information, but they are still educated and the earlier we do it, the better adults we are putting into this world.”As for her upper classmen, sophomores learn about the bystander effect and the mechanics of intervention, while juniors and seniors participate in sessions on consent. “Consent on a foundational level is easy to define,” said Zipper. “But it is important for students to take into account all of the different variables present when they find themselves in an actual situation.”With these workshops set to be a regular fixture at the school, it’s hoped that sexual misconduct prevention will be an embedded skill by graduation. “We sometimes wait too late to have these very important conversations, sometimes not having them until the students are adults, and to me, that’s way too late,” said Zipper. “We need to start having these conversations more and more so we can help our students navigate these uncharted waters.St. Xavier High SchoolAt St. Xavier High School, sexual misconduct prevention is closely aligned with the school’s principles. “Our standards as a Catholic school includes teaching students responsibility for self, ethical decision making, advocacy skills, and being able to assert one’s self when necessary,” said school counselor Amber Wissing. “It is also in our school counseling standards to cover different social and emotional pieces with our students and sexual misconduct prevention is one of them,”she said.While sexual misconduct is a topic that’s taught in the school’s theology courses, the counseling department’s recent 11th and 12th grade workshops, have added elements of college culture to the comprehensive message. “It’s important that the students hear about sexual misconduct more than once and in different ways from various people,” said Wissing.
