They touted their efforts over the summer of 2023, including events, surveys, and stakeholder engagement. However, it is clear that MnDOT has not engaged with the diverse communities along the corridor. Based on its data, only one-third of respondents lived in communities along the corridor, including 691 responses from five zip codes along or near the corridor.Of the respondents, 2,518 were white, compared with only 316 residents of color. The survey was full of jargon, nearly 50 questions long, and not accessible to everyday people who aren’t transportation engineers. White college-educated men ages 25-34 had the highest number of responses, not representative of the corridor’s communities or Minnesota as a whole.Advisory committee members, including Council President Mitra Jalali (St. Paul Ward 4), Council Member Robin Wonsley (Minneapolis Ward 2), Commissioner Angela Conley (Hennepin County District 4), and state Rep. Samantha Sencer-Mura (House District 63A in Minneapolis) all raised concerns about outreach practices, calling for interventions ranging from expanded engagement to bringing in outside specialists who can engage with diverse residents living along the corridors. Making engagement accessible, with plain language and more realistic and understandable renderings, would further this goal.When raising the concern regarding a mismatch in MnDOT’s stated equity goals and outcomes, Councilor Jalali stated,“[The PAC keeps] acknowledging [the lack of equitable engagement] and not getting the results. I’m trying to underscore that I am feeling a lot of urgency around that and a desire to immediately address the practice changes that need to happen.”In a departure from previous PAC meetings, the public was only permitted to provide written comments and testimonies during the meeting. PAC meetings are one of the rare opportunities for community members to engage with elected officials and project leaders, making it an essential forum to voice perspectives and concerns. While written testimony is also valuable, the town hall forum element of this process holds critical importance, especially where project outreach fell short. MnDOT should allow public testimony at future meetings and reduce barriers to participation for people of diverse backgrounds.Many of the advisory committee members stated that their constituents had overwhelmingly opposed highway expansion along I-94. Commissioner Angela Conley echoed her constituents in fighting highway expansion, saying “ … nobody wants an expanded freeway. None of my constituents. And a lot of them are reaching out.”MnDOT’s continued inclusion of highway expansion plans also directly contradicts resolutions passed byMinneapolisandSt. Paulin 2021, which both stated their opposition to the highway’s expansion. When pressed on the matter, project leads reiterated their desire to study the entire range of options despite this proposal being directly at odds with feedback from elected officials and community members and inconsistent with MnDOT’sVehicle Miles Traveledreduction targets.Council Member Robin Wonsely captured this, stating, “… if anything, there has been a centralized conversation around how we pursue other alternatives, like highway removal.” Wonsley and other PAC members called for better communication about the at-grade proposal to expand public awareness of an option beyond our current familiarity with freeways. This confusion stems from MnDOT’s communications around the project option, where the at-grade proposal and highway removal are painted as separate possibilities but used interchangeably in the discourse around the project.Wonsley elaborated, stating, “… I will once again reiterate, I was very concerned to hear staff say that highway removal was not considered because it’s not in alignment with the project … I absolutely think that’s an inaccurate statement to make, especially when you have something somewhat similar [included in the project options]. I don’t know if it’s a redirection or a co-opting of language to not say removal because of the political implications of it.” MnDOT’s communication mismatch creates confusion and distracts from the momentum to repairhistoricandongoing harmsby replacing the highway with an alternative like theTwin Cities Boulevardcommunity vision led byOur Streets Minneapolis.MnDOT officials spent the last section of the meeting discussing examples of highway capacity reductions. This presentation was unfocused, creating more communication woes by listing highway projects from around the country that ranged from minor roadway adjustments to highway removals. These examples includedRochesterandSyracuse, New York, andDuluth, Minnesota, but little context was given and MnDOT officials upsold differences to make these examples seem less feasible despite their merits.Next StepsTechnical activities in the coming months will include refining and evaluating project alternatives and developing draft scoping documents. Engagement is also set to continue, without concrete steps to ensure more representative and equitable results. The PAC will meet again later this year as the Rethinking I-94 project continues, but it is clear that significant procedural changes are necessary at MnDOT to ensure equity and the success of the project.Joe Harrington is a student and writer in St. Paul who focuses on urban geography, transportation and environmental policy.
