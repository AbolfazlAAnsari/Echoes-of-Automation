Despite that dense humidity, concertgoers were treated to a high-energy country music spectacular. The July 13 show was the sixth stop on the tour, which began on June 28 in Bend, Oregon.Hunt sent the more than 10 thousand in attendance home, buzzing with excitement.The parking area resembled a tailgate before a college-football game, complete with pop-up tents, wafts of food cooking on grills, drinks, and familiar tailgate games like cornhole and ladder toss, setting the stage for what turned out to be an absolute dance party, both on stage and in the seats.Most people will remember Saturday, July 13, as the night of the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump’s life at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. As the news of the shooting began to filter throughout the amphitheater, fans already seated waiting for Birge to kick off the show were seen talking among themselves, sharing their phone screens with the various updates posted on the internet. None of the artists mentioned the incident, but as Hunt moved into his final song, he acknowledged the crowd trying to get a ‘USA’ chant going and welcomed them to start as they prepared for the final song, ‘Once Birge hit the stage and the first few notes of Gavin DeGraw’s ‘I Don’t Want Be’ started playing, the news out of Pennsylvania was an afterthought.The Austin, Texas native expressed his appreciation and strong connection with Virginia Beach, telling the crowd it was the first market to play his song on the radio. He also told the already charged-up crowd he was playing a brand new song called ‘Missin’ Tonight.’ A teaser for the song was filmed before the show and posted on Birges’ Instagram account.“This is the first city in America to ever play my songs on the radio,” Birge told the charged-up crowd. “ … Virginia Beach kind of feels like a second home, so it’s good to see some familiar faces out there, too,” Birge said. “And because this town’s been so good to me, I want to play y’all something brand new.
