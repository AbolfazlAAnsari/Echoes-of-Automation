No president had served more than two terms at this point. It was about a decade before the22nd Amendment was ratified and became part ofthe Constitution, restricting presidents to two terms in office.FDR was trying to break a two-term presidency tradition thatstarted with George Washington.Eleanor Roosevelt got up in front of the contentious and squabbling convention and said, “This is no ordinary time. No time for weighing anything except what we can do best for the country as a whole, and that responsibility rests on each and every one of us as individuals.”Eleanor Roosevelt’s influential speech helped reframe the first lady as a powerful advocate for the president,without being simply a mouthpiecefor him.

For the world is changing. The old era is ending. The old ways will not do,” Kennedy said.Kennedy also called for a new Americathat was not weighed down by nostalgia.Texas politician Ann Richards also supercharged her career with a Democratic National Convention keynote address in 1988. Her speech, funny and sharp, was also a commentary on the growing role of women in politics – and what an achievement it represented.In her opening words, Richards talked about Fred Astaire, one of the most famous Hollywood movie stars in the 1930s, as well as Ginger Rogers, his co-star and dance partner.“Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels,”Richards said.Richards skewered the perception that Astaire was the bigger star by pointing out Rogers was every bit as capable and talented – and even did it in uncomfortable shoes.At the time, Richards was the treasurer of Texas.
