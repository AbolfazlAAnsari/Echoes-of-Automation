Mother’s Day is now behind us for 2024. But becoming a mother isn’t about a single day — either the delivery date or the holiday. For millions of women each year, the biggest challenge about becoming a mother is the year-long mental health struggle that begins during pregnancy and continues as postpartum depression. And we are only just coming to terms with it as a society.Maternal mental health is an old problem that only recently has received recognition. We understand much more today about women’s mental health than we did even a generation ago. “Hysteria” as a condition was only formally removed as a medical diagnosis in 1980. Before we knew it as “maternal mental health,” it was the “baby blues” or even just a nameless problem chalked up to hormonal swings that one had to “shake off.”Only, too often, women haven’t shaken it off. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in eight women experience postpartum depression, and the cost is enormous. Tragically, the leading cause of death of mothers between six weeks and 12 months after birth is suicide, and about two-thirds of those deaths are among women without a previous or existing mental health condition.Other people suffer, too. Children bear the brunt, because postpartum depression interrupts the bond that women and children form, and that is so important for infant health and to lay a foundation for child development. Sadly, all too many cases of child abuse are linked to mothers struggling with their mental health. Human tragedies defy easy measurement, but statistics gathered by the non-profit Maternal Mental Health Alliance begin by putting the cost to society at over $13 billion yearly.Fortunately, we’ve made enormous progress in the last decade. In 2019, the Food and Drug Administration approved brexanolone, a drug specifically targeted to postpartum depression. Even more important, lawmakers have put money behind outreach to women, as part of the 21st Century Cures Act, signed by President Obama, in order to help get women to treatment. Medicaid has a role to play in reaching the neediest women, though this is a problem that knows no boundaries.We have only just begun to address the problem. We have begun to talk about it, yes. And we have begun to connect women to treatment, yes. But we have just scratched the surface. For one, there are too few psychiatrists, social workers and counselors out there, and it will take years for our professions to catch up to the need.But the problem was never just medical, but the American way of bearing children. If the problems were simply wild hormone swings, a pill would be enough. But it isn’t enough, not for a new mom who needs to work but can’t find child care for a newborn. It isn’t enough for new moms who cannot find a therapist in their city or town. It isn’t enough for a new mom who simply doesn’t have a network of family or friends to be there through the ups and downs. Our crisis of maternal mental health is not a unique problem but a general alarm for a society that has failed to build and maintain strong communities to support one another and especially its most vulnerable.What can be done? The first step is to keep the pressure on legislators. When the spotlight was put on maternal mental health, they were quick to respond. Moms, like apple pie, are an All-American favorite. But too many programs, like family medical leave and adequate child care, have languished. They must be seen not as luxuries, but as essential parts of a caring society.Not everyone finds that compelling, but a caring society is also a stronger society. Is it any wonder that many are concerned about declining birthrates in the United States, which leaves us an aging, less productive society? One cannot just urge people to have bigger families without doing more to support them. We must support what we value, and that begins — literally — with mom.So, no, you’re not reading this on Mother’s Day. Other holidays are right around the corner. But let’s not stop thinking about, and caring for, moms.Lea Anne Schmidt is a graduate student in social work."
