One bridge in particular stole the headlines throughout the late ’90s. In May, the official wheels went into motion to begin the replacement of the Kings Highway Bridge, a 37-year old structure that crossed the Nansemond River near Chuckatuck. According to Tom Hines, director of public works for the City of Suffolk, the structure accommodated approximately 14,000 vehicles a day and about 150 boats a week. “A lot of this traffic is due to the growth in the northern part of the city, including Virginia Power trucks who use it quite a bit. However, the bridge will only take a maximum of 18 tons of weight,” he said.While bridges over the water were getting replaced, the rivers required upkeep as well. Navigating a boat through the Bennett’s Creek channel was more easily said than done for many boating enthusiasts in July of ’97. While the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began dredging the waterway in 1992, ongoing monitoring had put up a red flag for continued passage, indicating the need for a more aggressive plan. Now “a number of citizens as well as businesses that utilize the creek have indicated their concern that the situation is becoming more problematic,” read a city staff report. “There is a concern that if the project is not undertaken before the 2001 time frame, the channel to the creek will be impassable by some boating traffic and will have a negative impact on the residents and businesses in that area.”In October of ’97, ground was broken on yet another new economic development venture.
