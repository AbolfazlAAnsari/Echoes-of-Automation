She’s shot five — the most recent was seeking refuge in a tree after the terrified animal had been chased for miles by a pack of hounds. Her victim’s skin is being made into a rug.

After gutting him, she ate a piece of his heart and smeared his blood on her face to “connect with nature.” She saved his shoulder blades, legs and jawbone.Across Ohio during the state’s two-day youth hunting season more than 10,000 white-tailed deer were killed, well above the three-year average of 7,600 between 2020 and 2022. If you believe the euphemisms, those deer were also “harvested.”“It’s fun to know that you’re the one who killed it and you’re the one who found it and you’re going to skin and dress it and all that kind of stuff,” said one 14-year-old.At a hearing in New York state about extending hunting season for 12- and 13-year-olds — in Missouri, 6-year-olds can be licensed to hunt — a state legislator cut to the chase, saying that hunting is an “economic driver” fueled by new generations of hunters and then reciting the specious argument that it’s important to “deer management.” It isn’t. When deer are killed, the subsequent spike in the food supply increases breeding among the survivors and attracts more deer. If “management” means reducing populations, hunting defeats the purpose.In Wisconsin, a newspaper columnist bemoaning the dwindling number of applicants for gun deer licenses was worried that children wouldn’t learn about patience, discipline, dignity, self-reliance and generosity if they didn’t kill deer. Hunting isn’t really about guns or even antlers on a wall, he fantasized, it’s about teaching kids self-worth.He was also worried that kids who hunt are told that it’s “cruel and unnecessary.”That’s because it is.
