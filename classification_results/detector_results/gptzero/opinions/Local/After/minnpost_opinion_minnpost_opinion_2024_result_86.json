For every 100,000 workers in food preparation and service, 118 died from overdose. Among every 100,000 personal care and service providers, such as childcare and home health workers, overdoses killed 74 of them. Simultaneously, the lowest rates of overdose death by occupations are found in the business and financial sector (11), computer and mathematics (9), and education, training and library positions (6). The combined death by overdose rate for the highest three groups is more than 13 times greater than for workers in the three lowest groups. This stark disparity requires explanation.While it might be tempting to attribute the difference in overdose rates to intelligence, that’s a convenient fiction. Even in stable economic times, occupations with the highest rates of overdose deaths are among the most physically demanding. Construction and healthcare workers spend long hours on their feet, climbing, bending and carrying tools, materials or even people. These physical demands create dangerous conditions; workplace accidents and injuries are far more common with roofers, for example, than they are with librarians. If education does provide a protective factor, it is because education provides access to occupations that are inherently less dangerous.There’s also a higher degree of employment uncertainty with construction, restaurant and personal care workers. Economic downturns hit the construction industry hard. Construction is weather dependent; many workers are pushed, or push themselves, to take advantage when the weather cooperates. When the economy is shaky, eating out becomes a luxury many eliminate.Restaurant closures soaredduring the pandemic and most likely will not return to pre-pandemic levels. Finally, personal healthcare workers during the pandemic often had to do more with less.Their turnover rate— those who left or whose employment was terminated — soared to 77%.One of the biggest protections against overdosing is having affordable health insurance. Many employers don’t offer insurance, putting the onus on workers to buy their own healthcare plan or find a job — often an additional one — that does provide coverage. Even then, plans with high deductibles and copays preclude many from using their insurance for anything other than something catastrophic. Moreover, people need workday flexibility to go to appointments. If someone worries she’ll be fired or lose shifts, she’s less likely to seek medical care and may try to alleviate her pain by self-medicating with drugs she gets from family, friends or dealers. Fentanyl is commonly mixed with recreational drugs along withXylazine, a veterinary non-opiate sedative, analgesic and muscle relaxant. In these instances, pain relief may come at the expense of one’s life.The overdose epidemic is not the canary in the coal mine; it’s the mine collapsing. The misleading part of “deaths of despair” is that despair is a consequence of marginalization, powerlessness and exploitation. When people are marginalized in the economic, social and political realms, they are relegated to the sidelines, their voices ignored or silenced. Marginalization leads to powerlessness, a loss of control over major life decisions such as occupations, marital status and living arrangements. These people become more susceptible to the vicious cycle of economic exploitation: long hours, low pay, dangerous working conditions and fragile job security.By addressing these dynamics of despair — marginalization, powerlessness and exploitation — we begin to create a real possibility of effectively reducing the number of people whose tragic, premature deaths are ultimately avoidable and preventable.Peg O’Connor is a professor of philosophy at Gustavus Adolphus College, a recovering alcoholic and the author of “Life on the Rocks: Finding Meaning in Addiction and Recovery” and “Higher and Friendly Powers: Transforming Addiction and Suffering.”"
