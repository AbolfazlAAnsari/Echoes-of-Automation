Because AR-15s also have a 16-inch barrel, they are also excluded from the definition of “firearms.”Butthe AR-15 is not a hunting rifle. The bullets move so fast and in such quick succession that they tear up deer and other game, making it impossible to eat. But the Pennsylvania legislature has done nothing to reclassify this gun despite its popularity —one in 20 adults in America now owns one.The AR-15 is not a hunting rifle.There are a couple of caveats, which should give readers small comfort. Semiautomatic rifles are defined as “firearms” under thestatute used to prosecute felonswho are found carrying guns. And, in Philadelphia,it is a misdemeanor to possess any gun, including any kind of rifle, without a license. But Philadelphia only accounts for 12% of the state’s population.It would be nice to think this loophole’s continued existence is merely an oversight. But that might be naive.Republicans, who have controlled the Pennsylvania legislature for decades,often rely on the National Rifle Association to fund their campaigns, making any increase in gun regulation a nonstarter. U.S. Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) recently told the Washington Post that he believes protecting the AR-15 is “the number one priority of the gun lobby.” Some Republican lawmakers have taken to wearing miniAR-15s as lapel pins. In many ways, the AR-15 has become a powerful political symbol associated with the Republican Party, acultural touchstoneamong gun enthusiasts.Pennsylvania Republicans are all too happy to police handguns in Philadelphia, but they are not so eager when it comes tothe guns most commonly seen in rural, white communities.The attempted assassination of former President Trump presents an opportunity to address this indefensible hole in our gun laws. Let’s urge Pennsylvania lawmakers to revisit this strange exclusion, and stop ignoring these weapons. And if Republicans block these efforts, let’s make sure they pay for it at the ballot box in November.Dana Bazelon is the former policy director for Philadelphia District AttorneyLarry Krasner."
