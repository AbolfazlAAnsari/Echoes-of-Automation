Born and raised here, I have spent my life observing, listening to, and writing about all things Snowmass. And, it’s not hyperbolic; my genuine wish for Snowmass Village is, and always has been, that we remain aggressively aware of our priceless natural connections, of our unique character, and that we respect the magnitude of our human impact on this valley. And, that we do it together.\nIf you have read stories preserved inThe Story of Snowmass(Our history book that I helped to co-create) or any of the years of columns I have penned in theSnowmass Sun, then you may have some idea of where I stand on many Snowmass Village issues. My beliefs and values have held fast. If it’s worth saying, it has probably been said.\nAnd, in my own written words over the past seven years, I submit from theSnowmass Sun:\n“In the midst of change, these grand vistas hold fast: Mt Daly, shrouded in mist on a bluebird day or backlit by an intense gradient of hot pink and burgundy hues, the early morning blue-gray shadows sculpting the landscape across a crystalline carpet of fresh white snow, and the unparalleled panorama of peaks that swaddle our valley.\nSo many of us live for that beauty.”\nThink big, stay small\nFeb. 17, 2021\n*****\n“For many of us, our immediate natural connections are the very reason to forge ahead and work way too much. That work-life imbalance has always been offset here by wide-open spaces and exceptional recreation opportunities.”\nTectonic shifts\nMay 2020\n*****\n“For me, the questions remain: Are we staying in concert with our original vision, our own mission statement? Cautiously eyeing our roots as we look forward, I hope we will remain aware of the scale and character of our small village.”\nBack and forth\nDec. 19, 2018\n*****\n“We ought to continue fostering an authentic small-town atmosphere of boutique businesses and local restaurants rather than adding more glamorous offerings for an indulgent luxury lifestyle.”\nTourism’s footprints\nMarch 16, 2022\n****\n“Aspen was born in the age of mining, while Snowmass Village has the raw roots of a ranching community.”\nRodeo our timeless western tradition\nJune 23, 2021\n*****\n“History, coupled with innovation, determines the new paths on which we will someday find ourselves.”\nIt’s OK to reinvent the wheel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Our Dynamic Team at Lassiter Electric, TODAY!
