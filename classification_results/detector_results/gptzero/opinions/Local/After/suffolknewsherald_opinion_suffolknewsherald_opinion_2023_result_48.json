Tensions between the United States and Soviet Union increased steadily through the end of the ’50s and into the beginning of the ’60s. Cuba was a main pawn in the tense power struggle. It was pointed out as a Soviet base. In October 1960, the United States banned all exports to Cuba except certain medical supplies and foods. In preparation for potential war, both the United States and Soviets began long-range rocket tests. Other technology in weapons and surveillance was tested constantly.Another aspect of the Cold War was the space race.

It whipped around the world, paving the way for a space-age communications system for U.S military forces.The developments in technology weren’t limited to space travel — developments in computers were underway.Machines capable of learning are on the way, an Army study project said. “The goal, of course, is to make the computer behave more like the human planner,” Julius Brick said. “This is the direction in which computer designers will be heading for some time.”In 1959, Hawaii became the 50th state. On July 4, 1960, the 50-star flag became official. A large-scale marketing campaign was launched in Suffolk’s downtown area to convince merchants and residents to buy and display new flags for the July 4 holiday.At the end of 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected president.Suffolkians have always co-existed with native animals, it would seem. In this case, it was a pole-sitting raccoon. “A raccoon atop a telephone pole had folks downtown in a tizzy this morning until Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co. linemen came to the rescue,” the newspaper reported. “How and why the animal got to the top of the pole in front of Brady’s Radio and TV shop on North Saratoga was not known, but he was found there by early risers this morning.“Mister Raccoon came down with a plop, when first knocked from his perch by the telephone company lineman, but promptly scrambled back to it before he could be caught. But the second time he came down, Army recruiter Sgt. Vera Fowler appeared with a cardboard box, and the night visitor was carted off to the country to climb trees rather than telephone poles.”Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59) on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.
