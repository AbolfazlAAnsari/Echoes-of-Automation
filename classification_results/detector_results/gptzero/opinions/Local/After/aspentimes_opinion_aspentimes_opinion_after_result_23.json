Is it true though?\nSadly, here in the United States, COVID-19 has become just another divisive issue among political parties. And, while people may dispute the veracity and intent of our country’s leading medical scientists, the fact of the matter is new variants of COVID-19 are killing people. This is not “false information” nor is it politically biased.\nInfection rates are increasing, and people are dying. The delta variant, which was first identified in India in December, is in96 countriesand spreading at a faster clip than all other variants. It is the dominant variant worldwide and here in the United States, it is responsible for more than70% of cases. According to the American Medical Association’s liaison to the Centers for Disease Control, Sandra Fryhofer, MD, the delta variant “is hyper transmissible, a full vaccination series seems to protect against it, but you need both doses of a two-dose series — one mRNA vaccine dose may not be enough.”\nAs of July 13, CDC data indicates that Missouri and Nevada are the hardest hit with new cases of the delta variant, 74.6% and 44.1% respectively. Here in Colorado, the delta variant accounts for 36.5% of all COVID-19 cases.\nI recently read an article from Johns Hopkins that was quite distressing. Jennifer B. Nuzzo, DrPH, lead epidemiologist for the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Testing Insights Initiative and Associate Professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health stated: “There’s fairly clear evidence that the delta variant spreads faster. So, when people get infected, they’re capable of infecting more people and we accumulate more cases in a given period of time with delta. That’s concerning, because it means that some places that have been really good at controlling the spread of COVID through traditional public health tools, like testing and isolation and contact tracing, are having a harder time keeping up with the spread of the virus.”\nAs tourists from around the globe took refuge in many of our mountain communities this past year, we did a pretty good job of mitigating the spread and horrific consequences of COVID-19. Outside of those first few months when many mountain communities were locked down and again around the holiday break, much of the past 18 months afforded people to live pretty normal lives. For those that chose, many of our outdoors activities were available, restaurants and grocery stores were open, and access to medical needs were met. Such luxuries may soon be lost and our freedoms may once again be pulled back.\nAs of July 23, theCDC reportshows the current seven-day moving average of daily new cases (40,246) increased 46.7% compared with the previous seven-day moving average (27,443).\nAcross the U.S., the recent surge of COVID-19 deaths have almost entirely been among those who were unvaccinated. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky recently stated, “Ninety-seven percent of people who get so sick with COVID-19 that they have to be hospitalized are unvaccinated.”\nIn Louisiana, the State’s Health Officer, Dr. Jo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Description: Primary Responsibility Supervisory/Management Manage the Department of Strategic Initiatives, which includes various externally funded program...\nHOA Accountant Full-Time Position Salary: 75k-90K Benefits include Medical/Dental/Vision, PTO, 401k, annual bonuses, and others Frias Properties of Aspen Sn...\nWE ARE HIRING!
