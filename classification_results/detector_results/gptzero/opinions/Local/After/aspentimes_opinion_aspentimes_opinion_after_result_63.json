As we rebuild in the wake of the pandemic, we need to ensure an equitable recovery for all, and that means investing in the communities that have been hit hardest.\nThanks to funding from the American Rescue Plan Act, we now have an opportunity to truly build back better for all Coloradans. That’s why our organizations have joined the Asian Pacific Development Center, the Latino Community Foundation of Colorado, and The Hispanic Affairs Project to create the Communities Lead, Communities Thrive Coalition.\nOur coalition is made up of smaller Colorado nonprofits serving Black, Indigenous, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islanders, LGBTQ+, and rural communities who have come together to ensure that our organizations and the communities we serve are not left behind as we work to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nThe coalition is working to pass House Bill 22-1356, sponsored by Representatives Edie Hooton and Leslie Herod and Senators Julie Gonzales and Bob Rankin. This bipartisan bill will make a critical investment of Rescue Plan funds in the small community-based nonprofits that have been critical lifelines throughout the pandemic for marginalized communities.\nThroughout the pandemic, many nonprofits had to abruptly shift focus and resources to support their communities. After-school recreation programs began providing neighborhood meals. Mental-health organizations began providing housing assistance. Advocacy groups began providing direct assistance grants to families. In unexpected ways, nonprofits across the state have stepped up to serve their neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was devastating for the countless Coloradans who lost their eased overall economic instability. Lower-income LGBTQ+ individuals in Colorado reported the greatest needs for mental health, medical and unemployment benefit services during the pandemic, and LGBTQ+ and communities of color reported the greatest needs for financial assistance.\nThese families are still in need of support and services, which they often receive through small nonprofits. As trusted local voices, these nonprofits uniquely understand their community’s specific needs and how to effectively disperse resources and services. HB-1356 will help ensure we are reaching these communities that often fall through the cracks by directly providing resources to the nonprofits already doing this work.\nInvesting in nonprofits also is a boon to Colorado’s economy. Our state’s nonprofit sector employs more Coloradans than the agriculture, mining, and information industries combined, and the nonprofit sector’s direct spending is $20 billion with an overall economic impact of $40 billion. In fact, for every $1 million spent, nonprofits create 10 . AP, AR, payroll prep, bank and CC records. Excellent communication…\nJoin Our Dynamic Team at Lassiter Electric, TODAY!
