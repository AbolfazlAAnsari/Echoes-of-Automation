Those words now echo loudly, as pundits recall them in the wake of Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election.Like Biden, Johnson was a sitting Democratic president who was eligible for another term. Both men understood the odds against reelection, and both opted out. Their decisions shape their legacies as presidents who compiled impressive records yet failed to sustain their power across a longer span.As the author of “The Men and the Moment,” a short narrative history of the presidential election of 1968, I have reflected on these parallels, too. But I think we can learn more from the differences in the circumstances of Biden’s and Johnson’s withdrawals. They illustrate the high hurdles that thepresumed Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, now must clear, while also sounding a note of hope for the Democratic Party.One important distinction between Johnson and Biden was the nature and timing of their decisions.Johnson arrived at his decision not to run for a second full term on his own, five months before the Democratic National Convention.

Kennedy.Biden, by contrast, renounced his nomination well after the primaries and just one month before the convention. Moreover, he succumbed to external pressure from donors and party leaders to leave the race, stemming fromhis disastrous performance in the June 27, 2024, debate.Biden’s prolonged candidacy appears to have dictated that the party anoint Harris as his successor. Can she craft a message that resonates with voters? Can she win their trust and respect?Running in the primaries would have provided answers. Instead, for now, those questions linger.Another divergence between 1968 and 2024 was the process of delegate selection.In 1968, only a handful of states had binding primaries, where all delegates pledged their vote to the election’s winner. It wasmore common for party insiders to choose delegatesthroughstate conventions and other bureaucratic means.Humphrey campaigned through the spring and summer of 1968, but he avoided primary elections. McCarthy and Kennedy battled in those primaries, each trying to claim the mantle of the popular anti-war challenger. ThenKennedy was assassinatedin June, and McCarthy failed to rally a viable coalition. Humphrey captured the nomination by winning the support of most Democratic officials.By the next election cycle, the party had enacted reforms for choosing delegates,including open primaries and caucuses. That system remains in place now.Yet this year’s extraordinary turn of events means that Harris has bypassed that system. Unlike Humphrey, she has to overcome voters’ doubts about whether she is the genuine preferred candidate of the Democratic Party.If these distinctions from 1968 illustrate the obstacles before Harris, a final difference suggests one of her greatest assets: She has the support ofalmost the entire Democratic Party,including the sitting president.Humphrey could not say the same. His own president kept hanging him out to dry.To attract voters seeking change, Humphrey needed to articulate his own position on the Vietnam War, but Johnson was unwilling to make concessions as a prelude to peace.He bullied Humphreyinto supporting his tough stance, which included a reluctance to halt bombings in North Vietnam.Johnson didn’t respect Humphrey. Early in the race,LBJ privately beseeched Republican Nelson Rockefeller to run. By the general election, Johnson seemed more politically aligned withRepublican nominee Richard Nixonthan with his own vice president.Vietnam was cleaving the party, and Humphrey could not heal the wounds. Finally, at the very end of September, Humphrey cast his independent stance on the war, pledging to halt the bombing of North Vietnam“as an acceptable risk for peace.”But it was too little, too late.McCarthy, his fellow Minnesotan, offeredthe limpest of endorsements, and not until one week before Election Day. In the end, Humphrey could not unite Democratic voters, and Nixon triumphed.Now, for all the ideological differences among prominent Democrats, the party looks unified in its ambition to negate the threat they see in Donald Trump. Biden will almost certainly exhibit more political generosity than Johnson.In addressing the monumental task of a late presidential run against the polarizing figure of Trump, Harris faces challenges that are unique in American political history. If she can overcome them, she might avoid the fate of Humphrey.Aram Goudsouzianis theBizot Family Professor of History at the University of Memphis.This article is republished from The Conversation."
