We determined that we needed to stay nimble to continue to serve our community, so we created an entirely new website with online shopping at the ReStore and introduced new building efficiencies at Basalt Vista.\n\n\nAs a result, sales and donations at the Restore are strong and our homes for hardworking local families at Basalt Vista are being completed on schedule. We also sent generously donated items throughout the state to families who were economically impacted or devastated by the fires last summer.\nWe are very optimistic about the future and again thank the citizens of the Roaring Fork and Colorado River valleys for the strength you have shown in the face of our collective challenges.\n\n\n\nYet there is another significant challenge that faces our communities that cannot be overcome with vaccines or face masks: That is our affordable housing crisis.\nHabitat for Humanity is committed along with many generous partners to address this challenge to local working families and this threat to the very fabric of our communities. As we work every day to build affordable homes, we are helping to stabilize the neighbors we all depend upon to teach our children, provide our health care, keep our communities safe and our main streets successful, now and into the future. Habitat can not meet this challenge — and fill the large and growing gap of thousands of affordable units needed to stabilize our workforce — alone.\nIt takes many hands to build homes, and we are genuinely grateful to partner with volunteers, donors, local governments and businesses to get this job done for working families! But we need local jurisdictions to provide proactive housing and land use policies, fee concessions and land donations that make affordable housing development feasible in our valleys.\nBuilding on Habitat’s ethos of providing “a hand up, not a handout,” Habitat sincerely values and appreciates communal support and advocacy in our mutual endeavors to build affordable housing to ensure that we remain a healthy, prosperous, welcoming and inclusive community for many years to come.\nGail Schwartz is the president of Habitat for Humanity Roaring Fork Valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Description: Primary Responsibility Supervisory/Management Manage the Department of Strategic Initiatives, which includes various externally funded program...\nHOA Accountant Full-Time Position Salary: 75k-90K Benefits include Medical/Dental/Vision, PTO, 401k, annual bonuses, and others Frias Properties of Aspen Sn...\nWE ARE HIRING!
