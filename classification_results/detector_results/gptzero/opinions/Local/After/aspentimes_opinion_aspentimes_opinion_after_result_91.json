Aspen’s focus on mind, body and spirit permeated the schools which stressed a whole-child educational philosophy. In addition to academic excellence, programs like Outdoor Ed instilled an appreciation for our environment and an independent spirit.\nThat’s how Aspen School District became one of the best rated districts in the state AND country, attracting families who trusted our schools to not only educate their children, but lift them to their highest potential. Unfortunately, the Aspen school’s reputation and rankings have slipped dramatically in the last few years. With all our schools having suffered serious setbacks, I’m motivated to help ASD re-summit the peak.\nWhen my eldest entered kindergarten, I dove, heart and soul, into school-related volunteerism.  For over a decade, I’ve been a teacher-helper in the classroom, served on both district and school accountability committees and become a confidant to many educators and parents.\nWhen it became apparent that our previous district leadership was failing our teachers and students, I led the effort to expose our declining academics and deteriorating culture and climate, resulting in a difficult but necessary change. I then served on search committees that hired our outstanding new Superintendent and principals.\nWith new district-wide leadership in place – and my youngest out of diapers – I’m eager to bring my experience and consensus-building skills to the Board of Education. My highest priority is to address both opportunity and achievement gaps as well as pandemic learning and social-emotional losses, both of which hit vulnerable students hardest.\nAccording to recent testing, over half of our current 5th and 6th graders don’t read on grade level, and seven out of 10 have fallen behind in math. Considering other distressing trends in our school, including social/emotional regression, it has frustrated me that these concerns have barely been discussed in this campaign. These aren’t just statistics; they are our kids!\nConsidering these imperatives – as well as the need to ensure affordable housing to attract and retain teachers – I was disappointed that the Aspen Education Association asked in its candidate questionnaire questions on national partisan issues like vouchers and school choice.  These national issues are irrelevant in our district and an example of how union priorities can conflict with parents’ concerns and teachers’ actual interests, often eroding community trust and good will.\nNot surprisingly, I wasn’t endorsed by our local union, but I do have the support of many current and former teachers of all political stripes who have worked with me directly and are thankful for my years of service. I was thrilled to see Superintendent David B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging Director White Elephant Aspen White Elephant Resorts is now accepting applications for the position of Managing Director of White…\nSeeking FT Operations Manager for high end homecare division of Hansen Construction.
