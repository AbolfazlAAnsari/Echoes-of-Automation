Sure, it rains a lot. Sometimes people complain and vent. There’s pilikia.But, most of what I experience on a daily basis is people from all over the island sharing smiles, helpful hands, kind words, good deeds, hearts of aloha and. of course, ono grinds!Mahalo, Akua, for the privilege to live in this beautiful land. Mahalo nui, Big Island kanaka, for your open hearts of aloha. You are appreciated beyond words.Laurie ConnableHiloMaking the case for ‘third candidate’My name is Jay Failing. I have lived on the Big Island since 1989. I own land here and have an orchard. I am no one special.The thing which will be remembered about me is I worked hard, and with skill.I love the Big Island and hate to go away. I love and respect many people here.I am about as far from politics as one can be. I view them as a necessary evil. Like money.I am in my 70s and starting to think about retiring, if that is even possible, and dying. So, I speak straight from my heart and mind. I do not want anything like money or a position. Even agreement.However, in these trying times, and with an election coming up, I have a dilemma: Not real excited about either of the two main offerings. Both have positive attributes and negative aspects, which we will not delve into. They are well-known. Just the fact I am not excited about either. I am not alone.But one thing for sure, I grew up in an amazing period of history and have paid careful attention. I am sure I am not alone in being disturbed by the present events and apparent decline, unraveling of harmony and order, and sickness of our overall health and strength as a people.Violence, drugs crime, fear, hunger, homelessness, immense national debt — the list is long. We have come too far to let the blood, sweat and tears paid by those before us be wasted. Thus, we look for strong leaders to help us exit this quagmire.I stumbled on a short video about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. We remember his father, who was assassinated, and his uncle, John F. Kennedy, also assassinated. As a young teen, I was inspired by JFK, in particular his physical fitness program, which whipped us chubby teens into shape.He had his downside, like anyone, but was inspiring to many of us, and it crushed me to lose him.You are quietly trying to figure: Is this guy, Jay, a Dem or a Republican, right? I am not. I am an Independent.Like many. I drift right in some ways, like being free, left in others, like taking care of our kids and elderly, veterans, education.I stumbled onto someone who rings a bell, in my distrustful and alienated world, so I am hoping you can maybe view this short video to learn about the “third candidate.” Our world is controlled by media, who can distort and manipulate our perception of persons not favored by the powers that be.I have arrived at the fact he is smart, has heart, physically strong and loves his nation. I have differences with some of his stances, for sure. I will vote for him.If you have an open or curious mind, watch the video: “The Robert F. Kennedy Movie” narrated by Woody Harrelson. Then you may understand this man, sans all the lies and character defamation.A close friend I look up to commented, “We had 12 years of Republican rule and 12 years of Democratic rule, and I don’t like where our nation is at. My wife and I are voting for RFK.”I am willing to give this man a try. You will, or already have, come to your own conclusions. May the best person win for the sake of our nation.At least hear him out.Jay C. FailingPuako"
