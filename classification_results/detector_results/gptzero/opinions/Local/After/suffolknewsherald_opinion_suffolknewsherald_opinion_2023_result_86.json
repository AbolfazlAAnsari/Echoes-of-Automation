Several attempts were made to allow the state to take over operation of Chesapeake Ferry Company, which ran the ferries between Newport News and Pine Beach and Old Point Comfort and Willoughby Spit. One story about the proposed state running of the ferries claimed them to “constitute a vital part in the integration of our highway system.”One of the main items declared as reason for the strikes was pay.

The reports from these trials exposed the horrific extent of their inhuman treatment of Jews and prisoners.One such example was published on March 20, 1946, titled “German confesses Nazis killed 2 million Jews.” The story details one of the most prominent war trials held. “The gassing of 2,000,000 Jews and other persons at the Oswiecim horror camp was admitted in a signed statement given to British authorities by Rudolf Hoss, 46-year-old commandant of the camp, who was arrested on March 8.
