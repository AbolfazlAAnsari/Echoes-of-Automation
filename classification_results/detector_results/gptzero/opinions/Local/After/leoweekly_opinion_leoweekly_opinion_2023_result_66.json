I was challenged to see how advertising could damage society. The example before me was the creation of Joe Camel for Camel cigarettes. This cute cartoon character was focused on hooking them young. The cigarette industry knew they had an addictive product, and could benefit from a twelve-year-old getting hooked for life. To be involved in this industry was out of the question at this point.I changed my major to social work and moved to Louisville. My father had passed away, and I was on my own financially. I worked in mental health while in school and learned from the streets alongside the books.The real-world work experience from inpatient psychiatric and street social work was the best education I could receive. I was full of passion by the time I talked my way into a position at the Home of the Innocents in their Pregnant and Parenting Teens program. I received my first salary of $19,000 per year — a joke, but one I was happy to accept. I was in my early twenties, helping to grow a program with young homeless families not much younger than myself.I completed my bachelor’s and master’s degrees with this job, and I hit my goal of making at least $30,000 a year by the time I was 30. My pride in my accomplishment of being a part of something that truly helped stop homelessness in young families fed my grieving and lost soul.The time came to pay back my loans and hopefully thrive in my career, but the world of social work was shifting from a street-based model with qualitative data to one that was backed by big medical dollars that needed quantifiable outcomes to flourish. I found myself begging for funds to keep programs going and to maintain salaries for the staff.The work got harder, and the children and families we served got more and more difficult to handle. The salaries did not improve over time, and I found myself having to jump through more and more hoops to maintain my own healthcare and living expenses alongside my clients.My company hosted a dinner that cost $100 a person. I couldn’t afford to attend.Seeing others’ trauma and personal struggles for 30 years will affect you no matter how strong and educated you think you are. Now, I find myself disabled, having had to retire early from my chosen career. The sicker I got, the less I could afford the copays for prescriptions I needed, and the residual student loan payments took any monetary benefit I had from having an education and career.As I look at my student loans today, they are stagnant — the same $42,000 that I originally borrowed. It doesn’t add up that the $60,000 I’ve already paid is not enough.That being said, I own my ignorance about how these predatory loans worked.I’m also dismayed by the fact that I had to be found disabled to afford the meds I needed for feeling healthy, finally.As a nation, we are richer than we have ever been, and farther from true humanity. Yet, I stay here with my little fire still burning with hope.*** ."
