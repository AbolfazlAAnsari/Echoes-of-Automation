Families shared both tears and smiles as they held their candles close to their hearts. When Mark Yamanaka’s voice and acoustic guitar filled up the space with a heart-moving singing of “Oh Holy Night,” every individual in the room was reminded that this season, no matter how difficult, can be filled with light.Holidays may be the merriest time of the year for many, but for some, it can be a season of longing and grief — especially if their loved ones are no longer with them. Hawaii Care Choices, formerly Hospice of Hilo, organized the “Season of Light” event for the community on Dec. 13 at Wailoa State Park from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m., to ensure that both individuals and families going through bereavement were provided with a space of healing and hope during this time of the year.This Candlelight Tribute ceremony was a free public event, open to all East Hawaii community members. Attendees were encouraged to bring a photo of their loved ones, but everything else — candles, chairs, cookies, beverages and even a special memorial keepsake box filled with items to help create a personal altar — was provided.The evening’s program began with music by Yamanaka, a 14-time Na Hoku Hanohano award winner and Hilo’s beloved musician. Highlights of the program included: Reflections of Christmases past by Madeline Brooks as she shared about how her deceased, beloved husband who was the Santa at Prince Kuhio Plaza for over 17 years, brought joy and hope for countless children in Hilo.A story of Christmas present was shared by Hawaii Care Choices spiritual counselor, Catherine Czerepak. Bereavement counselor Rev. Jihey Roach shared about the hope and prayer of Christmas future. Lastly, after multifaith blessings, Kahu Brian Welsh lead the group into the candlelight tribute. As each candle began to glow row by row, sadness soon transformed into gratitude and comfort. Together, the small tea light candles brought a bigger wave of light, representing the strength and inspiration that we can also bring for one another.Christina Robledo from Community First Hawaii shared, “It was so touching to hear stories, words of encouragement, and poetry from the speakers involved. I went in memorial of my late grandma, and it was emotional and comforting for me to be with others who are and have been feeling the same as I have. I hope to see this event grow because what it offers is so comforting for a community where one loss is felt by so many.
