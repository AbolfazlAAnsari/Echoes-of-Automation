Instead, the NCAA, which had long fought Title IX’s application in athletics, changed course and set its sights on taking control of women’s sports.The NCAA offered women’s championships in all three divisions for the first time during the 1981-82 school year. Leveraging all of its presumed legitimacy and financial resources, the 75-year-old men’s athletic organizationoffered all-expenses-paid women’s championships on the same weekends as the unpaid AIAW championships.The strategy worked. The AIAW lost significant members and ceased operations in mid-1982, despite the fact that women athletes, coaches and administratorspreferred its educational model and leadership structure.The NCAA made vague promises to support women’s athletics but refused to give women more than token representation on its governance boards. Women student-athletes were, for the first time, led by a male-dominated governance organization.To this day,institutional sexism remains entrenched in the NCAA.Women hold only41.3% of head coaching positions for women’s teams and 23.9% of athletic director positions– roles that were largely held by women under the AIAW. A recent gender equity review found that the organizationunder-resourced nearly all of its women’s championships, a result ofgender bias and its focus on making money.The NCAA and its corporate partners would like you to believe that their organization is the be-all and end-all of college sports.But the story of the AIAW – created by and for women, rejecting the crass commercialism of the NCAA and empowering student-athletes to speak up – offers ideas for a more equitable future for college sports.Diane Williamsis an assistant professor of Kinesiology at McDaniel College.This article is republished from The Conversation."
