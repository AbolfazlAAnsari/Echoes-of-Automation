From the start of the war, women and men excused from the front lines have banded together to feed people in urban bomb shelters, rescue elderly Ukrainians from villages under fire, provide generators for those without heat and electricity, and help the internally displaced and wounded.The courage of ordinary people who risk their lives to help their countrymen is extraordinary and continues as the war nears the second-year mark. It reflects their determination not to fall under Russia’s despotic rule (and shreds the argument of those who claim Ukrainians fight only at NATO’s bidding).That is why, when it comes to Ukraine, I prefer to recommend smaller Ukrainian organizations, founded by Ukrainians (or Ukrainian Americans) whose work I have seen in person.As I did last Christmas, I particularly recommend Ukraine TrustChain (ukrainetrustchain.org), whose teams deliver aid directly to where it is most needed, and whose terrific work I have witnessed in my reporting.Ukraine TrustChain was founded at the start of the war by two Ukrainian American childhood friends who had emigrated from Kyiv to Chicago and Philadelphia, respectively, when they were 10 years old. Their concept was to find team leaders among people they or their friends trusted in Ukraine, and have those volunteers build regional networks of people they trusted in turn. The money raised goes directly to the teams, with constant contact and periodic visits from board members in the U.S.In July, I traveled with a team of volunteers from the southern port of Odesa as they drove four hours in their own cars to the recently liberated city of Kherson, on the Dnieper River. The city is still under daily shelling from Russian troops on the opposite bank — we heard regular booms, sometimes close by. Parts of Kherson had been heavily flooded when the Russians blew up the Kakhovka Dam upriver to impede the movement of Ukrainian troops.Led by Alena Prizhebolska, a real estate agent before the war, the group dropped off some equipment to two local deminers trying to clear the area around a bus stop and a walking path. The group also unloaded sacks of vegetables to volunteer cooks at a shelter who were feeding locals whose houses had been destroyed by the flood.Then we drove to a dangerous area along the river, from which you could almost see Russian positions, where local volunteers were helping residents dig out the claylike muck that had poured into their houses when the flood waters hit.“Right after the flood, we bought a boat and evacuated survivors from the left bank,” Prizhebolska told me, as local homeowners rushed out to greet her. “Now, to save houses, Ukraine Trust Chain bought pumps to pump out water.”In the Kherson area, other Ukraine TrustChain teams are providing seeds, seedlings, and tools to thousands of small farmers in de-occupied areas who lost everything under Russian control.What is so amazing — and moving — is that this volunteer spirit has continued for nearly two years. Other teams bring food to villages on the front lines and evacuate those who seek to leave, while delivering firewood so that residents whose power lines have been bombed can survive the winter. And these actions do not come without risk for the volunteers. In November, one volunteer truck in Eastern Ukraine was nearly hit by a Russian drone.Meantime, the number of Ukraine’s military war wounded has mounted. For those who want to help, I again recommend Revived Soldiers of Ukraine (rsukraine.org) which aids wounded soldiers at home and brings some to the U.S. to be fitted for prosthetics.
