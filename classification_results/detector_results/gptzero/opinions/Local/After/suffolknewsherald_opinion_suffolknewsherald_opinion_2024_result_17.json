Can you help me and my wife find our way back to each other?Congratulations on reaching the milestone of raising your children to reach adulthood. That accomplishment should be celebrated, and you both should be very proud. I also congratulate you on holding your marriage together while raising children. Research shows that marriage is a major life event and so is parenthood. Embarking on both can create a major onset of stress, even if it is good stress. This can often make individuals feel like they are barely making it through life and unable to give 100% to either the marriage or the children. However, as most will agree, you do the best that you can with love, effort, and I believe you must learn to be the best spouse and parent that you can be. The fact that you are asking me how to help you and your wife find your way back to one another tells me you are ready to let your children be adults. I also congratulate you on this, as some parents are afraid to let go of their children for fear that they will not be needed anymore, and some are unable to face the quiet that is present when children aren’t around. However, you seem to be ready to embark on a new journey so here are my thoughts. Some would call what you are going through: the Empty Nest Syndrome or the Empty Nest Stage.
