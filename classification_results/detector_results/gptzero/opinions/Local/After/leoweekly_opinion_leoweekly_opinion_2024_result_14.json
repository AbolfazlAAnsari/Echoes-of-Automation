Their names are:Henry Smith, age 18Samuel Hammond, age 18Delano Middleton, age 18Soldiers are cutting us downThis isn’t hyperbole; these aresoldierscutting down college kids. It was the National Guard in Ohio a half century ago. If it’s not the Guard today, it's quasi-military organizations within local and state law enforcement units, made heavy beyond reason withsurplus gear from the Pentagon. Most of these state cops have no formal military training, but all the gusto of a GI dropped into a war zone and trained on an indigenous enemy. 40 officers firedhundreds of roundsin Jackson. There were tanks on the ground at Orangeburg. Now they’ve gotbatons in the chestsof twentysomethings andsnipers on the rooftopsat theCrossroads of America.Should have been done long agoSo far as I can tell, there have been no killings of protesters on an American college campus since Jackson. One might be led to believe that police have gotten better about responding to peaceful protests. It may be more accurate to say that campuses, with the help of courts, legislatures, and other power structures, have gotten better at suppressing them. It may also be accurate to say that the latter half of the twentieth century taught students, and the working class in general, to stay in their places. If you think there's a better-than-average chance you'll get shot at school for protesting a foreign war, you might stay home. Your mom might beg you not to go. Even your professors might encourage you to forcrissakeshutup.On second thought, maybe authoritariansdolearn from history.What if you knew herAnd found her dead on the groundAs we see more protests, we will see more state violence. Soldiers are still willing to build pressure cookers around protesters and shoot them when the boiling starts. At least two people were killed by brute squads during Breonna Taylor Summer. Their names were:David McAtee, age 53Sean Monterrosa, age 22The fact that death hasn’t happened recently on a university campus is a happy accident, but it is inevitable if militarized response to protests continues. That’s what the soldiers are there for.How can you run when you know?*** ."
