Both terrestrial (biomes) and aquatic ecosystems have become more accessible and are under unprecedented assault enabled by pervasive technology.What many companies don’t seem perturbed about is the finiteness of the environment and its relationship with the economy. It’s imperative to note that the economy is, believe it or not, a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment. The environment is the proverbial hand that feeds the economy that we must not bite. Metaphorically, the environment is the driver and the economy is the driven or the passenger in this relationship.This corporate lack of restraint and recklessness, vis-à-vis the environment, is a primary cause of environmental degradation. On the one hand, natural resource depletion and industrial production represent action emanating from the ecosystem to the economy, which builds up economic stocks. On the other hand, environmental pollution and asset depreciation emanate from the economy to the ecosystems, which reduce economic stocks. Even though the ecosystems and the economy provide useful services for society, the effects on the environment and consequences are unsustainable, knowing as we do now, that the environment is the proverbial hand that feeds the economy.The late renowned economist Herman Edward Daly likened environmental degradation to a disease induced by neoclassical economists who see growth as interchangeable with economic, social, and political development. It is not! Be that as it may, these economists attempt to treat this sickness with unlimited wants by prescribing unlimited production. This is akin to attempting to cure a disease from treatment by increasing the treatment dosage. This behavior does not reflect a good understanding of the relationship between the environment and the economy.Regardless of the level of a country’s development, both the economy and society are tied to the environment. Our ecological and carbon footprints are taking their toll and causing unprecedented change in the global climate. Some have argued that climate change is cyclical and no different now than it was in the past. However, the intensity and severity of natural disasters are sufficient evidence to show that what is happening now has gone beyond cyclical climate change to involve climate change intensified by our technology-enabled ecological and carbon footprints or anthropogenic (human-driven) activities. According, NASA, January 2024 was the warmest month on record, breaking the record set in 2016.Stronger and more destructive natural disasters, rising carbon dioxide levels, warming oceans, thawing permafrost, lakes freezing up later, winter losing its bite, spring arriving earlier, habitat change, lingering droughts, declining snowpacks, eroding coastlines, bleaching coral reefs, invading exotic species, plants flowering sooner, rising sea levels, melting glaciers — these are the effects of climate change that National Geographic described long ago as signs from earth.Anthony Akubue is a resident of St. Cloud, Minnesota."
