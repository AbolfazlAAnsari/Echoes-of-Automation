The life cycle can be summed up as follows: Eat. Sleep. Wake up. Go to work. Rinse and repeat. In between and even before and after each, we indulge in a misplaced and misguided pursuit of happiness.The part that breaks my heart in all of this is that we know what we are doing, but we just can’t seem to wake up from this nightmare. We know that we are sacrificing the most precious commodities we have — our health and time — for a dopamine release whose effect is temporary. We scroll through our phones nonstop, watching shows that mean absolutely nothing, listening to songs that are absolutely rubbish, and reading gossip so that we have something to talk about and laugh at with friends. What a sad existence.The fact is, it is not like we don’t have ambitions and dreams that we want to have come to fruition. We all have dreams, but they are just thoughts as long as we lack the loaded gun we need to fire. Discipline. I am guilty as charged, too. We want to become writers, entrepreneurs, designers, lawyers, travelers, motivational speakers, professional players, etc. The list never ends. We will never be able to check off any of these as long as we are indulging ourselves in what the body and mind want — an easy life. We don’t want to put in the work for the things we want to achieve and later wonder what happened to the time we had and where time went.I was delusional myself. Even though I fell into the category I mentioned, I always thought I did not have enough time to do much of what I wanted. I told myself I was busy so I believed in the fact that I was busy. (Gotta confuse yourself before you confuse the enemy). Looking back at it, I was doing busy work and was not busy at all. Had I only scheduled my daily activities, I would have been disciplined.I was presented with countless opportunities to achieve or at least get started on my dreams, but I was lazy (painfully at that) and I was afraid of failure if I took the chance. That fatal combination crippled my self-esteem and poisoned my ambitious soul. I got used to staying in my comfort zone and living the mediocre life I had chosen with the mediocre salary I was receiving. I was pleading for a lightning bolt to the head to wake me from the self-induced coma of life I was living. I wanted some sort of awakening. I woke up. Maybe not fully yet, but I am conscious of my life now.I am learning that no one will live my life for me. Tomorrow is not even guaranteed to come. I am learning to seize all the opportunities that come my way. I am learning to carve my path and head in the direction I want to go, fully aware. I believe that life itself is a journey of self-discovery and that it is never too late to change for the better.As long as we have our health and time, we have no excuse not to be successful in life. Success is relative, so you define yours and go after it. I consider wasting time on meaningless things a betrayal to my heart and intellect. I am taking small steps every day to replace bad habits with productive and good ones. I am doing this now in my 20s; so can anyone else. It is never too late to find your way to the destination for which you are meant.Luul Boru, a graduate of the University of Minnesota, is currently a teacher in Kuwait."
