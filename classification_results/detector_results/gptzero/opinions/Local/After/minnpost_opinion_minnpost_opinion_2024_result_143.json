The surveys that those researchers analyzed for the book have been considered by many to be the gold standard in the field.The source of those surveys was theAmerican National Election Studies program, a collaboration among several research universities. Though officially founded in 1978, the ANES has continuous survey data on the U.S. electorate since 1948. The survey is usually administered every other year but occasionally every fourth year.Since 1952, researchers and pollsters have typically asked a follow-up question to those who identify as independents to determine whether respondents prefer one party over the other if they had to vote. Most independents reported that they lean toward either Democrats or Republicans.So initially, these surveys ask respondents to identify themselves on a three-option scale — Democrat, Republican or independent. But for independents, they probe more deeply, seeking to locate the person being surveyed on a seven-point spectrum between “strong Democrat” and “strong Republican,” with five options in between, to offer a more nuanced look at people’s political preferences.In the 1990s, however, the idea of nuance among independent voters came under scholarly scrutiny. The 1992 book “The Myth of the Independent Voter” argued that there really were only the three main categories and that most people who said they were independentreally preferred one partyor the other.When those independents who report a lean toward a party are counted as supporters of that party, the overall proportion of independents is small — about 10% of the total electorate. That level has remained roughly constant since the 1950s.About two-thirdsof independents lean toward one of the two major political parties’ candidates.However,other scholars, includingme, disagree with the assertion that most independents are really leaning toward a party. We think there is more volatility in their voter patterns when tracked over time.Some researchers have argued that independents’ responses to questions asking whether they lean toward the Democratic or Republican parties aresignificantly affected by short-term factorsrelated to whatever campaign is happening at the time, such as particular candidates and specific issues. This is one reason it would be useful if surveys asked all respondents — not just independents — how closely they identify with one party or the other.In our January 2023 article “The Fluid Voter,” my colleague Dan Hunting and I analyzed ANES data on political identification and voting choices from 1972 to 2020. We observed significant volatility in loyalty to party among independent voters over more than one election. We also found evidence that a sizable number of independents move in and out of independent status from one election to another. We argue there is a need to look at long-term voting behavior of specific voters.So while there’s not consensus on how many independent voters there are in the U.S., their numbers do seem to be growing. The increase may require scholars, media outlets and the public to shift their traditional two-party view of American politics. It’s possible that the long-standing survey questions are no longer — or maybe never were — actually good at identifying political views of independent voters.Thom Reillyis a professor and co-director of the Center for an Independent and Sustainable Democracy at the School of Public Affairs, Arizona State University.This article is republished from The Conversation."
