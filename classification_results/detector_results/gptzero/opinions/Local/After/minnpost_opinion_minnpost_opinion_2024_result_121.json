You may trust your driving prowess, but you can’t vouch for everyone on the road driving. Not every driver has it together; some are pensive, absent minded, spaced out or troubled. Such drivers can get you into an accident, whether you are a defensive or cautious driver or not.I consider myself a very careful and cautious driver, but it was only by God’s grace that I am alive today to tell the story of my involvement in what could have been a ghastly car accident.It was the afternoon of June 24 when I left my residence in southeast St. Cloud to pick up some exigent groceries at Sam’s Club in Sartell. It was a pleasant and enjoyable drive. Once at Sam’s Club, I wasted no time picking up the items I needed and was on my way to a Goodwill thrift store on Second Avenue South in Waite Park.Coming from the north on Second Avenue, I headed south to the store. Upon crossing the intersection of Second Avenue and Division Street while the traffic light was green, a speeding car heading west on Division Street T-boned my car with a crash that sounded like the detonation of an explosive.Thank God we had our seatbelts on! I opened my door on the driver’s side and got out. Leaning over next to the rolled-down window of the other car, I said to the driver: “Now you are no longer in a hurry!” Immediately, a young man stopped, got out of his vehicle, and came over to both drivers involved to ask if we were all right. His was a gesture that conjured up the story of the biblical Good Samaritan in my mind. It was the Good Samaritan, I believe, who called the Waite Park police.As we stood near our wrecked cars, the first police officer to arrive asked us to go to the side of the street lest we might be hit by other vehicles. We did and were standing next to an electric grid pole. A random woman came up and told the police officer that the other driver had run the red light. We both presented our licenses and insurance cards to the police officer. Isolated from each other, we told the police officer what had happened to the best of our knowledge. The police officer asked if I needed an ambulance and learned that I did not.Two tow trucks arrived shortly. The tow truck drivers helped clear the street of debris littered all over from both cars. While we were still standing by the side of the road, the other driver asked me if my family was all right and if I was all right. I told him I thought so, but wondered why he had asked if my family was all right. Unless my family was made up of invisible people, he saw me get out of my car with no one else. He told me he was all right himself, as well. He extended his hand to me for a handshake and told me he was sorry.The police officer asked the other driver to come over to him, which he did. Next, I noticed the police officer subjecting the driver to a sobriety test, which seemed very difficult for him to do. Immediately, I recalled the driver’s question about whether my family was all right.The sobriety test gave me the possible clue as to why he “saw my invisible family.” The picture of the driver was taken by the police officer, and I noticed some police officers searching the man’s car for something. As the tow truck with my car was about to take off, I informed the police sergeant that my groceries were in the trunk of my car. Let me point out at this time that the Waite Park Police were very professional and respectful. The tow truck driver agreed to give me a ride to my residence. Sensing that I could use a helping hand, he helped me carry my groceries to my front door when we got there. I thanked him and he drove off with what was left of the car that was in excellent condition earlier that day in the morning.I received the police report in the mail June 26 and learned later that my car was totaled. I can only credit divine intervention for the fact that all I seem to have sustained were bruises on my elbows and left knee and pain in areas around my left and right shoulder blades. To God be the glory!Anthony Akubue is a resident of St. Cloud."
