Thereare never enough bedsin shelters, and local organizations are always overworked and underresourced,waiting for public fundingthat sometimes doesn’t come. And there aren’t many other places for people to go; a lot of the benches downtown now havebars put in placeso people don’t sleep on them.The man lying on the floor of the train car that rainy day showed me how desensitized I — and so many other people my age — have become to the human suffering we see in Philadelphia every day.As teenagers, we’re learning how the world works; every day I ride the El, I learn that human suffering is all around us, and most people deal with it by ignoring it and moving on. Are these the lessons you want the next generation to learn?I don’t want to have no reaction when someone is passed out on the train. I don’t want anyone who sees it to shrug and move on. This lack of reaction reflects a broader societal problem and should serve as a wake-up call urging us to reconsider our values and priorities.It is not normal for teenagers — or anyone — to be accustomed to these distressing scenes without a genuine emotional response. It’s not normal, and we must do better.Raegan Farlow is in the 12th grade at a Philadelphia public school."
