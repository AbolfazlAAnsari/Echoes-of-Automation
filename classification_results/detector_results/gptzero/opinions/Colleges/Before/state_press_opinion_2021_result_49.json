It is an unacceptable breach of trust with the American people, who need to see that these groups will face consequences for their actions.\nThe far-right groups that stormed the Capitol hadsupport from within the GOP, including far-right conservatives Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) who still peddle in racist, anti-Semitic, and wildly untrue conspiraciesthat threaten national security and the safety of average Americans.\nDespite having denounced QAnonafter being stripped of her House committee assignments, Greene continues to spread conspiracy theories about the election and about President Joe Biden.\nFor Republicans to fail to censure these dangerous radicals, and toinstead censure the only Republicans with the courage to refuse to overturn an election, sets a dangerous precedent, and shows America and the world they cannot trust the Republican Party.\nEach of the aforementioned groups were involved in the Capitol attack, andthe federal government is investigating members of the Proud Boys, Three Percenters and the Oath Keepersfor their involvement in the attempted insurrection.\nThe defense of these groups by Republican senators, and the implicit condoning of the attack through the acquittal of Trump shows these hate groups that they have a home in the Republican Party, and that they will be protected from the repercussions.\nRather than confronting the dangerous elements of their own party — and attempting to reclaim some modicum of decency — Republicans still blame violence on the left, refusing to accept responsibility for the attacks on democracy.\nThey havecompared the Capitol riots to Black Lives Matter protestsover the summer, and some have gone as far as to blame some of the violence on \"Antifa,\" which isn't an organization but an ideology. Still, anti-fascist groups had no involvement in the Capitol insurrection.\n\"I don't think those are fair comparisons at all, (on one hand) you have people who have been oppressed for hundreds of years fighting for basic human rights, just trying not to be killed by police, on the other hand you have neo-nazis and white supremacists who are just throwing a fit,\" said Cameron Adams, president of ASU Young Democrats.\n\"I don't know if they actually believe it, or if they are just creating it to have their supporters believe it,\" said Adams, a junior studying global studies.\nThis false equivalency is a blatant attempt to shove responsibility for hate groups off of the Republican Party, and it is not fooling anyone.\nWhile these groups were certainly emboldened by having blatant white supremacy spewed daily by the former president, the Republican Party is led by enablers that have allowed these hateful groups and their despicable rhetoric to fester throughout the party, and they must act against these groups before they hurt anyone else.\n\"I think it really falls on their leaders, the Republican Party, to get their act together,\" Adams said.\nAnd until Republican leadership stops enabling harmful conspiracies, we as Americans should not let them anywhere near government or positions of power, because they have shown countless times they will only abuse it to harm those in our society who are most vulnerable.\nDemocracy is fragile, and our nation is fragile. Republicans have preyed upon the desperate to fuel hate and bigotry and use these things to destabilize our government and keep themselves in power.\nThey must act to protect America from hate groups and conspiracy theories, or they will be complicit in the destruction of our nation.\nGet your act together, Republicans, or get out.\nReach the columnist attkgerald@asu.eduor follow@TKGeraldMusicon Twitter.\nEditor’s note: The opinions presented in this column are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
