            "inputText": "As coronavirus ravages the world, technologists have found ways to help fight the pandemic. Some have built valuable new products, ranging frommapsof case counts toclearinghousesthat match hospitals with suppliers of personal protective equipment. Others have marshaled existing technologies likeGoogle’s protein-folding AIandIBM’s Summit supercomputerto accelerate treatments for the virus.\nSpecific leaders in the tech sector have also helped. Bill Gates, who has worked on pandemic prevention formany years, is supporting at-home coronavirus test kits developed by apartnershipbetween scientists and public health officials. Mark Zuckerberg, who has taken coronavirus seriously since January,greenlightednew features on Facebook to promote information about the virus from authoritative sources.\nHowever, other technologists are being unhelpful, or worse, outright harmful.\nElon Musk is one such example. The contrarian CEO of Tesla didn’t justtweet irresponsiblyand peddlequestionable “research”about potential treatments. He alsodefiedan order from Alameda County to shut down the Tesla factory in Fremont because he personally felt the “coronavirus panic is dumb.” Two weeks later, Muskofferedto send ventilators to hospitals in New York, but the machines he sent were actually BPAP machines designed to treat sleep apnea —far from perfect replacementsfor the ventilators that hospitalsdesperately need. Meanwhile, Musk’sofferto build ventilators at Tesla factories was panned by ventilator manufacturersbecause“the core technology of today’s ventilators … is fundamentally different from the manufacturing operations of car manufacturers.”\nMusk isn’t the only technologist brandishing a holier-than-thou attitude toward coronavirus. In late March, product manager Aaron Ginn acted like hisexperience“driving rapid and viral adoption of technology products” made him qualified to analyze epidemiological data. Ginn concluded that the U.S. response was overblown and posted his shoddy analysis on Medium. Afterextensive pushbackfrom infectious-disease expert Carl Bergstrom, Medium finallytook down the article, but not before it garnered millions of views.\nWhat differentiates technologists’ good efforts from dangerous ones? I believe the answer boils down to one trait: arrogance.\nIn fighting coronavirus, Gates and Zuckerberg are contributing in ways that support, not undermine, the work of experts. That’s humility. Meanwhile, Musk, Ginnand companyseem to believe they’re qualified to analyze epidemiological data and build healthcare products without proper training or expertise. That’s arrogance.\nThis isn’t a new problem — Silicon Valley has beenrepeatedlycriticizedforitsarrogance. At times, this hubris isentertaining, perhaps even afeature, not a bug. But when the Valley views its contributions throughrose-colored spectacles, it filters out legitimate concerns behind new technological products and services. This idealism, embodied in Facebook’s old mantra “move fast and break things,” fuels araceto quickly create new products with limited concern for their broader social implications, while ensuing scandals like Cambridge Analyticademonstratethe need for more thoughtfulness. In his lastletterto investors, Google co-founder Sergey Brin M.S. ’95 summarized this problem: “While I am optimistic about the potential to bring technology to bear on the greatest problems in the world, we are on a path that we must tread with deep responsibility, care and humility.”\nToday, we are on a path we must tread with even deeper responsibility, care and humility.\nCoronavirus, in both scope and intensity, is unlike any other modern problem. Building a new product is already difficult under the normal pressures of Silicon Valley, wheremost startups fail. Within the realm of coronavirus, creating something new is even more difficult — we can’t “break things” when we’re dealing with human lives. There’s a slew of other issues too, such asprivacyandequity, that require serious consideration. Despite these challenges, even if someone builds something valuable, public health officials would have to divert time and money to help scale these largely-untested products. As the host of a March in-person(!) coronavirus hackathon in Texasput it, “Nobody has acknowledged our work yet. They haven’t used it or shared it yet.”\nIf rapidly building solutions to tackle enormous problems sounds familiar, perhaps you remember Stanford’s response to campus hate crimes. The administration proposed a “Hacking Hate” event, where students had five hours to research and propose innovative ways to address racial hate and violence. In response, Jasmine Sun ’21articulatedhow racism is a complicated, multi-pronged problem that can’t be solved by “hacking.” She proceeded to describe Silicon Valley’s saviorism problem, where “inexperienced innovators parachute into a community they don’t understand to build products that no one needs, claiming a resume line and virtue signaling along the way.”\nI worry that some of Stanford’smultiplenewclassesand student-driven initiatives to fight coronavirus are falling into the same trap. For example, the Stanford COVID-19 Response Innovation Lab is pitching itself to students bysayingthat they have “an unprecedented opportunity to change lives and save the world by rapidly building and scaling high-impact ventures together to combat the pandemic.” I can’t help but notice the parallels between the aforementioned saviorism problem and a literal call to save the world.\nWhile some technologists try to parachute into the world of pandemic mitigation, countless epidemiologists, virologists and public health officials have already mobilized. This bandwagoning risks diluting the expertise of actual experts — with potentially catastrophic consequences. For example, while the nation’s top medical experts are trying to shape evidence-based policies, President Donald Trump isreportedlylistening to tech executives’ conspiracy theories about potential treatments. Even the president’simpulsive,dangerousobsessionwith the drug hydroxychloroquine has beentracedback to research conducted by full-time cryptocurrency investors andpopularizedby tech executives.\nOf course, it’s not just technologists who need a dose of humility. Manyscientists,journalistsandpoliticianshave also demonstrated arrogance, and we should oppose that too. However, a crucial difference lies in the varied difficulty of spotting mistakes. Science, journalism and politics have developed robust institutions and standards for fact-checking claims, but tech relies on metrics like fundraising and popularity to determine what’s “good” and what’s “bad.” In a pandemic, this means we are ill-equipped to quickly stop data-driven analyses and products which seem legitimate to the broader public, butfall apart under scrutiny. As Bergstromput it, “A form of authority gets imposed on a reader and we tend not to challenge data the way we’ve learned to challenge words.”\nWith coronavirus, it’s easy to start contributing with technical skills, hard to verify if those contributions are helpful, and dangerous if those contributions are wrong. So how can we avoid these pitfalls while fulfilling our desire to help?\nIn the effort to limit the spread of coronavirus, the people on the ground — those who’ve been leading the fight against coronavirus for weeks — know what they need to be more effective. Let’s follow their lead. One way to do that is by joining theU.S. Digital Response, which screens volunteers and matches them to projects for federal, state and local governments.\nAdditionally, this pandemic will also have far-reaching effects across society. We must start thinking about recovery efforts now, including from a technical angle. Let’s help build thehuman-centered safety netthat we’ll desperately need in a post-coronavirus world. One way to do that is by serving a “tour of civic service,” helping to build and scale essential government systems.\nThere are many other things we can do that don’t require technical skills. We can care for our friends and family. We can check in on our elderly neighbors. We canjoin the Crisis Text Lineto help people in distress during and after the pandemic. We canstand up for service workerswho aren’t being paid during this crisis. We can support food banks and homeless shelters, includingstruggling onesin Silicon Valley’s backyard.\nWe can wash our hands and practice social distancing.\nNone of these ideas require building something from scratch, but all of them require a significant dose of humility. None of these ideas will single-handedly save the world, but all of them will help flatten the curve and rebuild a functioning society.\nToday, we face a problem where numbers don’t represent ad revenues or active users. Rather, these numbers represent the lives of real people, with unique stories and grieving families. We owe it to them to proceed with the deepest sense of responsibility, care and humility.\nNik Marda ’21 is a M.S. candidate in computer science.\nContact Nik Marda at nmarda ‘at’stanford.edu.\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.
