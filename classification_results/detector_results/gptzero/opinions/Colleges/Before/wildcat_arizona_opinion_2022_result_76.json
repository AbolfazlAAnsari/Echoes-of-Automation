Including one ofNASA’s climate scientistsPeter Kalmus pleading, “we’re going to lose everything. We’re not joking. We’re not lying and we’re not exaggerating,” as he stood outside of the JP Morgan building in Los Angeles.\nMost college students understand the devastating impacts of climate change and the action that needs to be taken to mitigate irreversible damage.

However, several do not know where to begin, how to take action or how to get involved. Fortunately, Earth Day 2022 is on April 22 and there are several upcoming events where students can learn how to take action in their individual lives and on a larger level.\nEarth Day is a significant holiday each year because it’s used to acknowledge the problems our society faces with climate change while also encouraging more support across the globe for protecting our environment and creating positive change. Earth Day is extremely crucial in regard to the climate emergency because, in order to legislate fundamental change, our governments must realize the urge to have environmental issues be at the head of policy decisions.\nAt the University of Arizona organizations like Students For Sustainability and UA Divest are planning events centered around Earth Day throughout the week that are open to all students.
