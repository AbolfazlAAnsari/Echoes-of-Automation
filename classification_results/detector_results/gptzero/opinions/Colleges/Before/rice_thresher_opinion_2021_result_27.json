            "inputText": "ByThresher Editorial Board8/24/21 10:50pm\nOn May 24 of this year, Chair of the Crisis Management Advisory Committee Kevin Kirbysent an emailto the Rice community, informing everyone that the Crisis Management Team would “cease its formal COVID-19 organization and operations” by the end of that week. This cameexactly one weekafter the Crisis Management Team had lifted the indoor mask mandate for vaccinated individuals, essentially returning campus activity to normal. Almost two months prior, President David Leebron had penned alettersignaling the administration's intent to proceed with a relatively normal fall semester. All in all, it was clear that Kirby’s email regarding the cease of CMT operations was the culmination of a year-long effort to return a sense of normalcy to campus.\nThe summer proceeded without a hitch, with COVID-related indoor-gathering restrictions beingremovedon June 21. But on Aug. 3, Kirby sent another email, whichstated that, due to the surging Delta variant, further restrictions — like indoor masking except for when actively eating or drinking — would be put in place. The August 3 email also announced the reactivation of the CMT.\nFollowing an apparent surge in cases during Orientation Week, the administration implemented some temporary changes:as of Aug. 19, the start of classes were pushed back two days and the first two weeks of instruction were now virtual.\nThroughout last year, the Rice communityprided itselfon staying ahead of COVID, and never letting the virus gain any sort of foothold on campus. But from Aug. 3 onwards, the administration has been reactive instead of proactive. They responded late to theDelta surge, not providing proper time to set up the necessary testing infrastructure to test everyone upon arrival to campus. There was also a shortage of isolation housing due to the volume of students returning to campus this fall. Because of this, they were then forced to respond to what appeared to be an influx of positive cases in the midst of O-Week and quickly reinstate many restrictions.\nIt was the decision to fully disband CMT and reduce testing capacity that created the reactive situation we found ourselves in throughout the month of August. Without the infrastructure to identify and isolate positive cases, which could have been anticipated due to theprevalenceandhigher transmissibilityof the Delta variant, Rice took many steps back to retroactively hinder the spread of the virus.\nTo be fair, implementing two weeks of remote instruction, while reactionary to whatturned out to be false positives, does provide time to get everyone tested and allow CMT to determine what restrictions are needed moving forward. Assuming everything goes according to plan, and cases in the Houston area decline as expected, we may see a return to semi-normalcy in the next month or two.\nBut what both Delta and the false-positives debacle proved is that things rarely go according to plan. Even if the situation is better a month from now, and the university is able to roll back most restrictions, we ask that administration not make a premature decision to disband the infrastructure that allows us to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19 on campus. As long as the rest of the world is still battling the pandemic, we cannot fully let our guard down. Otherwise, each August will see as chaotic a return to campus as we witnessed last week.\nEditor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board.

As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
