As we all know, next year will bring many challenges (as this past quarter has so clearly demonstrated) and at all points throughout the process, the ASSU hopes to ensure that student opinions and perspectives are front and center. The Faculty Senate will decide the grading basis for the coming months on Thursday and this document presents thekey insights from a student body wide survey administered on the subject. You can find the full, albeit less polished, survey resultshere.\nThank you to all students who responded to the survey. As of July 28th, there were 3,717responses  (118,328 words of textual responses!) distributed among class year as follows:\nKey Takeaways\nHow did Spring Quarter Go?\nThere were a number of key takeaways on students’ perspectives about learning and grading during Spring Quarter:\nBarriers to Learning\nThe chart below shows the barriers students faced in the Spring:\nThe data suggests thatinequity in learning situations will continue in the Fall,only slightly diminished and that those with the most barriers to their learning struggled the most with online learning.\nLooking to the Fall\nAs we approach the Fall, there is every reason to believe that students will continue to face challenges:\nDespite the challenges, there is reason to believe next year could be less tumultuous than the Spring:\nGrading Preferences\nThe two charts below show general preferences for the grading basis. The first shows the average number of stars out of 5 assigned to each. The second shows the average ranking position (where 1 is the highest rank possible/most preferred). As you can see, students prefered Universal S/NC when asked to assign stars and preferred Optional CR/NC when asked to rank options — both by small margins.\nThere were a number of other key implications for grading:\nLeaves of Absence\nFew responded they had plans to take a leave, but many (around 25% of Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors) remain undecided. A small methodological note is that there is likely a response bias at play: those who are planning to take a leave would have less of an incentive to complete the survey.\nAs always, your feedback, opinions, and questions are welcome. Ultimately this decision will be made by the Faculty Senate, and the ASSU is here to support you and to advocate for the best possible policies. Feel free to learn more about the Faculty Senate or request to watch Thursday’s meeting athttps://facultysenate.stanford.edu.\nSincerely yours,\nJonathan Lipman ’21, ASSU Undergraduate Senator (he/him)\nContact Jonathan Lipman at jlipman ‘at’ stanford.edu.\n\n"
