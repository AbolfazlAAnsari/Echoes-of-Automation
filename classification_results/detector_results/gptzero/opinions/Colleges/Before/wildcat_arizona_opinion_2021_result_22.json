            "inputText": "I’m a Mexican-American woman and my first language was Spanish. Soon after I learned English. In my parents’ household, we mainly speak English with occasional Spanish conversations.\nBeing bilingual has helped me in different situations in life, whether it’s at work, helping someone or simply communicating. I’m grateful that I’m able to easily interact with twice the amount of people, and I encourage others to take this on too. Learning another language, or at least Spanish, will benefit you and help you stand out.\nUnderstanding one another’s culture:\nPart of speaking or learning a second language comes with understanding the culture behind it. To have the means to speak with someone from another culture allows you to expand your mind. A simple conversation with an older person who only speaks their native language will tell you a lot about what they’ve seen in their life.\nHaving these experiences can make you a better person and all-around more open-minded. You might even be able to relate with each other during said conversation and you’ll understand that we really are all alike.\nRELATED:OPINION: Vaccinations and masks are more than just political, they are common decency\nNobody is judging you for messing up:\nFrom my experience, nobody has ever made fun of me when I mess up on a Spanish word. I still sometimes mess up because I primarily speak English. I can vouch that you can learn a language and still not understand it unless you put it to practice.\nI think that some people pick a language to learn because they happen to like that country and plan to visit one day. If you know a second language, make sure you are putting it to practice. Holding these “conversations” out loud (even if you have to talk to yourself) will only make you better!\nBelieve it or not, many foreigners don’t care if you mess up with their language. What matters is that you are genuinely invested in their language and culture enough to try.\nMoving into a multilingual society:\nI can confidently assume that most of you have heard the idea that English will not be the main language in about 30 years, right? Research conducted by the University of Cambridge shows that by2050, any sacred lingua franca, which is currently English, “will have met its demise.” Merriam-Webster’s definition oflingua francais, “any of various languages used as common or commercial tongues among peoples of diverse speech.” You have 29 years to figure something out! In my mind, as long as you know enough of a language to get by, you will communicate easier than you imagined.\nRELATED:OPINION: More schoolwork in college means less effort from students\nIt’s happening already:\nMesquite Elementary School in Vail, Arizona, is aChinese Immersion schooland teaches in both Mandarin and English. Tucson Unified School District caters to bilingual students and those who want to become bilingual. TUSD offers a “Two-Way Dual Language” program, which allows students to learn a second language while reinforcing their primary language.\nI encourage you to consider taking advantage of the many resources available that aid in learning another language. We are a species that craves communication and we should keep at that.\nFollow Jacqueline Aguilar onTwitter\n\nJacqueline (she/her), born and raised in Arizona, is a senior studying digital journalism and information science & eSociety.
