For someone to consider themselves a leader, they must also consider themselves a person of service.\nTo serve others, leaders must take ownership in understanding the external and intrinsic factors that shape their constituents’ lives. As elections draw near, running politicians should course with integrity and a solution-based platform.\nMany communities in Arizona are facing different challenges. Those challenges should be approached with unique intentionality instead of a cookie-cutter perspective that all problems are created equal.\nLeaders must have a vision.\nPoliticians have a reputation. Politics have a reputation. Apart from that, reputation is the lack of vision. The leaders of this state must be able to lead past today's challenges and lean into tomorrow's possibilities. From sustainability efforts to creating equity in K-12 education, leaders are responsible for shaping and leveraging a better, brighter future for all its citizens.\nHumble yourselves.\nLeaders are not the most brilliant people in the room but the most resourceful ones. Recruit and onboard diverse talent that can help cultivate meaningful changes in the communities you serve. Systems are not systems. They are made up of people. And those people make decisions that create long-lasting ripple effects in the ecosystem. Listen and learn from those around you more than your dictate and speak.\nHumility will lead you with humanity's best intentions. Lead forward.\nEdited by Sadie Buggle, Piper Hansen and Kristen Apolline Castillo.\nEbony Anderson is the assistant director of the cultural connections for ASU's Educational Outreach and Student Services and advisor for the Black African Coalition.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
