            "inputText": "\"Despite a focus on business and innovation, ASU is still a top party school.\" Illustration published on Thursday, Sept. 10, 2020.\nASU was long known as one of thetop party schoolsin the U.S., and even though the University has undertaken a general pivot toward business and \"innovation\" under the leadership of President Michael Crow, it's still safe to say we know how to party better than many our age.\nDespite those facts, ASU decided to invite students back to campus during a pandemic. This was an unwise decision to say the least, but the University has also decidedto suspendstudents for violating social distancing guidelines.\nI wrotea columnearlier this year pleading the case against partying. Even then, I said no amount of scolding or chiding would actually stop college-aged students from attending parties and meeting friends.\nIn addition to the official sanctions against large gatherings, the University has implemented an irritatingdaily health checkregimen online and significantly modified classrooms to support an ASU Sync system to allow for hybrid in-person and remote learning.\nDespite these measures, ASU stillreporteda cumulative 1,413positive COVID-19 tests among faculty and students since Aug. 1.\nInstead of blaming individual students for spreading the virus at parties and social gatherings, we should blame ASU for helping create the conditions needed for these parties and gatherings in the first place.\nWhy are y'all so surprised at videos of college students partying? Like ok grandma what do you expect a bunch of 18-23 year olds to do on campus? Stay in their rooms?\nDylan Brooks is a senior studying business and computer information systems. An out-of-state student from Colorado, Brooks said he was doubtful of ASU's decision to reopen.\n\"I personally was always a little bit more pessimistic, especially as the summer began and progressed. It didn't look like in-person classes would be possible or prudent in any way,\" Brooks said.\nBrooks also said the ASU Sync system has not met his expectations.\n\"It does feel a little bit dishonest that ASU Sync was initially marketed as 'in person, along with Zoom,'\" Brooks said. \"In all my classes, it's ended up just being a complete flop with the numbers of students attending in-person dropping pretty much every single class period.\"\nReferring specifically to the daily health check, Brooks said ASU's preventative measures are likely a means to protect the University from accusations that it's spreading COVID-19.\"Speaking of the health check, I think it's pretty much worthless,\" Brooks said. \"It seems much more for the appearance of the University. It's another thing to list off that they're doing (it) in order to prevent COVID from from spreading.\"\nBrooks said the blame for COVID-19's spread at parties doesn't fall squarely on the shoulders of students.\n\"It's very difficult to say whether you know it's really on students for throwing these honestly reckless parties, or whether they're just simply acting how college students are going to act in these kind of situations,\" Brooks said. \"Of course, if you're bringing ASU college students back to ASU, this is how they're going to act.\"\nIf ASU really wants to stop the spread of COVID-19 among the students and faculty, then the administration should cancel in-person classes and provide full refunds for in-person housing, meals and tuition. Blaming students is a way to deflect the University's responsibility for the cases in our community.\nReach the columnist atsmisceni@asu.eduor follow@IMiscenichon Twitter.\nEditor’s note: The opinions presented in this column are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
