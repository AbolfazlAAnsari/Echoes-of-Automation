The butt of the joke is that Black culture and language is incompatible with their non-Black — or, more accurately, anti-Black — lives.\nThe perception of AAVE as representing a lack of education reveals itself when a certain word or phrase gains so much popularity that it is described as “Gen Z slang” or “stan culture.” This mistakenly positions AAVE as a confused version of Standard American English with bad grammar. Needless to say, an integral part of Black culture can’t be learned by going on TikTok, just like you can’t be fluent in a language by learning all the swear words. AAVE is a dialect built upon centuries of oppression, and non-Black people continue to disrespect its history when they appropriate broken AAVE into their own speech, treating the vernacular as a playground rather than a dialect.\nIt also takes a toll on Black students to have their culture stripped away from them as early aselementary school, as they watch their peers getting to enjoy AAVE without consequence. Most Black students who grow up speaking AAVE have a distinct memory of being told to speak “properly,” as if deviating from the confines of Standard American English was any measure of intelligence. As a result, Black youth are forced to either learn how to code switch, or choose whatJoanne L. Vaccadescribes as a single loyalty to either white academia or Black culture. And whether it be pursuing higher education,housing,careersor evenhealthcare, Black people have been conditioned to linguistically assimilate as a survival tactic.\nToni Morrisonwrites: “The systematic looting of language can be recognized by the tendency of its users to forgo its nuanced, complex, midwifery properties for menace and subjugation.” When non-black people call me sis, as well intentioned as they may portray themselves, they replace the solidarity between Black women with their entitlement to looted language.\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.
