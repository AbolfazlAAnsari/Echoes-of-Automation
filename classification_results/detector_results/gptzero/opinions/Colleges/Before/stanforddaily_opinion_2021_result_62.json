            "inputText": "As students, alumni, faculty and staff of Stanford University, we write to express our disappointment, outrage and concern regarding the recent attacks on Emily Wilder ‘20 and other students by the Stanford College Republicans (SCR), and to demand that the University issue a strong and unequivocal statement on community standards as well as initiate an investigation to determine whether SCR’s actions constitute a violation of theFundamental Standard.\nBeginning on May 17, and following Ms. Wilder’s April 10announcement on Twitterthat she had been hired by the Associated Press (AP) to cover local news in Arizona, SCR took toTwitterandFacebookto publish years-old screenshots of social media posts andStanford Dailyarticles that Ms. Wilder published while an undergraduate at Stanford. These posts, which related to Ms. Wilder’s opinions on the Israeli occupation of Palestine, falsely accused her, a Jewish woman who attended an Orthodox Jewish high school for girls, ofpromoting “blood libel”, of“fomenting” anti-Semitic violence by “leftist-Islamist thugs,”and of “[defending] students who threatened violence against Jews.” In addition to describing Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) as a “terrorist-affiliated” organization, SCR described Ms. Wilder as “unhinged,” as a “Marxist agitator” and as a “militant anti-Israel agitator.” Finally, the organization retweeted posts that described her as part of a cadre of “hate-filled terrorists” and as indicative of the AP’s “Hamas connection” andleviedattacksagainst Stanford professors who defended her on Twitter. SCR presented thislibelous and defamatory campaignagainst Ms. Wilder as an effort to “expose” the Associated Press and to “[hold] the media accountable” for what SCR deemed its “egregious anti-Israel bias,” thereby takingdirect aim at Emily’s new job. As part of this presentation, SCR promoted theunsubstantiated conspiracy theorythat the AP has collaborated with Hamas.\nSCR’s social media posts were amplified and re-posted by prominent right-wing politicians and commentators. Before long,The Washington Free BeaconandThe Federalist, both conservative publications, had posted articles about Ms. Wilder’s hiring by the AP, and she was besieged by vicious online harassment and bullying. The AP initially expressed support for her, offered to help her manage the harassment and bullying she was experiencing, and assured her that she would not be fired for her past campus activism. On May 19, however,the AP fired Emily for purported violationsof the news agency’s social media policy between the time of her hiring and May 19, refused to tell her which posts had been in violation of this policy, and acknowledged that the news agency’s review of her social media accounts was precipitated by SCR’s campaign.Manyprominentjournalists,politicians,academicsandactivistson both sidesof the political spectrum have sinceexpressedsupportfor Ms. Wilder,argued that none of her tweetsin that three-week period merited dismissal,criticized the double standardto which media organizations are held regarding alleged conflicts of interest on the issue of Israel and Palestine andnoted that Ms. Wilderwould not have been contributing in any way to the AP’s coverage of the Israeli occupation of Palestine in her capacity as an Arizona-based news associate. SCR, meanwhile, hascelebrated Ms. Wilder’s firingand publiclyclaimedcreditfor her dismissal from the AP.\nThe campaign targeting Emily leaves us, as members of the Stanford community, with the task of reckoning with how SCR’s actions reflect upon our university, our community, and our campus culture. It is transparent that SCR’s campaign was made in bad faith and was rooted in malicious intent: The aim of this campaign was not to engage in debate or to voice disagreement with something Ms. Wilder had written or said, but rather, to defame her and derail her career.These types of actions by SCR, which are designed to intimidate and suppress campus activists with whom SCR disagrees, are fundamentally antithetical to a campus culture grounded in the principles of academic freedom and freedom of speech.How are we to feel safe expressing a range of different opinions on controversial and polemical topics if we fear retaliation by our own peers? How are we to trust Stanford as a forum for public debate if our own university implicitly condones the activities of Voluntary Student Organizations (VSOs) that systematically target fellow students’ reputations and livelihoods on the basis of their political opinions? Ultimately, SCR’s actions foster a vicious, violent campus culture that is far from the welcoming, convivial, and collegial atmosphere to which we, the undersigned, aspire.\nOn this subject, current Stanford student Maxwell Meyer asserts in arecent article in theStanford Review, “Free exchange of ideas without reprisal? I call BS. SCR’s words in their ‘vision statement’ say one thing, but their actions when they encounter another student with strong disagreements say another,” noting that SCR’s attack on Ms. Wilder crosses a line and has compelled him, a fellow conservative and a supporter of Israel, to speak out against the organization. Thus we see that SCR’s smear campaigns misrepresent the views of conservative students at Stanford, and that the organization’s pattern of behavior also reflects poorly on the state of civil discourse at our university. In the end, SCR functions less as a representative student organization than as afeeder for the right-wing media.\nThe University’s failure to hold SCR accountable for past actions, furthermore, has created a culture of mistrust in Stanford’s commitment to uphold its own community standards and stated ideals of diversity and inclusion. Many students fundamentally do not trust the Organization Conduct Board (OCB) and other relevant authorities to uphold community values, given thehistorical impunity of SCR from disciplinary processes. The smear campaign against Ms. Wilder, after all, forms part of alargeranddeeply disturbingpattern of behavior by SCR. While this may be one of the most high-profile instances of efforts by SCR to destroy particular students’ reputations and academic as well as professional pursuits, it is not the first. In fact,SCR has launched smear campaignsagainst individual students several times in the past year alone, exposing these students to vicious and dangerous online harassment and bullying. SCR’s campaigns disproportionately impact women and people of color, thereby exacerbating racial and gender inequities at Stanford.These campaigns have also increased in ferocity and sophistication, particularly in this academic year, and Stanford’s reticence in holding the group accountable has given SCR license to intensify its attacks.\nWe want to be clear: Though we, the undersigned, may hold differing opinions on a range of issues, including that of Israel and Palestine, we condemn SCR’s tactics and support Ms. Wilder as well as every other Stanford community member who has been victim to attacks by SCR.We oppose a campus culture in which students intentionally undermine each other’s careers, subject each other to violent harassment and intimidate each other over differences of political opinion.We have been gratified to witness thewave of supportfor Emily from Stanford students,alumniandfaculty, including many whodisagreewith her stance on the Israeli occupation of Palestine and who have stillspoken upabout their respect for her and for her work. We urge the Stanford community to continue showing support for Ms. Wilder and the other community members who have been attacked by SCR in recent months and years. Though unacknowledged by the university at large, the group’s pattern of abusehas not gone unnoticed.\nIn light of SCR’s actions, we demand that Stanford:\nSCR’s behavior is unconscionable, shameful, and dangerous. The University is responsible for ensuring our safety and our academic freedom at Stanford, and we expect the University to fulfill this obligation to its community.\nLink to the petition formhere.\nSee the full list of signatorieshere.\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.
