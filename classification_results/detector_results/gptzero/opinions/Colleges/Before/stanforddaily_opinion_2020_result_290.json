            "inputText": "We are fighting a war. The aggressor is invisible, but the effects are the same: a ravaged economy, physical, social and emotional harm to our loved ones and a threat to our way of life. We must mobilize now to win this war.\nThe hard truth is that sheltering in place will only slow the onslaught of the coronavirus.It willnotstop it. Barring the quick deployment of a vaccine or an effective treatment, or complete success in halting viral transmission, the virus will only relent once a majority of the population has been infected and we have sufficientherd immunity. Our current actions are only buying time. That timemust not be wasted. We must use it to prepare and fight back.\nAccording to a Harvard study, at the peak of the pandemic, with a conservative 40% of the population infected over the next 6-12 months, we will need more than double the bed capacity and triple the ICU capacity to care for those infected by the virus. In addition to beds and facilities, we will need caregivers, ventilators, masks, gloves and many other supplies. This is a massive task. We need to turn our attention as a country to building that capacity right now.\nThe alternative strategy, which has now been instituted in California and New York, is to “shelter in place” in order to slow the pace of the pandemic to fit our current capacity. Unfortunately, this action alone is unlikely to be sufficient. Absent the strict and extreme controls that have been achieved in China (and which may not be feasible in the U.S. and Europe),a recent Imperial College analysisconcludes that “flattening the curve” sufficiently would require that we shelter in place for at least 12-18 months until a vaccine or effective treatment is available. The decimation of our economy that would occur in that time frame is enormous — as financial markets and unemployment claims are only beginning to show. More importantly, the social costs of unemployment, gaps in education, social isolation and depression might rival or well exceed those from the virus.\nFinally, and worst of all, the shelter-in-place approach may eventually break down (as was the casefor instanceduring social distancing measures at Delaware during H1N1 in 2009). As the economic and social costs mount, many may revolt against being kept in their homes. In that case we would pay a huge economic cost firstand thensuffer the ravages of the pandemic.\nTo avoid this grim outcome, we must act now to mobilize our nation’s incredible resources to expand our capacity to confront the virus in a realistic time frame. Much like the switching of automobile and other factories to military production during the second world war, we need to develop andadminister tests, fast-track potential treatments, create temporary hospitalization facilities, train caregivers andmanufacture ventilatorsat a large scale. We must also do more to make social distancing a practical reality without necessitating a full shutdown of the economy and society.By combining these efforts, we can sustainably slow the progression of the virus while preparing for its inevitable arrival.\nIn this effort we must respond as a committed and united country as we have to other such wars. Until a treatment arrives, we must all do our part. As a concrete proposal, we suggest the following be considered within our own Stanford community:\n1.Build capacity.Convert available buildings, such as our now-empty dorm buildings, to temporary quarantine/hospitalization quarters for the infected. They could be filled by cohorts of less critical but still infected patients in need of observation, or be used by patients with other, non-contagious illnesses to free up existing hospital capacity (as is already being considered atTuftsandelsewhere).\n2.Train caregivers.Medical students, staff, faculty and other community volunteers (whose age and health suggest they are unlikely to be harmed by the virus) can be trained to serve as caregivers for the infirm or isolated, as well as providing much needed infrastructure support to those who are on the front line.\n3.Design ventilators.Engage our design and engineering schools to develop an easy and quick-to-manufacture ventilator. AsStanford’s Design For Extreme Affordability Programhas done in the past, we can design simple mechanical ventilators like thosefirst developed to save lives in the 1950s. These do not need to be “hospital quality” by our current standards; basic functionality and a 12-month life span will suffice. No one should die due to lack of a ventilator.\n4.Invest in testing and temperature monitoring.Work with our medical school and business supply chain experts to develop fast, cheap and easy-to-deploy tests. We must reach the point that tests are no longer rationed. But even without testing, we must encourage individuals to monitor their temperature multiple times per day, as is being done inSingapore(where it is also required upon entry or exit of buildings and public spaces).\n5.Manage the network.Engage our MBA and CS students to develop an app that will track and quickly alert all physical contacts in the event of a positive test or temperature reading. (Such an app has been essential toChina’s success.) To address privacy concerns, make the app voluntary, easy to delete, with encrypted data, and not controlled by the government. Achieve compliance by promoting a social norm that people socially distance from others who are not being tested and using the app. Develop a real-time reporting system to a central information aggregator that can alert hospitals and health care providers. Provide a financial or other reward system for those who comply with monitoring and follow quarantine recommendations.\nThese are all things for which planning could be initiated immediately. And with our collective effort, intelligence and willpower, we could accomplish much quickly. Until science provides a cure, we cannot stand idle or remain focused on our private interests.  We must prepare to fight this war and motivate others to join the effort.\n— Professors Peter DeMarzo, Hanno Lustig and Amit SeruStanford Graduate School of Business (GSB)\nTo add your name in support, pleaseclick here.\nAdditional Signatories:Prof. Anat Admati, GSBProf. Jonathan Berk, GSBProf. Laura Blattner, GSBProf. Darrell Duffie, GSBProf. Peter Koudijs, GSBProf. Arvind Krishnamurthy, GSBProf. Ilya Strebulaev, GSBProf. Kenneth Singleton, GSBProf. Greg Buchak, GSBJosh Payne, CS, GSBHolly Dinkel, Aeronautics and AstronauticsAhmed Elbakri,  GSBRebecca Zhang, GSBMichael Martin, GSBMr. Daniel Uribe, GSBHeather Nguyen, GSBLaura Du, GSBAbhi Mukerji, GSBLuke Knepper, GSB MBA2Alexander Schmidt, GSB MBA1Jes Simson, GSBMarc Busch, GSBGraham Wookey, GSBOliver Lu, GSBLuciana Barrancos, GSBJanna Wandzilak, GSBKorn Lapprathana, GSBWilliam McLaughlin, GSB ’21Vivas Kumar, GSB MBA ’21Bianca Jackson, GSBMariana Martins,  GSBJonathan Morales, CS UndergraduateZac Portnoy, GSBNell Brodsky, GSB ’21Felipe Kettlun, GSB and CSJenn Kalidoss, EE and GSBAlan Jaime,GSB MBA1Ulysses Velasquez, GSBDiana Nassar,GSB MBA2Bianca Pinasco, GSBRoss Bowen, GSBHenry Bradlow, GSBAnnie Garofalo, GSBNicholas Mirda, GSBJio Park, GSB ’21Hardik Patel, GSB MBA ’21Mindy Chang, GSBJohn Drago, MBA1Danielle Diuguid, MBA/MA in Education, 2021Nadav Ziv, UndergraduateHuggy Rao, GSBAngela Sinisterra-Woods, MBA2Clinical Professor Donald Born, SoMLadd Hamrick, GSB MBA StudentRachel Schuh, EconomicsStephen Rickli, GSB ’20Allegra Tepper, GSBSigalit Perelson, SymSys ’20Ms. Kelly Walsh, StaffEllery Berk, GSBCatherine Jiang, Symbolic SystemsDanran Chen,GSB MBA ’21Neal Amsden, MBA ’84Susan Alexander,DCIChrista Amsden, GSBDom Mirabile, GSB ’21Brandee Barker, DCIMaddie Dean, GSB MBA ’20Ellidia Guan Dupont, GSBDanielle Carattini, GSB StaffProf. Robert Hall, Hoover InstitutionSara Singer, SOM and GSBJacqueline Genovese, SOM, Medicine & the MuseDavid,GSB staffErtem Nusret Tas, Graduate Student, Electrical EngineeringVictoria Germanova, GSB MBA ’21Renata Giarola, GSBAlex Jaso, GSBDr. Ryan McLean, GSBHans Wydler, Harvard MBA 1993Mitchel Peterman, GSBFernando R Rodriguez, MS / MPPNathan Marshall, undergraduateAlec Merkulov, GSB, MBA1Joan Menees, StaffJulie Leong, GSB StaffProfessor Jim Van Horne, GSBIsaac Dabbah, LSCA TEC MEXICOSingari Seshadri, GSB StaffBrian Aoyama, GSBProf. David Larcker, GSBProfessor Wes Hartmann, GSBLyn Hansen, JD, Stanford ’85Luke Hansen, UndergraduateAndrew Baker, GSBShoshana Vasserman, GSBAndrew Babbitt, GSBAndrew Baker, GSBProf. Mohammad Akbarpour, GSBShreya Kankanhalli, GSBEdward Watts, GSBProf. Juliane Begenau, GSBJonathan Hess, GSBDr Michael Zhang, GSB MBA1Mandeep Arora, MSXProf. Claudia Robles-Garcia, GSBXu Lu, GSBMr. Joshua Yang, GSB, Johns Hopkins SOMJoe FiannacaMarco Lorenzon, Economics, MS&EBrian White, MathematicsJamie Daves, GSB 2001Sander Breur, SLACKelly McFarlane, GSB, Harvard Medical SchoolProf. Baba Shiv, GSBMichele Spitzer, GSB ’21Dinsh Guzdar, GSBChristian Manchester, GSBZachry Wang, GSBAndrew Scherer, MichiganCourtney Payne, GSBFin O’Hara, GSBProf. Rebecca Lester, GSBJane Leu, GSBLaura Ugokwe, Stanford GSB StaffJoanna Augenbergs, GSB StaffRon Lerma, GSBOlivia Sayvetz, GSBBina Luo, GSB ’20Mike Hochleutner, GSBJack Reidy, StaffSorel Denholtz, Stanford GSBMonica Brandt, Stanford StaffShalini Bhatia, Stanford GSB StaffDave Weinstein, GSB Executive EducationRajiv Gupta, InnoCreate GlobalJoan Grubb, Stanford GSBTim Brown, GSB ’20Caitlin Johnston,GSBJenna Garden, ’20 and GSB staffSri Venkatachari, StudentAnna Cole, MS CEE ’20Tim Hoag, GSB MBA1Sami Tellatin, MBA ’20Pooja Bhardwaj, GSBDavina Drabkin, GSB ’03Cecilia Goytisolo O’Reilly, GSB ’03Jacob Conway, EconomicsBarrie Grinberg, GSB ’21Lamiaa Laurene Daif, GSB, MSxJuan Carlos Alonso, MBA ’03Lisa Radloff, GSB – DSProf Tsachy Weissman, EEDr. Joshua Adeoye, Stanford GSBHannah Barrett, GSB ’20Lauren Boros, GSB, MSx 2020Gelila Bekele, GSB MBA ’21Robin Severns, Stanford Healthcare, Design and Construction\n\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and  letters to the editor.
