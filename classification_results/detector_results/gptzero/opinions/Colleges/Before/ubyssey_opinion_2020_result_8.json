The university’s funding comes in large part from the province. In the 2019/20 fiscal year, the university received$657 million in provincial government grants, making up around 30 per cent of its total operating revenue of more than $2 billion.\nThat gives the government a considerable amount of control over UBC and as a result, your university experience.\nAnd especially in this election, who’s in government matters. The ruling party will have control over the future pandemic response and recovery. The pandemic has impacted us all, and while we’ve moved past the idea of itimpacting everyone equally, how the government addresses the pandemic has the potential to impact the next years, even the next decade of life in BC.\nOn top of the simple pandemic response plan, this government also has the responsibility to finally address some long-standing issues in BC that the pandemic has made impossible to ignore.\nSince the pandemic began,244 peoplehave died of COVID-19. An additional 1,068 peoplehave diedbetween January and September from another public health emergency: the opioid crisis, which has taken more lives in these past nine months than in all of 2019. The government you elect will be the one to decide how to handle the opioid crisis going forward.\nEven before the pandemic, the past year has been one of activism.\nProtests that erupted in solidarity with Wet’suwet’en at the Unist’ot’en camp in northern BC and hereon campus, making it clear that the construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline finds itself at odds with the Indigenous right to self-governance.\nThousands gatheredin the plaza outside the Nest as part of global climate strikes, calling for action from politicians to protect our water and land for generations to come.\nUBC studentsjoined demonstrationsat the Vancouver Art Gallery downtown after the deaths of George Floyd and other Black lives at the hands of police — cases of systemic racism that society in both the United States and Canada is rooted in.\nOur generation has a voice. And it’s a strong one.\nThe next government will determine the path we take as a province to fight the opioid crisis, reconcile past and present wrongs done to Indigenous peoples, tackle the climate crisis and pursue an anti-racist future. With this election, we can influence where that path goes.\nYes, it’s a pandemic. Yes, that might make it harder to vote. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. If you want to go to the polls on election day, you can find your polling station on theElections BC website. If you want to vote in advance, you can do so from October 15 to October 21. If you’re nervous about voting in person, you can request a mail-in ballotonlineuntil October 17.\nYour vote matters, now more than ever.\nWant to learn more about the election?
