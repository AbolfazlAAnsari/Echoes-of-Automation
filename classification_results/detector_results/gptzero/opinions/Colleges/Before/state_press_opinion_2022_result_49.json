            "inputText": "Given the urgency with which we must act to avoid catastrophes, we need elected leaders who look to the future and who are willing to act now.\nThe Southwest is ground zero for some of the most pressing issues threatening our way of life. We know from personal experience, as well asdataover time, that Arizona and its neighboring states are getting drier and hotter. We are witnessing significantcutsin the Colorado River water supply, as well as heat waves, droughts and wildfires with increasing strength and frequency.\nAs is the case around the world, those who are the most vulnerable are impacted the most. In Arizona, people who can't afford air conditioning or proper housing are dying in growing numbers from heat-related causes.\nWe cannot prepare for the future without addressing these long-term threats. It would be my hope that incoming elected officials will make global change one of the centerpieces of their legislative action.\nEarth's systems, like politics, are not static. We live in a dynamic system that is changing rapidly. The speed and scale of change means that we require different political action from what was needed in the past.\nWe have pushed the life-supporting systems of our planet past their limits, and those effects are directly putting the people in the Southwest at risk. We must all work together — politicians, civil servants, researchers and citizens — to identify and enact the best policies that can adapt to multiple, interdependent stressors.\nGiven the urgency with which we must act to avoid moving from crises to catastrophes, we need elected leaders who look to the future and are willing to act now.\nEdited by Sadie Buggle, Piper Hansen, Greta Forslund and Luke Chatham.\nPeter Schlosser is the vice president and vice provost of the Global Futures Initiative at ASU.
