We’re beyond thrilled and humbled to further The Daily’s work of informing the campus community with honest and impactful journalism as we continue to adjust to life back at Stanford.\nDespite a return to “normal” life on campus, COVID-19 still looms. The past few months have been marked by uncertainty, as together we’ve navigated remote classes and case spikes on campus. At The Daily, our goal remains keeping you informed through this challenging time: from answering yourburningquestionstosharingstudents’experiences.\nAnd of course, we’ll continue to answer the more light-hearted inquiries that pique our curiosity, fromwhy Stanford math professorsstill use chalk towhy Axess crashesduring course enrollment orwhy there are so manyabandoned bikes on campus.\nWe recognize that impactful, accessible journalism extends beyond clear and intentional language. We are excited to work on expanding The Daily’s multimedia offerings, from producing a wider range of podcast and video content to publishing photo galleries and incorporating creative graphics. We are incredibly fortunate to work with a talented team of multimedia staffers to deliver 21st-century digital storytelling to our audience, and we are excited to see what we can accomplish together.\nThough The Daily is focused on serving the surrounding community, we are also taking time to look inward and evaluate our own community. Through initiatives in collaboration with our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) team, we look forward to continuing to build a diverse staff that accurately reflects the communities we serve. We’ll be considering the results of our Vol. 260demographics surveyand challenging ourselves to build a more inclusive team. Through the Equity Project, we are excited to continue to produce content with an equity lens that reflects the interests and needs of all communities. We also recognize that valuable journalism begins with a supportive and respectful work environment, and we are striving to foster this atmosphere as we lead The Daily’s team into the new volume.\nWe want to hear from you. Through Vol. 260’s“100 people in 100 days” initiative,we got to hear directly from you to better understand our community and learn what we’re doing well, and where we can continue to grow. And this volume we want to continue listening: submit atip,an articleorconsider joining us.\nAnd here’s a bit more about us.\nEmma is the Vol. 261 editor-in-chief.
