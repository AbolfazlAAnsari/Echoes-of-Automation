            "inputText": "Over the past weekend, a small group of concerned faculty met on Zoom with student organizers. By Monday we had composed and posted a letter to the administration for other faculty to sign. Within 24 hours we had gathered nearly 100 signatures from schools and departments across campus.The petition will remain openuntil Stanford agrees to pay continuation. It is Stanford who decides what will happen next, not the contractor that Stanford employs. The letter is below.\nWe write as concerned members of the Stanford faculty. While we understand that the COVID-19 pandemic has produced an unprecedented crisis, causing a substantial financial impact on Stanford’s operating budget and endowment, we are troubled by Stanford’s decision to help lessen that impact by asking its contractor, UG2, to cut costs, leading the company to lay off over a hundred subcontracted workers.\nWe commend Stanford for its proactive stance throughout this crisis, which demonstrates the unique leadership role that Stanford plays nationally and globally. Stanford also has the opportunity to make a difference by reaffirming higher educational institutions’ commitment to supporting the most vulnerable members of our respective communities, particularly in times of crisis.\nStanford rightly prides itself in design and innovation, yet some aspects of its response to this crisis embrace the reproduction of existing, inequitable labor hierarchies rather than the creation of new support systems that reflect our interdependence. We have taken the lead in some ways (such as recognizing the magnitude of the public health threat and closing campus early), while appearing to fall behind in other ways, in this instance by allowing workers to be laid off and neglecting to adequately recognize, in meaningful and material ways, the people whose labor is fundamental to sustaining the university.\nWe are puzzled that Stanford is unwilling to do what several of our peer institutions —Harvard,MIT,University of Chicago,University of PennsylvaniaandDuke— have done, namely to retain and pay their subcontracted workers through the end of the academic year, even as they are unable to work due to on-campus changes related to COVID-19.Instead, Stanford has committed to paying only its directly hired service workers through April 15.We are severely disappointed at Stanford in this regard, and we wish to add our voices to many others to urge Stanford to reconsider this action, and to do the right thing.\nAs much as we note with pride the essential work our scientific and medical communities have contributed to the battle against the virus, we must never forget who cleans the labs and the buildings where we conduct our research, who grooms the grounds and who serves our food.\nWe commend the president and the provost for taking a significant cut in pay; this is a true act of leadership. We commend our undergraduate students who through their own initiative and their energyhave raised more than $230,000 to provide emergency funds for laid off workersandgathered over 2,000 signatures on a petitionin support of pay continuation. Our students have made extraordinary efforts to support laid off workers while adjusting to numerous disruptions and managing countless concerns and uncertainties. It strikes us as inequitable that undergraduates would carry this weight as well.\nThus, in the spirit of sharing the burden, we pledge to donate each month a portion of our salaries to those workers who have been laid off. We are posting our donations tothis GoFundMe.\nDespite these sacrifices and donations, this leaves a large amount still lacking.  Therefore, we call upon Stanford to commit to pay continuance for all service workers through spring quarter.\nAs Margaret Levi, director of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS) at Stanford, professor of political science, and senior fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment,writes:\n“We are in a community of fate that COVID-19 has created. Our destinies are now clearly entwined as we join together to fight this virus and protect ourselves and our societies. The pandemic makes us aware of our reliance on and obligations to a wide network extending beyond family, friends, and neighbors to all those who contribute to our health care, supply chains, education of our children, etc. Even the invisible workers are becoming visible: the grocery clerks, the cleaners, the sanitation personnel who make it possible to survive and thrive. Such a community of fate can cut across polarization and become the basis of mobilization for the policies to promote flourishing.”\nWorkers at Stanford are cherished members of our community. We must be as committed to supporting them as they have been to supporting us.\nSigned,\nRush Rehm, Professor of Classics, and Theater and Performance StudiesJonathan Rosa, Associate Professor of Education and, by courtesy, Anthropology and LinguisticsDavid Palumbo-Liu, Louise Hewlett Nixon Professor and Professor of Comparative Literature, and, by courtesy, EnglishTodd Davies, Associate Director and Lecturer, Symbolic Systems ProgramAllyson Hobbs, Associate Professor of History and Director of African & African American StudiesAdrian Daub, Professor of German Studies and Comparative LiteratureAdam J Banks, Professor, Graduate School of EducationAmado M Padilla, Professor Graduate School of EducationRose Salseda, Assistant Professor, Art & Art HistoryHakeem Jefferson, Assistant Professor of Political ScienceAlexander Key, Associate Professor of Comparative LiteratureAna Minian, Associate Professor of HistoryDuana Fullwiley, Associate Professor of AnthropologyTom Mullaney, Professor of HistorySarah Levine, Assistant Professor, Graduate School of EducationRamon Saldivar, Professor of English & Comparative LiteratureCecile Alduy,  Professor, French and Italian Department; Chair, DLCLSylvia Yanagisako, Edward Clark Crossett Professor of Humanistic Studies, Professor of AnthropologyLaura Wittman, Associate Professor, dept. of French and ItalianJeffrey Koseff, Professor of Civil and Environmental EngineeringZephyr Frank, Professor of HistoryCharles Lee, Professor of Accounting, Graduate School of BusinessPaula Moya, Professor of EnglishBarbara Voss,  Associate Professor of AnthropologyGuadalupe Valdes, Bonnie Katz Tenenbaum Professor of EducationSean Follmer, Assistant Professor of Mechanical EngineeringJulia Salzman, Assistant Professor, Department of Biochemistry and of Biomedical Data ScienceRoy Pea, David Jacks Professor of Education and Learning Sciences,Usha Iyer, Asst Professor, Art and Art HistoryDavid Tse, Professor of Electrical EngineeringPaul Kiparsky, Professor of LinguisticsKabir Tambar, Associate Professor, AnthropologyPatricia Alessandrini, Assistant Professor, Department of Music, Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA)Judith Frydman, Donald Kennedy Chair in the School of Humanities and Sciences and Professor of GeneticsJody Maxmin, Associate Professor of Art History & ClassicsChris Ré, Associate Professor of Computer ScienceKarla Oeler, Associate Professor (Teaching) of Film and Media StudiesShripad Tuljapurkar, Professor of BiologyGail Wight, Professor, Dept. of Art & Art HistoryDan Jurafsky, Professor, Linguistics and Computer Science, Chair LinguisticsRuss B Altman, Professor, Bioengineering, Genetics, MedicinePenelope Eckert, Professor of LinguisticsAnshul Kundaje, Assistant Professor, Genetics, Computer ScienceJessica Negrette, Academic Affairs, School of MedicineMaria Araceli Ruiz-Primo, Associate Professor, Graduate School of EducationLauri Karttunen, Adjunct Professor of LinguisticsGuillermo Solano-Flores, Professor of Education, Graduate School of EducationMehran Sahami, Professor (Teaching) of Computer ScienceCleo Condoravdi, Professor, Department of LinguisticsScott Bukatman, Professor, Art and Art History, Stanford UJeanne Merino, Lecture and Director, Stanford Law SchoolChristopher Manning,  Professor, Linguistics and Computer ScienceJames Ferguson, Susan S. and William H.
