While Gupta had a few ideas on how to further utilize existing channels for engagement such as social media and listservs, Unegbu took on a critical view of the issue and emphasized the need to plan more events where students can learn about SA committees, have one-on-one conversations with senators from across campus and encourage general student attendance in retreats.\nThat being said, we are wary of Unegbu’s limited experience not just with the SA but the campus in general, being only a freshman.

It is important that the IVP understands the issues that concern all of the campus, and Unegbu has mostly had exposure to the concerns of new students through her position as Hanszen College NSR.\nAlthough Gupta has more years of experience in the SA, currently serving as chief of staff, her ideas were not as thought out and novel as Unegbu’s. There is much that could be changed within the SA, and we believe that Unegbu is most poised to recognize these issues and seek out innovative solutions to persisting problems.\nEditor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Savannah Kuchar, Ben Baker-Katz, Nayeli Shad, Talha Arif, Morgan Gage, Daniel Schrager and Brandon Chen.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
