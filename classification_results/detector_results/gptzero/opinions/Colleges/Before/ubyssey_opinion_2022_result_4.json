This can be equivalent to eight to ten sessions, depending on your therapist’s session rate.\nBefore your first session, you need to ensure your practitioner has licensing covered by Pacific Blue Cross.\nStudentCare outlines the following positions are coverable: “licensed psychologist, registered clinical counsellor, licensed psychological associate registered with the College of Psychologists of British Columbia, or have a Master’s degree in Social Work.” These will look something like ‘PhD,’ ‘R.C.C.,’ ‘L.P.A.’ or ‘M.S.W.,’ respectively, next to the therapist’s name in the listing.\nOnce you’ve checked this, you know that you can be reimbursed for mental health services. Reimbursement for eligible mental health services is typically processed through an online claim submission.\nHere’s the general process:\nHere’s a step-by-step of how to submit a claim:\nPayment and claiming are just one component of accessing private mental health services. There’s also picking a therapist, learning what kind of therapy is best for you and of course, going to therapy. This guide is a snapshot into what accessing mental health services looks like as a student.\nWishing you the best in your mental health journey.\nThe authors of this column are not mental health professionals. If you need additional support, please contact Student Health Services, the Sexual Assault Support Centre and/or the Wellness Centre.
