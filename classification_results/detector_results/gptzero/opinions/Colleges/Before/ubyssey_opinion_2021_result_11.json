At the time of writing this article, there is not a country in the world withoutthe aforementioned advisorylevied upon it by the Government of Canada — therefore, cancellation of Go Global Winter 2022 exchanges is a foregone conclusion.\nIn communications to students currently enrolled in exchange programs for Winter 2022, UBC cites the advisory to “avoid non-essential travel” as the sole reason for the previous and probable upcoming cancellations.\nHowever, as theGovernment of Canada websitestates, “it is up to you to decide what “non-essential travel” means, based on family or business requirements, knowledge of or familiarity with a country, territory or region, and other factors.” Given the definition of the advisory, and the generalsupport for study abroad programsfrom the Government of Canada in its belief that “both countries will be enriched,” it is very difficult to see why UBC is so adamant in denying its students the opportunity to go abroad.\nThis current fall semester has seen the arrival of exchange students from around the world at UBC, whileUBC studentsindual degree programsand theGlobal Supply Chain and Logistics Managementjoint exchange initiative have departed to international destinations.\nIn addition to the UBC students outside of the traditional Go Global pipeline going abroad this fall and winter, other Canadian universities includingQueen’sand theUniversity of Victoriahave proceeded with their study abroad programs without controversy.Westernand its affiliate universities have also taken a more appropriate response, allowing students to complete anauthorization processwherein they must demonstrate sound planning for their academics, travel and safety to their advisors. If successful, students are cleared to go abroad.\nUniversities slated to host UBC students for the winter term are processing exchange procedures as normal, and it remains possible for Canadian students to obtaintravel and study visas.\nThe vast majority of UBC students have declared themselves to befully vaccinated, and the student population falls into thelowest COVID-19 risk category(found on page 20). The onus should be placed on the student to decide whether or not it is in their best interest to pursue their exchange, but the only party blocking this decision-making process is UBC.\nWhen COVID-19 shut the world down, UBC and every other university were forced into making important decisions in order to protect the health of students, faculty, and greater communities. Somewhere along the line, a blanket ‘no’ has become a prevailing force in administrative decision-making and a generalized excuse to not work with students on finding solutions.\nThe pandemic has had adisproportionate impacton young adults and the educational experience and UBC should not continue to pile on the disappointments. We are at the point where study abroad programs are possible: UBC and Go Global need to provide students with the opportunity to pursue them.\nIvan Schmelke-Haagenson is a fourth-year honours student at Sauder and spent the last two years as an editor for UBC’s New Business Review.\nShare this articlecopied!\nSam Friesenauthor\nIvan Schmelke-Haagensonauthor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
