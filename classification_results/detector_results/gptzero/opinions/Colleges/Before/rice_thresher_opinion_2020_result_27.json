            "inputText": "ByMolly Wancewicz9/15/20 9:15pm\nEditor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors.\nRecently, I was eating dinner outdoors when I saw a classmate throw a plastic Gatorade bottle in the trash can. I mentioned it, and she told me that she wasn’t recycling because there was still Gatorade in the bottle. When I suggested that she empty and rinse out the bottle to recycle it, she just waved her hand and laughed. I returned to my room, crushed — that same morning, my family in California’s Bay Area had awoken to another day of hazardous smoke and “snowing” ash from three nearby wildfires, and some of the sites of my childhood memories had burned to the ground. Studies have shown that the severity of California’s wildfires, which recently brought apocalypticorange skiesto my hometown, is inextricablylinkedto human-caused climate change. These wildfires should serve as a reminder that we need to take climate change more seriously, which entails adjusting our daily behaviors as well as pushing for large-scale reform.\nI know that in the scheme of things, my classmate’s plastic bottle has a relatively tiny impact on the environment, but plastic wastedoes contributeto climate change. What’s more, this interaction reminded me of countless experiences of Rice students’ disregard for the environment. For example, when I remained on campus for the last part of the spring semester, the servery provided beverages in plastic bottles and aluminum cans, and many of the students remaining at Brown College disposed of empty cans and bottles in the garbage cans. Using GroupMe and paper signs, I begged the remaining on-campus students to recycle, but many didn’t, and twice a day I would don gloves and remove all the recyclables from the trash can. Recycling on campus is an extremely simple task, and while recycling systems areflawedand recycling alone is not enough to address climate change, refusing to do something so easy shows disrespect to those who are impacted by climate change.\nTo me, these actions are especially devastating in the context of Rice and Houston. The Rice career fair is rife with oil and gas companies, even though the industry is aleading contributorto greenhouse gas emissions and any oil and gas development isfundamentally irreconcilablewith combating climate change. Our congressman, Dan Crenshaw, hasvotedto support President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 Paris Agreement and to deny funding and regulatory power to the Environmental Protection Agency.\nIf my experience with climate change doesn’t move you, that’s okay. After all, I’m very lucky — though my family lives just 1.5 miles from the base of the nearest forested hill, we’ve never had to evacuate. But many people I know have, and some have lost their homes. Other Californians have lost their lives to wildfires —over 100 in 2018 alone. California is far from the only state affected: wildfires are burningacross the west, the Southeast and East Coast faceincreasingly destructivehurricanes, and the Southwest is experiencingextreme heat waves and droughts.Around the world, sea levels are rising, temperatures are skyrocketing and severe weather events are multiplying. Climate change also threatens the most vulnerable groups, with low-income communities, racial and ethnic minorities and womenmore severely affected.\nIt’s also important to note that corporations, not people,contribute the mostto climate change, and that encouragement of individual sustainability can be a tacticused by polluting companiesto evade responsibility. To that, I have two answers — yes, but and yes, and.\nFirst, yes, but individual lifestyle changes like recycling, biking instead of driving or reducing your meat and dairy consumption stillmake a difference. For instance, just a 1 percent increase in the U.S. recycling rate would approximate the removal of1.56 million carsfrom the road. One person switching to a vegetarian dietpreventsabout 1.35 metric tons of carbon emissions every year. Making such changes also shows that you care about the world you live in, about your classmates and your community and about the populations you hope to serve one day if you aim to become a health professional or political figure, as many Rice students do.\nSecond, yes, and it is our responsibility to move beyond individual lifestyle changes and work to enact systemic change. For instance, devote some time this semester to organizing, whether that takes the form of volunteering for a campaign, blockwalking or protesting. At the very least, if you’re eligible, do the bare minimum and vote for all offices, from local to federal this November.\nBy many experts’accounts, the world has just a decade to act before the horrific effects of climate change become irreversible, so I implore every member of the Rice community: Take responsibility for your individual actions and devote some time to advocating for large-scale change. Together, these actions could avert a climate catastrophe.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
