But for us maple-tinged universities, it’s smack dab in the middle of examandmoving season. What’s more, they had to put it right next toanother 'green' holiday. How do they expect us to have such stamina?\nAll jokes aside, the Earth has done so much to support us, and the steps we take to care for our planet can also help us grow more connected with our community. Here are some sustainability and climate justice efforts you can take part in at UBC this summer.\nAfter months of design, trial and error, Sustaingineering UBC is bringingits tiny home projectto campus! The prototype looks to incorporate elements such as rainwater harvesting, a solar-powered water pump anda small-scale wind turbine.\nStudents who are interested in participating but aren’t yet on the team are encouraged to contactsustaingineering@gmail.comto check for availability. Recruitment for the fall term will begin on Imagine Day.\nStudent advocacy doesn’t stop in the summer. Climate Justice UBC (CJUBC) is working to gather student pressure on RBC to divest from fossil fuels, given their status as thelargest fossil-fuel financier in Canadaandon-campus presencewithin the Nest. The club is also gearing up for itsreinvestmentcampaign withDivest UVicandSFU350to encourage universities divesting from fossil fuels to fund efforts that promote “social, economic and environmental wellbeing” within their communities.\nStudents who are interested in attending informational meetings or participating in advocacy campaigns are encouraged to follow CJUBC onInstagram,TwitterandFacebook, and reach out to the coordinators atclimatejusticeubc@gmail.com.\nSprouts is hosting its first summer mutual aid project! Our local volunteer-run food co-op is leading ameal-distribution projectproviding fresh food to folks in the Downtown Eastside. Volunteers can help prepare food in the Sprouts kitchen or drive and distribute meals. No prior experience required, commitment is once weekly for a calendar month. To find out more about volunteering for Sprouts, check out itsInstagrampage.\nSprouts has also begun hosting a community fridge, freezer and pantry in the lower level of the Life Building. Volunteers will replenish the fridge from time to time with food donated by local grocery stores and bakeries, so take what you need and pitch in when you can! (Community members are reminded to review thedonation guidelinesprior to donating and to avoid leaving opened, home-cooked or expired food in the community fridge.)\nIf you are a guest to xʷməθkʷəy̓əm, it’s worth learning about the community and lands that surround us. Xʷc̓ic̓əsəm — hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ for “the place where we grow” — invites individuals to engage with Indigenous understandings of healing and share traditional plant knowledge and Indigenous food sovereignty practices. Medicinal plants such as sage and tobacco grow alongside native food crops from a diverse array of Indigenous communities.\nPlanting and harvesting opportunities are posted to the garden’sInstagram pageas they become available. Volunteers are encouraged to arrive on-time for the start of the session to best settle into the space before working in the garden.\nGet your hands dirty, learn and support your community while you’re at it.
