The provision of certain funded and remote summer research assistantshipsexclusivelyto students with significant aid, for example, offers academic opportunities that may have presented a financial barrier in the past. The offering of financial aid for summer courses this year also opens the playing field to those unable to pay full tuition — which, according to financial aidstatistics, is a significant portion of students. By promoting these kinds of opportunities, Harvard may effectively ensure an online semester that doesn’t sacrifice academic or financial enrichment.\r\nThe argument that the University should postpone the semester because online learning would disadvantage students with difficult home environments is fallacious. Such an action would make it difficult for students to catch up academically — and most importantly, the same amount of time would be spent off-campus anyways. Instead of pursuing this vague, ill-defined course, effectively preparing for an online semester would allow for a much better experience than this prior spring. Students already have the option to postpone the continuation of their education; those who desire to continue learning should have the option to do so too. And a mandatory postponement would impact not just students but potentially the livelihoods of faculty and staff.\r\nNobody knows what life is going to look like post-COVID-19. Whether social distancing becomes a seasonal necessity, or online and in-person learning become permanently intertwined (asExtension Schoolstudents have already learned to navigate), or colleges indefinitely reinforce distancing measures, everyone must consider how to personally adapt. By postponing the coming semester, Harvard would only be delaying the inevitable, instead of learning how best to work within its boundaries.\r\nHarvard is only as good as the people within it, and virtual instruction is only as good as we allow it to be. Providing deans and faculty enough preparation time will doubtlessly allow for a more recognizably transformative experience, even if online. While we understand that virtual instruction is hardly comparable to in-person instruction, Harvard can and should prepare for a more equalizing online semester with stronger academic and extracurricular opportunities, so that it is enriching as it has the potential to be. And in turn, students should be understanding of the necessary changes that accompany the uncertainties of unprecedented situations.\r\nNoah D.
