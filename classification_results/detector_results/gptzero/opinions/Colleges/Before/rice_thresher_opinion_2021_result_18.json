The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors.\nI am absolutely terrified about the state of abortion access in Texas and the U.S. after thepassage of S.B. 8.When I came to Rice, I did not think that it would mean giving up some of my fundamental rights. I am a woman, and while I have never had an abortion I know that I might get pregnant at some point in my life and that it might not be my choice. It is a fear and a fact that every person with a uterus must live with. Even if I do get pregnant exactly when I want to and how I want to, anything could happen. In the best-case scenario, pregnancy is a nine-month-longphysicalandpsychologicalordeal where your body and mind shift in ways that are totally out of your control, culminating in hours ofunimaginable pain, and followed by months (or years) of dealing with thephysical aftermath, all while caring for a child that relies on your traumatized body for nutrients at all hours of the day and night. And that’s if everything goes right. Abortion must be an option, as any pregnancy is too dangerous to force on someone.\nOn top of that, there are so many things that can happen along the way. You may get into an accident that will force your doctors to choose between protecting you or the fetus. Don’t be fooled into thinking that they will choose you. As soon as a person gets pregnant, the world forgets their humanity, putting an unborn child over a living, breathing human woman. Doctors oftenprioritize fetal healthover that of the pregnant person in trauma scenarios, despite that going against medical guidelines. Additionally, many simply do not know how toproperly diagnosean injured pregnant patient. Even everyday care becomes complicated, as to protect the fetus pregnant people are advised not to use many simple treatments, fromcold medicine to anti-anxiety pills. And pregnancy itself has myriad possible complications that range fromunpleasant to deadly(especially in the U.S., where the maternal mortality rate is theworst among industrialized countries). You may get pregnant and then find out that your body simply cannot survive carrying a child or that you need lifesaving treatment that cannot be administered during pregnancy. For these people, to deny them abortion access is to deny them necessary healthcare. Just because our bodies are capable of giving birth, that does not make it acceptable to force us to complete a pregnancy. Remember, this can all happen even if you wanted to get pregnant.\nUnfortunately, there are all too many people who do not get that choice. There are over450,000victims of rape and sexual assault in the United States every year, and about30,000of them will become pregnant as a result of that rape. Additionally, everythree secondssomeone in the U.S. is assaulted by a partner. This abuse oftenstarts or worsensduring pregnancy, which may itself be a result of the abuse. Pregnant women who have experienced domestic violence are more likely to havesuicidal ideationsthan other pregnant women, who are in turn almost twice as likely to be suicidal as the general population. All of the trauma and fear surrounding every pregnancy applies to these people as well, but it is compounded by the daily reminder of the violent loss of their bodily autonomy.\nSo you should care that the right to choose is disappearing in Texas and show it by protesting this law and pushing for it to be overturned. Care for the woman who was raped by her abusive husband. Care for the person who desperately wanted a baby but also desperately wants to survive their cancer diagnosis. Care for the teenage girl who fell in love but just isn’t ready to be a mom. Care for your fellow students who are scared. Care for me, a human being, who has no idea what is going to happen but knows that she has the right to make the best choice for herself.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
