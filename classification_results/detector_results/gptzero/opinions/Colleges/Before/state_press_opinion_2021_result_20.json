            "inputText": "\"One worry is that if people believe that the election system is unfair, they will be less likely to vote.\" Illustration published on Thursday, April 30, 2020.\nAs Maricopa County's ballotaudit continues, conspiracy theories of an unfair election are being fueled.Arizonais not only lowering voter trust, and potentially affecting outcomes for future elections by doing this, but they are also encouraging other states to follow in their footsteps, to lead these biased audits taking place due to unfounded worries.\nThe audit began on April 23 after the Arizona Senate was granted custody of Maricopa County's 2.1 million ballots to search for any trace of fraud. One could argue that these complaints are connected to the \"Stop the Steal\" movement, which promotes a conspiracy theory that argues the election was somehow fraudulent.\nThis theory continues to be believed by some, even though the ballots were counted multiple times. The mostextreme membersof the conservative party, including groups like the Proud Boys, have voiced support, hoping the audit could help turn Arizona's 11 electoral votes from President Joe Biden to former President Donald Trump.\nThe audit is being done by the private Florida-based technology companyCyber Ninjas, which has received backlash the past few months for its credibility since it has never conducted an audit. Even some Republicans, including ASU College Republicans President Joe Pitts, said there areissueswith how the audit is being handled.\n\"I think there are genuine questions about the validity of the election that can't be pushed to the side,\" said Pitts, a junior studying management. \"The election wasn't rigged, but you can't ignore these people. You need to answer these questions.\"\nPitts sided with the reality that even if this audit finds Trump received more votes over Biden in Maricopa County, it won't change the outcome of the results, since 270 electoral votes would be needed.Biden won 306electoral votes, and Trump won 232. Biden still would have won even without Arizona's 11 votes.\nArizona’s audit has also encouraged other battleground states, includingPennsylvania, to reevaluate their own elections. While there is nothing wrong with ensuring that a voting system is secure, it makes no sense for these investigations to be partisan. Trump, however, had been speaking of the idea of a rigged election before it took place, planting the seeds of doubt in the minds of his supporters.\nFollowing Trump's \"stolen election\" rhetoric,new voting billsin state legislatures across the nation have been appearing, including in Arizona.\nOne bill, which was signed into law by Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, requires that voters who signed up for what was formally known as thepermanent early voting listmust mail in their ballots in both the primary and general election for two consecutive election cycles in order to remain on the list. If not, they will not receive an early mail-in ballot in the following election.\nWhile proponents for the new law say it will purge non-active voters, progressive activists argue this is just one more hurdle for voters who may innocently miss voting in some elections.\n\"You would think that with record turnout and more people voting that the Arizona Senate would want to make it easier to vote, but they're making it harder,\" said ASU Young Democrats President Cameron Adams, a senior studying global studies.\nOne worry is that if people believe that the election system is unfair, they will be less likely to vote. According to a 2020Pew Research Center poll,just under half of surveyed voters between the ages of 18-29 feel very confident in the current vote count if they voted in person, and the percentage is even smaller for those who voted by mail.\nASU Tempe students voted at an11% higher ratein the 2016 general election compared to 2012's, and it is an energy that must be sustained. This may not be possible if students begin to doubt the power of their ballot. This may be the result of the election audit.\nReach the columnist athtenore@asu.eduor follow@haleyyhmton Twitter.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
