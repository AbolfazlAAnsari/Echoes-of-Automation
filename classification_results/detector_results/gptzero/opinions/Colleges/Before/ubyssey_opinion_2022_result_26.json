Well, we have to do something about it.\nUnwreck the BeachisThe Ubyssey’s new sustainability column, written by UBC students, for UBC students. Our columnists are passionate about all things environment, from the climate crisis and sustainable food security to cool initiatives and events on campus and intersectionality within climate justice — they’ve got you covered.\nIt’s time toUnwreck the Beach!\nMatt is in his fifth year at UBC majoring in media studies. He explores how social forces shape the way individuals perceive ‘climate change’ and seeks out stories that share why folks care. He has written the gamut from climate finance to university climate policy, but strives to centre justice and student voices within these discussions. Above all, Matt believes in the power of community-driven action, the perspectives of those at the front lines of climate and environmental injustice and the promises of a brighter future rooted in collective care — for our planet and each other.\nForrest is in his fifth year at UBC majoring in anthropology with a minor in political science. He is excited and honoured to cover climate and ecological issues for the UBC community. While there is never a shortage of important and moving stories to tell, the far-reaching and entangled implications of the climate crisis have caused Forrest to agree with Bill McKibben that “Climate change is the single biggest thing humans have done on this planet. The one thing that needs to be bigger is our movement to stop it.”\nJasmine is in her third year at UBC majoring in gender, race sexuality and social justice and minoring in creative writing. She is passionate about intersectional climate justice and is adamant about understanding the climate crisis as interlinked and inextricable from other global and local crises. She understands how overwhelming and frightening the media coverage and academic findings about the climate catastrophe is and hopes to use her reporting as a way to make understanding and combating the climate crisis more accessible and less paralyzing for students. Regardless of whether or not someone actually manages to find ‘Planet B’, she’s quite fond of ‘Planet A’ and would rather spend her time protecting it than abandoning it.\nUnwreck the BeachisThe Ubyssey’s new sustainability column.
