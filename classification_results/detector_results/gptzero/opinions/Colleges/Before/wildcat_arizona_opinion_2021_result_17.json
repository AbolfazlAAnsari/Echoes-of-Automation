            "inputText": "T-shirts made for the Clothesline project in October 2017 at the Pima Purple Domestic Violence Awareness Event, where Domestic abuse survivors can write their stories and or supportive messages on t-shirts for other victims.\nWith theGabby Petito caseand countless other cases in the news surrounding the issue of domestic violence, it is more important now more than ever to ensure that not only the laws regarding domestic violence are tightened, but that the public grasps a deeper understanding of what domestic violence consists of. October serves as domestic violence awareness month, and this year it holds an entirely different weight given theeffectsthe pandemic has had on domestic violence.\nThe boundaries of what defines domestic violence go further than just physical abuse; domestic abuse can include emotional, financial, psychological and sexual abuse as well.Domestic abuseis any type of violence or behavior that harms an individual within an intimate partner relationship.\nThere are various reasons why domestic violence occurs, but the one major reason is to gaincontrolover another in a relationship. The abuser needs control to a point where they feel the need to attain this control through force and abuse. Relationship dynamics can be tricky, but they should never be so one-sided that they are painful.\nDomestic violence on college campuses\nAs college students, the issue of domestic violence can seem far away when in reality the issue of domestic violence affects women ages18-24in catastrophic numbers. The reasons for this vary;70%of people in an abusive relationship do not realize that they are in an abusive relationship. In schools, domestic violence is a topic that is too often avoided or skimmed over because it is seen ascontroversial. Politics control the curriculum, leaving out key items like the warning signs of domestic violence.\nOn top of the avoidance of education on the topic, the college atmosphere, with drinking, stress and newfound independence heightens tension in relationships. The environment of college can have a major effect on unhealthy relationships.\nDangerous relationships that start in college can impact someone for the rest of their life due to the repeated tendency of domestic violence. Being exposed to an unhealthy relationship at such a young agecan impact relationshipsthroughout the rest of your life.\nThere is no mold\nWhile college students are very much impacted by domestic violence, there is no mold that a victim and/or unhealthy relationship falls into. Domestic violence occurs in all types of relationships, regardless of gender identity, sexual preference and race. Acknowledging the vast grip that domestic abuse has on a relationship, regardless of what it looks like, helps those in an unhealthy relationship receive the help they need.\nToo often the signs of domestic violence are only taught to heterosexual women and there needs to be more education for everyone. Thestatisticsshow that straight women are not the only victims so the reach of education needs to broaden to members of the LGBTQ community and beyond.\nRecognize the signs\nBecause as mentioned before, domestic violence does not fit a standard mold; every relationship looks different. If a relationship is starting to get to a point where the power dynamic is stressed, look for other signs of violence or manipulation.\nOne major sign that you or someone you may know is in a dangerous relationship is if a partner purposefully isolates another. This is a red flag. Friendships outside of a relationship are essential and isolation only hurts.\nSignsalso include extreme mood swings, controlling tendencies, being overly possessive and constant ridiculing.\nIt is very important to recognize that domestic violence iscyclical. The abuser goes from the honeymoon phase to abuse to apologizing and then back to the honeymoon. This cycle of manipulation is extremely dangerous.\nGetting help\nIf you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship you can access both local and national resourceshere.\nFollow Payton Toomey onTwitter\n\nPayton Toomey (she/her) is a junior majoring in Journalism and Information Sciences and eSociety.
