            "inputText": "On May 13, Israeli warplanes bombed the home of the Tanani family in the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun,killing38-year-old Ra’fat Tanani, his pregnant 35-year-old wife, Rawiye, and their children, 6-year-old Ismail, 5-year-old Ameer, 4-year-old Adham, and 3-year-old Mohammad.\r\nThis flagrant violation of the international laws of warfare is far from an isolated incident in theworld’s largest open-air prison: the Gaza Strip.\r\nIn its 11-day bombardment, the Israeli military killed at least257 people, including 67 children and multiple families, among them 22 family members of a Harvard Law School alumnus. Wiping out Palestinian families, Amira Hassreports, is not a new Israeli military practice. Back in 2014, Israeli occupation forces killed 142 families in a previous, 51-dayassault on Gaza. Israeli Defense Minister Benjamin Gantz has defended this policy of indiscriminately killing Palestinian civilians,statingon May 18, “no person, area or neighborhood in Gaza is immune.”\r\nAs a Jew whose family survived the Tsarist pogroms and lost relatives in the Nazi Holocaust, I am appalled and outraged at Israel’s effort toethnically cleansethe Palestinian people from their native land, which has beenongoingsince its foundation in1948.\r\nMy great-grandmother did not escape anti-Semitic terror and second-class status so that a Jewish settler-colonial state purporting to speak in her name could establish what leading Israeli human rights organizationB’tselemand evenHuman Rights Watch— otherwise inlockstepwith U.S.foreign policy— describe as an apartheid regime.\r\nIn the face of Israeli apartheid and settler colonialism, Omar Barghoutistressesthere is only one meaningful international response: heeding Palestinian civil society’s call for a global campaign of boycott, divestment, and sanctions modeled on the South African anti-apartheid movement, often referred to asBDS.\r\nHarvard must therefore divest from all Israeli and international companies profiting from Israel’s apartheid regime.\r\nA broad coalition of campus Palestine groups recentlyaffirmedthat “the university maintainsnearly $200 millionin public, direct and indirect investments in companies that are involved in the illegal Israeli settlement enterprise, including companies that provide surveillance, weapons, and bulldozers to demolish Palestinian homes.”\r\nHarvard must not remain on the wrong side of history, like when itrefusedto divest from apartheid South Africa.\r\nBut divestment is not enough. Harvard is home to the Wexner Foundation, which annuallyawardsten scholarships through its Israel Fellowship to “outstanding public sector directors and leaders from Israel” to pursue a Master’s in Public Administration at the Kennedy School.\r\nPast Wexner fellows include more than25Israeli generals and other high-ranking military and police officials. Among them is the Israeli Defense Force’s current chief of general staff, Aviv Kochavi, who is directly responsible for the latest bombardment of Gaza. Kochavi is believed to be one of the 200 to 300 Israeli officialsidentifiedby Tel Aviv as likely to be indicted by the International Criminal Court’s probe into alleged Israeli war crimes committed in Gaza in 2014.\r\nThe Wexner Foundation additionally paid former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak — himselfaccusedof war crimes in connection with Israel’s 2009Operation Cast Leadthat killed over 1400 Palestinians in Gaza —$2.3 millionfor two studies, one of which he did not complete. Barak was a Belfer fellow at HKS in 2016.\r\nThe foundation also runs an “intensive leadership developmentprogramfor leaders in Israel,” which includes four weeks at HKS. The program counts among its alumni senior civilian and military officials, including theheadof budget and planning at Israel’s prison service, which currentlyincarcerates4,650Palestinianspolitical prisoners subject to systematictorture.\r\nHarvard must sever ties with the Wexner Foundation, in addition to ending all research agreements andstudy abroad programswith Israeli universities in line with Palestinian civil society’s call for aninternational academic boycott.\r\nStudy abroad programs discriminate not just against Palestinian Harvard students from the occupied territories —hinderedfrom studying within the Green Line by labyrinthine barriers — but also against anyone who publically supports BDS, who may bebarredentry under the 2017 Anti-Boycott Law.\r\nMeanwhile, Israeli universities are, according to thePalestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, “involved indeveloping weapon systems and military doctrinesdeployed in Israel’s recent war crimes in Lebanon and Gaza,justifying the ongoing colonizationof Palestinian land, rationalizing gradualethnic cleansingof indigenous Palestinians, providing moral justification forextra-judicial killings, systematically discriminating against ‘non-Jewish’ students, andother implicit and explicit violationsof human rights and international law.” Just like in apartheidSouth Africa, it is unconscionable to continue normalizing Israeli academia’s complicity in occupation, settler-colonialism, and apartheid.\r\nFinally, Harvard must use its considerable political clout to pressure President Joe Biden’s administration to suspend all aid to Israel until it ends its occupation of all Arab lands and dismantles itsillegal separation wall, guarantees equal rights for Palestiniancitizenswithin its pre-1967 borders, and recognizes and implements Palestinian refugees’right of returnas pursuant toUN General Assembly Resolution 194.\r\nLet us not forget that Israel cannot maintain its apartheid regime without active U.S. backing, as Israeli Defense Minister Gantz’s recent “emergency”requestfor $1 billion in weapons reveals.\r\nHarvard has a clear choice: It can either stand with Palestinians in their struggle for freedom or it can persist in siding with their oppressors. The physical safety and emotional wellbeing of Palestinian Harvard students, alumni, and their families lie in the balance.\r\nAs Israelcontinuesits settler-colonialassaulton Palestinians between the river and the sea, I echo Rabbi Hillel in asking, “And if not now, when?”\r\nLucas M. Koerner is a second-year doctoral student in Latin American and Caribbean History.\r\nHave a suggestion, question, or concern for The Crimson Editorial Board? Clickhere."
