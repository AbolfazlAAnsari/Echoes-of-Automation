The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness.\nContent warning: This opinion contains references to sexual assault.\nI said I wouldn’t write another opinion for the Thresher after the Facebook comments I received for asubmissionabout Brett Kavanaugh. Kind of feels like shouting into the void, anyway — am I really going to change someone’s mind who doesn’t want to listen to folks who say they’ve been sexually assaulted?\nBut I’m back! Facebook comments be damned!\nJoe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee following Bernie Sanders’endorsement, has beenaccusedof sexual assault. Tara Reade, a former Senate aide who worked in Joe Biden’s Senate office,claimedthat he sexually assaulted her in 1993. The details are disturbing. Reade allegedly told multiple friends and her brother about the incident.\nLucy Flores, a state politician from Nevada, whoclaimedBiden nonconsensually kissed and touched her at a 2014 campaign event,said, “Biden is not just a hugger. Biden very clearly was invading women’s spaces without their consent in a way that made them feel uncomfortable.”Many womenhave come forward saying they felt uncomfortable with his physical contact — kissing, touching, whispering, groping.\nAt Rice, Biden gotless than 15 percent of the votein the March primary — he’s by no means a campus favorite. But we are also a predominantly liberal university. Hillary Clinton won just over85 percent of the votehere in 2016 against Trump. I anticipate similar margins in 2020.\nHumbly, I ask you to recall how you felt when women came forward, accusing then-nominee Donald Trump ofsexually assaultingthem in 2016. To me, it felt disqualifying. But at the very least, it felt deserving of a thorough investigation.\nFour years later, we should not brush off Tara Reade’s accusations as a political smear job. We should believe women not just when it’s politically convenient.\nYou do not owe Biden your vote. Take time to consider the allegations against him. I won’t prescribe how I think you should vote. But I fear that uncritically voting for Biden might secure a future which demarcates just how many sexual assault allegations disqualify a candidate.\nWhat can you do before November? Get involved indown-ballot races. Join chapters of local political organizations. And, please, do not let Tara Reade be forgotten.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
