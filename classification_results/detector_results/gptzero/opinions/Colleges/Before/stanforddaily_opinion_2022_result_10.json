            "inputText": "Earlier this month, Stanford inaugurated theDoerr School of Sustainability, its first new school in over 70 years. Bestowed with $1.7 billion in founding donations, the schoolhas begun hiringover 60 new faculty and will include a sustainability accelerator to scale new climate solutions. Unfortunately, the Doerr School leadership has already begun to squander its potential bycontinuing to accept moneyfrom fossil fuel companies. The costs of these decisions are not to be taken lightly.\nThis July, theStanford Woods Instituteand the student groupScientists Speak Upoffered to host Professor Naomi Oreskes for a full day of events marking the launch of the Doerr School. A Stanford alumna, Oreskes is therecipientof the 2021 Distinguished Alumni Award, Stanford Earth’s highest alumni honor. Her bookMerchants of Doubtand her work exposing climate disinformation havechanged the conversationaround climate change. This was a highly-anticipated event to highlight her work throughout the wider community, simultaneously raising the Doerr School’s profile.\nBut Professor Oreskes rejected the invitation. Instead, she will be giving astudent-organized talkon why she declined this speaking invitation from her alma mater.\nIn an email declining her invitation to speak at the Doerr School, which one of the authors of this article received, Oreskes cited her research on how funding shapes “not only the research agenda, but even how we conceptualize the natural world that we study.” She doesn’t “feel comfortable participating in activities marking the launch of the new Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability” because the schoolaccepts fossil fuel money. Oreskes continued, “I think the evidence is clear, and I wouldn’t be me if I didn’t stand by the evidence.”\nOreskes is not alone in her reservations. We have argued in ourprevious op-edsthat fossil fuel funding damages the academic integrity of the Doerr School and delays climate action. Over 800 Stanford affiliates, including Oreskes, signed aletterin May calling on the Doerr School of Sustainability to “decline funding from fossil fuel companies.”\nThe Doerr School of Sustainability is being crafted by a series of decisions. Leaders of the Doerr School chose to accept fossil fuel money, which in turn led Professor Oreskes to decline a speaker invitation. Doerr School leaders then decided to invite aprofessor of petroleum engineeringto be the first quarterly alumni speaker at the school’s department ofEnergy Science and Engineering. This is a demoralizing way for the new school to reveal its values. Happily, students also have decision-making power. Coinciding with the Doerr School-sponsored petroleum engineering talk,Scientists Speak Upand the StanfordCoalition for a True School of Sustainabilitywill be hosting a talk by Professor Oreskes.\nNow the decision is yours.AtnoononNov. 18th, you can attend a talk hosted by the Doerr School about fossil fuel extraction. Or, you can attend a talk organized by students without university support, given by an internationally-regarded historian of science. There, you would learn about how the fossil industry uses universities like Stanford to greenwash their business and undercut climate action, and how we can fight for a vibrant and livable future for everyone. We hope you will join us.
