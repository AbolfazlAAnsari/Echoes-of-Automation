If you’re not living on campus, in Vancouver or even in Canada, if your mind is occupied with the burdens of the last year, the AMS might not even cross your mind.\nBut this year, more than most, you should give a damn.\nStudents have dealt with innumerable losses this year — our jobs, our campus experiences, our mental health. The UBC community will need to build back on a scale like never before.\nWe’ll all be figuring out how to go back to school safely, how to cope with the financial losses from the last year and how to reorient our mindset to a world without a pandemic.\nThis year, you’re voting for UBC’s path out of this mess.\nThe AMS — while it might not seem like it — plays a big role in that transition. The executives of the student society have direct contact with the big decision makers that will affect you, from university admin up to lawmakers on Parliament Hill.\nStudent politicians hold sway over some of the hot button topics students face. Not to mention, you fork overhundreds of dollarsto them in fees annually.\nThis year, AMS execs will deal with issues many students care about. They’ll see discussions over the future of remote invigilation privacy until the UBC–Proctorio contract’slikely end. The AMS and the federal student lobby could make sure that undergrads aren’t left out of future recovery benefits. The Board of Governors representatives will get a seat at the table to set UBC’s budget astuition fees climb ever higher.\nAll of these positions are important. Trust us, we’ve covered every single one of their meetings.\nRead our coverage. Get informed. If there’s one thing we think we can do, it’s AMS elections coverage. We’re shaping up and have covered each candidate thoroughly, whether incumbent or newcomer, strengths and flaws alike.\nIt’s our full-time job to inform you, but it’s up to you to care.\nDespite the challenges of life online, it’s made it easier to stay engaged in the election. It only takes a few moments from your day tovote.\nWe’ve been doing our best to hold the AMS accountable, from theVP external’s conflict of interest investigationtoprivacy issues with CampusBaseto thelack of COVID-19 protocols at AMS events, butThe Ubysseycan only do so much.\nThat’s why you need to vote — to tell your student government that yes, you’re watching.\nCharlotte Alden and Andrew Ha areThe Ubyssey’s news editors.Votingfor AMS elections opens on March 1 and runs until March 5.\nShare this articlecopied!\nCharlotte Aldenauthor\nAndrew Haauthor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
