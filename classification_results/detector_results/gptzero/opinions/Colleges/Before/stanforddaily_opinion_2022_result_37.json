            "inputText": "Imagine: Come this fall, the new Doerr School of Sustainability will welcome its first cohort of students onto the Stanford campus. They will be joining a team of leading scholars, practitioners, and students to advance sustainability solutions at the speed and scale required to address the urgent climate crisis. Transdisciplinary scholarship and a commitment to environmental justice will be embedded across research projects. Instead of providing research funding to sustain their current business models, fossil fuel companies will look to the School to implement ambitious and credible action plans aligned with the Paris Agreement, entailing immediate, systems-scale investments in clean energy.\nThis is not the School we have today. Following the announcement of the new Sustainability School in May,many have questionedthe School’s commitment to climate and sustainability solutions, with more than780 people signing a petitioncalling on the School to decline future funding from fossil fuel companies.\nThe Coalitionhas demanded atransparent processfor determiningshared values and principlesfor the School, including open public forums and a commitment to establishing strong criteria for industry funding partners. We have not yet heard a response to these demands.\nThe Doerr School must take a more proactive approach to address the concerns that have been raised. Here we summarize why the Doerr School’s relationship with the fossil fuel industry is damaging to our university’s reputation, values, and research integrity, and invite the Stanford community to imagine a different future for the Doerr School.\n1.Our current stance damages Stanford’s reputation.\nIt is clearly detrimental to Stanford’s reputation that a new school focused on climate and sustainability issues isentangled with the fossil fuel industry, which has actively undermined action on climate change fordecadesandcontinues to do so today. While we cannot change the School’shistorical tiesto the industry, our future reputation depends on the choices and decisions we make today, including decisions about phasing out partnerships with companies thatdo not meet the School’s own minimum criteria.\n2.Partnering with fossil fuel companies undermines the School’score values.\nIn addition to itswell-documentedhistoryof disinformation campaigns, the fossil fuel industry has repeatedly engaged in unethical, corrupt, and polluting practices (seePetrobras,Chevron,Shell,BP,ConocoPhillips,ExxonMobil) that have contributed toenvironmental racismanddisproportionate harmtovulnerable communities. Here also lies a clear contradiction to the school’s commitment toenvironmental justice. How can the School claim to take environmental justice seriously, when it does not hold accountable the very actors who have created many of the problems we are trying to solve?\nIf you don’t find the above two arguments convincing, you might say:\nThe logic that our economy depends on fossil fuels — and therefore we should help fossil fuel companies be cleaner — breaks down once we consider the disproportionatelobbyingandmarketingdollars (including aSuper Bowl ad) that our partners have spent tolock in fossil-fuel dependency. It took significant external pressure, a failed project, and rising debt levels for a company likeØrsted to turn away from fossil fuels, not the sudden vision that a fossil fuel-free future was possible.\nThat vision seems far away when theindustry reaped $205 billionin 2021, and stands to gaineven more this yearsince the war in Ukraine (ExxonMobil posting itslargest everquarterly profit of $17.9 billion), with profits going to increase short-termshareholder valueoverinvestments in clean energy.\nAnd, as a research university, we absolutely cannot compromise on the third argument:\n3. Accepting fossil-fuel funding damages our research integrity.\nThe influence of industry funding on research lies not only inwhat gets published, but also in theresearchnotundertaken, the words that remainunspoken, and the questions thatdo notget asked.\nThus far, ourindustry-funded researchspans oil reservoir exploration and management, enhanced recovery of oil, and hydraulic fracturing. Meanwhile, marginal contributions tostorageandcarbon captureresearch remain part of the industry’slatest strategytodelay true climate action.\nDespite public statements supporting the Paris Agreement,none of our partnersare on track to comply with the Paris Agreement and they have not made commensurate investments in renewable energy. Exxon-Mobil invested only0.22% of capital expendituresin low-carbon projects between 2010 and 2018, andBP invested only 2.3%,while quietly divesting all of its solar and wind assets by 2013. Meanwhile, their affiliation with Stanford for a fee of $25k-250k a year plus“additional funding”of undisclosed amounts distracts from the millions spent topromotefossil fuels andoppose climate policies, most recently againstelectric vehiclesandCO2vehicle tailpipe standards.\nNot only do industry partners claim their contributions to Stanford as a contribution to climate action (seeExxonMobil,BMJ reporting), they haveexclusive accessto Stanford faculty and students, while members paying a premium are given permanent seats on a governance board that gets toset research priorities in the Natural Gas Initiative(ExxonMobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips), a direct violation ofStanford’s policy.\nThis is not an equal relationship: Stanford’s fossil fuel industry partners have much more to gain from their affiliation with Stanford, while Stanford becomes a complicit partner indelaying climate actionand incrementalism. If we stay silent as Stanford community members, we are equally complicit.\nAn Alternative Future\nWe believe the case is clear that the status quo is more damaging to Stanford’s reputation, values, and research integrity than an alternative scenario where the Doerr School proactively revamps its industry affiliate programs, establishes clear and stronger criteria for funders and partners, and commits to transparency in its future funding decisions.\nIf we agree on the above, then we can start asking some important questions:\nStanford’s actions and words matter. This fall quarter will be critical for laying the foundation for the Doerr School’s future. We hope that you will join us in building atrue School of Sustainabilitythat we can all be proud of.\nThree quick actions you can undertake now:\nUndersigned on behalf of the Coalition:\nJune Choi (PhD student, Earth System Science)\nBill Gorham (‘74 Stanford alum)\nGus Greenstein (PhD student, EIPER)\nThom Hersbach (Postdoc, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory1)\n1The statements in this article are personal opinions and do not reflect the official views of the US Department of Energy or Stanford University\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and  letters to the editor.
