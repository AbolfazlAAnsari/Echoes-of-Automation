If not, then why would Americans pay taxes? The misunderstanding of those who think many Americans are looking for handouts is a consequence of the intentional ignorance of wealth and inequality in the nation. According to Forbes, the top 1% of U.S. households have15 times more wealth than the bottom 50% of working-class individuals combined.To make matters worse, the top 1% pay less and less in federal income taxes per year,topping out with 37.7% of the total taxes in 2020.\nThis is the effect of Reagan Era tax cuts and the promise of the trickling down of economics, which has very predictably left a huge gap in wealth that may never be recovered. The problem with the general coverage of these outrageous spreads in financial responsibilities is the coverage and government’s interest in making all Americans pay a fair share of their financial responsibilities. Many news organizations and political super PACs, or political action committees, are also funded by the top 1%, so you are much more likely to see a story on socialism over wealth.\nOver the last 20 years, however, there has been an uprising in young, outspoken voices who have been able to get an immediate leg up on politics on the internet. Millennials and Gen Z’ers have been more politically engaged in a way that the “youth” has never been during any time in immediate American history. The result? We are acutely aware of the practicality of pulling ourselves up by the bootstraps, so much so that we know the original purpose of this mantra was to expressa task that is completely impossible. When Boyd tells Texans to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, he is unwittingly acknowledging their plight and the impossible nature of their struggles.\nBoyd himself is now in a similar situation. His ill-conceived blog post likely resulted in the resignation of his position as mayor; however, he claims he had quit previously, and his wife was fired from her job. Perhaps Boyd will take his own advice and figure out a way to pull himself up. For everyone else, working together so they can help lift each other up seems like a safer, more feasible task.\nDashon Love is an Opinion Intern for the winter 2021 quarter.
