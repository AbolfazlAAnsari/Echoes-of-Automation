            "inputText": "A gender-neutral restroom is seen on Tuesday, Aug. 25, 2015, in the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication on the downtown Phoenix campus.\nIn 2015, ASU built a large number ofgender-neutral bathroomsat manydifferent locationsacross all four campuses. This progressive move was a step in the right direction forLGBTQ+students to feel safe in ASU communities.\nThough many people oftenassociatethese restrooms with LGBTQ+ individuals, these bathrooms are used by multiplegroups of people, including transgender or gender non-conforming students who may use these restrooms due to not feeling safe in the men's or women's restrooms. Students withdisabilitiesor families with different gendered children are also included in who may benefit from gender-neutral restrooms.\n\"I think it's important that people respect these spaces so that they can continue to be accessible,\" said Casey Sechler, a lecturer at theT. Denny Sanford School of Social and Family Dynamics. \"These spaces can benefit a wide range of people, not just folks who are gender diverse, but also those with disabilities, or caregivers with young children.\"\nStudents withdisabilitiesmay use these restrooms forphysical needsor may want a more quiet, less crowded area where they are less likely to feel overstimulated.\nBut these restrooms are not always the cleanest. One Reddit post describes students trashing these bathrooms, smoking in them or not respecting the fact that people may be waiting in line to use them next.\n\"I can understand students and faculty who may not have as much time to go off campus for a smoke break and are going to these restrooms for privacy, especially right now during times of increased stress,\" Sechler said.\nBut it's not an excuse to leave it a mess.\nSo, what can ASU do to ensure that students aren't misusing these bathrooms? After all, this isn't exactly an area where you can monitor people since bathrooms are meant to be private.\nOne thing ASU could do is to educate people onwhat these restroomsare used for and who they serve.\nSome possibilities include placing an informative sign outside of the restroom, holding educational presentations or having ASU community members explain the purpose of these restrooms to incoming students.\nOther people simply are not well informed on bathroometiquette, which is also something that we, unfortunately, need to work on insociety.That's why we still see people without a need using thebig bathroom stallswhen others are available.\nIn addition,many people arestill unaccepting, or simply do not care about the transgender, disabled or other marginalized groups of people who use these restrooms. Until we see these types of prejudice becoming less common and accepted, I worry that we will still see these restrooms left dirty and uncared for.\nAlthough trashing these bathrooms may seem like a small thing to most, it may be frustrating to those who have no choice but to use the gender-neutral bathroom. In order to respect the students who use these restrooms, people should treat these spaces with care.\nReach the columnist athtenore@asu.eduor follow@haleyyhmton Twitter.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
