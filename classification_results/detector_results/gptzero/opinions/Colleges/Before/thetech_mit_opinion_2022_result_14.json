            "inputText": "More than 5,000 graduate workers act as MIT’s research engine, accounting for around65% of the research workforce. We meticulously plan experiments that no one in the world has done before, iterate until the results are scientifically sound, and assemble manuscripts that ultimately contribute to the world’s body of knowledge. As the workers closest to our work,weare the experts on what resources we need in the workplace to successfully produce MIT’s world-class innovations and discoveries.A majority of graduate workers have signed our union cards because we fundamentally believe that we deserve a voice in our workplace — and unionizing is the only way to guarantee us legally-enforceable negotiating power to win the tools that we need to be outstanding researchers.\nThrough thousands of conversations with our coworkers, it has become clear that MIT does not provide us with sufficient resources to efficiently produce the best research possible. Many of us lack the equipment and materials we need, have difficulty accessing centralized research infrastructure due to lack of staffing or high turnover (for example, in administrative and core facilities roles), waste excessive time fixing outdated equipment, and have unremediated lab safety concerns. We have been frustrated when we have spoken up about these issues individually and been ignored or dismissed. Even when our advisors have tried to help, the issues only ever seem to rise one or two rungs up the hierarchy of MIT’s bureaucracy, remaining unaddressed. Administrators claim it is out of their hands to address staffing and facilities issues. By standing together on these issues which span labs, departments, and schools, our union can amplify our collective voice to create material improvements on these workplace issues.\nGraduate workers at MIT currently lack a well-defined job description, leaving the boundaries of our responsibilities extremely ambiguous. As a result, when there is an inappropriate lack of investment in support staff and research infrastructure, we are forced to pick up the slack. Research already involves an incredibly diverse workload: designing and conducting experiments, fabricating materials and devices, analyzing data and characterizing our systems, generating figures, and writing papers. When we also have to take on administrative or maintenance tasks, it detracts from our ability to do researchwell.\nThough many universities,including MIT, claim that graduate students aren’t workers, many MIT graduate researchers spend a disruptive fraction of their time — or even a majority — on tasks that don’t directly advance their research or their education. For science and engineering fields, when a lab doesn’t have a lab manager or consistent administrative support, we graduate researchers are often roped into tasks like:\nOrdering equipment and supplies (submitting purchasing orders, meeting with sales representatives, drafting budget proposals).\nResearching, managing, and maintaining equipment, service contracts, and vendor relationships.\nFixing machines that are only broken because they’re either too old to be serviced or being used for tasks they aren’t designed for.\nProviding administrative help in classes for which we are not TAs (making copies, running Canvas, teaching classes when the PI has a scheduling conflict).\nScheduling group meetings or visitor agendas.\nManufacturing our own reagents or testing apparatuses.\nWorking on pet projects for our PIs instead of our dissertation research.\nWriting our PIs’ grants and reports without their help or contributions.\nServing as our PIs’ personal moving crew when they move facilities.\nServing as our PIs’ babysitter or petsitter.\nFor graduate researchers, saying no to these tasks complicates our relationships with our advisors. We do this unpaid work because we fear for our funding, timeline for graduation, and prospect for job recommendations.With a union, we will be able to delineate basic job descriptions for graduate workers, and most importantly, we will have the power to ensure our time is spent on advancing research rather than fixing broken equipment.Recognizing the heterogeneity of research across the Institute, we can establish and enforce clear bounds on what an RAship is and is not.\nThe MIT dogma of decentralization insists that every Department/Lab/Center’s (DLC) needs are so unique that they cannot possibly adopt any of the same policies and practices successfully. But the reality is, across all departments, we share some common struggles that prevent us from researching in an efficient and sustainable way:\nUnclear job descriptions and workload expectations.\nInadequate protection of university holidays, sick days, and vacation days.\nUnclear guidelines within research collaborations between groups or institutions.\nMental or physical health issues.\nInconsistent or inadequate mentorship.\nLack of adequate work space.\nOf course, there are still department or field-specific issues. Some departments don’t guarantee PhD students year-round funding. Others haveattrition rate gapsandqualifying examinitial pass ratediscrepancies between genders and underrepresented minorities. Researchers in the humanities and social sciences have fixed-term funding schedules, with little opportunity for extensions or dissertation-year fellowships. This makes the situation for these researchers more precarious, in particular when they sufferdelays to their research, or when the job market worsens, ashas happened during the pandemic.\nThe MIT Graduate Student Union (GSU) is composed of a majority of workers in every department to capture a diversity of experiences when developing bargaining goals. Ensuring representation will give us the opportunity to negotiate a contract that meets every department’s —and every worker’s— needs.\nOther graduate worker unions have won contract provisions guaranteeing access to the equipment, facilities, and institutional support that graduate workers reasonably need to do their jobs (see, for example, theUniversity of Michigan,University of Connecticut, andUniversity of California system). Contracts also protect graduate workers from overwork and burnout by setting clear standards for work hours and time off — while allowing graduate workers to work more than the specified amountfor their own research and teaching goalswhen they choose to do so.Union contracts empower graduate workers to manage our time in a way that is healthy, balanced, and constructive.\nTeachers unionize toreduce class sizesso they can focus on providing the best education possible to their students. Nurses unionize tofight understaffing so they can give their patients quality care.We’re unionizing so we can focus on conducting world-class research.Only when every single scholar at MIT — every electrical engineer, historian, chemist, architect, evolutionary biologist — is empowered to show up fully for their work will we reach our true potential.
