Increasing diversity does not always increase inclusion in our higher education system, inclusion deserves its own priority.” Illustration published on Monday, Feb. 8, 2021.\nAffirmative action is a process many universities utilize to make sure their programs meet a certain minimum for marginalized groups. While this system may seem helpful at diversifying campuses on the surface, it is simply putting a Band-Aid on systematic issues.\nAffirmative action is peakperformative activism,as it focuses on making schools look more appealing than actually making sure marginalized communities aregetting equal opportunities.\nIt feels as though universities are more focused ontokenism, rather than making sure marginalized students succeed. This is where the issue lies.\nAccording to a statement from Herminia Rincon, who works with media relations at ASU, the University upholds its mission statement in itsaffirmative action plan, where ASU values adiverse campus, inclusivity and accessibility. They do not currently have a cap on student admissions, and any student who meets the enrollmentrequirementswill be admitted to ASU, regardless of race or ethnicity.\nAffirmative action developed in the1960sas racial segregation was outlawed. It was created during theKennedy administrationto prevent employment discrimination. This served as a way to integrate students, but now the affirmative action Band-Aid is beginning to collect dirt around the edges, and we need to do better as a nation.\nIt’s time to rip off the bandageand let the wound caused by years ofsystemic racismin our country heal.\nOne issue with affirmative action its association withhigh dropout ratesfrom BIPOC students. The idea of a student being simply admitted to a program because of their background, rather than their intelligence, can feeldiscouraging.\nAlmost 70%of white students graduate from higher education, compared to about 50% of Black and Latine students. This shows affirmative action isn't completely doing its job. Just because BIPOC students are getting into a university, doesn't necessarily mean they are being equipped with the tools they need to succeed in that university.\nAdditionally, a school's diverse student body is not authentically represented through their admission rates, but rather through theirgraduation rates. For a student of color to graduate, they must succeed at every level of academia, which requires ingrained confidence instilled at ayoung age.\nAffirmative action is also discriminatory againstAsian students.Universities across the country, such as Harvard and Yale, recently faced alawsuitdue to their policies discriminating Asian Americans. Though the lawsuit was later dropped by theDepartment of Justice,it does make you wonder why we still have these policies in the first place.\n\"The outcome of this lawsuit was no surprise to me. It was brought up by a conservative group who did not seem to have any interest in helping the Asian students,\" saidMichael Selmi, a professor at theSandra Day O'Connor School of Law.\"It felt reminiscent of the cases that were brought up in the 1980s.\"\nInitially, I responded to this issue by wondering why universities don't simply admit students based on their high school academic performance.In fact, many states across the country, includingArizona,have banned affirmative action, and instead opt for a \"race-blind\" approach to admit students to universities.\nHowever, following this decision, several states saw asharp dropin the admissions of Black and Latine students.\nMany critics of affirmative action say it is a form of\"reverse racism,\"discriminating against white people.\nI am outraged by this rhetoric, especially since many white people go tobetter schoolsand are more likely to have parents who arecollege graduates. This doesn't count for every individual, as low-income white people do exist, but it does paint a bigger picture of themajority experience.\nThis proves reverse racism is a myth.\nThough I believe affirmative action is archaic and serves as a way to assuage a deeper issue, I also don't think it's right for states to simply take it away without making sure BIPOCstudents are getting a good education.\nIn many states, there is a huge gap betweenK-12 educationbased on income level. This gap is deeply tied to race. The 1960s was only 60 years ago, andneighborhoods across the countryare still facing the effects ofredliningandblockbusting,which were processes used in theJim Crowperiod to prevent Black families from moving into wealthy, white neighborhoods.\nWhile some families managed to climb the ladder out of poverty and intobetter living situationsin the past 60 years, others are still suffering. As we can see by looking atdemographic maps, many neighborhoods, includingArizona, are still largely segregated.\nMany of these schools have less access toextracurricular activitiesorAP-level classes,which can determine college success.\n\"Ensuring that predominantly black and brown schools have adequate resources should be part of any educational system,\" Selmi said.\nAdditionally, due to theracial tensioncaused by affirmative action, many of these students do not complete college because they may feel unprepared or disconnected from their peers.\nThe goal shouldn't be, \"how many Black and Brown studentsget into college?\" The goal should be focusing on how many Black and Brown students graduate college.\nThis means giving them access to the tools needed to succeed from a young age, this way we no longer need affirmative action.\nReach the columnist athtenore@asu.eduor follow@haleyyhmton Twitter.\nEditor’s note: The opinions presented in this column are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
