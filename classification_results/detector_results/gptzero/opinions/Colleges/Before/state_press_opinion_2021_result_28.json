In fact, receiving the vaccine isstrongly recommendedby the CDC.\n\"The vaccines that we currently have in this country are excellent,\" said Dr. Joshua LaBaer, the executive director of theBiodesign Institute. \"Nobody has had a severe case and died from COVID-19 if they've been vaccinated.\"\nASU is supporting the distribution of the vaccine within our community byproviding on-site vaccinationsat the Sun Devil Fitness Complex in Tempe for individuals who categorize under Arizona’s currentvaccine prioritization phase, which nowincludes individuals 16 and older.\nAdditionally, the university recently released a COVID-19 vaccination survey, which provides essential feedback on immunization statuses. With this data accumulating, a vaccine requirement would be relatively easy to process and track.\nAlthough these efforts are steps in the right direction, ASU should be doing more to manage the risks of returning to campus this fall.\nVaccination mandates are rapidly becoming a part of the conversation formany institutionsthat hope to bring students back in-person. If a virus poses enough of a threat to individual health, bothstatesandindividual organizationshave the jurisdiction to enforce the vaccination of its citizens or employees.\nThat being said, ASU could very likely enforce that all members of our community receive the COVID-19 vaccine.\nAccording to Jennifer Piatt, a research scholar at theSandra Day O'Connor College of Law, individuals legally have the option to accept or refuse the vaccination requirement, however, consequences such as being denied access to campus or in-person classes will likely ensue.\nWith the amount of time before the fall semester and the increasingly rapid vaccination rollout, it seems feasible that the ASU faculty and student body could receive the vaccine prior to coming on campus.\n\"A lot of colleges and universities are thinking about it, potentially for students who are returning in the fall, that gives you know, summer, and a chance to kind of open up eligibility for those who want to get vaccinated,\" Piatt said.\nASU should protect all individuals on their premises, especially in the midst of a global pandemic. Enforcing that students return in-person without herd immunity is putting everyone at risk, and if ASU truly cared about the health of their community members, the university would ensure that necessary precautions are being taken.\nThe most promising tool we have in fighting the virus is the vaccine, and we should be making plans to enforce it rather than having conversations about requiring it.\nASU claims its efforts are focused on student success and the overall well-being of our community, yet our health is at stake now more than ever without immunization. For ASU members to thrive, they must be fully protected.\nReach the columnist atcrreich@asu.eduor follow@cassidyreich1on Twitter.\nEditor’s note: The opinions presented in this column are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
