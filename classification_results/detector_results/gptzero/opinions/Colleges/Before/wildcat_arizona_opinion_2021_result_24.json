For many people the difference in treatment can leave us believing that in order to be successful and go far in life we must have a perfect physical appearance.\nIt’s important that we step back and take physical appearance out of the picture. There is more to life than this. However, in our society today many people don’t see this and are fixated on appearances and have an obsession with looks.\nNBC’s The Today Show and AOLconducted a survey that focused on our obsession with our appearance. Through their research they found that women spend about 55 minutes per day on their appearance. This is equal to about 335 hours a year.  The NBC and AOL study also found that, “Our obsession with our appearance starts almost the moment we wake” and reported that about half of adults think about their looks at least several times a day.\nOur obsession with beauty and our appearance comes from the compliments, praise and opportunities others give to those who are viewed as more attractive. It’s important that we also focus on features that are not physical, and give compliments that aren’t appearance related to help change this scenario.\nInstead of complimenting and praising individuals solely on their looks, think about their character, actions and how they make you feel. The less we point out and praise physical traits the more focus we will have on what really matters, personality, character and actions.\nFollow Julianna Strano onTwitter\n\nJulianna is a senior majoring in journalism and sociology.
