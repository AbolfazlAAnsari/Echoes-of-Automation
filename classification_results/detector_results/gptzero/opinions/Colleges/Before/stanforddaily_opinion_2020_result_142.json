            "inputText": "Dear Stanford Community,\nThe ASSU is committed to ensuring that student voices are solicited and heard when decisions are made at the University. As we all know, next year will bring many challenges (as this past quarter has so clearly demonstrated) and at all points throughout the process, the ASSU hopes to ensure that student opinions and perspectives are front and center. As the first item, the ASSU reached out to get input on when students wish to be on campus next year and related issues.\nHere are the results of that survey which speak to the ideas, aspirations, and preferences for next year. The results have been shared with the administration and hopefully they are taking them into consideration as they proceed with planning. You can find the underlying data tableshereif you wish to peruse them yourself.\nThank you to all students who responded to the survey. There were 2,699 responses  (1,536 textual responses — 51,917 words!) distributed among class year as follows:\nIn particular, the text responses added significant nuance and reflected the great care and thought so clearly put into them.\nGeneral Takeaways\nThere were a number of overarching themes in the responses that were consistent across years:\nClass Preferences\nThe chart below shows the relative preferences of different class years for different quarters.\nThere are a number of key takeaways to highlight in the data:\nWho Is Assigned Summer?\nAssuming no change is made to the overall plan, summer is the most difficult quarter to allocate. While all class years have distaste of a relatively similar magnitude, there was a bit of variation with Frosh being the most averse, then Juniors, and finally Seniors and Sophomores with similar preferences:\nThe survey also illustrated why each grade was so reluctant to select summer:\nIn addition there were a few reasons generally given why summer was undesirable:\nMany have asked, “Based on the survey data, what is the ideal layout?” In truth, there is no clear answer based on the survey data since summer was so undesirable. One must use reasoning other than this survey to allocate the summer. However, once two years are chosen to be on campus during the summer, the rest of the year falls nicely into place based on respondents’ preferences. Woe unto thee who will ultimately need to decide who is stuck with summer quarter.\nScenarios Given Summer Configurations\nYou can find the calculated ideal layout for the rest of the year given a summer configuration in the appendix. The calculations seek to maximize overall preferences and prevent students from receiving their fourth choice. The model also minimizes the number of move ins/outs needed and each year was given the opportunity to spend their two quarters on campus with a different second class year.\nExceptions\nAnother theme that emerged is the importance of allowing individual students to be granted an exception to be on campus during a different quarter than their class year. A full list of exception criteria suggested through the survey can be found in the appendices.\nAs always, your feedback, opinions, and questions are welcome. Ultimately this decision will be made by the administration, but the ASSU is here to support you and advocate for the best possible policies. Feel free to write directly to the administration atacademic-continuity@stanford.eduor reach the ASSU atassu.stanford.edu.\nSincerely yours,\nJonathan Lipman, ASSU Undergraduate Senator\nContact Jonathan Lipman at jonathan.lipman ‘at’ stanford.edu\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.

The twin modeling objectives were to satisfy overall preferences and prevent people from receiving their fourth choice. Assumptions: the configurations minimize the number of move ins/outs needed and each year was given the opportunity to spend their two quarters on campus with a different second class year.\nAppendix 2: Respondents’ suggested reasons for an exception\nIn addition to the main determination of who will be on campus based on class year, there were a number of proposals for special circumstance that might warrant an exception. All of the submitted circumstances are listed here:\nAppendix 3: Raw data\nAppendix 4: Merged preferences\nAppendix: 5 Alternative Ideas Proposed By Respondents\n\n"
