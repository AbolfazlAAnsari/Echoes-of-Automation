On move-in day, I was recruited within minutes by my O-week advisor and former managing editor Anna Ta to write for the Thresher’s news section. My first story on Fondren Library’s new furniture wasn’t the most groundbreaking, but it was the beginning of my storytelling journey at Rice. I quickly came to appreciate the privilege of being able to weave together voices of diverse campus constituents, bring timely news to our audience and play a small part in this storied organization full of the most driven, kind and collegial people I have met at Rice.\nThe Thresher does incredibly important work on campus, telling stories of not only joy and celebration, but also of pain, uncertainty and injustice. Student journalism can often be simultaneously exhausting and rewarding, especially when we cover heavy topics such as pedestrian deaths, sexual assault or the COVID-19 pandemic—few of the stories I have had the honor of working on. I often hear comments in passing about Thresher journalists being “out to get” students, the Student Association or administrators. I can assure you this is never the case. Remember that we are fellow students seeking to deliver truth to the community with the best intentions in mind. I am deeply appreciative of every student, staff member, faculty and administrator that has shared their stories, data and viewpoints with me. Without the Rice community’s buy-in, the important work we do would not be possible.\nThrough my years as a news writer, editor and editor-in-chief, I have realized that journalism requires immense collaboration and mutual support within our organization. Two nights ago was my last Monday Meeting—our weekly gathering of our full staff to discuss business and plan for the week. I have attended close to 90 of such meetings, which were always in person pre-pandemic. Seeing the faces of dozens of staffers, even on a computer screen, reminds me of the incredible strengths of each member that collectively make this organization so wonderful.\nI have never thought of the Thresher as work. While I have wound up in the office till midnight on Mondays and Tuesdays back-to-back, pushing back school work to the early dawn hours, I have loved every minute of producing something meaningful each week alongside my fellow staffers. Serving as editor-in-chief for this year has been a unique privilege and challenge. We lost much of the in-person component that had made the Thresher so special for me, but the sense of community, work ethic and desire to cover the most pressing issues was undiminished.\nIn closing, I would like to give a big shoutout to my co-editor-in-chief Ivanka Perez, managing editor and former co-news editor Amy Qin and our wonderful Director of Student Media Kelley Lash. Without these amazing people by my side, I would not have made it through this year.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
