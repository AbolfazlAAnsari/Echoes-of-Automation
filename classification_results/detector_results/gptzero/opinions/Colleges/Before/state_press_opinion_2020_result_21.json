This multi-billion dollar corporation provides food in prisons and jails.\" Illustration published Friday, July 10, 2020.\nOne way for ASU to end the perpetuation of harm toward vulnerable populations is by ending business ties with food-service providerAramark.\nThemulti-billion dollarcorporation’s services are widespread on ASU campuses: in the dining halls, convenience stores like the POD and many on-campus restaurants. Beyond working with universities, Aramark also provides food in prisons and jails.\nStudents demand that the University cancels its contract with the company. Apetitionof students demanding the University cancels its contract with the company was created by Tori Vandekop, a senior studying communication. The petition has over 1,300 signatures as of Tuesday.\nLooking at the company’s misdeeds, this course of action is justified.\nREAD MORE:Missing the mark\nOne issue with Aramark is that it fuels theprison-industrial complex. This term refers to both privately-owned prisonsandcorporationsproviding services in prisons and financially benefitting from people’s imprisonment.\nThinking abt how@asuforces students to fund the prison industrial complex by contracting with Aramark and installing mandatory meal plans for freshmen\nThe prison-industrial complex presents a serious problem.\n“The intersection of capital accumulation and mass incarceration creates a perverse incentive for incarceration,” said Richard Glover, a graduate student studying justice studies and adjunct faculty member atSchool of Social Transformation.\nWhile companies like Aramark are not the root cause of mass incarceration, Glover said when businesses useprison labororprovide servicesin prisons, they are invested in perpetuating incarceration.\n\"That means all of these companies have an interest in seeing prisons remain full,” he said.\nThis leads businesses that drive the prison-industrial complex to stifle any efforts to decrease theswelling of prisons.\n“The past 40 years or so of privatization, deregulation and mass incarceration as a cultural, social and political practice have created a system wherein profit is tied to punishment,\" Glover said. \"Any effort to reduce mass incarceration will be met with resistance bypowerful industrieswho have built significant chunks of their businesses on this model.\"\nMonetary gain for companies like Aramark doesn’t just create incentives for incarceration to persist. These businesses also exploit the incarcerated population by putting profit above the safety of their clients.\nIn Aramark’s case, for example, inmates in Michigan prisons have foundrocksandmaggotsin their food. Aramark has also served prisonersspoiled foodand inadequate portion sizes. When the company cut down on food quality in Florida prisons, it saved10.5 million dollarswhile inmate meal participation decreased. It is clear Aramark disregards the wellbeing of incarcerated people to prioritize profit.\nCompanies making large sums from mass-incarceration engage in an unethical process. The U.S. has thehighest incarceration ratein the world, and imprisoned individuals — ahigh numberbeingBlack or poor— aren’t pawns to exploit in order to maximize profit margins. The prison-industrial complex perpetuates unjust treatment toward prisoners and Aramark is anotable player.\nAramark’s misdeeds aren't limited to its involvement with prisons. It has atrack record ofpoor treatmenttoward workers and relying onunethical food sourcing, amongseveral other issues.\nASU President Michael Crow released astatementon June 1 addressing the killing of George Floyd and questioned the \"systems and institutions that can carry out and often justify injustices.\"\nHe opened the floor for discussions on how the University can do more to address injustices and said these questions of injustices \"are questions that we can and should not only address but attack and begin to resolve.\"\nJoshua Pardhe, a junior studying computer systems engineering, joined Vandekop in forming a student coalition to end Aramark's contract with the University. He said the coalition is answering the calls from Crow by speaking out against the food supplier.\n\"Aramark is a system that carries out and often justifies its wrongdoings, so as a coalition, we are working to answer this call to action by President Crow by working to replace Aramark at ASU,\" Pardhe said in an email.\nPardhe said ASU must follow through with itscharter, which says the University has a \"fundamental responsibility for the economic, social, cultural and overall health of the communities it serves.\"\nThe charter \"must apply to all aspects of the University, including food service providers,\" he said.\nBecause ASU provides significant business to Aramark, our ties to the company continues to fuel its misdeeds. The University has an obligation to uphold its values and supporting Aramark violates them.\nStudents do not want to be forced into supporting this company through our meal plans and dining options. ASU must stop doing business with Aramark and find an ethical food-service provider to manage our dining services instead.\nThe petition can be foundhere. Students interested in the student-led coalition against Aramark should emailTori Vandekop, coalition co-lead,Joshua Pardhe, coalition co-lead, orJoseph Early, communications co-lead.\nReach the columnist atlhrabik@asu.eduor follow@lynettehrabikon twitter\nEditor’s note: The opinions presented in this column are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
