            "inputText": "\"COVID conspiracy theorists argues against Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendations. Their misinformation is a concern to public safety.\" Illustration published July 30, 2020.\nWe often hear that we should “question everything,” butconspiracy theoriescan stretch our skepticism too far. In making sense of this year's madness, some are prone to illogicalconspiracy thinking.\nCOVID-19and the pandemic are the subjects of many unfounded, widely circulatedtheories, and believing in these ideas can be dangerous. During global crises, decisions based on misinformation and invalid reasoning have real-world implications.\nFor instance, some conspiracy theoristsundermineexpert suggestions to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19,which poses risks to public health.\nWhile experts state that mask-wearing helpspreventthe virus from spreading, with some experts even suggesting masks provide moderateprotectionfor wearers, severalanti-maskersbelieve masks are unnecessary.\nThey often point to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention'ssupposed flip-flopping: arguing that because the organizationreorientedits stance on mask-wearing, their expert advice is now deemed illegitimate.\nInconsistent messaging, however, does not delegitimize expert claims. As more evidence surfaced about how COVID-19 spreads from people who don't show symptoms, the CDC decided to suggestmask-wearingin public. Experts continue to understand more about the virus with time.\nIn an email response, Dr. Keith Brown, director of theMelikian Centerand professor at theSchool of Politics and Global Studies, said mistakes are normal in the pursuit of understanding new scientific information.\n“Conspiracy thinking thrives by seizing on the flaws, errors, or paradigm shifts that are baked into the processes of scientific knowledge-production to throw doubt in the entire scientific enterprise,” he said.\nPrevious messages about masks do not mean that current claims from experts are invalid.\n\"Peer review, repeating experiments and debating conclusions are good for public health,\" Brown said. \"Using anecdotal evidence to question the whole idea of expertise is not.\"\nAsreopeningshappen in several states and case numbers surge, it is risky for theorists to undermine expertadvicethat intends to keep us as safe as possible. To protect public health, we should follow mask-wearingguidelinesfrom organizations like theCDCand take any steps possible to decrease the spread.\nCOVID-19 conspiracy theories present another danger: polarization.\n“The danger of conspiracy thinking is that it polarizes society and erodes public trust,” Brown said.\nBecause theories are often tied to political positions, this creates animosity between conspiracy believers and others. With the rise intensionsbetween China and the U.S., baseless theories are circulating about the origins of the virus.\nFor example, some theorize that5Gtechnology fromHuawei, a Chinese technology company, weakens the immune system or helps spread the virus.\nOthers believe the pandemic is a “plandemic,” meaning the virus waslab-madeas a bioweapon. This conspiracy theory gained some traction asofficialsin both China and the U.S. spread the idea.\nAccording to asurveyof U.S. adults who heard about the theory that COVID-19 was planned, around one-quarter think it is “definitely true” or “probably true.\"\nBoth theories about 5G and the virus being manmade are false. COVID-19 was notcreatedin a lab and 5G doesn’tweakenthe immune system orspread the virus.\nBelief in these theories only augments antagonism. In the United Kingdom, anti-5G sentiment already played out in a devastating way, asarsonistsset 77 cell phone towers on fire.\nAs tension grows between China and the U.S., believing in unfounded theories generates misplaced distrust. Some say the two countries are already experiencing an unarmed conflict-styleCold War, so this animosity is consequential for foreign relations.\nIt is unnerving and hazardous when citizens and politicians escalate hostility based on untrue theories.\nIn uncertain times,misinformationis a legitimate cause for concern. While we can be prone to conspiracy thinking, we must recognize and reject false information.\nDon't assume conspiracy theories online are true: research, fact check and think critically. In an already tragic time for our world, it’s important we don't take actions that will create more harm to the health and safety of our communities and country at large.\nReach the columnist atlhrabik@asu.eduor follow@lynettehrabikon Twitter.\nEditor’s note: The opinions presented in this column are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
