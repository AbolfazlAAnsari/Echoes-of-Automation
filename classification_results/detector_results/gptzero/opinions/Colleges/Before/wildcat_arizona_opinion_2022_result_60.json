Protests like these will likely become much more common following Friday’s Roe v. Wade overruling.\nToday, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that in 1973 allowed women of this country the right to an abortion. Now, as the nation is at war with reproductive health, we are left wondering: “what does this mean for me?”\nIf you are young, old, middle-aged, partnered or single, this ruling applies to you. It affects everyone who lives in America and believes in freedom: freedom of choice, freedom to make decisions about one’s own body. This ruling is a step backward in the fight for a truly free democracy. But it is not over yet. There are still options for people who need, or want, to get an abortion. Here’s what is available to you:\nIf you are living in Tucson, I have good news for you: Mayor Regina Romero has publicly stated that she is in support of a woman’s right to choose. Ina Tweet posted this morning, Romero said, “Though not unexpected, this infringement of our rights is hard to accept. The Supreme Court has delivered a wrecking ball, dismantling the rights of SOME people in this country.#IDissent.”\nAnd Romero is not just talking—she’s taken action to protect the rights of women’s choice over their own bodies. In aunanimous rulingalong with Tucson’s city council made in early June, Romero passed a resolution to uphold abortion rights for women, as well as to protect physicians performing abortions. This contradicts Arizona’s law SB1164 which dictates that physicians performing abortions would face charges of a Class 6 Felony. This means that the Tucson Police Department willnot arrest physicians performing abortionsor take action to arrest those seeking abortions themselves.\nRELATED:Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade\nThis is a point of hope for those who seek out and perform abortions. However, Gov. Doug Duceysaid in a statement to KGUN9that the city of Tucson does not have the right to make such statements, and he will rescind state funding to the city should they continue down this path. The consequences of this for Tucson residents are unclear.\nAs of now, Arizona residents may still get an abortion.According to Politico, access to abortion in the state is still permissible until the fetus reaches viability. For those who are unaware, viability refers tothe state of the fetus’ developmentwhere it is capable of living. But this will not remain forever.The ban on abortionswill go into effect no later than Sept. 29.\nThere is quite a bit that you can do to fight for pro-choice policies during this tumultuous time. The Arizona Primary Election is coming up on Aug. 2. You can find a list of candidates and what they stand for on the12 News website.\nIn preparation for the Nov. 8 election for the Senate and House of Representatives, Arizonans for Reproductive Freedom is floating a petition that, if signed by 350,000 Arizona registered voters, will have a chance of making it on the ballot.According to KGUN9, the petition aims to make women’s reproductive rights part of Arizona’s Constitution.\nIn order for the petition to have a chance of making it on the ballot, petitioners must sign by July 7. Check out Arizonans for Reproductive Freedom’swebsitefor information on how and where to sign.\nIf you are currently seeking an abortion in the Tucson area, theTucson Abortion Support Collectivehas plenty of information for those seeking help or care.Planned Parenthood Tucsonalso has many different options and opportunities for care and help for those in need.\nThe Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade will change the landscape of this nation for years to come, but the fight for freedom in women’s reproductive healthcare is not over. You can still make a difference and help protect the rights of women everywhere to choose what happens to their own bodies.\nFollow theDaily WildcatonTwitter\n\nSophie Applin is the current Opinions Editor for theDaily Wildcat.
