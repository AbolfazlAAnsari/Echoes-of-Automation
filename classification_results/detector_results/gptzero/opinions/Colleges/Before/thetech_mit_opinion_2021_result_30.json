It is unlikely that MIT has the capacity to do the same with everyone attending Commencement in person, not to mention people’s unwillingness to quarantine for a week or longer, right before or after graduating. While the guidelines may change in the coming months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently advise quarantining for a full week after travel, further complicating the logistics of a ceremony most will need to travel to attend. Additionally, the subsequent dispersal of people after Commencement poses a risk if cases arise following the gathering.\nWhere other universities may have made sufficient preparations ahead of time for in-person commencements with these constraints in mind, it is unfortunately unreasonable to expect that MIT, in the approximately two months left before the scheduled ceremony, can make the same provisions while also guaranteeing the safety of both the students in attendance and the staff necessary to support the undertaking of an in-person commencement.\nMore importantly, however, having an opt-in ceremony excludes those who cannot choose to attend. There are students in the Class of 2021 who are unable to fly themselves or their families into Boston, whether because of international travel restrictions, financial circumstances, or being at high risk for COVID-19. If the intent was to bring everyone in the class together for one final hurrah, not allowing everyone an equal chance to do so defeats the entire purpose.\nIt’s true that other schools are planning in-person commencement ceremonies, but each school’s administration should have the agency to make separate decisions, particularly because each school faces different difficulties due to the pandemic and follows different state guidelines. It’s also true that the Class of 2021 is one that will end up sadly overlooked with regard to special goodbyes, but having a commencement ceremony only for those who are privileged enough to attend would be a bitter last impression for the Class of 2021 to leave on MIT. The petition may describe the potential in-person commencement as an “opt-in” ceremony, but many seniors do not have the option to opt in at all.\n“Closure” is a word that has been used a lot to justify demands for an in-person commencement, but remember that closure itself is a psychological phenomenon. A ceremony is not going to instantly provide closure, especially if it results in an outbreak. Instead, focus on spending these last two months with those in the MIT community who matter to you, especially the ones you will miss in the coming years. Throw small, safe graduation parties with the people who will genuinely celebrate the years of effort you’ve put into your well-earned degrees.\nMIT will still be here for you, for visits, for reunions, and in the many lifetime connections you’ve made during your time at the ’tvte.\nEditorials are the official opinion ofThe Tech.
