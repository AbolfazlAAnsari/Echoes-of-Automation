The level of financial strain may vary, but many of us share the same sentiment of how expensive being a college student is.\nCollege students have a range of expenses to worry about that are both directly and indirectly caused by their decision to pursue higher education. We have to worry about tuition, housing, textbooks, school supplies, transportation, food, the list goes on. And that doesn’t include the other miscellaneous costs that we may bring into our college experiences such as cellphone plans, clothes to wear for important occasions, internet service or car insurance.\nConsidering all of these costs into the typical college student’s budget, it doesn’t leave much room for a student to indulge in any form of entertainment. Want to go to the movies? Well, be prepared to just eat instant ramen for the next couple of weeks.\nLuckily for us, companies out there understand the strain our pockets go through on a daily basis and have granted us one of the many perks of being a student: student discounts.\nI have compiled a list of 10 student discounted online subscriptions that college students can take advantage of.\n1.Amazon Prime\nAmazon Prime is a membership program Amazon offers that comes with a variety of perks. These perks include free two-day shipping, access to Amazon Video (Amazon’s streaming service), unlimited photo storage with Prime Photos, access to Prime Music, special deals and more. The cost of an Amazon Prime subscription for typical users is about $14.99 monthly and $139 yearly, however, Amazon offers a special discount for students called Amazon Prime Student.\nAmazon Prime Student subscriptions are roughly 50% off the regular price ($7.49 monthly and $69 yearly). All that you need to receive this discount is your university student email to confirm your status and for four years you’ll receive this discounted price.\nNot sure if Amazon Prime is for you? Another cool perk that comes with the student discount is that students start off with a six-month free trial when signing up. So, you’ll be able to enjoy swift deliveries as well as watch the latest Prime Video movies and shows.\n2.Grubhub+\nGrubhub is a food ordering and delivery app that adds a layer of convenience for users. It is especially popular amongst college students and college campuses, partnering with over 250 college campuses according toRestaurant Dive. Grubhub offers a membership program called Grubhub+ that offers perks to users such as unlimited free delivery on orders $12 or more from selected restaurants, Elite Care (VIP customer service) and other added benefits. This membership normally costs $9.99 monthly.\nThere is no direct discount on the cost, but students who have an Amazon Prime Student account can sync their account to their Grubhub account and receive Grubhub+ for free. This lasts as long as they have an Amazon Prime Student account. Students should be aware though that if they have alcohol in their orders, the Grubhub+ benefits won’t apply.\n3.Hulu\nHulu is a video streaming service that offers access to popular movies and films as well as offers original content. There are two levels of membership that come with this service. The ad-supported plan costs about $6.99 monthly while the no-ads plan costs about $12.99 monthly.\nStudents get a discounted price when signing up for Hulu that only costs students $1.99 monthly, however, this plan is ad-supported so students will receive ads while watching their video content. If students already have a Hulu account, they can switch to the student plan by accessing their account page and selecting the Hulu student discount.\nIn either case, students will be prompted to verify their enrollment status by inputting their university student email. Hulu uses a third-party verification service called SheerID to verify their status. This discount will last for four years.\n4.Paramount+\nParamount+ is another video streaming service that gives users access to a variety of content ranging from live sports, movies, shows and original content. A typical Paramount+ membership costs about $4.99 monthly for the ad-supported plan as well as about $9.99 monthly for the commercial-free plan.\nParamount+ offers a discount for students that takes 25% off the basic plan which roughly equals around $3.74 monthly. This plan is ad-supported so students will receive ads while watching video content. To get this discount, students will need to verify their student credentials which includes their name, date of birth and name of their university. Once verified, students will have access to this discounted price for four years.\n5.Discovery+\nFor any students who are history buffs or reality TV bingers, Discovery+ is the video streaming service for them. Discovery+ offers content that includes networks like “Food Network,” “Animal Planet,” “TLC” and more. A subscription costs about $4.99 monthly for the ad-supported plan and $6.99 monthly for the ad-free plan.\nDiscovery+ offers a discounted price of $2.99 monthly for the ad-supported plan, which is roughly 40% off the regular price. Students who sign up for the first time will receive a seven-day free trial. In order to receive this discounted price, students must verify their student status with student documentation. This may include a student ID, a class schedule or anything that proves a student’s enrollment status.\nDiscovery+ uses a third-party verification service called SheerID in order to verify status. Students will have to re-verify every 12 months in order to continue receiving this discounted price.\nRELATED:OPINON: Your definitive guide to some campus resources that are and are not worth it\n6.Spotify\nSpotify is a music streaming service that allows you to listen to an endless amount of music ranging from Pop, R&B, Classics, Rap and more.
