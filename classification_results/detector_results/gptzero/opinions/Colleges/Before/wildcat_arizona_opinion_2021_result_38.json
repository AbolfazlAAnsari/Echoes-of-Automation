            "inputText": "Wildcats lose to the Beavers 38-56 and by losing this game, Arizona has now had three consecutive loses.\nThe football team is bringing back the Desert Swarm uniforms. So what?\nThe hype built up around the Arizona football team this year is enormous, from banners hanging up of football players to social media clips of intense practices and constant interviews of players and coaches about the upcoming season.\nThe theme the football team has adopted this year is “It’s personal.” Clearly, the coaches and players want to send a message to Tucson and NCAA teams around the country that this season is going to be different.\nOn Aug. 4, 2021, the Wildcats made their first big statement of the year when they announced the football team would change their uniform to the “Desert Swarm” design permanently.\nThe history of these uniforms is they were worn during the 1990s in what Arizona fans say was the most dominant era of football in the school’s history. The Wildcats finished with double-digit wins for the first time in 1993 and later went on to win the Fiesta Bowl against Miami 29-0. A broadcaster by the name of Russ Francis likened Arizona’s style of defensive to the Persian Gulf War, and hence the nickname of the uniforms was born.\nAny fan or college student may get hyped over this news and cannot wait to see the first game played, but is this news about the uniforms a big deal?\nThis sounds like nothing more than a sad attempt to get people excited for the upcoming season. It is a desperate mission to erase the awful memories of the worst season Arizona has ever had last year. To me, it showcases a lack of confidence in that you need to hype up a uniform for fans to come out to a game instead of the team. That makes sense though, because the football team has given Arizona fans nothing to cheer about in a while. In case nobody remembers, here are some stats from the 2020 football season.\nRELATED:What are Arizona Football’s expectations this season?\nThe Desert Swarm uniforms are considered a symbol of dominance, so it makes no sense to allow a team that has not won a game in two years to wear them.\nOne of the highlights of the ’93 Fiesta Bowl team was its defense, which only allowed 50 yards per game that season. Last year, Arizona boasted one of the worst defenses in the conference. The Wildcat defense allowed the most points per game (39.8), yards per game (473), rushing yards per game (270.6), had the fewest sacks (2), defensive touchdowns (0) and tied for the least number of interceptions (2) and fumble recoveries (1).\nThis is a team full of athletes who have not proven anything other than they know how to lose and finish last at almost everything.\nI have seen sports fandom enter a new era over the last few years where if fans or journalists criticize a sports team or state facts, they are considered “mean” or “insensitive,” which I find to be silly. Every stat I have listed about the team above is true, so it is not mean or insensitive; it is just the truth.\nNo matter how good a uniform looks, it does not help a team win games and this year is going to be tough for Arizona.\nHere are some more facts about some of the upcoming opponents Arizona will face this year.\nIf the Wildcats dream of accomplishing that final bullet point, they must have a history-defining season. They will have to defeat each team listed above to secure a winning season and a potential bowl game bid. Keep in mind, I did not mention they still play UCLA.\nWhile I will be cheering on Arizona, I am realistic about the road ahead, which won’t be easy.\nFollowSean Fagan onTwitter"
