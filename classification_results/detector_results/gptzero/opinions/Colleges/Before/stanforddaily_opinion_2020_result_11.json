            "inputText": "In the midst of a nerve-wracking summer, remote fall quarter, disruptive pandemic and historic election, members of the Basic Needs Coalition (BNC) raised nothing short of $91,946.76 in community funds. In accordance withour mission, these funds were used to ensure thataccess to basic needswere not barriers to success for our peers and fellow Stanford community members.\nIn these last 90 days well over 1,000 donors, 100 coalition members and dozens of other dedicated individuals have unceasingly affirmed that wecannotcontinue to allowstudents to fall through the cracks— cracks that exist due to our prideful institution’s stubbornlynarrow understanding of the diverse student body it decided to admit.\nHere we provide updates to our stakeholders, through insights from just a few of the many amazing community members that have shaped the BNC, community members that took the time these last few months to simply and sincerely ask, “How can I help?”\nA data-informed approach\nPhoto of Patricia Wei ‘23\nPatricia Wei ’23 is one community member who found her answer in the Basic Needs Coalition. As a local student, Patricia was spared from the worst of theMarch mass evictionthat abruptly unhoused a majority of Stanford’s undergraduate population a week before spring-quarter finals.\nPatricia is aware of how lucky she was, noting “how important it is to acknowledge your privileges” and that “Covid hitting really showed meI need to step up for my community because I care about these people so much, I just want them to worry less, I just want them to know they can still be cared for.”\nDespite joining as a rising sophomore with no prior organizing experience, taking on a full course load, a part-time job and supporting her family, Patricia found herself indeed stepping up in important ways for this community. Most recently, she has served as a key coordinator in BNC’s collaborative data analysis efforts, involvingASSUmembers (notably Hannah Mieczkowski, co-director of affordability) andthe Stanford Daily Data Team. This data was collected to inform holistic, permanent solutions to meeting the community’s basic needs. Their analysis of the2020 ASSU Community Needs Surveyrevealed the (unsurprisingly) far from insignificant number of students struggling to meet their basic needs. To this point Patricia clarifies that, “we acknowledge that Stanford students have it relatively better compared to students in other universities or colleges. But the fact still remains:one person struggling with basic needs at Stanford is just one too many.”\nFundraising to support those we can\nWhile the Coalition fully affirms thatStanford must take ultimate responsibility for establishing a more permanent solution, we would be no better than the institution if we ignore those in our own communitycurrentlystruggling with basic needs.With or without an ongoing pandemic, our work strives to center the simple fact that being caught in this struggle is far from conclusive evidence of failed character or lack of effort.\nBoth thepastandpresentrefusal for the institution to fully recognize this unmet need remains the fundamental reason the BNC organizes robust fundraising campaigns in support of itsBasic Needs Fund (BNF). Designed by a diverse group of student organizers and fundamentally informed bygenerationsof First-Generation Low-Income (FLI) students and their experiences, the BNF is a diligently managed fund thatallows trusted community leaders to distribute support and fundingmore equitably and efficientlythan Stanford’s rigid and narrow policiesallow.\nPhoto of Thea Rossman ‘20\nThea Rossman ’20 brings important insights as a class-privileged student with the humility and class consciousness critical for doing this work. Returning from a leave of absence and then choosing to stay at Stanford for a coterminal master’s, Thea took the prospect of an extra year as an opportunity “to rethink my relationship and responsibility to Stanford, and really understand it as one of my communities.”\nThea has been instrumental in BNC fundraising efforts and securingfiscal sponsorshipwith theAcademic Mutual Aid Foundation(AMAF). This sponsorship allows donors willing to contribute larger amounts to mutually benefit from tax deductions. AMAF’s 501(c)3 status enables people to send money through donor-advised funds and some corporate matching policies.On top of that, an anonymous donor has offered to match every three dollars raised with one dollar, up to $10,000, forany donations made before Dec. 18.\nThese new partnerships open significant doors for larger donors and different funding resources. This has been a ray of hope amongst Coalition members, as much of the previous fundraising came from small-dollar donations personally provided by community members.\nKnowing that adisproportionateamount of that funding came from other FLI students and those in close association with the FLI community, Thea stresses that, “People in my position— Stanford students, faculty, and alums who have a family safety net,who have access to high-income careers, or who grew up class-privileged or wealthy, or all of the above — have not done our fair share. And we need to get real about that.”\nPreparing for a long road to real change\nWith so many people supporting their mission, the BNC recognizes the importance of ensuring that graduation, burnout and other phase-out processes do not break the momentum for change that so many have already invested in. As such, BNC’s advocacy and fundraising efforts are complemented by a robust new-member onboarding program headed by Sreya Guha ’22.\nPhoto of Sreya Guha ‘22\nSreya also had little organizing experience prior to the BNC, yet this Coalition has served as a critical incubator to her development as a leader and change maker. Drawing from her own observations while settling into the BNC, Sreya’s onboarding strategy assumes no prior experience with organizing. Instead it centers direct, personal connection to nurture new skills and leadership in anyone looking to learn. Sreya notes how the open and honest culture of the BNC is also reflected in her onboarding, as “there is no pretense at all of superiority, people are just really excited to welcome people into the Coalition… setting up one on ones and making them semi consistent removes the intimidation.It allows new members to honestly say they have no idea what’s going on.”\nAnd her strategy has worked. Today the BNC enjoys a culture of mutual mentorship, honesty and care as members of the Coalition excitedly welcome any and all interested contributors. In line with sustaining BNC efforts, members new and old are consistently encouraged to contribute only as much as is healthy and reasonable for them. Truly the biggest struggle is convincing interested members that theycanmeaningfully contributeregardlessof past experience, or lack thereof. To such members Sreya promises, “You don’t need experience at all. People don’t need to know how to fundraise;new ideas from inexperienced people make this interesting and so dynamic. It doesn’t take years to be creative, the investment and passion in our community is more important.”\nA sobering reminder\nPhoto of Poojit Hegde ‘23\nLastly Poojit Hegde ’23 affirms the power of this passion through his experiences as a strategist on our social media team. To Poojit and many others in the Coalition, the deep care fueling this work comes from a genuine love for the communities that we serve. In recalling some of the testimonies shared by students for social media campaigns and long-term advocacy, Poojit realized, “I can’t live in other people’s lives, but even just reading their experiences is the next best thing. I’ve seen the impact that we can have.”\nDespite the immense sums being raised, Coalition members are well aware this isnotthe permanent solution Stanford students need. As Poojit confesses,“There is so much more to do, and that kinda pushes me to stick around.”\nIn closing, for all the amazing work this Coalition has done and continues to do, it is absolutely imperative to remember thatit is Stanford,the institution, not our volunteer work force, that needs to take responsibilityfor the lack of basic needs access that has plagued its most vulnerable community members, even before this pandemic began.\nAt the same time we also honor Stanford,the community,that has and always will push for necessary change in this institution, change fueled by a shared and timeless commitment to doing what’s right.\nKeep up with BNC and our work throughInstagram,Twitter, andFacebook.
