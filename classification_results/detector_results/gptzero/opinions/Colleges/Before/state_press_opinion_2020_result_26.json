            "inputText": "\"Human's lack of compassion for sustainable practices are causing natural disasters.\" Tuesday, June 30, 2020.\nEven discounting indisputably human catastrophes, 2020 has been relentless. This year has given us wildfires fromCaliforniatoAustralia, a global pandemic and theearliest third-named tropical storm on record. Arizona hasn't been spared either, with abrush fireforcing evacuations and keeping part of a state highway closed.\nThe toll of these disasters is immense. The new coronavirus has infectedover 10 million people,killing over 500,000 worldwide. Tropical Storm Cristobal causedimmense damageto Mexico and the U.S. The Arizona brush fireshave burned over 150,000 acres. But, while disease, storms and fire are all considered natural phenomena, it takes human mismanagement to create a disaster.\nTake Arizona's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. InJanuary, Arizona was one of the first states to have a COVID-19 case. While the state governmentdeclareda public health emergency on March 12, Gov. Doug Ducey didn't limit public gatherings, as other states had done, untilMarch 19. A stay-at-home order wasn'tissueduntil the end of March, at which point victims had begun dying.\nAnd now, after a hasty reopening, Arizona hasa record number of hospitalizations and casesof the virus. While the disease is natural, the disastrous situation is completely unnatural.\nTo prove it, I'll compare our predicament to how things went down in Wuhan, the Chinese city where COVID-19 was first discovered.\nOn January 23, the central government of China put Wuhanunder quarantine. Masks were mademandatoryin public, and public health officialsstill are takingthe temperature of travelers leaving the city. Fully functional hospitals wererapidly constructedto accommodate the surge of cases. By April, the lockdown waseased, with citywide testing conducted as late asMay.\nWuhan reported 0 new cases byJune. Keeping masks on as a precaution, life in the city has slowlyreturned to normal.\nChina wasn't alone in addressing the hazard of COVID-19 head-on. Vietnam was accused ofoverreactionin its aggressive response to the virus, but through early efforts was able to keep infections low,without a single death reported.\nCubasent doctors to Italywhen the European country was at the height of its infection rate — an offer that the U.S.refused15 years ago when New Orleans was recovering from the unnatural disaster caused by the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina due to the U.S.'s ongoingeconomic blockadeof Cuba.\nMadison West graduated from ASU in 2019 with an M.S. in Justice Studies and an M.A. in Sustainability. She says that the \"natural\" in the term \"natural disasters\" takes responsibility away from human actions.\nIf disasters were unavoidable acts of God, then Wuhan should be far more greatly afflicted by COVID-19 than Arizona. Governments of action in China, Vietnam and Cuba fought for the people, declared war on the virus and emerged victorious.\nArizona's impatient and short-sighted rulers reflected the American government's way of confronting crisis: unable to sacrifice immediate economic interests, no matter the cost.\n\"When we're looking at 'natural disasters' like climate change, the brush fires or the coronavirus, they're natural in the sense that they might have happened, but they wouldn't have been this bad.\" West said. \"The 'natural' part of it takes away responsibility from human actions, specifically around capitalism.\"\nWest says that capitalist authorities are already forced to acknowledge some degree of personal responsibility for disasters, but that this responsibility is highly individualized when the causes are systemic.\n\"If you have a forest, and you dry it out, and companies dump flammable fluid all over it, and some kid accidentally drops a lit cigarette and lights the whole forest on fire, then is it really that kids fault?\" West said. \"Companies create these situations to begin with.\"\nStemming from theWhite House, there have been calls in the United States to blame China for the COVID-19 pandemic, despite its efforts to fight the virus and itsinternational solidaritywith countries affected by the disease. West says that this push of blame is an enlarged version of the move to assign individual responsibility for systemic, human causes.\n\"We can't prove where (the new coronavirus) came from, but we're just going to blame China because 'China is evil',\" West said. \"Better approaches to justice look at what harm was caused, how can we address the harm caused and how can we make sure that it doesn't happen again.\"\nWest also said that we should rethink negative assumptions of China's sustainability.\n\"China is kind of a boogeyman in sustainability circles,\" West said, \"but they're the only country thathit their Paris Climate Accordcommitment.\"\nWest said that to prevent future natural hazards from developing into disasters, the principles of sustainability should be adopted.\n\"You can't take more than you need, you can't take more without being able to replenish natural resources. That's the whole idea behind a balanced, planned economy,\" West said.\nInstead of resigning to the perceived inevitability of disaster, we should fight for a system that can confront crises and serve the people first.\nChina's COVID-19 response has been called the country'sSputnik moment, harkening to the sublime accomplishment in space travel by the Soviet Union that left the capitalist West in the dust.\nThis achievement is further proof that a rationally planned economy and a strong, centralized state can handle crises and confront disaster.\nReach the columnist atsmisceni@asu.eduor follow@IMiscenichon Twitter.\nEditor’s note: The opinions presented in this column are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
