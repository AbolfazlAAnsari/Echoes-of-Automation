In just two months heincited an insurrection,refused to confirm the outcomeof a free and fair election, andabandoned Texasduring a deadly natural disaster. All in all, I think that he is one of the most disgraceful people currently in office. That needs to change, and since he is not going to wake up tomorrow with a shiny new set of morals and a backbone, it is clear that Ted Cruz must go.\nLet’s start off way back in November. The 2020 election was only four months ago, but it feels like a lifetime of trauma has since passed. Joe Biden was declared the winner of the election after an incredibly stressful few days ofwaiting on ballots, during which Americans were unified in the experience of learning where Maricopa County is and just how many people there are in Pennsylvania. Even before Biden could give his victory speech, Republican politicians were declaring fraud and saying theelection was stolen. While former President Donald Trump was certainly the ringleader of this gang of unpatriotic, anti-democratic ne’er-do-wells, his lackeys — like Cruz — were not far behind in the charge to undermine democracy. Cruz began questioning the electoral process on Twitter as early asNov. 4, and wasvocal about his distrustin the election results all the way up to Jan. 6, the day of the Capitol Insurrection.\nTed Cruz’s position as an elected official means his words have power. To have a politician question the American democratic process, the very thing that gave him the power he abused, is both a national embarrassment and a deadly threat. Even if Cruz did not want people to break into the Capitol, I believe he wanted them to question the legitimacy of the Biden presidency and the legitimacy of our government as a whole. By sowing uncertainty, I think he helped convince people that the world they knew was in shambles, so they rioted to take it back. His words and actions were incredibly irresponsible, and his behavior leading up to the insurrection should be enough for us Texans to want to remove him from office.\nHowever, his disgraceful behavior does not stop there. As we all know, Texas was recently hit by an arctic storm that caused millions to lose access topowerand safe drinkingwater, and even led to a number of fatal cases ofhypothermia and carbon monoxide poisoning. While many of us in Houston hunkered down, trying to conserve warmth and figure out how to cook our next meal, Ted Cruz flew to Cancun.\nIn the process of taking perhaps the most politically disastrous vacation ever, Cruz blamed hisyoung daughtersfor making him go, implied that his neighbors wereassholes, and left hisdogbehind. He is currently thelaughing stockof the U.S. Senate (which is frankly nothing new), but he is also an all-around national disgrace.\nTed Cruz has one job: to take care of the people of Texas. And while some conservatives’ arguments that he would have beenuselessin the crisis anyway are certainly compelling (after all,what has he actually donefor Texans?), at the very least he could have tried. He could have, and should have, used his connections to help connect state officials with federal disaster relief or worked to help mobilize local aid or volunteers. Instead, he decided to travel internationally in the middle of a pandemic and go relax on a beach. Meanwhile, Beto O’Rourke, who lost to Cruz in the 2018 Senate race, organized calls to check in onthousands of senior citizens, showing that he was really the one that got away.\nCruz should resign — he should have done so back in January. But when he asks for your vote in the future, don’t forget these past few months. Whether he is campaigning in the 2022 House races, his 2024 Senate (or maybe presidential) bid or for the members of his party who haveexcused,enabledandmimickedhis behavior, he has not earned our trust. Texas deserves someone who actually cares about us, or at least someone who believes in democracy and won’t continue to publicly embarrass us. That person is not Ted Cruz.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
