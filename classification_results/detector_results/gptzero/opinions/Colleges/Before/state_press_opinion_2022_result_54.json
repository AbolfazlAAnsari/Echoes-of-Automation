            "inputText": "ASU needs to better advertise its existing reproductive health care resources, in addition to making them more accessible to students across its campuses.\nIn a post-Roe landscape, access to reproductive health care options and resources on campus are more critical than ever. ASU needs to better advertise its existing reproductive health care resources, in addition to making them more accessible to students across its campuses.\nAfter the overturning of Roe v. Wade left abortion regulation to the states, the previously uncertain abortion landscape in Arizona shifted to the extreme. On Sept. 23, a Pima County judgelifted the injunctionon a law that  bans abortions after 15 weeks in all cases except when \"it is necessary to save (the mother's) life,\" with no exceptions for rape or incest.\nFor now, enforcement of the ruling is on hold after it was blocked by a three-judge panel in the Arizona Court of Appeals. This allows Planned Parenthood to resume providing abortion procedures until the courts reach a final decision.\nREAD MORE:This is what we know about where abortion rights currently stand in Arizona\nThis limbo leaves Arizona residents confused and nervous for the future. In this uncertain climate, ASU should be doing its best to provide students comfort and security through increasing student access to sexual health services.\nAccess to physical resources is limited to certain campuses, which could be in part due to misconceptions surrounding students' sexual activity.\nMelanie Buathier, education coordinator ofDevils in the Bedroomand a junior studying forensic science and biology, said these misconceptions could affect the supply of contraceptives and sex education resources across ASU campuses.\n\"In Tempe, there's this idea that Tempe students are all sexually active,\" Buathier said. \"It could be detrimental to students on other campuses because all the resources are concentrated in the Tempe campus, so the other campuses are neglected.\"\nBuathier said if the University \"thinks that Tempe is the most sexually active campus, then (they) don't really need to worry about the other campuses.\"\nAccording toSun Devils Against Sexual Assault, existing resources aren't sufficient to adequately protect students from dangerous situations like sexual violence.\nAccording to feedback SDASA collected, 90% of ASU students think ASU's Sexual and Relationship Violence Prevention program is ineffective, which is ASU's biggest resource related to reproductive justice issues. With such a large amount of students not having faith in the program's effectiveness, ASU should provide and promote confidential resources and actively seek to improve them rather than standing by.\nWhen The State Press reached out to ASU Health Services, a spokesperson provideda comprehensive list of sexual health and reproductive health care resourcesonline. The problem, then, is ASU's insufficient advertising.\n\"People don't know it exists,\" Buathier said.\nSDASA confirmed this sentiment for resources relating to sexual violence in an email to The State Press. According to its statement, rather than advertising confidential victim advocates as a first point of contact for sexual and relationship violence victims, ASU directs students to Student Advocacy and Assistance as a first point of contact, which may trigger an unwanted University investigation and potentially expose the student to retaliation.\n\"If a student tells Student Advocacy & Assistance they need help accessing contraception or abortion resources because they were sexually assaulted by another student, Student Advocacy & Assistance staff are required to report the student's disclosure to investigative offices that may initiate an investigation even if the student doesn't want an investigation to happen,\" SDASA wrote.\nThis major oversight prevents students from receiving important reproductive care, and prevents victims of sexual violence from receiving the support they need. ASU needs to prioritize both aggressively advertising and recalibrating the available resources in order for students to properly utilize them.\nASU needs to stand by itscharter, which outlines the University's \"fundamental responsibility\" for \"the overall health of the communities it serves.\"\nWith Arizona's political climate undermining the right to reproductive healthcare, ASU needs to demonstrate it firmly stands by its students, the people that make ASU's thriving community and reputation possible, and that it will do everything in its power to support victims of sexual violence.Advertising reproductive health services and making reproductive resources more effective is the first step.\nEdited by Sadie Buggle, Piper Hansen and Grace Copperthite.\nReach the columnist atmosmonbe@asu.edu.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
