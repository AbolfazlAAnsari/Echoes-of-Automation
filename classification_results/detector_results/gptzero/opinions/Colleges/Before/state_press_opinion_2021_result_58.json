            "inputText": "\"The more debt we cancel, the more money we put into the hands of college grads.” Illustration published on Sunday, Jan. 31, 2021.\nAs Joe Biden took office Jan. 20 and became the46th presidentof the U.S., he signed a flurry ofnew executive ordersand discussed plans to assuage some of the issues that have been plaguing our country for years, including student debt.\nStudent debtis an issue that perturbs college students and alumni across the country, including here at ASU. The average in-stateASU studentwill spend around$20,000-$30,000 a yearto attend ASU. This number only goes up if a student comes from out of state.\nThese numbers can leavestudents and their familiesin crippling amounts of debt. The cost of tuition is at anall-time high, and since we are in a time offinancial hardship, this can create financial struggles for students before they’ve had a chance to begin their adult life and join the workforce. Students can no longer“work their way through college”like previous generations.\nIt’s no wonder why demands tocancel student debt, freeze student loan payments and makepublic college freehave become popular among university studentsacross the country. Young people are being hit the hardest with this issue, and that isn’t considering the fact that many of us will begraduating into a recession.\nWhile campaigning, President Joe Biden announced a plan toforgive $10,000in student loans. This plan is a good start. It would make a significant dent in the debt millions of students have hanging over their heads. However, a dent may not be enough.\nMany Democrats in congress are calling for Biden to absolve up to$50,000in student debt. This amount of student loan forgiveness would definitely be preferred, as it could cut a much bigger chunk out of the$1.7 trillion in debtplaguing today’s students.\nThe average college student who owes money for their education has roughly$32,000in student debt, according to The Federal Reserve Board. If we forgave more than the median of$17,000in student loan debt, it could aid those who have higher amounts of student loan debt, including out-of-state students and middle class students who may not qualify formonetary assistance from FAFSA,or those who are not receiving financial assistance from scholarships or family members.\nMiddle class students: please I need help to pay for collegeFAFSA:pic.twitter.com/DpndkCOtKa\nWe also need to make sure that this money goes into the hands of students. We do not want anotherCARES Act situation.\nIt can takedecadesto pay back student loans. That is a lot of money to expect from someone who is justentering adulthood.\nSteven Hernandez, a senior studying journalism and mass communications, said he is currently taking a gap year from school so he's available to work, a plan that many students have takenamid the pandemic.He said that the forgiveness plan would save him a lot of time and money.\nThe government should be helping students as much as it possibly can. More jobs are expecting employees to have at leasta bachelor’s degree,when they were only required to have a high school diploma in the past.\nAdditionally,more peopleare attending college than ever before. This is a good thing because people arefurthering their education, however, we are also facing a larger financial burden. Not to mention, many of us didn't get astimulus check.\nAnother issue? Some do not believe Biden will fulfillhis promises. Were these words of sweet nothings that Biden whispered in the ears of young people sohe could get our votes? Biden needs to assuage these doubts by acting on his words quickly if he does not want to lose the support of his young audience, including those of usin Arizonawho helped him win in the first place.\nOne good order that Biden has already put into place is requesting that the Department of Education extend thestudent loan freeze, which was enacted byformer President Trump. I agree with this move, but I also hope Biden takes this time to assume an enhanced progressive stance against student debt.\nHernandez said Biden's promises so far \"open the door for similar legislation in the future, and that's something we don't want to mess with this early on.\" He thinks this bill is a step in the right direction.\nBiden has only been in office for a short amount of time, butit seems like he has gotten a lot done. He has a chance to lift a burden off of millions of young people and give them a better chance at a successful life.
