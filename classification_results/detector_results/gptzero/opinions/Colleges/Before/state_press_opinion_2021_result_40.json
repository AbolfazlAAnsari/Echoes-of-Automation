            "inputText": "\"Dear State Press, you've got mail.\" Illustration published on Friday, March 3, 2017.\nRep. Becky Nutt’s (R-Clifton)House Bill 2523would authorize Arizona’scommunity colleges to offer four-year degreesto their students. The bill passed out of the Arizona House of Representatives with onlythree representatives voting no: Rep. Charlene Fernandez (D-Yuma), Rep. César Chávez (D-Phoenix), and Rep. Pamela Powers Hannley (D-Tucson).\nThe bill is headed to the senate, and ASU students should rally behind this bill in support not only because it allows for better access to affordable higher education opportunities, but it also could make tuition more competitive at state universities.\nUniversities have become so overpriced that this bill would give people access to much needed alternatives to the three state universities: ASU, UA and NAU. Community colleges are currently at a disadvantage because they arelegally barred from offering four-year degrees, but HB 2523 would change that.\nASU’s in-state tuition for first-year students starts at$10,822. UA’s is around$12,600. NAU’s is$11,896.\nPima Community Collegecharges a base rate$1,305 for 15 credit hours, which means tuition for a full year would be just over $2,500.\nMaricopa Community Collegescharges a flat rate of$1,020 per semester, making tuition just over $2,000 annually.\nLess than $1,500 for a semester of college is much more affordable for those who are working while they are getting their education. Expansion into four-year degrees would create an explosion of education opportunities.\nAlternatively for those who are already enrolled in an Arizona university, this would hopefully create competition between state universities and community colleges.HB 2523would put community colleges at equal footing with its larger competitors when it comes to students choosing what university they want to enroll at.\nSincecommunity colleges would hold the advantage in terms of affordability, we can hope that state universities would decrease their tuition to ensure they are not missing out on prospective students to more affordable options of higher education.\nWith only three dissenting votes, the Arizona state House voted to empower community colleges to offer baccalaureate degrees. The bill now goes to the Senate.HB 2523is a phenomenal bill that every student should support, because it expands opportunities for college students and could make tuition more competitive and affordable.\nEditor’s Note: The opinions presented in this letter to the editor are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement fromThe State Press or its editors.
