Fall is my favorite season because I love the food, colors and weather. I love lighting a candle, having a chai latte and watching scary movies. The vibes are spectacular, and I wanted to share some of my favorite media to put me in the fall spirit.\nRed (Taylor’s Version)– Taylor Swift\nThe second re-recording done by Taylor Swift is one of my favorite albums of all time. This 30-song album has all the hits from her original 2012Redera, with the addition of nine bonus tracks and the 10-minute version of “All Too Well.” This album is filled with autumn references like the line, “Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,” from “All Too Well.” This album is one of my go-tos regarding lyrics and fall vibes.\nRumours– Fleetwood Mac\nThis 11-song album is full of breakup songs that have lots of angst. This album not only follows a breakup, but it is also about the heavy drug use of the band. The album was released in 1977 and made Fleetwood Mac a household name, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time and one of the best-selling albums of2022. This album reminds me of changing seasons and taking car trips to see the trees alter their colors.\nHozier– Hozier\nHozier knows how to write hauntingly beautiful songs, which is evident from his 2014 debut album. His dark lyrics, combined with the upbeat melodies, make this album perfect for a fall listen. His voice is soothing even when he is singing about death, which he frequently does in this album. This album reminds me of rainy, cool days driving to school.\n“Gilmore Girls”\n“Gilmore Girls” radiates warmth and is one of my comfort shows. I rewatch this show every fall, because it signifies the start of a new school year. The story follows Rory and Lorelai Gilmore as Rory goes through high school and college. This show is about nothing and everything at the same time. I think people rewatch it because the storyline is still prevalent today, even though it was released 20 years ago.\n“Gilmore Girls” is available to stream on Netflix.\n“Only Murders in the Building”\n“Only Murders in the Building” is one of my new favorite shows. I grew up with Selena Gomez and wanted to watch her in something other than what was offered on Disney Channel, and this show delivered. “Only Murders in the Building” is a mixture of Agatha Christie novels and true crime podcasts, and has something for everyone. It is hilarious and heartwarming, and with the murder aspect, it is a perfect show for Halloween and fall.\n“Only Murders in the Building” is available to stream on Hulu.\n“What’s New, Scooby-Doo?”\n“What’s New, Scooby-Doo?” was my favorite show growing up, and now I watch it every Halloween. It is a kid-friendly show, but I still enjoy it. The episodes are short, and it is a show you can put on while doing chores. Each episode follows the Scooby Gang solving mysteries.\n“What’s New, Scooby-Doo?” is available to stream on HBO Max.\nRELATED:OPINION: Students should not stand for white supremacy\n“Matilda”\n“Matilda” was my favorite movie as a kid, and it brought me so much joy and comfort, then and now. The film follows a girl with psychic powers trying to fit in with her rude family, and she learns to read to escape real life. This is one movie that I will never get tired of watching, especially during the fall. It radiates comfort, and the school setting makes it feel like a fall movie.\n“Matilda” is available to stream on STARZ.\n“Knives Out”\n“Knives Out” is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever watched. It is about a mystery writer who dies, and his family members are all suspects. The cast is star-studded with people like Chris Evans and Jamie Lee Curtis. The director knows how to capture and keep the audience on their toes as he creates plot twists that nobody sees coming. This movie is the perfect mystery to watch during the fall.\n“Knives Out” is available to rent or purchase on Amazon Prime Video.\n“Pride and Prejudice”\n“Pride and Prejudice” is one of my favorite period pieces, both thebookand the 2005 film. The film captures the Jane Austen book’s drama and romance, while adding a beautiful musical score. It also has thehand scene, which is one of the most distinguishable scenes in romance movies.\n“Pride and Prejudice” is available to stream on Peacock.\n“A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder” – Holly Jackson\n“A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder” follows Pip, who tries to prove Sal Singh did not murder Andie Bell five years ago for an end-of-year project. It had me on the edge of my seat and was fast-paced. This book was one of my fastest reads and one of my five-star reads last year, and its two sequels are just as good.\n“The Guest List” – Lucy Foley\n“The Guest List” was the book that got me back into reading last year. The story follows a wedding, where one person ends up dead. It has multiple points of view and several plot twists, making it a book I could not put down. It is one of the best thrillers I have read.\n“Little Women” – Louisa May Alcott\n“Little Women” follows the four March sisters – Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy – as they try to navigate childhood and womanhood. The characters are warm people and will do anything to help others. It reminds me of simpler times, without the distraction of technology, and focuses on the importance of family.\nFollow Kelly Marry onTwitter.\n\nKelly Marry (she/her) is a freshman majoring in journalism and public relations.
