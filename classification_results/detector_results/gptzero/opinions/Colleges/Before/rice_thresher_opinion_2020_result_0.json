The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors.\nThe first wave of COVID-19 erupted in the U.S.in early 2020. Rice responded quickly: During March 9-15, classes forthe week preceding Spring Break were canceled, students wereinstructed not to return to campusafter Spring Break, and instruction after Spring Break was made fully remote. This quick reaction to the pandemic wastypicalof many organizations and localities all around the country, as it becameclearthat social distancing was then the only effective way to slow down the spread of the disease. This seems to have worked and, by early May, the first wave was somewhatsubsiding. The Rice administration then tasked the Academic Restart Committee with the mission of “Return to Rice.”\nBut when President David Leebron formallyannouncedon July 17 the plans to return to campus in the fall of 2020, the second wave of COVID-19 was already raging. Against thebackdropof an alarming rise in the numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, President Leebronjustified the decisionby saying that it would “sustain our mission, and indeed achieve new heights,”andthat “we aim to provide the best educational and collegiate experience we can for students who come to our campus.” I find such statements to be weak generalities rather than a compelling rationale. In fact, I never heard the Rice administration respond explicitly to serious questions about the return-to-campus plans raised by my colleagues, ProfessorsHelena MichieandKyriacos Zygourakis, and bymyself. For example, a July 28messagefrom the President and the Provost, Reginald DesRoches, talked about “fulfilling our mission as a premier institution of higher education and research,” with no specifics of risk and benefits. Prior to the start of the semester, the Faculty Senatepassed a resolutionexpressing deep disappointment regarding pressure applied to faculty and staff to return to campus.\nThemeasuresto reduce population density on campus, limit in-person class attendance, and run an effective COVID-19 testing program on campus, combined withresponsible behaviorby Rice students, enabled Rice toavoidmajor outbreaks of COVID-19 on Campus,unlikemany other colleges. According to the New York Times college coronavirustracker, by Nov. 18, Rice had 175 cases of COVID-19. But it is important to put this in the overall context of the pandemic; when the fall semester restarted in late August 2020, the second wave of COVID-19had significantly subsided. In fact, based on the New York Times’ data, Rice’s incidence rate per capita of COVID-19 (cases divided by population), roughly 1.75 percent — while quite lower than that of our county, Harris county,roughly 4 percent— is similar to that of Rice’s zip code, 77005, which is roughly at1.7 percent.\nWhile the goal of avoiding COVID-19 outbreaks on campus was achieved, the goal of providing a “robust intellectual and social environment” for the fall semester, as wished by President Leebron in hisJuly 17 letter, was not accomplished. As Professor Michiewrotein July, “when we talk about a ‘return’ to campus, we must be clear that it is not in any sense a return.” As the semester unfolded, it became clear that dual-mode instruction is not perceived to be any better than fully-remote instruction, being essentially remote teaching in the classroom. This sentiment was, in fact, the prevailing one among bothfacultyandundergraduate studentsin surveys run by Rice’s Office of Institutional Effectiveness, and has also beenexpressedat other colleges. In fact, my observation is that Rice students have been voting with their feet; in my bi-weekly visits to campus, I have seen attendance in different classrooms decline from visit to visit. By early November, classrooms I visited during class hours were typically empty. The Rice campus I saw on my visits was practically a ghost town, fulfilling my Augustpredictionthat “it is an illusion to think that we can provide a robust in-person intellectual and social environment on campus under COVID-19.”\nEven though the semester went well at Rice in terms of COVID-19 cases, we do not have any guarantees that next semester will be the same, especially since the pandemic seems to be getting worse across the country. Since early November the third wave of the pandemic has beenrisingin the U.S., driven in certain places,some argue, to a non-negligible degree, by the (regrettable in my opinion) decision of many colleges and universities to return to campus. This third wave isdwarfingthe second wave, and Rice has also been impacted. The Rice Crisis Management Teamreported15 positive tests and a positivity rate of 0.31 percent from Nov. 3 through Nov. 9, the highest weekly positivity rate since the start of the semester. By Dec. 8, the weekly positivity rateclimbedto 0.35 percent. Margarita Rodriguez, a Rice staff member, passed away due to COVID-19 complications on Oct. 30, though it is notknownif the infection occurred on the Rice campus. Rice, as well as most other colleges and universities around the country, allowed its students to return home for Thanksgiving, a wave of air travel that arguablyfurther fueledthe third wave of the pandemic.\nLooking towards the near future, the situation isgrim. We can expect the next few months of the COVID-19 pandemic to be among “the most difficult in the public health history of this nation,”according toDr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This warning was issued even though we can expect morevigorousfederal leadership of the pandemic after the Jan. 20, 2021 inauguration of President Biden, includingaggressivevaccination plans. In this context, I was rather dismayed toreceive the notice in Novemberthat “ARC has recommended to the administration that the maximum in-person class meeting size for the Spring increase from 25 to 40, and the administration has accepted this recommendation.” The dubious rationale offered for this decision was that “both students and faculty expressed a desire for more in-person class opportunities.”\nAs the surveys clearly show, both faculty and students have a strong preference for fully in-person instruction, but not for dual-mode instruction. Thus, the assertion about “a desire for more in-person class opportunities” in the context of increasing maximum in-person class meeting size for the Spring increase from 25 to 40 is rather misleading, since such larger classes would surely be taught in a dual mode.\nI stand by myjudgmentfrom August that the Rice administration's decision to return to campus in the fall risked health and life for questionable educational benefit. But just because we were lucky does not mean we were smart; we dodged a bullet in the fall, but we may not dodge it again in the spring. The decision to return to campus in the springandincrease population density on campus, in view of the raging pandemic and the manifestly dubious educational value of dual-mode delivery,simply cannot be justified. It is worth remembering thewordsfrom last March of the presidents of Harvard, MIT and Stanford: “Taking difficult steps now, for the public good, will mean getting back to normal in the future with fewer friends and colleagues to mourn.”\nMoshe Y. Vardi is a University Professor and the Karen Ostrum George Distinguished Service Professor of Computational Engineering.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
