I’m usually a busy person who likes to do a million things at once. Being stuck in my room (the place I rent doesn’t even have a living room) has been a challenge. I can’t even borrow a book from the library or go shopping at Indigo! However, I do know that play, and having fun, is something important, so I try my best to incorporate daily positive experiences. Increasing positive emotions by creating pleasant experiences is a strategy that will help you in many ways.\nFor me, having fun is somewhat a hard thing to do. But it’s a coping skill that will help you regulate your emotions. It will increase feel-good hormones in your body, allow you to create meaningful memories and remind yourself that there is hope out there.\nI invite you to do one thing per day that will increase your positive emotions, whatever that may be. Keep in mind that simple pleasures, although simple, can create an immediate and long-lasting effect on your mood. The activities you choose do not have to be over the top or too complicated.\nRemember, building positive experience now is like accumulating coins in a piggy bank. Those positive memories will help you in times of hardship, for example, when devastating life events take away those precious coins. It’s important to be mindful and stay in the present while doing these activities.\nThings I have done over the past week include:\nHere are some other ideas you could try:\nThat’s all I can think of for now! I highly recommend trying something new this week, because after all, what else are you going to do? Cheers and take care.\nThe authors of this column are not mental health professionals.
