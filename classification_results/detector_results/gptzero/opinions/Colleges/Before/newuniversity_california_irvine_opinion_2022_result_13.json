As a half-Mexican man myself, I also understand that “Latino” does not inherently exclude women or nonbinary people. This doesn’t mean the Spanish language cannot adapt to reflect the major changes in how our society views gender in modern times.\nOther options like “Latino/a” and “Latin@” are not only even more impossible to pronounce, but  fail to provide the gender inclusivity of the previously mentioned terms. Terms like “Latin@” erase non-binary identities — it’s like saying “his or hers” instead of simply saying “theirs.” Using either of these terms is more difficult than using “Latinx.”\nAt this point, non-Hispanic peoples’ usage of “Latinx” is performative due to its high unpopularity with Hispanic people themselves. People like Biden and academic institutions thatcontinueto use “Latinx” do so in an attempt to project a socially conscious image, but are actually displaying their lack of awareness on the issue. “Latine” is a better gender-neutral alternative, but it seems that the non-Hispanic people who use “Latinx” are too disconnected from the Hispanic community to realize it.\nDaniel Waters is an Opinion Apprentice for the spring 2022 quarter.
