While we all have ambitious goals for a second term, we want to share what we’ve accomplished during our first term.We want to underscore the importance of reelecting senators who already have worked closely with the administration. During our first term, it was necessary to spend at least half of our term learning about the inner-workings of the University. This time, we hope to hit the ground running right at the beginning of our term with our vision and goals for the Senate and the ASSU as a whole: building relationships with key stakeholders, conserving institutional knowledge, affecting a culture shift, developing a bureaucracy and providing leadership development.\nEmergency support during COVID-19\nSexual violence prevention and survivor support\nEducational reform\nMental health\nSupporting VSOs and student activist movements\nManaging funding for VSOs\nSincerely,\nMià Bahr ’22, parliamentarian (she/her/hers), endorsed by SOCC\nMicheal Brown ’22, appropriations committee member (he/him/his):platform, endorsed by SOCC, Daily, and FLIP\nKobe Hopkins ’22, treasurer (he/him/his), endorsed by SWR\nJonathan Lipman ’21, Faculty Senate representative (he/him/his):platform, endorsed by SOCC, Daily and FLIP\nTim Vrakas ’21, appropriations committee chair (he/him/his), endorsed by The Daily\nAn earlier version of this stated that Senator Lipman worked with Stanford Womxn in Law and The Stanford Eugenics Project to bring concerns to the Faculty Senate. These concerns were brought to the Senate not the Faculty Senate.
