The plan has proven to be successful so far — we have been able to keep our COVID-19 case count low, especially in comparison tomany other universitiesacross the country. Our case numbers may reflect the administration’s thorough planning, but they also reflect the caution and cooperation that everyone on campus has exercised  over the past six weeks. Things seem to be going well, so we implore everyone at Rice: don’t let up now.\nBetween Sept. 8 and Sept. 14, Rice had its first week since starting classes this semester without a single positive test. This was fantastic news, and everyone who played a part in that should be proud, but in no way does that mean we can begin to relax when it comes to following physical distancing protocols. As we all know, that is not how COVID-19 works. The numbers prove it: Between Sept. 15 and Sept. 25, 11 people tested positive.\nThis slight increase in cases is still low, and we have no way of knowing whether these new infections are a result of individuals relaxing their own safety protocols due to low case numbers. However, we think it is worth reminding everyone, and ourselves, that the pandemic is still a very real threat, especially when certain safety protocols around us are lifted. On Sept. 17, Dean of Undergraduates Bridget Gorman announced that she is partially lifting the ban on alcohol consumption on campus by allowing colleges to host public, outdoor events with alcohol service. As students begin to attend such events, it is imperative that we remember that other safety protocols — such as a maximum of 50 people allowed at an event, mandatory mask-wearing and a required six feet of distance between people — have not been lifted.\nThese safety protocols are only mandatory within the confines of Rice’s campus. Beyond 6100 Main St., Texas Governor Greg Abbott hascontinued to loosen restrictionsfor the state, recently allowing retail stores, restaurants, office buildings and more to expand from 50 to 75 percent capacity. Students must account for how higher capacity translates to higher risk for the same activity and adjust our behavior accordingly. As Rice students inevitably engage with the greater Houston area, we must keep not only the safety of the Rice community, but the safety of Houstonians at the forefront of our minds. We have the privilege of weekly testing and readily available isolation housing on the Rice campus, but the same can not be said for the rest of Houston. Houston might be in much better shape than it was over the summer, but COVID-19 is still alive and well in the city, and the potentially irresponsible actions of Rice students could have effects that ripple well beyond our campus. In other words, just because you can eat indoors at a restaurant doesn’t mean you should.\nAll of us must hold both ourselves and our peers accountable when it comes to following safety protocols and the Culture of Care Agreement. Chief Justices and Public Health Ambassadors should not be the only students who confront violators or serve as public health role models. Irresponsible actions will undoubtedly put an in-person spring semester in jeopardy, but more importantly place a dangerous burden on the Houston community and on those who do not have an elite university looking after them.\nEditor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Rishab Ramapriyan, Ivanka Perez, Amy Qin, Elizabeth Hergert, Ella Feldman, Katelyn Landry, Rynd Morgan, Savannah Kuchar, Ben Baker-Katz, Simona Matovic and Tina Liu.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
