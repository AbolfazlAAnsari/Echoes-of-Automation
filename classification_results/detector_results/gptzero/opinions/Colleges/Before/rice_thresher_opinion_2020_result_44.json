The views expressed in this opinion are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors.\nRice tour guides tell the beloved story of Wiessmen who successfullyturned Willy’s statue 180 degreesand recite the chilling legend of William Marsh Rice’sforged will and peculiar murder.Undergrads relay tales of drunken statue climbs or late-night urination:pee on Will Ricecan mean the residential collegeorthe monument. Students have rallied underneath Willy’s statue to distribute political campaign stickers, honor victims ofislamophobiaandantisemitismandraise awarenessof campus sexual violence.\nThe roles the statue plays for today’s students, from pranks to protests, result from years of Willy’s ingraining into campus culture and revision into a friendly, esteemed namesake. The complicity of the university in this process, however, conceals the sinister history of the man depicted: William Marsh Rice.\nWilliam Marsh Ricemade moneyby profiting off the cotton trade and providing loans to local slave owners in the mid-1800s, in addition to enslaving at least15 individualsin his lifetime. And he did not stop at profiting from slavery — he also served on aHouston slave patrol. When 30-year-old slave Merinda escaped, he offered a “liberal rewardfor her apprehension and delivery” in the Houston Telegraph.\nWilliam Marsh Rice preserved white supremacist views in Rice’scharter, declaring the school to be an institution for “white inhabitantsof the city of Houston and the state of Texas.” In 1964, Rice was one of the last southern private schools todesegregate. However, the abhorrent treatment of Black students doesn’t end there. Examinations of past yearbooks reveal the embedding of racism into student life. Photos from the 1920s display Rice’s own Ku Klux Klanchapter. The 1988 Campanile showsstudents wearing blackfaceat a party.\nRacist aggressions from Rice’s past exist today as well, proven byn-wordusage,students dressing as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agentsand campusracial profiling. Willy’s continued presence at the heart of campus signals that these instances are not discouraged: the racism at their root reflects William Marsh Rice’s beliefs towards Black individuals. Our modern values ⁠— an all-encompassing “Culture of Care”⁠— are not consistent with those by which William Marsh Rice lived or the university’s founding principles.\nThrough the statue and use of Willy’s image in marketing, Rice University glorifies a racist who barred Black students from education. Willy is described as a gracious figure who left his earnings for the university. The name “Willy” colors the statue withaffectionand friendship. Official Rice social mediarefers to Willyhumorously, sharing images of the statue being fitted with acowboy hat, sporting aHalloween pumpkinand appearing in a frame ofPokemon Go. OneInstagram posteven begs its audience to consider whether “Willy” would be “a pumpkin spice latte kind of guy.” To not only display the statue, but to treat it with humor for public relations is unforgivable. This goofy and kind “Willy” figure does not exist and never has. Posthumously labeling some slave owners as “good” obscures the evil inherent to slaveholding itself.\nIndividuals clutching their pearls at the thought of removing the statue argue that erasing its presence “erases history.” They claim that the statue tells of William Marsh Rice’s faults and accomplishments. Nothing about “Willy” reveals the violence integral to his life and fortune, and the university has done a poor job of acknowledging it, too. The statue lacks a formal plaque to inform us that here lies a slave owner, and tour guides are not trained to disclose this either.\nMany have tried, but history cannot be erased or revised. Regardless of whether ahistorical figurehas a statue, we remember them throughother means, namely education, which Rice must facilitate. Statues are not meant to teach events. They are constructed to honor the memory of those depicted. Like all slave owners, William Marsh Rice is not worth reverence.\nThose who claim that removal of the statue is disrespectful should argue with students who have climbed on Willy, peed on Willy or covered it in Baker 13 shaving cream. Do you really care about respect? Or are you deflecting from the pertinent issue: thewellbeing of Black Rice students? For them, the looming figure in the Academic Quad is a source of racial trauma, a reminder that they were never intended to be there. A true Culture of Care must weigh thepsychological impactsofselective historical amnesiaandgaslightingon Black students, implicit in the supposedly benevolent presence of William Rice’s statue, more heavily than the preservation of revisionist history and tradition.\nWe call on administration to immediately remove Willy from all current and future merchandising and marketing campaigns. Remove the statue from the Academic Quad and accurately contextualize all references to William Marsh Rice. Acknowledging the shameful history of William Marsh Rice with no further action is performative at best and callous at worst.\nBlack students do not owe anything to a man who enslaved their kin, nor to an administration and a largely non-Black student body that have inadvertently and directly incited racism. Rather, Rice administrators owe Black students the same safety and support given to privileged student populations on campus. This cannot be achieved so long as space is shared with the statue of a slave owner.\nAfter 50 years of decadence, Wiess College’s infamous underwear party is no more. \nBorn in the early 1970s after a group of Wiess students poured all their alcohol into a bathtub — creating a brew “so potent it removed the varnish” — Night of Decadence has spent years in the national eye. Allegedly recognized as one of Playboy’s top college parties in the nation, NOD has also been subject to mounting scrutiny over alcohol use and an “explicitly dangerous and sexual atmosphere.”\nRice has now permanently canceled the public, Dean of Undergraduates Bridget Gorman and Wiess magister Flavio Cunha announced in a message to campus June 5.\nRice Mutual Aid launched a fundraising campaign for Gaza on May 13 in partnership with 15 other student organizations at Rice, including Rice Students for Justice in Palestine, Rice Pride, the Hispanic Association for Cultural Enrichment at Rice and the Rice Muslim Student Association. RMA will direct donations towards American Near East Refugee Aid, a non-governmental organization that provides humanitarian aid and emergency relief in Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan. A day after its launch, the campaign raised over $2,000 according to RMA’s Instagram.\nThe Jones Graduate School of Business will expand its building, constructing an additional 95,000 square feet around McNair Hall. Rice Business announced blueprint plans for the new $54.5 million building at its groundbreaking May 9. The new building will include multiple large classrooms, lecture halls, dining facilities, event spaces and communal areas, designed to “blend seamlessly with the campus and its surroundings.”\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
