            "inputText": "Abolish Stanford is an autonomous formation fighting for police abolition and total liberation at Stanford University and across the peninsula. Through direct action, county-level advocacy, political education and base-building, we are committed to defunding the police and reinvesting resources towards community and institutions that actually keep us safe.The group’s members have asked to remain anonymous for fear of university retaliation.\nOn Thursday, March 26, the Santa Clara County Community Correction and Law Enforcement Monitoring Committee (CCLEM)metto consider recommendations relating to the Sheriff’s Office Military Equipment Use Policy. UnderAssembly Bill 481,law enforcement agencies are required to receive approval from their local governing body for the acquisition and continued use of military equipment. Among the military items and uses that the Sheriff’s Office wants approved are: continued use of 280 Colt AR-15 and other assault and sniper rifles, a new $465,000 robot (on top of the three robots already in inventory) and unrestricted use of “less lethal” (i.e. rubber bullets) and chemical munitions, according to the meetingagenda. This list does not include the inventory within the Stanford University Department of Public Safety’s (SUDPS) possession.According to the agenda,SUDPS alone has 32 Colt AR-15 rifles and eight Defense Technology 40mm Launchers for “less lethal” munitions, among other items.\nAs the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) pointed out during the meeting, these types of militarized equipment do not keep communities safe: they exacerbate the threat posed to Black and Brown communities due to already existing disparities in policing, and they do not keep communities safe. Studies show that they fail toreduce crimeand/orattacks on police, but that theydoincreasetheamount of violencecommunities face at thehands of police.\nThe AFSC also pointed out that the Sheriff’s Office proposed Military Equipment Use Policy violates state and county law.Assembly Bill 48prohibits the use of kinetic energy projectiles (i.e. “less lethal” munitions) and chemical agents to disperse any assembly, protest or demonstration except under very specific circumstances (such as threat to life or of severe bodily injury). And perhaps most importantly, the Military Equipment Use Policy places few to no restrictions on its use of militarized equipment. There are no explicit prohibitions on use of any of these items, nor are there real limitations (most uses are defined as “including, but not limited to”).\nDespite these deficiencies and community concerns, the Sheriff’s Office argued that this military equipment is needed to respond to incidents like the 2021 VTA shooting in San Jose. Indeed,police often invokemass shootings as a justification for their militarization, as well as their very existence. Unfortunately, in the past few weeks, we’ve seen multiple times just how empty the promise of safety through militarized police forces truly is. In Uvalde, TX, a gunman killed 19 children and two adults at a local elementary school. It’s difficult to imagine a more disastrous police response: the gunman was inside the school for around80 minutes,roughly50 of whichinvolved 19 police officers waiting inside a school hallway, refusing to confront the lone gunman. Federal marshals and Uvalde Police Department officersreserved their violencefor family members urging action: one woman was briefly handcuffed, a father was thrown to the ground by an officer, another was pepper-sprayed and another was tasered. Meanwhile, students trapped inside made at leastseven 911 callsbegging police — who they could hear right outside — for help. Ultimately, it took a separate law enforcement agencyreceiving a key from a school janitorbefore the gunman was killed and children were able to leave.\nThe knee-jerk response to tragedies like this is to call for more police funding. But that would make a mockery of the people who lost loved ones in recent weeks in the face of police incompetence. Uvalde spends40% of its budgeton police and hasmore than doubledthe amount it spends on school policing since 2017, from roughly $200,000 to $435,000. In Buffalo, NY, a 911 dispatcherhung up the phoneon an employee trapped in the grocery store attacked by a white supremacist gunman. New York Cityincreasedthe amount of law enforcement dedicated to the subway system by 250 officers last May, only for theNYPD to failto prevent the attack or apprehend the gunman.\nWe havedecades’ worthof similar examples of police failure in the context of mass shootings. We also know that in the two years since George Floyd was murdered, police have gone to kill over2,000 more people, or aboutthree people per day.Whether we want to admit it or not,we are living in a death cult, in no small part due to this country’s obsession with police. As writer, lawyer and activist Derecka Purnell writes in “Becoming Abolitionists,” “[S]tructural violence, like militarism and policing, can create and shape interpersonal violence, like assaults, murders and mass shootings . . . . Plainly put, when the federal government uses law enforcement and the military to control concentrated wealth, property and natural resources, they condition everyday people to accept the violence, replicate it or rebel against it.” We must be among those who rebel against it.\nWe must work to end policing, war and militarization here and around the globe. And there’s plenty we can do locally to be part of this struggle:\nA better world is possible, but not while the state increases its investment in death and destruction, at the expense of community resources and care. We cannot allow these recent, devastating tragedies to be used as an excuse to expand the militarized police state. We need abolition now.\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and  letters to the editor. We’d love to hear your thoughts.
