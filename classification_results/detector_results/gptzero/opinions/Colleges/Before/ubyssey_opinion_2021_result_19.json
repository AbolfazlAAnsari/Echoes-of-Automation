There is absolutely no public health justification for this decision, which will in fact exacerbate the negative health effects of COVID-19 on young adults. These UBC professors — and others who would follow suit — need to acknowledge  the toll these personally-motivated decisions have on the students of UBC.\nTo say moving classes to online learning does not follow public health guidance is an understatement — it actively contradicts the work of public health professionals. Ateam of experts from the post-secondary sector, alongside the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC), the Provincial Health Officer and other regional health authorities developed aset of guidelinesto ensure that post-secondary institutions facilitate a safe return in-person classes. The BCCDC, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Advanced Education have been working for months to ensure that post-secondary institutions return in-person, and have taken every step to establish asafe return to campus.\nThe vast majority of the permanent UBC Vancouver population isalready vaccinated(86 per cent age 12+ has at least one dose as of September 2).  Asurvey conducted by UBCestimated that the vast majority of the UBC students are vaccinated (92 per cent of the 16,093 respondents had at least one dose) and those numbers will presumably continue to rise asvaccine passports are implemented, which makes campus a safer place for students to return.\nStudents will all either have to be fully vaccinated orundergo rapid COVID testingto prove they are free of infection. There have been very few COVID-19 hospitalizations for double vaccinated people in BC aged 20-29 this entire summer, according to page 19 of theBCCDC’s August 26 data summary. The health risk for UBC students returning to campus is as low as it possibly can be.\nMany professors have been eager to vocalizetheir anxietiesabout returning to campus. Understandably, many professors are in older age groups, which have historically seenmore serious consequenceswhen exposed to the virus responsible for COVID-19. But they too are as low-risk as possible. Lecture podiums are physically distanced from students, buildings are ventilated and everyone will be wearing masks. These measures have beensupported by public health authoritiesduring this pandemic. To put it in perspective, professors will have a similar risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus buying groceries or commuting.\nMoving back to virtual learning also completely disregards the documented negative impacts of COVID-19 on youth in BC. The BCCDC reported that young adults are twice as likely as people above the age of 65 to reportworsened mental healthduring the pandemic. Young adults are also the mostaffected age group for unemployment,setting an all-time record high in BC. Young adults need to return to in-person learning for their health and wellbeing.\nThe decision to move classes online has been based on the opinions of individual professors, not public health officials. It is understandable that professors would be concerned about returning to in-person class — many students are as well — but these concerns do not follow the research and continued work of our public health sector.\nPublic health research has shown that COVID-19 israrely transmitted in the classroom. Research has shown thatvaccines are extremely effectiveagainst COVID, including the Delta variant.Public health officials supportpost-secondary institutions’ return to in-person learning — now is the time to follow this guidance, as we have done previously with physical distancing or vaccine recommendations.\nIt is unfathomable that professors would announce a switch to virtual learning one week before school starts. Affected students at UBCO and UBCV have moved and invested thousands of dollars in housing (and parking passes). They have left their jobs assuming that class would be in-person. They have left their families, their friends and their homes all in the name of their education.\nUBC told students to drastically change their lives toaccommodate in-person learning, which they did. Manyinternational studentsespecially have gone to great lengths to attend UBC. Now they give some students one week’s notice that they have decided to give some students one week’s notice that they have decided to renege their promise of in-person learning, even though the transition to on-campus instruction was supported by public health officials. One week’s notice is not enough for students to change their plans for the fall semester. One week’s notice feels dismissive of everything students have gone through to get to UBC. One week’s notice is not acceptable.\nUniversities in BC have treated themselves like they’re special for the last eighteen months. Nothing else shut down to the same extent as research universities. Kindergarten to grade 12 schools remained safely in-person, either entirely or partially. Many people stayed employed in-person through service positions or other work that was deemed essential, like teachers and nurses. People have been safely interacting in-person for much of the pandemic. Why are post-secondary institutions treated any differently now that we know it’s safe to return to campus?\nIt will do nothing but harm students’ mental and financial wellbeing to switch back to virtual learning now. BC public health officials support universities’ return to in-person learning. The faculty and staff of UBC must carry out this recommendation for the wellbeing of UBC students, and to uphold its purpose as an educational institution. It is time to listen to what the students and health officials are rightfully supporting, and go back to school in-person.\nCarter Dungate is a fourth-year Honours English Literature and International Relations student.
