            "inputText": "OnFeb. 24,2022, RussianPresident Vladimir Putinbegan a \"special military operation\" intending to launch a full-scale invasion into Ukraine. The situation in Ukraine is going from bad to worse as the Ukrainian people are fighting hard to resist the Russian military and are putting their lives on the line to defend their freedom and their country.\nWhile the situation has been tense for Ukrainians in Eastern Europe, things have also been difficult for Ukrainian students, staff and faculty at ASU. ASU officials have reached out to Ukrainian students to offer to help them in any way possible, however, some students said the aid hasn’t been adequate and has failed to address some of the issues they face.\n“Firstly, I would like to state that I don’t agree with this being a mere crisis. It is a full-fledged war,\" said Valeriia Starosek, an international student from Ukraine and senior studying computer science. Starosek expressed her strong displeasure with the use of words like “crisis” and “conflict” instead of “war,” as she feels that these terms tend to dilute the truth and leads to a lack of understanding among others who are not directly affected by it.\n\nStarosek said her mental health has been suffering. She explained how back in Ukraine, her family has had to relocate, but couldn’t cross the border to Poland because her stepfather needs to stay back and volunteer, as Ukraine has banned male citizens between the age of 18 and 60 from leaving thecountry to defend Ukraine.She said she facessurvivor’sguilt as she feels in a position of privilege to be in a safe space here in the U.S.\nMykhaylo Mykhaylov, a freshman from Ukraine studying computer science, said “waking up every day to devastating news from Ukraine, dealing with the stress that it brings throughout the day while tending to my academic commitments has been difficult.\" Mykhaylov has been unable to sleep on time, partly to be able to talk to his family, because Ukraine is nine hours ahead of Arizona, and partly because of stress from listening to the news.\nThe war has affected these students’ day-to-day lives in the U.S. Students from Ukraine have been facing difficulties with their housing and piling debt, as their families back home have had a loss of livelihood and property as they relocate.\nFamilies have less money, not just for themselves but also to support their children studying abroad, and nobody knows what the economy will look like going forward. Not to mention, therecenttuition increases as proposed byASUPresident Michael Crow exacerbate existing financial concerns.\nASU has taken some steps to aid the students. Mykhaylov and Starosek said they received some emails from the Dean of Students, from theInternational Students and Scholars Centerand some professors who have offered academic arrangements, temporary financial aid and access to counseling services at ASU.\nThe students want to have more help in terms of tuition, rent and better wages for on-campus jobs to make ends meet, and ASU could be doing more to aid them in this regard.\nThere should be support groups and community support made available to Ukrainian students so that they can make sense of the struggles they're facing, concentrate on their academics better or get any other help with mental health issues that they may seek.\n\nStarosek said she hopes ASU provides services like flexible assignment deadlines, access to recorded lectures and other such academic or scheduling adjustments across the board for all Ukrainian students to ease stress in these areas when their necessities like food and shelter are in jeopardy.\nShe called for unity among Ukrainians and the international community to help each other in times of need. She said that in Ukrainian culture, it is always preferable to try and fix things themselves instead of asking for help, but she wants to emphasize the fact that these times are unprecedented and people should not hesitate to ask for help.\nNow more than ever, these students need help and support from the University, from the government, and the community, including the community of international students studying at ASU. Volunteer for organizations that are trying to support them. It is upon us to support them and show them that they are not alone.\nReach out to theInternational Students and Scholars Centerat 480-727-4776 orissc@asu.edu, or the Dean of Students Office atdeanofstudents@asu.eduand ask for the help you need.\nDonate to support families affected by the crisis in Ukraine through UNICEFhere.\nEditor's Note:A previous version of this story was published with a header illustration that did not accurately represent the borders of Ukraine.
