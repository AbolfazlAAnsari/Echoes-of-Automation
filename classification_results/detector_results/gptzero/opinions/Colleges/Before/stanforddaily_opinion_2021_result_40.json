At the same time, we have heard the concerns of advocates and are already in active discussions with the County to jointly address those concerns — including a new, complete and dedicated suite for survivors of sexual assault. We will submit our proposal to the County Board of Supervisors Health and Hospital Committee later this month.\nStanford Health Care’s emergency medicine physicians and staff are devoted to providing the highest standard of compassionate care — which requires that we always remain open and humble to feedback and dedicated to continuous improvement. We care for survivors of every age, gender and level of acuity, and deeply understand and care about the unique experience of each patient. We recognize the importance of a program and process tailored specifically for survivors.\nIn my career, I have cared for countless survivors of trauma, including many survivors of sexual assault. I have worked with our program leaders and the Santa Clara County SAFE Program leadership to develop our SAFE response location, which opened in February 2020, with the goal of providing the safest, most compassionate care to survivors of sexual assault, including by providing a physical setting equipped to meet their medical and emotional needs.\nAt Stanford Health Care, responding to the past 16 months of unprecedented surges and patient needs during the pandemic has reinforced our devotion to our community. We adapted, grew and persevered to meet our community’s diverse needs and will do the same as we are hearing from our community regarding our SAFE response location. Our objective is to hear feedback humbly and openly and to do our very best to respond with meaningful action. General feedback from non-patients may be emailed toSAFEfeedback@stanfordhealthcare.org. Patients should email concerns toguestservices@stanfordhealthcare.org. Please note that anyone in need of SAFE services should go directly to the emergency department and not send a message through email.\nAlthough our program meets all the stringent requirements and protocols for maintaining evidence as a necessary part of the evidence-collection process, we are determined to make the experience for survivors as strong as it can possibly be. Nothing less will do. At this time, our recent conversations with the SCVMC SAFE Program leaders include the following plans in development, as referenced in theJuly 30 Off-Agenda Report on SAFE Response Locationssubmitted to the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors Health and Hospital Committee by the County’s SAFE Program.\nFurther details about our proposal for a new, dedicated suite cannot be provided here until they have been presented to the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors Health and Hospital Committee later this month. The Health and Hospital Committee meetings occur monthly, and new information will be provided at each meeting. We expect to share our timeline subsequently.\nAs these improvements take shape in the coming weeks and months, we will do everything to continue to ensure that survivors of sexual assault experience the best possible, safe, supportive environment for SAFE exams at Stanford Health Care.\n— Andra Blomkalns\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and  letters to the editor.
