            "inputText": "In late April, an anti-abortion bill was signed into Arizona law by Gov. Doug Ducey.This bill,Senate Bill 1457, makes it illegal for doctors to perform abortions on women due to genetic abnormalities.\nThe bill would make it illegal to perform an abortion due to the fetus having conditions such as cystic fibrosis and Down syndrome. Abortions of this nature will only be legal if the mother’s life is at risk. Of course, whether or not the mother's life will be at risk financially or psychologically is not considered.\nDoctors and attorneys warnedDucey this action would be unconstitutional and would go against standard medical practices, but heignoredthe advice andsignedit anyway.\nFor those who would argue that the mother could put the child up for adoption, there are alreadymore than 400,000children in foster care in the U.S. Many of these children faceabuse or neglect, and considering the fact that people with disabilitiesreport abuse more frequently,the future is not looking so bright for any child with a disability who was born against the mother's wishes and placed into foster care.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court announced in May its decision to hear a case that could potentially reverse the 1973 decision onRoe v. Wade, which granted the constitutional right to abortions across the nation. With the court's new 6-3 conservative majority, this poses another threat to the right to safe and legal abortions.\n\"When you ban abortion, you are banning safe and legal abortion. Illegal and unsafe abortions are still going to take place,\" said Mary Rothschild, a retired professor inWomen and Gender Studiesat ASU. \"Wealthy women are always going to have access to abortion due to their connections. Low-income women are the ones being put at risk.\"\nLow-income womenare less able to take time off work and travel long distances to receive an abortion. This issue is being exacerbated by abortion restrictions, as fewer women will have access to them.\nWith less access to abortion, women aremore likelyto drop out of college due to a lack oftime and money. A2017 reportby the Institute for Women's Policy Research showed that single mothers are less likely to finish college when compared to their peers. This would be taking steps back, bringing us further fromgender equalityin education and in the workplace.\n\"Many college students are sexually active, and these new laws will affect them,\" Rothschild said. \"These kids, oftentimes, aren't consistently using birth control, and even if they are, no form of birth controlis 100% effective.\"\nShe suggested students use a reliable form of birth control to reduce the likelihood of finding themselves in a predicament where they are unable to have an abortion. ASU has aSexual Wellness Centerand providesfree condomsat health centers on all four campuses.\nRothschild saidstaying politically active and contacting local and staterepresentativesare essential to make your voice heard. Voting, protesting and petitioning are very powerful tools. It may also affect your future in these types of situations. It is important that, in the future, Arizonans and Americans elect officials who will protect abortion rights and reproductive health care for all who need it.\nASU students and officials need to take a stance against this bill. President Michael Crow needs to put his students first. Student groups, includingPlanned Parenthood Generation Action at ASUandYoung Democrats at ASU,are already condemning Crow for his silence.\nThis law and future threats are going to affect the student body, especially women and low-income students who cannot afford to raise a child.\nReach the columnist athtenore@asu.eduor follow@haleyyhmton Twitter.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
