But, Senate can often be hard to understand for the average student, and theagenda docketcan be super long and dull to read.\nSenate Recentred is written by members of the Student Senate Caucus to demystify Senate by giving students a snapshot of what Senate is doing this month.\nHere’s what to expect at the December 14 Senate meeting.\nSeveral changes are up for approval for this Senate meeting. Here’s a snapshot of a few of them:\nAt tonight's meeting, the Nominating Committee will seek to approve three Senate members to join the President’s Advisory Committee for the Selection of a Vice-Provost and Associate Vice-President, Teaching and Learning. The position is currently held by Dr. Simon Bates.\nThe University Librarian, Susan Parker, is presenting a recap of all notable library achievements and improvements over the 2021/22 academic year. The achievements are split into sections: advance research and scholarship; engaging with community; create and deliver responsive collections; inspire with innovative spaces and services; and steward the organization.\nSome highlights include:\nThe Provost, Gage Averill, released theExternal Reviews of Academic Unitsat UBC Vancouver for the 2021/22 academic year. An external review committee determined key findings and makes recommendations to the university.\nAverill also released a memo that summarized the agreement between UBC and the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies (PWIAS). The Vancouver Senate approved the creation of the Wall Fellowships and Research Awards programs at its October 19 meeting.\nThe Wall Fellowships and Awards will be funded by the Peter Wall Legacy Fund (formerly known as the Peter Wall Endowment). Each year, the fund will support two fellowships and a number of research awards for UBC faculty members and students, totalling approximately $4 million each year. Awards and fellowships will be committed to research that focuses on sustainability, at least for an initial period.\nThis agreement “leaves the future” of the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies “explicitly in the hands of the Vancouver Senate.” Funding for current benefitting PWIAS scholars remains intact until August 31, 2023. Another academic committee, with input from the Vancouver Senate, will consider the future of the PWIAS as well as the desirability for an institute for advanced studies here at UBC.\nUBC will also be creating the Wall Collaboration Centre, a space to serve members of the UBC community, Wall Fellows and Wall Research Awardees.\nThe committee is bringing candidates forward for the first time since honorary degrees where halted last year to focus on therevocationof Bishop John O'Grady's degree.\nThis session is in-camera, which means that it is private and contents cannot be shared outside of the Senate meeting.\nHajidazeh is a third-year international relations student,senator at-large and Student Senate Caucusco-chair. Yu is a fifth-year integrated sciences student and the Faculty of Sciencestudent senator. Yu is in her second term as a senator.\nIf you have any questions for your student senators, you can reach out to the SSC by emailing Student Senate Caucus co-chair Laia Shpeller atlaia.shpeller@ubc.caor Hajizadeh atromihajizadeh@gmail.com.\nSenate Recentredis a column written by members of the Student Senate Caucus to demystify senate from the inside out.\nShare this articlecopied!\nRomina Hajizadehauthor\nKeanna Yuauthor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
