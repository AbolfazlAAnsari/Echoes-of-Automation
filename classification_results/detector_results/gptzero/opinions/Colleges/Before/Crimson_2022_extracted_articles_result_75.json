Now, let’s consider the reverse: You’re telling me that all this time, 77 percent of MPA/ID students may have been referred to by an incorrect rendition of their name?\r\nOn Oct. 13, 2021, Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf announced the latest updates on Diversity, Equity, and Anti-Racism initiatives, stating that, “Our core values call on us as well to oppose racism and other systemic injustices, using our skills and energies to help build a world with respect and dignity for all.” While this statement and its associated pragmatic efforts are valuable in demonstrating the institution’s commitment to inclusion, it seems reasonable to request that faculty and the administration act upon this higher-level aspiration towards anti-racism by first doing the bare minimum: using the tool that they created in order to say students’ names — specifically, non-anglicized names — correctly.\r\nWhen it comes to practical interactions, microaggressions in the classroom continue to harm students with non-anglicized names, who often belong to under-represented racial and ethnic identities. For example, following the introduction of theTeachlyplatform — which enables professors to get to know students through self-provided learning profiles, including information about backgrounds, interests, and first languages — within HKS in 2017, even the professors who proudly announce their use of this platform cannot help their own bias against certain students with non-anglicized names. Despite the fact that my first language on Teachly is documented as English, I still receive comments on my policy papers such as, “I'm very impressed at how effective your exposition is, given that you're not writing in your first language.” Further, even though my Teachly profile includes little to no information — other than my name — that would insinuate my foreignness to Americans, I receive feedback such as, “Really good! Impressed with your grasp of US politics.”\r\nComments like these lead me to wonder: who belongs in the Harvard community as an “American?” Even if you can write and speak proficient English, and understand U.S. politics, others perceive a non-anglicized name as a sign that you are a “foreigner.” If the professor in this case had used the Teachly platform to check their biased assumptions, I might have received constructive academic feedback, like my fellow American peers with “American-sounding” names. We students with non-anglicized names do not pay the Harvard tuition to get complimented for our effective exposition in English or to impress our professors with our grasp of U.S. politics.\r\nNaysayers are often quick to diminish the progressive significance of name pronunciation, but the effects of name mispronunciation go beyond a negative personal experience. Within the Harvard community, learners with non-anglicized names may be overlooked for academic opportunities and regularly feel diminished by people in power, all while Harvard insists on its desire to include diverse perspectives.\r\nHarvard’s pedagogical commitment to learn from diverse perspectives holds performative weight, especially when the most user-friendly and pragmatic of steps are brushed aside by nearly all professors. Practicing a willingness to listen — literally, to listen to recordings of name pronunciation — brings the Harvard community closer to providing equitable opportunities for learners of all backgrounds, and into the mindset that every earnest step taken towards anti-racism is one worth taking.\r\nSunghea Khil is a third-year joint Master in Public Policy and Urban Planning student at the Harvard Kennedy School and the Harvard Graduate School of Design."
