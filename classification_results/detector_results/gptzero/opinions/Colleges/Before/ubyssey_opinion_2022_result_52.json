            "inputText": "Oct. 25, 2022\nWritten byUbyssey Editorial Board\nThe AMS is not practicing good governance.\nOn Wednesday night, AMS Council is set to vote on a motion to reviseits Records Policy (SR2)that, if passed, would mean members of the AMS (a.k.a. students) cannot request access to internal correspondence, transition reports or raw data (data collected by or for the AMS).\nTheproposed changescome afterThe Ubysseyrequested access to redacted emails from the AMS related to the hiring of AMS President Eshana Bhangu asinterim VP financeand discussions around the amendments to theVideo Surveillance Policy (SR14)that now allows filming inside Safewalk and other AMS vehicles in September.\nIn response to the request, Bhangu and AMS Archivist Sheldon Goldfarb said email correspondences are not considered records underAMS codeandbylaws.\n“According to the AMS Bylaws, AMS members can access records and books. Correspondence, in the way the Bylaws currently are written, does not fall under that category,” Bhangu wrote in an emailed statement toThe Ubyssey.\nAt the time of our request, emails seemed to be considered an AMS record — bylaw 18(1) states, “All reports, correspondence and any records … shall remain with the Society to be kept at the offices of the Society” — but it was surprising to learn that they cannot be requested by students.\nWe also requested access to the Electoral Administrator transition report — which was rejected on similar grounds and would not be requestable under the amended Policy SR2.\nWe understand that some documents need to remain confidential;The Ubysseyisn’t asking for records that would leave the personal information of AMS staff and members up for grabs. All we’re asking for is to be able to access redacted documents that society members should be entitled to view.\nThese new restrictions on what documents students can access could be codified on Wednesday.\nMaking internal correspondence and raw data unrequestable by students is bad for many reasons.\nSuch a practice is bad for transparency — a topic that candidates in AMS elections, including the current execs, have beenpromising to address for years.\nThe Ubysseyhas its own reasons for wanting to be able to request AMS emails: to help with our reporting and to hold student leaders accountable. But, students in general should also be able to request emails from their democratically-elected and student-funded leaders.\nWhy can’t a student see email conversations between the VP finance and Studentcare related to coverage under the AMS/GSS Health & Dental Plan? Why can’t a student see emails between the VP academic and university affairs and a student advocacy group?\nRefusing to allow students to see these records also makes it harder for the AMS to call on other bodies, like UBC or theStudent LegalFund Society, to be more transparent with students. Why should people listen to calls for frankness in governance when those demanding these changes are themselves not practicing transparency?\nThe proposed changes leave the door open for case-by-case exceptions for requesting these documents. But, the AMS is still able to leave students in the dark about what’s going on a vast majority of the time — and gives the student society an easy excuse for not sharing anything that could damage its reputation.\nThere is a precedent for requesting emails from the AMS. In 2020,The Ubysseyreported onconflict of interest allegationsagainst then-AMS VP External Kalith Nanayakkara.\nWhen asked about this precedent, Bhangu said this “past lack of compliance with the Bylaw section has been by one individual, and it is not a norm.”\nWhy can’t it be the norm?\nPart of the issue is that the AMS is a private entity. Other public institutions like UBC and the provincial government are required to release emails and correspondences when requested under theFreedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act(FIPPA).\nAnother issue is that theBC Societies Act— the law outlining how private organizations like the AMS function — doesn’t require these groups to even comply with records requests. In this regard, the AMS is being generous.\nDespite this generosity, the AMS can do more — and the first step would be for councillors to vote against the revisions to Policy SR2 on Wednesday.\nThe AMS might not fall under FIPPA, and the Societies Act might not require compliance with record requests, but that does not mean it should explicitly prevent sharing emails and data upon request.\nSimilarly, Bhangu wrote in her statement, “We are happy to consider making exceptions in exceptional circumstances, but we must ensure compliance with our Bylaws to the best of our ability.” Yet, nothing in AMS code or bylaws explicitly prevents the sharing of emails.\nWe urge the AMS to follow its word and commit to transparent governance by voting against these proposed changes to Policy SR2.\nEditorials represent the opinions of the editorial board ofThe Ubyssey.\nShare this articlecopied!\nUbyssey Editorial Boardauthor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
