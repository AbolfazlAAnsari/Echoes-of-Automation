It can feel like UBC isn’t for you.\nThat ain’t the case.\nUnderneath the bureaucracy and between the ‘Admin cares <3’ emails, there’s something worth enjoying. There are communities you never thought could exist and might never pop up again outside of the few years you’re here — it’s just a matter of getting to them.\nCOVID-19 has bodied just about everyone. Every group on campus needs new blood and some reinvigoration, and that’s your job for next year. Don’t let folks forget what it’s like to be present.\nIf you’re one of my fellow grads, the road ahead is, in a word, fuckingterrifying. Revel in surviving these last 56 weeks, take a breath, grit your teeth and give it all you got — that piece of parchment Ono signs means exactly what you make of it.\nIf you’re aUbyssey-er wondering where things go from here, remember that you’ve got 102 years backing you and plenty ahead. When you feel like you’ve doomed the paper or aren’t living up to some lionized legacy, remember that every one of the alumni you’ve heard about failedhardin their time at the paper. I was a timid, slow-moving coordinating editor, but even that wariness didn't stop me from making my share of mistakes that you’ll have to deal with.\nThat’s just the way of the road. We’re student journalists, and we’ll embody both of those words to the fullest.\nOh, and please —please— cut the jargon you’ve got in that article you’re writing. Journalism for journalists is a surefire way to keep yourself locked in an ivory newsroom.\nThis next year’s in flux and it’s all right to be scared. Just mind what you’re doing in response — it’s too easy to stick your head in the sand and ignore the tough stuff, like anailing planetorsystemic racism.With that degree you’re getting, though, it’ll be that much easier to fight those big battles, so keep your focus.\nAsk any staff and they’ll verify that I’ve crammed as many sayings into my meetings and articles as possible, so it’s only fitting to end my time atThe Ubysseywith a cliché that's kept me trucking all these years: nothing worth doing comes easy.\n— Pawan\nShare this articlecopied!\nPawan Minhasauthor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
