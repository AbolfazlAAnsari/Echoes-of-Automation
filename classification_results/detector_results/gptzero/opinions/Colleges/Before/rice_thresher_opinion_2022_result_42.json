The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors.\nOn Feb. 2, 2022, the Thresher published anopinionadvocating for Seth Huston to undergo allyship training in response to his comments on trans-women’s participation in women’s sports. While I whole-heartedly endorse several of the authors’ key claims — such as their opposition toHouse Bill 25— their interpretation of evidence regarding the effects of hormone therapy on trans-athletes lacks appropriate context, serving as a reminder to critically evaluate evidence in politically fraught discourse.\nFor example, the article cites asystematic reviewpublished in the British Journal of Sports Medicine to claim that “measures of strength and muscle area [in trans-women] also fall to less than that of cis men” following hormone therapy. However, this claim omits critical context, neglecting to mention that the review also concludes that “values for [muscular] strength, LBM [lean body mass] and muscle area in transwomen remain above those of cisgender women, even after 36 months of hormone therapy.”\nThe article then goes on to cite ametastudyof eight research articles which finds “no direct or consistent research suggesting transgender female individuals (or male individuals) have an athletic advantage.” However, this metastudy includes just one quantitative cross-sectionalstudythat evaluates the effects of hormone therapy on physiological characteristics. This singular study — which compares the muscle-mass of post-treatment trans-women to pre-treatment trans-men — found a statistically significant difference in muscle mass between the two groups.\nGiven these issues with the authors’ interpretation of the literature, one might be tempted to conclude that trans-women must be barred from competing alongside cis-women in athletics. However, there are several arguments in favor of trans-inclusionary policies that must be considered before reaching such a conclusion.\nFirst, the systematic review notes several limitations of existing research including but not limited to the dearth of prospective studies, small sample sizes, high rates of attrition and study populations composed of untrained individuals as opposed to trained athletes. An additional limitation raised by the cross-sectional study is the lack of height-matched control groups. Given thatheightis associated with lean body mass and variation in height is viewed as an acceptable natural difference in most sports, studies comparing trans- and cis- athletes ought to stratify comparisons of lean body mass by height.\nIndependent of these limitations, however, is the broader philosophical issue of the level of natural variation that is acceptable within a given category of sport. To examine the issue, consider the following two cases:\nCase 1:The internationally-acclaimed volleyball playerFlo Hymanwas born withMarfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome leads individuals to have a large height and arm-span which are advantageous characteristics in a sport such as volleyball.\nCase 2:An athlete with fully-functioning limbs is barred from competing againstA3athletes in the Paralympics due to the unfair advantages yielded by a full set of limbs.\nConsidering these cases in tandem, one might reasonably ask what moral standard permits Hyman’s natural advantages in volleyball while demanding separate divisions for athletes with and without a set of fully-functioning limbs. In my view, the standard to be upheld is thatoverwhelmingadvantages - rather thanmererelative advantages - constitute grounds to segregate sports. Therefore, to deny trans-women entry into women’s sports, one must demonstrate that trans-women’s athletic advantages are overwhelming such that cis-women would be effectively disenfranchised from the sporting event in question.\nThe cross-sectional study highlights the difficulty of making such a determination. Although differences in muscle mass between pre-treatment trans-men and post-treatment trans-women are statistically significant, the range of muscle mass values for both groups is just shy of achieving complete overlap as shown in Figure 1. Furthermore, determinations of overwhelming advantages may vary by sport because different sports rely on hemoglobin levels, muscular strength, and lean body mass to different degrees.\nLastly, an incidental benefit of trans-inclusion in women’s sports is the greater ability to conduct prospective studies assessing the comparative advantage of trans-athletes relative to cis-athletes. Assuming that trans-athletes are more likely to compete under more inclusive policies, researchers would be better-positioned to conduct studies with larger sample sizes and well-defined controls, leading to a more precise estimation of the relative athletic advantages that trans-women may possess over cis-women.\nThus, while I take issue with the authors’ interpretation of the literature on the relationship between hormone therapy and athletic ability of trans-women, I believe a much more robust body of research is necessary to determine whether trans-athletes possess overwhelming natural advantages over cis-athletes.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
