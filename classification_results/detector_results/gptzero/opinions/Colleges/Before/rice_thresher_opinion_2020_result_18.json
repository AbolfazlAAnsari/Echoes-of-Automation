The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors.\nThis is not a conversation. This is not a constructive dialogue. This is not even a matter of opinion. This is a question about whether or not Rice University really believes that Black Lives Matter.\nOver the summer, students have been calling for William Marsh Rice’s statue to be removed from the Academic Quad as well as from our advertising and media. The calls from the student body were clear, concise and consistent: “Down with Willy.” The Rice administration brazenly stated that they “join with … expressions of concern and sympathy and outrage” concerning the murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and countless others, saying they “must work to build an inclusive environment.” But when Black students at Rice brought uptangible action itemsfor this goal, one being the removal of a statue from the Academic Quad, the administration merely emailed that this sentiment was “thoughtful and strongly felt” and evaded undertaking the necessary action demanded. Where’s the “work” that you were so adamant about earlier? Your empty words and empty actions are insufficient.\nOn Aug. 31, I pledged to sit in at the statue every day until it comes down. And with this, the group of students and alumni that joined endeavored to do what we all, as a community, should’ve done a long time ago: Get Willy taken down and stop glorifying a man unworthy of the glory.\nThe longer the statue is on the university premises, the longer the university glorifies white supremacy. Anyone who defends the statue condones anti-Blackness. Anyone who feels that his wealth justifies his statue advocates anti-Blackness. Anyone who falsely equates removing the statue with moving his grave to argue against its removal perpetuates anti-Blackness. And anyone who patrols and protects the statue from so-called damage is anti-Black. The psychological damage that the statue’s continual presence has on Black students is the damage that needs to be accounted for.\nDoes Rice really think it’s Black community — a community that labors, learns and enriches Rice — matters? Does Rice really make efforts to combat anti-Black racism on campus? Does Rice work towards truly embodying a Culture of Care for Black students? If the answer to these questions is yes, then why is there a statue of the man that inscribed this university to besolely for whitesat the center of campus? Of a man thatenslavedand deplored Black humanity?\nThere's no amount of “intellectual discourse” necessary for doing a simple action such as removing a statue.Florida State Universitycan do it.Duke Universitycan do it.The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hillcan do it.The University of Nevada, Las Vegascan do it.The University of Mississippican do it.The City of Houstoncan do it. And my hometown inPitt County, North Carolinacan do it. Why won’t Rice University? Why won’t Rice University change its reality of slacking behind when it comes to racial issues concerning Black people in America? Why won’t Rice University align its stated values with its actions concerning Black people in America?\nThrough our protest, we aim to amplifythe sentiment expressed by the Kinder Institute:“Removal may be symbolic, but it can jump-start a conversation and help us move forward on structural change. The fact is if we can’t remove a monument, how are we going to tackle bigger changes?”\nWe sit by the statue an hour every day because we need to see that statue removed. We all have the ability to do this peacefully and calmly and move towards a future where Rice values Black lives. At this moment, two options exist. In the first, the statue comes down, we stop sitting in and we’ll stop highlighting to any passing by the grievous nature of continuing to have a statue of a white supremacist. In the second, it doesn’t, we proceed to demonstrate, and Black people — Black members of our community — will continue to walk by and see Rice’s continued allegiance to white supremacy on full display. What message does Rice send to the Black community here by glorifying a man who never wanted them here in the first place? By glorifying a man who enslaved and deplored Black humanity?\nThe longer the administration holds off on deciding whether or not to remove the statue, the longer they refuse to confront our university’s history of perpetuating anti-Black racism and bringing harm to Black people in America. The sit-ins will only stop when the statue is definitively removed. Not when a committee forms. Not when a conversation or webinar happens. And not when an empty email offering us no substantive change exists.\nWe sit as long as it sits.\nWe want it gone and there is one entity with the power on campus to move it and that’s you, the Board of Trustees. Therefore, we only have one question:\nWhen are you going to take the statue down?\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
