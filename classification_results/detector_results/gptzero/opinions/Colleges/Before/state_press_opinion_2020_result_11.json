            "inputText": "‚ÄúWhile most young people who get Covid-19 will survive, this doesn‚Äôt mean every college-aged person at ASU will have the same fate.‚Äù Illustration published on Sunday, Sept. 6, 2020.\nAs students began their fall semester at ASU,videos of parties surfaced on social mediaand ASU PD releasedseveral \"student-related\" party citations. Not long after these videos circulated,cases of COVID-19began rising at ASU. Not only are these gatherings dangerous and irresponsible,they are also ableist.\nWhile ASU students may not be throwing these celebrations to intentionally infect as many people as possible, they also aren't critically thinking about how their actions impact others.\nASU professor Terri Hlava, who teachesdisability justice & advocacywithin theSchool of Social Transformation, believes partying during the COVID-19 pandemic can be ableist. Hlava said that ‚Äúableist actions can be conscious and unconscious.‚Äù\nShe believes that students who party are thinking about what they want to do in the present moment, rather than thinking about the future.\nWhile mostyoung people who get COVID-19 will survive, this doesn‚Äôt mean every college-aged person or those who live in the surrounding community will respond the same way.\nAccordingto the CDC, at-risk people ‚Äî typically the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions ‚Äî are more likely than those not at-risk to becomeseverely ill upon contracting the virus.\nOne argument I've seen is that because students are typically young and healthy, those at higher risk should simply stay locked down so that those who are less-at-risk can go out and live their lives.\n#auspol#Covid_19australia#COVID19Aus#COVID„Éº19Why is everybody in lock down, even if not sick?If MOST people who HAVE it are asymptomatic or with very mild illness, it's clearly not a serious threat to the general public!! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èIsolate those at HIGH RISK only.\nThis is ableist. The idea that a group of people shouldn‚Äôt leave their homes to do essential activities ‚Äî because they have a disability or medical condition ‚Äî is wrong and unrealistic.\nAccording to UC Davis,nearly 30% of people with disabilities live below the poverty line, compared to 15% of the general population and 12% of the non-disabled population.\nThese peoplecould be your cashier orbus driver‚Äî who cannot stay at home to work remotely.\nIf someone goes to a large gathering and then grabs takeout or rides the bus to class, they would be putting essential workers in the areaat risk.\nThe people you interact with do not just include your family and friends. They also include theessential workers who provide you with food and transportation, among other services.\nthe towns & cities where you attend college are not your own, personal playground. there is a greater community that you're apart of. stop putting the lives of local teachers, farmers, restaurant owners, parents, caretakers & healthcare workers at risk so u can go to ur fav frat\nTransmission doesn't just impact people with physical disabilities. Many students with conditions like ADHD, dyslexia, autism, anxiety, or depressionrely on the structure and organization they get from an in-person class.\nThose who attend parties and then go to in-person classes risk infecting not only at-risk individuals who also attend class but also those with mental health conditions who have already been struggling to get through the pandemic.\nAdditionally, if classes end up switching completely online because of high infection rates, these same students likely won't be able to receive an education in the format that works best for them, meaning they may end up suffering academically and mentally.\nFor students who continue to participate in large gatherings, Hlava said to think about the reason you‚Äôre at ASU in the first place, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre at school to learn,‚Äù she said.\nHlava also suggested paying attention to the facts behind COVID-19, and how it can impact not just you, but your community.\n‚ÄúOne of the things you might want to pay serious attention to is the science behind the spread.Even if you‚Äôre asymptomaticyou can spread (the virus),\" she said. \"Think about your goals farther down the road, not just on a Saturday night. Think about why you‚Äôre at school. Think about what would happen if you got someone sick.‚Äù\nHlava advised getting an education indisability studiesto combat ignorance and ableism. ASU‚Äôs School of Social Transformation has a plethora of classes on social justice, including some on disability studies and disability justice.\nIf you are a student with a disability who has been impacted by COVID-19, consider reaching out to theStudent Accessibility and Inclusive Learning Services, formerly known as the Disability Resource Center. They can provide accommodations including extra time on exams, flexible deadlines, notetakers, and more.\nIf you are currently struggling with mental health or isolation, reach out toASU Counselingfor one-on-one appointments and support groups.\nThe next time you're about to go party or break social distancing, think about those around you.\nThink about those with physical or mental disabilities who have struggled to stay physically and mentally healthy during this pandemic.
