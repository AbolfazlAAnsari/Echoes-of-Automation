            "inputText": "\"We can’t show support for causes simply to save face online.\" Illustration published Thursday, July 16, 2020.\nWhen racism and inequality dominate national conversation, communities that are affected express their pain and exhaustion. Yet some social media users prioritize their own image online instead of providing effective help.\nPerformative activistsexpress surface-level support on social media. But marginalized people need allies who will make a tangible difference, so it’s time we re-evaluate ineffective approaches to advocacy.\nAs awareness of racial disparities increases and there is widespread conversation about allyship, non-marginalized people feel pressured to perform on social media, resulting in the self-orientedperformative activism.\nRonae Matriano, a Ph.D. student studying Asian American identity, race and racism, said in an email that with “cancel culture” in full effect and people actively calling out covert and overt racism, \"performative activism is another way that so-called anti-racist folks try to cover their asses.\"\n“Performative activists love to talk about how heartbroken they are about the injustices of the world,” Matriano said. “Yet do nothing to actually make change.”\nSome social media users and celebrities, for instance, simply postMartin Luther King Jr. quotesabout equality, participate in a Black Lives Matterrepost chainor make empty promises to “do better.\" Othersstage photo opsat protests.\nCrafting an image of support for good optics, frankly, does nothing to support Black people.\nThis leads into another problem with performance activism: It diverts attention and energy away from issues at hand.Blackout Tuesdayon June 2 is a prime example of this.\nMusic industry leaders Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang originally created the grassroots campaignThe Show Must be Pausedto highlight the industry’s exploitation and racial inequality, but people turned it into abandwagon.\nCelebrities participated in the campaign by posting black boxes captioned “#BlackoutTuesday.” Instagram users then posted black boxes themselves, which ended up saturating feeds andsuppressingresources and protest information.\nThese posts were no longer related to the campaign’soriginal purpose— it was watered down into a counterproductive, performative trend. While participants who wanted to demonstrate their solidarity were likely well-intentioned, there are better ways to support the Black community than by posting a singular black box.\nwhite people after posting their black square on IG with no further info or action for their performative activism piecepic.twitter.com/sqoT9VPvKj\nAdvocacy isn’t a bandwagon. Trends on social media are constantly fleeting, but injustice is not.\nPeople who don't experience marginalization can pick and choose when to show support. They can give up when activism isn’t considered “trendy” anymore. But when Black people, Indigenous people and other people of color experience ongoing adversity, it can’t be ignored.\nWe should skip theslacktivismin favor of genuine advocacy. Matriano said if an individual wants to become an activist or ally and materially improve others' lives, the answer is within the word itself: “to be active.”\nOne simple action they suggested — especially for non-Black people with financial privilege — is to prioritize donating to individuals, rather than large nonprofits and organizations, to redistribute wealth and makereparations.\nWhite individuals in particular should also refuse to besilentbecause their privilege can be used to protect others.\nRefusing to be complicit also extends to educating social circles, Matriano said, because white people seeking to be good allies \"don't let their white friends and family say racist, homophobic, sexist, ableist things.\"\nIt's important, too, to use self-education as an option, rather than place the unpaid educational burden on BIPOC individuals. This can be done by reading and engaging in discussion.\nFor example,Desert Diwata— an Asian community organization Matriano works with — has a Black-theory group for Asians specifically to learn. The group reads and discusses texts by Black theorists and activists. They also have Black Asian facilitators who are financially compensated for educating members of the organization. These steps are taken instead of relying on unpaid emotional labor from Black people, and Matriano encouraged white colleagues to also create their own groups.\n“Read Black theory and Black history to unlearn propaganda that has been so deeply ingrained in American society,” Matriano said.\nThroughout this process of taking action, Matriano said it’s important to acknowledge solidarity isn't a simple statement of support and that change is gradual.\n\"Activists need perseverance, humility andradical self-carein order to make positive and lasting change in their communities,” they said.\nThere are countless ways of addressing racism and injustice to make a difference in marginalized individuals' lives. Why then, should we hide behind half-hearted social media posts or treat activism as a trend for ourselves?\n“Being an activist isn’t about centering yourself in the movement but centering those that you’re fighting for,” Matriano said.\nDesert Diwata's Black theory readings are available upon request.
