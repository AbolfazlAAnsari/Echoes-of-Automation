We need overwhelming change that will ensure no more innocentblack livesare lost at the hands of the police.\nRaising awarenessand educating ourselves on police brutality and racism is necessary, but we also need tangible policy changes to overhaul policing in our country. These problems are widespread, but one way to enact change is through local solutions.\nPolice reform solutions aren’t always “one-size-fits-all.”Congressional proposalswon’t fix every police department's problems in the United States.\nThe federal government may focus on important issues affecting the entire nation, but local officials address specific concerns in our communities. Each community has different needs, making a localized approach necessary for effective reform.\nFor example, powerful,corrupt police unionsare a problem in certain cities. Some places need toremove problematic leadershipin their police departments. Others need acivilian review boardto act as a check on police power. Some communities desire minor reforms while others see their police departments as so illegitimate thatabolishmentis prioritized.\nSome local problems in Phoenix, for example, includepolice misconductand thepurging of misconduct records. Disputes overfunding allocationsare also an issue.\nTo pinpoint and solve specific policing problems across the country,local problem-solvingis necessary. There are manyapproachesthat can create better outcomes for citizens. Communities should take whatever approach is best for them, but that starts with political participation.\nTo install local-level reform, the public must pressure local officials. In order to have our voices heard, one step we must take is voting.\nJames Strickland, a professor at theSchool of Politics and Global Studies at ASU, explained that local governments have various important duties, including allocating resources and determining various policies.\n“Given that local governments affect us in such direct, personal ways, it's important to vote (where possible) to ensure that public policies reflect the preferences of local voters,” Strickland said.\nDespite the importance of voting, however, voter preferences are not always accurately represented.\nArizonastruggles with voter turnout. This problem worsens in local elections. Themost recent dataon eligible voter participation in mayoral elections found that Phoenix had a 15% turnout rate in 2015. The median voter age in this election was 61.\nOfficials like mayors and city council members help enact the reforms we seek, so we must care about these elections. Younger generations are especiallypassionateabout criminal justice reform, so if we want our demands reflected in political decisions, voting is necessary.\nLocal participation is also important because select groups often have disproportionate influence.\n“Some have argued that local governments too often hear from small groups of people who are more directly affected by particular policies,\" Strickland said. \"Examples of such groups include small business owners, landlords, or citizens groups.\"\nThe professor explained that this leads to inequity.\n“The argument goes on to state that the policies of local governments tend to reflect the preferences of these small groups more so than the general public,\" he said. \"This might lead to bad outcomes if one thinks that particular groups seek unfair advantages or protections.”\nFor example, we see this inequity in Phoenix with contract negotiations.Police unions, which oftenprotect officerswith a history of misconduct,negotiate contractswith city officials to outline the terms of employment for the police. This leaves the public out of the matter and minimizes checks on police power.\nTo help maximize the people's political clout, we must increase local political participation. Mayors, city council members, state legislators, andmoreall have elections this year.\nWhilevoter suppressionexists, this isn't an excuse to not vote and allow certain groups to exert disproportionate political power. Make sure toknow your voting rights. Encourage state legislators to promote voting and tell senators topass legislationthat protects our rights.\nVoting in local elections can't be underestimated. It's necessary to ensure officials represent the community's needs. We must engage with candidates, demonstrate, participate in advocacy groups, and vocalize frustration too.\nEngaging in local politics is one vital course of action to end police brutality and transform policing in our communities.\nVoter registration information can be foundhere.\nReach the columnist atlhrabik@asu.eduor follow@lynettehrabikon twitter\nEditor’s note: The opinions presented in this column are the  author’s and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its  editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
