While the latter focuses on the financial matters of the university, the Senate is focused on academic governance.\nAt UBC, the Senate is divided into the UBC Vancouver and Okanagan Senates, which come together occasionally (by occasionally, more like every 5–10 years) through the Council of Senates.\nWithin the UBC Vancouver Senate, there are 13 standing committees which focus on a variety of topics such as appeals on academic standing and academic discipline, curriculum, academic building needs and academic policy. Each student senator sits on one to three of these committees, including some representation as committee chairs and vice-chairs.\nThe Senate meets monthly on the third Wednesday of the month at 6:00 p.m. These meetings are hybrid, and you can watch the livestream of these on the UBC Senate Facebook page or follow along on @UbysseyNews’s Twitter account.\nSenate Committee meetings vary depending on the committee. Most committees will meet monthly, although some may meet more or less frequently depending on the work being done. These meetings are typically closed to the public.\nSenate membership is divided up into various groups including ex officio members, deans and elected faculty and student senators. Of the students, there are eighteen of us — five elected at-large and the remainder elected by their respective faculties with two for graduate and postdoctoral studies, as well.\nThe Student Senate Caucus (SSC) is the elected student senator forum for discussion and consultation regarding all things Senate. We come together, usually monthly prior to Senate meetings, to share updates on what is happening in our respective committees, discuss the agenda and materials, get updates from AMS and GSS representatives and ultimately coordinate our advocacy to ensure that we can effectively advocate for students in all of our meetings.\nThe SSC has two co-chairs, Romina Hajizadeh and Laia Shpeller, who coordinate and facilitate these meetings, sort out student senator committee placements, as well as take on additional responsibilities throughout the year when needed.\nThis year’s SSC has a member chairing the Academic Building Needs Committee, and members vice-chairing the Academic Building Needs, Agenda, Awards and Curriculum Committees.\nYour student senators for the 2022-2023 school year are:\nApplied Science\nArts\nCommerce and Business Administration\nDentistry\nEducation\nForestry\nGraduate and Postdoctoral Studies\nLand and Food Systems\nAllard School of Law\nMedicine\nPharmaceutical Sciences\nScience\nMembers at-Large:\nA lot of what the Senate works on pertains heavily to students and we mean a LOT.\nSome examples of major motions relevant to students that have recently gone through Senate include the rescinding of former residential school principal BishopJohn O’Grady’s honorary degree, the banning of the use ofProctoriofor proctoring online exams and the creation offall reading break!\nBut besides that, the work we do directly relates to your entire academic experience here at UBC.\nAcademic calendar changes? That's Senate.\nGrading and curriculum policies? Senate.\nConferring your degree? Senate.\nAs student senators, we’re elected to represent you and ensure that student needs are being met as much as possible.\nShpeller is a fifth-year biomedical engineering student and the Faculty of Applied Sciencestudent senator and Student Senate Caucus co-chair. Hajidazeh is a third-year international relations student,senator at-large and Student Senate Caucusco-chair.\nIf you have any questions for your student senators, you can reach out to the SSC by emailing Shpeller atlaia.shpeller@ubc.caor Hajizadeh atromihajizadeh@gmail.com.\nSenate Recentredis a column written by the Student Senate Caucus.\nShare this articlecopied!\nRomina Hajizadehauthor\nLaia Shpellerauthor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
