Perhaps the Hitler reference he and Stanford professor Iván Marinovic used as an example of an extreme result of distorted values was a bit much, but it isn't his main argument related to academic freedom and achievement.\nI have personally witnessed the added stress and anxiety students experience when they are thrust into academic settings for which they are not prepared. MIT’s curricula and competition already provide more than enough stress as it is. Let’s help better prepare disadvantaged, minority, LGBTQ, etc. students at lower levels so when they are admitted they can compete on an equal footing. If professors aren’t even-handed, they should be educated or replaced so there is a level playing field for all students.\nI am worried about our society in its readiness to label people or actions as racist, an extreme form of bias.
