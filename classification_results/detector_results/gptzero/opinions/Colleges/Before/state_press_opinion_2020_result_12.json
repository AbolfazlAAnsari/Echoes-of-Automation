            "inputText": "On Sept. 1, the Undergraduate Student Government Tempevoted13-4 with one abstention to “defund, disarm and demilitarize” the ASU Police Department.\nWhile this USGTresolutionwill have no tangible impact on ASU PD, it remains a slap in the face to the men and women who courageously serve our ASU community, while it simultaneously undermines our community’s safety.\nThe resolution — which wholly disregards police officers’ safety — asks the police department to “suspend the carry of firearms … includ(ing) the reserve carry of any firearms that are not regularly carried by ASU PD, such as any rifles possessed by ASU PD.”\nAn ASU Police spokesperson said in an email that “having our officers unarmed would compromise the safety of our students, faculty and staff. ASU police officers are properly trained in the use of force, to include firearms, which are essential when responding to potential acts of violence on campus, such as an active shooter type situation.”\nUnfortunately, there have been far too many shootings on college campuses:Virginia Tech,Umpqua Community College,Oikos Community College,Santa Monica Collegeand many more. How can police respond to active shooters if they are unarmed?\nWhile slogans like “defund the police” and “abolish the police” are increasingly echoed by young Americans, the notion that communities are safer with fewer police is simply untrue and dangerous, especially for those living in high-crime neighborhoods.\nAfter theNew York Police Department’s anti-crime unit was disbandedas part of a $1 billion budget cut, there were177% more shootingsin July 2020, compared to July 2019.\nSome attribute the rise in shootings to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic fallout. However, there werefewer\"crimes of desperation\" such asgrand larceny, or theft of property valued at more than $1,000, during the same time period.\nA recent poll by Gallup found that81% of Black Americanswould prefer police spend the same or more time in their communities, despite the growing notion that defunding the police is beneficial to communities of color.\nJoseph Murray, a sophomore studying political science, said in a message \"if the police are defunded, the police would be in a reactive role rather than a proactive role\" and \"would only have the resources to react to crimes in progress after they have happened.\"\nWe are all horrified by instances of police brutality, but it’s unfair to cast a wide net on theover 600,000police officers in this country due to the actions of a few. A recent Pew studyfound 86% of police officerssay \"police work is harder today as a result of these high-profile incidents.\"\nIt is never right to define a large group by the actions of a few.\n“We understand and respect those who are seeking to implement social justice initiatives in light of the tragic events this year involving some police officers in various parts of the country,” the ASU PD spokesperson said. “But reducing the capacity of a police department that is here solely to serve and protect the campus community will only make the campus less safe.”\nLaw enforcement isn't optional, but while left-wing activists are calling for fewer police, police areproposing reforms and greater accountability.\nPolice officers have a job that most are unwilling to do. Most of us wouldn’t deliberately put ourselves in danger to protect a stranger. Even fewer of us would be willing to do this job while protecting a community that is seemingly ungrateful.\nASU Police — along with Tempe PD and the nation’s 600,000 law enforcement officers who uphold the honor of their badge — deserve our utmost respect.\n\"Without them, we would have a lawless society\" Murray said.\nReforms, such as those proposed in theJUSTICE Act, are needed, but it is imperative that all of us “back the blue\" and show our appreciation. Thank an ASU Police officer the next time you see one and show them that this USGT resolution is not representative of the ASU community.\nReach the reporter atarondla@asu.eduand follow@arjunrondlaon Twitter.\nEditor’s note: The opinions presented in this column are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
