She explained that while in the past “Hoover has been very disjointed from the rest of Stanford,” now many of its fellows hold joint appointments with academic departments at Stanford, going on to say that “over the past decade, Hoover has become much more integrated into Stanford.” She ended witha pointed remark: “In a very real sense, and I think this is important to keep in mind, they are, in fact, us.”\nI am not sure what exactly Provost Drell meant by this, but this statement has very serious implications for honest and hard-working Stanford faculty.

Attaching a course number to one’s name does not make that person a scholar and a member of an academic community. Provost Drell’s answer gives an impression that the University’s leadership is using the dignity and accomplishments of Stanford faculty to conceal and protect the Hoover Institution fellows who are seriously damaging the reputation of our university.
