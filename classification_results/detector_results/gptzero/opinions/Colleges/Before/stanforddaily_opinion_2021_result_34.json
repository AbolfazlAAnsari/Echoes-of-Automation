            "inputText": "As a Stanford student, I’ve appreciated the University’s unambiguous commitment to universal, basic COVID-19 precautions. Throughout this pandemic, Stanford has relied on evidence-based advice from faculty experts toprevent large outbreaks on campusand keep us safe from COVID. In a recent email regarding Stanford’s preparations for the fall quarter, Provost Persis Drell summarized the University’s position,asserting, “We know that the combination of vaccination, mask wearing and testing provides powerful protection against COVID.” Meanwhile, however, people I care about deeply have been denied these protections and forced back into unsafe schools and workplaces. As a student, it has been discouraging to witness multiple Stanford affiliates repeatedly leveraging the University’s name through national media appearances, policy advising and expert-witness testimony to attack the same measures being implemented on our campus.\nThe only time that Stanford publicly stated that an affiliate’s statements were “inconsistent with the university’s approach” was in a Nov. 2020 response to Hoover Fellow and former White House COVID-19 AdvisorScott Atlas’stweetcalling for the people of Michigan to “rise up” against public health interventions. The Universityclarified, “We support using masks, social distancing, and conducting surveillance and diagnostic testing.” Unfortunately, “inconsistencies” between Stanford’s policies and some affiliates’ advice to the broader public have persisted, which warrants further examination.\nStanford was one of the first universities in the country to require vaccines forstudents,faculty, and staff. For this practice, Professor Jay Bhattacharya singled out Stanford in an op-ed and characterized policies like ours as “ill-advised” and “unethical.” He also advised against vaccination for anyone who has had COVID, claiming (despiteevidenceto the contrary) that “it simply adds a risk, however small, without any benefit.” Bhattacharya provided affidavits echoing these claims insupportof lawsuits againstMichigan State University’sandGeorge Mason University’s vaccine requirements, which mirror Stanford’s policies. At the same time, Bhattacharyarecently citedStanford’s vaccine requirement as a reason he feels comfortable returning to in-person instruction this fall.\nMoreover, Bhattacharya and other Stanford affiliates have repeatedly spread false and misleading claims about vaccine safety and efficacy. From hislarge platform on Twitter, Professor Michael Levitt has posited that vaccine-attributable deathsmay besignificantly underdetected, vaccinesare amoney-making scheme by big pharma and thatthe vaccine’s main mechanism is the placebo effect(despitebeing vaccinated himselfand occasionallypraising the vaccine’s apparent effectiveness).\nThe evening after the FDA granted full approval to the Pfizer vaccine,Bhattacharya appeared on Fox Newsto assert that the approval was too fast and that we lack sufficient data on safety and efficacy of the vaccine. These statements are debunked byStanford Healthcareand theStanford Center for Health Education’s Digital Medic Initiative, which affirm the COVID vaccines are safe, effective and well-researched. Indeed, Stanford Medicine helped lead Phase-3 trials for theJohnson and Johnson vaccineandpediatric trials of the Pfizer vaccine. Disturbingly, the latter trial was attacked on Fox News by Atlas, who baselessly accused researchers of violating medical ethics and characterized a clinical trial participant as“brainwashed” and “psychologically damaged.”\nStanford affiliates have also publicly attacked surveillance testing programs, even as Stanford itselfcontinues to conduct testingthrough an entrance testing program for arriving students and a weekly testing requirement for all students, faculty and staff. A recent university-wide communication from administrators announced additional testing requirements for non-students,explaining,“Our university leadership and medical professionals have concluded that community-wide surveillance testing will provide a meaningful layer of protection.” The next day, Bhattacharya penned an article in a British tabloid criticizing such programs as“useless” and “actively harmful.”Previously, Levitt amplified claims thatpresymptomaticandasymptomatictransmission are negligible, relying on misinterpretations of others’ work and directlycontradictingstatementsby the scientists involved.\nThese claims have extended into policy advice. In October of 2020, while Stanfordofferedfree, voluntary testing for faculty, staff and postdocs, and required weekly surveillance testing for students, Atlas used his position within the federal government tourgegovernments throughout Florida to roll back their asymptomatic testing programs.During a roundtable with Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, Levitt advisedagainst testing and contact tracing. During the same roundtable with DeSantis, Bhattacharyaadvisedagainst requiring tests before medical procedures. This Florida policy wascited as a driver of unsafe working conditionsthat led to 35 nurses from a single hospital quitting. By contrast, a COVID-19 test isrequiredbefore most medical procedures at Stanford hospital.\nStanford’s stance on masks also diverges sharply from public statements and policy guidances issued by these Stanford affiliates. Stanford leadership has repeatedly affirmed that masks are effective. In a recent campus conversation, School of Medicine Dean Lloyd Minorstatedthat the “probability of transmission is dramatically lowered in a masked environment.” Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne also hasclarifiedStanford’s stance: “we believe, based on science-informed public health guidance, that they do inhibit the spread of the virus.” A newrandomized trialled by Stanford researchersfound“strong evidence that mask wearing can interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.”\nMeanwhile, a series of tweets by Atlas — opening with,“Masks work? NO!”— were removed from Twitter for misinformation. Levitt mused on Twitterabout whether masks can induce hypoxiaand shared a study — which has beenretracted— that claimed masks increase carbon dioxide inhalation. Incidentally, upon that study’s publication, Bhattacharya appeared on Fox News to discuss this study as evidence of dangers to children, likening masks to “child abuse.” These comments were never revisited after the paper’s retraction weeks later, and these claims contradict statements by theAmerican Academy of Pediatricsand theCenters for Disease Control.\nAs of Aug. 2,Stanford is under an indoor mask mandateissued by the county that applies to everyone over the age of two. Santa Clara County Public Healthreinstatedthis indoor mask mandate as the “least disruptive and most immediately impactful additional measure”to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In a town hall with Governor DeSantis that wasremoved from Youtubefor spreading medical misinformation about the efficacy of masks, Bhattacharya claimed, “masks not only have not been effective, but have been harmful.” He reiterated this claim in a follow-up piece for the Wall Street Journal,claimingthe “benefits of masking children are small to none; the costs are much higher.” He affirmed this stance once again in a July town hall with DeSantis, stating it is, “on net, not a good idea to mask children.” He further claimed that the Delta variant“does not change the calculus”on whether to require masks, even while Stanford’s communication on reinstating face coverings invoked the need to“minimize the spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant”in light of an uptick in hospitalizations connected to this variant. Later that week, DeSantis passed anexecutive orderblocking schools from mandating masks. Bhattacharya served as an expert witness for the defense in the ensuing lawsuit by parents fighting this executive order, testifying that“the marginal benefit of masks … is very close to zero.”\nResearch on improving and critically evaluating current public health measures is vital, and Stanford faculty members have undertaken vital work todevelopsafe and affordable protocols for manufacturing and reusing masks, toexaminepotential alternative strategies for vaccine allocation and tostudythe performance of rapid, at-home COVID-19 testing kits. The Stanford affiliates mentioned above, however, have frequentlybypassedthe realm of scientific exploration and peer review to bring fringe positions directly to national media and policymakers. A judge in Florida recentlynotedthat the evidence brought in the mask mandate ban case by the defense, which featured Bhattacharya as its sole scientific expert witness, “reflects a minority, perhaps even a small minority of medical and scientific opinion.” As official University communications havestated, the combination of testing, masks and vaccinations are allowing us at Stanford to move safely forward with in-person activities and lift alternative social distancing measures like business closures and remote education (measures that the same affiliateshavestronglycriticizedandopposed).\nUniversity affiliates can, and often even should, disagree with their institution’s policies. Indeed, members of our community have repeatedly organized for changes to Stanford’s policies, advocating forrevisions to the campus compacttoprotect survivors of sexual violenceandprevent students from being evicted,protesting an inequitable vaccine priorization algorithm,raising concerns about move-in policies,advocating for greater protections for campus workers,critiquing the hasty nature of this winter’s cancellation of in-person activities for undergraduatesandstriking for enhanced COVID protections for resident assistants. It is important to note that these other efforts have been characterized bydirect,publicdialogue with Stanford University leadership in efforts to make their policies better. But, with the exception of asingle articlementioning Stanford’s vaccine mandate in a list including other universities, Bhattacharya, Atlas and Levitt have not engaged with Stanford’s masking, testing or vaccination measures.\nInstead, they have used cable news, podcast appearances and social media to tell people outside the University that such public health measures are ill-advised. And they have gone to government officials elsewhere, most notably in Florida, to push them to strike down policies that align with Stanford’s. Especially from within the confines of a wealthy, elite university, there is a disconnect between staying silent about public health measures — and protecting yourself — while simultaneously critiquing those same measures — from which others stand to benefit. Indeed, DeSantis himself noted this discrepancy last fall during a roundtable and extended an offer to Bhattacharya and Levitt that wasdeclined: “if you guys really want to have in-person, we’d definitely be able to find spots for you in Florida.”\nMasking, vaccination and testing requirements are not controversial at Stanford. As a recent email from University leadership noted, the University community has overwhelmingly followed basic health protocols. 95% of people using the self-reporting tool required for on-campus activity have been vaccinated, and“individuals on campus have been taking requirements for face coverings seriously.”  As a Stanford student, I’m immensely privileged to have access to tremendous resources and a supportive community who have helped keep me safe throughout this pandemic. I recognize the enormous sacrifices our local healthcare workers have made over the past year and a half, andI hear their calls for continued caution.\nI’m grateful to be surrounded by people who understand the importance of universal safety precautions to protect one another. In turn, for the past year and a half, I have carefully followed public health recommendations and University guidelines to protect those around me, including the people mentioned here — even as they work to undo these protections for others.\n\n"
