Grace Mengintroduceda bill on Feb. 2 to make the festival a holiday, in order to “recognize the cultural and historical significance of Lunar New Year.” Through this, she emphasizes that the broader American communities also understand the belief that giving Lunar New Year recognition in the federal sense would not only validate the cultural conflicts faced by the country’s growing Asian-American population, but would also ensure that students around the country learn about the necessity of respecting diversity.\nSimple recognition may truly end up being the key to harmony. When traditions can be understood on a wider scale, societies can become more accepting of diversity.\nSince some school districts in New York, Virginia and Iowa alreadyclosefor Lunar New Year, establishing Lunar New Year as a federal holiday would give the festival more validity. Several Asian-American communities tend to feeldisplacedin the country even if they have lived here for generations. This cultural confusion can be attributed to the lack of mainstream awareness and acceptance of different cultures. Taking the first steps toward recognizing the cultural diversity that the United States hosts would be the first step toward creating a community that is not plagued by cultural divide.\nMaking Lunar New Year a federal holiday would allow for the festival to be celebrated in its entirety, and would also help other communities pitch in for increased awareness of different cultural traditions. For the Washington Post, UCI’s Professor of Asian American Studies Judy Wustatedthat, “Lunar New Year celebrations, while rooted in tradition and culture, have also been important for Asian Americans for economic and political reasons.”\nThis sentiment is clearly echoed by lawmakers. Ensuring that Asian American communities have the opportunity to celebrate a festival that is integral to their roots would help create a sense of compassion within communities that would ensure that Asian Americans aren’t forced to be conflicted between their Asian and American identities, as perceived by those around them.\nThe acceptance of this proposal would guarantee that future generations, regardless of racial descent, will respect and value the different perspectives surrounding celebrations  that exist. Since several people mark the occasion with an ode to their ancestors, this bill would also do the same. Asian communities wereridiculedfor simply existing and following their traditions and cultures in the 19th and 20th centuries (with a rise in those similar emotions today).\nWe need to  honor the traditions that have borne hurt over a long period of time, especially with therecentrise of incessant intolerance, by giving cultures the respect and recognition they deserve.\nNandini Sharma is an Opinion Staff Writer.
