At least four Greek organizations at ASU have been put on interim suspension for possible COVID-19 violations.\nSeveral of ASU’s Greek organizations have been hot topics in the news lately, sometimes for thewrong reasons.Between hazing and breakingCOVID-19 guidelines, the Greek Leadership Village has been a hotbed of controversy.\nSeveral fraternities at ASU have placed thehealth of their membersand the ASU community in danger. At this point, something has to be done. These organizations need to be held accountable for their actions, and regulations need to be implemented so that these behaviors do not reoccur.\nWith Arizona being aglobal coronavirus hotspot, parties thrown by any organization can contribute to the spread and even becomesuper-spreader events. Students who attend these parties do not seem too worried about spreading COVID-19 to vulnerable populations, and at least four Greek organizations have been put on interim suspension for possible COVID-19 violations,according to azfamily.\nThat alone should be a punishable offense, but these gatherings have been the least of the community’s worries. Suspectedfraternity parties, which the University has said is investigating, have taken place around campus sinceFall 2020.\nThese “investigations,” which nothing seems to come of, but this seems to be more than an issue with just one fraternity or sorority. This is an issue with the entire Greek Life system at ASU.\nThe idea that young people are not as severelyaffected by the pandemic is not true. One ASU studenthad a heart attackdue to COVID-19 complications. While mostyouth casesare mild, we cannot ignore the effects that COVID-19 has on those who areelderlyor who havehealth conditions. If people could think about theircommunity,instead of thinking about their own selfish desires, this health crisis could have been over by now.\nThis type of irresponsible behavior is nothing new to some Greek organizations. Even without COVID-19 in the equation, these fraternities still find other ways to pose as a local biohazard.\nOne ASU fraternity, Kappa Sigma, is in legal trouble due to somehazing incidentsthat went too far, which is not the firsthazing-related lawsuita fraternity at ASU has faced. According to a complaint filed in the Maricopa County superior court, Kappa Sigma pledges were forced to perform rituals in multiple off-campus houses, one they called “Auschwitz,” which isanti-Semitic,to say the least.\nOne of the pledges was forced to put hot sauce in his pants, sleep outside on a bed of rocks for only a few hours a night and put on a diet of skittles and tequila, the complaint said. This caused one of the students to have a health episode, where he developeddiabetes, according to the lawsuit.\nThese incidents are mild when you look further into some of Greek Life’s pastcontroversies. Greek Life also has a bad reputation when it comes tosexual misconduct, according to articles compiled by Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault.\nJoseph Forte, an ASU alumnus, director the film \"Alpha Class,\" and co-founder ofD-MAK Productions,said since social media is so prevalent, some of the controversial actions taken by members of Greek Life are easier to spot now.\nForte's film highlights what ASU's Greek Life was like a decade ago and offers suggestions for reparations.\nHe stated that the issues within Greek Life are internal and need to be resolved from the inside. He suggested that a hazing ban is not the solution because students may not comply, which could potentially lead to the performance of even worse hazing rituals. Rather, Forte suggested that regulations should be implemented and enforced for the types of hazing that are permitted by the University.\n\"Everything that you make illegal, people gravitate to,\" Forte added.\nWhat can we do as a University to make sure these types of incidentsare properly handled and not repeated?\nFirst, ASU leaders need to take a strong stance against this type of behavior. They should not be afraid to call out the names of organizations who participate in hazing, breaking COVID-19 guidelines and other dangerous behaviors. It would be prudent for them to make a statement on these incidents when they happen.\nForte proposed alternative initiation and hazing rituals — such as cleaning, exercise or study hours — that could help students learn valuable life skills as opposed to dangerous activities. Additionally, he said he believes that bringing in former Greek Life alumni every year could help in boosting morale and managing Greek issues.\nThough Greek Life is flooded with issues, Forte said it still has helped some people make lifelong connections. \"In such a big campus like ASU, Greek Life helps shrink things down into smaller communities\" he said.\nIn an ideal world, these friendships could still be made, while also filtering out some of the more negative effects Greek Life has had on the lives of many others.\nNo matter what type of solution Greek Life comes up with, they need to think of one sooner rather than later. Otherwise, it's only a matter of time before another student's safety is put in jeopardy.\nReach the columnist athtenore@asu.eduor follow@haleyyhmton Twitter.\nEditor’s note: The opinions presented in this column are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
