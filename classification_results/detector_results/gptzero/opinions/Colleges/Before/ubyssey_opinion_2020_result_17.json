The idea is that this friend will be able to bring their self-soothing to work, and hopefully, it will help them during a stressful day.\nWhat’s great about a mason jar is that you can leave it on your desk, beside your computer or on an office shelf.\nFor this project, we included many items, and I hope that by sharing this experience, you might feel inspired to create one yourself!\nAn extra charger:We bought a charger because it’s easy to forget your charger at home when you’re rushing on your way to work because you accidentally slept in.\nLip balm:We knew that my friend liked lip balm, so we tried to find a cool flavour. We ended up with a tropical flavour, and thankfully, our mutual friend liked it!\nMints:I love having mints (or chewing gum, Tic Tacs, Icebreakers) in my bag, because not only does it taste good, but it makes my day a little easier when I’m sitting in class trying to resist biting my nails due to anxiety.\nChocolate:I can’t tell you how much I love chocolate, so we bought our friend a little Santa-shaped chocolate filled with peanut butter. So delicious!\nMandalas and coloured pencils:We printed off mandalas, rolled them and inserted them in the mason jar. We bought some coloured pencils at Muji (they fit in the jar, thankfully) and now my friend can take a colouring break anytime they feel like they need to!\nLavender sanitizer:Washing your hands or using hand sanitizer is important to keep germs away! Lavender smells way better than alcohol and feels softer than hospital hand sanitizer.\nAll self-soothing kits contain different items, depending on the needs of the person. You can include items like:\nFinally, don’t feel obligated to fit all those items in a mason jar! My personal self-soothing kit items are kept in a box beside my night table. If you’re running out of ideas of gifts for your friends, consider creating a self-soothing kit for them. And create one for yourself in the process!\nThe authors of this column are not mental health professionals.
