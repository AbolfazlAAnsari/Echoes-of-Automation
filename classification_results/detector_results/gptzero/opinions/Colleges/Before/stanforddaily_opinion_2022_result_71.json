            "inputText": "Alex Young, a masters student in chemical engineering, is a Founding Member of Abolish Stanford Greek and a former ISC sorority member.Abolish Stanford Greek is a coalition of students, alumni and faculty dedicated to ending the presence of historically white IFC/ISC Greek organizations on Stanford’s campus. The group has more than 700petitionsigners and 2,000 followers overTwitterandInstagram.\nThe University’s recentdecisionto house five Interfraternity Council (IFC) and six Intersorority Council (ISC) organizations next year demonstrates the administration’s utter disregard for student welfare. The plan silences the voices of countless students harmed by Greek life, ignores the clear majority of students whowantGreek life unhoused, and shows a lack of good faith in dealing with student advocates.\nIn summer 2020, the student group Abolish Stanford Greek (ASG) released itsfounding op-edurging Stanford to withdraw recognition of historically white IFC/ISC organizations. ASG’s founders had tried to reform their Greek chapters, soften the racism andclassismof recruitment, transform the misogyny andheteronormativityof social events, and erase the transphobia of gendered housing. They found, however, that national organizationsforcechapters to reinforce elitist, toxic and inequitable structures on our campus, no matter how sincere Greek student leadership may be in trying to reform.\nIn fall 2020, the group presented an ASSUresolutionto redistribute the ten Row houses reserved for IFC/ISC organizations back to the housing draw. Supporters highlighted the unfairness of a wealthy, white quarter of the student body occupying a third of Row houses. Apologistspointedto the community benefits of Greek life, but could not explain how such benefits were (a) exclusive to Greek life, (b) worth the harm, or (c) deserving of prime real estate on campus. Even the most avid proponents recognized the damage that Greek life has caused at Stanford, fromhazingandeating disorders, tosexual assault,druggings, anddeath.\nAs a result, the president of the IFC and Phi Kappa Psi, Terrell Edwards ‘21,stepped downfrom his position to support the resolution, stating that “Greek life needs the university to help it move forward, and I think unhousing is a great first step towards that … unhousing presents the University with the opportunity to acknowledge underrepresented people on the Row.” As Senator Leah Harris ‘21 put it, “I’m not sure why [Greek orgs] need to be housed to [reform].”\nThe resolution passed with supermajorities in both theUndergraduate SenateandGraduate Student Council, sending it to the Faculty Senate (where faculty could make recommendations). But the matter wastabledin winter 2021, with Vice Provost Susie Brubaker-Cole arguing that greater student input was needed. This was a point that the administrators stressed to ASG meeting after meeting; even with minority harms established, what was the majority student opinion?\nThe question has been answered; ASG joined Greek representatives on a neutral ASSUcommitteeto conduct a student body-wide survey in 2021. With a high and representative turnout, thesurveyfound that 83% of undergraduates wanted to see some change in the Greek system, with 58% of undergraduates supporting unhousing Greek organizations in spring 2021. This percentage matched the 60% support for unhousing found in the Daily’s fall 2020survey.\nThe ASSU exec and ASG both met with administrators in separate meetings in spring 2021 to review the survey results and convey the ASSU recommendations to unhouse. In June 2021, the administrationannouncedmostly single-year assignments for ten Greek houses, in a break from previous four-year assignments. ASG saw this as an incremental victory — an opportunity for the administration to see the oxymoronic impossibility of “equity, inclusion, and diversity” in Greek life that arose to protectwealthy networks, as higher education diversified.\nThroughout the 2021–2022 school year, ASG tried to meet with Vice Provost Brubaker-Cole and other administrators. In January, a promised meeting was understandably delayed as the Office of Student Engagement juggled rapidly changing COVID-19 restrictions. From January through March 2022,ASG received five separate emailsfrom administrative schedulers confirming that a group meeting was being arranged to discuss housing allocations. In the meantime, ASG sent updates, including atransitional proposalfor a smaller number of Greek houses and dorms, to reduce Greek life’s disproportionate dominance over the Row.\nBut on March 10, without meeting with ASG, the administration acted. The Office of Student Engagement informed Greek chapters that they plan toincreasethe number of housed IFC/ISC organizations from ten to eleven, and add one Multicultural Greek organization. The new addition is Kappa Alpha, the fraternity previouslyunhousedfor taking on non-paying boarders and also the site of thesexual assaultof Chanel Miller. According to a March 9 LEAD 150 class presentation by three KA members, the chapter today is 75% white, compared to the 32.4% white study body.\nAdministrators know that the majority of students and victims of Greek life oppose these allocations. That may be why it took the university three weeks after informing chapters of their housing status to quietlypublishtheir retrenchment of segregated Greek housing to the broader campus community.\nWhy do dues-only, selective-membership Greek organizations deserve campus houses over the 650+ open-membership clubs? No one has been able to explain why administrators believed to be acting in the interest of students did not listen to students — neither the majority who called for unhousing, nor ASG’s 700petitionsigners, nor the 150+ people who providedtestimonials. Nor can anyone explain how administrators can continue to ignore statistics about the dangers of Greek houses, the fact that many fraternities have expressedwillingnessto unhouse or reconcile such action with ResX’srecognitionthat the Row reflects “concerning demographic trends” (read: is overwhelmingly white).\nASG has found only one explanation for all this: donor influence.\nSince ASG’s founding, Greek organizations have organized letter-writing campaigns for their alumni to implore the Stanford administration to ignore ASG. Manylettershave included threats of donation-withholding if the school takes steps to unhouse Greek life. This is significant because it is well-known that Greek alumnidonate moreto their universities than non-Greek alumni. Given that wealthy, connected students tend to join Greek life, it is also unsurprising that Greeks tend to be thewealthiestand the most powerful alumni.\nWe suspect these letters drove the administration to house eleven IFC/ISC organizations next year. It also seems likely that concerns about alumni donations have motivated the university to continue recognizing Greek organizations and award them with administrative support and special institutional privileges likeoff-campus banking, that no other clubs are allowed.\nNext year’s housing allocations are a reminder that the Stanford administration embodies the status quo. Donor interestsdriveouradministrators, even when those interests run counter to student safety, housing equity, minority protections, and majority opinion.\nThis decision is an insult to the entire Stanford community, but it does not mean the end of ASG. The administration cannot run out the clock on this movement and wait for us to graduate. ASG will continue to advocate for the best interests of all students, regardless of Greek affiliation. We will continue to provide support for victims of Greek life, counsel Greek members hoping to reform, leave, or decharter their organizations, and serve as a source of information for all.
