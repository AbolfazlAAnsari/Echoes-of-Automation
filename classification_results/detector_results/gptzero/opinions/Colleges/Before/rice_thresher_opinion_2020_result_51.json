The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All letters to the editor are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors.\nOn April 21, the Thresherreportedon a Student Associationresolutionurging Rice to suspend standardized testing requirements for applicants who will matriculate in 2021. The resolution passed the SA Senate with near-unanimous support on April 29, the same day that the National Association for College Admission Counseling released astatementurging its members to “reassess their admission criteria,” especially standardized testing. Both the resolution and the NACAC statement cite existing educational inequities, which include unequal access to theinternetandcollege-preparatory curriculum. These inequities have only been magnified by COVID-19-related hardships, and fall disproportionately on the marginalized students on whom Rice depends to fulfill itsmissionof “cultivating a diverse community.”\nAt the time the Thresher article was written, more than two dozen schools, including Amherst College, Pomona College, Tufts University and all University of California campuses, had already suspended testing requirements for 2020-21 applicants in light of COVID-19. The day after the article was published, Cornell Universitydid the same. Several schools, including theUniversity of Oregon, will remain test-optional permanently.40%of four-year colleges and universities in the United States are already test-optional or test-flexible, with some having implemented test-optional policiesas early as 2004. Rice is lagging behind these peer institutions’ implementation of equitable admissions processes.\nVice President for Enrollment Yvonne Romero da Silva makes statements in the Thresher article that do not reflect the reality of standardized testing or the obstacles marginalized students have been facing even before COVID-19. She draws ondisproventalking points in support of standardized testing, such as the idea that standardized tests can serve as an equalizing force for students who come from underserved backgrounds. Many of these claims had been countered by the sources provided in the SA resolution.\nShe concedes COVID-19 “might be an impact [on] future Rice students’ ability to submit admission requirements,” but to qualify her statement with “might” ignores theeffectsof COVID-19 which can already be seen. Students face eviction, domestic abuse and lack of access to disability services, mental health treatment and academic support. The uncertain extent of long-term consequences is all the more reason for immediate relief. In suspending their testing requirements for 2020-21 applicants, the Cornell Office of Admissions stated, “We can’t pre-define in absolute, comprehensive terms what economic or personal disruptions will look like. We don’t plan to require any students to justify their reasons for not submitting test results.”\nIn the article, SA President Anna Margaret Clyburn is quoted saying, “especially for international students, students in rural areas or students in areas highly affected by COVID-19, it's far more likely that they will be unable to take their ACT or SAT, which renders a portion of our applicants unable to successfully apply to Rice.” Romero da Silva responds, “the College Board offers fee waivers for qualifying students, and that there is a plethora of free online resources available for students to use to prepare,” placing the onus of responsibility on students, including some who have been denied the chance to even take the tests at all due tocancellations. Moreover,fee waiversandfree online resources, such as Khan Academy, have failed to close racial or economic gaps in either test results or educational outcomes.\nAnoverwhelmingbodyofliteraturecontinues to revealpersistent,undeniableinequitieswhich havealways existedin standardized testing. In the Washington Post, Valerie Strausswrites, “Researchhasconsistentlyshownthat ACT and SAT scores are stronglylinkedto family income, the education level of the test-taker’s mother, and race,” trends which are corroborated by theCollege BoardandACT’s own data. In fact, gaps in scores across demographicswidenedin 2019 despiteassurancesfrom the College Board and ACT that they are working to close them. Finally, standardized tests have proven to beinvalid,unreliable, and apoor predictorof success in college.\nRomero da Silva claims testing requirements allow Rice to recruit from programs such as QuestBridge. Romero da Silva is quoted saying, “‘[Standardized testing] has been a tool we have been able to use to identify students with great promise and talent, where in their environments they may not have all of the competitions and research opportunities.’” However, schools like the University of Chicago, which has been fully test-optionalsince 2018, continue to beQuestBridge college partners, and there is no reason to believe a test-optional policy will preclude Rice from doing the same.\nTest-optional schools are more inclusive. In 2018, NACAC released a multi-yearstudyof 955,774 applicants from 28 four-year colleges and universities with test-optional policies. They reported that “a [test-optional policy] works well at a variety of institutions… Almost all institutions in our study increased enrollment of underserved populations, with many showing proportionate increases exceeding those found at test-requiring peer institutions.”\nIf anything, Rice will reapsignificant benefitsby suspending testing requirements. Test-optional schools attract more diverse applicants, lower acceptance rates and accept more underrepresented minorities, factors which heavily affect the U.S. News & World Report college rankings. A three-yearstudyof colleges released in 2014 found only “trivial” differences in GPA and graduation rates between students who submitted standardized test results and those who didn’t.\nA test-optional policy is a tangiblesteptowards more equitable admissions. For now, the SA resolution seeks temporary relief: a suspension of standardized testing requirements for 2020-21 applicants, who will continue to face unimaginable threats to their lives, their loved ones, and their futures. Rice has the responsibility and opportunity to make a statement that above all, it will protect and uphold the most vulnerable members of its community. On Thursday, we will join student leaders and other stakeholders to discuss testing requirements with the Office of Admissions. We urge the Rice community to contact Romero da Silva and other members of the Rice administration to discuss this issue. Help us hold administrators accountable to the values which will encourage 2020-21 applicants to choose Rice.\nAnna Margaret Clyburn is a Martel College junior and the current SA President. Grace Wickerson is a Brown College senior and former SA President. Daniel Koh is a Jones College senior and former Jones College SA Senator.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
