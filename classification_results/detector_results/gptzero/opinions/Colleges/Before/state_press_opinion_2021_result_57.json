            "inputText": "One of ASU’s “Wearing is caring” signs is pictured while students walk toward the Taylor Place dorms on Thursday, Aug. 20, 2020, on the ASU Downtown Campus.\nASU has become one of thelargest campusesin North America, with approximately125,000 studentsin the University community at the start of the 2020-2021 academic year. Amid the pre-COVID era, ASU's campus life was strongly community-based and centralized on residential experiences. However, due to the pandemic, that type of residential living poses one of the largest threats to the safety of students and faculty.\nRather than meet the challenge of regulating the behaviors of irresponsible students, ASU has enabled these risky behaviors. The University has chosen to ignore the seriousness of the pandemic by being complicit in every irresponsible social gathering that has occurred near campus, especially in relation to parties.\nASU needs to perform some seismic reforms on how it polices COVID, includingthe expulsion of entire fraternities and sororities if they're caught partying.\nArizona has the most covid cases and some frat at ASU threw a huge party this weekend. this is just one reason why I never liked going to them\nSimilar to many universities across the country, ASU is faced with the difficulty of creating systems and monitoring services for the implementation ofCOVID proceduresto minimize and control any outbreaks that occur on campus.\n“At the beginning of the pandemic there was little oversight on work being done on implementing any kind of procedures on coronavirus related responsibilities,\" said Janae Stevenson, a senior studying political science and a formercommunity assistantat Manzanita Hall on ASU's Tempe campus.\nStevenson elaborated about the embarrassingpenal systemput in place to make sure that students who violate COVID safety guidelines are given consequences for their actions.\n“At most, I heard of students having to write an essay about their actions,” she said. “Whenever I approached one of my supervisors asking about the consequences some students would face, they responded with telling me, ‘Okay, let’s take an educational approach.’”\nStevenson said sheleft her job as a community assistant last semester because, among other things, the protocols for managing COVID were nonexistent.\nAlthough she has left her position, she has heard stories from her former colleagues about the lack of guidance the University has given for managing students with COVID and taking action against those who knowingly break campus guidelines.\nASU needs to take this situation more seriously by implementing regulations in a draconian way to systematically enforce consequences for students who violate procedure, thereby mitigating the spread of COVID on campus.\nI find it frustrating that ASU strictly reinforces regulations for things such asalcoholor campuswalk only zonepolicies — but somehow the continuing spread of an infectious, deadly disease is an exception?\nThere should be random room checks to make sure residents are following protocols, digitalcontact tracing, mandatory vaccination requirements once it becomes widely available and a zero tolerance policy for all non-compliant social gatherings. Every resource should be dedicated to making the violation of COVID rules as serious as this University takes the walk only zones and keeping alcohol off campus.\nReach the columnist atebarraz7@asu.eduand follow@ErikRaza1on Twitter.\nEditor’s note: The opinions presented in this column are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
