Yet, as a result of its untimely removal from Texas school libraries, students of all races lack the ability to access the knowledge the book holds.\nMoreover, reading novels that contain LGBTQ+ characters or people of color allows students within those demographics to see themselves in these stories and, perhaps, feel less alone. Representation is a powerful tool that helps people of all ages resonate with those around them. As a child or young adult, one craves the kind ofrepresentation and relatability that can aid themas they navigate what it means to grow up, especially when it comes to being a part of a minority group. Therefore, students need to have access to such novels that do not shy away from these themes.\nThe wonderful thing about books is that they allow one to become educated on important matters that impact society and the very readers immersed in the storytelling. By banning novels that contain stories filled with social issues and minority groups, we are inevitably dooming students to a youth filled with confusion, misguidance and loneliness.\nLourdes Enriquez is an Opinion Contributing Writer.
