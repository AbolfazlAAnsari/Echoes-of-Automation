The high rates of sickness are most commonly attributed to the increased frequency of contact among students — think communal bathrooms, large lectures, and use of shared spaces like common rooms and libraries — in contrast to the decreased contact students experience while living at home.\r\nWith this experience being so widespread among freshmen, one might expect Harvard to have some sort of guide for students who are sick besides the suggestion in the student handbook to seek guidance from HUHS. Though HUHS provided me with practical medical advice, they were unable to advise me on how to navigate the stressful logistics of an unfamiliar college lifestyle while sick, beyond a suggestion to speak with my proctor or resident dean to deal with the “academic impact.” While resident deans, proctors, and Peer Advising Fellows contribute to a larger network of support in order to close this gap, it can be hard to understand how to utilize this system when you are new on campus.\r\nThe issue first-year students face when dealing with sickness is not a lack of adequate resources, but rather a limited understanding of what exactly is available and how to access those things.\r\nHarvard must bridge this wide information gap among its younger students. First-year Orientation is the perfect platform for such a conversation to take place and doing so would likely decrease the stress around contracting an illness on campus. Helping students navigate illness on campus is more than providing a brief overview of HUHS in an orientation module or requiring students to get flu and Covid-19 vaccines before the semester ends. It’s increasing awareness about the process for ordering bagged meals from Annenberg, offering specific examples of what your proctor can assist you with while sick, and clearly defining how to report a sickness-related absence (if HUHS has not yet confirmed your diagnosis or been able to see you for an appointment, for instance).\r\nDealing with sickness in college presents a learning curve. While some might argue that this experience presents an opportunity to develop one’s sense of independence and personal accountability, taking the time to make Harvard’s resources widely known makes it easier for students to learn to tackle such a situation on their own. Given the prevalence of the “freshman flu,” a more comprehensive orientation event and guide to handling sickness as a Harvard first-year seem a worthwhile project.\r\nMcKenna McKrell ’26, a Crimson Editorial comper, lives in Pennypacker Hall."
