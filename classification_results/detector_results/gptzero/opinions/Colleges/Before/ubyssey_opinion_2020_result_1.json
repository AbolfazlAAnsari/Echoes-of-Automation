As students, it can be hard at times to sympathize with faculty. This is especially true when we experience instructors who directly contribute to our feelings of powerlessness and marginalization within the institution.\nHowever, in the time of COVID, it is critical to realize that these cyclical harms will continue until we understand that the under-resourcing and over-extension of faculty is fundamentally a student issue.\nFaculty burnout isn’t just anecdotal — we have real evidence of increased workloads and stress levels. At the Board of Governors meeting, we learned through thetenure track faculty COVID-19 surveythat faculty are experiencing substantial increases in teaching and service workloads, as well as caregiving responsibilities. 73 per cent of faculty respondents also reported that stress, anxiety and sadness have reduced their ability to work through the pandemic.\nWe also learned recently that insurance claims for anti-depressants for faculty and staff haveincreased by 15 per centwithin this pandemic. These rates could easily be attributed to simply existing in a pandemic and fielding endless requests for academic concessions from students in distress, but it’s most certainly exacerbated by individual teaching loads currently at145–150 per cent of standardfor tenure-track and non-tenure-track faculty.\nRecent examples of university ‘support’ for faculty — like thehurried announcement and submission deadline for a long-overdue $400 desk/chair reimbursementorthe insinuation that the employee & family assistance program is a main source of support— demonstrate that it has been trying to reach a comically low bar.\nWhat these findings don’t tell us is the ways that these conditions and stressors have manifested in the classroom for students. Student social media platforms, like the UBC subreddit, are full of screenshots of harsh emails, complaints about unreachable professors and untimely assessment feedback.\nWith the information we have about the conditions faculty are working within, this should hardly be shocking. We need to move beyond interpreting faculty short fuses and shortcomings as a personal offence and understand it as what it truly is: an unavoidable human response to structural squeezing and exploitation of labour. When faculty members are being spread unreasonably thin by the university, this exhaustion subtly manifests in the classroom and unintentionally impacts students' learning experiences.\nThis isn’t to say that unreasonable and uncompassionate behaviour from faculty is ultimately excused — far from it. There will always be lines that are crossed and using a systems approach does not absolve individuals of the harm that they have caused. However, if we want to be able to stop reproducing the same harm, it’s time to move beyond pointing fingers at individual faculty members and instead consider sharpening our focus on poor working conditions and executive decisions that have exacerbated them.\nEspecially in our isolated COVID contexts, student and faculty advocacy cannot exist in separated silos. It’s time to gather in our shared experiences of powerlessness and unite to create an academic community built on the pursuit of knowledge, and most importantly, the necessary resources and support to do so.\nJulia Burnham is a graduate student in the Department of Educational Studies, student senator and former AMS VP Academic and University Affairs.
