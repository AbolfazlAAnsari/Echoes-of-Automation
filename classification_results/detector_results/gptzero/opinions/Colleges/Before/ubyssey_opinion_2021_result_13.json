How exactly are second years who are only now beginning to get to campus supposed to find friends? What would you suggest?\nThat’s an amazing question, reader. The thing is, I don’t really know.\nI was really lucky to be able to move to campus in the middle of my first year (in the midst of the pandemic), but I know that not everybody had the same opportunity. Making friends can be intimidating and difficult, but it doesn’t always have to be.\nOne surefire way to make friends is to go to class! I know, I know, it’s class. But it’s class!\nYou’ll have people who are interested in the same things you are, and they might be in your faculty or major which is always nice. Making friends in an academic setting is always a safe and surefire way to create a community on campus.\nIntroduce yourself to your classmates, especially those in your tutorials. You’ll spend tons of time with them in class, so they might as well know how to say your name.\nEven if these friendships never surpass the level of class acquaintances, at least you’ll still have someone to cry about your final paper with and to give you notes when you skip class to go to Whistler (which youdefinitely, totally under no circumstancesshould do).\nBeing involved in clubs, student societies and our very ownstudent newspaperhas allowed me to make friends at school.\nAgain, here you’ll meet tons of people with similar interests but you’ll also meet people outside of a strictly academic setting. I feel that in a club, or inThe Ubyssey’scase, a cult (I’M JOKING. Not really, though) setting, I can be more myself which means that I can make way too many jokes that make no sense and that I can talk about howPitch Perfectis the best film of all time.\nBut for real, going to clubs and trying new things through these clubs has allowed me to create so many connections with super cool people! Though I’m not besties with all of them, they’re still my friends.\nI think that the goal of making friends isn't to find a few besties but to open up your social circle and to create connections with people you wouldn't have otherwise.\nLiving in student residence is also another great way to make friends. A lot of my friends from my first year I met in residence either by chance, through group chats or through a friend of a friend.\nIf you live in first-year residence, go and eat at your dining hall. I know, it’s stressful and honestly kind of shitty to go alone, but that’s how I met some of my friends! People will sit beside you. Why? Because everyone is in the same boat! Damn, take a shot every time I say that in anAsk Iman(hint: the count is at four).\nIf you’re in upper-year residence, occasionally go to a floor event or make an effort to get to know and spend time with your roommates. Even if you don’t make friends at your floor events, you’ll probably get to get some free stuff and get to hang out with your RA, which is nice when they’re cool! And let’s say you don’t become besties with your roommates, but since you’re friendly, you’ll have fewer issues with them throughout the year (and beyond)!\nMaking friends can be a pain in the ass but it doesn't always have to be. By putting yourself out there, as scary as it can be, you can broaden your horizons to different communities and people from varying backgrounds.\nBy throwing yourself into school, work, clubs and residence life, you will be able to meet so many people! And if you want to meet a whole bunch of journalism nerds and join a cult that’s not a cult but is a cult, volunteer forThe Ubyssey!\nYou’re doing great. Keep it up!\nNeed advice?
