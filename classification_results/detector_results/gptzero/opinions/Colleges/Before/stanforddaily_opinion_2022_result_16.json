            "inputText": "I am by no means a staunch ally of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. He isbankrolled by PG&E, the state’s largest utility company that he lets get off scot-free despite itsclear responsibility for wildfires under his watch. He has also abandoned his 2018 campaignpledge to enact a single-payer healthcare programin the state. This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to my critiques for the leader of the Golden State.\nWe should not ignore Newsom’s broken promises, but it is necessary to take note when he clearly demonstrates political ingenuity.\nFor the midterm elections this year, he went on the offensive forProposition 1. If a majority of California voters support it, there will be constitutional protections in the state for contraceptives and abortion. Newsom made the right decision to go on a$2.5 million ad campaign on the ballot measure’s behalf. This is the right course of action even when considering the fact that abortion faces little risk in California; Newsom has already signeda series of bills into law expanding abortion protectionsin California. Taking a stand against the Supreme Court’s disgustingrepeal ofRoe v. Wadelast June, Newsom’s approach will serve Democratic politics well. Amid concerns that Democratic prospects will take a turn for the worse and hand Congress as well as state governments across the country over to Republicans, Newsom will not leave it up to chance. On the fight for Prop 1 to keep abortion in the political conversation, Newsom said to Politico, “The better we do on this, the more intensity, the more we dial it up, I also think it sends a message that reverberates across our borders.”\nThe connection between victories for Democrats across the nation and the fight for abortion access could not be more obvious. Even in Kansas where voters last voted blue on the presidential level in1964,59 percent of voterswanted to keep abortion protections in place.\nThe power that abortion has to tip the scales in favor of Democrats panned out once more ina tightly won House election in New York, where Democrat Pat Ryan outperformed Biden’s margins in the area two years ago. Hours afterRoe v. Wadewas overturned, hereleased his campaign’s first adand had abortion as the core message. A former Army officer during the Iraq War, Ryan rhetorically asked “How can we be a free country if the government tries to control women’s’ bodies?” and responded “That’s not the country I fought to defend.” Ryan made his support for abortion central to his campaign. This is a good sign, considering howmost predictions and trends throughout historypoint to a Democratic loss of the House during midterm elections with a sitting Democratic President.\nAt the very least, Newsom is pointing in the general direction that Democrats can and should follow. The importance of Newsom’s direction is underscored by the strong role that California has long had on the national stage. The state was at theforefront of several fights against the Trump administrationon issues such as climate change, immigration, education and healthcare. Kamala Harris, prior to becoming vice president andbreaking Senate tieson important pieces of legislation, was the attorney general for California and then served as one of its U.S. senators. Looking even further back in history, beforeChief Justice Earl Warrenbrought the Supreme Court to an era of ensuring civil liberties and racial justice, he served as attorney general and governor in California. The state, for several decades now, has been leaving its mark on the country.\nWhile voters outside California will have no say on its abortion measure, that does not mean they are not feeling the effects of the conversation that California is helping shape. Since the Supreme Court toreRoe v. Wadeto shreds, women have made upa majority of newly registered votersin the states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Importantly, this comes asa recent Gallup poll analysishas shown women to vote for Democratic candidates 14 percentage points more often than Republican candidates, a strong sign for Democratic turnout. Crucially, those three states are poised to have close racesfor their respective Senate races. In a just barely Democratic-controlled Senate, this is of paramount importance.\nIncreasingly competitive senatorial and gubernatorial races in the Midwest get a lot of focus, reasonably so. The Newsom approach of embracing the abortion fight full-stop will serve Democrats well in those races. Maintaining this message gives newly-registered and continuing Democratic voters something clear and urgent to rally around. The nation is looking to California once again, and Newsom on the fight for Prop 1 and reproductive justice in general is in the spotlight. Newsom continues to be on the right side of this fight, and I commend him wholeheartedly for his bold action. He is helping to pull the Democratic Party in the right direction. I hope that this is one of the things that gets Democrats across the finish line to winning congressional seats, state legislatures, governorships and local offices across the country.\nSebastian Strawser ‘26 is an Opinions contributor.
