We are not missing much, though: the debate would have just regurgitated generic and predetermined political party talking points. If we want campus discussions on politics to have an impact beyond elections, we should invite all voices to the table and talk policy on a comprehensive level.\nWith the hot-button topics originally planned for the debate — the Russia-Ukraine War, healthcare and gun control — the possibility of voters’ opinions being swayed by the debate right before Election Day was slim. Ultimately, a more productive conversation would focus on long-term policy outcomes and not just electoral victory, which is especially useless with a student population that votes majority Democratic.\nMore importantly, the debate should bring in other political organizations on campus such as Torch — Rice’s Libertarian student organization — and Rice Left to debate the merits of various policy positions on all dimensions of the political spectrum.\nWhile it’s true that elections typically end up being between Democrats and Republicans, this is a product of our electoral system, which can be debated in and of itself. But within the two parties on the ticket, there is room to push each more towards the extremes or to the center by focusing on specific policies. These discussions should continue year-round to motivate students to talk to their representatives, participate in primaries and get more involved in politics.\nThe shallow “debate” that was planned is an affront to what the university stands for. Rice is dedicated to research, conversation and the pursuit of knowledge, not to recycled talking points. We cannot make advancements in public policy if our sole purpose is scoring sound bites. The debate should not simply be an opportunity for self-affirmation. Instead, the goal of political organizations on this campus should be to mobilize students to dedicate their time to advocating for the best policies for the people of Harris County, Texas and the United States.\nEditor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Ben Baker-Katz, Morgan Gage, Bonnie Zhao, Hajera Naveed, Nayeli Shad, Riya Misra, Michelle Gachelin, Daniel Schrager, Prayag Gordy and Brandon Chen. Editor-in-Chief Ben Baker-Katz recused himself from this editorial due to his reporting on the corresponding story in our news section.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
