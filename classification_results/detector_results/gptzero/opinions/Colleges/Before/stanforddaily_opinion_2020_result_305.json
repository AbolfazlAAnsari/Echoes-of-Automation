Though the ramifications may not be felt acutely and equally across campus, we all hold the responsibility to protect all members of our community in any way possible. It falls on the University now, more than ever, to protect its most vulnerable populations, and we implore students to take up that mantle as well and reflect the outbreak’s gravity in their actions. The choice to dismiss this virus is not one that everyone has the luxury to make.\nThe Vol. 257 Editorial Board consists of Claire Dinshaw ’21, Malavika Kannan ’23, Layo Laniyan ’22, Adrian Liu ’20, Jasmine Liu ’20 and Willoughby Winograd ’22.\nContact the Vol. 257 Editorial Board at opinions ‘at’ stanforddaily.com.\n\n"
