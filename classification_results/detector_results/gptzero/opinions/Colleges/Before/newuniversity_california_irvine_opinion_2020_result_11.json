            "inputText": "We may possibly be nearingthe endof the pandemic, but cases remainhigherthan ever, especially in California. Orange County, along withevery otherSouthern California county, has returned to the most restrictive “purple tier” of California’sBlueprint for a Safer Economy. Am I at all shocked? Not really. Every single time cases have gone down, or restrictions have been relaxed, cases have immediately gone back up. This is proven by the United States’curvewhen it comes to COVID-19.\nGiven that UCI is in a purple tier county, some on-campus activities have been impacted by the “Return to Purple Tier,” as described in anemailsent by Interim Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Hal Stern to the UCI community. In the announcement, not many restrictions have changed aside from indoor reservations for the ARC being prohibited, and study spaces in libraries no longer being offered. In-person gatherings were already prohibited, so the two restrictions are largely non-consequential to students.\nUCI has been largely successful in preventing the spread of COVID-19 on campus, and I, as an on-campus student, can confirm that. There may be some downsides, but despite those, the policies put in place seem to have stopped the spread of COVID-19 on campus in its tracks. These policies are not only keeping the community safe but also the community around the school.\nSome of the required activities, likeweekly testingand the introduction of the “ZotPass” earlier this month, make it easier to identify COVID-19 cases early on. In doing so, UCI provides the necessary care to the infected that will help them to fight the virus while also separating them from others that they may infect.\nOther restrictions given to on-campus residents include no guests in dorm rooms or admittance to the dining hall. However, students may move freely within their community, according to an email to Mesa Court residents by Mesa Court Housing Director Lou Gill. This presumably means we are unable to spend time with friends from other communities like Middle Earth or Arroyo Vista as long as these restrictions remain in effect.\nWith the Thanksgiving holiday coming up, there are concerns that students who leave for the holiday will bring COVID-19 back with them from home. This is a valid fear, as experts havealready warnedthat cases in the U.S. will likely rise during Thanksgiving and peak shortly after. Fears of this were heightened after Thanksgiving celebrations in Canada were followed by the country’s highestspike in casessince the start of the pandemic.\nWith the amount of daily cases in Canada being around4,500and the U.S. reaching above100,000everyday, fears that the U.S. will do much worse in controlling the disease are not at all unfounded.\nSo, what is UCI doing to prevent a post-holiday outbreak on campus? They’re encouraging studentsnot to come backto campus until winter quarter if they decide to leave for Thanksgiving. In general, students who decide to come back will berequiredto undergo a 7-day sequestration and be tested for COVID-19. However, the details for each resident housing is dependent on the housing community. In an email sent for Mesa Court residents, a 14-day sequestration will be enforced. This seems good in practice, but the wording should be of concern.\nThe meaning of “sequestration” leaves me fearful for those who are remaining on campus for the entire break. Residents were required to “sequester” when first arriving on campus, but nothing was really done to enforce that. It was not a quarantine, we were just told to only hang out with our ZotPods. However, students still interacted with people outside their ZotPod, making trips to UTC with other friends and having group gatherings in Aldrich Park regularly.\nShould someone actually bring the virus back to campus after returning from Thanksgiving, there is a large risk for an outbreak if they are allowed to roam freely, which seems likely. The best way to prevent an outbreak after Thanksgiving is to impose a 14-day quarantine, not a 7-day sequestration, for residents.\nKeep them in their rooms!\nThis is the best way for those who cannot travel home to enjoy a COVID-19-free holiday from the comfort of their dorms. Why should those who cannot go home have their holiday possibly plagued with a COVID diagnosis? Allowing returning students to move at their pleasure presents a risk to those around them if they had indeed brought the virus back from home without realizing it. UCI does have good prevention guidelines in place, but sequestration instead of a quarantine puts all those staying on campus for the holiday season at risk.\nWhile the restrictions have kept the campus case count low, with itspikinga bit in the recent days, UCI has essentially kept cases low enough to be contained with ease. Sure, some of the restrictions might not be entirely enforceable and might scare some. I have to admit; I have been cautious around those who hang out in large groups and mix between communities because the potential to start an outbreak if even one of them had the virus is scary. Despite loopholes being abused by students and the medical jargon being tossed around, our campus continues to remain a leader in preventing the spread of the virus while also enjoying a somewhat normal version of on-campus living. These restrictions might not be perfect, but they get the job done.\nMoh Samhouri is an Opinion Intern for the fall 2020 quarter. He can be reached at samhourm@uci.edu.\n"
