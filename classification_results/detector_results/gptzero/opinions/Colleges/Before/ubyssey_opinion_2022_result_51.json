It’s like, who did this?”\nThis is a sentiment I kept hearing on campus these past weeks.\nAnd the answer is, no, the weather is not nice. It’s alevel 5 drought. That is the highest level. 5/5. This is only thesecond timewe have hit level 5 in BC. The first time was last year during the heat dome whichkilled hundreds of peopleanddecimated sea-life. According toThe Canadian Press, Vancouver sees around 165 millimetres of rain between July and mid-October. This year it has rained 16 millimetres.\nLas Vegas got more rain than Vancouverthis summer. Wildfires rage in late October, and as the drought stretches into salmon spawning season, streams are running dry, with one particularlyhorrific videofrom Heiltsuk territory showing a dry stream bed littered with dead salmon.\nNo, the weather is not nice: the smoke thatbillows off Cypress mountainto obscure the mountains, the heat in the fall, the smell of the dry and burning rainforest. Welcome to the anthropocene. The climate crisis.\nAs for who did this? Who ordered the sunny skies? Well,mostly fossil fuel companies did, but we shouldn’t let ourselves off too easily either. According to thesixth IPCCreport, anthropogenic (anthro → human → our fault) climate change causes and worsens droughts. The report also warns that “Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation willmiss a brief and rapidly closingwindow of opportunity to secure aliveableand sustainable future for all.” .\nAnd we are continuing to put in orders for dry summers and rising seas, locking in emissions that will drive up global temperatures.\nThe rain has returned, but it may not bring respite. Drought hardens the ground, making itmore susceptibleto flooding and erosion. A week of heavy rain could wreak havoc on the landscape, sending landslides crashing into the streams and rivers. Rain running over soil as if it was concrete, shearing off anything that cannot hold on. We might not notice from UBC’s sparkling towers, but that does not mean it isn’t happening. If all this unsettles you, good.I want you to panic.\nWe get there is a climate crisis and we know October should be well into the season of the dripping raincoat. And still… “isn’t the weather nice?”  Are we not connecting the dots? Or perhaps bored of this monotonous cataclysm?\nSometimes eco-anxiety gets the better of me and comments about the nice weather start to chip away at the thin veneer of my composure. But then I remember — this is our future.\nWe will live the rest of our lives in this crisis, and while I believe we have the responsibility to bear witness and to take action, we also have to live. To enjoy the sublime beauty of the natural world. It is the little things that will get us through. Wind in the trees. Seaweed in the current. Or my dog’s fascination with the smell of wet grass and concrete today after one millimetre of rain (that smell is calledpetrichorwhich is, incidentally, an awesome word). At least for me, it’s always the little things. If it is to be sunny in October, I suppose we should enjoy the sunset.\nBut don’t forget that October’s sunny skies are because of the climate crisis. The weather may be beautiful, but no, it’s not nice.\nThe weather is coming for us.\nForrest Berman-Hatch is a fifth-year student studying anthropology and political science. He is a columnist forUnwreck the Beach,The Ubyssey's sustainability column.\nThis is an opinion letter. It does not reflect the opinions ofThe Ubysseyas a whole.
