            "inputText": "To the academic community, the Trump administration’s efforts to restrictH-1B work visasandF and J visa stayswere alarming — but not surprising.\r\nBy now, we arewell awareof the Trump administration’ssystematic opposition and denialof scientific investigation.Slashing funding,marginalizing experts, andsuppressing certain researchhave made a mockery of rational decision-making and leadership. A global pandemic has killed over 220,000 Americans, and nearly a third of usbelieve in coronavirus conspiracies.\r\nYet even more damaging are the Trump administration’s attacks not against science itself, but against its foundation: its people.\r\nThe promise of American research rests on the contributions of immigrant and international trainees.Roughly half of Ph.D.-level science workersandpostdoctoral researchers, as well as more than a quarter of science and engineering faculty in the U.S. are immigrants. Fromgroundbreaking discoveries and patents to Nobel Prizesandjob creation, immigrants are essential drivers of American scientific innovation. And for decades, the promise of a thriving, global-focused research community has positioned the U.S. as aworld leaderin science and engineering. “If someone has merits, this is the country where he/she will be recognized,” said Dr. Taslim A. Al-Hilal, who was raised in Bangladesh and now works as an assistant professor at the University of Texas at El Paso’s School of Pharmacy.\r\nBut over the past four years, the situation has changed, and national politics are impossible to ignore. Donald Trump and his administration have clearly communicated that immigrants are no longer welcome, and life in America can no longer just be about the research.\r\nFor new arrivals to the U.S., Trump’s hateful rhetoric invokes fear and a sense of otherness in an already uncertain situation. Trump’spolitical rise beganwhen he falsely claimed Barack Obama was not an American and a Muslim, and therefore unfit to serve as President. While in office, he has denounced immigrants from “shithole countries,” demanded that women of color in Congress “go back” to the “crime infested places from which they came,” and implicitly supported awhite nationalist movement. Trump’s verbal harassment targeted at Muslim, Latinx, and Black immigrants in particular inspirelegitimate concernsforphysical safety.\r\nThis rhetoric has translated intoharmful policy, withover 400 executive actionspassed on immigration. This year, H-1B visaswere frozenand the Muslim-focused “travel ban” wasexpanded. Even with valid documents, foreign-born researchers face increasingsuspicionand instability. This July, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement abruptlybarred international studentstaking online classes from remaining in the U.S. For students already facing a pandemic, this proclamation threatening deportation was deliberately cruel.\r\nStudents forced out of the U.S. would lose laboratory and educational resources, and face disruptions to housing, healthcare, and teaching. Unsurprisingly, the uncertainty caused by this order was a source of major anxiety — just the latest Trump administration action with significant psychological and material consequences for international students. Although later rescinded, the order made clear that the Trump administration will continually probe the boundaries fortargeting immigrants.\r\nAltogether, these words and policies have had their intended effect: Accosted by vicious policies, anxious about racist violence, and cut off from their families, foreign-born researchers feel more unwelcome, unsafe, and unable to plan for the future than ever. “The last 4 years have been absolutely exhausting. Each day you wake up wondering if the next policy decision will impact you,” wrote Dr. Ana M. Porras, a Colombian-born assistant professor in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Florida. “I do feel constant anxiety and it often distracts me from doing my research.” Other scholars question how to envision career plans even one or two years ahead, scared that Trump’s possible re-election might result in their having to return to their home countries.\r\nThe numbers reflect these feelings. Between 2015 and 2018, international student enrollment in U.S. universitiesdropped over 10 percent; international students who enrolled elsewhere listed thesocial and political environmentas one of their top reasons. Concurrently, the U.S.’ relative research output hasshrunk. Trends indicate aprofound loss of international confidencein the U.S. worldwide, eroding its solid research foundation.\r\nPresident Trump’s policies have been painted as a “war on science,” but this title is insufficient: Trump has attacked not only science but also its people — its humanity. By excluding immigrants and international students, and devaluing their lives and safety, his administration harms our community.\r\nWhat can we, as academics, do about this? We canbegin by learning: understanding immigrants’ stories and their positive impacts on American science, as well as the shifting policy landscape. Informed and motivated, we can contact our representatives, aid organizations involved inimmigration justice, and speak out, proudly and vocally, both in support of international researchers and against the administration bent on ending them. We can vote for a candidate whose policiesexplicitly support science and scientists. In particular, professors have a responsibility to defend the individuals whose contributions have built their careers.\r\nIt is time to demonstrate our respect for our immigrant colleagues through voice and action, and preserve science’s humanity.\r\nAlex J. Najibi is a Ph.D. candidate at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences."
