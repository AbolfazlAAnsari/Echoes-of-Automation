            "inputText": "Fellow MIT Graduate Students,\nOn April 4–5, we will vote on whether we wish for the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) to represent us. Voting yes would bind us for years to come to UE, an organization that, in addition to being afiscally irresponsible choice, holdsmany positions that are unrepresentative of MIT graduate students. To list just a few:\nTheydo not supportnuclear power.\nThey denounce collaborations with U.S. allies such asIsraelandJapan.\nTheysupport Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, claiming that “the U.S. government and media continue to vilify his government as a ‘dictatorship.’” Needless to say, there is no media conspiracy. According to apiece inThe New York Times, the “Maduro administration has been responsible for… plunging the country into a deep humanitarian crisis. …  He has also attempted to crush the opposition by jailing or exiling critics, and using lethal force against anti-government protesters.”\nThey wereagainst the expansion of NATO and Obama's supportof the2014 Ukrainian revolution, which overthrew Putin’s puppet government in Ukraine. Even after Russia invaded Ukraine,they have maintained their anti-NATO sentiment.\nThese positions range from ill-advised to downright abhorrent; even more concerning is the way in which their documents (some of which are linked above) distort facts, history, and context in order to advance their propaganda.\nRegardless of how much autonomy we may or may not have as a local chapter,we cannot in good conscience affiliate with or financially supportsuch an organization(we would be paying them approximately $2 million per year, nearly half of their current annual budget). We urge all graduate students to carefully consider not only whether they are willing tofinancially and reputationally strengthen UE, but also whether they are willing toforce their fellow graduate studentsand graduate students for years to come to do the same.\nIf the vote passes, it would be extremely difficult for us to divorce ourselves from UE in the future, as our relationship with MIT would legally be through UE.A vote no is not a vote against unionization in general but merely against our unionizing with UEandwould preserve our ability to unionize in the future, either as an independent union or as part of a different national one.\nUE is morally,financially, and intellectually bankrupt. Whether we join them will be determined by a simple majority of those who vote. Regardless of your opinion,share this letterorotherwise inform your fellow graduate students about UE’s policy positionsso that everyone can cast an informed vote.\nIf you would like to sign our open letter, please do so athttps://tinyurl.com/NotWithUE.\nSigned by (as of press time):\nAlexander Siegenfeld, Physics PhD CandidateAkiva Gordon, Chemical Engineering PhD CandidateBernardo Aceituno, Mechanical Engineering PhD CandidateTal Sneh, EECS PhD CandidateAdina Bechhofer, EECS PhD StudentSabrina Corsetti, EECS PhD StudentEthan Klein, Nuclear Science and Engineering PhD CandidateAdam Block, Mathematics PhD CandidateNavid Abedzadeh, EECS PhD CandidateDuc Hoang, Physics PhD StudentJeff Krupa, Physics PhD CandidateCharlotte Dai, Chemical Engineering PhD StudentMichael Cantara, Physics PhD CandidateAriel Attias, Civil Engineering PhD StudentMatthew R.
