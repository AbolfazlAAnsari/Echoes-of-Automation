I’m a second-year student from Edmonton, Alberta and I use she/her/hers pronouns. I’m in the Faculty of Arts and want to study English Literature and Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Social Justice. In my group of friends, I’m known for being overly opinionated, constantly complaining about my curtain bangs and looking like I’m a Vampire Weekend fan (I am, but what does that even mean?).\nSometimes we seek out our friends, our mom or even a Mitski song for some advice. But more often than not, we don’t want to ask those closest to us for help because, well, needing help can feel embarrassing — even though it never is.\nThat’s why I’m here! A university student giving advice to other university students so we can try to get by together. Emphasis on the “together.” Talk about camaraderie, right? It’s so easy to feel alone, especially on a campus of 55,000 people, but ifAsk Imanonly does one thing, I want it to show you that you’re not alone.\nAs my AP Chemistry teacher used to say, “If you have a question, I can guarantee that at least one other person has the same question, too,” and that class had only 11 students, so imagine how many people must be seeking out the same advice you are.\nIt’s a pretty good deal, if you ask me. You get advice and entertainment from the funniest person on campus. How could you go wrong?\nThe TL:DR version of this article is that I’m qualified to give you advice because I said so. And I got the go-ahead from Thomas, my editor, so I must be good. Right?\nSo, if you want to hear some jokes and get some damn good advice, you can just ask Iman (that’s me).\nYou’re doing great. Keep it up!\nNeed advice? Send your questions, queries or problems to advice@ubyssey.ca, or submit anonymously at ubyssey.ca/advice!\nShare this articlecopied!\nIman Janmohamedauthor\nCoordinating Editor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
