In total, Daily staffers were able to interview 71 community members, ranging from students — including undergraduates, graduate students and co-terms — to alumni and staff. We received an additional 200 responses through a survey.\nBased on these conversations and survey responses, The Daily’s Vol. 260 executive team and diversity, equity and inclusion co-chairs compiled ten takeaways that will inform our newsroom moving forward.\n\nWe thank everyone who contributed to our summer listening tour; we are immensely grateful for your willingness to help us grow. In addition to this public report, we’ll be distributing section-specific insights from the conversations and survey to our section editors. Though the tour itself may be over, our hope is that this outreach will not be an isolated event, but rather the start of an ongoing conversation between The Daily and the community that we serve. To that end, if you would like to continue this conversation, don’t hesitate toreach out, whether through sending in a tip, submitting an article or getting in touch via email.\nFrom,\nKate Selig, Vol. 260 Editor in Chief\nJeremy Rubin,Vol. 260 Executive Editor for Print\nLana Tleimat,Vol. 260 Executive Editor for Digital\nSarina Deb,Vol. 260 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Co-Chair\nJared Klegar,Vol. 260 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Co-Chair\nKate Selig served as the Vol. 260 editor in chief.
