            "inputText": "January 6 was a painful inflection point in our nation’s modern history. I know I’m not alone in feeling shocked and horrified at the violence that enveloped Capitol Hill, leading to the deaths offour loyal Trump supportersand Capitol Police officerBrian D. Sicknick, who died after allegedly being beaten in the head with a fire extinguisher. The nation will feel the aftermath of this tragedy for months, and perhaps years, to come.\r\nThere is no doubt that the events of January 6 will color the early days of the Biden administration as the country will undergo yet another impeachment trial for President Donald J. Trump once the articles are sent to the U.S. Senate. What’s less clear, yet equally important, is how the final days of the Trump administration will shape the long-term future of the Republican Party, a party that is still smarting from historic losses at the ballot box.\r\nThe Republican Party is the first incumbent party to lose the White House in nearlythree decades. Democrats gained House control in themidterm electionsdespite districtsgerrymanderedto cultivate a GOP majority, and Republican incumbents in the Senateforfeited their seatsin a stunning upset to two Democrats in a once-deep red Georgia. Whatever you think about the political talents and policy proposals of Reverend Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, their dual victory should be taken as nothing short of a five-alarm fire for a party now locked out of power in Congress for thefirst time in a decade.\r\nWhat is becoming more and more clear is that committing the party to fight a neverending “culture war” is not only a recipe for electoral rebuke from an increasingly socially liberal electorate, but a decision that will condemn the nation to a no-holds-barred race to the bottom of moral and intellectual desolation.\r\nThe GOP’s attacks on the legitimacy of American elections, coupled with broader trends in public opinion, don’t bode well for a party aimed at re-taking Congress and the White House in the near future. Although President Trumpoverperformedcompared to many expectations, his antagonism toward the media and barrage ofracist,xenophobic, andsexistattacks made it so that large swaths of the nation were already firmly set in opposition to Trump and his agendabefore he even took office. According toFiveThirtyEight, President Trump is the only modern American president to never hold an average approval rating above fifty-percent and it’s unclear if that was ever a goal of his administration.\r\nOne would think Republicans might be motivated to retreat from a strategy hyper-focused on conservative cultural grievances and conspiracy theories, because, well, it hasn’t been very successful. Almost 14 years ago during his reelection campaign, former President George W. Bush campaigned on ratifying a constitutional amendment toban same-sex marriage. Today, gay marriage is legal in all 50 states and it’s more popular than ever. When Gallup last asked the question in May 2020,two out of three Americans, and half of Republicans, believed that same-sex marriage should be legal. Yet opposition to same-sex marriagestill remainsin the Republican Party platform. Local governments and institutions continue to remove Confederate iconography fromstate flags,military bases, andpublic spacesdespite protests from many on the right. U.S. Attorney General Bill P. Barr candecrythe secularization of society all he wants, butless than halfof people now say that religion is “very important” to their lives, the lowest percentage since Gallup began asking the question in the early nineties. And as was proven in the Georgia runoffs, convincing the party’s base that their nation’s elections are hopelessly illegitimate is not the best “get out the vote” strategy.\r\nDuring the nation’s racial reckoning last summer, it appeared to become a right-wing in-group identifier to refuse to say “Black lives matter.” Reasonable people who care about racial justice lose patience with leaders who seem more concerned withinnocuous slogansand preservingconfederate monumentsthan with addressing the very real challenges that Black people in this country face. The Republican party can both celebrate and nurture the facets of our national tradition that make this country a“shining city on a hill”while acknowledging that this city has only shone for so many.\r\nI could go on, but in nearly every way, the GOP’s fight against social liberalism, from gay marriage to marijuana legalization, has been a complete and utter failure on the public opinion front. In response to this cultural lurch left, one would think those on the right would be desperately trying to understand and integrate conservative ideology into this new cultural dynamic. Instead, conservatives have ghettoized themselves into media ecosystems that insulate them from our changing culture.\r\nLike many liberals and moderates, I echo President-elect Joseph R. Biden’s view that the country needs a Republican party that is “principled and strong.” This country is changing faster than ever before and we need leaders who make us genuinely consider whether all those changes are good ones. But somewhere along the way, the Republican Party decided that it would simply be better to attack the happenings of this new American moment than to join in it as good faith partners wary of where a new direction might lead.\r\nThe Republican Party represents nearly half of American voters and has the opportunity to channel a robust intellectual movement that could dramatically change this nation for the better, but it is preoccupied with defining itself in diametric opposition to the morals of an electorate that is becoming increasingly socially progressive. As the nation enters a new juncture in our democracy, Republicans might want to dial back from the rhetoric of a culture war that has now reached a boiling point and focus on improving the material conditions of Americans who are struggling during new waves of joblessness and food insecurity.\r\nWhile the traditionalism that animates the GOP does not appear to be going away any time soon, the party might do itself a favor by being more judicious in which traditions it decides are worth fighting for (i.e. democracy), and which ones may no longer be compatible with American values in 2021 and beyond.\r\nGordon J.
