            "inputText": "The world order based on cooperative security and globalization became severely threatened on Feb. 24, 2022, when the Russian Federation attacked Ukraine, an independent and increasinglydemocratic nation. As Ukraine fearlessly fights for its future, the Harvard community has expressed its supportby conducting an anti-war rallyandamplifying the voices of Ukrainianson campus.\r\nIndeed, Harvard is known in the United States and abroad for this kind of advocacy. Fromraising emergency aid for displaced Afghansafter the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan  to takinga strong stance on racial injusticesduring the Black Lives Matter protests of summer 2020, Harvard students, as the citizen-leaders of tomorrow, lead the opinions in human rights circles nationwide and create an impact beyond campus. But today, the Harvard administration and the activists within the student body must be even more proactive in their advocacy for the Ukrainian cause, human rights, and global security than ever before.\r\nThe war in Ukraine is a unique 21st-century case of a people’s fight for the right to determine their future against an enemy that is several times larger. Ukrainians have inspired the world with their ability to withstand the attack for so long.\r\nWhat lies behind this determination are the values that every American holds dear. Ukraine prides itself on the unlimited freedoms to peacefully protest, criticize the government, and elect its public servants. Even as some neighboring post-Soviet countries slid back into authoritarianism, Ukraine managed to stay democratic, and its people have never been intimidated by a more powerful bully.\r\nBack in 2014, when the pro-Russian government restricted the right to protest,hundreds of thousands went to the streets, fighting for their right tospeak out. Ukrainian people put their lives on the line then — and continue to do so today — because democracy and the freedom to pursue your own social, cultural, and political development are at the center of the Ukrainian identity.\r\nThe Harvard student body should stand for Ukraine by using the privilege that Ukrainians are dying for: the democratic right to pressure the government for action. Students should write and call their local representatives and urge them to announce their support for Ukraine. The entire Harvard community must demand that elected officials speak out about the need for broader humanitarian and defense assistance and request support for ano-fly zone, an area over which Russian aircraft are not permitted to fly. This restriction entails shooting down Russian violators and will prevent Russia from using warplanes to attack civilians on the ground.\r\nAction is urgently needed to prevent massive human rights violations. Vladimir Putin’s quest for dominance yields unprecedented violations in Ukraine, and the country is presently on the brink of one of the biggest humanitarian crises that Europe has seen within the last few decades. Ukrainians trapped by Russian attackslack food and supplies, andthere have been allegations ofrising sexual violencein cities occupied by Russian invaders. Additionally, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations hasallegedthat Putin prepared a list of LGBTQI+ persons to be killed or sent to camps if he takes over Ukraine.\r\nCompanies in the United States that work with or in Russia indirectly support this immense suffering. The Harvard community should boycott companies that have ties with the Kremlin, and the student body should request that companies they work for restrict any business relations or partnerships with companies operating in Russia. The Harvard administration needs to release information on whether the University has any indirect investments in Russia, and if any exist, suspend those immediately.\r\nLastly, activists must act now to prevent a war in other European countries. Putin has not only laid out a threat to Ukrainian borders but also put forth a vision of an imperial Russia. In his November 2021addressto the Russian people,  Putin stated that some republics that were once a part of the Soviet Union have unjustifiably been given independence, forcing us to confront the inevitable question: Who is next? Which other independent European country will Putin destroy in his quest for power? Will he lay a claim on Baltic countries that were formerly a part of the Soviet Union, and are presently a part of NATO? Harvard students must join protests and show support to Ukraine not only for the sake of Ukraine, but also to prevent a catastrophe in other European countries.\r\nThe leaders of tomorrow should not stay idle in the face of this global danger. As a proud Ukrainian American, I offer Harvard a clear call for activism: Everyone in this community must use their power to stand for freedom, protect humanity against an emerging authoritarian regime, and help defend world peace.\r\nAnna Koch graduated from the Harvard Extension School in 2020."
