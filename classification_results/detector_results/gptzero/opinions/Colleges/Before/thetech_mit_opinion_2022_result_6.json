Despite the administrationâ€™s claims, the existing avenues accessible by student groups like the SVA,Graduate Student Council, orBlack Graduate Student Associationdo not have sufficient power to affect change on behalf of graduate student-workers. As theleaders of these organizations will attest, student groups have the power to make suggestions for improvement, but without the accountability our union would provide, MIT often delays acting on or completely dismisses student feedback. By forming a union, graduate student-workers at MIT can ensure that our problems are taken seriously by MIT administration and that our rights are protected by a legally enforceable contract.\nMIT is failing to meet the federal expectations they agreed to. Having the VA benefits that veterans are entitled to at MIT would make the institution more accessible for all veterans. I would be spending less time worried about my finances and more time focused on my coursework and research. Join me bysigning your union cardtoday and voting yes on forming a union."
