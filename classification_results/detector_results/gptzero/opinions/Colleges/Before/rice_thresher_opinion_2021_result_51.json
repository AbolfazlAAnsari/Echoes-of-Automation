In any case, it was such a warm (literally) reminder for myself how generous and kind the Rice community is.\nI stood in line with my mom, a Rice professor, for two and a half hours, with no certainty about whether or not my mother would actually receive care. It was 18 degrees with a windchill that made it feel like nine. It was bleak and it was hopeful: imagine telling my grandparents we nabbed my mom a vaccine on the first real snow day we’ve experienced in 24 years of living in Houston.\nMy mom made a joke about the opportunity for an enterprising student to make a few bucks selling coffee. A few minutes later, someone came around with a box full of snacks.That was fast, I thought. But then more and more students came by, giving up what I’d imagined would be the rarest Houston snow day spent napping and watching “Gilmore Girls” reruns to pace the 1,000+ person line offering snacks and hot drinks. One student gave me a banana muffin. Another brought around tissues and fresh masks. One handed out hot cocoa that she had mixed herself. Then a trio came around with a whole sleeve of insulated cups and a hot water carafe, followed by another person with a trough to take away trash. When we were within yards of the gym’s entrance, I took a box of Golden Grahams (which I certainly haven’t eaten since I was seven) from a bin that I think I saw Lovett College Magister Mike Gustin bring over with a few students (if it was you, hi Mike!) to stress eat for the final crawl. While the vaccines ran out before us, it was one of the few times in the last year where I felt part of a community of people, generously helping each other persevere and hold on to the hope that what we all want and need so badly is within reach if we stick it out together. It was also just really nice. You reminded me that there are good humans — strangers — who will cheer you on when you need it.\nThank you.\nEmily Nichol\nWiess College ’13\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
