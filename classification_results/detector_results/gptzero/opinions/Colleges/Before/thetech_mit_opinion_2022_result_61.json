On Feb. 2, the chancellor and provost wrote to MIT’s faculty with a set of talking points with which to address their graduate students, along with a list of do’s and don’ts to ensure compliance with the National Labor Relations Act. Among the talking points is this:\n“For example, it is permitted for a faculty member to say that they do not wish to see a graduate student union come to MIT or that they hope the union will be defeated. As long as there are no threats or promises, a supervisor or faculty member may freely express their opinion at any time. They may engage fully in a campaign to inform students about the union and/or persuade students to vote against the union.”\nMoreover, the vice chancellor has attended at least one departmental faculty meeting to encourage faculty to oppose unionization. These actions are distressing to us as they violate the spirit of neutrality needed to “ensure that faculty-student relationships will not be adversely affected, regardless of the outcome of the organizing process” (IWER letter).\nIn thecurrent issue of the Faculty Newsletter, one of the authors of the IWER letter notes that while the content of the talking points “is within the law, having faculty (who exercise considerable power regarding the careers of their grad students) counsel with their grad students may not honor the maxim: ‘Let the students decide.’”\nWe call on faculty to avoid, even if unintentional, the appearance of coercion. We pledge to not attempt to persuade graduate students how to vote on unionization and to avoid presenting one-sided views for or against unionization. We also pledge to work collaboratively with graduate students in research and teaching, as befits the MIT mission, regardless of the outcome of the unionization vote next month.\nWe encourage other faculty tosign our open letter.\nSigned:\nEdmund BertschingerProfessor of Physics and faculty affiliate, Program in Women’s and Gender Studies\nSally HaslangerFord Professor of Philosophy and Women’s and Gender Studies, School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences\nThomas KochanProfessor Emeritus, MIT Sloan School of Management and Institute for Work and Employment Research\nPhil ThompsonAssociate Professor of Urban Studies and Planning"
