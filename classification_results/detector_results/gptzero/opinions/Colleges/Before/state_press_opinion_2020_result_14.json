If you are an out-of-state student, consider registering to vote in Arizona, aswing statewhich will likely prove a decisive win for one of the Presidential candidates.\nArizona hastraditionally beena red state, and the last five elections prove it. Butrecent pollshave given Democratic nominee Joe Biden a four-point margin over President Donald Trump. In 2016, Trumpnarrowly wonthe state by similar margins.\nA major factor in this year’s election will likely be the student vote, which has increased slowly over time. A report from Tufts University said college student turnoutincreased from 45.1% to 48.3%from the 2012 election to 2016. Between the COVID-19 pandemic and social justice movements, there's a good chance turnout will be even higher this November.\nAnother critical factor is the Latino voter population. \"We have a growing Hispanic population in Arizona and people who are Hispanic are probably at least two to one times more likely to vote for the Democratic party,\" said David Wells, an ASU political science senior lecturer.\nPew Research CenterreportsArizona’s Hispanic population is 31%, the fourth largest Hispanic population in the U.S. and growing. As Latino and Hispanic voterstend to lean left, this population could play a decisive role in defeating the incumbent.\n“The gradually changing demographic in Arizona has the effect of increasingly making the state move in a Democratic party direction,\" Wells said.\nIn addition to the presidential race, Arizona's senatorial election is hotly contested. If Democrat Mark Kelly defeats Republican incumbent Martha McSally, Arizona's election could contribute to a flip in the Senate from a Republican majority to Democrat. Currently, Republicans hold 53 seats while the Democrats hold 47. In this upcoming election,35 seats are up for grabs, and 23 are held by Republicans.\nIn 2018,Democrat Kyrsten Sinema won the Senate race against McSallyby 2.4 points, making her thefirst Democrat to win a Senate race in Arizona since 1988. This made Sinema Arizona's first female senator and the first openly bisexual senator. Following the race, McSally was appointed to the Senate after former Arizona senator John McCain died.\nNow that McSally's seat is up for grabs, a Kelly win would officially flip Arizona representation in the Senate blue and change the course of Arizonan politics.\nVoting as an out-of-state student in Arizona can be \"a little more complicated than other states,\" Wells said. You canrequest an absentee ballot, but some states have deadlines and you wouldn't be voting for Arizonan candidates.\nTo do so, one must be considered an Arizona resident. This isdefinedas \"an individual who has an actual physical presence in the state and the intent to remain in the state.\" Registering to vote in Arizona also requires proof of citizenship, whether this be a legitimate birth certificate or passport, which most students may have left back home.\nThe deadline to register to vote in the state of Arizona is Oct. 5.
