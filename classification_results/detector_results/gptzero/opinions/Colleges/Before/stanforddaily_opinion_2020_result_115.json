            "inputText": "Content warning: state violence, COVID-19, death\nA prison sentence during a COVID-19 outbreak is a death sentence. The conditions that exist within prisons, jails and detention centers —overcrowding, lack of sanitation and high populations of elderly and immunocompromised people — make already devastating COVID-19 outbreaks worse.And just as experts feared, just 50 miles north of Stanford, the third largest outbreak in the nationhas eruptedin San Quentin State Prison, with over one-third of the incarcerated population testing positive for COVID-19.\nThis is acrisis— a crisis reflective of anti-Blackness and medical racism; a crisis of public health and safety; and a crisis of human rights. Worst of all, this COVID-19 outbreak at San Quentin is a crisis that was completely preventable.\nSan Quentin’s outbreak can be traced to May 30th when the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR)negligently transferred 121 menfrom California Institute for Men, a known COVID-19 hotspot, to San Quentin. While everyone who transferred had previously tested negative for COVID-19 (in many cases their tests were conducted2-4 weeks before the transfer),none of the transfers were tested upon arrival. On May 30th, San Quentin had 0 confirmed cases.Today, just over a month later, it has more than 1400 confirmed cases, a likely underestimate since there has been no comprehensive testing available.\nAt San Quentin, we see once again how government negligence results in violence inflicted upon Black lives. To be clear, the state government’s actions have put thousands of people’s lives inmortal danger.Approximately 1400 of the people incarcerated at San Quentin have at least one COVID-19 risk factor.300 of them have four or more COVID-19 risk factors.The antiquated state facilities built nearly two centuries ago, poor ventilation, lack of essential cleaning and hygiene supplies, and overcrowding at San Quentin (some blocks already nearing 200% capacity) make itvirtually impossible to properly control the outbreakand protect people’s lives. James King, a formerly incarcerated community leader and now State Campaigner at Ella Baker Center, stated that “the quality of life in San Quentin has never been worse, certainly in the last 100 years.”\nThis failure of the state government will also be felt outside of the prison system. Faculty from UCSF and UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health, who toured the San Quentin facilities in June, arewarningthat a failure to control this outbreak immediately could easily flood and overwhelm San Quentin and even Bay Area hospitals.  With every passing moment, the crisis only grows more serious. Governor Gavin Newsom and the CDCR need to take immediate action to protect their lives.\nTherefore as the ASSU Executives, we stand in solidarity with the organizers of#StopSanQuentinOutbreak;Ella Baker Center for Human Rights,Restore Justice,Asian Prisoner Support Committee – APSC,the Incarcerated Community of San Quentin, Stanford’sPrison Renaissance Projectand the many loved ones of those inside San Quentin. We endorse their demands and demand the following:\nAlong with our statement of solidarity, we also call upon willing and able members of the Stanford community to speak up about this crisis in the following ways:\nAdmin and Faculty\nStudents, Alumni and Community Members\nWe firmly believe that it is our moral responsibility to use our positions to advocate for an end to this human rights and public health crisis. As students, alumni, faculty, and administrators of Stanford,’ we must individually and collectively take action and call upon our government to secure the health, safety, and human rights of those incarcerated in our prison system.\nSigned,\nMunira Alimire ’22, ASSU President 2020-2021\nVianna Vo ’21, (she/her), ASSU Vice President 2020-2021\nJianna So ’21, (she/her), ASSU Chief of Staff 2020-2021\nWill Shan ’22, (he/him), ASSU Co-Director of COVID-19 Response 2020-2021\nAdonis Rubio ’21, (he/him), ASSU Co-Director of COVID-19 Response 2020-2021\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and  letters to the editor.
