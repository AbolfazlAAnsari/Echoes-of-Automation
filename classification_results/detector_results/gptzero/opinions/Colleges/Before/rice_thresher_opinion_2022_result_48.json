The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors.\nResponding to the Rice Thresher reporter Bonnie Zhao reporting on the relocation of the WMR statue on January 25, 2022 “Rice to move Founder’s Memorial within Academic Quadrangle”:\nWe are a group of Rice alumni, students and community activists who have been protesting since Aug. 31, 2020 due to the leadership of Shifa Rahman, a Rice student who has been continuously holding peaceful sit-ins at the statue each day at 5pm.  Our sit-ins have also attracted the attention of several groups outside of Rice such as the nonprofitsPure JusticeandIndivisible Houston, Exploitation Free Zonesand outside university student groups such as Decolonization at Brown (University). Many student groups inside Rice have also been openly supportive.  We have also been featured inThe Houston Chronicle, Houston PressandTexas Tribune.\nThe toxic racial trauma we experienced as did many of our alumni and current students is manifested in our daily lives because this statue represents an era which still applies to us — the fear, insecurity, anger, frustration and sadness that while we are good enough to enter Rice and sit with the white students, we will never be fully accepted and truly belong to this campus.  Having an old white enslaver lord over us from his perch only serves to harm and stymie our intellectual growth, doesn’t assist and harms Rice’s motto of “unconventional wisdom”  and leads to a lack of belonging and true inclusivity.  How exactly can a student or alumni of color feel accepted being on the campus, especially as a Black student walking by this statue on a daily basis?\nWe applaud the report released by the Task Force of Slavery, Segregation and Racial Injustice to remove the statue and we are glad that our Board has agreed with the report and will be relocating the statue and have support from the Student Association. However, we are concerned about the timeline as well as other pertinent concerns regarding the relocation process.\nWe are hopeful that our new President is willing to create a constructive and inclusive dialogue with us in person.   We would like to invite our new President, Reginald Des Roches to sit with us at the statue from Monday through Friday.  Sit with us, Mr. President, and let’s discuss the relocation plans together.\nGautam Nayer, Ph.D., Glasscock alum ’19, Texas Southern University professor\nKeShawn Ivory, Wiess ’18, Ph.D. student at Vanderbilt\nShifa Abdul-Rahman, Lovett College senior\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
