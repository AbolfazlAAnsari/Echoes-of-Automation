This was a historic moment, as Kamala Harris is poised to become the first woman, the first Black person and the first South Asian person to hold the office of vice president.\nFor many, the election results were cause for celebration — or at least relief. For others, including those with political views to both the right and to the left of the president-elect, an incoming Biden administration was no reason to pop champagne bottles.\nRegardless of political leanings, it felt like we were waiting forever for Nov. 3 to arrive. And now that it’s come and gone, feelings of happiness, disappointment, or a mix of both may feel like they’re settling in for good. But the work did not end on Saturday. Your work, whatever it may be, should continue.\nIn the months leading up to the election, and in the years that have unfolded during the presidency of Donald Trump, Rice students have put in work for the political causes they believe in. The Rice University Young Democrats and the Rice University College Republicans have debated against each other,supportedopposing candidates andworked togetheron voter registration drives. Following the 2016 election,Civic Duty Ricecame onto the scene to offer students a nonpartisan path to getting involved politically, andRice Lefthas shown up in recent years to provide leftist students with a space to discuss and organize. There have been shorter-lived groups organizing around particular candidates —Rice Students for Beto,Owls for Bernieand most recently,Rice for Biden(and the short-lived Rice Against Biden).\nOutside the realm of explicit political organizing, Rice students have also coalesced to take action on issues of social and racial justice on campus. In the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, which ushered in a reckoning with racial injustice across the nation, students organized to createRice for Black Lifein May and hosted remote fundraisers to support local Black liberatory organizations. Around the same time, Black students also circulated alist of demandsto improve Black students’ access and visibility on campus, foster greater racial sensitivity among administrative and residential entities and make Rice’s curriculum more inclusive. Students have taken those demands into their own hands by adamantly protesting for the removal of the Founder’s Memorial statue withdaily sit-ins,projections, anopen letter to the administrationandlocal media coverage.Students have also looked after our community withRice Mutual Aid, by supporting the Houston Coalition for Equitable Development Without Displacement and in a number of other ways not listed in this editorial.\nWe have implored the administration totake decisive action to meet those demandsandpublicly respond to the protests against the statue, and we reiterate those charges now. Furthermore, we implore students to resist seeing these efforts as issues of the past or battles that have been won — our community needs continued energy and support from students.\nMoreover, we urge everyone on and off campus to channel any energy you had surrounding the election toward causes you believe in. There will be more elections (this one isn’t even over), and there will also be more voter suppression, natural disasters, gentrification and communities who need help. Whatever work you do to help your community, don’t lose sight of the change you wish to see and keep going.\nWhile Biden’s campaign ran on promises ofdiversity and inclusion, his administration will not magically erase the long-standing social inequalities that have boiled to the surface over the last four years. Whether you support the president-elect or not, this shift in leadership is no reason to become complacent in the issues plaguing the nation and the Rice community.\nEditor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Rishab Ramapriyan, Ivanka Perez, Amy Qin, Elizabeth Hergert, Ella Feldman, Katelyn Landry, Rynd Morgan, Savannah Kuchar, Ben Baker-Katz, Simona Matovic and Tina Liu.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
