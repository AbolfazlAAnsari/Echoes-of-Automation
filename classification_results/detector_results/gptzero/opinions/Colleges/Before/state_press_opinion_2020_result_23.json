            "inputText": "\"Dear State Press, you've got mail.\" Illustration published on Friday, March 3, 2017.\nASU College Republicans president Joe Pitts recently submitteda letterto The State Pressclaiming that he and his club support the immigrant community. Students for Socialism affirms that this move is nothing more than a performative stunt.\nAs a political club that has been actively involved in the affairs of ASU’s community, we will not let their empty rhetoric go unanswered.\nLike their parent party, ASU College Republicans, have consistently been silent or outright inflammatory on issues which affect the migrant community.\nDuring the Border Patrol protests during April of last year, they were silent. In November, ASU College Republicans petulantly mocked the righteous anger of immigrant students who prevented Immigration and Customs Enforcement from recruiting on campus.\nCollege Republicans said nothing when Joe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff who was found guilty of racial discrimination and the mass deportation of immigrants,came to campus.\nCollege Republicans actively stoodin oppositionto the movement for Palestinian liberation. They loudly opposed the anti-racist, anti-colonial efforts of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against the apartheid state of Israel.\nFurthermore, no foreign student or migrant rights groups on campus were referenced in their letter. Many such organizations exist on campus, such asUndocumented Students for Educational Equity, theCoalition of International Studentsand many others.\nIn addition to this hypocrisy, the rhetoric in the CR article serves to puff up American exceptionalism. As Pitts states, “We exceed all other nations across the world in our acceptance of foreign migrants.”  This twaddle completely ignores the fact that migrants are fleeing their home countries because of the brutal violence andplunderperpetrated by the U.S. and its fellow imperialists the world over.\nThe U.S. is clearly responsible for the influx of Honduran migrants, as U.S. involvement in coups in the region spurred chaos and worsened the conditions of an already suffering Latin America. Wars backed by the U.S. also cause refugee crises, such as the ongoing destruction in Yemen where years of carpet bombing, drone strikes, and allyship to Saudi Arabia have led to what is now internationally recognized as a dire humanitarian crisis.\nPitts is not a migrant himself. He consulted no migrants in the process of writing this article. His opinions are unsubstantiated by the facts. In reality, this nation reflects the absolute poorest treatment of immigrants. From the creation of ICE and Border Patrol, locking kids in literalconcentration camps, theseparation of Latin American migrant families, to the Chinese Exclusion act, and even Japanese internment camps — U.S. history and the Trump administration’s policy utterly falsify Pitts' claim.\nPitts’s claims about American acceptance of immigrants only applies to people who migrate here “the legal way”. These categorizations based on legality only serve to dehumanize migrants and provide the basis to imprison and deport people by the thousands, hardly an acceptable way to treat any human being.\nThe most laughable part, however, was saved for the end of the piece. The inclusion of a quote from Ronald Reagan,a poster child for U.S. interference in Latin Americaanddisrespect for marginalized communities, displays how out-of-touch and ungenuine Pitts’ article is. It is nothing more than a series of nice words to distract from the fact that his party supports these violent, right-wing policies.\nEditor’s Note: The opinions presented in this letter to the editor are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement fromThe State Press or its editors.
