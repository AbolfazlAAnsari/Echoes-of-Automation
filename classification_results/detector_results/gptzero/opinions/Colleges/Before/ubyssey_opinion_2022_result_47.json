Through the ASAP, the AMS plans on developing plant-based menus and promoting OceanWise food products, while reducing the availability of single-use items and increasing the availability of reusable foodware options. The AMS also wants to transition to local suppliers or suppliers whose collection and transportation methods have a “limited impact on the environment.”\nThe AMS also trains team members in proper waste sorting procedures, according to the ASAP.\nThe AMS plans to advocate for more affordable on-campus student housing and investing in food insecurity-related programs at UBC by using the AMS Housing Service to help students find affordable housing and ensuring that AMS Student Services can support students going through financial hardships, according to the ASAP.\nThe plan also states the AMS should increase its funding and support for student mental health programs. The ASAP uses a peer-support model to advance student mental health and wellbeing. It also mentions improving existing wellbeing services related to equity and inclusion, women empowerment, healthy masculinity, sexuality, substance use and student safety.\nThe ASAP calls for ensuring the continued operation of the AMS Sexual Assault Support Centre.\nASAP advocacy and leadership-related goals include creating more accessible physical activity programming and advocating for more accessible and sustainable transportation options at UBC and around Metro Vancouver.\nThe ASAP mentions efforts to continue working on the Dashboard — a software tool used to display sustainability-related metrics at the Nest. The report also states the AMS should create more opportunities for students to provide feedback around sustainability.\nThe AMS wants to work toward increasing the number of applications received for the Sustainable Projects Fund and support both AMS and non-AMS student groups in sustainability efforts.\nThe document also says the AMS should continue its formal partnerships with UBC’s Social Ecological Economic Development Studies (SEEDS) and Sustainability Ambassadors programs. Further collaboration with the University Sustainability Initiative and UBC Campus and Community Planning was also encouraged.\nThe Indigenous coordination section of the ASAP was not included in the final report. The AMS stated that it would work with the AMS Indigenous Committee to create the Indigenous coordination section together to include at a later date.\nThe ASAP also mentioned working with UBC to create more programming centered on sustainability. The plan also emphasized working closely with student groups like the Student Environment Center and the Climate Hub.\nThe ASAPs next review will occur in 2023.\nUnwreck the BeachisThe Ubyssey’s sustainability column.
