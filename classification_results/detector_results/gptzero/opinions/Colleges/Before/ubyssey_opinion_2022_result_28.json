So, I got rid of Blankie for you. He was my best friend, my confidant, my partner-in-crime. We did everything together. He was Boots to my Dora. He stayed in my backpack when it was time for class. I only brought it to school once, though. Mom and Remi say I should be a big girl. I’m ten and puberty hit me like a truck. You gave me pimples, boobs and armpit hair. So now I give you Blankie. His final resting place is the blue shed at the side of our house.\nNow that I’ve given you Blankie, I, of course, am going to need some things in return. My pastor said if you give to God, he’ll send blessings in return. First thing first, I need a new Nintendo D.S Lite. Can it be Black like my old one? I tried to sell my first one, but I broke it instead. I took out the battery and was going to sell them separately to Matthew Mattia. He didn’t know it was going to be sold separately and now hates me, but business is business. He broke it on the tarmac under the basketball net. It would be great if I could get it for Christmas or my birthday.\nThe next thing on my list is an iPod touch. Everyone at church has one. We are all the body of Christ and should be treated equally, right? Right, good. Christmas or birthday. I would separate these gifts, though. I don’t want my mom getting suspicious. I assume that all this stuff is gonna come through here and I don’t want my mom second-guessing her good deeds.\nThe last thing is a phone. Now, if you want, you can replace the iPod with the phone, I don’t mind. I like the Samsung S3. I’m Team Android all day. Plus, if I get an iPod, I can have the best of both worlds. I know this is a lot… actually, nevermind. You parted the Red Sea and made Jesus walk on water! A Samsung is nothing. Anyways, thanks for listening.\nSincerely,\nStephanie\nHello God,\nI need a new best friend, but it seems like all the best friends are taken. Joy was my first choice. We run ‘buy me McDonald’s’ schemes during my mom’s choir practice, so it only seems fitting that we jump into the next phase in our relationship. But, she’s best friends with Ariana. Abi was my second choice, by the way. I met Abi before Joy and we share a deep connection. We only meet on Sundays, but our bond strengthened due to my comedic nature. They both laugh at my jokes but don’t want to be my best friends.\nI want a best friend that’s as funny as me. I want her to laugh at my jokes and I want us to talk about everything. She has to be a girl, of course. My mom would act like I was getting married if I had a boy best friend. I can imagine my mom screaming, “Stephy, where’s your husband?”\nShe can be real annoying sometimes.\nI pray that she makes me laugh and is kind. I want us to talk on the phone all the time and share secrets with one another. She can be from anywhere too — Ghana, Nigeria, Ethiopia — I don’t care. As long as we share a love forSuper Mario 64, I’m down for whatever. She doesn’t need a D.S. We can share mine. Well, I mean, she can use mine. She can’t take it home or something. And we can’t share mine unless I get a new one for Christmas. Or my birthday.\nI wonder what she’ll look like. Will she be tall? Maybe she’ll like basketball. God, make her like basketball! I don’t watch it all the time, but it’s fun to play. I’d show her all my favourite TV shows,The Fresh Prince,Everybody Hates ChrisandMy Wife And Kids. She probably already knowsThat’s So RavenandThe Proud Family. I want her to be the Carlton to my Will.\nI’d like to meet her soon, please. Not having a best friend is tiresome. I want us to have matching braids and cornrows. I want them covered in jewels and beads. They might scratch our faces when we run and play, but that’s okay. Thanks for listening\nStephanie\nYou are the Am that I Am,\nThe Beginning and the End.\nHow I worship You\nI kneel before You in splendour,\nand gaze upon Your throne.\n\nYahweh!I call\nYou answer me with horns,\nAnd serenade me with trumpets\nI dance before the angels\nA smile graces Your face\n\nHow I love Thee\nThe only Father I’ve ever known\nYour warmth surrounds me\nAs Your light brightens the shadows\nAnd Your voice beams through the noise\nHosanna\n\nWhen I speak,\nYou listen.\nYou’ve always been close.\nI recite your ways\nAnd heed your words\nI do my best to obey.\n\nI know you’ll never leave me.\nI know you’ll never forsake me.\nFor your words hold truth.\nThank you for this day\nThank you for the birds chirping and blue skies.\nYou made the clouds swirl together, perfect ivory.\n\nI sit on a stoop, taking it all in.\nI watch the squirrels run up and down the trees.\nLaughing at the sight of them fighting for nuts and pine cones.\nThe screams of children fill my ears\nThey race around the park,\nLeaping off the swing sets, trying to fly.\n\nThe men play soccer\nThe field becomes their sanctuary\nThe women cheering on the side become their choir.\nGo! Go! Go!\n\nI catch my fellow teenagers dancing from the corner of my eye.\nThey rehearse their TikTok dances in the parking lot.\nThe sun bounces off their skin,\nGiving them a radiant glow.\n\nThe homeless man laughs with his friends.\nThey pitch a tent in the corner.\nThey slap the mosquitoes as they land on the bare skin.\n\nI stretch myself across the grassy floor\nAnd think of the ways you’ve been good to me.\nDear God,\n\nThere are two Canadas.\nOne of vigour and one of isolation.\nMy joints pop as I’m stretched between the two.\nI’m sent down the path of the broken because of the colour of my skin.\nMy lack of money keeps me there.\nBut, my birthright makes its way to me, education.\nIt holds me and equips me with the grace to tell Black Canada’s story,\nAnd show the world my own.\nDear God,\n\nMy ancestors are struck by the master’s whip.\nTheir flesh burns under the southern sun.\nWhere were you when all this was happening?\nWhere was our Moses?\n\nMarie Angelique’s leg was crushed by the Brodequin.\nThrough the pain, she confessed to the crime.\nBut what crime was that Father?\nSetting fire to Old Montreal was her birthright,\nHer right of passage.\nWhere was her Red Sea?\n\nI’m told to get over it.\n“It was a long time ago,” Mother says.\nOur lineage stayed in Nigeria, so my mother’s sympathy is thin.\nBut I can’t get over it.\nWhere were you?\nDear God,\nI’m mad at you. You knew how Africans would find out about Your Word, and You let it happen. You’re supposed to hope, but instead, You aided in Africa’s destruction. I wonder about the Israelites. How they were enslaved under Pharaoh for hundreds of years. You brought them from their destruction and positioned them to be Your Holy people. You led them to the promised land as a cloud in the day and a torch in the night. Why couldn’t You do the same for us? Was it because we were pagans and had to be taught a lesson? You left us to suffer, and we’ve been suffering ever since.\nI think of my mother, who douses herself with bleach cream to get ready to enter your holy sanctuary every Sunday. She’s already light-skinned, but she itches for more; she chases after whiteness. Do you know how that makes me feel? The foundation of my life succumbs to the frail image of western beauty as she adjusts her favourite blonde wig. Are you happy with her? Are you satisfied with us?\nYours truly,\nStephanie Okoli\nWhat are we now, dear Lord?\nYour distant,\nYou don’t talk to me anymore.\nI guess that’s fitting since I pushed you away.\nI did it in anger, fury.\nYou left my people to die.\nYou were never supposed to forsake me.\nI want us to start over.\nI want to love You.\nDear God,\nWe’re life partners. I get that now. It was hard to see you or feel you before. The aching sensation of regret and pain flowed out of me during prayer. I could never reach you like I did before. Our connection was broken. The thing that mended our severed lifeline was trust. When my back was against the wall, I cried out to you, and you opened my eyes. You showed me Your plan for me. I demonstrated that you haven’t forgotten me. So, I stretch my arms out to You and smile. I sense your embrace. You’ve given me a new Blankie and new friends. You’ve given my mom a new direction in life. Thank you.\nSincerely,\nStephanie Okoli\n\nBlack Voices at UBCis an open-form column publishing work by Black writers in UBC’s student community.
