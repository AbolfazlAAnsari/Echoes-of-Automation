While this option offers a promising solution to fall quarter instruction, it begs the question of who should get to come to campus in fall, if anyone at all.\nUC President Janet Napolitano toldCNBCthat each UC campus must meet certain requirements to reopen in the fall, which includescontact tracing programsand COVID-19testing for students, faculty and staff. These measures are in place toflatten the curveof infected cases, as well as to trace the virus if a campus outbreak should occur. UCLA isplanning to allow studentsto attend classes in person or online due to housing issues as a result of travel restrictions and safety procedures. A grim reality is that UCI will face similar housing issues, although the school hasn’t announced any plans for in-person or hybrid options for continuing students.\nThis raises a more nuanced question regarding the reopening of campus: who will be able to attend in-person classes when they are eventually offered? It is inevitable that the UC’s plan to trace infections and offer testing will be required by UCI, but we must also develop a plan on how to slowly introduce the student population back onto campus. A sudden, full repopulation may spark a COVID-19 outbreak which will re-close campus and displace students and faculty/staff for a second time this year. Because of this, allowing seniors and housing-insecure upper division students on campus should be prioritized over allowing the general freshman population to decide whether or not to live near campus.\nOffering in-person classes during the fall 2020 quarter will be a tricky puzzle to solve, especially when considering that flattening the curve of infections is completely dependent on our willingness to comply withfederal health advisories. Unfortunately, COVID-19 cases have spiked inOrange Countyas of May 1 due to protests fighting the federally mandated stay-at-home order and beach closures. California isslowly reopening businessesas well, with a plan to keep future infections at a minimum. The unpredictable nature of the current situation regarding currently unknown cases, future cases and civil unrest leaves the educational system in a very defensive and safety-oriented position.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has developed a four-phase plan for reopeningCalifornia in the wake of the virus, which involves gradually lifting closures of businesses and venues as the virus declines in new infections. UCI should follow a similar plan. Phases should be used temporally but also to create on-campus priority based on class year and then more nuanced eligibility thresholds.\nPhase one, for example, should take place in the fall, with seniors being the first offered in-person spots for available hybrid classes. More nuanced requirements, such as GPA, can be considered if spots fill up, and spots for lower division students should only open if all upper division students who meet the eligibility requirements have accepted or declined their spots first. During the course of the 2020-2021 year, phase two and subsequent phases would give access to a larger campus population in line with the government’s strategic lift on stay-at-home orders. There are obviously outstanding circumstances such as students of all years facing insecure housing, students with special needs, lower division students already marooned near campus, and other situations that could bypass the general rule and those should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\nThis is an unfair time for everyone and no system will be completely perfect. We are all struggling to react and recuperate from the pandemic’s tragic grip on the U.S. and abroad. Although we are all working our hardest to mitigate the virus’s reach, UCI needs to reopen its physical campus not only in a highly strategic manner but also in a way that is fair to its dedicated student population. Priority for who can attend in-person fall classes needs to be given to upper division students, not just students who can meet basic safety eligibility requirements required by the UC system in order to foster a steady return to the normal campus environment that we all fight so hard to be a part of.\nDavid Andrews is an Opinion Intern for the 2020 spring quarter.
