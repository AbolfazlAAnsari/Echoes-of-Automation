Though this is a step toward opening up a conversation on the efforts of Indigenous people throughout history, it still does not address the current struggles of Indigenous communities in North America. To truly acknowledge Indigenous people and their diverse cultures, Biden and the nation need to reckon with the past and better support indigenous communities through government legislation and programs rather than just creating a national holiday.\nIt’s imperative that we acknowledge the Indigenous activists across the country who have fought for the implementation of this holiday on a national level. It is equally important to address theissues impacting Indigenous householdseveryday, such as high rates of poverty, lack of academic resources for Indigenous youth, unhealthy living conditions, environmental racism, cultural appropriation, violence against women, those who identify as Two-spirit and much more.\nAccording todata from Poverty USA in 2018, Indigenous Americans experienced the highest rates of poverty at 25.4%.Around one in 10 Indigenous Americansdo not have access to clean water. The idea that Indigenous Americans receive “free handouts” from the government such asmonthly checks or free housingsimply for being Indigenous is far from the truth. When culturalassumptions such as these are widespreadacross the nation it diminishes and distracts from the problems Indigenous communities face.\nEnvironmental racism is also a contributing factor to the issues Indigenous communities face on a daily basis. Whether it’s theDakota Access Pipelineor theAgua Caliente case, Indigenous communities have had their native land and environment disrupted for the sake of corporate profits. These lands hold sacred and cultural significance for their communities, and corporations exploiting them to their advantage is insulting to the history and importance of their land and culture.\nAnother crucial issue impacting Indigenous communities has to do with their cultural perceptions throughout history. Education related to Indigenous cultures in America has been one-sided and simply the bare minimum. In history classes, most Americans are taught only ahandful of significant Indigenous American events; however, most of these are focused on Indigenous peoples’ suffering instead of their contributions to American society and progress throughout history. Not to mention that manyIndigenous students in school feel underrepresented, unwelcomeand are unable to benefit from the necessary academic resources to succeed.Misrepresentation in the mediaalong with the increase in cultural appropriation have also contributed to a skewed perception of the average Indigenous American.\nTheMissing and Murdered Indigenous Womxn, Girls, and Two Spirit(MMIWG2S) movement has brought attention to a severe issue impacting women and gender non-conforming Indigenous people.According to the National Institute of Justice(NIJ), “more than four in five American Indian and Alaska Native women and men have experienced violence in their lifetime.” With widespread violence and movements calling for justice, the government needs to step in with solutions. Fortunately,Biden took initiative in May 2021, proclaiming a Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day as well as prioritizing this issue by working directly with tribal nations.\nWhile it’s important to shed light on the issues they face, it is also important to focus on how they have shaped America’s culture and identity. Indigenous Americans have contributed to American history in many ways, whether it’s inagriculture,medicine,technology,warfareand more. We received many of ourfood practicesfrom Indigenous communities. We continue to learn from Indigenous communities onhow to respect our environmentand fight for environmental justice.\nWe shouldn’t forget the contributions of Indigenous Americans throughout our history and we shouldn’t dismiss this important holiday; however, we all need to dig deeper and learn about the diverse histories and cultures of Indigenous tribes. Talk to Indigenous people and activists. Amplify their voices and advocate for indigenious-focused issues. Biden has made some steps forward in representing Indigenous peoples, but there’s still a long way to go.\nCamelia Heins is an Opinion Intern for the fall 2021 quarter.
