The views expressed in this opinion are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors.\nAs the election approaches, we are undoubtedly aware of the presidential ticket. However, there are 45 more races that are going to appear on our ballots — all of them crucial elected positions that form the basis of Harris County. Each time we vote, we shape not just our country but also our local municipalities. These candidates are the people who directly determine what life looks like for Rice University and the Houstonians surrounding us — in terms of criminal justice, our tax dollars and our environment.\nThat is why it is of the utmost importance to create an informed voting plan for the down-ballot races beyond federal races. This upcoming election can impact Harris County’s criminal justice policies, education policies and local infrastructure — and especially our climate future.\nThe railroad commissioner oversees the regulation of mining, oil and gas production. This is one of the most important climate-related races in Harris County. Of the four candidates, Chrysta Castañeda is the only candidate who explicitly mentions “climate change” in hercampaign statements. Castañeda, the Democratic candidate, proposes a regulatory focus on flaring, a common oil and gas extraction method, and methane emissions to limit greenhouse gas emissions in Harris County. Her opponents either have provided limited information on their policies to protect the climate or explicitly highlighted protecting the vitality of the oil and gas industry rather than our environment. Given Houston’s prominence in the oil-and-gas production sector, we recommend that voters prioritize this race on their ballots and choose a candidate who recognizes the potential this position has to address greenhouse gas emissions.\nAnother high-profile race this year is for United States senator. The incumbent is Republican John Cornyn, who has accepted moredonationsfrom oil and gas than any other sitting senator. Cornyn hasdeniedthe impact of climate change on rising temperatures, opposes a carbon tax, and received a dismal score of 6.25/100 from theClimate Political Action Committee. Democrat MJ Hegar is challenging Cornyn for the seat and haspledgedto avoid large donations from the fossil fuel industry. Hegar has outlined climate change as one of her top motivators for hercampaignand has received a perfect score of 100 from the Climate PAC.\nThe election for U.S. House Representative in District 2 also merits attention. The incumbent, Dan Crenshaw, has received ascoreof 0/100 from the Climate PAC and in 2020 he accepted the fourth largest amount ofmoneyof all U.S. House representatives from the oil and gas industry at about $279,326. Crenshaw has also disagreed with the scientific consensus on climate change, opposed the Climate Action Now Act and is against a carbon tax. Crenshaw’s opponent, Sima Ladjevardian, has received ascoreof 71.25/100 from the Climate PAC. Ladjevardian has shown an understanding of climate change and a willingness to tackle the issue. She supports flood recovery and resilience initiatives as well as efforts to accelerate the growth of a robust energy marketplace which includes renewable energy.\nAnother important position for environmental justice is the county attorney. The Harris County Attorney’s Office represents the county, its departments, elected and appointed officials and employees in all civil matters that involve business. This year the race is between Republican John Nation and Democrat Christian Menefee.Nationmakes no mention of environmental justice in his campaign. Menefee, however,acknowledgesthe impact and importance of environmental justice in an oil and gas city like Houston and aims to protect our community from environmental hazards.\nHouston has set a precedent by creating aclimate action plan. If the county and state are to follow through with plans of their own, we need climate champions in positions of power. Ignoring down-ballot candidates or electing candidates who are not environmentally progressive could easily delay comprehensive climate action for years and waste valuable time that our city does not have. The races above are just four of many important races. Other races to pay attention to are the state House and state Senate for District 13, chief justice, county judges and county school trustee elections.\nIf you’re voting in a different county or state, you can look upsample ballotsfor your county and use sources likeBallotpediato see candidates’ platforms and donations. You can check out their campaign website for a list of endorsements, which are often telling of policy priorities. Looking at Sierra Club ratings and Climate PAC rankings will indicate whether your candidate supports environmental policies. While this process can seem tedious, remember that investing 20 minutes of research is worth the impact of electing a candidate that cares about your community’s priorities. Don’t miss the opportunity to shape the future of your city, your county, your state and your country.\nTrisha Gupta, Gargi Samarth and Eunice Aissi are members of the Rice Climate Alliance.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
