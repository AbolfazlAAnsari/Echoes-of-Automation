            "inputText": "June 4, 2020\nWritten byDanni OlusanyaandUbyssey Editorial Board\nWhen I first walked intoThe Ubysseyoffice I was incredibly nervous. I had to ask three different people where the room was before I eventually finally found it. Even though I was only three minutes late to the meeting the office was already jam-packed with bodies. For the long duration of the meeting, I awkwardly stood in the doorway, peeking through the crevices between other students just to get a glimpse inside.\nI was starting to get used to these constant jitters. Yes, I was new to Vancouver and had never lived permanently away from home, but for the first time in my life, I was finding it difficult to make friends. I was never one to feel homesick or call my parents from a sleepover, but in the first weeks of school, I found it really difficult to picture this campus as my new home.\nWhen the meeting finished, I took a deep breath before walking inside and quietly waited in line to speak to an editor whose work I had admired for quite a while. When I approached her she handed me her business card before quickly cutting me off. I beat myself up about it on the way home thumbing the cheap card stock between my fingers and feeling doubly stupid. I got lost along the way.\nFour years later, I am finding myself sitting at her desk. It was not an easy road to get here. In the 102 years ofThe Ubyssey, I am the first Black woman to hold the position of editor, I am the second Black person to sit on the editorial period.\nI know that holds a lot of weight.\nI have spent the majority of my four years at this paper writing about Black people. This was never particularly intentional, it just happened. I once mentioned to a friend that I was scared of becoming a one-trick pony. Allowing myself to be that one girl complaining about racismâ€¦ again. But I was forced to do it. No one else would.\nIf you werenâ€™t aware of something. Iâ€™ll spell it out for you.\nBeing Black at UBC is hard.\nNot in America, not in BC or Vancouver, but here on our very own campus.\nIâ€™ve had the opportunity to talk to faculty, Iâ€™ve been in on lengthy late-night conversations with friends. Sometimes it can feel like we are constantly having to fight a losing battle. Not just to have our struggles recognized, but to be taken seriously as people.\nAll my Black friends at UBC essentially say the same things. They donâ€™t want to rock the boat when a white person screams the N-word at a party, they try not to overthink the fact that they couldnâ€™t find a group for a class project or the fact that they were stared at when the class discussion turned to the topic of slavery.\nBut I donâ€™t want to be the only person bringing these things up. I donâ€™t want to be a one-trick pony. Itâ€™s exhausting and frankly, itâ€™s not fair.\nThis year every editor of this paper is a minority in one way or another, but Iâ€™m sure they would all admit that they have their own biases and blind spots, even when they are aiming to be objective. I certainly know I do.\nI hope thatThe Ubysseytakes this moment to reflect on its own history which has often been complicit in its lack of coverage on the Black community at this institution. Because thereâ€™s only so much I can do.\nâ€“ Danni Olusanya, Culture editor\n______________________________________________________________\nFor 102 years,The Ubysseyhas been putting out content that matters to students. For the latest part of those 102 years,The Ubysseyhas platformed folks who arenâ€™t being heard â€“ often taking other campus groups or the university itself to task to do so. But for all those 102 years,The Ubysseyhasnâ€™t been great at looking in the mirror.\nCulture Editor Danni Olusanya is the first Black woman to ever be aUbysseyeditor and the second Black person to sit on our editorial, period. So while weâ€™ve been criticizing UBC fornot collecting dataon studentsâ€™ race, weâ€™ve been sitting pretty with a diversity predicament of our own.\nDespite electing staff representatives to hear out contributor grievances, despite a decentralized organizational structure, and despite a number of other internal policies and practices, weâ€™re still struggling to be an inclusive, welcoming space. To address this struggle, weâ€™re changing our tactics and making this policy change public, so itâ€™s here for future editorials to uphold.\nWeâ€™ve come up with a few goals that will help to keep inclusion and diversity inThe Ubysseyâ€™s mind for the current and future mastheads. They are:\nWeâ€™re not publishing this to glorify our allyship and win kudos â€“ weâ€™re writing this so that you can do toThe Ubysseywhat weâ€™ve done to the AMS and UBC for decades and keep us accountable. We want to prove the incredible diversity of this yearâ€™s editorial isnâ€™t a fluke, rather a point on a trend.\nFinally, we wanted to address the question that invariably comes up when any editorial pens an opinion: â€˜Isnâ€™t news media meant to be unbiased?â€™\nThis idea has been addressed afewtimesnow, but hereâ€™s our take: our journalism will always strive to tell the story fairly and accurately, but weâ€™ll never be soulless robots, disinterested in the rights and safety of folks fighting to live their lives. Anti-Black racism isnâ€™t subjective â€“ itâ€™s a fact that it exists.\nOne recent example of Canadaâ€™s unique brand of discrimination is that despite United States statistics showing that Black people aredisproportionately dyingfrom COVID-19,Canada still hasnâ€™t committed to collecting race-based data on the disease. To ignore anti-Black racism is an injustice and to believe that Canadaâ€™s past and present arenâ€™tplagued by racismis to be willfully ignorant.\nGeorge Floyd, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, Breonna Taylor, Pierre Coriolan and so many more â€“ these names mean something to us and we wonâ€™t pretend they donâ€™t. Black lives matter, and this isnâ€™t up for debate. Closer to home, UBC is no stranger to anti-Black racism and violence, shown by theracial profilingof Shelby McPhee at Congress 2019 orviolent arrestof former UBC football player Jamiel Moore-Williams for jaywalking.\nWe will always pursue coverage of stories like these but, with this public statement, weâ€™re renewing our efforts to look at our own newsroom with a critical lens. We refuse to do our staff, contributors and readers the disservice of not pursuing a betterUbysseyfor the present and future by ignoring our paperâ€™s problems. Weâ€™ve been making content for students since 1918, and we owe it to everyone â€“ within our office and out â€“ to foster inclusivity and platform voices that deserve to be heard.\nThere are a few Canada-specific places you can donate to in order to help support the Black community, includingHoganâ€™s Alley Society,Black Women Connect Vancouver, theBlack in BC community support fundandJustice for Regis.Hereis a list of Vancouver-based Black businesses you can support. For United States-based causes, a few options areReclaim the Blockand theBlack Visions Collective.\nShare this articlecopied!\nDanni Olusanyaauthor\nUbyssey Editorial Boardauthor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
