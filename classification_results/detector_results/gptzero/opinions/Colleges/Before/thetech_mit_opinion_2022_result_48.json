It may also change it for the worse:\nThe UE would introduce a third-party entity on campus:The UE is a national organization withits own political and financial interests, which may or may not align with graduate students’ interests. The UE can use member dues to advance these interests, including supporting its broader national organization, which issomething students opposed to the UE have raised concerns about. In addition to the UE’s national political agenda, the new local union leadership would likely have its own priorities that students may or may not agree with.\nThe UE would be able to pressure students and may continue to use students’ personal information, even after a victory:We’ve received reports during this campaign of students feeling pressured by union supporters. Unfortunately, behavior like this is likely to persist if the UE is successful. The union would need to seek new student members, garner student support for their bargaining and political positions, and likely persuade students to strike. And it would still be able to accesspersonal contact information that MIT was required to produce last month. (Students may contact ourInstitute Discrimination & Harassment Response OfficeorOffice of Student Conduct and Community Standardsif they have experienced any conduct that violates MIT policy).\nThe UE will impact student-advisor relationships:We know that theoverwhelming majority of graduate studentshave a positive view of the quality of academic advising and guidance as well as their interactions with faculty.Institute Professor Phillip Sharp and Professor Alan Grossman have authored anop-ed inThe Techabout the consequences a union would have on student-advisor relationships. Among their observations:“a unionized environment … reduces flexibility in favor of a highly structured relationship between manager and workers. We believe that such industry-framed relationships are ill-suited to the nature of and rapidly evolving opportunities in graduate education, where individuality and flexibility are necessary to foster a dynamic trajectory for graduate students.”\nEvery eligible student shouldcritically assess the different positions in this debate and voteon April 4 or 5in Morss Hall in Walker Memorial.This election’s outcome will be determined by a simple majority of those who vote but will be binding on everyone in theproposed bargaining unit— even for students who don’t vote or who don’t want a union."
