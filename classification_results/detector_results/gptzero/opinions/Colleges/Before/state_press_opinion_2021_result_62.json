Students report feeling overwhelmed by work in the midst of a pandemic.\n“I only got five hours of sleep last night!”\n“That’s nothing, I only got three.”\nWe’ve all had this conversation with one of our friends or classmates. College students feel the need to compete with theirpeers over who has gotten less sleep, who is eating a worse diet and who has the most homework. Working yourself down to the bone and focusing more on school and work than on your physical and mental health is becoming the norm.\nHustle cultureis the phenomenon of people, particularly young people, feeling they need to work as hard as they possiblycan. It may include staying up until sunrise to complete assignments, regularly using caffeine as a replacement for sleep, never taking days off or overloading your schedule to stand out from the crowd. Some young people evenreport feeling guiltywhen they do not work themselves as hard as they believe they should.\nMy secret is I sleep 8 hours every night because I'd rather feel healthy and be productive instead of working a few extra hours.I've felt shame about this for a long time because of hustle culture but I think it's actually what gives me my edge.\nIt’s no surprise so many young people are experiencing record-high levels of stress and anxiety. In 2019, Generation Z was reported to bethe most anxious generation,with 54% reporting feeling stressed at least once between the months of April and May, by the Wall Street Journal — and that was before the pandemic.\nWho can blame us? Since the beginning of our schooling, we are taught“grinding” is just good work ethic.Many students take severalAP or Honors classesso they can get into college, then they have to exert themselves nonstop in college to get a good job (not to mention having towork while in collegeto pay the tuition).\nIt's exhausting.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, many people went through some type oftraumatic experience. Not onlywere we expectedto keep working, but we were being told this was actually the perfect time to get things done. Write a book. Learn a new language. No days off!\nEven now, many of us may still be going through a difficult time. We are expected to brush ourselves off and get back to work. This is the message many universities across the country sent when they suddenly transitioned to virtual learning while expecting the same amount of productivity from their students and faculty.\nASU was no exception.Many studentsreported feeling overwhelmed with this change.\nTeri Pipe, founder of theCenter for Mindfulness, Compassion and Resilienceat ASU, says the University values innovation and wanting to make a positive impact on society. She said these are good values to have, unless they are taken to an extreme where individuals forget to focus on themselves. She noted the pandemic has exacerbated this trend of working ourselves into overdrive; however, hustle culture has been an issue even before COVID-19.\nThis brings up the question: Is all of this hard work healthy?\nThe termtoxic productivityrefers to an unhealthy obsession with productivity, a habit Pipe called \"dangerous to ourselves or to others\" while also feeling like one can never get enough done, leading to a vicious cycle of overworking oneself.\nThe only difference between hustle culture and toxic productivity is scale. Toxic productivity is an issue on a more personal level, while hustle culture is more of a wide-scale phenomena, with an emphasis on normalizing the latter.\nEven when it is time to relax, many students feel they are unable to rest. They feel a need to be doing something, and this can lead tofeelings of guiltwhen one decides they need to take a break. This cycle can consequentially invokeanxiety or insomnia.Severalstudents take melatonin to help with sleep, but it can get worse. Students can develop unhealthy habits such asdrinking, drug use or smoking.Some evenreport taking drugs like Adderallwhen they need to complete a large amount of work.\nGoing virtual has made this issue even more rampant. Since we are all online, we feel we need toconstantly be available.The line between work and leisure has become nonexistent, and people feel as if they cannot escape anymore because their workplace is now in the comfort of their home.\n\"There area lot of roles that (students) are playing, and now the lines between these roles have been blurred,\" Pipe said. \"I have students who areparents,but at the same time, they're trying to work or be a student.\"\nSo how do we escape from this cycle?Start by setting realistic goals for yourself. Talk to yourselfkindly.Hold yourself accountable when you begin overworking yourself.\n\"Be conscious of what is creating your stress,\" Pipe adds. \"And then examine your expectations and think about if they're realistic or not. Stress often comes from expectations that aren't being met. Talk to yourself like you would your best friend.\"\nSet boundaries for yourself to ensure you have enough time in your schedule to exercise, eat and sleep. Aim to get at leastseven hoursof sleep,eat adequate portionsevery day, don't answer emails related to school or work on the weekend and turn off your phonetwo hoursbefore bed.\nPipe ended by stating students who are struggling with their mental health are not alone.
