            "inputText": "On July 1, 2020, in light of the national reckoning sparked by the wrongful killings of Black Americans and the massive movement of brand activism, President L. Rafael Reif wrote aletter regarding efforts to address systemic racism at MIT. The main offering of this letter was the promise of a “comprehensive, Institute-wide Strategic Action Plan for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)” which would “establish clear, coordinated Institute-wide objectives.” Less than one year later, MIT senior leadership’s process of overseeing the strategic plan has failed its promise.\nIn September 2020, thestrategic action plan steering team, on which we serve as the undergraduate and graduate student representatives, was tasked with developing the plan. Concurrently, student activists across the Institute tried to leverage the perceived momentum for antiracist action, but senior and faculty leadership repeatedly told students that their concerns would be addressed by the strategic plan (and ignoredimmediate actions that could be taken to address systemic racism). With this hyperfocus on the strategic plan, much of our time on the committee was spent crafting the overarching strategic priorities and their corresponding commitments. Thedraft of the strategic planreleased in March 2021 indicates that it “attempt[s] to deliver an explicit, directional, and aspirational set of actions for MIT.” However, we witnessed firsthand how the initial drafts we worked on for seven months were, upon being vetted by senior administrators, purged of several meaningful actions. Many recommendations were changed in their underlying mechanisms from “there are existing inequities and here are recommendations to solve them” to “reviewing, evaluating, and assessingif inequities exist.”\nThese changes in language were even more jarring because of the lack of transparency in how and why they were made. Steering team leadership (John Dozier, Tim Jamison, and Maryanne Kirkbride) were the only members who communicated with MIT’s senior administration directly. Our concerns with the plan unraveling were met with deflections — senior and steering team leadership blaming the current structure ofdecentralization; senior leadership's preference for setting low-level goals so the plan is “fully achievable in five years”; and senior leadership’s fear of upsetting faculty and financial donors.\nIf we — student members of the steering committee who have spent countless hours every week in meetings and on phone calls to push for change — are not listened to, how can we trust that further feedback from the broader community via the engagement sessions will be incorporated? In fact, our queries about incorporating engagement session feedback were met with a non-committal response on making any major changes. When senior leadership privately recalibrates the plan while simultaneously, and publicly, calling for Institute standards, they endanger the trust that the MIT community places in them and, by extension, threaten the success of the strategic plan.\nIn understanding this threat, we must first define what it might look like to successfully address systemic racism in an academic institution’s strategic plan. We synthesize anti-racist scholarship [1] with our own experiences to define four dimensions.\nThe first dimension is toshift power dynamics to reduce the negative impact of hierarchy. Academia is built on hierarchical processes that are prone to the effects of racism, sexism, and other forms of bias. A strategic plan that shifts power dynamics would align these processes with Institute-wide standards for equity that better democratize decision-making. These standards must apply to any and all procedures where power imbalances or bias can sway an outcome (e.g., graduate admissions, qualifying exams, faculty hiring, and tenure).\nThe second dimension is toamplify and prioritize the needs of the most marginalized groups. Different communities will have unique sets of lived experiences and needs. Any plan to address oppression that does not actively center the voices and priorities of marginalized and underrepresented peoples may include positive ideas but will inevitably be incomplete.\nThe third dimension is toenact justice by holding individuals who perpetuate oppression accountable. Justice cannot exist without accountability. Accountability is about people taking responsibility for harmful behavior and taking action to repair that harm. The strategic plan must create strong accountability and support mechanisms at every administrative level (not just the Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response office) to condemn abusive, prejudiced, and/or racist behavior.\nThe fourth dimension is tocelebrate and incentivize anti-oppressive allyship and advocacy. We must better value the contributions and labor from faculty, staff, and students who advance DEI initiatives. This means incorporating DEI leadership as a factor in hiring, promotion, and fellowships; giving awards to staff and students; and compensating students who participate in Institute-level DEI initiatives.\nSenior leadership, whether intentionally or not, have taken actions that are antithetical to the four dimensions we think constitute a successful plan:\nComing off the cusp of grassroots community-wide advocacy and departmental organizing (e.g.,RISEanddepartmental student coalitions), senior leadership hasshifted power back to themselves, tilting the scales on our commitments to reinforce the de-centralized and hierarchical systems that pervade MIT. Students on the steering committee repeatedly asked for centralized standards and saw that language replaced with “work with department heads” and “convene a working group,” stalling any tangible actions.\nBy prioritizing the whispers of discontent from large conservative donors and faculty (and maybe even themselves), senior leadership has amplified the wants of the most privileged groups and activelydisregarded the needs of current community members who are hurting the most. This is best illustrated by senior leadership refusing to fund DEI officers for departments that need but cannot afford them and dodging community space requests from identity groups who feel that they do not have a home on campus. These are actions that are asked for by almost every minority group that this plan claims to serve.\nAnd by watering down the plan in closed-door meetings, they havedismantled mechanisms to hold them accountable for changeand insulated themselves (and us) from authentic dialogue about what it will take to improve MIT.\nThe commitments in the strategic plan that are strong have focused largely on the fourth dimension — to celebrate and incentivize allyship and advocacy —but this by itself only overburdens individuals, rather than iterating on systemic solutions. The students, staff, and faculty, generally women and people of color, who are already doing that work, do not just deserve awards; we deserve change.\nWe ask, where do senior leadership see themselves in this plan, other than taking credit for its creation? And will that plan materially improve the lives of those at MIT whom this plan was supposed to serve?\nAs students on the steering committee, we desired a plan with commitments that extend beyond its (and our) time at MIT. We have been honored to work alongside all those on the steering team, especially John Dozier, to draft this plan. But the onus for its impact on the MIT community lies squarely on the senior leadership, who have in one hand beckoned for sweeping change and in the other held up stop signs.\nWe have proposed changes to the strategic plan several times over on issues that directly impact students, which are detailedhere.We request that by May 7, the Academic Council respond to our proposed changes with clear answers of what they will commit to adopt from our changes and providewrittenrationales for any changes they do not want to accept, something that we have repeatedly asked for from senior leadership.\nMIT leadership has, in the name of “practicality” and “efficiency,” acted without transparency or accountability. If they fail to provide us with a clear response to our proposed changes, it will be another point of evidence that their definition of success for the strategic plan is predicated on its toothlessness, and is in direct conflict with ours. We have no interest in putting our names behind a plan that is mostly performative. We joined the committee to work towards a meaningful vision for a better MIT, and we will reassess our future participation if senior leadership continues to hinder that vision.\nIf you support this article, please email Provost Martin Schmidt (schmidt@mit.edu), ICEO John Dozier (jdozier@mit.edu), and ccsteercomm-students@mit.edu, saying “I support the student call for Institute-wide standards.”\n[1] Corneau, S., & Stergiopoulos, V.
