            "inputText": "\"The hate and violence that disrupted the electoral count could set an eerie precedent for protests on college campuses.\" Illustration published on Sunday, Jan. 17, 2021.\nThe shocking violence at our nation’s Capitol on Jan. 6 was the most heinous attack on our democracy since the Civil War ­— and it demonstrated just how serious an issue far-right terrorism is in the U.S.\nThe mob of President Donald Trump loyalists were more than insurrectionists, they werewhite supremacists, anti-Semites, homophobes and misogynists. Comparisons of their treatment to the treatment ofpeaceful Black Lives Matter protestersin June reveal a truly vicious double standard from police and the Pentagon.\nDespite the effects the chaos at the Capitol had on students — particularly students of color, LGBTQ+ students and Jewish students — ASU President Michael Crow has yet to condemn the attempted coup and those who took part in it.\nLike many other university leaders, Crow has sent manymessagesconcerning the return of ASU students for the spring semester.\nHowever, none of the messages have included even a short statement regarding the terrifying assault on our nation’s elected officials, unlike statements from manyother university leaders.\nCrow’s numerousCommunity of Careinitiatives encourage us to protect our community from COVID-19, but what about protecting our community of BIPOC, LGBTQ+ and Jewish students who would be targets of those hate groups that led the attack?\nPhoenix Hanes, a sophomore studying music learning and teaching, also felt apprehensive toward the events, expressing that “it made me really scared,” and acknowledged they “know a lot of (their) friends have received death threats just for being gay.”\nThe assault on our democracy had very real effects on ASU students, particularly on their mental health, and the lack of response from ASU leadership ignores these effects while implicitly condoning the hateful behavior at the Capitol.\n“I feel like not saying anything can say more than even approving of it,\" Hanes said. \"When Crow is staying silent while so many leaders, businesses, university presidents have come out and said it ... It leaves a lot of room for guessing … it makes me feel less comfortable.\"\nCrow must tell students hate and violence will not be tolerated and they will be safe and accepted for who they are while enrolled at ASU.\n“People who don’t condemn it are just people who don’t care about their fellow students, people of color, they only care about their appearance,\" Hanes said.\nHanes believes making a statement would be an important first step in ensuring a safe environment for ASU students and faculty.\n“It shows the people who support those terrorists that they are not welcome here,\" Hanes said.\nThe riots, spurned byunfounded allegations of election fraudby Trump and his allies, have not been limited to the Capitol. Protests were held here in Maricopa County near election day by some of thesame individualswho attempted to overthrow the government in the Capitol building.\nThe lack of a statement of condemnation conflicts with ASU’s statedsupport of minority communities.\n“I remember (Crow) talking about how he was in support of the (Black) community, however when he didn’t respond to the Capitol riots … he seems not to stand by that message,” said Jorja Overbey, a junior studying applied mathematics.\nThe numerous false claims about election fraud that have incited violencehave irreparably harmed the community, and \"the best way (Crow) can help is to spread information,” Overbey said.\nThe groups that instigated this violence, including the President and many Republican members of Congress who continue to voice conspiracy theories surrounding the election, are emboldened by the silence of those with the power to stop them. A statement from Crow would combat messages of violence and terror.\nWhen nothing is done to stop domestic terrorism, it implies acceptance of hateful individualsand ideologies.\n“What message does that send about ASU in general?” Overbey asked.\nAt ASU, we are measured by who we include, not by who we exclude. And our inclusion of a wonderfully diverse student body speaks volumes about who we can be.\nBut our inclusion of white supremacists, homophobes, anti-Semites and terrorists?\nIt speaks even louder.\nReach the columnist at tkgerald@asu.edu or follow @TKGeraldMusic on Twitter.\nEditor’s note: The opinions presented in this column are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
