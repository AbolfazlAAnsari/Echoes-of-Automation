The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors.\nThe social media app Fizz made its way to our campus earlier this semester, offering an anonymous discussion platform for exchanging messages and memes amongst Rice students. In recent weeks, antisemitic and racist posts were made by members of our community on this app. It is entirely hateful and dangerously intolerant.\nIn our capacities as Teaching Assistants for Critical Dialogues on Diversity, we have often heard genuine surprise at the mere mention of such bigotry or extremism existing amongst our student body. The phrase, “I can’t believe someone who was smart enough to get into Rice would say/do something like that” is all too common. As such, our work and experiences with CDOD, and as Diversity Facilitator Coordinators with the Office of Multicultural Affairs, compel us to share our thoughts on this matter.\nMake no mistake — these antisemitic posts were created by Rice students and likely posted under the shield of anonymity because these individuals are entirely aware of how completely antithetical these detestable posts are to the inclusivity we try so hard to foster and maintain here at Rice.\nThis is not who we are, and this is not what we stand for. We write this opinion piece, without the cover of anonymity and for all to see, because we firmly believe such hateful views have no place in our community.\nAlthough we hope that the moderators (who are also Rice students) become more proactive in immediately removing such hate speech and misinformation, we cannot passively wait and hope a select few will address the issue. Aside from any legislative actions or policy proposals the Student Association may create in the future, the onus needs to be on each and every one of us to reject this hateful content. If we are going to be a community that is proud of its Culture of Care, then it is precisely in a moment like this that we must embody that support, respect, and inclusivity for one another.\nAs Rice students, we must show, clearly and unequivocally, that we do not support such bigotry. The easiest way to do so is to stop using the Fizz app and to stop supporting a platform which promotes the rampant spread of such hate speech, targeted cyber-bullying and harassment. We cannot allow this app to detract from the Culture of Care we aim to cultivate here on campus, both in person and online.\nActions speak louder than words — and abandoning a platform with a design that lends itself to and encourages the proliferation of such hate speech is the single most effective step we can each commit to. You can get your Rice-related memes and jokes on GroupMe or Instagram — where there is at least some semblance of accountability inherent to what one posts.\nOur question for our fellow students is plain, simple and unambiguous: is using the Fizz app worth sacrificing our Culture of Care?\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
