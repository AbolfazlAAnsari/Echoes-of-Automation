Subcontracted workers are fearful for their job security, whether it’s custodial staff at UG-2 or Row staff in Student Organized Services, and they have received no assurances from the administration about the status of their work in light of the closure or scaling down of various campus services. Workers are in a situation where, if they’ve been exposed to COVID-19 or show symptoms of coronavirus, they have to dip into their existing sick days as Stanford has instituted no form of extra sick leave. Ongoing discussions with the union have produced no new action plans or results in a situation where timely solutions that put workers’ lives over profit are necessary.\nStanford’s stubbornness is especially disheartening in light of emergency measures being taken at other institutions.Starbucks has instituted14 days of catastrophe pay for anyone who’s been diagnosed with or exposed to COVID-19.At Walmart, employees who contract the virus or are subject to mandatory quarantines will receive up to 14 days of paid leave; in more serious cases, workers can get compensated for up to 26 weeks.And Harvard’s unions are demanding protectionsthat the University could do well to emulate: These include no lost pay for workers amid the closure of campus, additional paid sick leave and free coronavirus testing for unionized workers. This is why, again,Students for Workers’ Rights is calling on Stanford to immediately institute measuressuch as the introduction of additional paid sick leave; increased wages for service workers who are taking on additional risk; a commitment not to retaliate against workers who decide against working in unsafe conditions; and the institution of proper communication to workers regarding coronavirus updates.\nYet Stanford continues to do nothing for service workers. This inaction cannot be attributed to an administration hamstrung by the impact of coronavirus, considering how swiftly Stanford moved to make major decisions such as canceling Admit Weekend, moving courses online, asking students to leave campus and apply for housing in spring if they need to stay and instituting changes to its financial aid policies for those whom moving would pose a financial difficulty.\nRather, Stanford’s inaction is the result of a system which prioritizes growing its endowment over people. This administration hashired a cost-cutting corporation to conduct a time and motion studyfor improving the “efficiency” of already overworked custodial staff; its“Affordability Task Force” released nothing but band-aid solutions after 1.5 years of planning; and its“living wage policy”has remained essentially unchanged since 2007.As we saw with the withdrawal of its General Use Permit application earlier this fall, this is an administration which so balks at the idea of providing comprehensive affordable housing to workers that it decided to halt its own development. This is an administration with a several billion dollar endowment which acts as if it’s financially paralyzed when faced with choices that can save service workers’ lives.\nContact Ethan Chua at ezlc327@stanford.edu.\n\n"
