ASUCIsharedour bewildermentat the claim that student government leadership had been consulted in the university’s reopening decision.\nUCI claimed they consulted leaders. But did they really?\nThe lack of communication suggests that administrators’ words simply cannot be trusted.\nStern’s email is particularly frustrating because student government leadership had specifically asked UCI leadership at the advent of the omicron variant last quarter and again at the beginning of this quarter to consult with the student governments.\nFrom our perspective, UCI flagrantly ignored that request.\nASUCI and AGS believe that the university must publicly apologize for falsely claiming that student government leaders were consulted and for failing to consult student government leaders about a decision that directly impacts students.\nThere are manyquestions that the university has failed to answer as a direct result of their failure to consult with student government leaders.\nAmong the most pressing is how education at UCI will continue to be accessible for disabled and immunocompromised students. Some of these students are currently able to seek accommodation from the Disability Services Center (DSC). However, the DSC cannot help students who are not themselves disabled or immunocompromised but who live with and/or care for someone who is.\nOne student, for example, told AGS that they live with their 89-year-old diabetic grandmother. This student commutes to UCI, but current university policy gives this student no option to continue learning online in order to protect their vulnerable loved ones. The AGS Board has heard dozens of cases like this in the past week.\nAgain, there are manyconcerns the university must address to allow for a safe and accessible reopening. It is urgent that UCI immediately enact a policy of universal access, allowing anyone to self-determine if they need to continue learning or working online. No documentation needed, no questions asked.\nMany students may prefer a return to campus. However, obligating students to return — as is the case for many students under the current policy — is ableist. I am, frankly, shocked at the lack of planning and care that UCI’s current actions demonstrate toward disabled and immunocompromised people.\nThe university still has time to make this right. To do so, they must publicly apologize for their false statement and for failing to consult student government leaders. They must also immediately enact a policy of universal access.\nUntil then, the question remains: can students trust UC Irvine?\nCanton Winer is a sociology Ph.D candidate at the University of California, Irvine. He is also the Vice President of Financial Affairs for the Associated Graduate Student government. He can be contacted atcwiner@uci.edu.\n"
