We are exhausted. We don’t feel safe on campus or in our communities. We have waited far too long for action. We have waited as our Black community members have faced continued harassment, discrimination and interactions whose outcomes include bodily harm. We have waited as countless student leaders beseeched the administration for change with no response and, in some cases, no acknowledgement. We have waited as the Universitypivoted the Long-Range Vision to contribute to recoveryin response to the global pandemic, while virtually no action has been taken to address the “racism pandemic” present in our nation and on our campus. In this galvanizing moment, we feel the time for patience has passed. As an elite institution, we believe Stanford University has a duty and obligation to its Black community members to go beyond a statement. To address the backlog of student-led requests for racial equity on campus and truly embody the ideals outlined by the Presidential IDEAL initiative, we believe Stanford University must take immediate action.\nWe are in unwavering solidarity with and affirm the demands made by Stanford University Minority Medical Alliance (SUMMA), NOBCChE@Stanford, the coalition of Black student organizations gathered by the Stanford Black Law Students Association (BLSA) and the organizers and participants in the Rally for Racial Justice. To their uplifted voices, we, the Black student and postdoc members of the School of Medicine and our co-conspirators in liberation, add our own call for immediate action.\nWe ask for a financial commitment from Stanford University of at least $25 million to be distributed according to the following demands, which were drafted and edited by SOM community members and approved by all signed organizations:\nWithin 6 months (by Dec 2020)\nWithin 12 months (by June 2021)\nWithin 18 months (by Dec 2021)\nWe write this letter with full knowledge that future generations of Stanford students, postdocs, staff, faculty, alumni and the wider public will look back on this time and ask, “How did Stanford respond to the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020?” We believe that a just future is obtainable only through our collective action. We believe your leadership, President Tessier-Lavigne and Provost Drell, to be within the arc of a moral universe bending our institution towards justice and that you are willing to act on that belief in this revolutionary moment. Together, we can move towards making Stanford University a space in which Black students, postdocs, staff and faculty feel truly safe, supported and included.\nWe look forward to your response and committed action to affirm that on Stanford University’s campus, Black Lives more than Matter.\nIn Righteous and Resounding Solidarity,\nStanford Black Postdoc Association (SBPA)National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers at Stanford (NOBCChE@Stanford)Stanford National Medical Association (SNMA)Stanford University Minority Medical Alliance (SUMMA)Stanford Black Graduate Students Association (BGSA)Stanford Black Pre-Med OrganizationStanford Black Bioscience Organization (SBBO)Biomedical Association for the Interest of Minority Students (BioAIMS)The Blackprint: Building Black Business Leaders and EntrepreneursSociety of Black Scientist and Engineers (SBSE)Stanford First-Generation and/or Low-Income PartnershipStanford African Students AssociationStanford Black Student UnionStanford Black Pre-Law Society (BPLS)Stanford University Postdoctoral Association (SURPAS) Leadership & CouncilStanford Latinx Postdoc Association (SLPA)oSTEM and the LBGTQ+ postdocsStanford Native American Graduate Students (SNAGS)Stanford Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS)Stanford Hermanas in STEMThe American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES)Black Law Students Association (BLSA)Black Engineering Graduate Student Association (BEGSA)Stanford Black Business Student Association (BBSA)Black in Computer Science at Stanford\nContact the editors of opinions at opinions ‘at’ stanforddaily.com\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.
