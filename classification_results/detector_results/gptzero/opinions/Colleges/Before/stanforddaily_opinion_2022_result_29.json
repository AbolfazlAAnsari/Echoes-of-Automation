            "inputText": "In response to community outrage andnewscoverageof thereported assaultover the weekend, Stanford sent out another email entitled “Campus security.” Its contents were insufficient and left me with more questions than before. If Stanford truly cares about the safety of our community, the university owes us answers, now.\nFirst, note that Stanford doesn’t promise to execute the basic security measures the email mentions (“outdoor lighting, keycard access to buildings, security staffing, our blue emergency tower system”). Instead, they pledge to do “additional work to assess where other enhancements in [their] infrastructure or security protocols would be useful.”\nWhat does “additional work” actually mean? Treat our concerns seriously, Stanford. Tell us the concrete steps you are taking. Pledge measurable changes with delivery dates.\nWe are told that “a cross-functional group of university leaders takes the lead on this work.” Are survivors, activists and sexual violence experts included in this “cross-functional group”? What “functions” comprise this group? Again, what measurable work? Creating a committee is not action.\nOn “outdoor lighting”: why is it that I bike home through patches of near-total darkness? I can’t even see my bike lock when I’m parking at night. Why is it that Scary Path, an unlit route on campusnotorious among female students, was only replaced aftertwo yearsof constant student advocacy andexternalmediacoverage?\nOn “keycard access to buildings”: why do I not need my student ID to enter any of my classrooms or buildings this quarter, apart from my dorm?\nOn “blue emergency towers”: why can I recall seeing blue towers in at least two locations wrapped haphazardly with yellow tape?\nGenerations of activists at Stanford have already identified where the university “canmakeusefulimprovements.” We don’t just want “safety features” to be “continually reviewed.” We want visible change right now.\nSecond, Stanford has “temporarily expand[ed] the presence of security staff on the Stanford campus.” This is one change I have actually witnessed over the past two days; however, I’m not convinced that it’s a positive one. The email itself alludes to the “concern” and “anxiety” this change may cause some students, due to the harmful ways in whichsecurity staffingandsurveillance camerashave disproportionately harmed people of color.\nBesides these concerns, I mostly welcome the physical security measures that Stanford plans to implement if the university will legitimately deliver. These measures will undoubtedly help some studentsfeelsafer on campus.\nBut Stanford’s claim that this security is “intended to help deter any criminal activity” completely mischaracterizes the nature of sexual violence on our campus. The entire email’s sole focus on physical security measures misses the point.\nHere are thefacts:\nEighty-one percent of rapes perpetrated against Stanford undergraduate women took place in auniversity dorm, fraternity house, sorority house or other residential housing.\nEighty-six percent of all Stanford men and 85% of all Stanford women reported that the nonconsensual sexual contact they experienced at Stanford wasperpetrated by a Stanford student, alumni or other person associated with Stanford.\nEighty-one percent of Stanford men and womenknew or recognized the personwho had non-consensually sexually contacted them.\nThese numbers are not explicable by deficiencies in physical security. Therefore, they cannot be addressed by increasing physical security measures. Since the majority of these crimes happen indoors, out of patrolling police officers’ sight, a stronger police presence can’t meaningfully deter sexual violence.\nThe numbers also cannot be primarily explained by Stanford students being sexist, entitled, racist or a variety of other socioeconomic factors that contribute to sexual violence — for reference, we can compare theoverall rate of nonconsensual sexual contactat peer institutions: 49.2% at Harvard and 44.1% at MIT, compared to Stanford’s 60.8%.\nTo be blunt, sexual abusers at Stanford have reason to think they cangetawaywithit. To get to the root of this issue, Stanford must:\nTo all the students, workers, faculty, parents and alumni of Stanford:\nPlease do not forget your shock. Please do not forget your anger that this is allowed to happen on our campus. Please do not forget all the survivors on our campus who suffer every day from Stanford’s negligence. Please do not forget the fear that we feel.\nThis is not the first time we have been betrayed by Stanford’s inaction. It will not be the last — unless we refuse to move on.\nUnfortunately, data for transgender/genderqueer/gender nonconforming students was not included in the referenced sections of the AAU report.\nJoyce Chen ‘25 is the chair of the Editorial Board for Vol. 263.
