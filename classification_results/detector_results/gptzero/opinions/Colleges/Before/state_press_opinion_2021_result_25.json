            "inputText": "\"The lifting of restrictions in Arizona could cause another wave of COVID-19 infections throughout the state.\" Illustration published on Monday, Nov. 9, 2020.\nOn March 25, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey lifted all remainingCOVID-19 restrictions. This transition came way too early, as Arizona does not yet have herd immunity due to the fact that people are still getting vaccinated.\nExperts are warning we could see anotherwave of infectionsif we lift restrictions too soon. Then again, Arizonabarelyenforced restrictions in the first place.\nWenever had a statewide mask mandate, and according tothe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Arizona ranks sixth in the country for COVID-19 cases per 100,000 since January 2020. Sincemasks preventthe spread of COVID-19, it's possible that not having a statewidemask mandatecould be a contributing factor to Arizona's high number of cases and deaths.\nASU researchers have detected a newCOVID-19 \"variant of interest,\"but Ducey has moved forward with aprohibition against local and statewide mask mandates, meaning Arizona cities can no longer implement mask mandates.\nThe lack of a state- or city-wide mask mandate gives anti-maskers justification for their decision to not wear a mask, which puts others at risk. Even though businesses can still decide if they want to implement mask mandates, these types of mandates are not enough.\n“I’m a bit worried that they’re lifting this mandate too early, given the number of people that have been vaccinated,” said PJ Saturno, an ASU alumnus and Arizona resident. “I feel that it gives people a false sense of security.”\nDespite Ducey's initiative to lift any remaining COVID-19 restrictions in Arizona, ASUis still enforcingnecessary protocols, such as testing for the virus, wearing masks and social distancing. ASU decided not to lift any COVID-19 protocols and continues to require masks in campus buildings and outdoor gathering spaces, limit building capacity and offer select classes with virtual learning options.\nIt is currently unknown what protocols ASU will keep for the Fall 2021 semester, and we are expecting afull returnto in-person classes.\n“I think ASU has done many things right ... but there are probably more things that they could have done,” Saturno said.\nBut outside ASU, local bars such asVarsity Tavern,Whiskey Rowandmany othershave eliminated COVID-19 protocols in lieu of Ducey's order. It is irresponsible for these establishments to act like the pandemic is over when it's an ongoing threat.\nAnother video from Varsity Tavern on Mill Avenue in Tempe shows clearly how packed the venue was on Thursday night.pic.twitter.com/LvyQH60VTg\nAlthough ASU still has restrictions, the fact the rest of the state is beginning to lift restrictions too early, possibly fueling anotheroutbreak, could affect students and faculty. ASU is not a bubble, and many of our community members go to these businesses and events that do not require masks, possibly bringing the virus back to campus.\nWhile vaccines are now more accessible than ever, why not wait to reopen the state fully until the majority of the population is vaccinated?\nLuckily, increases in vaccine distribution will hopefully end Arizona's vicious cycle of lifting restrictions and causing COVID-19 cases to climb.However, it is still going to take a while to geteveryone vaccinated,so lifting all restrictions now makes no sense.\nOPINION:The COVID-19 vaccine should be an on-campus requirement\nOn a state and federal level, we have previously seen the dangers of lifting COVID-19 restrictions too soon. Arizona made this same mistake back in May, by lifting the stay-at-home order while we were stillfacing an outbreak. To date,almost 17,000Arizonans have died from COVID-19.\nUnlike other states and countries, Arizona did not put a second lockdown into place. Officials continued to enable this outbreak in the name of “freedom,” while sweeping thousands of deaths under the rug. It was a slap in the face to our hospitals, which almost reached full capacity.\nArizona has been enabling anti-maskers and unsafe behaviors throughout this entire pandemic, which has left a permanent stain on its reputation.\nReach the columnist athtenore@asu.eduor follow@haleyyhmton Twitter.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
