            "inputText": "On February 16,MIT Divestfiled a legal complaint with the Office of the Massachusetts Attorney General to investigate the MIT Corporation’s continued financial investment in the fossil fuel sector. Frustrated with universities’ insufficient action in the face of the climate crisis,our student divestment campaign and similar groupsfrom Princeton, Yale, Stanford, and Vanderbilt each prepared a legal complaint with the assistance of attorneys from theClimate Defense Project. Signatures from prominent professors, community members, climate scientists, elected officials, student organizations, alumni, and national environmental organizations supporting the cause show that there is widespread agreement that investments in fossil fuels are not just immoral and financially irresponsible — they are also illegal.\nThe complaint is a request to Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to investigate the MIT Corporation’s conduct regarding its management of MIT’s$27.4 billionendowment and use the Attorney General’s enforcement powers to order the Corporation to cease its investments in fossil fuels. Under the MassachusettsUniform Prudential Management of Institutional Funds Act, the MIT Corporation has a fiduciary duty to invest with consideration for the university’s “charitable purposes” — a duty that distinguishes nonprofit institutions from other investors. By investing a portion of MIT’s endowment in the fossil fuel industry, the Corporation is violating that duty and failing to “act in good faith and with loyalty.” Putting our university’s endowment into an industry actively contributing to the rapidly evolving climate catastrophe, while continuing to lie and spread misinformation about the role of fossil fuels in creating this crisis, isnotinvesting with prudence as the law requires.\nMIT Divest’s complaint is another reminder that MIT does not function within a vacuum. The MIT administration has shied away from taking clear stances against fossil fuel companies due to the“risk” of “becoming perceived as just another partisan voice.”But this so-called “risk” is no risk — it is the unfortunaterealityfor anyone who acknowledges the scientific consensus and stands for the truth about climate change. Fossil fuel companies areintensely politicalandpartisanin their promotion of their own agendas and obstruction of climate action — just ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, and the American Petroleum Institute alonespent over $400 million from 2011 to 2021 lobbying the U.S. government. Furthermore, the industry has conducted climate misinformation campaigns for nearly half a century, despite possessing evidence linking fossil fuel burning to climate changedecades before the general public. By remaining invested in fossil fuel stocks on the false grounds of political neutrality, MIT not only willfully blinds itself to the political ramifications of its investments but also funds the efforts of the fossil fuel industry to twist truth and science into political theater.\nRefusal to divest is also a deliberate, direct stance upholding the status quo — and the climate status quo is grossly unjust. Climate change exacerbates inequity at every scale. Affordable housing units within low-lying regions here in Massachusetts areespecially vulnerableto flooding from rising sea levels and intensified weather events. Within the U.S., if fossil fuel usage continues to rise, the counties in the bottom five percent of incomeare projected to sufferclimate-associated economic damages of 5.5% to 27.6% of total county income while those in the top five percent are expected to face much smaller income losses of up to 4.2% or even small gains of up to 1.1%. Globally, climate change hasalready created an additional 25% GDP disparitybetween the wealthiest and poorest countries and ispredicted to continue worseningglobal economic inequity.\nPrecedent for taking clear, unequivocal stances against injustice — even when those stances can be construed as political — can be found in MIT’s own history. In 2007, MIT declared that it“will not invest in a company whose actions or expressed attitudes are abhorrent to MIT”in response to calls from student activists to divest its endowment from funds linked to acts of genocide against the Darfuri people in western Sudan. More recently, the MIT administration has consistently demonstrated its support for Professor Gang Chen, an MIT faculty member targeted by the U.S. Department of Justice under the China Initiative, a project widely criticized by civil rights activists asdiscriminatory against individuals of Chinese heritage. We at MIT Divest applaud the MIT administration for standing against immoral and unjust actions in both of these instances.\nWe demand that MIT once again recognizes the political ramifications of all of the institution’s actions. We demand that MIT consciously chooses to uphold the principles of truth and justice. And we demand that MIT takes actionnow.\nAs theeffects of climate changecontinue to debilitate our planet and its people, the need to act becomes more dire by the second. We may not be able to reverse the damage that has been done, butwecanprevent further catastrophe for ourselves and our descendants. It will take drastic changes, however, and include technological advances to be developed here at MIT. Yet, even as our institutionstrives to foster this innovation, our leadership continues to contribute to the problem by maintaining their investments in fossil fuels. Until the industry loses the support of respected institutions, they will continue decimating our climate for profit.\nWe know that MIT has the power to put its money where its mouth is and remove our investments from fossil fuels. In doing so, we will join a growing coalition of organizations who are not afraid to challenge the status quo and save our planet. Furthermore, due to MIT’s status as a leading academic institution, divesting at MIT will catalyze further climate action around the world.\nThis series of legal complaints illustrates the growing legal opposition to fossil fuel investment. Themajority of students and facultyon our campus, as well asmany prominent figuresin our area, support divestment. If it takes legal action for MIT to listen to its community, uphold the truth, and stand against global injustice, what does that say about what this institution really stands for? In order for MIT to truly live up to its mission statement and continue to be a leader in changing the world for the better, there is only one option:divestment now.\nAaliya Hussain’25 is a first-year student.\nNathan Shwatal ’24 is a second-year student in EECS and BCS.\nMitali Chowdhury ’24 is a second-year student in BE and DUSP."
