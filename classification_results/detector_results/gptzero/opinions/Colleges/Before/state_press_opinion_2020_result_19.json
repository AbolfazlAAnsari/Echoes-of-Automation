            "inputText": "\"Dear State Press, you've got mail.\" Illustration published on Friday, March 3, 2017.\nWhile it may not be apparent to most ASU students, our University has a deep relationship with China — a totalitarian regime with no regard for human rights, only seeking to expand its influence and ideology abroad.\nCurrently, ASU runs three degree programs in Shanghai, with thestated goalof “cultivat(ing) world-class executives for China’s state-owned enterprises.\" Additionally, ASUconducts research with many Chinese universitiesand hosts multiple study abroad programs in the country. ASU’s goals in China are well-intentioned: building connections and avoiding conflicts together,according to President Michael Crow.\nHowever, ASU is instead emboldening the Chinese regime — ignoring its increasingly awful human rights record and global ambitions.\nFor example, ASU has an Executive Master of Business Administration programspecifically developedfor China Unicom, a state-owned telecommunications operator, which was responsible for a2015 cyberattackon Github.Githubis an American platform where information that would otherwise be censored in China can be stored and accessed by those avoiding the country's censors.\nASU even describes the university they partner with to deliver their degree program as“under the governance of China’s Ministry of Finance.”\nThis is a regime that is currently putting millions of Uighurs  — a predominantly-Muslim ethnic group native to China’s Xinjiang Province — inconcentration camps reminiscent of Nazi Germany. The Communist Party also sanctions the outright ethnic cleansing of Uighurs, forcing Uyghur women toundergo forced sterilizations and abortions on a large scale.\nThis month, China ended Hong Kong’s sovereignty, imposing the so-called “National Security Law” effectively ending freedom of assembly and speech in the previously autonomous territory.Signs promoting independence are now illegalandHong Kong schools are destroying books critical of Communist China.\nIn 2019, Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, wasforced to apologizeafter tweeting support for protesters in Hong Kong. Recently, the NBAprohibited customers from writing “Free Hong Kong” on jerseys. How long until ASU student-athletes —who do play in China— are no longer allowed to speak their mind for fear of angering the Chinese regime?\nLast year, ASUclosed the Confucius Institute on campusafter the Department of Defense threatened to withhold certain funding from the University. Confucius Institutes are widely considered to beunder the direct control of the Chinese Communist Party, with the express purpose ofundermining academic freedom and surveilling Chinese students abroad.\nASU should always welcome Chinese students — many seeking America’s freedom — to our Valley campuses, with the hope that many of them will eventually become American citizens who contribute to our country.\nHowever, ASU cannot continue to pretend that the Chinese Communist Party is acting in good faith. China’s ambitions span further than increased trade with the United States; China seeks to become the dominant global power — economically, militarily, and politically.\nIn years past, there was hope that China would democratize with increased engagement. However, the reality is that the Chinese regime has no interest in democracy or human rights.\nASU must recognize that it is playing a role in enabling this brutal regime and reconsider its presence in China.\nEditor’s Note: The opinions presented in this letter to the editor are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement fromThe State Press or its editors.
