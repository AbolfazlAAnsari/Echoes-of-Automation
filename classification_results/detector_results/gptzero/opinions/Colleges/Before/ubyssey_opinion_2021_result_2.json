There are a million ways to volunteer and contribute on and off campus.\nI do have to say, though, that students are incredibly busy. Trust me, I get it! You’re constantly running around for school and work. But, if you find yourself having some extra free time this summer, spend some of it giving back. It’s a nice break from the usual hustle and bustle of university life.\nSometimes, I find that volunteering can be draining. So, I volunteer for a few months, then take a break. When I feel better and ready to give back again, I start volunteering. It’s important to recognize your limits (again, I really need to listen to my own advice at times)! It’s nice to help others but you need to be taking care of yourself first.\nVolunteering can be a way to explore interests you don’t otherwise get the opportunity to. It can open doors to potential employment opportunities and can bring you an immense amount of joy.\nSome ways to give back include:\nWhat are some ways you give back?\nThis article was originally published in November 2021.It has been updated to reflect its publishing in the June 2022 print issue.\nThe authors of this column are not mental health professionals.
