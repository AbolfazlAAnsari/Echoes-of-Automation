            "inputText": "An earlier version of this letter appeared in the Sept. 19, 2018 Stanford Daily.\nAs the three deans responsible for overseeing the education of the largest number of Stanford’s students, including all of its undergraduates, we write again, in a presidential election year, to urge you, regardless of your political affiliation, to register and to exercise your right to vote.\nOur right to vote is hard won. It took centuries of struggle to establish this right — for property-less men, for African American men, for women and, in 1971, for all U.S. citizens over the age of 18. The right to vote is fundamental to protecting, asserting and expanding our other rights. Almost all of the social and economic rights Americans enjoy today — including Medicare and Medicaid, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, the Occupational Health and Safety Act and the Clean Air Act — exist because citizens elected public officials who voted to enact them.\nBut low numbers of American citizens exercise their right to vote and, unfortunately, voters in the 18-29 age range are less likely to vote than any other qualified age group. Stanford students, faculty and staff have been working hard to increase voter turnout, which was very low in some earlier election cycles. According to the National Study of Learning, Voting and Engagement (NSLVE), only 48.1% of eligible Stanford undergraduates, graduates and post-doctoral fellows voted in the 2016 presidential election. NSLVE calculated that less than 20% voted in the 2014 mid-term elections. Because of the hard work of many people at Stanford, voter registration among students had a jump up in 2018. But we can do even better. If you have not yet registered to vote, please do so as soon as possible because state deadlines are approaching. Just go to:https://www.stanfordvotes.org/.\nHere, we offer five main reasons for voting:\nThis fall, the School of Humanities and Sciences is also sponsoring a series of panels bringing faculty expertise to bear on some of the issues that U.S. democracy confronts today. You can view and register for the serieshere(you are free to join any of the sessions). At the first session approximately 1000 Stanford students, faculty and staff tuned in.\nOf course, you can certainly do more — along with others, including those U.S. immigrants who are not eligible to vote — to help to make our society and our world better. We do not mean to suggest that the only way for you to be involved in questions of public concern is by means of a vote. But it is a way, and perhaps the most important way.\nSo, vote for the party and candidate of your choice, but by all means vote.\nDebra Satz, Dean, School of Humanities and SciencesJennifer Widom, Dean, School of EngineeringStephan Graham, Dean, School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.
