In Trump’s first 36 months, the Dow Jones soared to anall-time high, and the unemployment rate plummeted to ahalf-century low. Deserved or not, he took the bulk of the credit in the eyes of the American public. By mid-February, with strong market conditions at his back and an implodingDemocratic Partyat his feet, a Trump victory in 2020 looked like a safe bet.\nBut that was then. If nothing else, the last month has shown us how fast the world can change. Biden’s resurgence and the coronavirus outbreak have flipped this election’s political calculus on its head. Now faced with ahigh-polling challengerand awildly mishandled pandemic, it is unclear whether all the liberal-bashing in the world will be enough to retain swing voters. So Trump is taking a different tack, leaning into his relatively popular economic record and pushing for the resumption of everyday life in the midst of COVID-19. If you squint a little, it makes a certain amount of sense. Mandatory shutdowns are to consumer spending the way hurricanes are to Houston, and it is obvious that the longer we stay inside, the worse the inevitable recession will be.\nYet returning to business as usual would come at an astronomical human cost. The president repeatedly and persistently floatedEaster Sunday— April 12 — as a target date for easing quarantine measures. Though he ultimatelyextendedfederal distancing guidelines through the end of the month, his mind seemsfar from made up, even as public health officials warn we mustramp up our efforts exponentiallybetween now and then, not dial them back. We need drastic action, moral courage, deference to experts, leadership on an individual level. But Trump has preferred tomisinform,obstruct,flout the scientistsandprioritize corporations over citizens. In the crucible of national crisis, he has demonstrated nothing save a failure to live up to the moment and a willingness to sacrifice Americans on the altar of unfettered capitalism.\nStill, the current financial turmoil shouldn’t change the calculus here. When it comes to COVID-19,epidemiologistsandeconomistsare saying the same thing: The harm this pandemic could cause to our health and wealth will be far more catastrophic if we reopen the country too early. Urging workers back to the office and shoppers back to the stores will do nothing but overload the hospitals, tank the markets andpile up the body bags, none of which bodes well for Trump’s presidency come November.\nIt’s not surprising to see the president choose knee-jerk reactionism over his own long-term interests. His response to coronavirus is just one moreshort-sighted decisionin an administration whose defining quality is an inability to think beyond the next news cycle. But in this most unprecedented of circumstances, maybe Trump shouldn’t base policy on James Carville’s economic platitudes. More useful might be the tried-and-true rationale of a retiree on a cruise ship: You can’t spend money when you’re dead.\nContact Sean Casey at spcasey ‘at’ stanford.edu.\n\n"
