We appreciate the platform the Thresher has given stories like “Black at Rice” and “In Their Own Words” this year — and recognize their meaningful contribution to the campus dialogue. However, speaking from our individual experiences in the Student Association Senate, we think it is important to note that the Thresher presents information in an environment in which there are few external checks on the narratives that it creates. This can present problems for students with perspectives that counter the Thresher’s but lack the same institutional capacity to present conflicting accounts. We find ourselves in that position today due to some of the ways in which the SA has been covered this year.\nThis year's SA Senate has beenpresented asnot caring about our \"constitution or [our] elections, that famously democratic process,\" as “lacking student engagement” and as ineffective in comparison to the SA Senate that “created theCritical Thinking in Sexualityworkshop requirement.\" Each of these claims is contestable: we have a committee dedicated to overseeing our election process and a Parliamentarian who ensures the constitution is followed; we have tasked anauditing committeewith analyzing and improving our organization's structure and this year; and we processed thousands of responses to the Survey of all Students as they pertain toour formal objectives. The critique of the SA we want to address more fully is the final one stating that the present SA does not live up to past precedent.\nSince the CTIS requirement was recommended by the SA in 2015, the SA has continued working by lobbying forSaturday dinners, securingNew York Times subscriptions for campus,designing and implementing acomposting initiative, setting standards forstudent leadership eligibility, establishing campus values onacademic freedom, calling forbetter international student financial aidand pushing for sources of support forrefugeeandDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals students, among other efforts. All of these were covered by the Thresher.\nThis year SA members have worked toincrease menstrual product accessibility, defined aplan for greater African presence in academia, crafted a jointSA-Graduate Student Association resolution on diversity and inclusion resources, stood in solidarity withLatinx and immigrant communityandrefugeemembers, created theguest meal swipe sharing program, started aninterpersonal violence policy committee, worked to reclaim theCulture of Careand advocated on behalf of students on topics such asfinancial accessibility,academic freedom and protest rightsand sexually transmitted infectiontesting costs. While some of these projects have received coverage from the Thresher, many others have not, reinforcing the narrative that the SA has not been as effective this year as it has in years past.\nWhen you erase these from our collective memory by excluding them from media coverage, two things occur: you devalue hundreds of students’ work that, while produced under the umbrella of the “SA,” does in fact belong to individuals and you perpetuate the narrative that the SA isn’t productive and therefore isn’t worth joining. The second of these points is a problem for us especially during election seasons when, after hearing of the SA’s ineptitude, students may be more likely to focus their energies on other organizations where they feel their work will be more recognized and valued.\nMaking students feel underappreciated and voiceless is the last thing that we want. We want our members, which include every undergraduate, to take pride in the SA’s work and know that they have a space to speak in this organization. For this reason, we have sent monthly email updates to the undergraduate body highlighting student initiatives,hosted an SA external objectives week,organized town hallswhere anyone can come to share their perspectives and presented regularly at college government meetings. However, we recognize that many of these channels do not reach every student.\nThe Thresher'smissionis \"to provide the student body with up-to-date campus news and information.\" However, when we've been reported on, we find that the predominant message is that the SA is either an organization ofone presidentor of 26voting members— even though the SA hasover 100 formal leadersand many partners around campuswho often are ignored. As much as we try to bring students' efforts to light, we aren't an organization meant for mass storytelling – that's you.\nThe SA wants and needs to collaborate with the Thresher. And in the past, it has; for example, in the case of maternal and caregiver leave policy inequities, the Thresher reported on non-tenure-trackcaregiver leave concernsand theSA activated to address them. We recognize and respect the Thresher staff’s dedication to the Thresher’s mission, and are now asking you to please do the same for us. Because together, we can work to combat critical issues on campus while also celebrating student work in these areas, creating a compassionate environment in which we can use our institutional power in a positive way. We believe that we have a responsibility to do this; our only question now is, do you?\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
