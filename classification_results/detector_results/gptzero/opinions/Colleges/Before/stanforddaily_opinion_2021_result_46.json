            "inputText": "The mission of The Daily is to serve and accurately report on the broader Stanford community. And to do so, we’re asking for input from you — our readership and the broader Stanford community — about how we can do better.\nThis summer, we’ll be reaching out to members of the community to have one-on-one conversations about how we can better report on Stanford. Through these listening sessions, we hope to learn more about what people care about and need more information on, as well as to understand the ways in which we have failed to deliver on our mission in the past.\nThese conversations will take place over roughly the next 100 days and we hope to speak to at least 100 people (hence the name). At the end, we’ll compile the insights from these conversations into a report that’ll guide our newsroom. While we can’t promise to make changes or endorse ideas that may arise from these conversations, we can guarantee that we’ll listen, reflect and give each voice weight.\nOur staff will be reaching out in the coming days to people in the community. But whether or not you hear from us directly, we do want to hear from you — students, staff, faculty, alumni, administrators and more. If you would like to be contacted for a conversation, please fill outthis form.\nIn addition to these conversations, we’ll also distribute a survey, asking The Daily’s readership similar questions. We hope you’ll take the time to help us be the best we can be for you. If you’d like to contribute to this survey data, please fill outthis form. (After completing the survey, you will be directed to a form for entry to win one of several $50 gift cards!)\nBefore we wrap up this letter, we’d like to thankThe Oaklandsideand theListening Post Collectivefor inspiring this initiative and creating documents that have helped guide our planning.\nThrough this process, we hope to continue to improve toward our goal of serving the Stanford community with relevant, accurate and ethical journalism.\n— The Vol. 260 Executive Team\nKate Selig served as the Vol. 260 editor in chief.
