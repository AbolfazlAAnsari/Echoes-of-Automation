Now, as we slowly emerge from the shadows of the pandemic, we should acknowledge the significance and necessity of international cooperation and commit ourselves to achieving it.\r\nThere are times in history when we find ourselves at the mercy of forces beyond any individual’s control, and some examples strike surprisingly close to the present pandemic: global rivalries spiraling out of control (World War I), an initially unknownviral pathogendecimating entire populations (Christopher Columbus’ conquest), and governmentssliding into protectionismas existing market supply and demand are interrupted (the Great Depression). This predicament of passivity is especially real in the midst of a pandemic, when the existing world order is upended by a nonliving particle. InAnthony Fauci’s words, “You don't make the timeline, the virus makes the timeline.”\r\nBut even if the virus makes the timeline, human agency is not completely denied. We are, in one way or another, choosing how to react in the face of forces beyond human control. We will be responsible for the consequences of our choices, and this means we must choose actively and responsibly.\r\nWe must truthfully and faithfully record what has happened already, which entails remembering thesourceof thevirus(withoutsubscribing togroundlessand shamefulconspiracytheories) as well as China’sinitial coverup. But the story does not end there; instead of merely accusing China of rewriting the narrative of the pandemic, other countries should seek to co-write it. For the Western world to assume that the narrative is complete and definitive, with China as the culprit and the world order as its victim, would be to concede one’s agency and ability to change the course of the pandemic and, by extension, its legacies.\r\nNow, more than ever, we must assert the virtues of globalism. From its rapid spread to the rapid worldwide shutdowns in response, the coronavirus has demonstrated how interconnected the world is. A global health crisis requires global solutions. President Barack Obama demonstrated this foresight in his handling of theEbola crisisincollaboration with China, with the European Union simultaneouslycontributingas well. And during the SARS outbreak in 2003, theWorld Health Organizationused its power, credibility, and authority appropriately to coordinate a successful response.\r\nWe need global unity and leadership to coordinate a worldwide response to the coronavirus as well. But based on the WHO’s willingness toparrot the Chinese governmentand the near-comic American “modern piracy” of protective equipment, leadership from the WHO and the United States is clearly lacking. This leaves a void to be filled by others, as — believe it or not — Russia, China, and Taiwan have. Instead of portraying these acts of aid through the lens of fear-mongering and suspicion, other countries should recognize that thegeopolitical significanceof aid only speaks to its necessity.\r\nOf course, it would be naive to think that countries are doing this purely out of goodwill and devoid of any diplomatic considerations. In fact, they have much to gain by helping (of course, only if their aid isactually helpful). But that’s beside the point. After all, so goes any act of international cooperation — we all stand to gain from helping each other, and countries are thankful for aid, regardless of its source, because aid is necessary. We should be wary of the strings attached, if any, but we should also thank the countries that reached out and hold those that turned their backs accountable.\r\nIn the aftermath of World War I, countries refused to interact internationally. The U.S.embraced isolationismwhile France and the United Kingdom appeased Adolf Hitler’s ascent, eager to avoid international conflicts at all costs. They reasoned that the lives abroad are not worth a life at home. The League of Nations, designed to foster international cooperation, was effectively powerless, with no capacity to preventthe next war.\r\nBut in a globalized world, national crises do not contain themselves within artificial borders. In the form of refugee crises, threats of invasion and terrorism, second wave infections, and economic burdens, they come back to haunt us, sometimes with increased ferocity. Therefore, isolationism must not be a lasting consequence from the pandemic, especially as current issues, like climate change, are increasingly global and require global collaboration. Let us hope that the WHO (which must now weathercriticism and decreased support), and other international organizations, will not follow in the League of Nations’ demise, but be strengthened and revitalized after this global crisis.\r\nToday, we know better than before. We have medical knowledge about viral pathogens, hindsight from historical failures of international cooperation, requisite technology for constant communication, and cultural knowledge for respectful exchanges. Today, we have the toolbox to defeat an international crisis without sacrificing ourselves. We should use it actively and responsibly. And we should definitely not burn it to fan the flames of nationalist fervor.\r\nJustin Y. C.
