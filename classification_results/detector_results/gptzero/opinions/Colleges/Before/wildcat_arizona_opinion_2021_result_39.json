All sorts of websites were either being invented or gaining traction. Facebook was dominating the social media industry, YouTube was becoming a household name for watching video content and then there was Twitch, which was one of the first websites to capitalize on the concept of gaming streams.\nBeing exposed to all of this change, an impressionable 12-year-old me found herself gravitating towards the side of the internet that was filled with, what we call now, gaming content. To give a brief definition of what it is, depending on the creator, gaming content is essentially recordings of another person playing video games. I remember being so obsessed with watching those kinds of videos, made by gaming creators like PewDiePie, ChilledChaos, CaptainSparklez. And whenever my parents saw me watching these types of videos so intently on my fourth generation iPod, I was always asked this question:\n“How do you find watching someone else play a video game so entertaining?”\nIn hindsight, I can understand my parent’s confusion. Video games were meant to be played. Where’s the fun that comes from watching someone else have fun? 12-year-old me may have had a hard time coming up with a reasonable answer for that question, but now, I have plenty of reasons that explain the entertainment value that comes from watching gaming streams.\nA lot has changed since the early 2010s, and while it may have initially been viewed as bizarre, gaming streams have risen to a level of both immense popularity to the general public and profitability for many companies. Platforms such as Twitch have seen an increase in viewer engagement, an average of over 17.55 million daily users by 2019, according toThe Conversation writer, Joel Abrams.\nClearly, there is an appeal to video game streaming, but what exactly is up with the hype? Well, I could ask the exact same question to someone who watches football games. What the two forms of entertainment have in common is gratification for the viewer. And luckily for us, there have been scientific studies conducted that illustrate the influence that gratification has, especially within a gaming setting.\nAccording to an article from the journal “Computers in Human Behavior,” results from this particular study revealed that “all five classes of gratification (cognitive, affective, social, tension release, and personal integrative) were significantly associated with the main outcome variables related to how many hours and how many streamers individual users watch.”\nThe five classes of gratification refer to the scientific theory titled “The Uses and Gratification Theory,” which talks about the effects certain forms of media have on people. This concept applies to a gaming stream setting for the following reasons:\nSome may think that those who enjoy gaming content would have to be in the younger age demographic. Like I’ve noted, I started getting into these kinds of videos when I was a young teenager, however, according to data collected by the websiteStream Scheme,41% of viewers on Twitch are between the ages of 16 to 24 years old.\nYoung adults and college students like myself make up a large portion of the consumption of this form of entertainment, and such interest is easily reflected amongst both the media and college campuses. Take a look at the University of Arizona. Not only does the college have a student gaming club with over 1,700 members, but as of March of this year, has launched its very first varsity Esports program, according to an interview conducted by fellowDaily Wildcatreporter, Jacob Mennuti.\nWhy is this such a huge deal? Well for one, the Esports industry as a whole is worth over $1.1 billion according toesports.net, and it is expected to continue to grow. So it was only a matter of time until colleges, especially the University of Arizona would hop onto the trend. Not just that, but Esports (which for clarification is playing computer/video games competitively) have played a huge role in growing the gaming industry. Before the Esports program became a UA funded program, the gaming club had been doing its part in introducing both competitive and casual gamers to the possibilities that this industry holds.\nWith this highlighted platform as well as a newly renovatedArizona Esports Arena, it can be reasonably assumed that the UA Esports program will start to branch out into the lives of everyday college gamers and perhaps even introduce new students to the industry.\nJust like how sports programs draw so many spectators, it’s very well expected that the Esports program will bring in the same results. I’m quite confident that with the university’s recognition of the Esports industry, it’ll lead to a better understanding and appreciation of the gaming industry itself. And now, whenever someone questions the entertainment value of video gaming streams, they can simply read this article as well as the many other articles that praise the streaming industry. And, if you need to figure it out yourself, simply just log onto Twitch and pick the first streaming video that catches your eye.\nFollow Tereza onTwitter\n\nTereza Rascon (she/her) is a junior majoring in English.
