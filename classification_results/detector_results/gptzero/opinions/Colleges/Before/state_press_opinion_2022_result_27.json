            "inputText": "\"Dear State Press, you've got mail.\" Illustration published on Friday, March 3, 2017.\nA recentopinion piecefrom The State Press expressed opposition to President Michael Crow’s salary as just approved by the Arizona Board of Regents. Let me speak for our Board in response.\nI appreciate that the author gives credit to Crow’s leadership moving ASU from a party school to a research \"powerhouse,\" keeping average student debt of an ASU graduateat approximately half of the national average and avoiding tuition increases. But the author then inexplicably treats these as accomplishments unworthy of justifying the president's salary.\nSo let me broaden the picture.\nThe net result is that more students, of broader diversity, have access to a degree, more ways to get it and at a lower cost. And most importantly, today's ASU degree will earn its graduates far more than it used to.\nIt is worthwhile to point out that in 2021, 45% of undergraduates from ASU graduated with no debt, according to theABOR FY 21 Financial Aid Report.\nI suspect many students appreciate that and the leadership that brought us here.\nThe framers backed the \"nearly free as possible\" commitment in the Arizona Constitution with a revenue provision later in the Constitution, which reads: \"The legislature shall make such appropriations, to be met by taxation, as shall insure the proper maintenance of all state educational institutions, and shall make such special appropriations as shall provide for their development and improvement.\"\nRead together, the framers' intent is clear.\nFinally, the author cites the Charter and argues that ASU's \"responsibility to the community\" is more important than goals like student enrollment. Frankly, I can't think of a higher demonstration of ASU's responsibility to the community than growing student enrollment and degree attainment.\nGrowing degree attainment changes family trajectory, broadens equitable opportunity, adds value to our workforce and economic value to our state. Arizona has among the lowest attainment rates in the country and a low-average family income. The economic correlation between degree attainment and economic growth is demonstrably well-established.\nBut there's more. Today's ASU is conducting breakthrough research in areas from energy to healthcare to technology that will improve our lives. And the net result is literally billions of dollars in economic value to our region and state that didn't exist before.\nCrow is widely heralded as one of the most effective higher education leaders in the country, and I daresay the world. Recruiters knock on his door regularly with fat checkbooks. Both our state and our students are better off because the Regents retain him with a salary that reflects his worth in a very competitive marketplace for talent.\nEditor’s Note: The opinions presented in this letter to the editor are the author's and do not imply any endorsement fromThe State Press or its editors.
