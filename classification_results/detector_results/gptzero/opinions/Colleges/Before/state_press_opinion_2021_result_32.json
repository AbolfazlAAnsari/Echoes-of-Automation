            "inputText": "\"SAILS removed students from the early registration list without notifying them in the middle of a stressful pandemic.\" Illustration published on Monday, March 22, 2021.\nMany students who are registered with Student Accessibility and Inclusive Learning Services, orSAILS, have an accommodation to get early registration for classes each semester. This gives students with disabilities an opportunity to have more time to choose professors and class times that best guaranteestudent success.\nThis semester, however, things are looking a bit different. SAILS said after updating its system last summer, some students who did not require the early registration accommodation were added to the list.\nSAILS then reviewed student applications to determine who qualified for access to early registration for theFall 2021 semester and removed those who did not qualify from its list. A small percentage of the 5,500 students registered with SAILS were affected by this change but were not notified of the fact that they would not be receiving early registration this upcoming semester.\nAlthough this only affects a relatively small number of people, it is still problematic as it indicates a larger problem within disability accommodations at ASU. The fact that students must request the accommodations in the first place and prove to SAILS they need additional resources is ableist and goes against the inclusivity and accessibility SAILS exists to facilitate.\nREAD MORE:Some students with disabilities no longer receiving early class registration\nYeah, my registration date used to be the first day it opened but is now about a week and a half after that. Luckily, I'm going to be past my coursework and working on my prospectus so it won't affect me, but this is shitty and needs addressed. Thank you for advocating for us!\nI think this was an inappropriate time to make this change. Students are already dealing with high levels of stress, especially those with disabilities who have been struggling with isolation and mental health.\nThis change may have been more acceptable if they did a better job of informing students of the change, but the issue is that they did not.\n\"It was interesting how everyone found out,\" said Carolyn Griffiths, a faculty associate with theSchool of Social and Behavioral Sciences. \"It sounds like it's still unknown who is affected.\"\nIn my experience, I did not receive any notification of this change. I only discovered that I did not get early registration when I googled thedates myselfand realized I wasn’t scheduled to register until a couple of weeks after the early registration date, which was in February.\nAlthough this wasn’t the end of the world for me, it was an inconvenience. I normally like to plan my class schedules in advance, as registering can be a very stressful time for me. Luckily, I was still able to get all of my classes, but I still worry about other students who may be in a more desperate situation.\nAs I was trying to get my accommodation back, I was asked to disclose why I needed this accommodation. While it may seem like a minor and harmless question, I did find it a bit harmful.\nDisabilities come in all forms, some with visibility and some without. Illustration originally published on Sunday, April 18, 2021.\nPeople with disabilities shouldn’t be obligated to explain their condition to anyone. It also feels like they are asking students to prove that they are “disabled enough,” which reminds me of the harmful stereotype that people with disabilities arefaking it.\nI also believe that people with disabilitiesshould not have toperform emotional laborandexplain their diagnosisin order to getsimple accommodations.\nThe idea of giving students early registration based on “need” feels invasive.Barrett studentsandstudent-athletesdo not needearly registration, but they still get it with no questions asked. So why do students with disabilities, amarginalized group,have to prove themselves when asking for early registration?\nSome may argue that this advantage that students with disabilities get is unfair. I disagree with that. Students with disabilities are statisticallyless likely to have completed a bachelor's degree, so if there are small ways in which a university can help, they should.\nIf students are registered with SAILS, why do they have to jump through hoops for every single accommodation? If they weren’t disabled enough, they wouldn’thavequalifiedto be with SAILS in the first place.\nIf a student was affected by this change, Griffiths suggestedthe best course of action is to communicate. She recommended that these students reach out totheir academic advisors, as well as communicating with SAILS about how the change impacted them and if it altered their ability to get the classes they needed.\nEven if it is too late for students registered with SAILS to request early registration for the fall semester, students can still reach out to their SAILS coordinator to get earlyregistration for Spring 2022.\nIf SAILS wants to have the word “accessible” in its name, it should deliver. Making it more difficult for students to get accommodations is not the way to go if you want to be accessible.\nReach the columnist athtenore@asu.eduor follow@haleyyhmton Twitter.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
