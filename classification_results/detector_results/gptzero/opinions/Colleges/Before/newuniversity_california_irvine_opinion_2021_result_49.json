The legislation unjustly states that only men can succeed the throne and have their children recognized as heirs. Although Japan’s patriarchy always remained present throughout history, the Imperial House of Law set that system into stone within the imperial family.\nAs a result of the Imperial House of Law, Japan’s royal family now faces a major issue that further underscores the monarchy’s destined obsolescence; the royal family isdecreasing in sizebecause women cannot succeed to the throne and lose their royal status when marrying a commoner. Regardless of whether or not Mako married Komouro or someone of royal blood, Mako was always denied the right to pass down her royalty in the first place. Following Mako’s marriage, the royal family is now composed of eight women and five men, only one of which, Mako’s 15-year-old brotherPrince Hisahito, can inherit the throne.
