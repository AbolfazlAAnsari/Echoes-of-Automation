TheHFPA’s planto atone for their past and to neatly resolve this PR nightmare includes a laundry list of reforms: an expansion of their board of directors and members to include more BIPOC voices, a five-year partnership with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and greater oversight and restrictions on gift-receiving, to name a few.\nThough these ideas are all well and good, some normalcy might actually be what audiences are yearning for. A return to the basic values and principles that unite us all in the movie-watching experience is much needed. While representation is important, so is escapism. We often indulge in movies because they transport us away from our realities, which have become increasingly characterized bygrowing wealth inequality, racial divide and the constant culture war. And as the lives of ordinary people seem to be at the mercy of an uncontrollable virus, many of us see right through the veneer of these ceremonies. The entertainment industry is so obsessed with virtue-signaling and being on the right side of history that it has left its audience in the dust.\nNevertheless, the Golden Globes will inevitably make their comeback in 2023, seeing that they make good on their promises for more inclusivity. Perhaps industry insiders and devoted cinephiles may still want to see what goes on at the Globes and who takes home a golden statuette, though it’s safe to say that the majority of Americans couldn’t be less interested.\nA word of advice to Hollywood and the HFPA — or whoever is listening:\nNo one at home wants to sit through another acceptance speech bemoaning fossil fuels and the dire need to save our planet from a person who likely flew in for the awards by way of a private jet.
