            "inputText": "With more thantwo million peopleaffected worldwide, the novel coronavirus is exposingsocial inequities. In a study of COVID-19 and youth, about90 percentof infected children developed mild to moderate symptoms while only 0.6 percent suffered more severe complications. Yet true to the theme of exacerbated inequality, some populations of youth are at a higher risk than this overall average would suggest.\r\nCompared to other children, children in the juvenile justice system aredisproportionately more likelyto have compromised immunity, asthma, and other underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk for developing acute coronavirus complications. While there has been much attention paid to different vulnerable populations in our society, juvenile detainees, as usual, are often left out of the conversation.\r\nThere are an estimated43,000 juvenilesin detention centers around the country today. Housed in sometimes squalid, overcrowded conditions, this population is particularly vulnerable to the threats posed by the COVID-19. Lawyers areadvocating for the immediate releaseof these children and for changes in detention centers’ operation. To avoid a calamity, these changes need to happen now.\r\nConsider Houston, where Harris County Juvenile Detention Center officialsreportedover three weeks ago that a teenager in the facility had tested positive for COVID-19. Now inside confined facility walls, the virus will likelyspread like wildfire. In some juvenile jails, detainees share communal bathrooms and eating areas, making it even easier for the virus to spread. College dorms pose a similar issue and Harvard students were sent home to avoid the need for similarly close contact. In prisons, typical prevention strategies, such as washing or sanitizing hands, are of little use, as these teenagers may not have access to soap andhand sanitizer is considered contraband. With such dire conditions, juvenile detention centers have already become majorhotspotsfor coronavirus.\r\nJuvenile detainees are also disproportionately affected by mental health issues, and family visits remain a vital source of their social and emotional support. As prisonsacross the countrysuspend visits, they lose face to face contact with their parents and family. This will have a detrimental impact on the emotional well-being of these children,two-thirdsof whom have preexisting mental health issues. The loss of visitation rights also affects parents, who aredistraughtabout losing contact with their kids. Although some detention centers are providing opportunities for contact overvideo conferencein lieu of in-person visits, not all families have access to this technology.\r\nMany states are alsosuspendingcritically important educational and rehabilitative programs in juvenile detention facilities. Children involved in the juvenile justice system often have lower literacy levels and most willnever graduatefrom high school. These children need education to help them reintegrate into society and find a job when they are released. Although some detention centers have providedinstructional packetsfor juvenile detainees, it is unclear how education will continue in the long term. Interruptions in their education will exacerbate gaps between these youth and their peers, decreasing the chances of their successful re-entry and further isolating them from their communities. To address these issues, lawyers and civil rights activists have demanded theimmediate releaseof as many children as possible and a temporary reduction or halt in admissions into detention centers.\r\nDespite the urgent need, the response of state juvenile justice systems has been slow and inconsistent. While some states haveimplementedbasic social distancing measures, efforts to release currently detained children or halt the admissions have been variable. While California issued anorderthat will temporarily halt new admits into the juvenile justice system, Nebraskarefusedto issue a blanket policy changing the operations of detention centers. And in New York, detainees aresuingdetention centers for failing to release juveniles — even as dozens of adults are being released from jails.\r\nWith a rapidly changing pandemic, the condition of these children remains uncertain. It is evident, however, that if policymakers do not act swiftly and appropriately, the coronavirus will only compound the physical and emotional vulnerability already facing detained youth. Decision-makers should respond similar to Harvard administrators — too much too soon rather than too little too late.\r\nFenella McLuskie is a first-year student at Harvard Law School.
