            "inputText": "We, the undersigned members of the Stanford community, condemn in the strongest terms possible the state of Israel’s systematic destruction of Palestinian property, homes and lives. The recent expulsion of Palestinians from their rightful homes in Sheikh Jarrah — which, along with Israel’s violent attack on peaceful worshippers at al-Aqsa mosque during the holy period of Ramadan, has precipitated the violence we see unfolding — is but one part of an unbroken history stretching back to the 1948 massacre of over 100 Palestinian men, women and children in the village ofDeir Yassin. Then, as now, Zionists reached beyond UN-mandated borders to expel and kill Palestinians and illegally seize their land. In the recent decade, Israeli policies have become even more aggressive.\nThe 2018 “New Basic Law of Israel” makes three fundamental claims:\nWith terrible clarity then, Israel has declared itself an ethno-nation and converted acts illegal under international law (such as annexing Palestine land, undertaking the collective punishment of Palestinians, abrogating its responsibilities as an occupying power, denying Palestinians in exile their human right to return, et cetera) into legitimate (in solely its own view) manifestations of its “self-determination.” We in the United States are all too familiar with how a similar evocation of “Manifest Destiny” legitimated genocide against Indigenous peoples.\nSuch single-mindedness of purpose makes Israel’s attested commitment to the “equality” of all citizens a lie. Despite this attestation, more than 51 discriminatory laws imposed by Israel against Palestinians have not been removed from the books and are still enacted regularly. “Equality” cannot possibly exist in an ethno-state whose very existence has been declared an apartheid state byHuman Rights Watch. This apartheid takes the form of separate roads, resources, electrical systems, schools, curtailed freedom of movement for Palestinians.\nIn a recent piece in the New York Times (“Palestinian Refugees Deserve to Return Home. Jews Should Understand”), Peter Beinart, Editor-at-Large of Jewish Currents, draws the connection between the historical Nakba and the present day:\nWhy has the impending eviction of six Palestinian families in East Jerusalem drawn Israelis and Palestinians into a conflict that appears to be spiraling toward yet another war? Because of a word that in the American Jewish community remains largely taboo: the Nakba.\nThe Nakba, or ‘catastrophe’ in Arabic, need not refer only to the more than 700,000 Palestinians who were expelled or fled in terror during Israel’s founding. It can also evoke the many expulsions that have occurred since: the about 300,000 Palestinians whom Israel displaced when it conquered the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967; the roughly 250,000 Palestinians who could not return to the West Bank and Gaza after Israel revoked their residency rights between 1967 and 1994; the hundreds of Palestinians whose homes Israel demolished in 2020 alone. The East Jerusalem evictions are so combustible because they continue a pattern of expulsion that is as old as Israel itself.\nIn Gaza in particular, Friends of the Earth, an environmental organization, found such deplorable conditions that it issued a report entitled, precisely,“Environmental Nakba”:\nThe observer mission witnessed numerous examples of expropriation of land and water resources and heard testimonies of officials, researchers, local people and environmental activists. We observed industrial sites with little or no controls on emissions, untreated sewage piped from urban developments onto open land and streams and waste hills from decades of uncontrolled dumping. We heard of the destruction of trees and the polluting of agricultural land and surface water. This report documents some of these observations, and provides some suggestions for collaborative projects in Palestine, either by further researches or solidarity support for the affected communities.\nThe carnage we see today cannot be excused through any notion that Israel has a right to “protect itself.” Its violent and often deadly expulsions of Palestinians from their homes, its armed attack on ordinary Palestinians and others worshipping during Ramadan — these actions logically extend to Palestinians the right to defend themselves first.\nThe disproportionate violence perpetrated by Israel — whose possession of high-tech defense systems, armaments and war equipment is in large part funded by American taxpayers — is inexcusable, as is the United States’ continued diplomatic protection of illegal Israeli actions.\nWe reject any attempt to portray this as the fault of the Palestinian people, and deplore the slaughter of innocent men, women and children, and the crippling of an already weak Palestinian infrastructure. We urge everyone to refuse to be complicit with Israeli “business as usual,” and to consider endorsing theBoycott, Divestment and Sanctions(BDS) movement, begun by over 170 civil organizations in Palestine. This non-violent form of protest, consciously modeled after the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa, allows people of principle worldwide to act in solidarity with the Palestinian people. Thegovernment of South Africahas in fact come out in support of BDS — Nelson Mandela and Bishop Desmond Tutu were early and vocal supporters of the movement.\nBDS and more generally protests against Israel’s persistent violation of international law and international human rights are not the purview solely of “radicals” or leftists. Full or partial divestment from Israel has been declared by religious groups such as the USMennoniteorganization, thePresbyterian Church, USA,United Church of Christ, the pension fund of theUnited Methodist Church, several Quaker branches (American Friends Service Committee) and others. The Palestinian cause has received the support of Jewish groups such asJewish Voice for Peaceand Israeli human rights groups likeB’Tselem.\nThe financial sector too is wary of investing in businesses in the Occupied Territories both because of their illegality and their instability — just two examples: Bill Gates divested from a British firm for its connections with Israeli security forces; a major Dutch pension firm has also divested. Those fighting for Palestinian rightsnow includegroups like the Movement for Black Lives, and labor unions have refused to unload and transport goods from the Occupied Territories. Theanalogybetweenanti-Black racismand the persecution of the Palestinians has been the subject of much commentary.\nWe join all those working for basic human rights and the respect of international law in condemning Israel for its brutality and violence, and pledge solidarity with the Palestinian people.\nSigned,\nUmniya Najaer PhD Student in Modern Thought and LiteratureMarci Kwon Assistant Professor, Art HistoryTobias Wolff, Professor of EnglishJonathan Rosa Associate Professor of Education & Comparative Studies in Race & EthnicityUsha Iyer Assistant Professor, Art and Art HistoryMartabel Wasserman PhD CandidateSharika Thiranagama Associate Professor of AnthropologySuhaila Meera PhD candidateDavid Palumbo-Liu, Louise Hewlett Nixon Professor & Professor of Comparative LiteratureVaughn Rasberry, Associate Professor of English and Comparative Studies in Race and EthnicityJean Ma Associate Professor, ArtThomas Hansen Professor of AnthropologyPatricia Alessandrini Assistant Professor, Music/CCRMAKabir Tambar Associate Professor, AnthropologyOlamide Abiose JD/PhD Candidate in NeuroscienceJoshua Cobler Class of 2020Kerem Ussakli PhD Student, Department of AnthropologyNina Dewi Toft Djanegara PhD candidate, Department of AnthropologyShikha Nehra PhD Student, Department of AnthropologyNataya Friedan PhD Candidate in AnthropologyAaron Sherman Hopes PhD Candidate in AnthropologyLaura Ng Stanford PhD candidateAnna Bigelow Associate Professor, Religious StudiesPriya Satia Raymond A.
