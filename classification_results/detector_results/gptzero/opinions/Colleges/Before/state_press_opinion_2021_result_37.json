            "inputText": "\"Whether you consider yourself a political person or not, political involvement is unavoidable in today's society.\" Illustration published Wednesday, Feb. 24, 2021.\nAt mention of the word \"politics,\" there always seems to be a collective groan that follows. The term has acquired a negative connotation after the past few election cycles, leaving many people withdrawn from any sort of political discussion.\nAccording toPew Research Center, the country's polarizing politics have stopped nearly half of U.S. adults from discussing political and election news with someone because of something they said.\nThis movement in polarizing politics is leading to the increasing prevalence of the term 'apolitical.' People who are apolitical often say things like, \"I like to stay out of politics,\" \"I don't enjoy politics,\" or my personal favorite, \"politics don't affect me.\"\nThe ability to disengage from politics is a luxury. Many people are not so fortunate to be able to completely disassociatefrom political developments.\nDue to the pandemic,more than 50 million peoplein the U.S. may experience food insecurity. In 2019,34 millionAmericans lived in poverty,over 500,000 were homelessand more than82 million workers 16 and older were paid hourly rates. These people care about politics.\nIn recent months, more evidence has unveiledracial and ethnic minority groups are being disproportionately affected by COVID-19due to issues such as poverty and low healthcare access.\nIn 2019,54% of those who died as a result of police violenceand whose race was identified, were people of color, compared to 50% in 2014. These issues have gained public attention through the Black Lives Matter movement.\nPolitics matter to all of these people affected, and they are using their right to protest in political matters to see change.\nWhy do these people care about politics? Because the way we live our lives is political. We live in a democratic society where the ability to participate in the political process is crucial.\nMakenzie Tyson, a junior studying political science and justice studies, also on theBridgeASUEvents Committee, believes political participation is vitalto get anything accomplished.\nTyson said the famous quote fromPericles, \"Just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn't mean politics won't take an interest in you,\" inspires her activism.\n\"This quote should serve as a reminder to those who sit comfortably and disassociate themselves from politics that not only is engagement important, but that it can be a matter of life or death for many individuals,\" Tyson said.\nIf you relinquish your right to participate in the political process, it doesn't mean important issues will get solved without your input. It simply means you are giving up your rights to participate,resigning yourself toan outcome someone else will decide for you.\nSimple steps to engaging more in politics are educating yourself — an action made simpler by access to reliable information online — and engaging in community events.\n\"The greatest recommendation I could give anyone, especially students, is to get involved with current events,\" Tyson said. \"It is important that we hold ourselves and our elected officials accountable for unjust acts.\"\nStudents can start off small by joining clubs, doing research or finding an issue affecting them directly. This could be as simple as potholes in your neighborhood consistently complicating your route to work. What can you do about this?\nFirst, look into the issue and contact local organizations. Local politics are just as important as national. Attend a town hall meeting, call a representative and become involved, but make sure your actions support your awareness.\nOne advantage students have in the process of becoming more politically engaged is access to numerouspolitical organizationson campus.\n\"We host open discussions on current events to seek new perspectives and share our own thoughts with the main goal of creating a safe space where all students feel like they are heard,\" Tyson said of BridgeASU.\nMany people refrain from political participation because they don't want to be associated with a specific party. However, there is a huge difference between political affiliation and political participation.\nPeople don't need to join a political party or side with a perspective; simply understanding the importance of our political system and finding issues important to youcan increase engagement.\nThe first step to political participation is education, but the steps following involve actions like engaging in respectful conversation about politics, staying informed on political news and sharing your thoughts and concerns with politicians who represent you.\nThe more people become engaged, the more power they have to come together to advocate for progress in the issues they care about.\nReach the columnist atatretsch@asu.eduor follow@alexistretschokon Twitter.\nEditor’s note: The opinions presented in this column are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
