He writes on behalf of theCoalition for a True School of Sustainability; the statements in this article are personal opinions and do not reflect the official views of the US Department of Energy or Stanford University.\nStanford recentlyannouncedthe launch of the Doerr School of Sustainability. Despite receiving founding gifts totaling $1.7 billion, the school’s incoming dean hasindicated thatthe school would still work with and accept funding from fossil fuel companies. This openness to fossil fuel funding is not hypothetical: the Doerr School iscurrently slated to absorbnumerous fossil fuel-funded programs currently housed in the Stanford School of Earth. Such funding poses serious reputational risks to Stanford and the Doerr School, which mighthave its name usedto promote climate denial, greenwashing and policies that delay climate action. In response to this criticism, Dean Arun Majumdarelaboratedthat climate change requires an “all hands on deck approach.”\nAlthough this approach might appear reasonable, it would be prudent to verify whether fossil fuel companies are indeed honest deckhands or, instead, mutineers. After all, fossil fuel producershave knownabout fossil-derived CO2emissionssince the 1950s, and have denied or downplayed climate changesince 1980. In fact, the industry has used Stanford’s name tosuggestthat fossil fuels are essential to sustain growth while avoiding economic disaster. Furthermore, in 2006, then-CEO of ExxonMobil Rex Tillersoncited a $100 million contribution to Stanford’s Global Climate and Energy Projectas evidence that the company is investing in renewable research, while ExxonMobil alsotold investorsit would dedicate 1000 times more funds over the same time period to searching for new oil and gas reserves.\nThese seven decades of history are not lost on Dean Majumdar, whoproposes asking four questionsto suss out potential bad actors. In this article, we will answer these questions for Stanford’s fossil fuel partners in order to further our shared goal of a truly sustainable Doerr School.\nAccording to theCoalition for a True School of Sustainability, the University’s known fossil fuel partners include: BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, EcoPetrol, Eni, Equinor, ExxonMobil, JX Nippon (since 2020: ENEOS), Occidental, Petrobras, PetroChina, Phillips 66, Repsol, Saudi Aramco, Shell, SK Energy and Total. For simplicity, we will refer to these companies as Stanford’s “Partners.” Stanfordalso engages withthe American Petroleum Institute, a national oil and gas trade association, as well asseveral other fossil-related firmsnot included here.\nWherever possible, we will characterize Stanford’s fossil-fuel Partners individually toavoid painting the entire industry with the same brush. This approach aligns with Stanford’s Board of Trustees2020 commitment to the Paris Agreement: the Board eschews blanket fossil divestments, instead encouraging a case-by-case evaluation. With this in mind, we can address Dean Majumdar’s four questions.\n1.Are [a Partner’s] commitments aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement?\nTheParis Agreementaims to limit the global average temperature increase to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to stay below 1.5 °C. Stanford’s fossil Partners do not appear to be committed to these goals: a2021 paperin the journalScienceanalyzed Stanford’s aforementioned Partners, concluding that only Occidental Petroleum comes close to meeting the Paris Goals. These findings are supported byThe GuardianandOil Change International. Notably, Oil Change International found the climate pledges and plans of eight Stanford Partners to be “grossly insufficient.”\n2.Is [a Partner] devoting sufficient human and financial resources to meet its commitments?\nTo reiterate, most of Stanford’s Partners’ commitments do not align with Paris goals. For these companies, any devoted human and financial resources are therefore insufficient by default. This point is underscored byClimate Action 100+, which judges none of Stanford’s Partners Capital Alignment as ‘aligned’.A 2022 scientific studyreproduces these conclusions for BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell, stating that none of these companies are “currently on the way to a clean energy transition.”\n3.Is [a Partner] supporting and promoting government policy that would create the business imperative for a transition to a clean economy?\nTo answer this question, it would be easy to cherry pick negative examples of fossil-fuel lobbying. This would seemingly disqualify ExxonMobil forlobbyingagainst the European Union’s CO2vehicle standards, and Shell, BP, Equinor and Total forpromoting fossil gasin Europe: these obstructive actionsconflict with Dean Majumdar’s personal beliefs. However, it might be more objective to judge companies for their overall lobbying behavior. To this end,LobbyMaplists the lobbying behavior of Stanford’s fossil fuel Partners. It finds most of these Partners to obstruct climate policy and five Partners to express mixed positions. Notably, LobbyMap considers the American Petroleum Institute to be “broadly hostile to climate policy in the US.” The Institute counts multiple Stanford Partners among itsmembers.\nFurthermore,according to Dean Majumdar, a company sometimes needs to “produce oil and gas to avoid significant disruptions to human welfare, the economy and national security in the short term.” In this case, one should ask:\n4. Does it still intend to meet its climate commitments in the long term?\nHere, Dean Majumdar suggests that exceptional circumstances might justify temporarily increased fossil fuel production if producers still commit to long-term climate goals. Evaluating this question, we can assess how fossil fuel companies act during the Covid-19 pandemic or Russia’s (#3 global oil producer) invasion of Ukraine. According toInfluence Map, the American Petroleum Institute has usedbothcrisesto lobby for rolling back existing or planned climate policy standards: these are not good signs.\nOverall, it appears like Dean Majumdar’squestionshave no positive answers. This is not to say that no well-intentioned people work at or with Stanford’s fossil fuel Partners: we personally know many such people. However, we must also recognize that the overall behavior of Stanford’s Partners appears inconsistent with Dean Majumdar’s criteria and the Board of Trustees’ commitments to the Paris Agreement.\nIf Stanford engages with these Partners at an institutional level, it should therefore consider the risks. Should Stanford expose itself to whatresearchers describeas greenwashing and ideological climate denialism? Does Stanford intend to help fossil-fuel companiesexplore unconventional oil, even though the IEAdeems further oil exploration incompatiblewith net-zero goals? Both Stanford and the Doerr School should weigh these questions carefully.\nIn summary, the research cited here suggests that Stanford’s current fossil-fuel Partners do not even remotely match Dean Majumdar’s criteria and the Board of Trustees’ Paris commitment. Although our concerns with fossil-fuel engagementextend beyondmerely meeting these requirements, discussing these concerns might be more appropriate once the Dean’s and Board’s minimum criteria are met. For now, accepting funding from fossil-fuel companies at the institutional level should be a non-starter if Dean Majumdar and the Board intend to follow their own guidelines.\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and  letters to the editor.
