In this historic moment, we have a particular obligation to report and publish on the ongoing movements and protests. However, we have an even greater responsibility to listen to and support the community we serve. Black communities are making themselves heard around the world — and we are listening, with a commitment to amplifying these perspectives in our publication not just in times of crisis, but at all times in the future. We recognize the power of journalism and our ability to use our platform to uplift Black voices and narratives.\nWe also recognize the responsibility that such power brings. To that end, we acknowledge the difficult relationship between the media and Black community members, particularly at Stanford. We do not pretend to fully understand the experiences of Stanford’s Black community, but we know we can do more to diversify our coverage, engage with our community respectfully and make our organization as welcoming to Black community members as possible. We acknowledge that we have not adequately addressed these measures in the past, but this is no excuse for inaction in the present. The Daily would be nothing without its readers, its contributors and its critics, and we welcome any feedback on how we can more proactively share voices from Stanford’s Black community in the future. Doing so will be a priority moving forward.\nRight now, though, our publication joins millions of Americans in demanding accountability for police violence and participating in the ongoing struggle for racial justice. The Daily’s editorial board has compileda non-exhaustive list of resources and materials specific to the Stanford community and the Bay Area. Included are links to donate to bail funds, find essential readings in African and African American studies and act in other important ways to engage the Stanford community in a more lasting effort toward racial justice. We are using these resources to reflect, educate and better The Daily for our Stanford community — we hope you share in this goal.\nRead the Editorial Board resources article here.\nHolden Foreman ’21, editor-in-chiefLiz Lindqwister ’21, deputy editorClaire Dinshaw ’21, opinions editorAdrian Liu ’20, opinions editorLayo Laniyan ’22, opinions desk editor\nContact the editors at opinions ‘at’ stanforddaily.com.\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.
