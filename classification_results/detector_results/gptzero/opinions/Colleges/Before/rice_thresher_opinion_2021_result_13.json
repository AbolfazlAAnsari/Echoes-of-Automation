Duncan College Magister Eden King invited students to join her at the march, providing coffee and donuts beforehand. Baker College Magister Luis Duno-Gottberg brought bagels to some marchgoers before bringing his family along to the march. Even though it might not change the law, the Rice community showing up to support the women’s march was a blueprint for what we can do to help.\nSince SB 8 took effect, many Rice students have wanted to take action, but it hasn’t always been clear what they could do about it. While some have attended protests or set out to raise awareness for issues related to reproductive rights, not everyone has the time or desire to do so, even if they still want to help in some way. Throughout previous editorials, we’ve continuouslycalled forsupportfrom professors and the Rice community on many other important topics, but with only vague ideas as to what that could and should look like. This weekend, and the weeks since the implementation of SB 8, have been a prime example of how to do that. People from all across the Rice community found ways to respond and show support for their classmates and peers in ways big and small. No matter the topic, it is promising to see such a display of solidarity, and we hope that the Rice community continues to band together in this way.\nEditor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board.

As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
