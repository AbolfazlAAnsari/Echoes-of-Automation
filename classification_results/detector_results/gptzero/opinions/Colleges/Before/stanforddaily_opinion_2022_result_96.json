Society’s understanding — and, to some extent, acceptance — of disability remains so rooted in its physical manifestation on the body that any experience of disability falling short of this expectation is deemed invalid.\nThis is not about one form of disability being preferable to the other — rather, this is an observation on how strides made in accessibility that appear concrete and praiseworthy on the surface continue to exclude such a significant portion of the disability community. Those with physical disabilities are by no means exempt from ableist aggressions in the classroom and beyond, and it is definitely true that the degree to which a disability is deemed visually and socially “acceptable” plays a significant role. Other aspects of identity also contribute in important ways, and it is often at these points of intersection that the most severe harm is experienced.\nAt the core, however, I intend to acknowledge that there is privilege in the visibility of my disability. While we are visually inseparable, this overt representation of my needs means that I am rarely required to offer explanation or justification for my situation. In the academic context, the way I show up to class matches up with the recommendations of my OAE letter, and subsequently my needs are almost always met without resistance. Behind every disability there is a hidden story that even a wheelchair cannot fully tell, but at least in my case its presence provides enough information that most are willing to accept my word and embrace the needs with which I present.\nIn contrast, a “non-disabled” appearance has evolved into both a twisted compliment and cutting accusation entangled with a distinct narrow-mindedness and the severely misguided notion that the exaggeration of impairment would somehow be worth society’s “perks.” In a life already defined by obstacles, the task of dissecting and revealing intimate details about the unseen reality of one’s lived experience with disability can be deeply traumatizing. Yet in most circumstances, this all could be avoided through a simple willingness to put faith in both the individual and, in the case of the OAE, the process into which they already poured energy and vulnerability to have this lived experience confirmed in black and white.\nAs Stanford enters a new phase of reimagining disability on our campus with the recentopening of the Disability Community Spaceand other initiatives to tackle institutional barriers, it must be a priority to ensure that all community members feel empowered to request the support they need to thrive and can expect fair treatment in the provisions thereof, regardless of how their particular disability manifests. The burden of proving the legitimacy of disability must be eliminated through increased awareness and inclusive policy, and we remain focused on defining accessibility in terms that are not limited by the assumption that seeing is believing.\nTilly Griffiths ‘22 is a senior from the United Kingdom pursuing a double-major in Political Science and Communication.
