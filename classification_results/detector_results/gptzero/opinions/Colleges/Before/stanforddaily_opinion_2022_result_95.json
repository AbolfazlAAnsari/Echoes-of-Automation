He is now a co-term in Mathematical and Computational Science and Biology at Stanford.\nDear President Biden:\nI am a veteran of the United States Navy. I believe the United States has moral and practical obligations to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. And I encourage you to order the United States military to do just that.\nThe moral argument is obvious. We can. So, we should.\nThe United States is the only country with the ability to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine.\nThe Russian military is killing Ukrainian kindergarteners. The BBC recentlyreported: “Images have also emerged of an attack on a kindergarten in the town of Okhtyrka. The incident killed six people, including a child, according to the city’s mayor.”\nYou cannot give Ukrainian kindergarteners boxes of Javelin and Stinger missiles and expect them to defend themselves against the Russian military.\nAnd we can do more than supply Ukraine with military aid. We can enforce the no-fly zone that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has requested. And we should do that.\nThe practical argument is equally obvious. We can. So, we must.\nYou recentlyexplainedthat “American diplomacy matters”; “American resolve matters.” To that, I would add that American leadership matters. And respect for American strength.\nYour response to Putin’s invasion is setting a precedent that cannot be easily overturned.\nYourrefusalto enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine sets a bad precedent.\nYou are teaching Putin that America will not lead when it really matters, when he orders the military invasion of peaceful democracies, and when he bombs kindergarteners.\nAnd you are teaching Putin that American strength withers when it really matters, when he orders the military invasion of peaceful democracies, and when he bombs kindergarteners.\nWe can do more than supply Ukraine with military aid. We can enforce the no-fly zone that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has requested. And we must do that.\nI encourage you to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine.\nVery respectfully,\nAdam Behrendt\nStanford University\nClass of 2023\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and  letters to the editor.
