Illustration originally published on Tuesday, Oct. 5, 2021.\nEarlier this semester, thePac-12announced it will form an alliance with theAtlantic Coast ConferenceandBig Ten, allowing for interconference matchups that could help propel ASU football to the national spotlight.\nAnother opportunity that could expand ASU's competition is the potential expansion of the College Football Playoff. TheCollege Football Playoff, a postseason event in which the top four teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision compete for the national title,has been a controversial topic in college sports.\nCurrently, only the four teams selected by a committee make the playoff bracket, but a feasibility study was approved last summer to look into the proposed expansion from four to 12 teams. An approval of the expansion is still in question, but it should be expanded — and Pac-12 Commissioner George Kliavkoff agrees.\n\"The Pac-12 is 100% in favor of an expansion of the College Football Playoff,\" Kliavkoff said in an Augustpress conferenceannouncing the alliance.\nThe more teams that are in the playoffs, the increased chance a Pac-12 team has to make the playoffs. In the seven-year history of the College Football Playoff, only twice has a Pac-12 team made it: Oregon in the 2014-15 playoffs and Washington in the 2016-17 playoffs.\nIncreasing the College Football Playoff to more than four teams will make the playoffs more of a tournament instead of two games. It will also broaden the bracket by increasing the number of teams involved. After almost every season of college football, more than four teams deserve a shot at theCollege Football Playoff National Championship Trophy.\nSchedulingfor the new alliance will begin in the coming years, as there is no set agreement yet. Thevisionfor scheduling is that each team will play two games, one home and one away, per season against teams from the other conferences.\nSince the alliance will bring in additional games against teams in the Big Ten and ACC, ASU football’s interconference schedule will consistently stay strong, year after year. Winning tough interconference games will bringnationwide legitimacyto the Pac-12, including ASU football, helping the team's chances of getting into the College Football Playoff picture, especially if the bracket expands.\nASU football would have the opportunity to play some schools for the first time in history, including Clemson, Georgia Tech and Indiana University. These games could be nationally broadcasted to football fans on both coasts, expanding ASU’s exposure and possibly generating more Sun Devils fans across America.\nBorn and raised in South Florida, I grew up a fan of theUniversity of Miami, a university in the ACC. With the alliance, ASU will have a chance to play Miami for the first time since1997. I am looking forward to the day my college team plays against my hometown team for the first time in my life.\nInterconference games bring together different cultures of football. The305is a culture of its own. In the 1980s,The Uwas known as the \"Bad Boys\" in college football, bringing swagger and attitude like no other. Currently, Miami is not as strong as its dynasty in the 80s was, but the culture is still there. Bringing that culture to the Valley of the Sun will be an interesting matchup that I am excited to see.\nRebecca Munn, a junior studying biological sciences, has similar feelings about the alliance. She grew up a fan of Pennsylvania State University, which is in the Big Ten Conference, thanks to her dad.\n\"I am looking forward to the matchup between ASU and Penn State in the future,\" she said.\nPenn State and ASU only met once before on the football field, way back in 1977 in the Fiesta Bowl. Penn State took the game42-30.\n\"It will be interesting to see the team that I grew up with ... play against the university that I attend now,\" Munn said.\nReach the columnist atamsolom2@asu.eduand follow@_alexmarieon Twitter.\nLikeThe State Presson Facebook and follow@statepresson Twitter.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
