But whenaskedin the Q&A to respond to the experience of a Black community member, who has “never felt welcome or safe on campus,” Drell defaulted to “no easy answer.”\nThe University’s general tenor regarding anti-Black racismin the wake of the Minneapolis uprisinghas not evolved since June.\nIn a June 30messageaddressed to the Stanford community, President Tessier-Lavigne reiterated Provost Drell’s call to action, urging us to come together to confront anti-Black racism under the banner of “Advancing Racial Justice,” all the while suggesting that the end of anti-Black racism on our campus will come about from a change in our “culture.”\nBut to anyone who has read the op-eds published in The Daily or signed the petitions that have circulated since the beginning of June — in support ofthe departmentalization of African and African American Studies (AAAS)andthe funding of the King Center— President Tessier-Lavigne’s words, just like Provost Drell’s, come across as a pure deflection of responsibility.\nInthis statement, the only widely-circulated and published message from Stanford’s top office on the topic of racial equity this calendar year, President Tessier-Lavigne proposes a series of University-wide listening sessions that will be sponsored and facilitated by the offices of the provost and the dean of the school of humanities and sciences. Under this self-study initiative, Black students, postdocs, staff and faculty would voluntarily come forward to both share their experiences and suggest recommendations on how each unit could implement changes going forward. Racial justice, as he explains it, will come about from “hearing the diverse stories of our community members.”\nBut the argument is built on false pretense. Professor Allyson Hobbssaid itfirst: The 47 AAAS majors and their advocates don’t need yet another self-study. Data on anti-Black racism at Stanford already exists. To add tothe teaching and advising crisisin AAAS anddecades-oldunderfunding ofthe King Institute, Stanford has seen, in the last calendar year alone,a noosehanging outside a student dorm, the repeated use of the n-word in class by our very own faculty members across both theLaw Schoolandhumanities and sciencesandracist Zoom bombings.\nThese hate crimes, in addition to countless others that were either not reported or failed to garner media coverage, and the University’s consistentfailure to adequately respondto them, amount to what Black students at Stanford are calling“a pattern of anti-Black violence permeating within this university.”I invite both Provost Drell and President Tessier-Lavigne to venture for five minutes onto#BlackInTheIvoryor#StanfordIsAntiBlack, and dedicate an extra 10 to reading two recent articles onracial profiling at Stanfordandpolicing on campus, to get an idea of the scope of the problem at hand.\nMore troubling still, President Tessier-Lavigne’s call for institutional self-study is a plan devised to0 Commentsfor a robust institutional commitment to confronting anti-Black racism at Stanford. When Black community members are called upon to share their trauma, this kind of racial climate survey becomesyet another uncompensated service requirement.Stanford’s datashows that together, Black undergrads, grads, faculty, postdocs and staff make up less than 4% of our campus community. How can Black community members feel safe when solicited to divulge trauma foran institution that has only ever betrayed them?\nWe don’t need a self-study to know that anti-Black racism must be addressed at the highest level of the University. What needs to be done is not as vague and intangible as President Tessier-Lavigne, orVice Provost Brubaker-Colefor that matter, have made it out to be.\nOver the past six weeks, numerous petitions and Daily op-eds have outlinedexactlywhat needs to happen to confront anti-Black racism at Stanford.\nIn early June, a coalition of Black student organizations brought together by the Black Law Students Association delivereda petitionto President Tessier-Lavigne that called on the University to both disarm campus police and reduce their presence on campus. As it stands, the petition has been endorsed by 140 campus organizations and 2,000 individuals.\nIn mid-June, the Black students and postdocs of the School of Medicine, with support from 25 Black student organizations, detailed0 Commentsdesigned to achieve racial equity at Stanford. These stress the need for immediate action by the University, and transparency in implementation and outcomes.\nSince early July,the aforementioned petitioncreated by the Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA) and the Black Student Union for the departmentalization of AAAS at Stanford has garnered over 5,000 signatures. Recently,the editorial board at The Daily joined their voicesto this cause.\nIt’s now mid-August and under President Tessier-Lavigne’s leadership, Stanford has failed to appropriately address each and every one of these demands.\nBut the duplicity has not gone without notice. Last month the BGSAcalledPresident Tessier-Lavigne’s proposal toward“Advancing Racial Justice”“inadequate.” Campus groups have alsocalled attention tothe ways in which contract negotiations with the Stanford University Department of Public Safety expose the vacuity of the University’s commitment to counteracting systemic racism. With regard to President Tessier-Lavigne’s failure to take immediate action to reduce police presence on campus, he and Provost Drell been called to#StepUpOrStepDown.\nCueinitiativeslikea Solidarity Fund,touted asinstitutional support for community driven “educational and healing efforts,” designed to placate students, stymie negotiation and exhaust campus activists, proof that the University does not intend on engaging the proposals petitioned by Black student groups since early June.\nSo here’s the bottom line for President Tessier-Lavigne, Provost Drell, Vice Provost Brubaker-Cole and their respective offices: Stop soliciting labor from our Black colleagues. Start listening instead to what they havealreadytold you. Put your money where your mouths are anddosomething to curb anti-Black racism at Stanford.\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and letters to the editor.
