College is meant to be one of the most important times of our lives. It's when we learn what it means to be an adult and make personal and professional connections that will last us a lifetime.\nThanks to COVID-19, the majority of students are stuck in their rooms, taking classes online and living what has felt like nearly365 groundhog daysin a row.\nA large number of people believe thatyounger peopleare the reason COVID-19 is spreading so rapidly across the country. They believe that we are all behaving irresponsibly and ignoring guidelines. I feel thatthese claims are untrue— at least for most of us.\n\"There are really responsible students who are doing their best everywhere, and I trust that that is the majority,\" said Diana Ayton-Shenker, a professor at theSchool for the Future of Innovation in Society. Ayton-Shenker co-teachesa series of lectures on the COVID-19 responsethis semester and is also the executive director of theASU-Leonardo Initiative, an art-science research enterprise.\nAsmall, but loud, minorityof college students are ruining any chance of a normal semester for those of us who are obeying guidelines even when ourmental health is suffering.\nWhen many of us think of violating COVID-19 guidelines, we think of gigantic parties on the outskirts of campus. These mass gatherings do happen and they pose a serious threat to the health and safety of our community. However, that doesn’t mean this is the only way that students are breaking guidelines.\n\"Our actions have consequences and each and every one of us has to be responsible for our choices,\" Ayton-Shenker said.\nA major causeof COVID-19 spread in this country comes fromsmall gatherings. Yes, when you sneak your small group of friendsinto your dorm room, you are contributing to the possible spread of COVID-19 in the community.\nAnother factor that Ayton-Shenker brought up was campus location. ASU is a very large community located several major cities. This may make the spread of COVID-19 more difficult to contain in comparison to an isolated college campus.\nThis is where the responsibility falls on federal and state governments to control the pandemic, and as many of us know, the national and state-wide responses to COVID-19 were failures when compared to the rest of the world.\nConsidering how long the pandemic has lasted, it is understandable why people try to violate restrictions and guidelines. When we consider the mental health effects of isolation, it's easy to empathize with those who have violated the protocol. Despite this, it's still a risk.\ncant believe everyday i used to get out of bed and get dressed and walk to a college campus and take courses and walk with my friends to the next class and study in a student center and get coffee and find new study spots and see an albino squirrel and go to professor's offices a\nWe have been in “quarantine” for nearly a year. I put quarantine in air quotes because let's be honest, many of us have beenbending the ruleswhen it comes tosocial distancing. It may just seem like aminor risk, but when everyone is partaking in these minor risks, it can have major consequences.\nAlthough these small gatherings may not be as risky assuperspreader eventssuch as weddings, funerals and parties, they are still major contributors to the spread of COVID-19, according to Ayton-Shenker.\n\"The more contact we have, the more risk there is of spreading infection,\" Ayton-Shenker said. \"Superspreader events have a larger outcome.\"\nMany individuals are experiencing what is known as\"pandemic fatigue,\"which is a lack of motivation caused by the lasting psychological effects of isolation and social distancing.\n\"We initially thought of this crisis as a sprint, but it is actually a marathon,\" Ayton-Shenker said.\nAs with any marathon, it is important we do not slow down just because there is an end in sight. This is the time when weneedto be most resilient. We should begin to feel optimistic as the vaccine begins to roll out, but breaking guidelines will not do us any good.
