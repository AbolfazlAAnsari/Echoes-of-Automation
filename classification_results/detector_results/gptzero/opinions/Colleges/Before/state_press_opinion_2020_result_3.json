            "inputText": "\"Soft skills are what allow people to work in teams to pull off complex projects and navigate the twists and loops of the social workplace.\" Photo illustration published on Thursday, Nov. 12, 2020.\nWith COVID-19 ushering a technologicalwave of innovation, there has been an increasedemphasisonsoft skillsin the job market.\nSoft skills are skills relating to howone works — teamwork, leadership, emotional intelligence (communication and conflict management), maintaining a growth mindset and showing initiative. While these are usually written off as something you learned in high school or picked up working in customer service, employers report they are consistently finding their new hiresfall short of the mark.\nEspecially in a job market that's becomingincreasingly saturatedwith degree-holding individuals, having or not having soft skills could be a deciding factor among suitable candidates.The competitive market will force graduates to look beyond their technical skills gained from college and adapt to competition that wants more than just the hard calculations.\nIf ASU fails to equip grads with the necessary tools to compete, they will face a bleak list of application rejections.\nEmployers hiring STEM applicants find itdifficultto find suitable candidates that also possess strong soft skills in addition to their technical knowledge. Moreover, soft skills help demonstrate to employers that a candidate is more than capable of not only succeeding in whatever is on their resume,but as well as recognizing their potential.\nSoft skills aren't only valuable in landing a job, but also in maintaining success during employment.\nKeith Hjelmstad, president's professor at ASU's School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment, resonates with the sentiment that engineers are generally not equipped with soft skills.\n\"There's no reason (STEM related courses) can't also be good development of soft skills,\" Hjelmstad said, \"You have to know how to get along with people ... how to communicate, and most of what you do will be those things.\"\nHjelmstad has implemented soft skill workshops in his sophomore-level courses with the \"The Mechanics Project,\" a new approach to teaching engineering.\nThe project reformed engineering mechanics classes, such as Dynamics (CEE 212) and Statics (CEE 210), by introducing \"recitations\" that emphasize using a unique approach to typical problems.\nRecitations transform the way these courses are taught by usingactive engagement, allowing students to fundamentally understand complex concepts while encouragingsoft skills developmentthrough group work and question discussion.\nThese recitations also grant insight into exactly where students struggle by providing multiple ways to learn course material. Hjelmstad's aim was to transform the way engineers are taught these subjects — shifting it from pure calculations and brute memorization to forming a specific mindset about engineering.\nOutside the classroom, Edward Apraku, a senior studying civil engineering, said many of the soft skills he picked up came through community involvement.\n\"When you get closer to your junior and senior year and you work more in teams of engineers, which is awkward most of the time. Engineers are awkward,\" he said frankly. \"I think (Fulton's School of Engineering) could do a better job especially in freshman or sophomore year in teaching ... those soft skills.\"\nWhile ASU does provide undergraduate engineers withco-curricular courses to help develop soft skills, core courses should still teach aim to equip students with these skills — especially for freshmen.\nThese co-curricular courses encourage practical applications of engineering to community service or business endeavors and encourages student engineers to develop creative and entrepreneurial skills.\nBut most of those courses are optional. While labs and recitations can facilitate some development in teamwork and communication, the pandemic has put a damper on the waythose courses are normally done.\nSimilarly, non-core ASU graduation requirements like Global Awareness and Cultural Diversity in the U.S. can often be taken care of by freshman year, or even by courses prior to coming to ASU (like APs or IBs). Furthermore, while some high school students may have been taught certain soft skills in more challenging courses, those skillsdon't necessarily translate wellto a university-level education.\nIn a school withdegrees as diverseas those found at ASU, there should be a greater emphasis on soft skills in STEM beyond one-and-done electives.Humanities, in particular, could be the key to incorporating soft skills in STEM focused majors byencouraging creative thinking and critical analysis. These are the kind of sought-after skills found in any job market.\nPresently, STEM grads aren't getting these necessary skills despite increasing demand. If ASU has the resources to better equip their grads for the next wave of innovation, it ought to take advantage of them.\nReach the columnist atjkmiguel@asu.eduor follow@wolf1Ezon Twitter.\nEditor’s note: The opinions presented in this column are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its  editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
