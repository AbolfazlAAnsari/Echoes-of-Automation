            "inputText": "The importance of transparency in government is a concept familiar to most Stanford students. Yet until this week, a student seeking to discover what our 21st Undergraduate Senate had been up to would have encountered dead end after dead end. Prior to making a Freedom of Information request and beginning reporting for this piece, The Daily found that the last record of minutes from an Undergraduate Senate Meetingavailableon the Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) website was from March 6, 2018. Only five senators had their pictures and bios uploaded on the ASSU’s website. Andonly five senatorsprovided information for the Senate’s singular “Update Letter” this school year.\nSenator and Senate Director of Communications Mustafa Khan ’22 summed it up in an interview with The Daily: “The thing that has been really really shocking to me is that even now if you go to the Senate website, it’s not well-built in the sense that you can’t really figure out what’s happening.”\nThe website is in better shape now. Nine senators have their pictures uploaded, and the link to theSenate’s Google Drivefeatures updated minutes. But for a slate of candidates who promised transparency serving in a body whose constitution enshrines it, the 21st Undergraduate Senate has spent more than a quarter falling short of baseline standards of accountability and accessibility.\nTheASSU Constitutionmandates that “all minutes of meetings of Association legislative bodies … must be made available in electronic form within seven days of being approved.” Preceding her election as Senate Chair, Munira Alimire ’22promisedto reliably post these meeting minutes online. Prior to The Daily’s request for access to these minutes, the Google Drive folder was spotty, containing an incomplete record across fall and winter quarters.\nAlimire wasn’t the only senator to promise transparency. Sarah Saboorian’s ’22 platform suggested implementing ASSU Town Halls “in an effort to have greater transparency within the ASSU.” Anthony Duarte’s ’22 platform discussed “transparency between ASSU and the Student Body” and Martin Altenburg ’21 said that he was “passionate about … ASSU transparency,” adding that “transparency between the ASSU and the student body is important.”\nTransparency should not be a yearly platform promise. It should be a bottom-line requirement embedded and protected in the structure of the Senate.\nUndergraduate senators are “designated representatives for Stanford undergraduates” operating under the three general pillars of ASSU: advocacy, financial support and leadership. The Senate is the “representative to University administrators on hot button issues affecting the undergraduate community ranging from Title IX to sustainability.” Administrators are often heard lamenting how difficult it is to communicate with the student body; ASSU senators play an integral part in facilitating dialogue between students and key decision-makers. Moreover, the Senate finances over600 student groupswith approximately$2.5 million in funding.\nThe labyrinthine process required to find morsels of information available from the 21st Undergraduate Senate’s tenure online was enough to demoralize anyone from trying. Students should not be burdened with chasing down updates from their elected representatives; senators’ activities should be readily accessible for discussion and criticism among the student body. Because we are unsettled by this lack of transparency and accessibility, we make the following demands for this and all future Undergraduate Senates:\nThe Senate has made progress on numerous issues its members had set out to address: fromalleviating course feestomaking feminine hygiene products freein dorms to gathering support from various campus organizations toaddress cases of sexual violence. We think more people deserve to know.\nThis article has been corrected to reflect that Mustafa Khan’s title is Senate Director of Communications, not ASSU Director of Communications. The latter position represents the organization at large; Khan represents the Senate. The Daily regrets this error.\nContact the Volume 256 Editorial Board at opinions ‘at’ stanforddaily.com.\nEditorials represent the views of The Stanford Daily, an independent newspaper serving Stanford and the surrounding community.
