            "inputText": "ASU has gone through six name changes in its 137 year history, beginning as the Territorial Normal School in 1885.\nAt 5 p.m. outside of Old Main on ASU's Tempe campus, students can hear the school's symphonic bells chime the school hymn. When Mirabella resident David Mills first heard them, he started crying.\n\"I thought, 'Holy Toledo, yeah, I remember this!'\" Mills said. Like many residents, Mills was attracted to the University-based retirement community because it felt like coming home to the school he graduated from in 1963.\n\"How many students today know that the next (song) coming up is going to be the school hymn? What percentage, 10%? I have no idea. The online students wouldn't care at all,\" Mills said.\nWill today's students have the same connection that draws older alumni to Mirabella?\nNostalgia is a tough sell for a school so different than it was in 1963, or even since ASU President Michael Crow took over in 2002. Crow has demonstrated he can transform higher education by transforming ASU, and it's time the University embraces that by changing its name to reflect that transformation.\nIn 2002, state appropriations contributed almost 40% of the money coming into the University while its roughly 58,000 students contributed a little over 20% in tuition.\nToday, despite the Arizona constitution requiring that the University, like all public schools in the state, \"be as nearly free as possible,\" the Legislature contributes just 10%, while over 152,000 studentsnowpay half, equating $1.7 billion. The state refusing to pay leaves students responsible for covering the difference.\nTo Crow's credit, despite that disproportionate burden on students, the latest data shows enrollment has almost tripled during his tenure.In fact, there are over 61,000 online students this year alone.\nIt doesn't seem fair. The University's naming rights are worth far more than the state is paying. For instance, Don Mullett and his family have been honored with having their name on the new hockeyarenaafter a donation to the program thatequates to almost a quarter of the arena's cost.\nHear me out. Our school's name has a history of changing as the school redefines itself. In fact, ASU has gone throughsixname changes in its 137-year history, beginning as the Territorial Normal School in 1885. It was Tempe Normal School or Tempe State Teachers College until 1929, before expanding its boundaries by swapping out the city with the state. We weren't Arizona State University until a ballot initiative passed in 1958.\nWith a presence inCalifornia,Washington, D.C.andHawaii, it's factually incorrect to say the University is just an Arizona school, and if trends continue then online students will soon outnumber in-person students. The school that began as Territorial Normal School has once again grown beyond its boundaries, and tradition dictates we update our moniker.\nREAD MORE:ASU spent hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying California's State Legislature\nWith apologies to our neighbors to the north, the obvious choice would beNew American Universityin honor of Crow's vision.\nWhile I understand NAU may not be available, consider this: ASU enrollment is already more than half of the entire University of California system.That's UC Davis, UC San Francisco, UC Berkeley, UC Merced, UC Santa Cruz, UC Santa Barbara, UCLA, UC Riverside, UC Irvine, and UC San Diego – combined. Maybe we could catch up even more by just absorbing Northern Arizona altogether?\nDoubtful. Besides, since ASU already has signage on buildings in Arizona alone fromLake HavasutoMesait may be prudent to find a new name that keeps the initials. America's Scalable University? Closer, but there has to be a better fit.\nTo continue serving everyone in communities, universities must evolve.Panelists on Tuesday talked about creating life-long learners that will thrive in all educational pathways; highlights from the discussion can be found here:https://t.co/KTns0DruoBpic.twitter.com/qGG3Jv2siH\nOne of ASU's most successful growth mechanisms has been theStarbucks College Achievement Program.Forbes reportedin May that nearly 900 Starbucks employees graduated from ASU this past spring, and more than 20,000 Starbucks employees are currently participating.\nMaybe other corporations would be interested in partnering with ASU. Starbucks only has about 138,000 employees. That's fewer employees than ASU has students. Could you imagine a partnership with a larger company, say, one with 1.6 million employees? Maybe one that shares the values of innovation and scalability?\nPicture it. AMAZON STARBUCKS UNIVERSITY. It seems a fitting name for a University embracing a corporate growth mindset. Prime innovation to the last drop.\nIt may seem ridiculous at first, but providing access to affordable higher education is a serious matter. Even more so given the growing cost of education, along with the growing cost of pretty much everything else.\nTo be clear, in response to my inquiry, Veronica Sanchez, ASU's media relations and strategic communications director, said in an email \"there are no plans for a name change at ASU currently.\" But shouldn't there be?\nJust think what those companies, or others, might pay for the honor. I imagine Crow could negotiate far more than we're getting from the state. Then the University could once again uphold its constitutional duty.\nShould we start the bidding at $1.7 billion?\nEdited by Sadie Buggle, Piper Hansen and Kristen Apolline Castillo.\nReach the columnist atjdbrow52@asu.eduand follow@jamesbrownasuon Twitter.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
