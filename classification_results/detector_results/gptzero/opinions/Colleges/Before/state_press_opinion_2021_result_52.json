            "inputText": "\"Standardized testing puts more pressure on students and is not a reliable measure of intelligence, often having performance gaps between genders and race not reflected in class.\" Illustration published on Wednesday, Feb. 2, 2021.\nA majority of prospective college students today have had to take a standardized test, such as theSATorACTin order to get into college. It is seen as a rite of passage for a student in their junior year of high school to take one of these exams as away to measure their intelligence and determine their future.\nWith the pandemic, many universities haveopted out of requiringprospective students to take these exams and submit their scores. At ASU, onlyBarrett, the Honors Collegerequired score submission, but now they have also put the requirement on hold. Submitting ACT and SAT is optional for admission to ASU. Honestly, I hope that it stays this way.\nThe use of standardized testing became commonplace in 2002 after President George W. Bush’sNo Child Left Behind Act, which mandated annual testing across the nation. After Bush enacted the policy, average test scores declined even further, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics analyzed byBrittanica. These examshave been blamedas part of the reason why the U.S.’s rankings in math, science and readingslipped drasticallybetween 2000 and 2015.\nBecause of these exams, many teachers feel that they need toteach studentshow to take the SAT, rather thanteaching themin a way that they learn best. Because of this, the curriculum is becoming more monotonous and less creative andengaging to studentswho do not learn in the way that the College Board requires them to learn.\nStandardized testing is known to be discriminatory against students of certain backgrounds.\nAccording to Bradley Bostick, a professor at theMary Lou Fulton Teacher's College,some of the questions on these tests can include experiences that may not be familiar to students who are fromlow socioeconomic backgrounds.For example, in the 1980s, the SAT included a question where the correct answer included the word \"regatta,\" a type of sailboat. Sailing is an activity associated with the upper class, and many may have never heard of the word, according to theLA Times.\nStudents who are fromlower-class backgroundsdon'thave the same resources. They may not have wealthy parents who can send them to SAT prep courses or hire a private tutor for them. Some studentscannot even affordto take the exam multiple times, while other students may have the funds.\nThey do not necessarily measure how intelligent a student is; they measure how well they can take a test.\nThe exam also does not care if a student hastest-taking anxiety. Some students with mental health conditions orlearning disabilitiesmay still be highly intelligent. However, they may not be in the right headspace when taking this exam, especially if they were previously told that this exam was difficult or that they are not smart enough.\nThis exam can wreak havoc on a student's confidence. Students see their SAT or ACT score and feel that the number represents their self worth and their overall intelligence. For example, even though I did quite well in high school and graduated on the honor roll, I have test-taking anxiety anda disability, which did not translate well on my SAT and ACT scores. I was disappointed by my scores and even though I am now a successful college student, it still affects my self-esteem. While these exams do have accommodations forstudents with disabilities,lower-income studentsareless likelyto have access to the accommodations.\nThe exam has also been known to hold biases against girls, which Bostick said is his \"biggest problem.\"\nHe said that girls tend to score about 40% lower on the math portion of the exam. This gap does not align with how well female students fare in actual math courses, as they tend to get higher grades than male studentsin the classroom.\nReasons that female students tend to do worse on exams like the SAT include the fact that girls areoften toldthat they arenot as good at math. Girls also tend to be better course takers, while boystend to be better test-takers. Girls are more likely to overanalyze aclosed-ended question and do better onopen-ended questions, which the SAT does not provide.\nUnsurprisingly, these exams also hold aracial bias.Much of this bias istied to classism.Even though they are participating in these exams more,Black and Latinxstudents are still seeing a gap between their scores and the scores of their white counterparts. Additionally, the scores do not reflect thedecreasing performance gapbetween Black and white high school students. As mentioned earlier, the questions are written with awhite, middle-class studentin mind, so students who do not have the same experiences will do worse.\nAre GPAs more likely to predict a student's college performance than standardized testing scores? Somehigh performing countries,such as Finland, don't use standardized testing at all.\n\"It's less to do with this momentary snapshot in time of how you're doing on this one Saturday,\" Bostick said. \"It's a poor way to assess someone's ability to go to college and be successful.\"\nWithout standardized testing being a requirement this year, it has become clear that these tests are unneeded for college admission. They are archaic and prejudiced, and it is time that we retire them.\nReach the columnist athtenore@asu.eduor follow@haleyyhmton Twitter.\nEditor’s note: The opinions presented in this column are the author’s and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
