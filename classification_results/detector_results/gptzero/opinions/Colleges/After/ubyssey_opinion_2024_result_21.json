But Senate can often be hard to understand for the average student and theagenda docketcan be super long and dull to read.Senate Recentred is written by members of the Student Senate Caucus to demystify Senate by giving students a snapshot of what Senate is doing this month.\nHere’s what to expect at the February 21, 2024 Senate meeting.\nSenate is one of the bodies responsible for approving annual targets for student enrolment. Some highlights from last year’s Enrolment Report include:\nSenate willalsobe voting on the 2024-25 Enrolment Targets for the upcoming year. While individual faculties will be making different individual adjustments to their proposed intake of new undergraduate students, all in all, it will represent a 1.9per cent target increase for domestic students and a 3.2per cent decrease in international students compared to the previous academic year (2023-24).\nNew UBC programs and courses. Two brand new programs, as well as numerous courses, are up for Senate approval. A new Master's of Global Health is being proposed through the School of Population and Public Health and has support from industry professionals. This program will meetsincreasing demand in the public health sector and is the third of its kind nationwide.\nThe proposed Graduate Certificate in Migration Studies comes as a result of increased student demand and is targeted to graduate students interested in looking at mobilities and migration from an interdisciplinary perspective. The Faculty of Arts is also launching a new minor in Asian Language and Culture (Persian, Persianate and Iranian).\nSome interesting new courses include Topics in Indigenous Asia (ASIA 553), Applied Machine Learning for Construction and Facility Management (CIVL 427), Oceanic Geographies: Movement, Materiality, and Mobility (GEOG 492) and History Through Video Games (HIST 204).\nThe docket also includes a motion to approve new transcript designations for students for the 2024/25 academic year.\nSome examples include course in progress (CIP), transfer credit (TR), and no grade required (NGR). If approved, the full list of designations will be available on the academic calendar and on official student transcripts.\nThe next Senate meeting will be on March 20, 2024.\nIf you have questions for the Student Senate Caucus, you can email co-chairs Kareem Hassib atkareem.hassib@ubc.caand Kamil Kanji atvpacademic@ams.ubc.ca.\nShare this articlecopied!\nKareem Hassibauthor\nMathew Hoauthor\nKatherine Fengauthor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
