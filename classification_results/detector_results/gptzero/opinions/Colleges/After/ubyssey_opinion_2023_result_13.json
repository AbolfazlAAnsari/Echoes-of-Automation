If an agreement could not be reached, publishers could force mediation or arbitration.\nThe law doesn’t force Meta and Google to carry news content, though — and they've started to utilize their to not carry news in response to the law. This means news outlets, includingThe Ubyssey, aren’t accessible on Instagram or Facebook to some readers.\nBut remember, there are more ways to findThe Ubysseythan Instagram posts, Facebook links or even results on Google Search. Take control of where you get your information to avoid relying on search engines and social media channels whose primary goal is not to inform you — it’s to profit from your attention.\nNo matter what, visitingubyssey.cawill take you to our site. Add a bookmark to your browser or homepage to keep up with our reporting.\nReally Simple Syndication (RSS)readersaggregate posts from multiple sites into one place, like a personalized news inbox. Most web browsers allow you to add an RSS reader as an extension, but you can also download adesktop or mobile app. You can add us to your RSS feed withubyssey.ca/rss.\nIf you want a selection of UBC breaking news, profiles, satire and more delivered to your inbox, subscribe to our digital newsletter Dingbat Mailhere. It drops once a week during the school year.\nOr, if you love opening a physical newspaper, find a print copy ofThe Ubysseyon standsacross campus! Read it — then use it for a collage, to wrap a gift or as an informative piece of dorm decor.\nAnd we’re on social media too! So until we get blocked, you can find us on Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn — all @ubyssey.\nInformation technology companies have vast control over the information we access every day, creating situations like this one — where attempted policy interventions into the complicated political economy of journalism can result in suddenly cutting off Canadians from vital local news sources.\nSo whether it’sThe Ubyssey,The Vancouver SunorThe Globe and Mail, it’s more important than ever to find ways not controlled by Big Tech to access the information that’s important to you.\nWe’re lucky to have your support keeping us up and running regardless of the law's outcome. Nonetheless, we’re proud of our role in keeping our community informed and hope that you allow us to do so — by whatever means you choose.\nEditorials represent the opinions of the editorial board ofThe Ubyssey.\nShare this articlecopied!\nUbyssey Editorial Boardauthor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
