            "inputText": "Energy drink illustration by Seal Margalit.\nEnergy drinks have rapidly become more prevalent on college campuses. Since most students don’t get enough sleep, energy drinks offer consumers more caffeine so they can stay awake longer and be more alert. However, consistently drinking them can be extremely harmful.\nTheCenters for Disease Control and Preventiondefine an energy drink as “a beverage that typically contains large amounts of caffeine, added sugars, other additives, and legal stimulants such as guarana, taurine, and L-carnitine.” In 1997, Red Bull wasintroducedto the U.S., and since then, hundreds of other brands have been created and their primary market is college students.\nEnergy drinks are notregulatedas food but as supplements, so manufacturers can add more caffeine. TheFood and Drug Administrationsays 400mg of caffeine is the maximum amount a person should have daily without adverse health effects. But this is only for adults in pristine health and only for an occasional drink, not relying on them to make it through the day.\nFor context, a standard 12 oz.Red Bullhas about 114 mg, and a 16 oz greenMonsterhas 160mg. The energy drinks marketed as “healthy,” likeCelciusandAlani Nu, have 200mg in their 12 oz. cans.\nThe obsession with these drinks is prevalent throughout campus. I don’t think there’s been a day where I don’t see multiple people drinking them. All markets on campus sell them, and I have seen people giving them out at the UA Mall for free.\nNot only do energy drinks have a lot of caffeine, but their other ingredients are also unhealthy. They have a massive amount of sugar, and theAmerican Heart Associationrecommends 36g of sugar for men and 25g for women. A standardRed Bullhas about 38g, agreen Monsterhas 54g, and Celsius and Alani Nu drinks are “sugar-free” but containsucralose, an artificial sweetener.\nAnother thing taking over college campuses is the use of pre-workout. Like energy drinks, pre-workout offer a boost of energy to complete a workout. Most pre-workouts have the same ingredients as energy drinks, butsomecontain steroids banned by the NCAA.Mostpeople don’t need pre-workout because they can receive energy from a balanced diet.\nEnergy drinks should not be mixed with alcohol. Since energy drinks have loads of caffeine, they can conceal the depressive effects of alcohol, causing the consumer not to realize how much they have had until it’s too late.Four Lokoswere banned because they contained three stimulants, caffeine, taurine and guarana, and one depressant – alcohol, and they have since been rebranded only to contain caffeine and alcohol.\nDrinking many energy drinks per week can have awful side effects, especially on your heart. They cancauseheart palpitations, heart rhythm malfunctions and increased blood pressure and heart rate.\nIf minors drink energy drinks, there are even more ramifications, like insomnia, stunted growth andcardiovascular anomalies.Mostenergy drink companies have warnings on their websites saying their products are not recommended for children, but studies have shown that67%of adolescents have consumed energy drinks.\nThere aremanyother healthier ways to get caffeine, like green tea, black coffee and dark chocolate.\nI have fallen victim to consuming energy drinks a lot, especially during finals, to get an extra boost, but I try to stop myself because I have been addicted to them. They offer a temporary boost but can have lasting effects.\nFollow Kelly Marry onTwitter\n\n\nKelly Marry (she/her) is a sophomore studying journalism and public relations.
