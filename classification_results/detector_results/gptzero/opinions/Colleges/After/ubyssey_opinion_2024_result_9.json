            "inputText": "April 4, 2024\nWritten byTova Gaster\nTova Gaster is a fourth-year history and environmental geography student and the science editor forThe Ubyssey.\nIn March 2022, UBC and mining company Teck Resources Ltd. announced aresearch partnershipto install copper coatings on high-touch surfaces in applied science buildings. The project’s stated purpose is to reduce the spread of germs using copper’s antibacterial properties.\nWhile antibacterial copper hasuseful applicationsin high-health risk areas like hospitals, the project also gives Teck an opportunity to distract from recent headlines and clean up its public image, which has been tarnished by several high-profile human rights and environmental violations.\nAfter years of pollution from Teck coal mines, the trout population in BC’sElk Valley watershed— which is deeply important to the Ktunaxa First Nation — is nearing total collapse. An investigation by The Narwhal also revealed that Teck and the B.C. governmentlobbiedthe federal government against investigating Teck’s water pollution, which impacts watersafetyand public health on both sides of the Canada/United States border. In 2024, Tecksoldmost of the stake in the mines to another transnational mining company, leaving itunclearwho will clean up the mess.\nTeck also invests heavily inresearch,educationanddevelopmentat UBC.\nWhile the Copper and Health project is relatively innocuous on its own, it’s part of a disturbing trend: fossil fuel corporations like Teck donatehundreds of thousands of dollarsto UBC research and operations each year.\nUBC declared aclimate emergencyin 2020 but has so far failed to decisively interrogate its own relationships with the companies that drive it.\nTo address the climate crisis, we musttransitionaway from fossil fuels and towardsequitableanddemocraticrenewable energy systems. To do so requires eroding the social and economic power of the fossil fuel industry, which by nature will continue business as usual to maximize profit margins even as ecosystems collapse around us.\nWhen companies like Teck donate to institutions like UBC, they get a boost to their public images — and Teck has been upfront that the UBC Copper and Health project is a PR move. Its website states the project goals include “highlighting Teck’s involvement in creating safer public spaces.”\nAccording toresearchers, the Copper and Health project aims to decrease bacterial transmission in high-risk areas such as hospitals, where sterility can be the difference between life and death. This is an important mission.\nThe fact that Teck is leveraging its connections to UBC to explicitly brand itself as a public health hero should raise questions, especially when companies like Teck consistently act as thebiggest obstacles to climate action.\nTeck profits from mining fossil fuels and metals, including coal and bitumen. Its sectorpollutes waterways, destroys ecosystems andraises global temperaturesto increase the frequency and costs of devastating disasters each year.\nAccording to a2022 Health Canada report, the climate crisis represents a direct threat to health and wellness — risks which hurt BIPOC, disabled people and other marginalized communities more than others.\nWhile Teck is increasingly transitioning its dirty coal portfolio into copper mining— a key component of batteries for renewable energy storage — that transitionremains slow.\nIn recent years, Teck has begun to invest heavily in metals mining. It owns four major copper mines — a demonstrable incentive to position Teck Copper as a symbol for health and cleanliness, a more marketable narrative than its ongoing history of pollution and human rights violations.\nTeck’s copper mines have also been plagued by ecological and human rights issues. The Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project in Northern Chile was fined $1.2 million in 2019 for environmental violations, and in 2021 regulators served the company with eight differentenvironment-related legal charges. This followed years of condemnation for poor labour practices andlegal oppositionto the mine expansion from the Indigenous Ollagüe people, who assert they were not consulted in its approval process.\nThis is the same copper which coats UBC door handles in the name of public health.\nThe Copper and Health project is only the latest development in a long partnership between Teck and UBC. Beyond funding research, Teck was one of the major corporate donors to UBC’s 2008-2015 “Start an Evolution” fundraising campaign. It also funds scholarships, including the recently-announced $2M Don Lindsay Teck Award in Mining Engineering, designed to attract engineering students to the company.\nFormer Teck executives are also employed in high-level positions at UBC. They include a formerTeck vice presidentwho left the company to found theCanadian International Resources and Development Instituteat UBC, which provides research, training and ‘public administration reform’ to world governments on mining governance issues.\nMining research and policy impacts labour rights, Indigenous sovereignty and global environmental health. Research and policymaking around mining should not be left to those who stand directly to profit from it.\nThis is an opinion article.
