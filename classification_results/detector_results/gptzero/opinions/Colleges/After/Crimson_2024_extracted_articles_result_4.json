            "inputText": "Over the past two months, Congress has shown strong interest in intervening in Harvard’s governance. On Dec. 5, then-Harvard President Claudine Gaytestified beforethe House Committee on Education and the Workforce about the University’s efforts to address alleged antisemitism on campus. Later, the Housepassed a resolutioncondemning her responses to a line of questioning about what speech may violate Harvard’s conduct policies.\r\nThen, the committeebegan investigatingallegations of plagiarism against the former president. The committee’s chair, Rep. Virginia A. Foxx (R-N.C.),requested a sweeping collectionof materials, including “any non-public guidelines or policies” about plagiarism and potentially sensitive information about students and faculty disciplined for academic integrity violations.\r\nFollowing Gay’s resignation, Foxxgave Harvard two weeksto produce what could amount to thousands of documents about alleged antisemitism; Jewish enrollment; foreign donations; diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives; student and employee discipline; and internal communications between Havard’s leaders.\r\nThis pattern of congressional interest in Harvard is hardly new. Over the summer, after Harvard lost its affirmative actionSupreme Court case, barring it from practicing race-conscious admissions, U.S. Senator J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) wrote to all Ivy League schools asserting that their reactions to the Court’s ruling may be unlawful. He threatened Senate investigations and demanded answers to several questions about their new admissions processes.\r\nBut that’s not all. The Department of Education isinvestigating Harvard’s useof legacy and donor admissions preferences to determine whether they racially discriminate. The Department is alsoinvestigating Harvard’s responseto alleged antisemitic harassment to determine whether the University discriminated against Jewish students.\r\nWhat do all these interventions have in common?\r\nIn each instance, Harvard’s federal funding has been the government’s leverage.\r\nThe Constitution does not give Congress unconditional authority to regulate private universities. That’s why many laws that regulate universities apply only to schools that accept federal funds — includingTitle VIof the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the basis of Harvard’s affirmative action case.\r\nMoreover, Congress can threaten to revoke its funding to motivate universities to take actions that are not legally required, such as complying with requests to provide documents.\r\nReasonable people can disagree about how Harvard should govern itself. But I believe that many more people can unite behind the idea that preserving universities’ independence from government control is key to maintaining a healthy education system in a robust democracy.\r\nThat’s why Harvard should give up its federal dollars.\r\nAccording to Harvard’smost recent financial report, federal funds account for about an eighth of the University’s revenue, and this comprises 66 percent of Harvard’s research funding. A much smaller piece of federal funding supports financial aid — less than six percent of Harvard students’ aid.\r\nThus, forgoing federal funds would not come without costs. Harvard would have to scale back some research projects. But the costs are likely to be smaller than one might think. Harvard could direct funds to its most promising projects, and in the past, it has successfully replaced federal funding through private sources.\r\nIn 2001, when then-President George W. Bush severely limited federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research, Harvard researcher Douglas A. Meltonsecured private fundingto continue that research.\r\nHarvard is probably the best-positioned university in the country to eschew federal financing.At nearly $51 billion, its endowment value is the largest for any university endowment in the country. Moreover, Harvard receives the most private donations of any American university – nearly $1.4 billion last year.\r\nDebates about how Harvard should operate will continue — but they are made far more polarizing when the federal government is involved. Without federal funding, Harvard would be free to craft its own policies concerning free speech, admissions, and other issues, regardless of loud critics. But these critics could not say that their tax dollars are supporting those practices.\r\nPolitical polarization is tightening its grip on Harvard, but the University is not helpless. It’s time for Harvard to free itself from ballooning congressional intervention by ditching federal funds.\r\nJacob P. Winter ’24 is an Economics concentrator in Leverett House."
