            "inputText": "The Stanford Management Company manages the fourth largest universityendowmentin the nation at $36.5 billion. TheStatement on Divestment, which calls for Stanford to divest from Chevron, Lockheed Martin and other companies tied to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, was recentlypassedin Stanford’s 2024 ASSU election. This bill, coupled with campaigns for Stanford to divest from thefossilfuelindustry, highlight that the investment of our endowment is under more scrutiny than ever.\nQuestions over the ethics and responsibility of the University’s investments are handled by the Board of Trustees’ Special Committee on Investment Responsibility (SCIR), whichsteersStanford’s investment decisions. This committee currently features no student members.\nWe believe that the inclusion of student representatives has long been needed, independent of current movements. The Board of Trustees haseleven committeesthat make recommendations to and advise the Board on various aspects of the University’s operations. Currently, two student representatives serve as “full, voting members” on four of these committees: namely, Development, Finance, Land & Buildings, and Student, Alumni, & External Affairs. Student members on the Finance Committee already oversee fiscal matters similar to those SCIR deals with.\nWe call upon The Board of Trustees to introduce two student seats on the SCIR to officially include students in discourse and decision-making concerning Stanford’s endowment.\nThe case for student representation on SCIR\nStudents offer a different perspective than current seated stakeholders on how institutional responsibility should motivate investment decisions. Having student members on the committee would foster more direct and effective representation of the diversity and conviction of student views, removing the kinds of bureaucratic red tape that isolates decisionmakers from our voices. Student members could serve as spokespeople who listen to, summarize and report on student concerns, rather than leaving it up to the Board of Trustees to speculate on campus sentiments.\nOur argument for student input is separate from particular activist causes or advocacy. Rather, it is rooted in the need for an active and official student partnership with the Trustees overourUniversity’s institutional holdings.\nStanford’s investment portfolio, or the “Merged Pool” controlled by the Stanford Management Company, is money that is invested in the name of our education. Many current students will become alumni who endow gifts that are managed as part of this portfolio. Representation on the Investment Committee would cultivate the financial partnership between Stanford and future alumni from an early stage. It will also foster greater trust and transparency between current students and administrators.\nWith these benefits in mind, why are students not already represented on the Special Committee on Investment Responsibility?\nIf top Stanford leaders believe students are not experienced or knowledgeable enough about finance and investing, this conflicts with the fact that students are already represented on theFinance Committee. Moreover, the student body at large has earned the confidence of the University to take onloans for their education.\nIf Stanford does not wish to disclose its investments to members of the student body, we do not think this is a sufficient reason to preclude student representatives. Stanford students already work as summer analysts at theStanford Management Company.\nIf Stanford believes students are incapable of putting the good of the University before advancing their personal politics, then maybe they should have not trusted students to serve on thePresidential Search Committeein the first place – a committee with a similarly significant task.\nA brief history of student-led investment decisions at Stanford\nStanford students have longdemonstratedthe desire to discuss and revise institutional holdings. In 1985, the student bodyvoted 2,045 to 485that Stanford should divest from Motorola due to Motorola’s sales to South African military and law enforcement. Stanford’s Trustees voted in agreement with students’ recommendation, committing todrop its nearly $4.7 million worth of Motorola stockif Motorola continued business operations with the regime. This culminated in Motorolasellingall manufacturing operations in South Africa.\nIn 2005, the Stanford chapter of “Students Taking Action Now: Darfur” (STAND)pushedStanford to divest from four companies whose business operations supported the Sudanese regime that perpetuated genocides in Darfur.\nIn 2014, the Board of Trustees announced that the Stanford endowment wouldno longer fund coal mining companies, making Stanford the first major university in the nation to take any such action. The Board Chair at the time described Fossil Free Stanford, the student coalition behind much of the advocacy at the time, as having “catalyzed important discussion” about investments made by the University.\nIn all of these cases, the Board ended up revising institutional holdings due to student perspectives. It’s time to institutionalize the partnership between students and the Board of Trustees. Formal seating of students on the Investment Responsibility Committee would provide stability to the tumult that exists on all sides of difficult investment discussions.\nA seat at the table\nSince the Board’s 2018adoptionof itsStatementon Investment Responsibility and Ethical Investment, the school has witnessedintense student advocacyfor divestment including ASSU ballot initiatives andpetitionsto faculty and the Board of Trustees.\nTo be clear: we are not arguing that students alone should drive Stanford’s portfolio. Rather, we are simply asking for students to be respected enough to have a seat at the table when discussing whether the endowment gets spent in line with the values Stanford claims to stand for. This includes “environmental, social and governance factors,”accordingto the Committee’s statement of values.\nWe propose that students should have two seats — one undergraduate, one graduate — on the Special Committee on Investment Responsibility. This selection process should be rigorous, credential-based and should start as soon as possible.\nAn ideal candidate for the committee would have an extensive background in finance and investing, the ability to communicate the diverse interests and needs of the student body and, most importantly, demonstrate the shared values our community embodies.\nIf the University commits to this increased transparency, the Board of Trustees will gain invaluable insights into student perspectives, while students will gain long-awaited involvement in critical decision-making related to Stanford institutional holdings. Aligned investing is difficult — more accountability can only help.\nThe Stanford Daily Editorial Board comprises Opinions Editors, Columnists, and at least one member of the Stanford Community.
