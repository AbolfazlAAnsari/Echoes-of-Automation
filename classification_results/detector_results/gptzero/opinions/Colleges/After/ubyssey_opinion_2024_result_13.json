But, Senate can often be hard to understand for the average student and theagenda docketcan be super long and dull to read.\nSenate Recentred is written by members of the Student Senate Caucus to demystify Senate by giving students a snapshot of what Senate is doing this month.\nHere’s what to expect at the March 20 Senate meeting.\nThe Senate will also receive Student Experience of Instruction (SEI) reports for the 2021 and 2022 Winter Sessions. The SEI’s ask students to assess their course instructors on various metrics (did the instructor give clear instructions, provide useful feedback, show genuine interest, etc). A key finding was that the rates of students filling out SEI’s has been gradually declining. In 2020, 51 per cent of surveys met therecommended minimum responserate in Term 1, and 40 per cent did so in Term 2.\nIn 2021, these numbers fell to 46 per cent (T1) and 38 percent (T2), and in 2022, the response rates were 44 per cent  (T1) and 35 per cent (T2). Another observed trend is that average scores given to Instructors have been increasing. Potential reasons for these trends are the move back to in-person classes after the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as changes in wording of the questions asked.\nMoving forward, the university aims to improve response rates by sending out more email reminders and encouraging instructors to give students class time to complete the SEI survey.\nLast year, Senate approved a request from UBC Ceremonies and Events allowing students to adorn their graduation caps to reflect their Indigenous identity. At this month’s meeting, Senate will vote to permanently allow the practice.\nFollowing a recommendation from the UBC Senate triennial reviews, external consultants conducted a review of the UBC Vancouver Senate.\nUp for approval of the review report at the upcoming Senate meeting, this review encompasses a comprehensive assessment of the Senate's governance and operations.\nThe review's Terms of Reference encompasses ten key requirements addressing opportunities to enhance the effectiveness of the Senate. Its findings and recommendations are anticipated to spark insightful discussions among Senators as the Senate collectively assesses ways to enhance the Senate's effectiveness and uphold its commitment to academic governance.\nA partnership agreement regarding the Climate Adaption, Resilience, and Empowerment (CARE) Program is up for approval.\nUnder this agreement, UBC along with Sciences Po, the University of Guelph, and the University of Toronto will receive a multi-year grant of around $10 million to enable exchange and academic opportunities in developing leadership addressing the climate crisis.\nStudents of the UBC School of Public Policy and Global Affairs will be able to access the CARE programme through its four components: scholarships and fellowships, remote student activities, in-situ student projects, and advocacy.\nNext month’s Senate meeting will be on April 17, 2024.\nIf you have questions for the Student Senate Caucus, you can email co-chairs Kareem Hassib atkareem.hassib@ubc.caand Kamil Kanji atvpacademic@ams.ubc.ca.\nShare this articlecopied!\nKatherine Fengauthor\nMathew Hoauthor\nSultana Raziaauthor\nKareem Hassibauthor\nTamia Shenillustrator\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
