            "inputText": "Content warning: This article contains references to eating disorders.\nI am concerned about the downsizing of plates in the dining hall. As someone who has struggled with an eating disorder and has many friends who have struggled with eating disorders on this campus, interventions like these make recovery harder. This kind of behavioral nudge presents a serious community health issue.\nThe new dining hall plates this year are tiny. They have an eight-inch diameter, compared to standard dinner plates that have 10-inch or 11-inch diameters. This means that the new plates have about 60% of the area of a standard plate.\nPeople eat less food when provided with smaller plates. One study published in the Food Quality and Preference Journalaskedparticipants to draw the amount of food they expected to eat for dinner on two different plate sizes. On average, they drew 24% more food on larger plates.\nThese results have been corroborated time and time again. Another studypublishedin the American Journal of Preventative Medicine found thatnutrition expertsgiven larger bowls served themselves 31% more ice cream. As Bryan Wansink, professor of consumer behavior at Cornell,wrote, plate size “can subtly suggest how much food is reasonable, normal, typical and appropriate for us to be serving ourselves and consuming.”\nThis perception leaves people thinking they have eaten enough food, or even too much food, when they haven’t. For this reason, “use smaller plates” iscommondieting advice.\nThe amount of food that can fit on the new dining hall plates is not enough for a meal for me — a semi-active, five-foot-four woman with a medium metabolism. This amount of food is also not enough for many of my friends, with one exclaiming, “Oh! That’s why I’m so hungry,” an hour after dinner when I brought up the small plates.\nThe default meal plan amounts to around two swipes per day, and there is little to no access to free food between meals for most students on campus, so not eating enough at one meal affects students throughout the day.\nAn obvious workaround would be for students to take multiple plates if they need more food. However, people struggling with restrictive eating disorders likely will stop themselves from getting another plate, thinking that needing more than one plate worth of food means they have failed, makes them fat or means they are overeating (this is an eating disorder recovery blogpostreframing getting seconds).\nEven for people without formally diagnosed eating disorders, there is a stigma associated with getting seconds or taking multiple plates of food.\nEating disorders are commonplace among college students. Between 10 and 20% of women and 4 to 10% of men in college currentlysufferfrom an eating disorder, according to the Child Mind Institute. Residential & Dining Enterprises (R&DE) should be taking steps to ameliorate this alarming prevalence, especially because eating disorders have thehighest mortality rateof all psychological conditions. With the known ubiquity of disordered eating on this campus, Stanford Dining has no excuse for forcing the student body to follow dieting advice.\nIn addition to harming students who struggle with disordered eating, small plates can aggravate other existing problems.\nI am sure that this change was instituted with good intentions, maybe as a food waste prevention program or to save costs on food in the dining halls. While it can be argued that portion control is an important life skill, I firmly believe that protecting college students who are particularly vulnerable to disordered eating is more important. And there are other ways to prevent food waste that don’t result in hungry students struggling with whether to go back for seconds.\nI don’t know all of the solutions, but intentionally restrictive plates are not a viable option.\nEliana Fuchs wrote this article.\nCameron Lange, Vai Crevoisier and Elena Sierra contributed to this article.\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and  letters to the editor.
