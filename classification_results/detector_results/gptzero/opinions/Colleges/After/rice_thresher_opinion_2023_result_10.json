The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors.\nWe have lost sight of the bigger picture in the Middle East.Intensificationofviolenceover the precedingmonthhas shattered the veneer of aninternationalrules-basedorder, promulgating the precariousness of ascertaining globalprosperity,stabilityandpeacethroughsui generismultilateral frameworksdevisedtoavertthe perpetuation of such hostilities. Notably, the conflict haslaid barethealarmingmoralcalculusprecludingmeaningfuldiscourseacrossAmerica’scollegecampuses,includingourown.\nOn Oct. 7, Israeli authorities reported an incursion of Hamasmilitantsinto Southern Israel. Theunanticipatedattack led to the demise ofover1,200 people — the deadliest massacre of Jews since theHolocaust. Hamas has attractedinternationalcondemnation for orchestrating an attack characterized ascrimes against humanity,war crimesand itsheinousexpressionofgenocidal intenttodestroythenation-stateofIsrael.\nAt present, over two hundredcaptives, including Israelicivilians, are reportedly held in Gaza. Inresponse, Israel has enforced a “total blockade” on the Hamas-run Gaza Strip,issuedevacuation orders in northern Gaza, andtakenotheractions, raising questions about their legality and impact at every level ofgovernance,securityandpublic order. While Israel asserts itsright to self-defenseandeffective sovereigntyover the Occupied Palestinian Territories under customary internationallaw, it must also balance this withjus in belloprinciples. Theextentandimplicationsof Israel's occupation in Gaza, which is seeing thedeadliestconflict of the five since 2006, remaindisputed.\nAt present, humanity finds itself at the profound crossroads of anunprecedentedhumanitarian catastrophe. Despite this, it seems we are preoccupied with futile discourse about “who” or “what” to condemn, which has precipitated the current-day reality wherethousands of innocent civilianshave been intolerably killed with “no ceasefire in sight.” As entire populations arebesieged and under attack, denied access toessentialsforsurvivaland asymmetrically targeted in theirhomes, shelters, hospitalsand places of worship (kibbutzimandmosquesalike), we must recognize the plight unfolding in the Middle East as an outcome of collectivepoliticalandmoralfailure.\nAmid this intractable landscape, we, as members of the Rice community, must feel compelled to ask ourselves: In seeking to mitigate regional anguish, areretributiveorreconciliatorymeans ofresolutionmore desirable?Does it matter?\nAs people of conscience, we must critically evaluate whether thepursuit of retributionand thesuppression of dissentperpetuate thede factocycle of violence. Instead, we must consider the adoption of non-violentmeansto attaindesirableoutcomes that acquiesce to thesupremacy of human rights. This shift only amplifies the need toneutralizeperformative tactics ofcensorshipanddeceit, and embrace a collective stand to the antagonistic forces ofantisemitismandanti-Muslimbigotry. Only in doing so can we restrain the generational pandemic of inhumanity from within the hedges.\nLet me reiterate whom I implicate: the egregiously partial media, public figures and political constituents who are culpable through inaction. Destabilizingrhetoricpredicated on prejudice, intolerance and sectarianism must be unequivocally repudiated; conversely, we should refrain from inadvertently conflating such acts as an implicit endorsement of retaliatory violence. Within the Rice community, the challenge to foster productive dialogue in the public arena that can withstand the weight of contention and complexity stands. This necessitates incorporating diverse perspectives in academic discourse and facilitating forums for civil debate to encourage critical yet empathetic engagement to resist interpreting the anguish of war asfait accompli. Recognizing that our tendency towardpolarizationis often innatelyemotionalin nature, our primary defense today lies in our willpower. We must extricate ourselves from the devices of division in pursuit of embracing a common humanity.\nRelinquishing the superficial divisions imposed upon our societies, we must learn not just to avoid hate, but to ascertainconsensus ad idem— that you are not the “others” enemy, nor are they yours. The fabric of unity and civil discourse is fractured when emotional vulnerabilities triumph rationality. This serves only our adversaries, newly enabled and emboldened, who prioritize scapegoating and xenophobia.\nNow, for the sake of humanity, we must condemn war’s explicit apologists as well as their latent conspirators in this country. It is imperative to stand united with all innocent victims of indiscriminate violence. Most importantly, we cannot afford to allow globalwelfareto suffer the consequences of our own inaction, in a world wherede factochecks and balances on violence are often subverted to notions of political and personal expediency.\nIt is my sincerest hope that the Rice community can transcend the limitations of hatred and emerge united on the side of humanity. Let us be among those who cooperate for the betterment of the world and not its destruction.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
