The student body’s dissatisfaction with the SA has been clear, with many even calling for change in the way the SA operates, or questioning the allocation of theircurrent resources elsewhere. If you’re one of the many jaded about the SA, we pose a question: Why not run for SA yourself?\nDespite sometimes common belief, the SA has, in past and recent years, done actual, important work for the student body. Many of the resolutions the SA has passed have been unanimous and contributed greatly to improvement of student life. In November 2023, theyallocated $2,000to the Student Success Initiative’s pantry. In 2020, SA leaders helpedinitiate the servery meal swipe donation program, which has now grown to provide over8,000 meal swipes to students. Theyintroduced the munch meal period and expanded dining hoursacross the serveries.\nThe SA has even passed resolutions on more controversial — but pressing — topics. On Dec. 4, 2023,a resolution was passedaffirming support for the Rice University Faculty Statement of Solidarity with Palestinians. In March 2022, the SA passed a resolutiondenouncing the statementsof Rice swim coach Seth Huston regarding the participation of transgender students in college-level sports. And, in November 2021, it was SA that lobbied torelocate the Founder’s Memorialin the academic quad, contributing to thestatue’s ultimate removal. Regardless of whether you agree with some of these resolutions, their importance is obvious — they give students a voice. Use yours, too.\nWe also want to commend Solomon Ni, who announced his resignation as SA president on Jan. 22. During Ni’s time as SA treasurer, he was vital in drafting a resolution to make the2024 Election Day non-instructional, which was eventually passed by the Faculty Senate. They helpedimplement changes to the Survey of All Studentsto gather student feedback on off-campus housing and personal finance and completely rebranded the SA. Despite Ni’s resignation, we believe his tenure is a testament to changes students are capable of making.\nThere’s also been a significant amount of student activism on campus the past few years.We’ve found that it kind of works. At the core of many of these moves in activism is the SA and the passionate student leaders that participate in the organization. This coming year is a chance to keep that momentum going — but only if the student body cares.\nOnce upon a time, we did. Elections used to be far more contested than they are now — and contested elections will be key in getting more students attentive to this election cycle. There even used to bedrama within SA elections. Maybe it’s time we bring that back.\nWhile the SA doesn’t always make decisions the entire student body can agree with, they do always make decisions. If you want to be a part of making this difference, or even stop other people from making a difference, consider running for SA this year.\nEditor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Prayag Gordy, Riya Misra, Nayeli Shad, Brandon Chen, Sammy Baek, Sarah Knowlton, Hadley Medlock and Pavithr Goli. ​​Editor-in-Chief Prayag Gordy recused himself from this editorial due to reporting  on the 2024 SA elections in our news section.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
