            "inputText": "A decision from the Arizona Court of Appeals represents a win for all local businesses near ASU.\nLast month, the Arizona Court of Appeals lifted the injunction on thecase between Shady Park and Mirabella at ASUin Shady Park‚Äôs favor.\nThe injunction placed heavy restrictions on the club regarding hosting live music events, citing chiefly First Amendment concerns among others. Court documents from the Arizona Court of Appeals stated that the injunction ‚Äúburdens more speech than necessary to address the asserted harm.‚Äù\nThe Arizona Court of Appeals has ruled in our favor. Please read our statement for information on the trial and for what's next regarding our fight to bring the music back ü¶ö Check out the link in our bio for the complete ruling and relevant articles#SaveShadyParkpic.twitter.com/FaKzMahwCa\nThis inevitable decision seems obvious in light of the initial complaint. Unlike what was issued in the injunction, even Mirabella never asked for a curfew on concerts. The injunction was unnecessarily heavy-handed even when looked at from Mirabella‚Äôs perspective. According to the appeal, even Mirabella‚Äôs own expert testified in the initial trial that just turning the volume down to 65 decibels would help surrounding residents.\nIssuing a curfew that effectively kills all nighttime shows is absurd, and this injunction was rightfully vacated and remanded. Hopefully, this case can serve as a lesson for the courts to consider less heavy-handed rulings, thinking them through rather than just going for what is seemingly the easiest approach.\nBut furthermore, this case serves as a lesson for ASU; the University needs to use more foresight in its future investments.\nIf anything, Mirabella is a clear-cut example of a lack of foresight. Putting a retirement community in the middle ofTempeand then expecting peace and quiet is ridiculous, and nowthe studentsare footing the bill for ASU‚Äôs lack of foresight and common sense ‚Äì again, who thought thatMill Avenuewould be the ideal spot for a tranquil retirement community?\nASU should not be making blunders like Mirabella, especiallyin light of the expansions the University is making into other statesand just how much these expansions cost the school. Again, it‚Äôs important to remember that students foot the bill for these mistakes at the end of the day through tuition. Also, and more importantly, they pay through sacrificing the student experiences that come with living on or near campus ‚Äì student experiences that ASU is supposed to be keeping in its best interests.\nImagine if ASU had chosen a different location with cheaper real estate and a quieter surrounding area to put their retirement community in. Imagine what that money savedcould have been spent on, like finding solutions tothe housing crisis that ASU is currently facingor other things that would directly benefit the vast majority of students‚Äô experiences at the University.\nIn addition, situations like Mirabella's do not look good when the school is making incredibly costly investments in other areas.If ASU is going to be spendinghundreds of thousands of dollars on lobbyingin order to get the funds needed to expand into other areas, they need to show that they can be trusted to think ahead about where they want to expand and what exactly they are trying to create in these areas.\nBlunders like Mirabella don‚Äôt just hurt ASU as a school, they hurt ASU‚Äôs student body, taking away experiences that could greatly benefit the vast majority of students. If ASU wants to continue to expand into new areas and break new ground, I hope those in charge will view Mirabella as a lesson and use more forethought in these future developments. They should keep in mindwho,at the end of the day, is paying the bill for the new developments, ormistakes, that ASU may make.\nEdited by Kate Duffy, Jasmine Kabiri and Caera Learmonth.\nReach the columnist atswmcgee@asu.eduand follow@swmcgeemediaon Twitter.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
