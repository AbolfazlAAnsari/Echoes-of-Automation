Upon entry, students would discover that the historically packed public boasted the attendance of, well, a large FITQ.\nThis shift arrives in light of new capacity limitations and a closed sundeck,recommendedby the Alcohol Policy Advisory Committee. As we await the last public of the year, capacity policies for Bacchanalia should return to a reasonable medium.\nThe stringent Martel capacity limit, which required checking each student’s net ID against a massive spreadsheet of ticketed students, was an administrative overstep that harmed Rice’s beloved student self-governance and traditions. This year’s Beer Bike was relatively controlled, likely pointing to efforts on the part of college leadership to encourage safe drinking practices and students for monitoring their own drinking. Fun yet responsible publics exemplify Rice’s high degree of student autonomy and traditions, which remain a key selling point for potential students. We hope administration can respond in kind with more reasonable policies for Bacchanalia and upcoming years, preserving these traditions that make Rice, Rice.\nThe ticketing process of Martel’s morning party, which has been the same used for many post-COVID publics, is inefficient and unnecessarily burdensome for volunteers. Instead, as we’ve advocated for in the past,let students show upand close entrance to the public once capacity is reached, removing the need to note down individual net IDs and deal with thousand-row spreadsheets crashing. Believe it or not, there was a time before Google Form ticket drops and freshmen reselling wristbands for 10 times their original cost.\nComing off a five-month dry spell of publics, we understand the need to monitor Beer Bike more strictly this year. But by no means should the success of this year’s Beer Bike imply that overly stringent ticketing and net ID checks are the correct path. If Martel’s morning party was just a test, we hate to see what’s next.\nLast year, our editors-in-chiefvoiced their concernsabout the slow death of campus traditions. Their sentiment still rings true. We’ve had our slap on the wrist — now, we ask that Rice traditions aren’t sacrificed in the name of overdone safety procedures.\nEditor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Riya Misra, Spring Chenjp, Maria Morkas, Prayag Gordy, Sarah Knowlton, Sammy Baek, Shruti Patankar, Juliana Lightsey, Arman Saxena and Kathleen Ortiz.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
