But, Senate can often be hard to understand for the average student and theagenda docketcan be super long and dull to read.\nSenate Recentredis written by members of the Student Senate Caucus to demystify Senate by giving students a snapshot of what Senate is doing this month.\nHere’s what to expect at theJanuary 18Senate meeting.\nUBC’s unclassified students program (UNCL) allows people with previous degrees to take UBC undergraduate and graduate level courses without the intention of applying the credit toward a degree program.\nThe proposed revisions will require UNCL students to maintain a sessional average of 50 per cent per winter session to be eligible to continue and will take effect for 2023 winter session.\nThese revisions are to keep consistency with faculty requirements of being eligible to continue taking classes, since UNCL has no failed year policy.\nRevisions have been made to the grading system for the branch of global surgical care, housed within the department of surgery. This program offers the Graduate Certificate and Master in Global Surgical Care (MGSC).\nThese changes will implement a flexible grading system (pass/fail grading system) with a 74 per cent average being required to continue the program and for new students entering the program in 2023 winter session or later.\nThe Doctor of Medicine (MD) Undergraduate Program will expand the enrolment limit from 288 to 306 in the 2023 winter session, and from 306 to 328 in the 2024 winter session and onwards due to its revised enrolment targets.\nUBC Vancouver will add 16 new positions, rolled out over 2 years as follows:\nAcademic Term dates are being approved at Senate today.
