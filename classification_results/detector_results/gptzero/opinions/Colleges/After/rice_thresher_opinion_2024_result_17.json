Stallings’ headlining proposal is to consider raising the Blanket Tax, a fee on student tuition that supports student groups.\nSome nine organizations, including the Thresher, Rice Program Council, University Court and the SA itself, negotiate annual budgets with the Blanket Tax Committee, which the SA treasurer runs. Other student clubs can request one-time allotments through the Blanket Tax Committee’s Initiative Fund for new events.\nThe Blanket Tax is written into the SA constitution and has been set at $85 since 2015.Adjusting for inflation, $85 today would have been just $64.41 nine years ago — a decrease of nearly a quarter of its real value. At the same time, the inflation-adjusted undergraduate tuition has increased from $41,560 in2015-16to $47,643.59 (in 2015 terms) for students matriculating in 2024-25.\nStallings said he wants to explore raising Blanket Tax as an option to continue supporting Blanket Tax Organizations, which have operated with a budget that is essentially shrinking. We support this exploration. We are mindful of yet another increase to student tuition, and we encourage the Blanket Tax Committee to find ways to realign spending, but it goes without saying that student organizations have less money per student today than nine years ago. Countless student organizations rely on Blanket Tax and Initiative Fund money for informative, fun and widely attended events, yet we’re running low on cash.\nAnother key part of Kim’s platform which Stallings reiterates is increasing the number of Blanket Tax Organizations, with a focus on Rice PRIDE. While Stallings acknowledges budget limitations in how many organizations can have Blanket Tax status, he told us he hopes to focus on groups with far-reaching and inclusive impacts on large parts of the student body. We support directing SA funding toward this goal, though we don’t know if Blanket Tax status is the best way to achieve it. Regardless, it requires a comprehensive look at funding, and we believe Stallings is the best person for the job.\nStallings’ opponent, Thomas Ngo, a current new student representative for McMurtry College, possesses a good vision for the role, but we are not sure he has amassed enough experience to become the treasurer. In an interview with the Editorial Board, Ngo rightly said that international students like himself bring a different and important perspective to finance. We hope that Ngo, who joined the Blanket Tax Committee earlier this semester, can remain a valuable voice at the table.\nEditor’s Note: Features editor Sarah Knowlton and Arts and Entertainment editor Hadley Medlock recused themselves from this editorial due to close personal relationships with one of the candidates.\nEditor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Prayag Gordy, Riya Misra, Nayeli Shad, Brandon Chen, Sammy Baek, Sarah Knowlton, Hadley Medlock and Pavithr Goli.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
