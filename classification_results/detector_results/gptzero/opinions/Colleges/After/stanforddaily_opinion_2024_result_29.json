            "inputText": "As a diverse group of Stanford alumni, many of us have been involved with the Palestine solidarity movement long enough to remember when it was an embattled, minorityposition. We are heartened to see the tradition of resisting injustice at Stanford continue during a time when Israel’s enterprise ofoccupation,ethnic cleansingandapartheidhas never been more brazen.\nMany of us have continued the advocacy that began on campus when we were students. Whether it was Students Confronting Apartheid in Israel (SCAI), Coalition for Justice in the Middle East (CJME), Stanford University Students for UNICEF (SUSU) orStanford Out of Occupied Palestine (SOOP), Stanford is a place where alumni who have become international leaders first developed and solidified their social justice advocacy. Conversations with peers in the classroom, around our dorms and across shared meals transformed us and shaped our ethical frameworks. Our opinions changed, our perspective broadened and our empathy deepened precisely because of the kinds of conversations that are taking place every day at the sit-in.\nWe, the undersigned, are bound together by an understanding that the historic injustices of the 20th and 21st centuries were often dismantled because college students throughout the world chose to stand against them. Werecognizethat the Stanford Sit-In to Stop Genocide strengthens the tide of history, which is turning against Israel’s cruel and inhumane systems of oppression. Past protests of this nature, such as Stanford Out of South Africa (1985) and the Hunger Strike for Low Wage Workers (1994), have beenpivotalin shaping Stanford into a more just institution, and the present sit-in furthers that legacy.\nWe lend our voices and support to the students in White Plaza who are playing a vital role in refusing to allow the public to look away asgenocidetakes place with the tacit complicity of Stanford’s endowment. Many alumni in this collective, some of whom are parents or siblings of participating students, have visited the sit-in, met with administrators to ensure the protestors’ safety, battled misinformation campaigns targeted toward participating students and insisted on the continued protection of free speech and the right to protest.\nLike many current Stanford students, we as alumni have been tremendously affected by the genocide in Gaza, as well as theongoingraids,extrajudicial murdersandkidnappingsin the occupied West Bank. Most tragically, Dr. Rajaie Batniji ’03 M.A. ’03, a former class president, has had over 60 members of his family — men, women and children — murdered by the Israeli military in Gaza over the past three months. Dr. Sammy Abusrur’s ’09 first cousin, Anas Abusrour — the director of a youth center in Bethlehem’s Aida refugee camp — was abducted by the Israeli military as he returned home to his newborn child and wife. In early December, he wassentencedto six months of “administrative detention,” an apartheid-style policy that allows the Israeli government tojailPalestinians without due process.\nOther Stanford alumni have been at the forefront of human rights advocacy for Palestine. Omar Shakir ’07 J.D. ’13 has served as the Israel and Palestine Director for Human Rights Watch for the past seven years, despite beingdeportedby the Israeli government in 2019. Dr. Tanya Haj-Hassan ’06 is a pediatrician member of Doctors Without Borders and has volunteered in both Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Fadi Quran ’10 is the campaigns director for the global campaigning organization Avaaz. He is a Palestinian community organizer and youth leader who has been arrested multiple times for his human rights work. Shakir, Haj-Hassan and Quran have been interviewed by and/or written for numerous media outlets (CNN, ABC, Time Magazine and Al Jazeera) over the past few months, advocating for the rights of those affected by this unprecedented, ongoing tragedy. Meanwhile, many other alumni, faculty and staff at Stanford have eschewed the public eye and worked behind the scenes instead. Those who make this decision do so out of fear of negative repercussions to them, their families and their careers, a fear we have seenechoedin the dismissals ofcountlessworkers across allsegmentsofsocietyfor publiclyvoicingtheir support of Palestine.\nThis is why it is so essential we support the students involved in the Sit-in to Stop Genocide. We see our younger selves in these students occupying White Plaza, and we hope that this letter, in situating their efforts within a long legacy of activism, fortifies their spirits.\nDeep fissures are opening underneath the edifice of theU.S.-backedZionist project that hasdisplacedandoppressedthe Palestinian people for more than 75 years. The weight of the Palestinian people’sdemands— a permanent ceasefire and lifting of the siege on Gaza; the internationallyrecognizedright of return for refugeesethnically cleansedby Israel in 1948, 1967 and thereafter; an end toapartheidagainst Palestinian citizens of Israel and an end to militaryoccupation,annexationand illegal settlementbuilding— becomes heavier and more urgent by the day. It is within this broader historical context that the International Court of Justice recentlyruled— by a 15-to-2 vote — that the Israeli government must “take all measures within its power” to prevent and refrain from acts in violation of the Genocide Convention, and to desist from further killing Palestinian civilians.\nThe stakes for Palestine and the Palestinian people have never been higher. As Stanford alumni, our moral commitments require us to use our position to advocate not just for peace, but for justice. For these reasons and many more, Stanford students are sitting in. With their presence, they remind everyone on campus of the daily atrocities occurring in Gaza. Their movement inspires those of us who have since left campus to remain hopeful for the future. So, we thank the students for their tireless efforts. Furthermore, we extend our gratitude to the University and its administrators, who have chosen to protect the sit-in and safeguard the students’ free-speech rights. We urge them to continue this policy, and we welcome the university’s decision toestablisha task force that will address the anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab, and anti-Muslim hate on campus, which significantly increased after Oct. 7.\nThese students started their sit-in on Oct. 20, 2023, and have continued it throughout the winter break and into the new year, despite harassment, threats and inclement weather. In doing so, they have accomplished something historic: at 104 days and counting, it is thelongestsuch action to date at Stanford. They have compelled the Stanford community to reckon with both our complicity in this genocide and our communal responsibility to act. As their efforts continue and evolve, we as alumni stand beside them and offer our endless solidarity.\nThis opinion was authored by a group of Stanford alumni supporting the sit-in efforts. While the initial draft was developed by a few authors, they circulated it among private networks to gather editorial feedback and support.\nMaarya Abbasi ’16 M.A. ’17Ziyad Abdelkhaleq ’11 M.S. ’12Salahodeen Abdul-Kafi ’12Olamide Abiose J.D.
