            "inputText": "There’s a problem with how ASU is handling its football department.\nWhile the University has made an effort to improve fan engagement off the field, the actual performance of the team has left fans with little reason to stick around Mountain America Stadium.\nLast Saturday’s game saw a historically severe loss to Fresno State. This 29-0 result marks the first time since1988that the Sun Devils been shutout at home, and the student section was nearly vacant by the end of halftime.\n“In order to win in college football, you need everybody behind you,\" Coach Kenny Dillingham said on Monday during the postgame press conference. \"We need people to stay behind us, stay behind our players, and stay behind the process that it takes to be successful.\"\nThis game performance comes amidan NCAA investigationinto the University's alleged recruiting violations during the COVID-19 pandemic. To make matters worse, ASU decided a self-imposedbowl banwould soften the inevitable blow from the results of the NCAA investigation.\nAfter the disappointing loss, fans took their frustrations about ASU's disappointing defeat to X (formerly known as Twitter).\n\n\nASU alumnus Jeffrey Krieg similarly expressed frustration as a long-time Sun Devil football fan and season ticket holder. Krieg described how he set up an 80-inch TV with surround sound in his garage to watch games from the comfort of his home because of his lack of motivation to come to the game in Tempe.\n\"We’re not only supposed to beat them [Fresno State], but we’re supposed to blow them out,\" he said. “I didn’t watch the entire game because I was just disgusted.\"\nFor fans like Krieg, this waning enthusiasm for ASU football deters them from even attending games in person. From 2019 to 2022, the total attendance decreased by 14%, from 49,166 to 43,081, about a tenth of the stadium capacity. The attendance dip coincides with a worsening record since 2021, with the team finishing 8-5 in 2021, 3-9 in 2022, and starting the 2023 season at 1-2.\n\nThe University tries to engage football fans with a variety of tailgating events, offering 10 parking lots that open five hours before the game and even upgrading concession prices in August. But fans are still not showing up, and those who do head for the exits early.\nHowever, no matter how good or disappointing the team is, tailgating and going to the game in the desert heat is difficult. It was close to or over 100 degrees at the Southern Utah, Oklahoma State and Fresno State games. Fans still have been few reasons to stick around for a losing team in that heat. Thus, ASU can't rely on these off-field engagement efforts to keep the Sun Devil football spirit alive.\nUntil the Sun Devils can improve their performance, nothing in ASU’s playbook can cure growing fan apathy as the losses continue to pile up.\nEdited by Mia Osmonbekov, Walker Smith and Shane Brennan.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nReach the columnists atjcsande6@asu.eduandpvallur2@asu.edu, and follow@jcsander23on X.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
