But, a2022 studyby the Canadian Centre of Ethics in Sports found there is no clear advantage Trans women have over cis women.\nIf so-called ‘fairness’ is offered at the expense of inclusion, is it actually fair?\nThe NAIA is masking its transphobia as fairness. Trans women are not trying to take away wins from cisgender women — they are simply competing in sports.\nLooking solely at biological sex, or even hormones, is also not a clear indication of how well an individual will do in a given sport.  Endurance athletes require different abilities than sprinters which is different from hand-eye coordination required for golfers.\nAnd if the concern is over advantages, why is the NAIA not addressing financial privilege? Access to high-quality equipment,infrastructureandsports staffis also advantageous to improved athlete performances.\nWhat makes this advantage okay? Is it really coincidental that the line of an unfair advantage is drawn at Trans women?\nAlthough the NAIA is based in the United States where28 states have active bans on Trans women in sport, reactionary transphobic views are on therisein Canada too.\nThe reaction from some members of our UBC community on a r/UBC subreddit thread plainly demonstrates why we needed to write this editorial in the first place. One Redditor wrote “Anyone who opposes this is delusional,” while multiple others commented “good” or “W.”\nTransphobia is unacceptable.\nAdditionally, as of publication time, UBC Athletics has not condemned this ruling, despiteother universities doing so.\nThe lack of swift action from UBC Athletics to protect its student athletes and to show support for the 2SLGBTQIA+ community — for which it does duringvolleyball’s Pride Night— is incredibly disappointing.\nOther collegiate athletics governing bodies are not in line with this policy.U Sports’s — which all other UBC varsity sports except rowing compete under — allows transgender athletes to compete in line with either their gender identity or sex assigned at birth, just not both during the same season. TheNCAAtakes a sport-by-sport approach to account for what advantage in each sport actually means. The International Olympic Committee hasstatedit is not relying on testosterone levels to determine significant advantages amongst competitors.\nWhen other sporting bodies have stepped up, the NAIA stance is clearly a step backwards.\nSports are an incredibly important resource for better physical and mental health while also providing opportunities for better resilience and community building.\nTrans women should not be excluded from women’s competitions. To ban them from participating sends a very strong message that Trans women are not women and that they are not welcome in sport.\nAll athletes deserve an equal and fair opportunity to compete.\nThe following resources are available to students looking for support:\nEditorials represent the opinions of the editorial board ofThe Ubyssey.This editorial represents the opinions of the105thUbysseyeditorial boardwhose term ends April 30, 2024.\nShare this articlecopied!\nUbyssey Editorial Boardauthor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
