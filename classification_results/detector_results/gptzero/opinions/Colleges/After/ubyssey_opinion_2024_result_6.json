Elena Massing is the Culture Editor forThe Ubyssey.\nEvery April, the courtyard outside the Nest transforms into an EDM music festival, complete with a confusing maze of chain link fences, an ear-splitting sound system and frat guys vomiting in the corners. It costs $89.\nThis is Block Party, and it's been consistently losing the AMS money for the past seven years.\nLast year, Block Party ticket sales brought in an estimated$250,000 lessthan anticipated, and we’re paying for it out of our student fees. The year before was a similar story. Even pre-pandemic, Block Party was criticized for charging too much forticketsto see artists that most students don’tknow or care about.\nWho are they marketing to that would pay upwards of $60 to see French Montana? (If that’s you, congratulations! Genuinely, happy for you. But, surely you can appreciate that you’re in the minority).\nThe current Block Party scene is dominated by first-years and guys in fraternities — which leaves out a lot of campus.\nBut how many girls in Doc Martens do you see everyday? Hanging from their shoulders are tote bags covered in Lord Huron and Phoebe Bridgers pins, and in these bags are wads of cash just waiting to be spent on concert tickets.\nThe current Block Party model isn’t working. To revive student life, AMS Events can do two simple things: reduce ticket costs, and start booking local acts that more people actually want to see.\nIt may seem like a paradox that to make money, you have to become indie. But, in Vancouver, on a college campus, this is what you must do.\nVancouver has a thrivingmusic scenethat UBC students are central to. Rather than flying out artists with little or no connection to this city or this campus, why not support better-loved (and probably cheaper) local talent? These local acts prove, year after year, that they actually candraw in a full house.\nCase in point: Goosehunt, Blank Vinyl Project’s annual concert, sells out in minutes.\nThis year, Goosehunt early bird tickets were $17 — general admission was only about $10 more than that. If finances are a barrier to students wanting to get in on the fun, BVP is also willing to help out by offering a limited number of pay-what-you-can tickets.\nBlock Party tickets this year are $89 to see Don Toliver. Don Toliver is cool and people like him, but $89 for tickets? For an audience of students? In this economy?\nCiTR hosts a similar annual initiative calledShindig, which is set up as a battle of the bands, rewarding the winner with a label, publicity and studio access.\nBlock Party shouldn’t compete with existing music initiatives, but it could learn from them.\nThis isn’t to endorse the epidemic of every Vancouver band being four white guys with three guitars, two brain cells and one Strokes cover between them. But, it’s clear that, despite its shortcomings (a lot of bands that basically look and sound the same), the local model sells. Block Party could build on it by spotlighting a wider array of genres and bands.\nLocal also doesn’t just mean indie rock — why not highlight local EDM DJs that the frat crowd, or even the bisexual docs crowd, will like?\nUBC students are hungry for connection, culture, a sense of pride in our community and an accessible way to get fired up on the last day of classes to good live music. Block Party doesn’t provide that, but it could.\nThis is an opinion article.
