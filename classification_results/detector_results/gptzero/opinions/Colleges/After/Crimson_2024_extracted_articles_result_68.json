            "inputText": "On April 9, we — as members of the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee —launched a petitionfor a student opinion referendum on divestment from “Israel’s Occupation of Palestine.”\r\nThe petition and language of the question were both initiated with the approval from the Harvard Undergraduate Association’s Election Commission and the Dean of Students Office.\r\nIn just three hours, we reached 195 signatures — the minimum number needed to trigger a referendum. According tothe HUA Constitution, a referendum, once triggered, must be held within three weeks.\r\nYet, a day later, the HUAblocked this referendum.\r\nInstead of commencing the signature verification process, as constitutionally mandated, the PSC was notified of an internal move within the HUA to form a problem solving team to solve a constitutional dispute on referendum policies.\r\nConveniently, all referenda have since beenindefinitely postponed.\r\nThe decision to form the team came after an unrecognized organization — claiming to be called “Are Harvard Students, Students Against Hate?” — raised a racist, antisemitic petition parodying the PSC referendum. Instead of responding to the vitriol raised in the parody petition, the HUA moved to stall all referenda, leaving the student body — including peer HUA officers — blindsided.\r\nThe content of this petition, some of which directly seeks to disparage the PSC’s activism, is undoubtedly racist. The DSO and the HUA might claim we are the unfortunate victims of this “counter-petition” that mocks our plea for divestment. But, this implies that the inciteful stunt is comparable to a legitimate, administratively approved, and procedurally permitted call for a vote on divestment.\r\nPermitting the petitioners of such problematic content to disrupt HUA procedure further erodes the little faith we had in the institution.\r\nReferenda and their purview in the HUA Constitution are poorly defined. However, this is certainly not the first time students have voted in a referendum on a highly political topic, unrelated to student government policy.\r\nJust last week, over 77 percent of undergraduate voters supported the creation of an “Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights” concentration at Harvard, putting their backing behind a highly political field grounded in a critical study of empire and diaspora. Additionally, over 92 percent of voters affirmed that Harvard should designate U.S. Federal Election Day a College-wide holiday.\r\nWhy now does the HUA suddenly reckon with its unclear referendum process — one that has previously always allowed for poll after poll?\r\nIt is no coincidence that the word “Palestine” reaching the ballot triggered the HUA’s sudden constitutional crisis. We are now waiting for a decision from a “Problem Solving Team” for a problem not big enough to address until “Palestine” came into the picture.\r\nThe denial of this vote is yet another example of the Palestine exception to free speech.\r\nThis repression is not new to us. However, the extent to which institutions are willing to establish bad precedent and twist democratic procedure to maintain such an exception is baffling.\r\nThe HUA cannot arbitrarily refuse its constituency the right to have its political voice heard — especially not when Harvard’s vulnerability todonor pressureand right-wing politicians has become clearly established.\r\nOn a campus where Palestinian and pro-Palestinestudents are left unprotectedfrom harassment and cyber violence, their activism repressed, and grievances dismissed, a secure avenue for polling students on this issue is the bare minimum we demand.\r\nIn suddenly choosing to clamp down on political speech, the HUA is mirroring the same flimsynotions of “neutrality”that have been raised by Harvard’s administration. There is no “neutrality” when Harvard University hasinvested hundreds of millionsin the violation of Palestinian rights.\r\nHarvard and the HUA may have repressed the referendum on divestment for this semester, but the fight has only just begun.\r\nAs colleges across the country — and schools across Harvard’s own campus —embrace resolutionsand referenda on divestment, the University is forced to reckon with the will of its own student body. Like it did with the apartheid regime inSouth Africa, Harvard will once more realize that doing business with a settler colonial apartheid state is not sustainable.\r\nHarvard can continue to release more task forces, claiming to listen to student opinion through highly decentralized and lethargic conversations with administrative officials. Yet, it cannot expect us to tacitly accept these gestures as promises of safety — not when the University continues to invest in a perpetrator of genocide against Palestinians and fails to protect our communities from violence.\r\nShraddha Joshi ’24 is a Social Studies concentrator in Pforzheimer House.
