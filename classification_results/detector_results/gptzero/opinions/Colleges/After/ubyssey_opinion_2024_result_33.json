But Senate can often be hard to understand for the average student and the agenda docket can be super long and dull to read.\nSenate Recentred is written by members of the Student Senate Caucus to demystify Senate by giving students a snapshot of what Senate is doing this month.\nHere’s what to expect at the May 15 Senate meeting.\nDr. Arig al Shaibah, associate vice-president, equity and inclusion, will be presenting on the progress of the Strategic Equity and Anti-Racism Framework. Here’s some things we found notable:\nProgress on Strategic Actions:The StEAR typo Framework outlines strategic actions, such as building more multi-faith prayer spaces and creating an Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Education Hub. Out of the 93 institution-wide strategic actions,50 per cent of the actions are in progress, 2 per cent are pending confirmation, 27 per cent are completed/ongoing, 17 per cent are not yet started and 4 per cent on hold. Out of the 41 strategic actions at UBC Vancouver, 44 per cent are in progress, 5 per cent are pending confirmation, 32 per cent are completed/ongoing, 19 per cent are not yet started and 4 per cent are on hold.\nExecutive Demographics:The report outlines the demographics of the UBC executives and UBC executive senior leadership and compares it to the demographics of senior managers nationwide. The UBC executive group had a higher representation of women and racialized people, but no representation of Indigenous, disabled, non-binary, Transgender and 2SLGBQIA+ people. The executive senior leadership group had aligned representation of Indigenous and racialized people but a lower representation of women, no representation of non-binary and transgender people and less than five 2SLGBQIA+ people.\nStudent Survey Responses:In 2021, 31 per cent of respondents agreed that “UBC is committed to the wellbeing of its people, place, and community.” That fell to just 24 per cent in 2022, with the answer being a shockingly-low 10 per cent for Transgender and non-binary students.\nTwelve new endowed awards, 16 new annual awards, and onenew internal award are being voted on for approval. Some of the largest include:\nThe provost is presenting a document called “Draft Principles and Guidelines for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in Teaching and Learning”, a comprehensive 1-page document of proposed rules for the use of AI at UBC. Some notable guidelines include:\nBased on the recommendation of the Curriculum Committee and the Admissions Committee, the Student Senate Caucus will ve oting to approve the creation of a new partnership and a dual degree with the University of Helsinki, the Master's of Forestry in Green Business (UBC) and Master's of Science in Agriculture and Forestry (Helsinki).\nAdditionally, the Admissions Committee released a report of all international partnerships that they approved and renewed via their delegated authority. It is important to note, due to the current geopolitical context and theongoing protests, that this report included the renewal of partnerships with Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, (approved November 2023), Tel Aviv University (approved November 2023) and Hebrew University of Jerusalem (approved March 2024).\nThis will be the last regular meeting of the Senate until September 2024.\nIf you have questions for the Student Senate Caucus, you can email co-chairs Kareem Hassib atkhassib@student.ubc.caand Jasper Lorien atjasper.lorien@gmail.com.\nShare this articlecopied!\nKareem Hassibauthor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
