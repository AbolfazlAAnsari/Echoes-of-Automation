The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors.\nIsrael is a special place and arguably the most misunderstood in the world. We will be celebrating Israel’s 75th birthday at Rice, commemorating the occasion with a conference hosted by the Baker Institute on April 27, 2023. It is important to understand that the Jewish connection to the land of Israel goes back thousands of years. Jews werealwaysin this land before Israel was created. As I prepare to graduate, having founded aStudents Supporting Israelchapter at Rice, I want students to be informed about Israel and Palestine. There are many people who spew misinformation and will not want to listen to facts because of the false narrative they love to believe.\nI want to celebrate Israel, as the ‘‘Israel at 75’’ event at the Baker Institute plans to. However, Students for Justice in Palestine at Rice is demanding to cancel the event.  SJP is a national organization rooted inviolence. They call for boycott, divestment and sanctioning of Israel. In doing so, this hurts Palestinians. For example, when Ben and Jerry’s decided to remove their stores in the West Bank as an uninformed political statement, they hurt the lives of thePalestinians they employed. In 2018, SJP at the University of California, Irvine was placed on atwo-year probationdue to their actions against an Israel culture club hosting a movie screening for “discriminatory and disruptive behavior again against Jewish and pro-Israel students.” I hope students recognize the hypocrisy anddangerof their ideas. They are adangerto those with opposing ideas and I hope Rice students can conduct their own research on what SJP does and what SJP says they do around the country.\nThe Palestinian Authority used 8% of its budget as of 2017 in order to paysalariesto terrorists or the families of terrorists who murdered Israelis. The deadlier your attack, the bigger payment your family receives. This policy is known as thePay for Slay policythat the U.S. Congress voted against in a bi-partisan law called the Taylor Force law. Taylor was a U.S. Veteran andVanderbilt studentwho was murdered by a terrorist that got rewarded for the killing. The hubris of college students around the U.S. that claim apartheid and war criminality, especially at Rice, do not understand the Palestinian experience. In no way does Israel represent an apartheid and theclaim is ridiculous. The boycott, divestment and sanction movement repeats this lie loudly and ceaselessly. I encourage anyone who is unfamiliar with the topic to find out what it’s like to live in Palestine territory and talk to those who they wish to support. I also want Palestinians in the Middle East to not feel displaced and to have a stronger feeling of home, but this should not come at the expense of Zionists who are willing to find ways for both people.\nI want to thank Rice for the opportunity to attend “Israel at 75” and a chance to learn more about how world leaders are addressing the conflict in Israel and Palestine. I would have to wait 25 years for Israel’s 100th birthday to know where the next big celebration is and I definitely won’t have an opportunity to attend an event quite like this one ever again.\nI will always have hope for a better future. I will always stay informed. Spreading hate is never the way. Many people act out, but we all have the power as leaders to right the wrongs of past generations. Let’s work to unite people with correct information and a will for peace and collaboration.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
