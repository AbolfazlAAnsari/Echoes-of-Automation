We’ve held our tongues since then, as we can appreciate that circumstances change and growth is good. But the time has come for us to speak again, this time in support of resurrecting the greatest of all pre-COVID traditions: Sunday brunch.\nPicture this: you wake up on Sunday morning with a slight headache (who knows why). You shuffle out of your room towards the servery, and what do you find? An omelet bar, homemade tortillas and the smell of little caramelized waffles wafting toward you. This used to be a weekly occurrence, and oh boy, was it magical. Recapping the previous night’s events over smoothies, funfetti pancakes and chilaquiles was the pinnacle of every week.\nTo be clear, we are in no way critiquing the removal of this marvelous experience. COVID-19 precautions called for spreading out mealtime attendance in serveries to the fullest extent possible, and brunch was combining the attendance of two meals into one. But for the life of us, we cannot think of a good reason why Sunday brunch cannot or should not now return to our serveries.\nSo to David McDonald, or whomever it is at Housing & Dining that decides the meal schedule, we humbly request on behalf of the student body that Sunday brunch be returned expeditiously. For one thing, it will temporarily subdue students’ anger at their lack of HBO Max access. For another, it’s just the right thing to do. If nothing else, do it for the Texas-shaped waffles.\nEditor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board.
