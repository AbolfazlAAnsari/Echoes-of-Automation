Amidst a tsunami of anti-translegislationand growing transphobia across the nation, it is not unsurprising that Stanford’s ownstudent-organized neofascist clown carwanted to get in on the action.\nFirst, we must dispel a few silly myths. Sex ismore complicatedthan asimple binary, and variation in gender identity and expression iscommonin many cultures across the world. Trans peoplehave always existed. Childrenknow their gender identity,do not transition on a whim,rarelystop,are ableto make the decision to transition and have normal levels of stresswhen allowedto transition. Doctors are not blindlyhanding out puberty blockers. Trying to convince people not to transitionis harmful. Letting trans people use the restroomwillnotleadto predators harassing women in bathrooms; on the contrary, trans people are the ones who areroutinelyharassedandassaulted. Letting trans people play sports willbenefit teams and athletes. Less thanhalf of a percentof people regret gender-affirming gonadectomy surgeries, and people who detransition most often do so because ofsocietal and familial pressure.\nIn truth, opposition to trans-inclusive policiesis a function of latent transphobia, adisgust at nonconformitythatleans towards fascism. Policies that dictatewhich lives are acceptableandwhich are condemnedto a state oforganized abandonmentfall neatly in line with thelong tradition of eugenics in America. Indeed, calling the recent wave of anti-trans sentiment across the worldgenocidalisno exaggeration. Gender-affirming caresaves lives. Restricting access is an attack on the ability of patients, parents, and physicians to accessnecessary medical care. Trans rights are fundamentally questions ofbodily autonomy, of our right to exist in society as we are and not as we are told to be.\nIt is at this point we would like to note that writing these lettersis exhausting. While news organizationsdebate our right to exist, while right-wing grifters try to figure outhow to interact with uswithout being hilariously awkward, we have been busy taking care of our owntime and time again. We have figured out how tonavigate a labyrinthine mazeof gatekeeping and malpractice to medically transition. No matter how dire the circumstances have seemed, we haveorganized, we haveprotested, we havedone it ourselves, we havebuilt a better world together. And we aretired. We don’t actually want to spend our free time writing letters because SCR has decided to screen a documentary that tried todupe trans people into participatingin yet another 90-minute elaboration onthe same old transphobic stupidity.\nWould you like to know what we mysterious and unknowable transgender beings want instead? We would like to not be murdered forsimply existing. We want our gravestones tohave our actual names. We wantenough food to eat. We wanthousing. We want to bepaid fairly for our labor. We want to be able togo to the doctor. We want tosurvive.\nNo, we want tothrive. We want hormones handed out likeskittles. We want toplay with our appearancelike a cat with a toy. We wantpiercingsandtattoosandblue hairandleather. We want totry out new namesevery hour. We want to useall the pronouns you’ve heard of, andall the genders you haven’t.We wantto be beautiful, we wantto be sexy, we want toChili’s-Awesome-Blossomour way toa happy new vagina, we want totake the big dick. We want tocreate filth, tobe gay and do crimes, to make your favorite charactersall trans. We want our parents tolove us, and we want our children todream. We wantliberation. We wantfully automated luxurygay space communism. We want to betipsy & free, we wantfloor length bolshevik dresses, we wantall the flowers kneeling.\nAdi Xiyal Mukund is an M.D./Ph.D. student in the Biophysics program and is on staff at QSR.\n\n"
