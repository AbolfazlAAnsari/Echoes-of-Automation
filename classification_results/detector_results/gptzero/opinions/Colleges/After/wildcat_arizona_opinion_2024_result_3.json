            "inputText": "\n\nIf you don’t live under a rock, you probably are aware of the current popularity ofTaylor Swiftafter her career-definingEras Tourand the subsequent movie premiere. Swift has beenbreaking record after recordthis year with there-release of some old albumsas well as the release of her brand new albumMidnightslast year.\nWhether you are a fan or not, her current levels of success are compelling. Amidst this popularity around her music,  fans and speculators have followed her new relationship withKansas City Chiefs star, Travis Kelce.\nThroughout her20-something year long career,entertainment media has closely followed Swift’s love life, tracking her current relationship status and its relevance to her music of the time. In an interview withSwift with theLos Angeles Timesfrom 2015,she mentions beingdiscouraged from the dating scene after the media has heavily intervened with her personal life and created false narratives about her true intentions. She said, “ …everyone’s calling you boy crazy, making jokes about you at awards shows? That’s public humiliation. And I don’t think it’s fair.”\nRegardless of who her partner was at the time, she faced scrutiny and patriarchal questions and digs by the media about her love interests; questions and comments that male celebrities with similar power in Hollywood do not often get asked with the same frequency.\nUnfortunately, the patriarchy of celebrity interviews is not a new phenomenon, as women have suffered in the limelight for many years. Oftentimes, women are asked invasive questions about their body or their sexual history.\nIn an interview withDeutsche Presse-Agentur, a German news outlet,Swift was asked when she plans on having kids since she had just turned 30. She responded, “I really don’t think that men would be asked this question when they turn 30, so I’m not going to answer that now.”\nWith all of this past traction around her love life in mind, it’s no surprise that her and Kelce’s relationship has made headlines considering his popularity in his own respective field. This time, Kelce is experiencing a taste of these invasive questions and the overall experience of having your relationship speculated and highlighted opposed to milestones in your career, which women have faced since the dawn of time.\nMen are frequently the ones asking the invasive questions to their female counterparts in interviews. Almost always, women do not ask other women patriarchal questions regarding their personal life, since they too often understand how it feels to, first, be violated, and second, have people base your career around your relationships (or lack thereof).\nMen are typically not asked these questions since the media views them as more than just a partner, rather an individual with a career that is the reason they are successful, not due to the proxy of their lover. Oftentimes, male celebrities’ relationships with women are just a footnote of their media coverage.\nIn a recentpress conference with the Kansas City Chiefs, Kelce was asked ifhe’s “in love,” and was pestered about the current status of his relationshipand the whereabouts of Swift at recent games. He responded with, “I’m going to keep my personal relationship personal.”\nTikTok users responded to this same interview posted byCBS Sportswith comments saying,“Reporters need to stop. And stay with football.”“Keep it personal my a**. They’re making a business out of it. Absurd.”“Nobody cares omgggg.”“You know the fans have got to be SICK of seeing and hearing about Taylor!!’ She’s beautiful and talented yet so overrated!! Stick to the game.”\nHowever, PR fromESPNseems to be running with this whole Kelce and Swift thing despite negative feedback from sports fans in posts surrounding the relationship. According tothe AP and a representative from Fanatics, a sports merchandise website, eversince Swift’s first appearance at Arrowhead Stadium, Kelce jerseys have spiked 400% in sales. ESPN has posted countless photos of Swift and friends at the gamesonESPN’s own socialsas well asNFL’sandKC Chiefssocials.\nSwift’s personal account as well as ones managed by her teamhave yet to post or comment on this relationship.However, during her recent concert in Argentina she changed the lyrics to her song“Karma” from “Karma is the guy on the screen ” to “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs,”alluding to her current relationship.\nIt’s also noteworthy to mention the “chase” element to this relationship that is part of the reason it gained so much traction.At first, Swift was apparently not interested in Kelce; he was upset that she didn’t want the friendship bracelet he made for her when he attended her concert.However, he was persistent enough to get in communication with her, which highlights another element of the patriarchy of relationships.\nWhile it’s unclear what Kelce’s true intentions were when trying to connect with Swift, this shows how some men feel entitled to women and getting their attention whether or not the woman is interested. The “locker room culture”that sports media has created from this relationship is shameful, although not surprising.\nMany believe that Swift cannot maintain a relationship due to her own faults. Although, her past relationship withJoe Alwynis an example of some men’s paralyzing fear of inferiority, which can be to blame for her failed love interests.\nThese theories are analyzed in books like“The Love Gap,”which explains that when a woman earns a higher salary than her male lover, he could feel subordinate while yearning for a more“traditional” heterosexual relationship dynamic. Since Kelce is incredibly successful in his own field, it will be interesting to see how this shifts that narrative about Swift’s ability to date long term.\nAgain, whether or not you are a fan of these two celebrities, it is engrossing to watch their relationship evolve via media involvement. This is a time when the gears are shifting; male stars and their fans are experiencing a hint of the intrusion and its irrelevance to one’s career that comes with being in an A-list relationship.\nAnnabel is a UA student studying journalism and studio art.
