At Stanford, a recent survey conducted by the Graduate Student Councilfoundthat 78% of respondents reported that they could not meet minimum standards for covering rent, health care, food and transportation. Anecdotally, these statistics are made real to me when, in advising and mentoring meetings, students confide to me that they are deferring needed health care or relying on local food banks for their groceries. It is tragic that in thefourth richest countyin the United States, and at Stanford University, with thefourth largest endowmentof any United States college or university, many of our graduate students are struggling to meet basic human needs.\nThe situation is only getting worse: the recently-announced 2023-2024 cost-of-living adjustment for graduate student wagesfalls below inflation ratesfor the third year in a row. Affordability issues are affecting Stanford’s ability to attract, recruit and retain the most talented graduate students in our disciplines. And researchshowsthat financial concerns have a direct impact on graduate student motivation and degree completion. Data from the UC system validates this: since graduate student workers gained union recognition, doctoral degree completion hassteadily increasedacross the UC system. In other words, graduate student unionization appears to support, rather than detract from, graduate students’ academic progress.\nIn the weeks and months ahead, Stanford administrators may trot out the same familiar anti-union rhetoric that UC Berkeley administrators used in the 1990s. If they do, don’t believe the hype. Collective bargaining doesn’t disrupt advising relationships between graduate students and faculty. Instead, it enhances our academic community by ensuring that graduate workers have the dignity of union representation when they negotiate with the University. That’s why I stand with the Stanford Graduate Workers Union — and why other faculty should too.\nDr. Barbara L.
