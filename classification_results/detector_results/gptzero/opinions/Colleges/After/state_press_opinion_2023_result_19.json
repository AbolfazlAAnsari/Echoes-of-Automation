            "inputText": "\"While both forms of citizenship are to be encouraged, there is a problem: this lack of affinity towards duty-based citizenship too often impedes the desires of younger generations.\"\nYoung people have historically had thelowest voter turnout rates. Often this is attributed to a lack of interest, however, it's not that simple.\nWhile there are many contributing factors, one of the most significant today is the unique form of civic participation younger generations tend to favor:engaged citizenship.\nEngaged citizenship is the practice of partaking in activist behaviors that aim to directly drive political and social change outside the confines of the electoral calendar. Examples include participating in protests, petitions and boycotts.\nEngaged citizenship differs from duty-based citizenship, upon which the United States has built its political structure. Duty-based citizenship refers to the practices that traditionally come to mind when thinking about \"model civic participation.\" Examples here are voting in elections, reporting crime and serving on a jury.\nThese two forms of citizenship are not exclusive. One can exhibit both, but as a general trend older people tend to be more inclined toward duty-based citizenship and younger people tend to favor engaged citizenship.\nWhile both forms of citizenship are to be encouraged, there is a problem: this lack of affinity towards duty-based citizenship too often impedes the desires of younger generations.\nSure, petitions, protests and association lobbying can all make statements and bring attention to important issues. However, they are simply insufficient when it comes to bringing about the force of law. This points to why we must also engage in duty-based citizenship. We need to vote.\nFundamentally, the political structure in the United States is designed in such a way that voting is the most effective way for citizens to express and enact their political will. Consequently, the U.S. government is dominated by the views of the older population which turns out at a greater rate for elections.\nPoliticians appeal and cater to those who are going to cast a vote and put them in office. It follows, then, that as millennials and Gen Z, we will not see our views infused into government policy until we step into the voting booth in significantly greater numbers.\nFor evidence of this, look no further than the 2022 midterm elections. Younger voter turnout wasthe second highest for a midtermin the past 30 years and theybroke hard for Democrats, even in swing states.\nTraditionally young voters had a roughly 20% turnout rate for midterm elections. In the 2022 midterms, it hiked up to about 27%. This was a leading contributor to the notable lack of the expected \"red wave.\"\nConsider Arizona, which based on past voting patterns seemed as susceptible to a \"red wave\" as any state. Yet, this did not happen. Why not? Sure, the Republicans put up low-quality candidates. However, another major factor was the youth support for Democratic candidates.\nDepending on the individual race, between71% to 76%of the youth vote went Democratic. In fact, when Sen. Mark Kelly was asked at which point on election day he felt confident in his victory, he said, \"When I saw the local news and they were reporting about the long lines at Arizona State University, like 30 minutes before the polls closed. I turned to somebody and said, 'We’re going to win.'\"\nThe weight of the youth vote wasn't only felt in Arizona. Other key battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia had outcomes that were also highly dependent on younger voters. Even states where the Democratic candidates did not win felt the effects.\nLook, for example, at Wisconsin, where Republican senate incumbent Ron Johnson had every reason to believe the expected \"red wave\" would return him to Washington. His race against Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes, however, was much closer than anyone had anticipated — largely due to the efforts of younger voters,63%of whom were Democratic.\nIn the end, Barnes finished only1%behind Johnson, a fact that teaches us two lessons. First, the youth vote isincreasingly going to be a key factorin election outcomes. Second, a national 27% youth turnout is still not enough.\nInterestingly, there is an opportunity for us to put our money where our mouth is in just a few weeks. In May, there will be a special election in Tempe. This election will either uphold or nullify the city council's decision to rezone large portions of land on Tempe Town Lake as \"mixed-use\" and initiate the construction of an entertainment district.\nREAD MORE:Tempe special election for Arizona Coyotes arena and entertainment district, explained\nMany younger residents of Tempe have concerns as to how this willaffect housing costsas well assustainabilityefforts and the environmental consequences. But just expressing concern is not going to be enough. We need to ensure we mobilize and get out to vote. That is likely the only way our concerns will be seriously taken into account.\nUltimately, given the way the U.S. system is set up, engaged citizenship isn’t effective unless accompanied by duty-based citizenship. While millennials and Gen Z possess massive potential political power, until we cater to the system of government already in place we simply cannot make it cater to us.\nEdited by Kate Duffy, Jasmine Kabiri and Grace Copperthite\nReach the columnist atnatalieckerbel@gmail.com.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
