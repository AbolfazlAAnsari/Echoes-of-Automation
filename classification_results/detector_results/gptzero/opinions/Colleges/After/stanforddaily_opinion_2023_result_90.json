            "inputText": "This is the second article in the Editorial Board’s three-part series on revitalizing Stanford student life. This piece focuses on how the Stanford community — students, alumni, faculty, governance and administration — can work towards a more accountable future.\nAt long last, it appears the wind of change is blowing on Stanford’s campus. After adisastrous year for Stanford’s reputationand amid a brewing storm of student, alumni, and faculty discontent, there are signs that the University may be changing course. The Provost has unexpectedlyresigned. The President may beunlikely to survive. And the newly elected ASSU Executives promise areturn of funto revive Stanford’s ailing student life.\nAs much as these changes in leadership are welcome, they risk being a temporary reprieve. Only when true accountability reaches across the entire Stanford administration — from middle management to those delivering front-line student services — can we fix the lasting damage to the university and students’ experiences and well-being. To achieve this, Stanford stakeholders need to act collectively to hold administrators at all levels responsible to the community they serve.\nFirst, we must take stock of the toll that Stanford’s unchecked administrative growth has taken on student life and consequently the university’s standing. The viralPalladium articleandour previous editorialhave detailed how the Stanford administration’s relentless campaign to absolve itself from liability has decimated student life and made campus less safe. But the problem of administrative malfeasance extends far beyond destroying the“esoteric whimsical nature”of Stanford culture. From student groupsstruggling for fundingwhile beingtightly controlled by administrators, to international students despairing if they’llreceive visa assistancein time so they can stay in the country, to the anxious wait forfinancial aid support, to hungry students resorting tofood bankssince groceries on campus areextortionate, to stillnot having enough counselorsto address the mental health crisis on campus, Stanford student services are unfit for an institution claiming to be among the best in the world. Instead of learning and developing, students find their Stanford experiences and communities wracked by inadequate services and excessive bureaucracy.\nThe rampant expansion in administration and regulation is actively hurting Stanford’s strategic interests. When students spend their days fighting administrative battles, they become reluctant to advocate for, or eventually donate to, an institution that seems to only want toexpand the number of staff and administrators— currently17,000strong — who were in many cases detrimental to their experience. When it becomes harder to convince the very brightest that Stanford is the place where they’ll thrive — when current students themselves have no confidence in the university’s leadership — it hurts the well-being of the Stanford body and Stanford’s standing relative to its peers. The ongoing disillusionment of students burdened by administrative incompetence and overreach threatens tospill into the public sphere.\nThe fundamental problem isa lack of accountabilityfor administrators. This has been driven by a loss of institutional knowledge and connections between students, alumni, faculty, and university governance from the pandemic that has made it harder to collectively organize. Administrators have had free rein to push throughunpopular policiesand expandregulationsthat prioritize reducing liability over enhancing opportunity.\nWhen challenged, administrators set up “task forces,” “accelerators” and “working groups”that delayand distract from action. Often, offices dealing with students eagerly shift responsibility onto another part of Stanford’s labyrinthine network of administrators (the Office of the General Counsel and“Risk Management”are classic favorites) which makes it impossible to pin down who exactly can solve problems.\nIf all else fails, they simply wait students out until we are exhausted or graduated.Students feel powerless. We currently do not have the resources to resist, so individual administrators can act with impunity since there is no direct accountability or transparent feedback from those they serve.\n“Administration” can be a nebulous concept.To strike back, members of the Stanford community need to understand how Stanford operates and consequently what specific levers of power we can pull to bring about change. The key isincreasing transparency and collective action.\nA revolutionary step would be to implement a feedback system for administrative services in a manner similar toCarta, where students anonymously share their evaluations of teaching staff. If student feedback ratings were tied to administrators’ performance reviews, this could massively drive up standards. And as recent leadershipchangesshow, the Stanford community expressing its collective views can advance the university. This radically new system is unlikely to be adopted by the University (we would love to be proven wrong), but in its absence, how can stakeholders act to protect their interests and guide Stanford towards a better future?\nStudents, Alumni, and theASSU\n\nFaculty, Governance and Administration\n\nAn alum recently remarked to an Editorial Board member that “Stanford today has become like the government — but worse.” As a society, we have learned that it requires transparency and accountability to ensure that those in positions of power serve their constituents. While administrators may not yet be formally accountable to the student body they serve, as members of the Stanford community we have both the responsibility and ability to keep the university on the right track. Through increasing collective action and doing our part to hold the university administration to account, we can ensure that Stanford’s winds of freedom continue to blow.\nTheEditorial Boardconsists of Opinion columnists, editors and members of the Stanford community. Its views represent the collective views of members of the Editorial Board. It is separate from News.\nThe Stanford Daily Editorial Board comprises Opinions Editors, Columnists, and at least one member of the Stanford Community. The Board's views are reached through research, debate and individual expertise. The Board does not represent the views of the newsroom nor The Stanford Daily as a whole. Current voting members include Chair Nadia Jo '24, Joyce Chen '25, YuQing Jian '25, Jackson Kinsella '27, Alondra Martinez '26 and Sebastian Strawser '26.\n"
