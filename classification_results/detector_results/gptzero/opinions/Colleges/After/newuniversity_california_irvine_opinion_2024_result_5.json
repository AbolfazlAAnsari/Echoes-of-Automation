            "inputText": "I’ve been around UCI since 1996, as a grad student, TA, GSR, student government leader, conference organizer, alumnus, lecturer, interpreter, UROP mentor and judge, internship supervisor, … heck, one summer I even packed up, moved and unpacked several professors’ offices in a brand-new building.\nI’m on my fourth chancellor now; they get bored, or retire, or climb to a higher office. As the Associated Graduate Students’ president, I used to have lunch with Chancellor Michael Drake. Over 28 years, lots of protests, rallies, strikes, meetings and lunches, bills and resolutions, somehow Chancellor Howard Gillman is the first person to insult me publicly to my fellow Anteaters, including my dean, my course director, all of my colleagues, even my current and former students.\nI was arrested during the police raid on campus on May 15. You may have seen my frog-march TV interview or the May 16th LA Times front page photo, if you weren’t there watching in person. Hours later, Gillman claimed to have summarily barred all students, community members and faculty — that is, me and one professor, both quite prominently — arrested during the police action. In official terms, to bar someone summarily requires that he “reasonably find” them to be “a substantial and material threat of significant injury to persons or property.”\nExcept that he did NOT bar me from campus. Whether he claimed to do so but did not, or tried and failed, he falsely smeared me as a violent threat to all of my colleagues and current and former students as I went about teaching my seminars, holding office hours and other duties.\nI learned of this supposed ban from my course director, who was surprised and concerned to see me on campus, based on a blast email from my dean, who had parroted Gillman’s false claim to all of my humanities colleagues. Feeling compelled to leave campus or risk arrest or citation, I drove home, forcing me onto Zoom at the last minute, wrecking a day of teaching and student conferences.\nWhile harmful to me in a specific way, with real material, emotional and career consequences, that act of his was only one drop in eight months of campus-wide trickle-down calumny and cruelty, incompetence and cowardice from the fifth-floor C-suite in Aldrich Hall, which culminated in a cascade on May 15. I offer a few examples of each:\nCalumny\nCruelty\nIncompetence\nCowardice\nIn his 2022 UC Community Safety Plan, UC President — and former UCI chancellor — Michael V. Drake’s introduction acknowledges that “[t]oo often, the same systems charged with providing protection have become a source of great distrust and fear. This plan to re-envision safety at the University of California starts by acknowledging that reality.” The plan later emphasizes respecting “existing guidelines that minimize police presence at protests, follow[ing] de-escalation methods in the event of violence and seek non-urgent mutual aid first from UC campuses before calling outside law enforcement agencies.”\nBy the chancellor’s own account, he chose not to de-escalate in the event of violence, to the degree that he could reasonably make that call, relying on social media accounts to do so. ZotALERTs initially blared that “several hundred” protesters had occupied PSLH, only later in the dead of night muttering that there were only “several,” drop the hundred. Not so much invading the building — they just stood around it, he admitted.\nThese actions provoked serious reflection about their foundational moral causes. What is it in a man that would cause him to fail in some of his most solemn administratively and ethically clear obligations to ensure our safety and rights and privileges as Anteaters? What sort of man uses his powerful position to belittle, insult and threaten students, faculty, academic programs, beloved community members, free speech itself, on our campus?\nIn formal settings, Gillman wields his ceremonial mace–a bludgeoning weapon that symbolizes his executive power to smite anyone beneath him at UCI. However, behind closed doors, he wields an axe–a budget axe that strikes fear into deans, department chairs, program directors and beyond, for so many believe him to be biased in his interests and vindictive in his responses to things he dislikes.\nSitting in jail with my newfound friends, and later at home, checking in on other arrestees as we recovered, talking about it with my wife — also a UCI alumnus with a teaching credential and MA and PhD in History, I have sometimes turned to the field of moral philosophy, specifically to the work of Professor Aaron James, an honored member of our Department of Philosophy, with whom I have taught in Humanities Core. I have returned to some of the texts we read together, and his later publications. For the non-specialist, I recommend especially his bestselling book from Doubleday,Assholes: A Theory(2012).\nChancellor Gillman has shown himself to be an equivocating, petty, dishonest man in this whole affair since October — to me, to my fellow arrestees and I firmly believe, to students, staff and faculty. The damage he has wrought on our campus is clear, as is his unsuitability to be the person we look to as we begin to repair it.\n—-\nBrook Haley, PhD (UCI 2007)\nContinuing Lecturer\n"
