Some are very serious, some are only mildly serious — and we leave it up to y’all to figure out which are which.\nRice should replace the current campus buses with electric ones. There are so many benefits to this switch, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, lower maintenance costs and a cleaner, more modern appearance on campus. But most importantly, getting stuck behind one of the current buses while biking the inner loop does a number on your lungs for the rest of the day.\nThe Honor Council’s new ChatGPT policy is arbitrary and impossible to enforce. Instead, the university should require faculty to individually determine the extent to which AI software is allowed in their course assignments and reflect that in their syllabi.\nWhen True Dog was initially introduced to campus, we were going to urge the Rice community to give it a chance. After we tried it, we realized those thoughts were premature. We’re glad we held off on that one.\nA big shoutout to H&D, both the housing and dining arms. Housing staff, we realize that we’ve put y’all through a lot this year, and we know that most of your work goes unnoticed, so thank you. Dining staff, both the food and servery set-ups have been noticeably better this year, and we appreciate it.\nOne crucial thing we learned this year is the importance of increased mental health support in the Rice community. We urge the administration to increase funding for the Wellbeing and Counseling center to sufficiently address student needs.\nAnd finally, we are absolutely begging y’all, please stop making people get wristbands for public parties.\nEditor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Ben Baker-Katz, Morgan Gage, Bonnie Zhao, Hajera Naveed, Nayeli Shad, Riya Misra, Michelle Gachelin, Daniel Schrager, Prayag Gordy and Brandon Chen.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
