            "inputText": "Graduate workers need wages that won’t simply be eaten up by Stanford’s company town.\nThe Stanford Graduate Workers Union (SGWU) has been bargaining with the University since November. Most of this period was focused on negotiating the non-economic terms of the contract, which will define the working conditions of graduate workers. SGWU provided itsinitial proposal on wageson July 11, and last week, the University presented its initial counterproposal: a 3% increase annually for the next four years.\nHow generous was their offer? Compare it to the 4.5% rent increase starting this September, following the increases between 3.5% and 4.5% every year during the past five years, as well as a 7.2% increase in the price of the graduate meal plan and a 10% increase in the cost of dependent health insurance coverage. All of this is on top of an annual inflation rate between 3% and 7% that has persisted since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\nBefore the pandemic, University administration convened an Affordability Task Force (whose findings were never published), which only resulted infew improvementsdirected toward graduate students that came years later. Stanford sets our rent so high that we graduate workers areforced to make cutselsewhere, and the University continues to raise our rent faster than our pay. The line for the monthly food pantry pop-upcontinues to stretchhours long, as it has for years. For these reasons, SGWUproposed an immediate and substantial raisefor all graduate workers so we will no longer be rent-burdened and indexing future wages on rent costs and inflation.\nWhen workers elect to be represented by a union, as the graduate workers of Stanforddid overwhelminglyin 2023, employers are obligated to negotiate with the union before unilaterally changing working conditions, wages or benefits. Generally, unions and employers reach a contract to set clear bounds on what can and cannot be changed without further bargaining.\nStanford’seconomic counterproposalstates that the University would have the right to rescind existing tuition, medical and transportation benefits for graduate workers, just like they did with the Caltrain GoPass in 2022. They ignored international graduate workers, even though visa fee support is now standard among union contracts. Their proposal does not guarantee workers’ representation on committees that advise on graduate healthcare plans. There was nothing too small in SGWU’s initial proposals for Stanford to reject.\nDuring bargaining, Stanford’s spokesperson quickly pivoted the discussion to the University’s ability to recruit new talent into Ph.D. programs. They also stated that other factors and perks — like Palo Alto’s nice weather — justify Stanford paying its graduate workers less than a living wage.\nSGWU provided its initial economic proposals on July 11, and Stanford provided its response on Aug. 7. Their proposal is an effectivewage decreaseand avacation policystricter than what is currently standard practice. Beyond that, their proposal codifies the status quo. With so few details in their counterproposal, Stanford could also have provided it much sooner, such as on the afternoon of July 11th. Their stalling tactics could delay our contract past our scheduled pay raise in September.\nThe SGWU Bargaining Committee has spent months dealing with the University’s stonewalling tactics and unproductive counterproposals. As shown on theSGWU Bargaining Tracker, Stanford neglected many of the non-economic proposals for months before looking at them. Contrast the frequency, productivity and substance of the MIT administration’s responses and response times, shown onMIT-GSU’s Bargaining Tracker, with Stanford’s.\nThe University’s bargaining tactics also continue to reveal its hollow commitment to diversity. Its economic counterproposals ignore SGWU members’ needed improvements to healthcare, child care and family support. While presenting, Stanford reiterated anondiscrimination proposalthat claims to prohibit discrimination based on some characteristics, but specifically excludes the case of sex discrimination from protection.ConsideringStanford’slong-runningissues withsex discrimination, the proposal is irresponsible and ineffective.\nFurther, Stanford’s nondiscrimination proposal is designed to minimize accountability. The University and SGWU have agreed to agrievance procedureby which SGWU and the University will mediate disputes. Yet, the University proposed that the grievance procedure would not apply to discrimination. Instead, they propose an abbreviated procedure that kicks in after the University finishes investigating the discrimination through a lengthy process, which can span as long as it chooses. SGWUwants timely, complete and real protectionsfor everyone who experiences discrimination, harassment of any form or power abuse.\nStanford,do better.\nGraduate workers, let’s work together to secure the contract we deserve. Come to SGWU’s conversationtrainings, connect with your coworkers, and let’s bring Stanford back to the table with a serious offer.\nJason Anderson is a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in aeronautics and astronautics. Parth Nobel is a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in electrical engineering. Alexa Russo is a seventh-year Ph.D. candidate in anthropology. All three are members of the Stanford Graduate Workers Union Bargaining Committee.\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and  letters to the editor.
