ASU beat Nevada 98-73.\nBobby Hurley's tenure as ASU men's basketball coach was in question weeks ago. After starting 15-3, the team dropped nine of its last 13 games to finish the regular season 20-11.\nOnly a desperatehalf-court heaveby Desmond Cambridge Jr. to beat Arizona in Tuscon kept the team's NCAA Tournament hopes alive, and a solid conference tournament run ended up being enough to get the team into March Madness.\nWe could say \"what if\" all we want about Cambridge Jr.'s game-winner orASU's conference tournament run.\nHowever, the fact is that ASU made the NCAA Tournament, won a game and nearly won a second. They also beat Arizona in Tucson, a feat not accomplished since 2019.\nIf a Sun Devil fan were told that was how the season would go before the season started, it's highly unlikely they would be doing anything more than asking for an extension of Hurley's time at ASU.\nLuckily, that's exactly what happened, as Hurley's contract has been extended through the 2025-2026 men's college basketball season.\nREAD MORE:ASU extends basketball coach Bobby Hurley's contract through 2026\nThat's not to say, of course, that Hurley's 2022-2023 season was all roses. The middle-of-the-season collapse before the trip to Tucson was a horrific blemish on what was, at one point, a historically excellent season.\nOne could argue that barely making it into the tournament with the talent the team had was a disappointment in itself.\nYet, the heights that the team reached are much more important than the lows that Hurley saw during this past season.\nOver his tenure, Hurley has taken the Sun Devils to the NCAA Tournament a total of three times. In the seasons when the team didn't make the NCAA tournament, its win-loss percentage was at least close to .500 and they may have made the NCAA tournament in the 2019-2020 season if not for the tournament being canceled.\nThat is a track record of success. It's not excellence, perfection or close to the loftiest of standards for Sun Devil fans, but it's still success.\nImportantly, Hurley isn't just a good coach; he's a good person.\nMichael Randle, an ASU basketball fan, went to the ASU versus Arizona men's basketball game in Tucson, the game where Cambridge Jr. hit the half-court shot.\nAt the game, Randle said he was called racial slurs by a fan who was upset with the ASU gear Randle was wearing. After the game, Randle received a call.\n\"Coach Hurley was one of those people that called me and apologized for me having gone through that,\" Randle said. \"I don't care about what other people say about Coach Hurley, I love the man as a human being.\"\nHurley is also loved by his players. After the team'sNCAA Tournament loss to TCU, Cambridge Jr. tweeted out his feelings and showed his support for Hurley, tweeting \"#TeamBobbyHurley.\"\nUnfortunately, Hurley's team next season is going to look much different.\nAt the least, Cambridge Jr. and Luther Muhammad will not be returning to the team, as both have exhausted their playing eligibility. Devan Cambridge, Warren Washington and Alonzo Gaffney are seniors but still have remaining eligibility. Those players were the heart of this Sun Devil team.\nThat doesn't mean Hurley won't have talent to work with. Even if those players leave, guys such as Frankie Collins, Jamiya Neal, Austin Nunez and DJ Horne hold promise.\nSlight regression next season should be expected, but ASU fans should remember this past season as a sign of how things can be for ASU men's basketball when key players have time and experience.\nHurley has proven himself to be able to succeed, and now he has time to take the squad to the next level.\nWhether or not letting Hurley go after his new extension would be a good decision remains to be seen, but Sun Devil fans need to remember that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.\nFor now, they should applaud the 2022-2023 team and its accomplishments, and then lend support to a team that could be on the way to new heights for a program that hasn't reached its highest potential.\nEdited by Kate Duffy, Reagan Priest and Caera Learmonth.\nReach the columnist atastigile@asu.eduand follow@StigileAaronon Twitter.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
