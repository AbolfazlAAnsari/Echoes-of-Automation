Katie Hobbs may attempt to remove its funding from being earmarked specifically for the school.\nIf the earmarked funding is removed, the University will still receive that money, but will be allowed to allocate it wherever it chooses, which could still be toward SCETL.\nIn fiscal year 2023, SCETL received a budget allocation of $5,804,100 and will have just over $9 million available in total. With all that money, the school only served 735 of the 142,616 students enrolled at ASU in Fall 2022.\nWhat a shame it would be if SCETL's funds weren't directed toward itsimportant societal contributions. If it didn't receive its funding, then it wouldn't be able to pay for a $200,000 copy of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations or trips to Sedona and India! One can imagine the positive experience a student or professor who can barely afford housing must have when they flip open the dusty pages of Smith's writings.\nYeah – it's shameful.\nMore importantly, around the country, public education and marginalized people are under attack. Not only arebooks being banned in K-12 schools, but state legislatures are restricting colleges and K-12 schools from providing studies about gender and race.\n\"As a Black man, most of the books that I've seen or heard of being banned always have to do with the Civil Rights Movement or something to do with slavery, and it's like, to me, I don't understand, why are you restricting knowledge?\" said Kendrick Adams, a junior studying criminology.\nThe same legislatures and governors leading these attacks are also attacking the LGBTQ+ community, particularly transgender people.\nThe Arizona State Legislature and the Koch brothers are no exception. The Legislature has repeatedly promoted anti-LGBTQ+ bills, and the Koch brothers have funded anti-LGBTQ+ institutions and politicians.\nSo, how can one say that SCETL, a Koch-backed, Arizona State Legislature-funded institution deserves any legitimization from ASU?\nIt doesn't, and to continue its existence at a University that claims to be defined by who it includes and not who it excludes, isn't just a contradiction; it's the not-so-tacit promotion of American conservatism and the hate it advances.\nYet, there are institutions at ASU that promote diversity and progressive thought. TheSchool of Social Transformationand theSchool of International Letters and Culturesare each great examples.\nSCETL funding would be put toward the well-being of the ASU community if it was taken from SCETL and invested in the progressive and inclusive institutions that do exist at ASU.\nIt's not an unimaginable thought, with Hobbs potentially creating an opportunity for the \"freedom school\" budgets to be spent elsewhere.\nASU students and faculty should demand SCETL funding is moved to other institutions that actually promote the stated University values, and the University's leadership should support initiatives to remove earmarks for SCETL funding.\nEdited by Kate Duffy, Reagan Priest and Caera Learmonth.\nReach the columnist atastigile@asu.eduand follow@StigileAaronon Twitter.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
