            "inputText": "\"College is already expensive as is, so when the program adds additional expenses for equipment needed to be in the major, students are less inclined to study nursing.\"\nNursing students at ASU have to pay large amounts of money on out-of-pocket expenses for equipment and travel required for the major. This limits access to the program and hinders students’ ability to go into a field that is in high demand.\nEdson College of Nursing and Health Innovationassociate dean Katherine Kenny and senior director for recruitment and student success Nancy Kiernan said in an email that ASU nursing students are required to pay for scrubs, stethoscopes and specialized shoes.\nAn officially licensed location to purchase this equipment is Apparel Pro. Nursing students said they are required to use ASU-branded nursing gear, and Apparel Pro is one of the more common locations students use to purchase this equipment.\nAccording to theApparel Pro website, the ASU dress code reads, “Students are required to purchase all uniform items with the ASU CONHI insignia through the approved vendor. These items include: wine scrub jacket, wine scrub shirt, white polo shirt.”\nAlison Berg, a sophomore nursing student at ASU, said the added expenses create a “stressful environment.”\n“I feel like it should be provided, in a way, because we’re trying to do our clinicals and work and everything like that just to get our education,” Berg said.\nThere are also other expenses, such asCastlebranchregistration ($163), NCLEX test registration fee ($200), ATI testing (ranging from $400-600), textbooks, a drug and alcohol screening ($80), a criminal background clearance ($74),My Clinical Exchangefees ($40) and other ASU fees.\nATI testing, a nursing learning tool, costs an estimated $400 per semester for traditional nursing students but can cost upwards of $600. Stethoscopes, uniforms, shoes and skills bags cost an estimated $600 to $800.\nOn top of those necessities, nursing students also have to find a way to go to and from the hospitals they are assigned to for clinicals which are hands-on hospital work required for graduation.\nREAD MORE:Nursing students face challenges to find transportation to required clinical experiences\n“A lot of people do struggle with transportation, because it’s all just on your own,” said Kyle Beer, a sophomore studying nursing.\nNursing students fill out a form before clinicals start to name location preferences, but Beer said students can still be placed far from their preferences.\nAll of these obstacles create boundaries to accessibility for before and during the program.\nCollege is already expensive as is, so when the program adds additional expenses for equipment needed to be in the major, students are less inclined to study nursing.\n“Nursing education is highly sought after, which leads to a very competitive application process,” said Hadaad Dine, a sophomore nursing student in the accelerated program. “So, if somebody is worried about financial aid… they might just completely decide not to go into that field.”\nThere are things that nursing students said ASU could do to make the nursing program more accessible.\nOutside of having the various expenses paid for, they suggested implementing a program where nursing students could donate equipment that could then be rented out to other students at a cheaper price.\n“I feel like they could have a hand-me-down program,” Berg said.\nTheaccelerated programalso provides a reimbursement for transportation and required equipment for students, but the regular nursing program does not.\n“We need to pay now, to purchase the items ahead of time, but once they verify financial aid, they’ll give us a reimbursement of those scrubs, textbooks and all the stuff,” Dine said.\nGiven that there’s ashortageof nurses in the U.S. following COVID-19 burnout, it’s wrong that so many obstacles are placed in the way of becoming a nurse.\n“In a time where everybody’s saying there’s a nursing shortage and we need more nurses, and even the nursing program itself wants to get as many people as they can, you’re making it a little tough for a lot of people to do that,” Beer said.\nThe statement provided by Kenny and Kiernan said, \"Students are encouraged to file aFAFSAand work withASU Financial Aid and Scholarship Servicesregarding financial aid.\"\nASU should cover the added expenses that nursing students need to pay, and it should introduce measures to make the nursing school more affordable until all expenses can be covered.\nEdited by Kate Duffy, Jasmine Kabiri and Anusha Natarajan.\nReach the columnist atastigile@asu.eduand follow@StigileAaronon Twitter.\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nWant to join the conversation?
