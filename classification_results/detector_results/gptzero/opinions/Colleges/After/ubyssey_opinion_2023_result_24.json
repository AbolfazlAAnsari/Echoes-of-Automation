And only a handful got it right.\nWe get it. We have 11 editors, over 200 contributors and 70 staff writers, and at one point or another, we’ve all asked ourselves “How do you pronounceThe Ubyssey?”\nOther student paper’s names are pretty self-explanatory. Many have the name of their school or mention a mascot — takeTheMcGill DailyorThe Varsityas examples. But, not us. Our paper’s name is a play onThe Odyssey. And because of that, our paper is calledThe Ubyssey.\nSo we’re setting the record straight.The Ubysseyisn’t pronouncedyou-bee-see,you-bye-seeoryou-bussy. It’sYOU-bih-see.Ubyssey.\nBut why?\nThe Ubysseywas established in 1918, after two years of printingThe Ubicee— which wasn’t a full newspaper, instead it was a single three-columned page of text.\nThe first editorial renamedUbiceetoUbyssey, taking inspiration fromThe Odyssey. Why? We don’t know. We weren’t alive.\nBut the editors of volume five were. And theywrotethat “the ‘Ubicee’ was destined to become the ‘Odyssey’ of the University,” hence the 1918 name change and the creation of the full newspaper we have today —The Ubyssey.\nIfThe Ubysseyis supposed to be theOdysseyof UBC, what isThe Odyssey? Are we actually the Odyssey of our school?\nLet’s break this down.\nAccording to Wikipedia (we love your work),The Odysseyis one of two major ancient Greek epics written by Homer — no, not the guy fromThe Simpsons, it’s this random Greek guy considered one of the most influential authors in history.\nIt follows a warrior named Odysseus and his journey back home after the Trojan War. After the war, people thought Odysseus was dead, so his wife, Penelope, was going to get remarried.\nWe can’t speak on behalf of past editorials on if their wives had plans to get remarried, but no one on our board has experienced this. But, we have experienced being an epic student paper.\nThis past year alone, we were nominated for16 national student journalism awards(and won 9 of them), we publisheduniversitynews,deep-divesinto policyissues at UBC, coveredartsandculture,sports andathletesandscienceandresearch, we publishedstudentopinionsandjokes, all whiletakingphotosandmakingvideosanddesigns.\nSure, we’re a newspaper with a hard-to-pronounce name inspired by an ancient Greek poem about a guy who sucked at getting home, but the firstUbysseyeditorial got it right. We’re just likeThe Odyssey. We’re pretty epic.\nIfOdysseyis pronounced\n/ˈɒdəsi/ orodd-ih-see,Ubysseyis pronounced /jubɪsi/ oryou-bih-see.\nNotyou-bee-see. Notyou-bye-see. Notyou-bussy(even though it’s kinda funny). It’syou-bih-see.\nWe’reThe Ubyssey.\nLast Words are written by the editorial board ofThe Ubyssey.\nShare this articlecopied!\nUbyssey Editorial Boardauthor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
