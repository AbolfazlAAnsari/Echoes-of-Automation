            "inputText": "Over the past nine weeks, students showing solidarity with Palestine have been incessantly accused of supporting terrorism — I have received comments, emails and social media messages claiming that I support beheading babies.\nAs an American Muslim, these slanderous accusations are not new to me. In the spirit of open dialogue, I wish to respond with my personal view on the ongoing crisis in Gaza, shared by many other Muslim students who I have spoken with.\nDespite what many Western media sources, including our student newspapers, The Daily and the Review, will have you believe, the ongoing violence in Gaza is not the fault of Islamist terrorists. Not only is this rhetoric one-sided and simplistic, it is also misused and abused by oppressive regimes around the world.\nThis rhetoric of terrorism is used bythe Chinese Communist Partyagainst the Uyghur resistance,the Indian governmentagainst the Kashmiri resistance and theMyanmar militaryagainst the Rohingya resistance. In all these cases, a state with a powerful military purports to be “fighting terrorism” as an excuse to brutally attack and oppress indigenous Muslim populations in their homelands. Israel uses the same strategy to ethnically cleanse Palestine by claiming to fight Hamas while bombarding all of Gaza.In 2001, George W. Bush paved the way for the weaponization of this rhetoric when he declared his “Global War on Terror” to justify invadingIraqandAfghanistan. This is nothing more than a ploy drawing on theIslamophobic trope that Muslims are violent and barbaric.\nAccording to theUnited Nations Refugee Agency, there is no internationally accepted definition of terrorism; however, “as a minimum, terrorism involves the intimidation or coercion of populations or governments through the threat or perpetration of violence, causing death, serious injury or the taking of hostages.”\nTerrorism is terrorism, whether it’s committed by a state or a stateless people. Terrorism is terrorism whether the U.S. government acknowledges it or not.\nIsrael is most deserving of the “terrorist” title in this conflict, especially given their lack of mitigating circumstances: they are not being occupied or blockaded, they have international support and they have advanced military technology capable ofprecise targeting. Why, then, are Muslim students asked to condemn Hamas, while advocates for Israel are not asked to condemn the IDF?\nWhat is Israel’s excuse forlevelingresidential buildings? Or targetingrefugee campsandschoolswith airstrikes? Orcutting offelectricity, food, medicine and fuel to all of Gaza as collective punishment? Ordroppingwhite phosphorus on civilians? Or ordering over a million Gazans to evacuate beforebombingan evacuation route? Or murderingover 170 civiliansin theWest Bank, which is not governed by Hamas, while the world is distracted bygrave risk of genocidein Gaza?\nThere is no excuse.The Israeli government is a terrorist organization.\nMany on campus claim that supporting Palestinian resistance makes me a terrorist sympathizer. But then what does that make those who justify Israel’s crimes against humanity by saying, “Hamas is holding human shields” and “Israel has a right to defend itself”?\nWas every one of the14,000Palestiniansslaughteredso far a human shield?\nThe strongest military in the Middle East had tobutcher 4,000 kidsanddisplace 1.5 million civiliansto defend itself?\nIf there was a rumor Hamas was hiding inside an Israeli hospital, would that justify blowing up the hospital? How about an Israeli daycare center?\nThose who misuse the rhetoric of terrorism center the conversation around Hamas, butthe cause of this crisis is not Hamas.Palestinians have been decryingviolenceby Zionist militant groups long beforeHamasexisted. And, even aside from Hamas,anyone whohas everfought backagainst Israelwasdesignatedaterrorist.\nYou do not need to support Hamasto recognize this hypocrisy. Nor do you have to be Muslim or Arab.ManyJewsandformerZionistshave blamed Israeliapartheidfor the recent violence becausethey understand where our focus should be.\nTo those who criticize us for not condemning Hamas: We Muslims are tired of being spoken down to. We’re tired of moral grandstanding from Western people. We’re tired of condemning groups we’re not affiliated with. Those who arrogantly demand condemnations from Muslims shouldfirst condemn the Israeli government. Then, and only then, will you have earned the moral capital to demand condemnations from me.\nAs Americans, ourtax dollarsfund military aid to Israel, not Hamas. Stanford partners with Israeli companies complicit in the occupation, not with Hamas. Our administration condemned Hamas intheir letter to the communitybut said absolutely nothing about Israel’s atrocities.\nAtruckwas seen andphotographedby Muslim students on campus with the following message written on it in Arabic: “Warning: Stay away 100 meters or you will be shot at.” Palestinian and Muslim students on campus have received threatening phone calls from strangers and alumni, been doxxed,defamed, regularly harassed (even by a professor) andassaulted. Many pro-Palestinians on campus don’t publicly comment because they fear these consequences. Anti-Zionist speech has always beenstifledin this country.\nAll of this is why I choose to focus on Israel and not Hamas.\nI condemn theracistethnostateof Israel, and I condemn anyone who asks me to condemn Hamas without first condemning Israel.\nAs a Muslim, it is part of my faith to oppose the killing of innocent civilians. Any harm to innocent Israeli or Palestinian people is undoubtedly horrible and should not be condoned. My heart goes out to all the affected families who lost loved ones and are hurting on both sides.\nTo truly honor the lives of the victims and prevent this from ever happening again,we must stop the terrorist group directly responsible: the Israeli government.\nThis conflict did not start on Oct. 7.Palestinianshavebeengettingslaughteredanddisplacedfor75years.\nIsrael’s government cannot slowly eradicate the Palestinian population and not expect a violent response. The international community cannot continue to support Israel or remain silent and not expect a violent response.The recent violence is the direct result of Israel’s occupation of Palestine.\nKilling civilians is not justified. But under theseconditions, armed resistance against the Israeli military and policeis justified. On Oct. 7, Palestinians and their allies were not celebrating the death of Israeli civilians; we were celebrating Palestiniansbreaking out of their prisonandattacking military posts. I support armed resistance as Palestinians struggle to end Israeli terror, while simultaneously opposing deliberate harm to innocent civilians.\nThere are many historical cases of civilians being killed by an oppressed group that is using armed resistance to overcome their oppressor. We look back at these today and understand that we must focus on the root cause of the oppression. For example,Nelson Mandela’sparamilitary wingof the African National Congress, which was designated a terrorist organization by South Africa, the U.S. and the U.K., conducted several bombings that killed police officers and civilians.\nYet when we talk about South African apartheid, we start and end the discussion with the injustice of apartheid. The same is true for the AlgerianNational Liberation Front’s attacks against the brutal French colonial government,slave revoltsagainst American plantation owners andNative American attacksagainst European colonizers.\nThis does not mean those civilian lives don’t matter — quite the opposite.It means their blood is on the hands of the colonizing, occupying and terrorizing force.\nIt’s important to not get stuck in an echo chamber. We hear pro-Israeli perspectives every day on CNN, Fox, MSNBC and other Western news outlets. Weseean abundance offalse propagandaspreadbyZionistsinmainstreammediatostoke fearagainst Palestinians and Muslims.\nThis is not a new phenomenon. In the 1990s, George H.W. Bush used false testimony of Iraqi soldiersremoving babies from incubatorsto justify the American invasion of Iraq. In 2001, the “weapons of mass destruction” lie was used to invade Iraq again.Fear-mongeringallowsgovernmentstomanufacture consentand act on entire populations with impunity.\nI encourage readers tobe critical. Check sources. Demand explicit evidence. Keep in mind that Israel has along historyof lying about itscrimes. The massacresin Gaza, on the other hand, areundeniable. Palestinians do not need to lie becausethe reality is far worse than is even imaginable.\nAs the great Malcolm X said, “If you’re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people being oppressed, and loving the people doing the oppressing.”\nMany students like myself are happy to engage in respectful and productive dialogue. Straw-manning our position as a defense of terrorism or antisemitism is intellectually dishonest and unconducive to progress.\nThose willing to support the children of Gaza canhelp attheselinks. And to those Zionists who photograph,doxxand attempt tosilence pro-Palestinianstudents: Feel free not to hire me. In fact, please don’t, I would never work for you anyway.\nMay God protect Gaza and all innocent people around the world.\nHamza El Boudali ’22 is a master’s student in computer science.\nAfter editors introduced a change to align with linked substantiation, this article was updated at the author’s request to more accurately represent his perspective.\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and  letters to the editor.
