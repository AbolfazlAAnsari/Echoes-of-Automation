Unlike what Effie Trinket said inThe Hunger Games, the odds are not in our favour.\nAs if this series of unfortunate events wasn’t bad enough, if you find someone you want to kiss, cuddle or hold hands with all the time… get ready to be seen everywhere.Unlesssomebody (IDK, maybe me!) gave you a slight tip on where to avoid the crowds.\nI’ve recently found somebody who is willing to deal with my insanity all the time — voluntarily (I have a boyfriend)! So, now that I have field experience with showing him around campus, I knew I had to list some verified PDA-hotspots for youlove birds to nestin too.\nOkay, it’s late Wednesday night and things got spicy at The Pit. On the walk home, the vibes get a little exciting, and you think “fuck it, where do we go now?”\nEnter: The North Parkade, arguably the best thing to come out of the area near Walter Gage Residences generally. People hate Gage so much, they literally park their cars and bounce out of there like their lives depend on it. This happens to be fortunate both for PDA-seekers and the raccoons who live there.\nOnce you get past how damp it is (bonus points if you actually have a car, but don’t drive after drinking at The Pit!), the parkade is actually pretty quiet and so unnecessarily labyrinthine that I guarantee you, you’ll find some privacy.\nPersonally, I can’t recommend this one enough. Not only do virtually no students go here because of how far it is from central campus, but you’ll also probably only see some cute dogs and other couples like yourself.\nIf you’re looking for a sweet little walk through a pretty park while holding hands with someone, this is the place for you. Seriously, it’s devastatingly underrated for how beautiful it is, and being away from other students means less chances of running into someone you know… right?\nYes, I’m being cliche, but that’s EXACTLY the point! Because the expectation is to be cute and cheesy at the rose garden (where people literally have weddings), you get a free pass for some PDA.\nFor sunsets and snuggles, this pretty slice of campus is ideal for simps like me and you. And even if you run into someone you know, so what? Get them to take a picture of you and your person looking post-cardy… and save the kissing for later.\nLove NestisThe Ubyssey's dating column — both satire and serious.
