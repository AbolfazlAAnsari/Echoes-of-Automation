Its contents are current to October 19.\nAs members of the UBC academic community and educators committed to principles of social justice and equality, we are troubled by the statement that UBC Interim President Deborah Buszard issued on October 11 titled “Supporting the UBC Community.”\nThe statement explicitly refers to “the atrocities from the terrorist attacks on Israel” but remains silent regarding the ongoing state terror committed by Israel against Palestinians.\nAt the time of this writing, and as reported by UN bodies, human rights organizations and news agencies, Israel has:\nThese actions are a clear violation of international humanitarian law and amount to crimes against humanity. They are taking place while Israeli officials continuously dehumanize Palestinians. Israel’s defence minister called Palestinians “human animals.” Members of Israel’s House of Representatives, the Knesset, and apologists abroad openly advocate for slaughter, ethnic cleansing and collective punishment, amounting to anotherNakba, or catastrophe, when over 750,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homes in 1948.\nPresident Buszard’s statement also makes no reference to Palestine or Palestinians, choosing to refer instead to “Israel, Gaza and elsewhere.\" The erasure of Palestine as a geography, Palestinians as a people, and their plight as a nation dehumanizes Palestinians and denies them the fundamental right to safety, security, freedom and liberation. It runs contrary to the claim that UBC is committed to “providing a safe, inclusive environment, with a shared value of peaceful relations.” UBC’s declared support for decolonization and practices of equity, diversity and inclusion ring hollow in light of this partisan approach.\nSuch dehumanization comes in the wake of similarly lopsided statements by UBC’s Faculty Association and other university administrations across Canada, the US, and the UK. Statements that erase or dehumanize Palestinians may have a dire impact in Palestine and in the diaspora, as made evident by the hate-driven murder of Wadea Al Fayoume, a six-year-old Palestinian-American child in Chicago.\nIn light of all of the above,\nWe send a message of support to all Palestinian colleagues and academic communities across North America and Europe that are facing a hostile climate of intimidation from their governments, media, and university administrations.\nWe affirm the right of the Palestinian people to freedom and sovereignty from Israeli occupation, settler colonialism, and apartheid.\nWe renew our commitment to the safety and well-being of UBC’s Palestinian students, faculty, staff and their allied colleagues.\nWe demand that the UBC’s President’s office:\nSign to support this petition.\nShare this articlecopied!\nMembers of the UBC Academic Communityauthor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
