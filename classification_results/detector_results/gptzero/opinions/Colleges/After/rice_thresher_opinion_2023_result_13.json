The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors.\nIn thearticle“‘All out for Palestine’ protest sees 2,000 at Houston City Hall” from Oct. 17, Associate Vice Provost Catherine Clack discusses the Rice Students for Justice in Palestine sign-making event at the Multicultural Center in the wake of the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in Israel. She states “... how is this something that we should oppose when it's an exercise of free speech?”\nI respect the complexity of issues related to the Middle East and recognize the importance of representing a spectrum of views. But while free speech is a cornerstone of academic discourse, it is imperative that we distinguish between fostering open dialogue and supporting dangerous rhetoric.\nThe slogan “From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free,” prominently displayed in the group's signage, was popularized in the 1960s by the Palestinian Liberation Organization. It helped the PLO — recognized at the time as aterrorist organization by the U.S. State Department— amplify its calls for the dismantling of the state of Israel. As thePalestinian National Charterof 1968 said, “Palestine, with the boundaries it had during the British Mandate [i.e., from the river to the sea], is an indivisible territorial unit … Claims of historical or religious ties of Jews with Palestine are incompatible with the facts of history.”\nThe official policy of Hamas, aU.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizationwhich conducted the Oct. 7 attacks, includes the slogan almost verbatim. Hamas’ 2017Document of General Principles and Policiesstates, “Hamas rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea.”\nOther signs read “Resistance is not Terrorism,” and “Resistance is Justified.” They seem to cast the Oct. 7 Hamas attack as legitimate resistance. Osama Bin Laden’sLetter to Americaused that rationale to justify 9/11. Attacks targeting civilians, even labeled as “resistance,” are unequivocally acts of terrorism. Such actions should never find endorsement or support within our community, even under the banner of free speech.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
