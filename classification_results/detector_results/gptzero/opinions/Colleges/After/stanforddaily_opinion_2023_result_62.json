            "inputText": "I was glad to read President Saller and Provost Martinez’sdenunciationof the atrocities perpetrated by Hamas upon innocent Israeli citizens. They forcefully and unambiguously wrote in their Oct. 11 email to the Stanford community:\nAs a moral matter, we condemn all terrorism and mass atrocities. This includes the deliberate attack on civilians this weekend by Hamas. One of the advances in international law in the 20th century following the horrors of the Holocaust was the development of international humanitarian law prohibiting war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Such crimes are never justified.\nTheir statement aligns with the Oct. 10communicationof the Office of the United Nations Human Rights High Commissioner, with the key exception that the UN is even-handed in its application of international humanitarian law:\nThe Commission has been collecting and preserving evidence of war crimes committed by all sides since Oct. 7, when Hamas launched a complex attack on Israel and Israeli forces responded with airstrikes in Gaza.\nReports that armed groups from Gaza have gunned down hundreds of unarmed civilians are abhorrent and cannot be tolerated. Taking civilian hostages and using civilians as human shields are war crimes.\nThe Commission is gravely concerned with Israel’s latest attack on Gaza and Israel’s announcement of a complete siege on Gaza involving the withholding of water, food, electricity and fuel which will undoubtfully cost civilian lives and constitutes collective punishment.\nLest there be any ambiguity with regard tocollective punishment— “the prohibition of collective punishments is stated in the Hague Regulations and the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions.”\nIsrael is heaping yet more suffering on the people of Gaza in order to punish Hamas. This act of collective punishment goes directly against the international humanitarian law that Saller and Martinez invoke to condemn Hamas.\nThis collective punishment is being meted out against a captive population, 80% of whom arerefugees, 60% of whom areunder the age of 18. In 2010 British Prime Minister David Cameronreferredto Gaza as a “prison.” The Washington Post hasreportedthe death count of Israel’s collective punishment of Palestinian civilians — 1,537 killed, including 500 children and 276 women. Human Rights Watch hasreportedIsrael’s use of white phosphorus on the Palestinian population — “White phosphorus … has a significant incendiary effect that can severely burn people and set structures, fields and other civilian objects in the vicinity on fire. The use of white phosphorus in Gaza, one of the most densely populated areas in the world, magnifies the risk to civilians andviolates the international humanitarian law prohibition on putting civilians at unnecessary risk[emphasis added].”\nThe illegality of collective punishment takes place within an illegalblockadethat Israel has imposed for sixteen years, on top of an illegaloccupationwhich has been in existence since 1967. Since Saller and Martinez predicate their statement on international humanitarian law, let us see what it says about Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory.\nNot all occupations are illegal. There are settled conventions and protocols for how an occupying state must behave if it has placed a people and their land under occupation. The International Red Crossprovidesthis account:\nThe duties of the occupying power are spelled out primarily in the 1907 Hague Regulations (art. 42-56) and the Fourth Geneva Convention (GC IV, art. 27-34 and 47-78), as well as in certain provisions of Additional Protocol I and customary international humanitarian law…\nThe main rules of the law applicable in case of occupation state that:\nIsrael has violated each of these provisions. Let us simply go down the list:\nAs far back as 2017, Israel passed a bill toannexPalestinian lands illegally, As a report from the BBCpointsout in its discussion of Israel’s annexation of Palestinian land, “Annexation is the term applied when a state unilaterally proclaims its sovereignty over other territory. It is forbidden by international law. A recent example was Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014.” On that basis if we condemn Russia’s annexation of Ukraine we should likewise condemn Israel’s annexation of Palestinian land, that is if we are to be morally consistent.\nFar from being “temporary,” theOccupationhas been in effect since 1967. Rather than ensuring the safety and well-being of those under its occupation, Israel has deprived (via its illegal blockade) and is now in its actions of collective punishmentdeprivingthe civilian population of Gaza of hygiene, public health, food and medical care.\nPalestinians under occupation arenot triedin civil courts, but rather in military courts which deny basic constitutional rights to Palestinians, includingchildren, who are not only prevented from quickly obtaining legal representation, but also often from seeing their parents, sometimes for crimes as minuscule as throwing rocks at military vehicles. This suspension of legal protections and the abuse of minors is a form of hostage taking for the purposes of silencing protest and resistance.\nThe unbridledappropriationof Palestinian property by Israeli settlers, armed and protected by the Israeli state, has existed for decades, but has increased exponentially under the rule of Israel’s far-right government, which tens of thousands of its own citizens have beenprotestingfor months precisely because of its attacks on the Israeli court system.\nWhile Israeli Jews have the right to protest when Netanyahu deprives them of their constitutional rights, Palestinians arebeaten, incarcerated and killed for protestingthe assault Israel has made on their lives and the rights guaranteed to them by international human rights law.\nTo silence the monitoring of violations of international humanitarian law, Israel hasdeclaredcivil society human rights organizations “terrorist” organizations. To the grave concern of international law jurists itexpelledformer Stanford Law student Omar Shakir, who serves as Human Rights Watch’s director in Israel-Palestine.\nIn condemning the egregious violations of international humanitarian law performed by Hamas, but not acknowledging those of the other protagonist in the conflict, the statement by the president and provost, at the same moment it declares the importance of maintaining the University’s “neutrality,” effectively exonerates the State of Israel. This makes it impossible for the Stanford community to have any discussion or debate on this topic — those critical of Israeli state policies already run the risk of being labeled “anti-Semites.”\nSaller and Martinez have made invisible precisely the basis for Palestinian claims to the rights guaranteed to them by international humanitarian law; they have exploited and desecrated the very law they use to advertise their moral goodness.\nOnce again — whose lives matter?  Whose lives deserve justice?\nThis article was written by David Palumbo-Liu, who is the Louise Hewlett Nixon Professor at Stanford University, and a professor of comparative literature and by courtesy, of English.\nThis article was updated on the request of the author to directly substantiate their claim that Israel violated this provision: “The occupant does not acquire sovereignty over the territory” within the laws of occupation set out by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and  letters to the editor.
