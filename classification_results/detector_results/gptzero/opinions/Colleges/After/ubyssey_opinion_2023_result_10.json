But just because it’s scary, doesn’t mean it’s impossible. I know it’s something you’ve heard a million times over, but you have to put yourself “out there” to make friends. What does “out there” mean, though? It means going to class and chit-chatting with the person beside you. It means joining a club and actually going to events. And it means hanging out with others on your dorm floor when your RA hosts an event.\nIf you don’t give yourself the opportunity to make friends by opening yourself up, then you won’t be able to do it!\nCampus is huge, and like you said, overwhelming. But you’ve got to remember one thing — everyone is in the same boat. It’s a cliché, but, it’s true. Everyone is just as nervous as you are, and everyone wants to make friends, be loved and have a sick college friend group that does everything together and has a ton of fun and works at the campus radio station and maybe is part of an acapella group and wait I’m just explainingPitch Perfect.\nBut seriously, the classic film that every film bro should study instead ofFight CluborThe Godfatheror whatever, isPitch Perfect. It teaches you how to make friends in university.\nLet me explain: Beca didn’t make friends until she put herself out there by joining the Barden Bellas and getting her radio internship. If she didn’t do those things, she wouldn’t have met Chloe, Jesse, Amy, Benji and others in that cast of literal characters. And if she didn’t make friends, we wouldn’t have gotten aPitch Perfect 2or aPitch Perfect 3and that would suck (I lovePitch Perfect).\nUBC has so many opportunities to meet people embedded into campus culture. From the 300+ clubs under the AMS to support groups, classmates, campus jobs and other communities — university really is the place to meet people.\nAnd hey, if you want to join a super cool community where you’ll make friends (it’s where I’ve met most of my best ones), come visitThe Ubysseyin room 2208 of the Nest. We’re exactly likePitch Perfect, except we’re student journalists and not in acapella. So not really likePitch Perfectat all, but we have fun.\nYou’re doing great. Keep it up!\nNeed advice?
