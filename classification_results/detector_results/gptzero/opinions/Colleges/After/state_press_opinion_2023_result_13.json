By leaving the terms of AI and ChatGPT usage open, professors can provide leeway to courses that could benefit from it or prohibit AI in courses where it's a liability.\nSince ChatGPT's release in late November 2022, institutions are struggling to find the balance between maintaining academic integrity and exploring the potential of AI.\nThecurrent guidelinespermit\"academic units and/or faculty to determine whether student use of generative AI/ChatGPT in their courses is permitted or prohibited.\" This flexibility lets AI positively influence different facets of research, learning, teaching and administration.\nThe University plans to \"positively employ\" generative AI technologies to \"enhance learner outcomes,\" said ASU spokesperson Veronica Sanchez in an emailed statement.\nAndrew Maynard, a professor for theSchool for the Future of Innovation in Society, teaches ASU'sfirst courseon developing professional skills using ChatGPT.\n\"I'm a strong advocate of developing innovative ways of using AI to enhance learning and to make learning more accessible to more people — all while being very aware of the potential pitfalls of using AI in education,\" Maynard said.\nThis course, called \"Basic Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT,\" has been structured and designed by ChatGPT itself. The course teaches students how to make the most out of ChatGPT as a resource.\n\"AI has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in education today,\" the Office of the University Provost said in astatement. \"Nonetheless, as educators and students, we face a new frontier as we navigate a world in which the distinction between content generated by AI and humans is rapidly blurring.\"\nWhile AI has potential to positively guide and support academics at ASU, ChatGPT and other chatbots must be used responsibly.\nCritics point to increased risks of cheating and integrity violations as a deterrent to allowing AI in the classroom. However, academic integrity violations have always been a risk regardless of the presence or absence of this technology.\nREAD MORE:How ASU and its faculty are cracking down on dishonest uses of AI\nKena Ray, assistant director at the Instructional Design and Learning Technology program, said students who intend to plagiarize or break other ethical codes will \"always find a way to do it.\" Ray said AI should help the University reach its academic goals rather than be a hindrance or liability.\n\"The benefits of artificial intelligence – streamlining workflows and improving efficiency – must be balanced with the human elements that are indispensable for scholarly pursuits,\" Ray said.\nThere are no AI detectiontools currently set in place at ASU. Ray said the University is not planning to institute these tools any time soon because they are unreliable.\nAs ASU and other universities navigate the AI landscape, granting more flexibility is the best approach.\n\"We need to learn how to use (AI) responsibly and innovatively to positively scale our impact as an institution, all while understanding and learning how to successfully navigate potential pitfalls,\" Maynard said.\nASU’s current guidelines offer this understanding. They give faculty and students enough adaptability to explore AI as an educational tool that could enrich the learning experience instead of detracting from it.\nEdited by Mia Osmonbekov, Alexis Waiss and Caera Learmonth.\nReach the reporter atclegallo@asu.eduand follow@claire_legalloon Twitter\nEditor's note: The opinions presented in this column are the author's and do not imply any endorsement from The State Press or its editors.\nLikeThe State Presson Facebook and follow@statepresson Twitter.\nClaire Le Gallo is a reporter for the Community and Culture desk at The State Press.
