            "inputText": "To:\nPresident Marc Tessier-Lavigne\nProvost Persis Drell\nJerry Yang, Chair, Stanford Board of Trustees\nCondoleezza Rice, Director, Hoover Institute\nWe write with regard to the fact that Mr. K. Rupert Murdoch is a member of the Hoover Institute’sBoard of Overseers. Given that Provost Drell and Director Rice have stated that they intend “increased interaction” between the University and the Hoover, we address both the Director of the Hoover and the senior administration of the University, as well as the chair of the Board of Trustees, who serve as stewards of Stanford University.\nWe are alarmed that Mr. Murdoch, chairman of Fox News, has facilitated the spread of lies with regard to the 2020 election. Recent information emerging from the lawsuit brought against Fox by voting machine companies Dominion and Smartatic show that Fox News anchors knew the information they were broadcasting to the American people was untrue, yet they repeated these lies over and over again, seeking to increase Fox’s market share and to profit off these lies.\nCrucially, these were not just any lies — the misinformation purposefully spewed out by Fox fueled the Insurrection and continues to form the basis for extremely dangerous beliefs that can, as we now know, translate into catastrophic actions, which include death and real threats to the democratic process.\nMurdoch’s role in this scandal is clear. Fortune Magazinenotes:\nRupert Murdoch acknowledged that he didn’t stop various Fox News commentators from promoting unfounded claims from Trump allies that the election was stolen, even though he could have. He also acknowledged that some of the network’s hosts — Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, Jeanine Pirro and Sean Hannity — at times endorsed the false claims.\nFox shows no sign whatsoever of changing its pattern of deception and deceit for the sake of financial gain. Just recently, even after the exposure of its calculated and cynical dissemination of falsehoods, one of Fox’s most popular anchors, Tucker Carlson, showed cherry-picked segments of video records of the January 6 Insurrection, using these decontextualized bits to make patently false claims about the entire day’s events. As NBCreports:\nCarlson focused Monday’s segment on promoting former President Donald Trump’s narrative by showing video of his supporters walking calmly around the U.S. Capitol. He asserted that other media accounts lied about the attack, proclaiming that while there were some bad apples, most of the rioters were peaceful and calling them “sightseers,” not “insurrectionists.”\nThis revisionist history is not only shameful, it is extremely dangerous — it will encourage the continuance of conspiracy theories about a “stolen” election and exculpate the guilty.\nAs National Public Radiohas stated, this is not the first time Mr. Murdoch has engaged in questionable actions:\nMurdoch has been called to answer for the practices of his media outlets before.News of the World— at one point a flagship tabloid paper for the Murdoch empire in the U.K — was the subject of scandal back in 2011 for reporting tactics that included hacking into people’s phones. The paper shut down and Murdoch was brought before a British parliamentary inquiry…\nformer Australian prime minister and the newly appointed ambassador to the U.S., Kevin Rudd, has spent the last two years lobbying for an inquiry into media diversity in Australia. He has taken particular aim at the influence of the Murdoch media, and called Rupert Murdoch a threat to democracy.\nAs far back as 2010, the Columbia Journalism Review publishedan essayusing precisely the same language, “Murdoch’s Threat to Democracy.”\nLet us be perfectly clear — in this letter we are not asking that you remove Murdoch from the Board. That is your decision alone. What we are asking of you is that you eachpublicly accountfor your acquiescence to Rupert Murdoch’s prestigious appointment to the Board, one which reflects not only on the Hoover, but also on Stanford.\nWe ask — why is it that Rupert Murdoch is an Overseer? Does his expertise outweigh what many find to be his dangerously deficient sense of ethics? At the Faculty Senate meeting of Oct. 22, 2020, Provost Drellopined: “Over the past decade, Hoover has become much more integrated into Stanford.  In a very real sense, and I think this is important to keep in mind, they are, in fact, us.”\nRupert Murdoch is not “us.”\nIn closing, we wonder what kind of signal his presence sends to our students, who we are training to seek the truth, and to our colleagues on the faculty, who are constantly held to the highest standards of honesty, truth and responsible scholarship. Why is someone who has proven himself an opponent to all these values on the Board?\nWe look forward to hearing your reasoning.\nSincerely,Laura Wittman, Associate Professor of French and Italian\nRita Agarwal, Clinical Professor\nThe Daily is committed to publishing a diversity of op-eds and  letters to the editor. We’d love to hear your thoughts. Email letters to the editor to eic ‘at’ stanforddaily.com and op-ed submissions to opinions ‘at’ stanforddaily.com.\n"
