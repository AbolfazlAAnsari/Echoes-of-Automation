The plan also suggests Depop is aware that its shipping produces a large amount of emissions, however, it fails to mention if it has enoughconsumer datato achieve this goal through its renewable offices. If Depop is unable to achieve this, it is essentially greenwashing its customers into thinking it is a sustainable platform.\nAdditionally, selling thrifted clothes for a higher price takes away an affordable outlet for low-incomecommunitieswhere thrifting is a necessity. Many people donate their items to a thrift store for the purpose ofhelpingthose in need, not to have them bought and resold for a profit. It is also important to note that thrifting goes further than simply purchasing clothing, as thrifting furniture and appliances is also common. Low-income communities rely on these essential items as well, and taking this away is unethical and greedy.\nA narrative around sites like Depop and Poshmark is that it also limits the concept of fast-fashion and overconsumption. However, with this growing thrifting and resale market, overconsumption is still an issue, as the secondhand market is expected to grow from $30 billion to $77 billion by2025. Reselling for a profit is simply becoming another form of fast-fashion, as demand will continue to increase for thrifted clothing items, only driving the price higher.\nBetween raising the prices of affordable items and clothing, and greenwashing the public about sustainable practices, sites like Depop are encouraging thegentrificationof fashion. The secondhand market cannot expect to hold fast-fashion and other mainstream fashion industries accountable for sustainability and accessibility if they cannot do any better. Sellers on Depop and other sites need to be aware of this and realize how their actions are unethical and potentially hurting others. There are many other side hustles these individuals can do to make money that are not harmful, and the act of hurting low-income communities needs to stop.\nFollowtheDaily WildcatonTwitter\n\n\nLuke Lawson (he/him) is a sophomore intending to major in accounting.
