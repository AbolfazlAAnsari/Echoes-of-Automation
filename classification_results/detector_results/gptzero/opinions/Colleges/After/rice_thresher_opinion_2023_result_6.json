The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors.\nWhen “Pro-Life After Roe” was published in the Thresher, we were in the midst of finalizing a semester-long report on the state of reproductive rights in Texas. We had spent the day compiling firsthand accounts of the panic, pain and trauma produced by abortion bans. It felt necessary to address the guest opinion and confront the harms of abortion restrictions.\nWe first want to establish that the debate over when “life” begins acts as a detached, moralistic distraction from the real consequences of abortion restrictions. How to weigh the “life” of a fetus against that of the pregnant person and what makes “life” worth protecting are long-disputed philosophical questions. We should be discussing therealitiesof abortion bans and the harm inflicted on communities when healthcare is policed and politicized. We believe that the inflammatory rhetoric of the “life” debate inhibits open conversation around abortion. When one side denounces the other as supporting murder, it becomes impossible to engage in constructive dialogue.\nAt its core, abortion is about autonomy. Since theDobbsdecision,over a dozen stateshave implemented near-total abortion bans. In Texas,abortion provision is a felonypunishable by up to 99 years in prison. Themajority of Americansand themajority of Texanssupport abortion rights, yet their intimate reproductive decisions are constrained and scrutinized by an anti-abortion minority.\n“Pro-Life After Roe” claims to champion “the forgotten in society,” but people of color, low-income individuals, immigrants, minors and other marginalized populationsface disproportionate health and financial consequenceswhen abortion is limited. Onestudyfound that over 72% of people who were denied abortions ended up living in poverty. In Texas, Black women sufferthe highest riskfor poor birth outcomes.\nTexas law includesvague exceptions for “life-saving” abortionsthat thrust physicians into murky legal territory and threaten pregnant people’s lives. The opinion sidesteps the issue of medically necessary abortions by claiming that certain life-saving procedures are not abortions because they do not intend to terminate the fetus. This ignores myriad circumstances in which intentional abortion procedures are absolutely medically necessary.Over 20 accountsfrom the ongoingZurawski v. the State of Texascase attest to the horrors of denying necessary abortion care. Many of the plaintiffs sought abortions because their fetuses displayed fatal abnormalities likeanencephalythat would — and often did — endanger the plaintiffs’ lives if carried to term. Why should someone be brought to the brink of death before being allowed a medically necessary procedure?\nAbortion restrictions exacerbate the extraordinary dangers of being pregnant in Texas. Texas already has thehighest maternal mortality ratein the nation.Over 46% of Texas countiesare designated “maternity care deserts,” with some residents traveling up to 70 miles to reach the nearest birthing hospital. The criminalization of abortion providers has further resulted in anoutflux of medical professionalswho provide essential pregnancy and gynecological care. Texas laws both demand that people carry their pregnancies to termandmake it remarkably unsafe to do so.\n“Pro-Life After Roe” argues that religious organizations supplement prenatal support, but the link provided by the author directs readers to a chain ofself-admittedcrisis pregnancy centers. Often faith-based, CPCs are anti-abortion organizations that masquerade as licensed healthcare facilities. They target uninsured, low-income populations by offering free ultrasounds, then do everything in their power to deter people from seeking abortions. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, at least71% of CPCsspread damaging misinformation, including claims that abortion carries cancer and infertility risks, and lie to people about how far along they are in their pregnancies. Worst of all, they are oftenstate-funded. Crisis pregnancy centersintentionally deceivepeople in order to propagate religious, anti-abortion agendas. Where is the “truth, mercy and love” in that?\nTheRice bubbledoes not protect us from the fallout of abortion restrictions.One in four womenwill have an abortion in their lifetime, the majority of whom are young adults. These areour peers, friends and loved ones, and we must center their realities. On both sides of the abortion debate, circular theorizing about “life” has produced an ideological stalemate. But we can no longer afford to ignore the real harms of abortion restrictions by discussing this issue in a moralistic vacuum. We owe each other honest, pragmatic conversations that challenge preconceived notions, misinformation and stigma. As “Pro-Life After Roe” stated, every person has immutable dignity. Under any circumstance, forcing a person to remain pregnant plainly violates that dignity.\nWe are responsible for shifting the language on our campus — for recognizing abortion, not as a philosophical question but as an essential right. Abortion is a personal decision. Abortion is healthcare.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
