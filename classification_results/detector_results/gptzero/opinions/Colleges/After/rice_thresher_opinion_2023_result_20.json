Through Nov. 3, you can head to theTexas Medical Centerto cast your ballot — and starting Saturday, Rice will provide bus service from campus. If you can’t make it by then, Sewall Hall will be a voting precinct for Election Day on Nov. 7.\nHouston’s next set of elected officials will inherit the complex issues the city faces today, ranging from public safety to unemployment, potholes, transit and homelessness.\nThe largely Democratic city also faces immense political pressure from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s administration. The Texas Education Agency recentlytook overthe board of the Houston Independent School District, turning someschool librariesinto de-facto detention rooms, and Abbott continues to cynicallytargetelection administration in Harris County.\nThe stakes are high. Will Houston, the fourth-largest city in the country, adjust to itsexplosive population growth, or will its infrastructure give out? Will crime continue to decrease? Will the city build on its progressmoving people off the streets? Will a proposedlight rail linkto Hobby Airport come to fruition? Will Main Street and Rice Boulevard get their potholes repaired?\nThe future of Rice is irrevocably intertwined with Houston. Rice can only afford so many power losses, boil water notices and guns on the street. Our cars can only take so many of those violent bumps.\nOn the mayoral side, incumbent Sylvester Turner is term-limited, with 18 candidates vying to replace him. The two leading candidates are household names in Houston: John Whitmire, a 40-year Texas State Senator from North Houston, and Sheila Jackson Lee, who has represented downtown Houston in the U.S. Congress since 1995.\nIf your Texas voter registration address is on campus, you will also vote for the city council member fromDistrict C, where incumbent Abbie Kamin is facing two challengers.\nAll Houstonians will cast a ballot for the five at-largecouncil members. There are two incumbents and 26 other candidates.\nFinally, there arelocalandstatewideballot propositions regarding hospitals for low-income and uninsured Houstonians, government operations, funding for public education and more.\nIn other words, you, a Houston voter, have a lot of decisions to make. Even if this election season may not have the attention of next year’s presidential election, the issues at hand are just as important.\nLuckily, there is a plethora of information out there. This week, take 30 minutes to research the candidates and propositions and write down your choices. Head to the polls and make your voice heard. The future of Houston — and of Rice — depends on it.\nEditor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Prayag Gordy, Riya Misra, Nayeli Shad, Brandon Chen, Sammy Baek, Sarah Knowlton, Hadley Medlock and Pavithr Goli.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
