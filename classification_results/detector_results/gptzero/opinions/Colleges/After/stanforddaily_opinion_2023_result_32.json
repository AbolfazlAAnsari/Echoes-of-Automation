In the case of Stanford’s administration,leaders saythey care about student well-being, “prioritize student affordability,” and are committed to working with student leadership. However, their actions tell adifferent story: one of a university that prioritizes its own interests over student well-being, especially its graduate students whoseunderpaid laborpowers Stanford’s excellence. We, the Graduate Student Council, haveworkedtirelesslyto advocate for better living and working conditions for all graduate students – frompushing for a salary increasethat outpaces inflation to trying to reinstate twocritical transit linesessential for students to access basic needs and move around campus safely.\nWe have worked hard to build relationships with key offices, such asVPGEandVPSA. We have spent hundreds of hours in meetings and advocacy on students’ behalf. We have convened focus groups to bring your essential voices and concerns directly in front of administrators. We have sacrificedour laborandour time– time that should have been spent furthering our education and research.\nDespite these efforts, how has Stanford responded? Consider a few examples:\nThe “partnership” that we have worked in earnest to cultivate as a Graduate Student Council has been betrayed.The trust is broken.\nWe have often heard that change takes time at a decentralized university like Stanford. Yet, Stanford has had years to address these growing concerns. We are not the first group of graduate students to sound alarms about the crush of living in one of the most expensive places in the world. Every year, Stanford leadership fails to act on these critical issues, effectively punting change to a new cohort of student leaders.It stops with us.\nWe cannot be expected to continually commit to a university that will not commit to us. We have poured our time, effort, and energy into Stanford, andit is time we rise up and demand our needs are taken seriously and prioritized.This letter represents the Graduate Student Council’s vote of no confidence in Stanford’s leadership and demand for tangible changes to be made to improve Stanford’s bureaucratic structure and poor governance.\n– TheGraduate Student Council of 2022-2023\nEmily Schellis a fifth-year PhD student in the School of Education studying Developmental and Psychological Sciences.
