Visitwww.sapaac.orgto find out more about the coalition’s efforts to advocate for Asian American Studies at Stanford. Read previous entries:Fall 2021,Winter 2022,Spring 2022andSummer 2022.\nDuring the fall of 1973, as a freshman living in Arroyo House in Wilbur Hall, I received a form seeking input about activities that might interest me. The survey ended with a request to “rate my Asian consciousness.” This attempt to gauge new students’ interest in Asian American-themed activities was completely lost on me, because I was not yet in tune with my ethnic and cultural identity.\nGrowing up in New Jersey, my childhood friends were descendants of Ellis Island immigrants who came from Europe. I was familiar with the challenges their grannies and papaws had overcome to learn English, establish skills and provide for their families. However, I had no appreciation forthe experienceof tens of thousands of Japanese Americans who had beenforced to leave their homes, friends,land, businessesand belongings inearly 1942. I only vaguely recalled stories from my own cousins about living in horse stalls at theSanta Anita Racetrackor celebrating a new baby sister in barracks amid sagebrush and cactus.\nUnfortunately, Stanford University in the 1970s did not provide much academic education in these matters. Beyond an occasional “study breakbao” at the student-run People’s Teahouse in Junipero — laterrenamed Okada House in 1979— I remained only vaguely aware of our community’s footprint. While I was at Stanford, Asian Americans representedjust 4.9 percentof the undergraduate student body.\nOnly later did I come to appreciate theenormity of the injusticetoward Japanese Americans, through researching my own dad’s story. He sought to avoidincarcerationwith roughly 5,000 other “voluntary evacuees,” escaping from Pasadena to Utah in early 1942, only to be arrested twice and held at theAlien Detention Centerin Missoula, Montana. He was eventually paroled and allowed to return to his life and profession as a photographer.\nMore broadly, thecircumstances Japanese Americans facedwere absurd, and thefrustrationthey endured ininternment campsand alien detention centers was unimaginable. I cannot fathom leaving my home and job withonly a couple of suitcases, and thenreturning years laterto start over — or even journeying somewhere entirely new to create a life for my family.\nIn uncovering the Japanese American story, I encountered two individuals with deep Stanford ties who reinforced institutional racism through actions that seem crazy and loathsome today.\nSeveral of our institution’s early thought leaders, including Stanford presidentsDavid Starr JordanandRay Lyman Wilbur, promulgated the tenets of eugenics. So didDr. Edward Alsworth Ross, a professor of economics and sociology from 1893-1900. Fanning a fear thatAsian immigrationwould ruin the “Anglo-Saxon character of American society,” Ross reportedly suggested that “should the worst come to the worst, it would be better for us to train our guns on every vessel bringing Japanese to our shores than permit them to land.” He waseventually fired, in part for his advocacy of eugenics.\nA proud Stanford alumnus,Colonel Karl R. Bendetsen’29 L.L.B. ’32 — who, interestingly, denied his Jewish faith to join the Theta Delts, andchanged the spellingof his last name from “Bendetson” in 1942 in an attempt to appear Danish — also spearheaded virulent anti-Asian efforts. He is described as the chief architectbehindPresident Franklin Roosevelt’sExecutive Order 9066, which authorized the exclusion of 120,000 Japanese Americans from the West Coast. The sweeping action ordered any person, no matter their age, who had “one drop of Japanese blood” to be confined.\nAll this was unknown to me when I was on campus in the 1970s: there were no Asian American Studies courses. I wish I had been invited to class discussions about America slamming the door onimmigrants from Chinaand preventingJapanese from becoming naturalized citizens. I wish I had been able to learn about Colonel Bendetsen’srolein the mass incarceration of an entire generation living on our West Coast. Instead, I waltzed through much of my life without appreciating these stunning injustices.\nIn 2023, Asian Americans make upmore than one-quarterof undergraduates and19.6% of our overall student body. Our community recognizes the complex history of the Asian American experience, even without being prompted by a student survey. But does Stanford believe the same?\nStudents deserve to learn about the unjust, exclusionist and politically motivated actions — including those initiated by Stanford alumni and faculty — that have impacted Asian American lives and our collective culture.\nIt has been slow going since thefounding of the Asian American-theme dormin 1971, more than 50 years ago — and over25 years since the establishmentof an Asian American Studies program at Stanford. The program was habitually underfunded and neglected, and there were years when the most basic “Introduction to Asian American Studies” course wasnot even offered. Let’s not force students togo elsewhere for Asian American Studieswhen Stanfordhas the potential to createthese learning experiences.\nThis school year, we now have a newAssociate Directorof Asian American Studies. And due in large part to the enthusiasm and generosity of the Stanford Asian American Studies Endowment Initiative (SAASEI), we finally see the University administration, the Office of Development and the School of Humanities and Science collaborating to support a new Asian American research center. This is an amazing start, with the potential to become a robust education and research program — and hopefully a sign that the University now considers Asian American Studies an academic priority.\nThere is much more to be done — and we will be watching closely to see that the University follows through on these efforts and more.
