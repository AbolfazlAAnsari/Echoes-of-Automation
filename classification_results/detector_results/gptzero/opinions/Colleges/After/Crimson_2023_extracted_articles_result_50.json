            "inputText": "At Harvard, the most meaningful government decisions affecting our daily lives happen not in Washington, D.C., but just down the block.\r\nIf you’ve complained about potholes, enjoyed block parties, or ridden on new protected bike lanes, you’ve interacted in some way with Cambridge’s local government. The work that occurs at Cambridge City Hall affects all of us.\r\nYet, on the whole, few people on campus pay any attention. For instance, statistically speaking, if you’re reading this and live in the Quad, the odds that someone in your ward voted in themost recent municipal electionsare about 3/10. If you live in River Central or River West, those odds are closer to 1/10.\r\nThis year, that must change.\r\nCambridge’s upcoming election is an intensely contested one, different from what weusually expectfrom local races. On Tuesday, Nov. 7, Harvard students have the chance to impact the allocation of an operating and capital budget that totals more than $1 billion — money that Harvard students benefit from in the form of the infrastructure we use every day.\r\nIf you care about mobility justice in Cambridge, holding police accountable for their impact on the community, or the prospect of having somewhere affordable to live during graduate school, then this Tuesday must matter.\r\nBoth on and off campus, many of us hold the misguided belief that 2023 is “an off-cycle year” because there won’t be regular federal elections. This view translates into some organizers believing they should spend their time “building relationships and getting everyone ready for 2024.”\r\nThat approach ignores the critical importance of local elections.\r\nThe media and pundits may focus on federal elections, but our votes in those races have little impact. Most Americans live in Congressional districts thatare not competitive. Onlya small proportion live in one of eight states with competitive2024 Senate electionsor one of seven likely to becompetitive in the 2024 presidential election.\r\nPlus, despite the constant attention American society pays to national politics, the reality is that most of us interact with the federal government infrequently. Lawmakers in Washington govern335 million people, while those in Cambridge govern a far smaller population — and have a more direct impact on our lives.\r\nDespite this impact, local elections consistently have weak turnout. On average,just 27 percentof eligible voters participate in municipal elections. In Cambridge in 2021, a mere33 percent of voterscast their ballots to impact city policies.\r\nNew and returning city councilors will decide the fate ofprotected bike lanes,affordable housing,environmental justice,police reform, and more. Every registered voter at Harvard should help ensure the proper governance of this incredible city we call home.\r\nAlthough individual students are relatively transient, as a voting bloc, they comprise around 29 percentof the city’s population. Nonetheless, younger voters participate in local elections at far lower rates than older voters – perhaps because they pay less attention to these races.\r\nYet, a mere185 votesdecided the most recent Cambridge City Council election. We have significantly more power to redefine our city’s future than many believe.\r\nMassachusetts confers college students with the right to vote in the place where we receive our higher education. In many states, like neighboring New Hampshire, conservative governments have enacted laws torestrict students’ right to voteprecisely because of the fear that we will recognize our power and use it. Perhaps we might even disrupt the status quo, shifting power toward candidates who promote policies more oriented toward the needs of young people — a group pretty clearly underrepresented in government.\r\nThis Tuesday, students registered to vote have the unique opportunity to help set our city’s priorities, impact the distribution of hundreds of millions of dollars, and improve the lives of tens of thousands of residents. Let’s not waste this opportunity. This Tuesday, go vote.\r\nClyve Lawrence ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Government concentrator in Adams House. Eamon C. OCearuil ’25 is an Environmental Science and Public Policy concentrator in Lowell House."
