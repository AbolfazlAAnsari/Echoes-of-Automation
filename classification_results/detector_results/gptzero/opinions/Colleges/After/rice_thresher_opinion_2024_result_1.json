Some will be studying for the MCAT, the LSAT or the GRE while simultaneously undertaking other responsibilities like research, an internship or Orientation Week advising.\nThis summer, set aside some time for yourself in the midst of all of your commitments. Take a break. Develop a new hobby, go on a morning hike, sit in some grass — whatever it is, just take some time for yourself.\nWe’ll follow our own advice, too. In the spirit of summer, we’d like to share some of our own plans.\nOne of us will be exploring catacombs in Prague, visiting the Kafka Museum and being very annoying about it. Another one of us will be chugging hotel breakfast smoothies. Some of us will be attending music festivals, singing karaoke at home in Seoul, camping out outside film festivals, perusing coffee shops, adopting cats, looking at mountains, obsessively updating our Letterboxd and — of course —  drunkenly playing golf on the public course. Not that we endorse that, for what it’s worth.\nWhatever suits you best, please take some time for yourself this summer — you deserve it.\nEditor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Riya Misra, Spring Chenjp, Maria Morkas, Prayag Gordy, Sarah Knowlton, Sammy Baek, Shruti Patankar, Juliana Lightsey, Arman Saxena and Kathleen Ortiz.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nWhen I first set foot on the Rice University campus, the contrast with my small hometown of Toomsuba was stark. Moving from a quaint town of 800 people to the big city of Houston, Texas made me realize how large the divide between my experience and that of my peers was.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
