            "inputText": "To our fellow undergraduates,\nNext week,from March 18 to March 22, there will be a question on the UA ballot to adopt a resolution calling for a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, cutting ties between MIT and the Israeli military, and solidarity with student organizers facing disciplinary threats. This question made it on the ballot becausein a ``span of 24 hours, over 600 students (1/8 of the undergraduate population) indicated that they wanted to see this question considered;now, it is time to make our voice heard.\nIf Referendum #2 passes, it will become abinding UA resolution, which means if it passes, the referendum becomes adopted by the UA.It unequivocally demonstrates to the MIT administration that our undergraduate community stands in support of liberation for the Palestinian people—not with those in power who continue the violence in Gaza.\nSo why vote yes on this question?\nWe must call for apermanent ceasefirein Gaza, Palestine.\nSince October 7th, 2023, Israel’s genocidal assault on Gaza has killed an average of 200 Palestinians each day,wiping out entire families. This daily toll isin addition to the 2,270 Palestinians killed by the Israeli militarybetween January 1, 2008 and October 6th, 2023. Since October 7th, Israel’scomplete siege of Gazahas forcibly starved Palestinians in the north of Gaza while those in Rafah, a supposed safe zone in the south, are faced withunrelenting bombings and the threat of a ground invasion. In response to these conditions, the United Nations International Court of Justice hasfound it plausible that Israel’s acts could amount to genocide, and has highlighted the need for an immediate ceasefire.\nEvery person deserves to live a life free from oppression. The Israeli siege on Gaza has denied 2.2 million people a life of dignity by denying themfreedom of movement,basic food security,educational facilities,medical treatment,access to electricity, and aroof to sleep under. Each day, Palestinians in Gaza faceIsraeli snipers, air strikes withincendiary white phosphorusand2,000 pound American-made bombs. Even before the current siege, Palestinians havelong been denied their basic dignity by the Israeli occupation. Our siblings in Gaza have endured over 150 days ofgenocide— it is unconscionable to not take a stand against this wanton violence.\nAnimmediate, permanent ceasefireis the bare minimum the Palestinian people deserve. Our undergraduate student body here at MIT must join the voices of the numerousfaculty,labor unions,cities(including Cambridge), andcountriesaround the world who have already affirmed this need.\nMIT mustcut research funding ties with the Israeli military.\nThis resolution is especially crucial at MIT due to thedirect institutional ties MIT has with the Israeli military.Since 2008, multiple professors in CSAIL, AeroAstro, DMSE, BioE, and other MIT groups haveaccepted research fundingfrom the Ministry of Defense of Israel.This allocated funding has gone towards military research projects such as “Autonomous Robotic Swarms” and “Planning and Sensing Algorithms for Underwater Persistent Monitoring.”Furthermore, at least two PIs at MIT have requested torenewtheir funding with the Israeli Ministry after October 7th, despite mounting evidence that the Israeli military is committing genocide.\nThe work that each one of us does – whether in the classroom, during an internship, as a UROP, or in the world after graduation – builds MIT’s reputation. We came to MIT for a variety of reasons, but certainly none of us came here because we wanted to build an institution which is enabling war crimes. As people of conscience, how can we allow our university to produce work that goes towards enabling military atrocities against the Palestinian people?\nLike our predecessors at MITwho organized in the 60s and 70sagainst the Institute’s role in the Vietnam War, we now are confronted with our own moral reckoning. Our university can no longer produce research that furthers this genocide and oppression against the Palestinian people. MIT has blood on its hands. Rather than consigning ourselves to complicity, we must call for a better society – one where our talents and energies are used in the service of building humanity, not for building bombs.\nMIT must stop attacks against pro-Palestine student organizers.\nFor the last five months, students and organizations in the MIT Coalition for Palestine, including the MIT Coalition Against Apartheid (CAA), have continuously spoken out against the genocide in Gaza and MIT’s complicity in this genocide. The MIT administration, in response topressure from billionaire donorsand right-wing politicians, suspended the CAA and sanctioned individual student organizers for their protests on campus based onadministrative technicalities, in an effort to appease right-wing forces.\nThe policies and rules that the MIT administration isselectively weaponizingagainst pro-Palestine voices are setting a precedent for how MIT deals with any form of student protest, civil disobedience, or speech that substantially challenges the status quo. The MIT community should retain its right to organize and protest on campus. Our campus has a rich and creative tradition of student protest – a tradition that includesboycotts against on-campus housing costs,die-ins for Black lives,stud occupations for anti-war defectors, andshanty-town displays protesting MIT’s support of South African apartheid.\nThe student movement for Palestine will not waver. We will not allow external political pressures to suppress our community’s collective ability to voice our conscience, as we shoulder the collective responsibility to build a better world. In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., let us not use our voice to build an institution that has “guided missiles and misguided men”. Instead, let us vote YES for a ceasefire, YES for ending MIT’s complicity with the Israeli military, and YES for ending the attacks against students on campus that speak up for Palestine.\nTogether, let us use our voice to vote YES because we, as an MIT community strive to make science for liberation, not oppression.\nFor a better MIT and a free Palestine,\nScience for Liberation Campaign Team:\nUndergraduate students,Hannah Didehbani, Amira Ravshanova, and Jonathan Anziani\nThe full resolution text can be viewedhere.\n"
