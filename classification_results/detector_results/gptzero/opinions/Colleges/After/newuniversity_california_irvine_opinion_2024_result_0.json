            "inputText": "Former President Donald Trumpannouncedhis selection of Ohio Sen. James David (J.D.) Vance, age 39, as his vice presidential candidate on July 17 through the Truth Social platform.Vance, elected into office in 2022, entered the American political sphere with a law degree from Yale and a military background. His impressive record is overshadowed by his dedicated loyalty to the former president.\nDespite differences in experience and age, Trump and Vance share identical characteristics ofextremism,bigotryandelection denial. They even share similar speechmannerisms. Ironically, Vance oncecomparedTrump to Hitler, yet his turnaround to being a die-hard defender of Trump ultimately secured his current position as Trump’s vice presidential pick. The striking parallel between both candidates highlights Trump’s rejection of bipartisanship and centrist politics.\nTrump’s choice of Vance as his running mate underscores the former president’s political shortcomings and his unwillingness to consider viewpoints beyond his own, posing a significant threat to our democracy.\nTrump’s vice presidential choice sends an already clear message to Americans: there is no middle ground in his administration.\nTypically, a vice president is strategically chosen by a president to attract voters who might not support them but are influenced to do so because of the appeal of the vice president. For instance, President Joe Biden expanded his voter base by choosingKamala Harris, a young woman of color. Preceding this pick, former President Barack Obama settled concerns about his limited political experience byselecting Biden,who had decades of public service on his record, as his running mate.\nIn contrast, bothVanceandTrumplack substantial political experience and primarily appeal to far-right-wing voters. If Trump was sharper, he could have gone with someone likeNikki Haley, who would have appealed to center-right voters. Additionally, Haley would have attracted votes from women and independentgroupsthat Trump would not reach with Vance.\nSelecting Vance as his vice presidential candidate demonstrates Trump’s lack of strategic vision. He can only find success in feeding the fire of his far-right supporters. By only focusing solely on his fan base, Trump is neglecting the rest of the Republican Party, which is why numerousRepublicanswill be voting blue in November.\nGiven Trump’s history with his former vice president, Mike Pence, who faceddeath threatsfor upholding democratic principles by certifying the 2020 election, it is clear that Trump now seeks absolute loyalty in his close circle. Vance has proved his loyalty by standing alongside Trump,claimingthat his criminal cases are politically motivated and sharing skepticism of the2020 electionresults. This refusal of Trump to share political space with differing viewpoints poses a serious threat to democracy, which relies on compromise and the sharing of power. To further highlight this lack of bipartisanship, both Trump and Vance have expressed a desire to“drain the swamp,”which points to the idea of removing current federal employees and replacing them with like-minded people on the right.\nTrump’s pick of Vance reinforces fears about the future of our democracy. The Supreme Court’sdecisionto side with Trump and allow him on state ballots despite his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection combined with the significant platform given to Vance further fuels growing right-wing extremism. Putting both extremists in power would continue the normalization ofTrumpismand threaten fundamental values such as equality, progress and freedom. Our fragile democracy cannot handle another term of Trump’s rule.\nThe events ofJan. 6were the greatest sign of this pronounced threat to our democracy. Republican state Sen. George Lang’srecent suggestionof a potential civil war if Trump loses the election, combined with Trump’srolein destroying a potential bipartisan border deal, emphasizes the dangers posed by his influence. Additionally, the looming prospect ofProject 2025poses the idea of the government shifting away from bipartisanship and political tolerance under Trump.\nIn today’s tense political climate, the United States needs a president who speaks to all Americans, not just a select group. A quick look at the audience at a Trump rally reveals the limited demographic Trump represents.\nTrump’s extremism will only reach new heights if he once again gains the presidency. Voter turnout against the former president on Nov. 5 is crucial to stop a complete takeover of extremism and to protect our democracy.\nZahira Vasquez is the 2024-25 Assistant Opinion Editor.
