The Trans Coalition is a group of students advocating for gender-affirming care on campus. Coalition speakers said the separate vote on gender-affirming care places extra scrutiny on their community. This visibility increases Trans students’ risk ofharassmentbecause extra attention toward Trans people often leads to discrimination.\nThe current health care plan isnot sustainablewith the present fee, but the plan also does not include comprehensive gender-affirming health care, creating a financial barrier to accessing life-saving care for many Trans students.\nTrans students said separating the two referendum items — and making the item on gender-affirming care conditional on the general fee item passing — implies they should be treated differently than cisgender students by the AMS.\nSome councillors said the two referendum items should be separate because they were asking different things, with one pertaining to a fee increase and the other to adding new coverage. This technicality allowed Council to choose to vote against the wellbeing of Trans students who asked for a single referendum out of visibility and equity concerns.\nThis addition is not merely an expansion of care, but rather an opportunity to fix an oversight in the Health & Dental Plan since the care Trans students need is not already available to them.\nPast changes in coverage to the Health & Dental Plan — like themental healthcoverageincreases — have been passed internally. AMS executives said they can’t make these changes internally right now due to the poor financial health of the Health & Dental Reserve Fund, but rejecting the simple request to combine these two referenda others Trans students.\nThis blatant disregard for the wellbeing of Trans students goes against the AMSEquity Action Plan, which commits to building stronger anti-discriminatory relationships with the 2SLGBTQIA+ community.\nOne of the actions under goal seven in the Outreach, Advocacy + Communication section of the Equity Action Plan states, “Do not burden individuals from [historically, persistently, and systematically] marginalized communities … with the responsibility to speak for their entire community or to educate others on [justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion] issues.”\nIn an effort to appeal to councillors, several Trans Coalition members at the meeting shared their experiences of transphobic harassment and facing barriers to gender-affirming care at UBC and elsewhere.\nWhy did marginalized students need to disclose traumatic anecdotes to convince councillors of the harassment they face? This reveals a failure in how Council handles conversations around the trauma of equity-seeking and marginalized groups.\nBesides the failure to adhere to the Equity Action Plan and inconsistencies regarding when and why changes to the Health & Dental Plan should be brought to a student vote, Council also displayed a lack of empathy toward the Coalition.\nMany councillors pushed back against the group, placing their own views of what Trans students needed above those of the Trans activists in the room. Some councillors even insinuated cis students shouldn’t have to pay for Trans students’ health care — an argument that misses the point of a comprehensive health care plan that all students pay into regardless of whether individual students use all of the available benefits.\nSome councillors also argued adding gender-affirming care to the general fee increase referendum item might cause the proposed fee increase to fail, putting the health care of all students at risk due to the AMS's inability to sustain the plan without a fee increase.\nBut at the same time, Council said they believed the two referendum items would pass individually. These arguments contradict each other. If the AMS believed students would support gender-affirming care as a single item, why wouldn’t they support it while nested within the broader fee increase?\nWhile a few councillors spoke in support of the Trans Coalition, most other councillors either pushed back against the Coalition or remained silent. Council also went into a private, in-camera session for the last 40 minutes of the discussion on whether to combine the referenda, meaning all non-voting members, including the Trans Coalition andThe Ubyssey, were kicked out of the room.\nAfter the in-camera session, Council voted 16–4 against combining the referenda.\nWe can’t know what was discussed during this session, which raises concerns about transparency. Councillors should be required to publicly share their stances on issues that directly affect students who elected them.\nWhen voting in AMS Elections next week, you’ll see two separate referendum items on the ballot. And although this decision is disappointing, know that students advocated for the wellbeing of the UBC Trans community when the AMS wouldn’t.\nIf you are a student looking for gender-affirming care and/or support on campus, consider these resources:\nEditorials represent the opinions of the editorial board ofThe Ubyssey.\nShare this articlecopied!\nUbyssey Editorial Boardauthor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
