Though we agree with the SA that this proposal is far too unrealistic to ever get through Faculty Senate, there is some merit in the intentions behind it.

However, we believe it’s in the best interest of students and faculty alike to consider the effect of student participation in Beer Bike. It is unreasonable to expect that this cultural event, that by its very nature includes large amounts of socializing and a disastrously little amount of sleep, won’t impair academic performances the following Monday.\nIf the faculty’s ultimate goal is to help students learn, they should recognize that students likely won’t do their best work during this time, and having exams or important assignments due at the start of the following week sets students up for failure. We don’t see why professors cannot work around Beer Bike in their syllabi the same way they would (or are supposed to) work around a midterm recess. With that in mind, we also strongly encourage Rice Program Council to decide on Beer Bike timing as early as possible, so that all of campus can prepare in the way we are asking them to.\nWe know that the idea of academics being second to drinking and partying is unfathomable at an institution like Rice. But Beer Bike cannot be equated to deciding to grab a drink at Pub the night before an exam. The latter is pure irresponsibility on the students’ part, while the former is a campus event and tradition that not only enriches the Rice culture, but also expects the participation of all students.\nThe possibility that any student might decide to miss out on this annual experience to not fail an exam or bomb a presentation is a shame that should be avoided at all costs. The idea behind Beer Bike is that literally everybody should participate. We believe faculty should recognize that by designing syllabi accordingly and, when that isn’t possible, be flexible in their deadlines.\nEditor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board.

As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
