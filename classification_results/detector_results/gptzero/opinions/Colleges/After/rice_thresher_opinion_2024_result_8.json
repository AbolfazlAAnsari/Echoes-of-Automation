The presentation was organized by the Rice Center for Engineering Leadership and was attended by approximately 200 guests.\nSome of the guests chose that opportunity to loudly express their opinion contrary to HPE activities in Israel. They screamed the usual themes of genocide, “from the river to the sea,” and similar phrases that have become quite common. Many attendees, including guests from HPE and myself, felt intimidated and threatened by these chants and by the protesters’ attitudes, body language, tone of voice and words. This was certainly not the venue, nor the way to express an opinion about war in Gaza. In public discourse about similar incidents at Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and other schools it became clear to me that these type of slogans (“from the river to the sea,” Israel genocide) are not freedom of speech, but are really hate speech.\nThe silence from Rice leadership, from the president down to the deans and department chairs, is deafening. What happened to the promise to protect Rice students from harassment and threats? Or is Rice leadership only concerned with the perception of free speech and not with the implications of hate speech?\nI understand that the matter was referred to the Rice University Police Department. This is a good step but it does not replace academic and administrative measures that Rice should take against students and student associations and clubs who organize and participate in these demonstrations and blatantly break theCode of Conduct. I expect that hate speech will not be tolerated, and that stark disciplinary action including expulsion or suspension would be imposed on those who ignore it. This is an institutional matter, and I wait for an institutional reply from the Rice president, provost and other authorities.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
