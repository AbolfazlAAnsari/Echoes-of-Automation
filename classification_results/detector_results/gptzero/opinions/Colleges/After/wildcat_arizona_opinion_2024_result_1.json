            "inputText": "The Arizona women’s basketball team is coached by Adia Barnes, and the Arizona men’s basketball team is coached by Tommy Lloyd.\nWith theNBA playoffs less than two months away, we have seen enough basketball to make some projections for how the end of the season will shake out. There are plenty of futures betting markets to take a look at, including division winners, conference winners and, of course, theNBAchampion. All odds presented in this article are courtesy ofDraftKings.\nAlthough these odds do not present too much value, I thinkVegasis siding with the MiamiHeatheavily to win its division for a reason. TheHeatare a team that have been known to pick up its level of play as the season goes on. Led byJimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo, this team has proven over the years that they can compete with any team in the league, as they have made theNBA finals two times in the past four years.\nRight before theall-star break, they added Terry Rozier, who will add a scoring boost for a team that’s weakness comes on the offensive side of the ball. AsRozierbecomes more accumulated into theMiami Heat’ssystem, I predict that this offense will take a big step forward.\nAdditionally, theHeat have the fifth easiest remaining strength of schedule. An experienced team like theHeatwill take advantage of less talented teams. The only competition theHeathave when it comes to winning its division is theOrlando Magic. TheMagicstarted off the season very well, but since the new year, they have been a slightly above average teamwith a record of 16-13.\nTheMagiclack experience and offensive prowess at times, as they rank 22nd in the NBA in offensive rating.TheHeathave struggled with injuries all year,having put out at least  31 different starting lineups this year.They are now starting to get healthier, which solidifies them as the best team in this division.\nThe Dallas Mavericks have the two best players in this division, Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic. The Maverickscould be considered the winners of the trade deadline, as they addedtwo new key pieces to help support Irving and Doncic.TheMavs traded for Daniel Gafford, who is on a shortlist of players that average at least two offensive rebounds and two blocks this season. The only other players on the list areVictor Wembanyama, Rudy Gobert, Anthony Davis, Nic Claxton and Walker Kessler,who are all formidable players in theNBA.\nThe Mavericks also replaced Grant Williams,who reportedly was not loved by his teammates inDallas, withpower forward P.J. Washington. Washingtonis an upgrade fromWilliams, asWashingtonhas averaged11.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 31.9 minutes per game this season. The Mavericksonly competition in theSouthwest Division is the New Orleans Pelicans,who aretwo games ahead of theMavs. Not only are theMavsa better and more talented team, but they also have a much easier remaining schedule.The Pelicans rank in the top 10 when it comes to the hardest remaining schedule. The Mavs rank in the bottom 10. Take the plus odds to the bank and see your bet cashwhen the season comes to an end on April 14th.\n+250is amazing value for the most well-rounded and talented team in theWestern Conference. Tyronn Lue should be given more credit than he is given, as he has figured out a system that allowsJames Harden, Kawhi Leonard and Paul Georgeto play together effectively.Hardenis one of the league’s best facilitators and has proven throughout his career to be one of the greatest scorers this league has ever seen.\nLeonard and George are two of the best two-way players in the league and can both score effectively on all three levels. Their biggest challenge in theWest will be the defending champions the Denver Nuggets. I give theClippersthe advantage in this matchup, as I feel its depth will prevail in a seven-game series.The Nuggets lost Bruce Brown to free agency this season,who played a crucial role in theirNBA Finals run last year. The Clippers‘ role players, Terance Mann, Russell Westbrook and Norman Powell,provide depth for theClippersand will play a key role in theClippers’playoff success.\nThe Boston Celticsare the most complete and talented team in theNBA, which is why I have them winning both theEastern Conference and NBA Finals. You could make an argument that their starting five is the most complete starting five inNBA history.The starting five, which includes two new offseason additions inJrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis, is perfect for the modern-dayNBA.\nOn the defensive side of the ball, they have four amazing perimeter defenders and a rim protector in the middle.Holiday and Derrick White were both All-NBA defenders last year. TheCelticsare the lone team in theNBA with two All NBA defenders from last year.This defensive system has proven to be effective,as they rank 1st in the NBA in defensive rating.\nOffensively, they play with incredible spacingas all of their starters shoot above 34% from the 3-point line. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are two of the best perimeter scorers in the league, both averaging over 22 points per game.The rest of the startersall average in double figures as well,which is very rare and makes them incredibly hard to guard. This floor spacing and talented starting five has allowed them to alsorank first in the NBA in offensive rating. The Celticsalso have experience, asthey made the conference finals in three of the past four years.\nHowever, thisCelticsteam has never been able to get over the hump and win it all. TheCelticsbeing close so many times but not prevailing makes them more hungry than ever.\nTheNBAseason has flown by as we are already past the all-star break. We have now seen enough basketball to make some futures bets and predict the outcome of theNBAseason.\nFollowtheDaily WildcatonInstagramandTwitter/X\n"
