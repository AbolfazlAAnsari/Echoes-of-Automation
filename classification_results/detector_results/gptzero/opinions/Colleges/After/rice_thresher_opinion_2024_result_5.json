We have to be honest — it could have been much worse.\nIn terms ofsome immediate changes: Publics will be allowed to resume, residential colleges must submit plans for promoting Beer Bike week safety and the Martel morning public can occur as a quad-only event (Sundeck, you will be missed). Other implementations include changes to event capacity and ticketing, possible changes to amnesty and other smaller tweaks to current policy. When compared to the fears of a dry campus or forever-cancelled publics that arose last semester, we have to admit that these changes really aren’t that bad.\nIn light of this report, we’re reminded that drinking on campus is a privilege, not a right. These past few months should serve as a lesson, though, and not an excuse to return to last semester’s ways with Beer Bike week approaching. Publics and big events can be taken away from us again just as easily, and we want to be able to both experience and preserve campus culture and tradition.\nAs weurged last semester, it’s still vital to keep drinking safety in mind — especially with the return of publics after an extended hiatus and the fact that Beer Bike is our first major event post-prohibition. It may be easy to get over-excited with a week full of drinking events imminent, but now isn’t the time to go completely crazy. Know your limits, don’t be afraid to utilize resources like caregiving stations and just try to drink responsibly this next week. And, please don’t be afraid to reach out to higher forms of help if you need it — APAC’s intentions were not to scare students off calling REMS when necessary.\nLastly, just look out for yourself and for your friends. We may always joke about the Culture of Care, but it’s real. Make sure your friend has a water bottle, feed them a slice of pizza and have a fun (and safe) Beer Bike — we all deserve it.\nEditor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board.

As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
