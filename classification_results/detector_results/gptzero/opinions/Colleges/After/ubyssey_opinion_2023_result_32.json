You guessed it, Senate does that too!\nBoth the Senate and the Board of Governors operate on a triennial system — this means the bodies operate on three-year long cycles. The majority of senators and governors (with the exception of students) serve three-year long terms, and committees tend to take on long term projects over a period of three years.\nToward the end of each triennium, the Senate undergoes a triennial review, seeking outfeedbackfrom all senators and the wider UBC community to inform how work is done within Senate committees and in the Senate more broadly. By providing feedback, you can change how the Senate operates over the next three years.\nDo you have feedback for Senate?
