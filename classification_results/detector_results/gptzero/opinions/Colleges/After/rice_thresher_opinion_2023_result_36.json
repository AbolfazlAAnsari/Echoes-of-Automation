Maybe because of a superb staff that impresses me every day with their talent and dedication to good journalism or the unwavering support and friendship (and fist bumps) from my co-editor Ben Baker-Katz, but, I think most of all, it is the work I was able to do here.\nWhen I came into Rice, I was pretty positive I wouldn’t be involved in the Thresher. Then, COVID-19 ravaged the globe, and I relocated to my childhood bedroom where there was very little to do outside of write for the Thresher. Let me be honest, I fell in love. In a time where everyone felt disconnected from campus, I somehow felt more connected to all of you than ever.\nIn the years since, I have written stories that meant the world to me. I have articles aboutTitle IX student advocacyanddisordered eatingon my dorm wall. I have (semi-)jokingly remarked that I am on the mental health beat at Rice and written and edited stories about the first-generation low-income student experience and LGBTQ community as a mentally ill, queer FGLI student. The Rice community is small but overflowing with stories worth reading.\nNone of this would have been possible without the trust of our community, so let me thank you. Thank you for trusting the Thresher and myself to tell your stories. I cannot claim to be an unbiased journalist, because no one is. I can say, though, that we strive to make room for the truth, even when the truth isn’t 50/50. It has been the privilege of a lifetime to tell your stories.\nI would be remiss to write this letter without a series of thank you’s to (a few of) the people who made this possible. Thank you to Ella Feldman — I thrive too much on validation, and you encouraging me to keep writing is why I got involved in the Thresher. To Riya Misra, for your friendship, mid-afternoon office gossip sessions and for taking this job next year. To my editor-in-chief Savannah Kuchar. Everything I know about this job, I learned from you. To Katharine Shilcutt for food recommendations, endless encouragement and making each of us better than we would have been without you here.\nThank you to Ben — I love you so much, and I can’t wait to spend less time with you.\nApril is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.\nThe academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.\nS.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
