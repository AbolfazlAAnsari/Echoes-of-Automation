            "inputText": "May 11, 2024\nWritten byHeidi Collie\nHeidi Collie is a London-based freelance journalist with a focus on culture and climate. Heidi graduated from UBC anthropology in May 2023.\n\nHey Siri, play ‘Naive’ by The Kooks\nTo anyone with siblings overseas, this one’s for you.\nI’ve always felt that the international student/parent dynamic gets a lot of airtime in university discourse, with reluctant updates on grades, finances, housing and relationships. But today I want to focus on everyone’s favourite middleman: the sibling you left behind.\nAfter almost two decades of hand-me-downs, comparisons and fights over the front seat of the car, the idea of putting thousands of miles between you and your sibling might have felt like a breath of fresh air. But at some point amid the anarchy of adolescence your relationship transitioned from “I’ll look after them”to “I'll look out for them,” and dare say they became someone hard to live without.\nBetween short holidays, expensive flights and a global pandemic, I barely saw my siblings throughout my degree. Then, following my UBC graduation in May 2023, I found myself in a rocky transition back to life in my home country and these were the three people who helped me without question — with a bed, with a friendship group, with a LinkedIn connection.\nI began navigating the chasm between the girls who had waved me goodbye and the women who now embraced me and realized how much time had actually passed. They aren’t 20, 22 and 24 anymore, they’re 25, 27 and 29 with husbands, houses and kids.\nI had a hunch it would be tough, but I wish someone had warned me justhowtough it was going to be. I wish I knew that I would miss every family event, every Christmas, birthday, funeral, engagement, bachelorette party and the first six months of my nephew’s life. To those of you going through it — I’m sorry to say that it doesn’t get easier, you just stop getting invited. The hard truth is, four thousand miles away, I watched the three of them do their 20s without me.\nAfter six months of playing catch up on the lives of my built-in best friends, I have some humble advice for international students at UBC.\nInitially, all four of us started with handwritten letters. I wouldn’t recommend it. Canada Post is neither cheap nor reliable and there is also no feeling like the betrayal of Google Maps accidentally sending you to Metrotown to mail a letter.\nIt took time, but I eventually figured out that each of my sisters appreciated a different form of communication. For one, it was long  FaceTimes. This was challenging with the time difference but I got into the routine of calling her whenever I was up at night (in an Uber, stumbling back from The Pit or getting ready for my barista opening shift).  Similarly, when she was awake all night in labour, she calledme. For another sister, it was voice notes — the random tangents, intrusive thoughts andboydid she get the business end of those finals-season rants. For the third sister, it was information. I gradually learned that she felt closest to me when she knew what was going on in my life; who's in it, my updates, my plans.\nAs well as finding what works for them, be clear about what works for you. After a drunken cry down the phone to my late-night-FaceTime sister, I was suddenly receiving quarterly care packages full of Terry’s Chocolate Oranges. An absolute win.\nI know, student schedules are hectic, but hear me out. If you can’t manage a recurring video call, I suggest some good old-fashioned habit-stacking.\nTry ‘I’ll send you a voice note every time I walk to Sociology,’ ‘I’ll WhatsApp you my weekly updates when I’m on the 99’ or ‘I’ll FaceTime you each time I take an Uber after dark.’\nYou’d be surprised what a difference this makes.\nEvery time one of my sisters planned a trip to visit me and it got cancelled, it broke my heart.Fantasticif you can manage it, but you’re both probably students or in entry-level jobs so you most likely don’t have two weeks or $1,200 to spare.\nYou’re desperate to show them your new life abroad, I know, but it is so important that you learn to cultivate your relationshipvirtually, and maybe just be happy with this for now.\nThis one, with a massive dose of emotional maturity.You’rethe one making the huge life adjustment I know, but understand that this is going to be complicated for your sibling too. They can love and be proud of you, angry and jealous of you all at the same time. The way they feel might not be as straightforward as you think.\nStay calm when they get it wrong, forget the FaceTime, confuse the time difference or send your gift to the wrong address. Focus on how you can be there without actuallybeing there, keep up to date on their news and remember to ask them about it.\nTruthfully, back home they’re feeling your absence more than you’re feeling theirs.\nFinally, the most fundamental:ownyour decision to leave.\nIn practice, this means that it isyourresponsibility to be proactive, figure out the communication style and fit it into both of your routines — even if your sibling is older, richer, wiser, less busy etc. etc. At the end of the day,youleftthem.\nNot only are they probably being asked about you by random neighbours and distant relatives, but when family issues arise — and they do —you’rethe one away hiking, cycling, skiing, travelling and learning from world-class professors. Your siblings may be picking up the pieces in ways you haven’t seen.\nFor me, this is reminiscent of Jo March in ‘Little Women' (2019) speaking of her youngest sister abroad, “Amy has always had a talent for getting out of the hard parts of life.”\nYour sibling is missing you, but without reaping the rewards of a new life overseas.\nGrowing up, these were the relationships which required no maintenance. Siblings were always justthere— behind you in the car, across from you at the table, in the next bed (or next to you inyourbed if you had a sister as annoying as I was). Unfortunately, with a few thousand miles and the chaos of your early twenties, it doesn’t stay that simple.\nThese are the relationships you’ll have for the rest of your life and it’s important to nurture the connection you spent 18 years building. However, coming from someone who accidentally neglected the importance of this, trust me that nothing is irreparable.\nIt took time to equate the women I see with the girls I knew, but now when they visit me in London, it’s like I never left.\nMy biggest lesson learnt, and the one I give to you today, is that sibling relationshipsdotake work, but that this work will be unconditionally, earth-shatteringly worth it.\nShare this articlecopied!\nHeidi Collieauthor\nPublished bi-weekly in print and daily online, we cover what matters most to UBC students.\nHave feedback?
