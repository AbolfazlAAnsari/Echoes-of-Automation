In response to that decision, Pornhub has pulled out of Texas and is currently inaccessible to users in the state.\nPornhub and other adult entertainment sites are facinglegal challengesafter years of various misconduct allegations. Since 2020,over 2.3 million people have signed a petition to shut down Pornhubover sex trafficking and other criminal concerns.\nSarah Sowell, who is studying political science and social policy analysis, has worked for the anti-trafficking groups Allies Against Slavery and Demand Disruption. Sowell said she believed that porn’s harmful association with trafficking and child endangerment has not been confronted enough in the legislature.\n“It makes me wonder how much of Pornhub's revenue is coming from children if it's so important to them that they not have [...] an arduous age verification process, [that] they'll just pull out,” Sowell, a Jones College senior, said.\nPornhub cited the“ineffective, haphazard and dangerous”Texas law for age verification as their reason for leaving Texas.\nAfter Pornhub’s retreat, Paxtoninitiated legal proceedingsagainst the owners of two other pornography websites, Chaturbate and xHamster, for alleged violations of H.B. 1181. They may now face millions of dollars in civil penalties of “up to $10,000 per day, an additional $10,000 per day if the corporation illegally retains identifying information, and $250,000 if a child is exposed to pornographic content due to not properly verifying a user’s age.”\nHowever, even this reason brings into question what legal policies can and should be implemented to hold explicit websites accountable without infringing on rights of both companies and consumers, something that Sowell touched on.\n“I think it's good to talk about these things and to really ask ourselves [about how] easily accessible video pornography has been around for at least 20 years, and I don't think there's been as much of a policy reckoning as there should be about its normativity,” Sowell said.\nHarm to actors in the porn industry or those outside the industry who have videos of themselves nonconsensually postedhas been a motivator of the backlash against Pornhuband similar websites in previous years, in addition to the newer concern around the issue of minors’ access to the sites. Previously, in 2021,Pornhub was forced into expanding moderatoration and adding safety measures including a third party systemto verify identity of uploaders after controversy over allegations of monetizing rape, revenge porn and content of children.\nThe 2023-2024 co-director of the Rice Women’s Resource Center, Gillian Gravatt, said she felt that mainstream porn often does not have women’s wellbeing in mind.\n“Young people, regardless of gender, getting their information about sex via this type of porn is really damaging because it's not what sex is like, and it's not what sex should be like,” Gravatt, a Martel College junior, said. “I think there's a big gap in terms of this — it could be an opportunity for someone to fill in this gap and introduce sex and sexual health to minors in a more productive way in terms of [sexual education] curriculums that are more comprehensive and inclusive, but that’s not going to happen.”\nGravatt said comprehensive sexual education will not likely occur due to the political motivations behind H.B. 1181.\n“There's this broader political thing that Republicans in Texas are doing with this idea of obscenity and what children are allowed to see. And it's a lot of similar reasoning that they're using to prevent children from being exposed to queer education and drag shows and things that don't [fall] under my definition of obscenity,” Gravatt said. “So it's difficult, because I have to look at this decision in light of that broader context, but I also don't think that minors should have access to pornography necessarily, but for different reasons than why this law was passed.”\n“I think it's a very fine line [between censorship for safety and health and censorship that impinges on freedom of speech],” Gravatt continued.\nThe case cited in the Appeals Court’s decision isGinsberg v. New York, which itself upheld a New York statute forbidding the sale of obscene magazines to minors — thus providing a legal precedent to use for constitutionally denying minors access to any material that could be deemed “harmful to minors.”\nHowever, ethical and legal discussion aside, motivated people will always find a loophole: Google searches for ‘Texas VPNs’ roseby more than 1,700%in the days following Pornhub’s withdrawal.\nJeremy Zucker’s arms, like most of his body, host a scrapbook of tattoos — a faded clementine peel, his childhood pets (Rusty and Susie), a Pinterest doodle of Sonic the Hedgehog with a bouquet of flowers. His middle finger is etched with a single tooth, hanging off a thin branch wrapping around the rest of his hand.\nA former American president, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Nobel laureates and the founder of Khan Academy. All may share similar traits or levels of fame, but there’s another, quieter, common ground: They’ve all spoken at Rice’s commencement.\nPeggy Whitson has spent more time in space than any other American. She was the first female, nonmilitary Chief of the Astronaut Office for NASA and the first woman commander of the International Space Station, but despite all her success, Whitson denies any claims of special talent or giftedness. Above all else, she said, hard work and perseverance brought her to the top.\nPlease noteAll comments are eligible for publication byThe Rice Thresher."
