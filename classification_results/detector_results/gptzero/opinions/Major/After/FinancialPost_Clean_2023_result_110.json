Though it hasn't received much coverage on this side of the Atlantic we would all do well to pay attention. The worrying incident at the centre of the scandal - what's now known as \"de-banking\" - looks a lot like a kind of cancellation increasingly common here in Canada.The scandal involves British politician and media personality Nigel Farage, formerly head of UKIP, the U.K. Independence Party, and a leader of the Yes side in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Earlier this summer, Mr. Farage announced that his bank - Coutts &; Co - had notified him his account was being terminated. He made an issue of this in public, suggesting the closure was politically motivated. The bank denied it, going so far as to claim the actual reason was that he didn't have enough money in the account. But eventually Mr. Farage was proven right. He got his hands on internal communications showing Coutts was closing his account because his political positions didn't \"align with their values.\"What followed was the resignation of Alison Rose, CEO of NatWest Group, the parent company of Coutts, quickly followed by the departure of Peter Flavel, CEO of Coutts. Even U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak became involved and is now considering new regulations that would prevent banks from denying customers service due to their politics. Farage was ultimately offered his Coutts account back, but he has not yet clarified if he will accept the offer to keep his accounts open. He has made clear, however, that he sent a legal litigation letter to Coutts demanding full apologies and compensation for his costs.This whole episode should raise alarm bells for all of us. The idea of banks, which are key institutions of modern life, becoming ideological actors and deciding to deny service to otherwise eligible individuals because of their political opinions is more than a little disconcerting.Of course, banks are already engaging in forms of cancellation that are not unlike what happened to Mr. Farage. Financial institutions, including banks, now regularly decide to stop investing in or providing services to oil and gas companies, both in order to appeal to climate activists and to improve their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores with environmentalist and other advocacy groups.InvestNow, the organization I head, has stepped up and presented shareholder proposals to Canadian banks to counter these prosperity-destroying campaigns, whose ultimate objective is to shut down Canada's oil and gas industry. We are the first to present such proposals to Canada's banks.
