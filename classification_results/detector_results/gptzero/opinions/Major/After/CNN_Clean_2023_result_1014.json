As the Amnesty report notes, \"Known executions, excluding the thousands believed to have taken place in China, significantly increased by 53% on those for 2021, from 579 (2021) to 883 (2022).\"This is why I have been following Singapore'sfrequent use of the death penaltywith growing concern. Since resuming executions in March 2022 (following the height of the Covid-19 pandemic), Singapore has executed 16 individuals -all for drug offenses.The most recent executions of three prisoners for small-scale drug trafficking -including the hanging in July of a womanfor the first time in nearly 20 years - are deeply worrying.The country's heavy-handed approach raises important moral and ethical questions, while doing little to deter crime or make Singaporeans safer than they already are.Research from Amnesty Internationalfound no evidence that the death penalty deterred crime more than life imprisonment.The truth is that capital punishment is not an inevitable part of Asia's political and judicial reality. Ending it is not an imposition of Western values on our societies. It's a choice inspired by universal human rights - one that has been made bythe majority of the world's nations.When I became Mongolia's president, five crimes were eligible for the death penalty: two forms of terrorist attacks, sabotage, rape and aggravated murder. Predictably, ending the death penaltydid not bring about waves of violent crimein Mongolia. Homicide rateshad already been falling, and they continued to fall. In fact, crime seemed not to be affected at all by abolition, suggesting that the executions never had a deterrent effect to begin with.While my experience has led me to oppose the death penalty under any circumstances, I find its continued use to punish nonviolent drug offenses in Singapore especially egregious. It is an excessive response to challenges that are best addressed by policies focusing on harm reduction and public health, rather than punishment.Targeting those at the bottom of the illicit drug trade's supply chain is particularly problematic, asmany are coerced into doing what they doand are easily replaced by others in case of arrest. Hanging drug traffickers will not solve the bigger issues. It also puts Singapore out of step with neighboring countries - Thailand decriminalizedthe use of cannabis, andMalaysia has introduced legislationto follow suit.I agree with many others who have pointed out that Singapore has done well in many other respects and made smart choices that have had significant impact on both crime and drug use. Its investments in world-class education, health care and infrastructure have contributed tostability and prosperity.Singapore has a highly educated and skilled workforce, and a Singaporean passport ranks amongthe most desirable travel documents in the world. There's much to be proud of. Singapore undoubtedly has a strong national brand.But brands must be carefully managed. The global attention drawn to Singapore's execution spree over the last 12 months has prompted many of its citizens to ask why they should hold on to a brutal and ineffective form of punishment, despitegrowing evidence that it is causing more harm than good. While themajority of Singaporeans still state that they support the death penalty,a 2018 studyfound that \"there was a much lower support for the death penalty when respondents were faced with scenarios of cases ... particularly so for drug trafficking.\"The Singaporean government meanwhileremains adamantthat capital punishment works to deter drug traffickers and maintain public safety. In aletter to The Atlanticearlier this year, Singapore's ambassador to the United States, Lui Tuck Yew, wrote: \"Other countries can decide on the approach that best suits them. Our approach has saved countless lives and made Singapore one of the safest places in the world.\"While President Tharman has not shared his views on capital punishment publicly, he noted his support forgiving people \"second, third and fourth chances\"at a forum last month - perhaps opening the door for a reversal to the government's hard-line policy.We all share a sincere desire to see our nations continue to prosper. Singapore will be better off without the death penalty.Opinion by Elbegdorj TsakhiaTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
