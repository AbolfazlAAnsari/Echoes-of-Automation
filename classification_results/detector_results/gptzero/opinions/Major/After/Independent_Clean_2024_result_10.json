Despite this colossal growth, we still don’t fully understand the humanhealth impact of consuming plastic, how far plastic particles spread or how they accumulate in the body.Scientists aren’t the only ones who are worried. Our petition calling for urgent funding for more research has received over 100,000 signatures so far.There is no lack of scientific will or ingenuity in this area, and the pathways to real breakthroughs are clear. But there is nowhere near enough public and private funding to ensure scientists can do this urgent explorative work.That’s why today we’re calling for urgent funding to help the world’s scientists get to the truth on plastic and its effects on the human body.Jo RoyleFounder & CEO, Common Seas"
