While the customers suffer from a failing water system and a lack of planned improvements.Keith PooleBasingstokeInject some realism into our debatesWhile accepting there is a need to be seen (and to act) as a“humane and welcoming” countryI note a determination from some contributors to overlook the savage reality of ourfinancial woes as a nation.Indebted to a catastrophic degree, with a terrifying inability to care forthe health and social needsof both young and old, this country is clearly in no position toadd to the pressurewith an open-door immigration policy.We can all variously point the finger of blame at the Tories, Brexit, Kier Starmer, Liz Truss, Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak etc... but us critics take potshots from the safety and comfort of our sofas. We will never have to sign a critical document or tackle huge and complex humanitarian problems. So it’s easy for us to judge, we don’t carry the can.Opinions, theories and political ideals have no impact there. Only hard, cold facts. And while we all dream of a world we’d like to see,the numbers generated by researchshould be a starting point for all conversations. We must be prepared to inject some realism into our debates. Wanting to blame Tories for the current maelstrom is a popular past time, but do we just want a windmill to tilt at? And, right or wrong, we all need to find someone else to blame, don’t we?Steve MackinderDenverIs Starmer trying to dismantle the British left?Keir Starmer’s blocking ofJeremy Corbyn’s Labour candidacyat the next general election looks to me like the latest in a series of attempts to dismantle the British left forever.Starmer’s actions are more reminiscent ofMargaret Thatcherthan they are of any Labour leader in history. He seriously underestimates Corbyn’s popularity, and thecommitment of traditional Labour votersto a socialist agenda, in doing so.Quite apart from the moral difficulty presented by this ignominious and wholly unnecessary action, this latest ploy of Starmer’s shows him to be an autocraticpersonality whoseintegrity – remember him referring to Corbyn as his “friend”? – is seriously wanting.This deserves to have seriously adverse ramifications for him at the ballot box.I have voted Labour all my life but resigned in protest in 2020 asStarmer withdrew the whip from Corbyn.  This is not just due to Starmer’s actions as far as the left generally and Corbyn specifically are concerned, but because – again, invoking Mrs Thatcher – it must not be forgotten that, when asked what her greatest legacy was,she replied: “New Labour.”Keir Starmer may well be on his way to delivering this toxic legacy in Thatcher’s name for a second time but, if his track record is anything to go by, the consequences of doing so will be far worse than anything we saw under Tony Blair. It is the travesty ofThatcherismre-packaged in Labour branding, from which we must be delivered.Michael WaltonAddress Supplied"
