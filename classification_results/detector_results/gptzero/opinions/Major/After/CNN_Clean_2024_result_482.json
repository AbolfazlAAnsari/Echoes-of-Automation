Most women, even the most feminist among us, engage with a system that rewards youth and beauty in women in a way it simply doesn't with men: We wear makeup, pick out flattering (by which we mean slimming) clothing and dye out the grays in our hair.

She no longer fit the virginal image the pageant wanted, and so they punished her for it. It took them more than 30 years to apologize.The pageants have made some changes to adapt to the modern world.Miss USA contestantsno longer have to be unmarried, under 28, never divorced, childless and not pregnant. The opportunity to be judged as the most beautiful gal on stage now extends to a wider variety of women - a complicated kind of progress indeed. And participants remain quite constrained in what they can do or say once they've been crowned by the organization, which is precisely why we know so little about these latest resignations.Despite the nondisclosure agreements, whispers are getting out about why Miss USA in particular may have stepped down, includingmistreatment by pageant higher-ups.(The Miss Universe organization has not returned CNN's request for comment.) Fans noticed that the first letter in the first 11 sentences of Voigt's resignation statement spell out \"I am silenced.\"Every woman deserves to be treated with dignity and respect in her workplace, even if that work involved evening gowns and bathing suit competitions. But the kind of treatment it's suggested she endured simply isn't all that surprising given the ethos of pageants themselves. When women and girls are treated like objects to judge and ogle, smiling and (apart from a brief interview) largely silent, is it really so surprising that those who run pageants may not treat young women like autonomous human beings worthy of respect and freedom?I hope Miss USA and Miss Teen USA are able to speak out about whatever it is they experienced. But I also hope this is the beginning of the end of those titles and these sexist, silly contests.Opinion by Jill FilipovicTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
