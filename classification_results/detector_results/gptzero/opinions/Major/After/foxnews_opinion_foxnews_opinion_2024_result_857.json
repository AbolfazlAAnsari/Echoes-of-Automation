Each is a testament to the enduring power of art to capture the profound truths of the Gospel narrative, challenging us to engage the heart together with the mind.This is the inspiration behind the Museum of the Bible’s exhibit \"Ecce Homo: Behold the Man.\" The exhibit’s 21 pieces – including a piece by Salvador Dalí – offer a different artist’s interpretation of the concept of suffering.WHAT IS GOOD FRIDAY? EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOWSome elegant and beautiful, others surreal and haunting, each painting causes us to imagine the deeper spiritual realities behind what Christ went through on Good Friday. Or, in the words of hymn writer Stuart Townsend, to \"Behold the man upon the cross, my sin upon his shoulders.\"The crucifixion story confronts us with the humanity of Christ – his vulnerability, his anguish, his willingness to endure suffering for the sake of love. These are profoundly human experiences and emotions, things all of us are familiar with. That’s why Isaiah prophesied that Jesus would be \"a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.\"Good Friday, however, isn’t only about Jesus. We have a part to play.WHY GOOD FRIDAY OFFERS ‘THE BEST NEWS EVER’ FOR EASTER AND ALWAYSIsaiah goes on to saywhyJesus suffered: \"Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.\"Like our exhibit’s 21 artists who paint to find a reflection of ourselves in Jesus, Isaiah leads us to see ourselves in the story. He is reminding us that Christ didn’t go to the cross for himself – he went for us.That isPaul’s message to believersin the book of Romans when he writes, \"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\" Jesus knew we couldn’t come to him, so in the incarnation, he came down to us even though he knew it would cost him his life.On Good Friday, we behold the man – we relate to Jesus’ humanness.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONBut if that was the whole story, we’d have no reason to call Good Friday good. If Jesus was only human, we’d have no cause to hope because he would just be another of death’s victims. But it isn’t the whole story. Three days later, Christ did something else for us:  He rose from the grave.On Easter,we behold the risen man– we stand in awe of Christ’s divinity.Christ’s divine nature accomplished that which human nature by itself cannot; it defied death. That’s why Easter is the day of triumph.The resurrection demonstrated beyond any doubt that Jesus was who he said he was: the Son of God. But it did something else as well. It fulfilled God’s promise of redemption.It is the contrast between Good Friday and Easter Sunday that helps us grasp the weight andwonder of Christ’s passion. We will truly understand the triumph and glory of the resurrection when we have also walked with Christ through the depths of His suffering, only when we \"behold the man.\"CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM HARRY HARGRAVEGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
