They were escaping war, and were not economic immigrants being falsely labeled as asylum seekers by the Biden administration.The attitude of Harrisonburg to its role as an immigrant refuge displays an important nuance within the raging and often volatile arguments about immigration and the border. Very few people are flat out against immigration. Even Donald Trump extols the virtue of new arrivals when it is done in the right way.The New Bridges Immigrant Resource Center in Harrisonburg, Va., deals mainly with refugees from Afghanistan and other areas where asylum seekers face danger.(David Marcus/Fox News Digital)This is the same attitude that I found in Del Rio, Texas, which bears so much of the brunt of our broken border system. Not only were many of the border agents I spoke with of Mexican descent, they openly told me their parents or grandparents had come illegally. They don’t hate illegal immigrants, they just want a clear system to enforce.American voters by and large are not anti-immigrant. They are frustrated by an immigration system that simply pushes people off of a bus in New York City or somewhere and throws them in a hotel and says, \"Go figure it out.\"They also understand the danger of an immigration system that creates isolated communities which do not lead to assimilation, but rather Balkanization.

Harris can win votes by calling Trump and his supporters anti-immigrant racists.

They want our nation to remain the shining city upon a hill, but they want it done in a way that is well organized. As Jeff put it to me, \"Are we really helping these illegal immigrants if we don’t have a system in place? Or are we setting them up for failure?\"In a nation as divided as ours, it is worth paying attention when people on both sides agree on something. I wasn’t expecting to find that in Harrisonburg, but as always, this land of ours is full of wonderful surprises.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID MARCUSDavid Marcus is a columnist living in West Virginia and the author of \"Charade: The COVID Lies That Crushed A Nation.\""
