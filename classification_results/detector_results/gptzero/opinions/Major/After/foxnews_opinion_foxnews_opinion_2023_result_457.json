There is little information on the long-term effects from a large initial exposure, as potentially received from the wreck, and whether the controlled burn will result in lingering noxious substances.The controlled burn and monitoring levels being reported are reassuring that this level of massive exposure to vinyl chloride is less going forward.However, the metabolites of the exploded chemical may still be present.The EPA says it’s monitoring two other chemicals, phosgene and hydrogen chloride, which may have been released into the air by the controlled burn from the breakdown of vinyl chloride. Those substances themselves are highly toxic.The trench that the chemical was burned in was lined with porous soil. The EPA says they are trying to clear out the contaminated soil however spread is inevitable.For now, the EPA and local authorities are offeringin-home air monitoring, well water testing and other services free of charge. How long that will last is anyone’s guess.Ensuring clean air, water and food are basic essentials to everyday life.  Norfolk Southern and the EPA owe it to these victims to provide them for life, not short-term.Monitoring and continuing \"to work with\" are nice but residents living near thesite of the derailmenthave good reason to be concerned about how safe their community is and may have been told it was safe to return too soon.The immediate danger may now be less, but the potential for long-term devastation remains high.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.
