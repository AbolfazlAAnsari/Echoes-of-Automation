Republican abortion bans have made these statesextremely hostile to health workers, especially those specializing in women's health, OB/GYN, and obstetrics.Doctors in anti-abortion states now face serious civil and criminal penalties if they make treatment decisions that conservative legislators have outlawed - including treatments that are standard in places where abortion is legal, such asmiscarriage management, procedures to end life - andhealth-threatening pregnancies, and treatments forectopic pregnancies. And doctors are people, many of them of reproductive age, or parents of children who will eventually be of reproductive age. Who can blame them for refusing to put their lives, livelihoods and freedom at risk by living and practicing medicine in states with laws that ban abortion, threaten doctors and risk women's livesin the name of \"pro-life\" politicsAs a result of abortion bans, somedoctors are fleeing conservative statesand health clinics areshutting their doors. Many of these states were alreadystrugglingwith health care shortages and major health care challenges. Now, women have fewer options for care: nowhere to get a safe abortion, and fewer and fewer options for gynecological care, emergency care and childbirth.Women and children in conservative \"pro-life\" states are alsoworse off by a variety of measures. Children in these states are more likely to live in poverty. Women are more likely to die in pregnancy, childbirth or soon after.  Women and their children areless healthy. These are the conditions that anti-abortion Republican politicians have failed to correct, or even helped to create.So, it is perhaps no surprise that Republicans are also refusing to make it easier for women to prevent unintended pregnancies, at the same time as they are making it harder for women to end unintended pregnancies. But it is shameful. It should be scandalous. And it serves as further proof that the right-wing opposition to abortion is not about saving lives or protecting women. It's all about making women's lives smaller and making all of us less free.Opinion by Jill FilipovicTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
