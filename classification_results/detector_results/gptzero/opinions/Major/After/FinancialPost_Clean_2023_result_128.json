And what is the federal government's latest response? A new tax that will increase the cost of giving and drive donations even lower. The proposal should be scrapped.The percentage of Canadians who donate to charities has been dropping for more than 30 years. Earlier this year, CanadaHelps(https://www.canadahelps.org/en/ ) (drawing on its own research as well as that of other charitable organizations, including Imagine Canada(https://www.imaginecanada.ca/en)) reported(https://indd.adobe.com/view/1fdaa5b9-65af-4325-86e2-628a1f02d797) that the donor participation rate dropped from 29.5 per cent in 1990 to just 18.4 per cent in 2020 - a decrease of close to 40 per cent - with almost half the decline occurring over the last 10 years.Even with this substantial decline, however, the total of donations from individual Canadians continues to grow. Why? Because donors aged 55 and over and those in the highest-income tax bracket are giving larger annual amounts. Charities are relying on an ever-smaller number of donors who are increasingly generous.At the same time, the services provided by charities have become more critical. The CanadaHelps report states that 22 per cent of Canadians expect to rely on charities for basic needs such as food and clothing, with four in five citing inflation as the major culprit.Inflation has also made it harder for many charities to deliver their services: 80 per cent told CanadaHelps that it has increased their staffing and other service delivery costs. With securing donation revenue becoming more challenging and both demand and costs rising, it is not surprising that more than 57 per cent of charities say the demand for their services exceeds their capacity to deliver them. What would the federal government do in response? Introduce tax changes that will deliver yet another blow to the charitable sector.Because of concerns that some taxpayers may take advantage of too many deductions, exemptions and credits - even if perfectly legally - our tax code includes a minimum tax allowing fewer carve-outs than are available under the regular rules. For example, the minimum tax includes 80 per cent of capital gains in income, versus only 50 per cent under the regular rules. The minimum tax rate is 15 per cent, and if the taxpayer owes more under the minimum tax than under the regular calculation, he or she has to pay the difference.The government plans to re-vamp the minimum tax and include many more adjustments, effective in 2024. The Parliamentary Budget Officer estimates that the changes will raise about $600 million a year and will be paid by about 26,000 individuals. As Jamie Golombek wrote(https://financialpost.com/personal-finance/taxes/new-alternative-minimum-tax-rules-donating-more-charity) in FP last week, these changes could substantially raise the tax cost of certain large charitable donations.For example, under the regular rules individuals who donate publicly-listed securities to charities receive a donation credit based on the market value of the shares and are exempt from any tax on the accrued gain. Under the new minimum tax rules, 30 per cent of the gain will be included in adjusted income and the donation credit will be limited to one-half. As a result, a hefty amount of tax may apply.The government says the changes are needed to ensure the wealthiest Canadians pay their fair share of taxes. Nonsense! Canada's personal tax rates for high-income earners are among the highest in the world. In Ontario, for example, the federal-provincial tax rate is 53.5 per cent for those with annual income above $235,000. And the tax preferences being over-ridden by the minimum tax were enacted for good reason, as part of sensible tax policy - in the case of donations of publicly-traded securities, to encourage philanthropy.Worried about grocery prices?

The structural issues Canadian charities are facing - a declining donor base, increased demand for services, and scarce resources - are challenging with no easy answers. Higher taxation on donations is the last thing the sector needs.Allan Lanthier, retired partner of an international accounting firm, has been an advisor to both the Department of Finance and the Canada Revenue Agency. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
