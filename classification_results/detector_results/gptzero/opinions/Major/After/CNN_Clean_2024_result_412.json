As is typical when I sing nigunim, I went home that day feeling spiritually rejuvenated, but, unlike usual, most of those singing with me that day were not Jewish.That's because both Jewish and non-Jewish students, inspired byanti-Apartheid protestsin Beinecke Plaza decades earlier, had gathered for a week-long sit-in to demand that Yale divest the portion of its endowment invested in the stocks ofmilitary contractors, which make the weapons Israel is currently using in its war with Hamas in Gaza. The students were protesting under the Occupy Beinecke coalition, which includes Yale Jews for Ceasefire, a group of Jewish students dedicated to fighting for a ceasefire in Gaza as well as sustainable peace and equality within the region.In light ofstudent arrestsMonday morning - along with similararrests at Columbialast week - campus clashes and concerns around antisemitism are once again in the news.I do not deny that there has been a shocking and upsetting rise in antisemitism over the last few months, including several instances of antisemitism right at Yale and in New Haven. Last fall, one professor's post on X (formerly Twitter) appearing to praise Hamas' October 7th attack sparked a petition for her to be fired.I have had countless painful conversations with close friends trying to explain to them how their rhetoric has at times minimized the killing and hostage-taking of Israeli Jews and how that language hurts their Jewish classmates, myself included.But when people see pro-Palestinian protesters arrested at the same time asPresident Joe Bidenandothersare warning about a surge of antisemitism on college campuses, they apply the same tired framework - supposedly antisemitic pro-Palestine activists pitted against Jewish pro-Israel activists - to Yale.

We were demanding that Yale call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and commit to protecting campus free speech after Columbia Universitybanned pro-Palestinian student groups. This semester, students have gathered weekly on Friday afternoons in Beinecke Plaza as Jewish classmates led even more singing and prayer in protest of the war in Gaza.Throughout this past week, large student groups of many faiths frequently joined in singing \"Mi Shebeirach,\" the Jewish prayer for healing, and \"Olam Chesed Yibaneh,\" which calls for building a world where compassion leads.

To see Yale protests once again swept up in accusations of antisemitism denies this experience and invalidates the Jewishness of those calling for an end to the violence in Gaza.Indeed, Yale Jews for Ceasefire exists because of - not in spite of - our Jewish values.
