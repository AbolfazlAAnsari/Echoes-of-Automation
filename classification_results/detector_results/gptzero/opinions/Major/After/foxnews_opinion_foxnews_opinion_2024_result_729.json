Who exactly was the Council voting to \"recognize\" and give full membership status to?But, above anything else, a very important principle stated in Article 4 of the U.N. Charter is, \"Membership in the United Nations is open to allpeace-lovingstates.\"If the U.N. can’t prevent wars or defend human rights, it has lost any reason to exist.Does anyone doubt that the Palestinians fail to meet these criteria? Did anyone hear any Palestinian leader even condemn themassacre of Israeli children?In every poll, even those conducted by the Palestinians, the vast majority of Palestinians support Hamas and continued terror against Israelis.THE SECURITY COUNCIL REVIVES THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY’S UN HOPES. THE US SAYS NOT YETThe Palestinian Authority is the opposite of a \"peace-loving\" entity.The Palestinian Authority not only have not condemned the October 7th Massacre, they are also paying monthly salaries to all the terrorists that took part in it, rewarding the rapists.This is a genocide-loving entity that does not deserveanystatus at the U.N.But sadly, for theSecurity Council, the Palestinians' inability to meet the criteria simply does not matter. The U.N. Charter is important to them only when it can be used against Israel. In other words, the U.N. Charter be damned. International law be damned.What this Council has decided to focus on is granting a prize to terrorists. Granting the perpetrators and supporters of October 7th full membership status in the U.N. is the vilest reward for the vilest crimes.The only thing that a forced, unilateral recognition of aPalestinian Statewould do is to make any future negotiations almost impossible. As long as the Palestinians feel that they can exploit this politicized body to their benefit, why would they bother at the negotiating table or support any compromise?PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY FORMS NEW CABINET FOLLOWING WORLDWIDE CALLS FOR GOVERNMENT REFORMThe Palestinians have rejected every peace plan ever made and they continue to support terror and boycott negotiations. And now they know that their rejectionism pays off.They can say no, no, no, but still get what they demand, because the U.N. is guided by politics, not morality or truth.All the Security Council is \"accomplishing\" through this destructive approach, is making a solution to the conflict unattainable.The U.N. is no longer about multilateralism, sadly. It is now committed to multi-terrorism.The only thing that a forced, unilateral recognition of a Palestinian State by the United Nations would do is to make any future negotiations almost impossible.(Photo by MPI/Getty Images)CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONAnd if the U.N. can’t prevent wars or defend human rights, it has lost any reason to exist.The day will come when it will be shuttered. The U.N., as we know it, will cease to exist and in its place will stand a body that truly cares about human rights. That truly fights to promote peace. That is capable of putting politics aside, for the sake of justice, morality, and humanity. And when that day comes – and it will – the meeting and subsequent vote to force the establishment of a Palesti-Nazi state will be remembered as catalysts of the UN’s collapse.A meeting where the world burned, but all that concerned the Security Council was helping terrorists in Gaza survive.A meeting where a terror entity could be given full membership status. This is how far the UN has fallen. And this is why the UN – in its current format – has no future.I truly pray for brighter days. For a time when the U.N. can successfully combat the forces of darkness, not welcome them and be influenced by them.Gilad Erdan is Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations.
