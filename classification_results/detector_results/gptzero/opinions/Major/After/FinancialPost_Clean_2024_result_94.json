Unfortunately, he made several misleading claims while failing to acknowledge the harmful effects this tax increase will have on a broad swath of Canadians.It's time to change the capital gains tax. Here's why: pic.twitter.com/a1X1z8rFTu(https://t.co/a1X1z8rFTu)- Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) May 13, 2024(https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1790021255845773705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)Right now, individuals and businesses who sell capital assets pay taxes on 50 per cent of their gain (which is taxed at their full marginal rate). Beginning on June 25th, however, the Trudeau government will increase that share to 66.7 per cent for capital gains above $250,000. People with gains above that amount will again pay their full marginal rate, but now on two-thirds of that segment of their gain, not one-half.In the video, which you can view online, the prime minister claims that this tax increase will affect only the \"very richest\" people in Canada and will generate significant new revenue - $20 billion, according to him - to pay for social programs. But economic research and data on capital gains taxes reveal a different picture.For starters, it simply isn't true that capital gains taxes only affect the wealthy. Many Canadians who incur capital gains taxes, such as small business owners, may only do so once in their lifetimes.For example, a plumber who makes $90,000 annually may choose to sell his business for $500,000 at retirement. In that year, the plumber's income is exaggerated because it includes the capital gain rather than only his normal income. In fact, according to a 2021 study(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/correcting-common-misunderstandings-about-capital-gains-taxes.pdf) published by the Fraser Institute, 38.4 per cent of those who paid capital gains taxes in Canada earned less than $100,000 per year, and 18.3 per cent earned less than $50,000. Yet in his video, Prime Minister Trudeau claims that his capital gains tax hike will affect only the richest \"0.13 per cent of Canadians\" with an \"average income of $1.4 million a year.\"But this is a misleading statement. Why? Because it creates a distorted view of who will pay these capital gains taxes. Many Canadians with modest annual incomes own businesses, second homes or stocks and could end up paying these higher taxes following a onetime sale where the appreciation of their asset equals at least $250,000.Moreover, economic research(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/correcting-common-misunderstandings-about-capital-gains-taxes.pdf) finds that capital taxes remain among the most economically damaging forms of taxation precisely because they reduce the incentive to innovate and invest. By increasing them the government will deter investment in Canada and chase away capital at a time when we badly need it. Business investment, which is crucial to boost living standards and incomes for Canadians, is collapsing in Canada(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/comparing-business-investment-per-worker-in-canada-and-the-united-states-2002-2021). This tax hike will make a bad economic situation worse.Finally, as noted, in the video the prime minister claims that this tax increase will generate \"almost $20 billion in new revenue.\" But investors do not incur capital gains taxes until they sell an asset and realize a gain. A higher capital gains tax rate gives them an incentive to hold onto their investments, perhaps until the rate is reduced after a change in government. According to economists, this \"lock-in(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/EconomicCostsCapitalGainsTax.pdf)\" effect can stifle economic activity.We need a 'That's enough, thank you!' federal political party(https://financialpost.com/opinion/thats-enough-thank-you-federal-political-party)Capital gains tax hikes are terrible optics for Canada(https://financialpost.com/opinion/capital-gains-tax-changes-terrible-optics-canada)The Trudeau government likely bases its \"$20 billion\" number on an assumption that investors will sell their assets sooner rather than later - perhaps before June 25th, to take advantage of the old inclusion rate before it disappears (although because the government has not revealed exactly how the new rate will apply that seems less likely). Of course, if revenue from the tax hike does turn out to be less than anticipated, the government will incur larger budget deficits than planned(https://budget.canada.ca/2024/home-accueil-en.html) and plunge us further into debt.Contrary to the prime minister's claims, raising capital gains taxes will not improve fairness. It's bad for investment, the economy and the living standards of Canadians.Financial PostJake Fuss and Alex Whalen are analysts at the Fraser Institute.Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the business news you need to know - add financialpost.com(https://financialpost.com/ ) to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here(https://financialpost.com/newsletters/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2024 Postmedia Network Inc.
