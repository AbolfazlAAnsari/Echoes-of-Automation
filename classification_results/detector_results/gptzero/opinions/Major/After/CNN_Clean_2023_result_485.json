This shift suggests significant feminist progress - and, if our policies and institutions don't adapt, significant pitfalls.In 1940,just about 8%of American households were made up of \"solitaires.\" By 1970, it was nearly 18%, and by 2022, it hadskyrocketedto close to 30%.Part of this shift reflects an expanding universe of opportunities for young people and for women in particular. Withmore women going to collegeandparticipating in the workforce, the old model offemale dependence on a male earnerhas largely fallen by the wayside. As a result, most womendon't have to marryin order to find financial security or social approval.Partly as a result of this decades-long surge of women into higher education and the workforce, Americans aremarryinglater than ever before, and less often than ever before. While the average woman in1950married at age 20 and the average man at 23, by early2021 those ages were around 28 and 30, respectively. And the more educated a woman is, the later she weds: The average woman with a graduate degreenow marriesin her 30s, according to Bowling Green's National Center for Family & Marriage Research.But, perhaps contrary to stereotypes, the more education a woman has,the more likely she is to tie the knot- she'll do it later, but her marriage may also be moreegalitarianand it is statistically less likely toend. According toa recent Pew study,one-third of American 40-year-olds with a high school degree or less have never married, compared to fewer than one in five Americans with a bachelor's degree or more. Thiseducation gapin marriage is nowwell-documentedby researchers, and cause for some concern: What happens when marriage becomes a class privilege?These later marriages (or no marriages at all) mean more years as a single person. While many American young adults spend at least some of these single years living with theirparentsor with roommates, many also live alone.For many Americans - especially those with college degrees - this period of less-fettered young adulthood brings myriad benefits. People who spend their 20s and even 30s single often enjoy all kinds of opportunities that were far less available to previous generations: opportunities to make deep friendships the center of one's social and emotional life, to travel and adventure, to explore our own needs and desires, to live alone, to pursue our passions and careers without the weight of multiple dependents, to date around and figure out what it is we actually want, like and need in a partner.The economic self-sufficiency that so many women now enjoy means thatfar fewer womenhave to settle for abusive or unkind partners - or even those who are perfectly decent, but just not the right fit for them.I suspect that most Americans would not want to return to a time when it was normal for girls to get married as teenagers. But the rise of single American households is not all ascendant girl bosses and brunches with friends.If this radical rise of American singles brought along with it a radical reshaping of community ties, family structures and opportunities for human connection, it might be an unqualified good. Instead, though, an increase in singles has coincided with an increase in disconnection, isolation andloneliness, all of which areassociatedwith poorer mental, physical and financial health. Those \"deaths of despair\" we hear about so often - deaths from suicide, drug overdoses and alcohol - are more concentrated amongunmarriedmen, and men are much more likely than women to live by themselves (women, notably, are much more likely to live with their children).ThetypicalAmerican living aloneis less likely to be the 30-year-old career woman and more likely to be a 70-year-old divorced man: A study found that while9% of 25-to-34-year-oldsin 2015 live alone, more than a quarter of those over 65 do.This relatively new and seemingly growing mass of singles, though, don't seem particularly well-served by American policy and our institutions. If we want more Americans to thrive regardless of whether or not they're partnered, we need those policies and institutions to change in line with the public they're supposed to benefit.Despite the fact that our lives and family make-ups have undergone transformational changes in the last few decades, our political policies, support systems and workplaces stay stuck in the past, and still operate under the false presumption that nearly all Americans live in traditional nuclear families. For many Americans, health insurance is tied to employment, or a spouse's employment, putting singles at a disadvantage; while a couple has two shots at enjoying the benefit of employer-sponsored health insurance, a single person can only rely on themselves for what should be a universal benefit.Single people who live alone are also, by definition, on their own when it comes to housing - and stuck in a nation where housing is increasinglyexpensive, particularly inthe large citieswhere single people tend to congregate and find community.There are few options for deeply integrated, morecommunity-orientedways of living. Much of the United States has been parceled off intosingle-family homesbuilt for nuclear families and connected by vast expanse of roadway navigable primarily by car; this has the effect ofisolating usfrom each other, making it harder to meet other people, decreasing casual day-to-day interactions and making many of our lives smaller and lonelier. As The Washington Post's Emily Badgerput italmost a decade ago, \"We're increasingly a nation of single people, but we're still living, quite literally, in a world built for families.\"Many men who marry enjoy a significantpay bump, and married people generally enjoy tax breaks and the discount of sharing household expenses. As other prosperous and developed nations have expanded theirsocial safety netsand given their citizens benefits including universal or affordable childcare, paid parental leave, paid vacation, paid sick days, extensive job protections, reasonable retirement plans and generous unemployment insurance,the US has made women the safety net. This is hard enough for women who are partnered. For women who aren't, it's a set-up for failure.And while people are single longer, conservative states are restricting or banning abortion and thereby making it harder for women, single or not, to decide whether and when to have children - forcing a great many single women into parenthood to theirphysical, emotional and financial detriment.The number of elderly singles is also on the rise, and they're also imperiled by the lack of a social safety net, which puts more pressure on younger women who disproportionately become caregivers for parents.American household demographics have changed significantly in the past half-century. Those changes demand that our policies and institutions change, too, in order to meet people where they are and to lay the foundations for human well-being.Most people thrive when they haveconnection, community, material stability, and a life that feels meaningful, but few of us can build these things on our own. We need communities with the infrastructure to foster relationships, not more suburban sprawl and isolation in cars. We need policies that allow people to access to the basics - healthcare and days off when they're sick; support for children and the elderly - without assuming that women, and often mothers and single women, will pick up the slack. We need cultural and legal shifts that allow for a variety of relationships to be affirmed, recognized, celebrated and rewarded.Single life can be joyful or lonely, empowering or demoralizing. For many people, it's all of those things. What it doesn't have to be, though, is politically ignored and culturally marginalized, especially as the number of single households continues to rise.Opinion by Jill FilipovicTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
