She called it white lying.For two years, I was her chief caregiver as she battled dementia. Over and over I reached into my caregiving toolbox and pulled out white lies when needed. She would never know she had given me such an important tool in caring for her.Kathy WoukNew YorkUse Diplomacy to End the Nuclear Arms RaceTo the Editor:Re “A 3-Way Nuclear Rivalry Upends U.S. Strategy” (front page, April 20):China’s decision to grow its nuclear weapons arsenal to be on a par with or potentially more advanced than that of the U.S. could not be worse news. I fear that the danger of an intentional or inadvertent launch of global nuclear war will soon be greater than it was when the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 put us on the brink of a nuclear apocalypse.In more bad news, the war in Ukraine has led a desperate, reckless Vladimir Putin to unilaterallysuspend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, our last functional nuclear control treaty.The world already has an estimated 13,000 nuclear warheads, though just a few dozen detonations of thermonuclear weapons could end the ability of the planet to sustain human life. Our hope now is that intense, mutually respectful diplomacy will succeed in bringing sanity to the negotiating table.During the late 1970s and ’80s I was a member of a physicians’ antinuclear organization that rallied around this singular message: If we have a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, no matter how it starts, there will be no possibility of a medical response.Our “prescription” was that prevention, meaning diplomacy, was the only strategy that could save us from nuclear annihilation. Consider that prescription officially refilled.Irwin RedlenerNew YorkThe writer, a pediatrician, is founding director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University.Unity, Civility and the Decline of Old Social MediaTo the Editor:Re “Social Media as We Knew It Is Long Gone,” by Brian X. Chen (Tech Fix, front page, April 20):The shift from large social media sites to smaller, more specialized networks is another blow to the nation’s deteriorating sense of national unity. Patriotism and belief in the best attributes of the core American projecthave declined sharplyin recent years, particularly among the young.With the further fragmentation of people’s social and political identities and the reduction in the number of platforms that bring people together for national events — happy and tragic — the belief in a common national purpose and quintessential patriotism founded on pluralism, diversity and can-do American exceptionalism are bound to decline.It would be another body blow to the patriotic vision that for so long made this country that “shining city on a hill” admired the world over.Richard M. PerloffClevelandThe writer, a professor of communication and political science at Cleveland State University, is the author of “The Dynamics of Political Communication.”To the Editor:“Social Media as We Knew It Is Long Gone” notes that Twitter “automatically responds to press inquiries with a poop emoji.” That is alarming.Many decades ago I taught 42 second-grade students in a Northern California school. Every one of them knew better than to make toilet jokes in public. Apparently the “bro” culture (encouraged by Elon Musk) missed that message.Or perhaps that culture and those influencers just don’t care for social niceties? Down with ideas; up with shock jocks. Bad news for public social discourse in the future.Judith Koll HealeyMinneapolisPersonalized SearchTo the Editor:In “Google’s Fight to Stay Ahead of Bing’s A.I.” (front page, April 17), the new search engine being developed is described as offering users results tailored specifically to each individual’s needs.I worry that this race toward ever increasing personalization of results may exacerbate existing polarization and eventually lead to users’ receiving only content that affirms their existing perspectives.While the winner of this hyper-personalization race may gain more users, the cost to societal cohesion could render us all losers in the end.Ethan AnnisOakland, Calif.This article appeared in print on page A23."
