That would be the second-highest corporate income tax in the developed world. Just below Colombia.Households bear the burden of the corporate income tax in the form of higher prices and slower wage growth. Companies do not simply absorb the tax, it is passed on to all of us.Biden also promises to increase the tax on Subchapter S corporations, partnerships and all \"pass through\" businesses, most of them small businesses, to 39.6%. These employers pay their taxes through the personal income tax rate, not the corporate rate.ELECTION 2024 PUTS $6 TRILLION IN TAXES ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOTBiden’s budget promisesto increase the federal capital gains tax to 44.6%, the highest rate in 100 years.California businesses would pay the 44.6% federal capital gains taxplusa 14.4% state capital gains tax for a combined rate of 59%.

It isn’t \"real.\" Yet you will be taxed as if you had made the sale and received the income.Big government politicians have a habit of imposing \"trickle down taxation,\" where a tax is advertised as only hitting \"the rich.\" They lie in order to get the tax into law. Once in place, the tax gradually expands to hit the middle class.Take the federal income tax. When it began in 1913, thetoprate was 7%, and it only hit households making more than $15.8 million in today’s dollars. Now the income tax hits nearly half the country and thebottomrate is 10%.TAX HIKES IN BIDEN'S BUDGET WOULD BE ‘DEVASTATING’ FOR AMERICANS, SAYS TOP HOUSE TAX WRITERAnother example is the\"Alternative Minimum Tax\"imposed in 1969. It was only supposed to hit 155 high-income households nationwide. But that’s not what happened. The tax gradually expanded to threaten 30 million households by the early 2000s.Biden is already using \"trickle down taxation\" to hit more and more Americans with his stock tax.

All but 10 Democrats in the House voted against a resolution opposing a carbon tax this spring.And all these new Biden taxes will be collected by a supersized and unreformed IRS.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GROVER NORQUISTGrover Norquist is president of Americans for Tax Reform.
