Another government official has proposedwithholding press accreditation from foreign journalistsdeemed hostile. Doing so would win Israel zero sympathy from the foreign media but clarify the kind of benighted regime that is in charge.There is still more, all pointing in the same direction: empoweringgovernment controlover news broadcasts, strengthening media bodies the government favors and weakening to the point of destruction those platforms it perceives as critical. Imagine how Americans would react if Biden sent government money to MSNBC or if former President Donald Trump had sent government money to Fox News.This assault on the media is straight out of thecynical playbookimplemented by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who transformed what had been a jewel in the democratic crown of post-communism intoan autocracyrun by one man. Like Orban, Netanyahu knows it's easier to engineer permanent rule with a domesticated press and hobbled opposition.And indeed, as already stated, Netanyahu's government has targeted much more than the free press. It has proposed225 unilateral lawsthat in sum would turn Israel into an authoritarian state, eliminating its liberal democracy - and it has begun legislating some. These includespecific measuresto weaken the political opposition, such as removingjudicial oversight of the parliament's abilityto bar opposition parties from running. Other measures would expand the authority of religious Jewish courts not beholden to secular law in whichmen enjoy superior status to womenand theLGBTQ communityis treated as an abomination.The shamelessness is mesmerizing.Another proposalwouldstrike from the books the crimes of fraud and breach of trustby politicians, which are preciselytwo of the three corruption chargesNetanyahu faces in court, in an ongoing trial. (Netanyahudenies any wrongdoing.)Netanyahu's government is doing all this with a coalition that did not winan outright majority of votesand is in power only because unwise splits in the opposition caused 12% of its vote not to be counted -two splinter groupsfell just under the minimum percentage 3.25% of the vote needed to get into parliament.It is a legal parliament majority, but the vote was by no means a mandate to kill off the democracy that has underpinned the special relationship with the United States. Some of the proposed laws may ultimately not pass, but the coalition has shown its true face.The US president is of course free to meet with whomever he chooses. Biden knows that Netanyahu will use any such meeting to try to weaken the popular pro-democracy resistance at home, where fears about a decline in Israel's special relationship with the US are partly behind his flagging support. He will undoubtedly claim the relationship with America isas strong as ever.Here's hoping that Biden will make clear at Wednesday's meeting and in the weeks to come, that destroying the free press is not a value the United States can share or support in any form. That message will find its way back to Israel and will perhaps hasten the day when this disgraceful, obscure authoritarian chapter is over.Opinion by Dan Perry and Gilead SherTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
