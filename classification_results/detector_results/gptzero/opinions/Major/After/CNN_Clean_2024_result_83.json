He was arrested at the Port Angeles, Washington, border crossing driving from Canada.The scaremongering about terrorists pouring across the southern border also misstates where the terrorist threat in the US largely emanates from. Since 9/11, there has only beenone lethal terrorist attack in the USby a foreign national with ties to a terrorist group: In 2019, a Saudi military officer who had been communicating with an al Qaeda affiliate in Yemenkilled three US sailorsat the Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida. This Saudi officer had not crossed the dangerous Darien Gap in Panama and then traveled all the way across Mexico to cross the southern border; he had arrived legally in the US two years earlier.The vast majority of terrorist attacks carried out in the US since 9/11 have been carried out by US citizens or permanent residents, none of whom had to cross the southern border because they were already in the US. Typical of this cohort is Omar Mateen, who, inspired by ISIS,killed 49 peopleat a Florida nightclub in 2016. Mateen, a US citizen, wasborn in Queens, New York.The biggest terrorist threat in the US in recent years hasnot been from jihadist terrorists like Mateen but from extremist right-wing terrorists motivated by racial or ethnic hatred or anti-government sentiments, according to aUS Government Accountability Office reportlast year. These terrorists are US citizens, not immigrants.In 2019, in the most lethal right-wing terrorist attack in decades,a 21-year-old White manshot and killed 23 people he thought were Hispanic immigrants at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. In amanifesto the terrorist posted online, he referred to what he called a \"Hispanic invasion\" as his rationale for the killings, echoingTrump's own rhetoricabout an immigrant invasion coming across the southern border.The most unsettling act of domestic terrorism in decades was theJanuary 6, 2021, riotat the US Capitol, in which some 140 police officers were assaulted, according to the US Department of Justice. Since then, more than 1,200 people have been charged with federal crimes, ranging from relatively minor offenses like trespassing to more serious charges such asassaulting police officers. Around 900 of these people have pleaded guilty or been convicted of charges, according to ananalysis by the Associated Press.The rioters at the US Capitol were among Trump's supporters who had responded to his invitation to come to Washington, and he then directed his rally goers to march to the Capitol, knowing some of them were armed. Trumpwatched TV coverage of the riot passivelyfor hours before intervening to try and stop the mayhem.Last year, Trump said the riot he helped to instigate at the US Capitol was a \"beautiful day\" in atown hall with CNNwhen, in fact, it was one of the sorriest episodes in the history of the republic. If he is elected president again, Trump haspromised to pardon a \"large portion\" of the rioters.When it comes to acts of terrorism, it might behoove Trump to take a careful look in the mirror instead of misdirecting attention to the southern border.Opinion by Peter BergenTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
