On Monday, Pence alsoraked in $250,000at an event hosted by an oil executive, where donors reportedly praised the former vice president for his combative turn at the debate, according to Politico. Politico quoted Pence backer Victor Smith, who described the comments Pence got at the event as: \"'Gosh, you look like you had a little fight in you, we love seeing it, where did that guy come from?\"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose image as a formidable rival to Trump has been supplanted by that of a struggling candidate, also reportedraising $1 millionin the days that followed. While his campaign was certainly hoping to outflank his opponents in more dramatic fashion, the fundraising bump was somewhat of a surprise, given his middling debate performance.There were mixed reviews for some of the newer voices of the party. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who was seen as one of the most promising figures of the GOP, had raisedsignificant amounts of cashsince announcing his candidacy in May. But hisdebate performancedidn't impress - in fact, there were points when he was barely able to squeeze a word in.Ramaswamy seems to be enjoying a big surge when it comes to media attention, name recognition and campaign funding. He raised$450,000in the hours after the debate, a campaign spokesperson said. While he might not have matched some of his competitors on that front, he has certainly exceeded expectations as someone who was largely unknown just six months ago. Although his moderate success might just point to his being the most recent candidate to capture the public imagination, others speculate that hisbombastic, smashmouth extremismis exactly what the next generation of Republicans are craving.The two Republicans vying to represent the Republican \"establishment,\" former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, didn't make much of a splash. Neither candidate has publicly released figures in the aftermath of the debate, although Hutchinson said that he added4,000 new donorson debate night.So, who was the big winner? None of them. All of their success is overshadowed by the former president, whose campaign said it brought in a whopping$9.4 millionin the aftermath of his Georgia indictment. Trump, who saw his mug shot as a fund-raising opportunity, has blitzed supporters with the kind of merch usually reserved for rock bands and sports teams.As New Republic columnist Michael Tomaskywrote, \"The conventional wisdom asks: How can Donald Trump simultaneously participate in all these criminal trials and run for president? The question misses the point of Trumpism ... The trials are the campaign. To Trump's followers, nothing else will matter.\"Any news that emerged from the debate was soon overwhelmed by Trump and his booking in Fulton County, Georgia. Right now, the other GOP candidates can't compete with the media attention, the love of Republican voters and the campaign dollars that are being heaped onto Trump. At this point, being the target of multiple grand juries is a better path toward dominating the Republican primaries than strong debate performances, compelling ideas or even the promise of being able to build the broadest political coalition.While Republicans were trying to sell one-minute soundbites and blistering quips against each other, Trump, who didn't even feel the need to show up, is raking in more money by leaning into his trouble with the law. In a party that has embraced an anything-goes mentality, is this really much of a surprise?Opinion by Julian Zelizer, CNNTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
