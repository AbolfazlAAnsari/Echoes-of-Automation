But if you thought the lack of global attention meant the cause has died, prepare to be inspired again.On Friday, Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi won this year'sNobel Peace Prize. Mohammadi is a prisoner of the regime, but that has done little to quell her passion or her activism. Even within the walls of Tehran's infamous Evin Prison, and despite cumulative jail sentences ofmore than 30 yearsand a ban on seeing her husband and her two children, Mohammadi has proven indomitable.The Nobel committee awarded her this prestigious prize \"for her fightagainst the oppression of womenin Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.\" The committee also recognized \"the hundreds of thousands of people who, in the preceding year, have demonstrated against Iran's theocratic regime's policies of discrimination and oppression targeting women.\"This Nobel prize is for all the women fighting for freedom in Iran.And that fight continues. Even inside Evin Prison.Just before the news of the prize broke, Mohammadi was incontact with CNN, managing to send an audio recording and aletter through intermediaries. The material is breathtaking; proof of a core of moral courage that most of us can hardly comprehend.In the audio message, one can hear Mohammadi leading chants of \"woman, life, freedom\" by prisoners in Evin. Ponder that for a moment.Evin is a chamber of horrors, as Mohammadi herself documentedlast yearinher book, \"White Torture,\"which includes women's testimonies of what transpires in the prison's ward 209. Their accounts describe a place where intelligence officials interrogate women; where they are not only tortured and sexually abused, but where living conditions resemble medieval prisons during the Inquisition.After the book was published, Iranian authoritiesadded time to Mohammadi's prison sentence. They have also punished her for her continuing activism. In August, the regime tacked onanother yearafter shespoke to the mediaabout sexual assaults in jail and pointed out what she described as the hypocrisy of a religious state's use of sexual violence. (The Iranian government has denied the widespread allegations of sexual assaults against detainees,calling them \"false\" and \"baseless.\").The following month, she wrote an article in The New York Times with the headline: \"The more they lock us up,the stronger we become.\"The brutality has apparently done little to quell the fires burning for freedom. In written answers to CNN's questions, she says this \"still is the era ofgreatest protestin this prison.\"In the audio recording shared with CNN, one can also hear women singing \"Bella Ciao,\" an Italian folk song linked to the fight against fascism that Iranian women have adopted as ananthem of freedomduring last year's street protests.That uprising exploded when a young Kurdish-Iranian woman was detained for allegedly failing to wear her headscarf properly. Mahsa Amini, 22,died in the custodyof the morality police. (She was actually known as Jina to friends and family, which means \"life\" in Kurdish.Jin, Jiyan, Azadimeans \"woman, life, freedom.\")Amini's death was the last straw. Iranian women, who wereoften joined by men, took to the streets to demand equality and an end to the repressive regime.Mohammadi explainedin her letterto CNN that mandatory hijab is a tool of subjugation and control over women, which by extension facilitates \"control over the entire society,\" and helps \"to preserve the image of religious Islamic men.\"In response to the protests, the government imprisonedtens of thousandsof protestersand their relatives, andexecutedan unknown number. It carried outpurges of perceived criticsfrom universities and the media.The government imprisonedtens of thousandsof protestersand their relatives, andexecutedan unknown number. It carried outpurges of perceived criticsfrom universities and the media.The streets grew quieter. But if you think the movement - and the danger - ended, think again.This week, 16-year-oldArmita Geravandwas hospitalized after she got on a train at a metro station in Tehran on Sunday. While it is still unclear what happened, a Norway-based group focused on Kurdish rights said she was \"assaulted\" by female officers of the morality police. Insecurity camera footageshowing only the exterior of the train, Geravand is seen entering the carriage, and then being carried out onto the platform. She is nowreportedly in a comain a military hospital in Tehran.Authorities deny the accusations, saying she was hospitalized due to an injury caused by low blood pressure.Geravand, it seems, may be one of the countless Iranian women who have refused to surrender to the crackdown. Women are still required to wear hijab, and they do it when entering government buildings or walking into a bank. But on the street, thequiet resistance continues. The defiance persists.Resisting a violent regime requires courage, but doing it from inside one of the world's harshest prisons requires a special kind of courage and an uncommon depth of integrity and commitment. For Nobel prize winner Narges Mohammadi, it's a clear choice. \"I am sure,\" she wrote to CNN, \"that the worldwithout freedom, equalityand peace is not worth living.\"Opinion by Frida GhitisTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
