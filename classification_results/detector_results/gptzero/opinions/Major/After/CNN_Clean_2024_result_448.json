FARA was, in many ways, forgotten - even as the foreign lobbying industry itself exploded in the 21st century.Then, in 2016, then-PresidentDonald Trump entered the White House, and thanks to the number ofalleged foreign agentsin his administration,prosecutors finally began focusing on how wide-open Washington was to these kinds of foreign agents - and how necessary enforcing FARA was.As a result, by the late 2010s, prosecutors began launching a number of FARA-related prosecutions among a wide range of figures close to Trump. Among the figures targeted for their secret foreign lobbying links were individuals such asPaul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, who was later convicted for failing to disclose hisforeign lobbyingwork (among other charges). Trump's formernational security adviser, Mike Flynn, acknowledged failing to register as a foreign agent as part of hisguilty pleafor lying to the FBI, before the Justice Departmentdroppedthe case and cleared his record. Prosecutors targeted others along the way, including former Trump adviser Tom Barrack, who wasacquitted, and former Trump campaign adviserRick Gates. While not all of the prosecutions were successful, the efforts breathed new life not only intoFARA, but shone a new light on howforeign regimestarget and corrupt American politicians overall.Which is where Menendez and his trial enter the picture. It's not just that the allegations against Menendez illustrate how bipartisan such foreign lobbying efforts are. But they further illustrate just how far these efforts go beyond figures like Trump or his inner circle - and just how successful these regimes can be, if they target the right Americans.Regardless of this trial's outcome, the allegations should be a wake-up call not only for American officials, but alsofor Americans across the country. After all, if foreign regimes could target and recruit the most important congressional official tasked with crafting American foreign policy - and if they could do it as successfully as Egypt and Qatar allegedly did - then no congressional official is off-limits.This story has been updated with the latest news developments.Opinion by Casey MichelTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
