As a writer, I took his work off the shelf not just for pleasure but for renewal, recharging the creative adrenal gland when I was blocked and pacing the floors.The prose from his non-fiction collections \"The Moronic Inferno\" and \"Visiting Mrs. Nabokov\" does not feel dated, despite being written decades ago. It is the rare journalism that inspires regular re-reading, unlocking new insights, while waging a war against cliche.Like earlier eras of literary heroes, Martin Amis traveled in a generational pack. They were a post-punk crew that migrated from the UK to the US, including Hitchens, Tina Brown and Salman Rushdie.Writers who came up in their shadow and were later lucky enough to work alongside them found their brilliance matched only by their willingness to raise a glass with young people of a similar spirit, if less blessed with raw talent.I once had the surreal experience of traveling with Amis on a reporting trip to Iowa covering a 2012 GOP debate and having him read my second book \"Wingnuts\" on the flight as homework. As I sat in the seat next to him, trying to stay cool while listening for any hint of approval, I wondered if he could hear how many sentences were influenced by his work.In his final book, \"Inside Story,\" part memoir and part novel, Amis returned to his friendship with Hitchens in the 1970s, prior to their becoming famous.  It chronicles a doomed affair, flashing forward at times to the decline of their friend Saul Bellows from dementia, as well as Hitchens' death. It seemed to hint at a long goodbye of Amis' own. But the door closed faster than I'd imagined.Amis received honors and fame, as well as some jealous disdain - but no Pulitzer or Nobel. He got a lot and deserved more.As I got word of his passing from an alert on my phone, I happened to be watching my children run around at a playground and I recalled one of the many Amis lines that kicks around my cranium - this one from perhaps his most celebrated novel, \"London Fields.\"\"Watching children in the park...it occurs to me as I try to account for childish gaiety, that they find their own littleness essentially comic. They love to be chased, hilariously aware that the bigger thing cannot but capture them in time.\"In true Amis fashion, those sentences are about death as well as love - with flashes of laughter punctuating the space in between.Opinion by John AvlonTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
