Jean Carroll civil casesover sexual abuse and defamation and theNew York civil fraud judgment.The handing down of multiple indictmentsboosted Trumpin the Republican primaries. The beginning of the hush money trial hasn'tnoticeably hurtTrump in polling matchups against President Joe Biden. Most of the country appears divided over whether Trump is being treated more harshly or lightly than other defendants, according toa CNN poll conducted by SSRSin April, but about three-quarters of voters backing Trump say they will still support him even if he is convicted of a crime. (Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing in the four cases against him.)In this particular case, Trump could be jailed for speaking out during a trial over allegations that some critics say should bea case of misdemeanor chargesonly, while an accuser such as former Trump attorneyMichael Cohenhas been nearlyubiquitous in the press. (Merchan has warned Cohenthat if he keeps criticizing Trump the gag order barring the former president from comments about witnesses, jurors and others might no longer apply to references to him.) One of Trump'sgag rule violationswas reposting a link to aNew York Post columnby George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley attacking Cohen's credibility on the basis ofpast perjury.Discussions of offensesfor which Cohen pleaded guiltyseem like fair play for public debate rather than an attempt to threaten or intimidate a witness. Trump and his supporters could argue a double standard here.All these developments come against the broader backdrop of Trump blaming his legal woes on his political opponents - Biden and allied Democrats. While Trump's rhetoric may be overstated, Democrats who purport to be defending democracy, norms and the rule of law, not least through these prosecutions themselves, are taking a risk.The plain fact is that Trump is the only political figure of his stature to face two impeachments, four indictments and a civil fraud trial. Some of his political appeal appears to stem from voters thinking the powers that be will not allow them to choose him again. Putting him in jail before he is convicted of any of these alleged offenses during a campaign in which he is leading in many polls would reinforce all these arguments.There are obvious risks to Trump, too. The unprecedented sight of a presidential candidate behind bars could make all these charges seem more real, and there is no telling how voters will react. In what is shaping upto be a close race for the presidency, even a small shift could be significant.Juries are also unpredictable. There is no way of knowing in advance how they would react to Trump going to jail for violating the gag rule. It is possible that it would make him a more sympathetic defendant. Jurors could also be swung toward a conviction if a jailing reinforces their belief in his guilt or they don't respond well to his defiance. Either way, the voters at home aren't the only audience Trump needs to reach.Nevertheless, given the way Trump's past legal problems have largely played out, it is easy to see how he could turn a brief incarceration to his advantage. Voters may well decide that jailing the former presidentis not the way they want to see presidential candidates treated in this country.Opinion by W.
