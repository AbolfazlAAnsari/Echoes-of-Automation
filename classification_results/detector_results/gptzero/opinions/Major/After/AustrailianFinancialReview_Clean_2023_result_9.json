Funny that.We're not as bad as iSignthis, says Creso PharmaCreso Pharma is on its third chairman in 18 months, having lost Adam Blumenthal to an ASIC raid and his replacement, James Ellingford, to bizarre TikToks documenting his relationship with a much younger woman.

Creso's censure was revealed by the ASX on Monday afternoon. Creso rushed out its own release an hour later, telling its shareholders that while it was glad the \"historical\" matter was now resolved, it didn't deem the ASX's reprimand \"appropriate\".Creso admitted last year to having issued a fifth of a $5 million placement to a vehicle controlled by the parents of one of its directors without telling shareholders. The company described it then as an \"administrative oversight\".Writing in response to Monday's ASX censure, Wachtel nominated seven other companies that had done the same thing yet escaped the distinction. In fact, Creso was aware of only one company that has been the subject of a censure, and that's iSignthis, whose issues were of a \"far more serious nature\". Lumping Creso in with iSignthis, which is presently fighting ASIC charges, \"would be gravely prejudicial and a material injustice\" to Creso. Of course, it's even worse than that because the ASX never actually censured iSignthis (it merely threatened to).Creso's dodgy placement goes back to then-director Blumenthal, who then (and still) headed corporate advisor Everblu. As lead manager, Everblu handed a fifth of the placement to Suburban, a company held by his parents. But Creso, of which Blumenthal remained a director, apparently \"did not see the final allocation list before the securities were allocated, and did not get an opportunity to independently verify whether any related parties had participated\".The ASX sidestepped this extraordinary feat of compartmentalisation by saying that Creso should nonetheless have reasonably foreseen that related parties of its directors would want to participate in the placement, making the breach serious enough to warrant the censure.When the breach was discovered and reported by Creso, Suburban sold its shares at a $380,000 loss.Blumenthal is selling his Bondi lighthouse for $9.5 million, having settled into the $30 million trophy home he and his wife bought in 2021.Meanwhile, Ellingford was last week reportedly fined $900 in Southport Magistrates Court after admitting to possessing a small amount of cocaine. This is after he filmed and uploaded videos featuring bags of white powder, which he told us in November were definitely \"bags of flour\".He was granted bail on other charges, after having spent two months in remand.Gerry Harvey's spruiking rouses the shortsSpruiking his company's half-year results two weeks ago, Gerry Harvey (again) extolled shareholders to \"sell your house, sell your boat, sell your car [and] put the lot into Harvey Norman\".The market did the precise opposite.Harvey Norman's shares are down 9.6 per cent since the result. Many are betting they have further to fall.In the week to March 6, Harvey Norman was the ASX200 stock with the highest amount of new short interest, fully 8.9 per cent of its free float (or 4.1 per cent of the total) in the hands of short sellers, which is an increase of 17.9 per cent on the week before the result.ASIC's short data is a few days late, but to last Friday, a further 3 million shares have been short-sold. Short interest at the retailer is at its highest point since 2020 but still down from the heights it reached in 2017.In the past fortnight, Harvey himself has been a buyer in the same market, putting down $14 million to gobble up another 3.7 million shares. If he profits from these trades, the short sellers lose, and vice versa.Of course, Harvey doesn't think \"criminal\" shorting should be legal at all. When he listed the business back in 1999, he banned institutions and issued stock only to retail shareholders and other small-time supporters.In the years since, enough of these small-time investors have dumped their stock to leave plenty in the hands of institutions and major fund managers only too happy to clip the ticket by lending it out to shorters whenever there's demand.This drives Gerry to distraction. No doubt he'll blow up to someone about it soon."
