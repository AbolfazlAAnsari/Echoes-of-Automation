Yeta 2015 National Bureau of Economic Research studyfound that the credit \"generated very little change in college attendance or other college-related outcomes.\"A 2017 study by theIZA Institute of Labor Economicsreported that the \"key insight from our study and others is that tax credits for college do not affect student outcomes - even when students receive information (on) them.\"Education and economics scholarsput it bluntly in 2018: \"Evidence now clearly shows that these credits have zero effect on college attendance.\"Similarly, anestimated 13.6 million taxpayersclaimed more than $27 billion inmortgage interest deductionsin 2022. Themortgage interest deductionallows taxpayers who itemize deductions to write off the interest they pay on their home mortgage with the intent to make homeownership more accessible.Yet 2020 research by theCongressional Research Servicesuggested that because wealthy taxpayers benefit most from the deduction, it \"may have a larger effect on the size of homes purchased than on the decision to become a homeowner.\"Another academic studyfrom 2013 determined that the mortgage interest deduction \"has no discernible impact on the level of US homeownership.\"The Inflation Reduction Act created or expanded 24tax creditsfor green energy programs. Yet when the Government Accountability Office in 2015 examined two credits aimed at encouraging alternative energy production, itreportedthat since the IRS isn't required to collect project-level data, \"the total generating capacity they supported is unknown.\"In two recent reports, GAO complained about the lack of data to judge the effectiveness of the New Markets Tax Credit, or NMTC, and \"opportunity zones,\" tax programs intended to promote investment in low-income areas.GAO foundit was \"difficult to establish causal links between NMTC-related financing and these reported project outcomes.\" AnotherGAO reportsimply declared \"there are insufficient data available to evaluate (opportunity zone) performance, including outcomes.\"Both parties have learned that \"cutting taxes\" through targeted tax breaks is more broadly popular than creating new spending programs. But the IRS' job should be to collect taxes, not deliver benefits. It has all the money and auditors it needs to do that; it just needs a simpler tax code.The path to a simpler tax code would start by eliminating many of these tax programs altogether through fundamental tax reform, or at least as a means of reducing the national debt.Opinion by Scott HodgeTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
