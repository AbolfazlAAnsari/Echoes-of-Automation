And I know there’s a lot of misinformation out there,\" Biden said. \"So, I came today to speak the truth — the truth about promises made and promises kept.\"That’s one promise unkept.Biden lied about the economy’s healthand lowering gun crime, then pivoted to his real platform for Black Americans — stoking racial division and attacking former President Donald Trump.BIDEN CAMPAIGN SCOLDS MSNBC, CNN FOR COVERING TRUMP TRIAL OVER 'BLACK VOTERS FOR BIDEN-HARRIS' RALLY\"And, folks, the threat that Trump poses is greater in his second term than his first,\" he told the crowd. That's probably why the Biden-Harris campaign wasted no time fundraising off Trump's guilty verdict on Thursday.President Joe Biden onstage during the 2024 140th Morehouse College Commencement Ceremony at Morehouse College on May 19, 2024, in Atlanta, Georgia. (Photo by Paras Griffin/WireImage)Biden is right — with the Black vote, Democrats can make Trump a loser again in November. Except this time, Black Americans aren’t buying into Biden’s ‘American Promise’ of high inflation and elevated crime. Just ask my fellow Black New Yorkers, whom I spoke with at Trump’s South Bronx rally just before Memorial Day weekend.I met James Freeman, a father and college administrator born in New York. He said he didn’t feel price hikes waning.\"You can’t shop at Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods. Now, you got to pick ShopRite or Save-A-Lot,\" he said. \"Certain cheaper brands, imitation brands, just to make ends meet.\"Yet,Biden painted a rosy pictureof the economy, claiming that his administration is \"opening more doors for economic opportunity\" in the Black community by bringing down \"corporate greed\"-inspired inflation. He also patted himself on the back for setting record-low Black unemployment and flooding our economy with an unneeded round of stimulus checks.Freeman isn’t crazy, and you aren’t either. Since April 2021, the consumer price index for all items has increased 17.41%. Today, Americans pay an average of 27% more for energy, gasoline, and electricity than in April 2021.When Americans received up to $1,400 from the American Rescue Plan, 49% paid off debt, and 32% saved it. But today’s economic situation is so dire that Americans spent the stimulus check savings and are in more debt now than before the pandemic. Credit card debt delinquency has been climbing since the end of 2021 despite historic lows during the pandemic.President Biden, who cares about the Black unemployment rate if our salaries can’t put food on our tables? Who cares about the American Rescue Plan you signed when the checks caused an inflationary spiral that has left us with less than before?Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris mentioned gun violence several times during that rally. Harris commended her Office of Gun Violence Prevention, and Biden name-checked George Floyd again — mark that off your Bingo card.Biden was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris in Philadelphia, but once more they pandered.(Win McNamee/Getty Images)I couldn’t help but notice the four Philadelphians murdered over Memorial Day weekend, including a 16-year-old riding a bike and three fatally shot within 45 minutes.Democrat mayors are applauding themselves for modestly decreasing murder rates this year, but an analysis of 32 cities by the Council on Criminal Justice shows that the homicides were 18% higher in 2023 than in 2019.And it’s not just violent crimes like murder. Vehicle theft is now criminals’ crime of choice, with 2023 being another record-breaking year. Washington, D.C., and Maryland have seen auto theft surge by 64% and 63%, respectively.Americans nationwide are paying for it. Auto insurance increased an average of 14% in 2023 after climbing 11% the year prior. No wonder the Pew Research Center reports that 58% of Americans say that \"reducing crime\" should be a top priority for the president and Congress to address this year.President Biden, who cares about the Black unemployment rate if our salaries can’t put food on our tables? Who cares about the American Rescue Plan you signed when the checks caused an inflationary spiral that has left us with less than before?Here’s the reality: Biden has nothing to run on except grievance politics.Biden spent half of his time trying to convince Black Americans like me to vote for him by calling Trump racist. Biden says Trump’s a racist landlord, he doesn’t think Black lives matter, he’s a neo-Nazi, the originator of a new –ism — birthism, and that he would’ve jailed Black Americans if they stormed the capital.Like in his Morehouse \"commencement address,\" Biden questioned American fairness and democracy. To Biden, democracy for Black Americans is \"a trail of broken promises\" unless he’s in the Oval Office.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONSorry Joe, the Morehouse graduates you demeaned and many other young Black Americans like me won’t let you rob our agency.It’s safe to say we’re leading the Black rebellion against the Democrat Party. The Pew Research Center has found that 28% of Black Republicans are 18-29, which is far greater than the 17% share of Black Democrats.\"People are waking up, especially young African Americans that went to college; they worked hard, they did the right thing, and they made the right decisions,\" Dwayne Moore, a Queens resident and New York State Assembly District 29 candidate, told me. \"Who’s giving us a break? Who’s really advocating for us?\"Biden ended his speech with this: \"Folks, America has always been a place where we’ve worked toward a more perfect Union, where those who were excluded in the past are included in the promise in the country today.\"A faculty member raises a fist as President Joe Biden speaks during a graduation ceremony at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, US, on Sunday, May 19, 2024.(Christian Monterrosa/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Biden, you can’t help those previously excluded from the American Dream achieve it today if you’re destroying it for all Americans. Your Utopian promises of restorative, climate and reproductive justice do not matter if the hierarchy of governance’s lowest level — safety and economic prosperity — isn’t achieved.President Biden, Black Americans like me don’t want your American Promise. We’d like the old one back. DANIEL IDFRESNEDaniel Idfresne is a rising junior at Syracuse University.
