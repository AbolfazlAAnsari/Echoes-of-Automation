Another two-thirds of parents agreed or strongly agreed that internet service providers should be required to obtain age verification (like a drivers' license or credit card) before allowing individuals to view pornography.Future action will likely take up these concerns. Just last week, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouriintroduceda bill that would bar users from under age 16 from opening a social media account. While the implementation mechanism would likely need to be improved on -- relying on Big Tech companies to keep copies of every American's drivers' license safe may not work out -- the direction of the legislation is laudable, recognizing that American parents are looking for bold action when it comes to keeping kids safe online.The battles over Big Tech and accusations of algorithmic bias may be what gets the Republican base riled up. But in a divided Congress, both parties should listen to the parents who make up their base -- giving families more tools to protect their kids online is not only long overdue, it's a political winner.Opinion by Patrick T.
