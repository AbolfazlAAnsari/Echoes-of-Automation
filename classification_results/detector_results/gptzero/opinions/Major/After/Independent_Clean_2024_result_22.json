There must be at least five or six competing factions now within the party, all pulling in different directions.It obviously makes a mockery of any proposals Sunak may espouse when offering his party to govern Britain. It seems that the Tory party has morphed into a disparate lobbying group of disaffected MPs. Rather than having firm convictions for running the country as a group, they have various leaders vying for attention and promoting their ideas of what the people deserve.So carry on Tories, you’re doing Labour a power of good. There is no way back for Sunak’s party, the country is sick and tired of the uncaring, divisive, deceitful and incompetent Tory governance.Keith PooleBasingstokeDon’t just smell the coffeeI read The Independent’s recent article, I must admit, with a wry grin at the kamikazeactions of Simon Clarke.  What political planet is he on, that thinks the public will put up withanother leadership vanity contest, so soon before an election? This now ungovernable, factionalised party needs to drink the coffee, never mind smell it.Of course being a Labour supporter all power to their manoeuvres, but it is shameful to witness this shambolic behaviour in a government and party. I never thought I would ever agree withPriti Patel but she is right: the public are sick and tired of wannabe leadership candidates and their self-indulgence is indeed appalling. Labour’s mantra is now ringing so true: “Country first, then party”. But the Conservatives have their ears firmly closed to that one.Judith A DanielsNorfolkSilence speaks a thousand wordsSo, no sooner than Sunak and Michael Govegive in to 40 Tory MPsincluding Karl McCartney and Ben Bradley, to provide an improved local government funding settlement, up pops dear old Clarke to call for his head!A one-off many might think? I don’t think so. Looking at Twitter/X, one finds thatClarke has the supportof Skipton and Ripon MP Julian Smith who says he “couldn’t agree more” whilst the silence fromJacob Rees-Moggand Andrea Jenkyns speaks a thousand words in itself.Geoffrey BrookingHavantDelivering the answerOh joy, at the stroke of an Ofcom pen theRoyal Mailcould see all its woes evaporate.Reducing deliveriesfrom six days a week to five, or even less, will pave the way to a brighter future.Unfortunately,the reality is rather different.  All that will happen is that fewer people will use the service, especially businesses, as items will not get to where they want them to be promptly. First-class stamps will be made extinct.Consequently, revenues will fall leading to more cutbacks – almost certainly staff-related – which will then impinge on performance targets, which will lead to more customers fleeing and so on; ad infinitum. No, the only answer to this shamblesis to renationalise, reorganise and fund the Post Office correctly for the 21st century.Robert BostonKent"
