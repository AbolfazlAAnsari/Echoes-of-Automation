The potential economic impact shouldn't be overstated, however. In 1990 the inclusion rate was raised to 75 per cent, where it stayed for nearly a decade, and no discernible harm to the general economy was observed.Still following the sun, despite daylight saving: Opinion(https://financialpost.com/opinion/william-watson-still-following-the-sun-despite-standardized-time)What the Ontario budget should do - but probably won't(https://financialpost.com/opinion/what-ontario-budget-should-do-but-probably-wont)The many benefits of booze that the scolds ignore: opinion(https://financialpost.com/opinion/peter-shawn-taylor-the-many-benefits-of-booze-that-the-scolds-ignore)As for the alternative minimum tax (AMT) Ottawa is proposing to amend, it was introduced in 1986 to ensure that taxpayers who made extensive use of tax shelters, including capital gains relief, paid at least some tax. But from the outset analysts have panned the AMT as less a genuine attempt to curb top-tail incomes than an exercise in political optics. In recent years, it has affected fewer than 50,000 taxpayers, with an average hit of $7,000, and it raises less than one in every 800 dollars of federal personal income taxes(https://financialpost.com/category/personal-finance/taxes/). Yet many filers must endure the complex Schedule T691 just to determine they are not liable for AMT.My study proposes various alternatives to the AMT that would be simpler and collect far more revenue from top-end filers. These all involve a threshold of some kind (annual income, amount of gains, or lifetime cumulative gains). Above that threshold a higher inclusion rate would apply to gains while dividend tax credits would be capped. Given the high year-to-year variability of people's realized gains, with many filers' incomes shifting temporarily above the threshold, the schemes I look at would restore income averaging, which was abolished in 1988 when tax rates were flattened and the inclusion rate began rising.Some advocates of increased capital gains tax would direct the revenues to unrelated uses, but another possibility would be to use part of them to abolish the 33 per cent top-bracket rate or to raise the threshold at which it applies, thus improving productive incentives for many high earners. In any case, policies of the kinds sketched here would be far more effective in addressing top-tail inequalities. Let's see what AMT reform the upcoming budget offers: real advances toward that goal or just more polishing of the optics?Rhys Kesselman is professor emeritus at the School of Public Policy, Simon Fraser University. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
