Actually, real middle class incomes rose rapidly under Trump, but have declined under Biden because of inflation.It wasn’t just the economy, though, that Biden lied about. In a discussion about immigration, he claimed that the border patrol had endorsed him; during the course of the evening, the border patrol union went on X contradicting that claim.Biden also claimed that Trump wanted to cut the number of cops in the U.S. though, really, it was hard to discern what he actually meant to say. And, once again, Biden claimed he ran for president because Trump said there were \"very good people on both sides\" of the Charlottesville protests, a story that has, as Trump noted, been thoroughly debunked.LEFT WING FACT-CHECKER ADMITS TRUMP NEVER CALLED CHARLOTTESVILLE NEO-NAZIS ‘VERY FINE PEOPLE’ IN BLOW TO BIDENIn fairness, Biden does not have a record that is easy to defend. He tried but failed to justify his catastrophic border policy by suggesting that he revoked Trump’s policies because they were inhumane.  Asked about why he was losing support from black families, Biden noted that he was proposing a $10,000 credit towards new mortgages for blacks; in fact, that suggestion covers all people and is in response to the unaffordability crisis in housing.Against expectations, former President Trump kept himself under control, even when Biden went deep into the mud. At one point, the president referenced Trump having sex with a porn star while his wife was pregnant; for a man who claims to take the high road that was a mistake.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONTrump went after Biden on the border, on the disgraceful withdrawal from Afghanistan and on the economy. At the same time, he missed many, many opportunities to criticize the president on excessive spending, on not having a game plan to win the war in Ukraine, for kowtowing to pro-Palestinian progressives in his party, for threatening huge tax increases, and for trying to pay off student debt after the Supreme Court has ruled such measures illegal.Trump obliquely hit some of those points, but more facts and figures could have strengthened his case. He also spent too much time making broad and bold claims about how well the country was doing under his leadership; he should have talked more about what he would do in the future to make people’s lives better.Even so, Trump performed better and more energetically than Biden, and managed to score some hits. For example, he noted that more people died from the pandemic under his successor than during his own term, even though the COVID vaccine became available as Biden took office. That is true.Trump also repeatedly accused Biden of underminingSocial Security, Medicare and Medicaid by granting benefits to the millions of migrants who have entered the country illegally. With seniors one of Biden’s few remaining support groups, it was a smart play.Also against expectations, CNN’s moderators, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, handled the event fairly. The night was full of surprises.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK"
