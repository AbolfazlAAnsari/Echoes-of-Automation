            "inputText": "By Ross McKitrickThere are two places in North America named Eagle Pass - one in British Columbia, one in Texas. Both are small and nondescript, yet both witnessed, in their times, historic events where the life of a country stood in the balance. B.C.'s Eagle Pass had its moment in 1885. Texas's is playing out now.Just past B.C.'s Eagle Pass is where in November 1885 Donald Smith of the Canadian Pacific Railroad drove in the last spike, marking completion of a national railway. This \"ribbon of steel\" connected the continent from Atlantic to Pacific and gave rise to the string of cities that helped define Canada's west: Winnipeg, Brandon, Regina, Calgary, Revelstoke and Vancouver.Building the CPR was an audacious undertaking for a young country. Work teams had to cut and blast passages through granite shield and unforgiving mountains, build trestle bridges across soaring gorges and raging rivers, and battle floods, snowstorms and all the harsh weather Canada can muster. They set out with no guarantee a route was even possible: the crew going west across the Prairies was nearly at the Rockies before Major A.B. Rogers finally found the pass through the Selkirk range that today bears his name.The financial obstacles were just as daunting. The CPR investment syndicate and the government of Sir John A. Macdonald both nearly collapsed under the weight of construction costs. In the project's final stage, bankruptcy seemed inevitable. Its backers prepared to lose everything, which for some railway officials even included deeds to their homes.The 1885 ceremony in the shadow of Eagle Pass was not just about finishing a railway, it was a celebration of shared values, sacrifices and vision. A country needs more than bodies, it needs believers. It needs people willing to risk their money on new ventures, not merely consume the capital built in the past by others. And it needs leaders who, above all, love the people they govern and want them to prosper.Which puts into full relief the nightmare underway at the other Eagle Pass, a little town along the Texas-Mexico border, one of the most crowded crossing points during the influx of an estimated six million(https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/Border_Statement_1.24.2024.pdf) migrants who have illegally entered the United States since Joe Biden took office and dismantled Trump-era border security measures. Not only has the administration refused to secure the southern border, it has gone to court to force Texas(https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/24/politics/doj-texas-border-water-barriers/index.html) and Arizona(https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/u-s-sues-arizona-governor-over-shipping-container-barrier-on-mexico-border) to dismantle physical barriers they tried to erect.Cities as far away as New York(https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66259075) and Chicago(https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/chicago-warns-of-humanitarian-crisis-as-city-struggles-to-house-migrants) are buckling under the strain of housing even small shares of the migrant flows. In December alone the number of illegal immigrants topped 300,000(https://www.foxnews.com/video/6344129148112). The administration chose that moment to order Texas Border Patrol agents to cut down a razor-wire fence in Eagle Pass, thus reopening the entry point. In response, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott dispatched(https://www.newsweek.com/texas-national-guard-blocking-border-patrol-southern-border-greg-abbott-1860329) the Texas National Guard to block federal entry to the site - which prompted the administration to file (and win) an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court.Undeterred, Abbott declared an invasion(https://www.foxnews.com/politics/abbott-declares-texas-right-self-defense-from-migrant-invasion-amid-feud-with-biden-admin) was underway and invoked(https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/Border_Statement_1.24.2024.pdf) constitutional authority to assume state control of the border. Defying the administration, he refused to remove(https://x.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1749861371074744520?s=20) the razor wire and instead is adding to it, effectively daring Biden to deploy armed forces against him. Twenty-five Republican governors(https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/01/26/25-governors-back-Abbot-on-tougher-border-stance/5361706245079/) have announced they support Texas's stance.Though he has said(https://www.zerohedge.com/political/biden-blackmail-intensifies-wont-shut-border-till-congress-coughs-ukraine-israel-funds) he could shut down(https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/26/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-bipartisan-senate-border-security-negotiations/) the border Biden is first demanding more money for Ukraine, Israel and other administration priorities, thus all but admitting the open border is a tactic used to blackmail Congress on other issues. His actions thus embody the very opposite of the nation-building, unifying spirit on display at our Eagle Pass in 1885. The president has pitted states against states, neighbours against neighbours and Washington against its own citizens. According to a recent poll, a majority of Americans (including 39 per cent of Democrats) believe(https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2823605/voters-back-texas-border-wall-feel-biden-starting-civil-war/) Biden is risking civil war. Why is he doing this?pic.twitter.com/BDStCsUiDm(https://t.co/BDStCsUiDm)- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 5, 2024(https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1754548634614390906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)Soft-headed, well-meaning naiveté probably plays a role. The more cynical answer(https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1754548634614390906) is that the Democrats want to pack southern states with grateful immigrants who will eventually acquire voting rights and give them a permanent Congressional majority. If that isn't what's going on, the administration should explain itself, even if doing so means admitting its own failures. But above all, it should act quickly to secure the border.Who most deserves the award for economic ignoramus?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/who-deserves-award-economic-ignoramus-trudeau-eby)OSFI should concentrate on finance, not climate policy(https://financialpost.com/opinion/osfi-should-concentrate-finance-not-climate-policy)A rose is a rose is a ... carbon crime?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/a-rose-is-a-carbon-crime)Building the CPR was controversial and difficult, but everyone understood the goals: to build and unify a great new nation. The Biden administration's actions are dividing and demoralizing the U.S. and squandering its economic and social capital. I hope the spirit present in 1885 at the first Eagle Pass somehow descends on the second and restores hope to a nation in crisis.Ross McKitrick is a professor of economics at the University of Guelph and senior fellow of the Fraser Institute.Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the business news you need to know - add financialpost.com(https://financialpost.com/ ) to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here(https://financialpost.com/newsletters/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2024 Postmedia Network Inc.
