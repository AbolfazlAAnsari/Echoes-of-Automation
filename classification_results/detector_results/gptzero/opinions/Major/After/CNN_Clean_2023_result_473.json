What happened?\"(Nevertheless,DeSantis' campaign touted raising $20 millionduring the second fundraising quarter that ended June 30, calling the haul \"the largest first-quarter filing from any non-incumbent Republican candidate in more than a decade.\")People havedebatedwhat's behind the governor's \"failure to launch\" (as Politico put it), but his challenges can be blamed on one person: Ron DeSantis. That may seem obvious to some, but onpaperDeSantis is damn impressive. He graduated from Yale University and Harvard Law School with honors. He served in the US Navy as a lawyer, beingawarded the Bronze Star Medalfor meritorious service.From there, he was a federal prosecutor. And while he won his2018 race for governorby only .4%, DeSantis was reelected in 2022 bynearly 20 points- animpressive margin in a statewide racein Florida - and he raised an eye-popping$100 million-plusfor that campaign.With this impressive resume - coupled with Trump-backed candidates losing in key battleground states in 2022 and the former president being dubbed the midterms' \"biggest loser\" - DeSantis begansurgingin the polls. For example, a February Quinnipiac Universitypollshowed Trump with just a six-point lead on DeSantis.But asPoliticonoted in its article Saturday, Trump soon stepped up his personal attacks on DeSantis. In late January, I penned aCNN columnurging DeSantis to \"punch back\" in response to Trump's attacks because the GOP base values strong leaders, not punching bags.Instead, DeSantis tried to take the high road with comments in February about how he delivers results for the people of Florida,adding, \"I don't spend my time trying to smear other Republicans.\"Trump launched even more barbs against DeSantis on everything fromhis handling of Covid-19to his long-runningfeud with Disney- with the former presidentpredictingDeSantis would be \"absolutely destroyed\" by the company.DeSantis' response was muted at best. Despite Trump's onslaught of attacks, DeSantis is \"still not hitting the 45th president with any bare-knuckle punches,\"The Hill reportedlast month.To be blunt, many of his critics must be asking themselves if DeSantis can't (or won't) stand up to the twice-impeached, 77-year-old Trump, how can anyone believe he will take on our nation's enemies?DeSantis also comes across as cold, flat and bordering on whiny. For example, asked abouthis lackluster pollinglast week on Fox News, his low-key answer was toblamethe \"corporate media\" and - oddly - the president of Mexico. \"I think if you look at the people like the corporate media, who are they going after, who do they not want to be the nominee? They are going after me,\" he said,repeating pretty much the same lineagain Sunday on that network.DeSantis added, \"Who's the president of Mexico attacking because he knows we'll be strong on the border and hold him accountable in the cartels? He's going after me.\" (President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has urged Latino votersnot to support DeSantis, given his state's tough immigration policies.)Does either point hold up to scrutiny? Hasn't the media been critical of Trump, too, especially after the January 6, 2021 insurrection? And wouldn't the Mexican leader's criticism likely help DeSantis with GOP voters, given their views on immigration?Let me add this caveat about DeSantis' polling challenges, asothershave: It's still early in the 2024 race for the GOP nomination. At this point in the 2016 race, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was leading among Republicans inmany surveys. And in the 2008 race for the Democratic nomination, at this point, many pundits were sayingHillary Clinton was inevitable, yet Barack Obama eventually won the nomination - and the presidency.To that point, DeSantissaidlast week, \"I'm running to win in January and February. I'm not running to juice polling now.\"But as each day passes and he doesn't seem to be changing tactics, DeSantis threatens to become just another good-on-paper candidate who may not have what it takes on the national stage.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
