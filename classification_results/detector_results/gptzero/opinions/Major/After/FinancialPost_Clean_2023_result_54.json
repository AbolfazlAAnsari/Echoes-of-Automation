So, are other countries following our lead by shutting coal power plants and keeping coal in the ground? The answer is a resounding \"no.\"The world's first-, third- and seventh-largest emitters (China, India and Germany, respectively) are actually increasing their use of coal for power generation. Saskatchewan has three?coal power stations, one with carbon capture utilization and storage technology, that generate 1,530 megawatts of power.China, meanwhile, has 1,118 coal?power stations that generate 1,074,000 megawatts, permitted(https://energyandcleanair.org/publication/china-permits-two-new-coal-power-plants-per-week-in-2022/) the equivalent of two new plants per week?in 2022 and authorized another 20,500 megawatts(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/trudeau-demands-climate-sacrifice-while-china-burns-coal-with-abandon) in the first quarter of 2023.India, with 73 per cent of its electricity generated by 285 coal plants, has introduced(https://cea.nic.in/wp-content/uploads/notification/2023/05/Optimal_mix_report__2029_30_Version_2.0__For_Uploading.pdf) an electrical power generation plan that is heavily dependent on increased coal power and domestic coal production. By 2030, India plans to add another 26,900 megawatts of coal capacity and expects the country will consume 1.5 million tonnes of coal per year.Then there's Germany, a country with 63 coal power plants(https://www.statista.com/statistics/859266/number-of-coal-power-plants-by-country/) that has spent the last decade and at least 150-billion euros(https://www.dw.com/en/german-issues-in-a-nutshell-energiewende/a-38869543) promoting an \"Energiewende\" transition to wind and solar as it shutters emissions-free nuclear power plants but reopens coal plants.The accelerated use of coal by top global emitters will contribute far more greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere than any emissions reductions Canada could ever hope to achieve. While Ottawa may think that it is \"leading\" the world into a \"net-zero\" future, China, India and Germany are simply not following.Premier Moe is right to challenge Ottawa's unrealistic policy expectations to achieve \"net zero\" emissions. An honest, realistic national conversation about the true costs, benefits and consequences of the federal government's forced energy transition is long overdue and much needed. It's good that Saskatchewan has chosen to open the door to a rational debate.National PostRon Wallace is an executive fellow of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.
