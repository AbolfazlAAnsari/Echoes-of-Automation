Last year the UN Environment Programme forecasted a 50 percent increase in wildfires by 2100, indicating even the Arctic could be at risk of outbreaks by the end of the century.The fires are a symbol of a global order punch drunk on the exponential growth in hyper-consumerism. Earlier this year, the European Union forecasted the global consumer class will reach some 5 billion people – with 1.3 billion more people with increased purchasing power than today.If we are to create any future for the 10.4 billion people that will inhabit the earth by the end of the century, humankind needs to get much more creative very quickly as to how we design the world economy – from the products we use to the food we eat.Fortunately, the pace of human innovation has never been this fast, yet it will never be this slow again. The Ellen MacArhur Foundation for example forecasts by 2025 there will be 160 million designers and creative decision-makers in the world – representing five percent of the global workforce of 3.4 billion people. History proves that maverick creative thinkers drag humankind from one system to another. Never before have we needed this more.A new journal published this month – To Think Tomorrow – suggests governments and businesses around the world should give these thinkers the creative freedom to design a radical new world that doesn’t rely on perpetual consumer growth as the critical measure of success.The world is on fire. It’s time to design a new tomorrow.Sian Sutherland,                      Co-Founder, A Plastic Planet & Ben Parker,Creative Director, Made ThoughtAnimal testing needs to be left in the pastAnimal testing is a cruel and unnecessary practice that hasno place in the modern world.Since A.I presents even more opportunities for cutting-edge, non-animal methodologies, it’s high time for the government tohonour its manifestocommitment to lead in animal welfare and science by ending the mass suffering and killing carried out in laboratories across the country.Numerous studies have shownthat experiments on animalsare counterproductive, diverting resources away from more promising areas of research, causing animals to suffer, and delaying the development of potentially life-saving drugs. Just this week, the Animals in Science Committee published a letter to government ministers noting the urgency for a government-led strategy on the development of non-animal methods to protect humans and other animals alike.British public opinion stands with animals – the government must keep up with the times by getting rid of archaicanimal experiments.  Arming scientists with sophisticated, humane research tools is the best way forward.Dr. Kimberley JaynePETA UKThe silent power of the ticket officeI was aghast to readSimon Calder’slatest article in The Independent stating thatrail ticket offices arelikely to be closed by Christmas.I wonder if train operators understand the positive image of the service which is generated through the ticket offices. As an intermittent user of ticket offices, I can confirm the appreciation of others (often tourists) for the helpful, courteous service they receive there.I don’t see how staff on a busy concourse/ platform are going to provide similar support, even if the visiting punter knows who to ask for rail advice and ticket purchases.Sadly,rail operatorsare following the same trend as other organisations (such asbanks, utilities, BT) and diverting customers to online or phone contact from a face-to-face service. Invariably this leads to frustration for the customer, particularly when the query doesn’t fit the organisation’s algorithms.Rail operators need to be reminded of the significant silent benefit to their organisation from helpful ticket office staff. Once lost, appreciation of this personal service will lead to a worsening public perception of the railways, which, at this point, it could do without.Claire PikeLondon"
