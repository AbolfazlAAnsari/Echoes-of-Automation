Ask them whose bonds they would rather own if things are going off the rails in the global economy or even here in the US, and they will say those of the US Treasury. That's what happened when the Covid-19 pandemic struck - nervousglobal investors rushed to the safety of US Treasury bonds, and with good reason, as the US dollar is theglobal reserve currency. That is, other nations holdtrillions of dollarsin US Treasury bonds just in case something goes wrong and they need cash in a pinch.It is ironic that these bonds are being rated below those of other nations. The US government effectively stands behind its finances. It backstops the nation'stoo-big-to-fail banksand other financial institutions that are the bedrock of the US financial system upon which the global system depends. Indeed, global investors use the interest rate on US Treasury bonds to determine theinterest rateon other countries' bonds.Fundamental to a government's ability to pay its debt is the strength of its economy, which is the source of the tax revenues used to make those payments. Indeed, in justifying its downgrade of Treasury debt,Fitchled with \"the expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,\" which rests in part on the agency'sincreasingly unlikely forecast of a US recessionbeginning in the next few months. More importantly, while all economies have a business cycle, there is no developed economy in the world that is more dynamic with better long-term growth prospects than the US, which is exceptional infostering entrepreneurship, innovation and the technologies that power the entire global economy.Of course, our fractured politics are a worry, as they have compromised the government's budget process. Consider therecent battle over increasing the Treasury debt limitand looming prospects for a government shutdown later this year. These so-called governance issues are central toFitch's decisionto downgrade the nation's debt.But none of this is new. Theknock-down-drag-out political disputes over the government's finances date back to Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. And we've hadnumerous debt limit dramasandgovernment shutdownsover the decades. Each time, lawmakers have come to terms before doing irreparable economic damage.  Even the unseemly political theater over thedebt limitearlier this year was pretty benign as far as such shows go. There was no meaningful long-term fallout on the economy.Despite our vexed politics, lawmakers are getting things done. Consider the unprecedented policy response to the pandemic and the legislation passed since President Joe Biden took office. This includes thebipartisan infrastructure legislationthat will help rebuild America's broken roads and bridges, theCHIPS Actto promote semiconductor manufacturing and research and development, and theInflation Reduction Act, which is a large step toward going green.No doubt more legislation becomes law when one political party is in control of government, but that's the way things have gotten done historically. Each party advances their agenda when they gain control of the presidency and Congress. Our politics may be dysfunctional, but our government is still largely functioning at a high level.To be sure, the nation hasdaunting long-term fiscal challenges. Without meaningfully higher taxes and slower growth in government spending, our large deficits and debt load will become unsustainable. But the nation has been here before.The last time was in the early 1990s wheninterest payments on the debt ballooned, and the fiscal outlook darkened. This was the era of thebond market vigilante- bond investors nervous about the government's ability to pay on the debt drove up rates on US Treasury bonds to compensate for the perceived risk. That prompted then-President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, tostrike a budget dealthat led to the last budget surplus the nation has enjoyed in nearly a quarter century.Lore has it that former British Prime MinisterWinston Churchillsaid Americans will always do the right thing, only after they have tried everything else. This is true of our nation's finances. Despite our messy politics, we have always made good on our debt, and if our history is a guide, we always will.Opinion by Mark ZandiTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
