Have no audit of any; nullify all federal immigration laws. Let in toxic drugs that kill 100,000 Americans a year. Give free support to those millions who broke the law. Smear any objectors as racists and xenophobes.Keep adding $1 trillion to it each 100 days. Defame anyone wishing to cut wild spending as cruel and inhumane.Demonize allies like Israel. Allow terrorists to attack Americans without adequate response. See Islam as either similar orsuperior to Christianity. Make amends to leftist governments for supposedly past toxic American international behavior. Follow the lead of international agencies like the U.N., ICC and WHO to atone for past American neocolonial and imperialist behavior. Recede to second-tier international status, befitting American decline.Ensure each identity group rivals the other for victimhood and the state spoils it confers. Reboot all political issues by race and sex oppressors and oppressed. Destroy all meritocratic standards of admission, retention, promotion and commendation.Ensure no bail and same-day release for arrested, repeat violent felons. Empathize with the violent killer and rapist; ignore their victims, especially if they are slain police officers.Deliberately impugn as racists and insurrectionists the largest demographic in the military who in recent wars died at twice their numbers in the population — so that they leave or never join the military. Encourage retired high officers to slander their commander-in-chief. Cut the defense budget. Stop producing sufficient weapons, but leave billions of dollars’ worth of arms to terrorists.Use ballot removal, impeachment, civil suits, and state and federal indictments rather than elections to defeat an opponent. Mob the homes of non-compliantSupreme Court justices, and attack them personally by name.From left, Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil M. Gorsuch, Sonia Sotomayor and Clarence Thomas; Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.; and Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson, Samuel A. Alito, Jr., Elena Kagan and Brett M. Kavanaugh pose in the Justices Conference Room of the Supreme Court on Sept. 30, 2022.(Collection of the Supreme Court of the United States via Getty Images)Marry the FBI to Silicon Valley and hire its contractors to warp the news and hound supposed enemies of the people.Substitute inefficient, unreliable and expensive wind and solar power, even asenergy pricesnearly bankrupt the middle class.Consider males toxic, especially boys. Have no children, or as few as possible. Otherwise, assure children they are entitled, and must be sheltered.  Raise them to have grievances against past generations and current norms.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONSuspend theBill of Rightson campuses. Train youth to graduate despising their own culture and civilization. Recruit foreign students from hostile nations to subsidize campus commissar bloat. Replace the curriculum with therapeutic propaganda.Ban the SAT/ACTand do not evaluate comparative high school GPAs. Ensure merit does not select the student body. Charge tuition higher than the rate of inflation. Bill the government when students default on their loans.Why could thosecontrolling the presidentbe doing all of the above?1. They are delusional and think their socialist and globalist agendas are working and will save us.2. They are raging nihilists who do not like the U.S. and deliberately want it destroyed as a service to the world. A ruined U.S. is preferable to a strong America.3. They are Jacobin revolutionaries who are intentionally erasing the old United States as a prerequisite for creating an entirely new America that will arise from the ashes with no trace or even memory of its past.4. They have no agenda. They are aimless fools and utter incompetents. These bunglers just wing it day-to-day, in response to what theirradical media, academic and political masters dictate is necessary for them to retain power. They have no idea of the damage they are doing.5. A bit of 1-3, but probably not 4.There is cause for hope among this nihilist remaking of America: the people are fed up and will demand an accounting in the fall.Editor’s note: This op-ed is adapted from a tweet by the author.
