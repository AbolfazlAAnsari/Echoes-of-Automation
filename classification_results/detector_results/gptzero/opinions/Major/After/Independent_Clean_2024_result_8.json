Until now, there has clearly beenoverwhelming complacencyin drawing any conclusions or enabling any sort of justice.Stephen WoodsAddress SuppliedThis abuse of power needs retributionThe person(s) within Westminster who recommendedPaula Vennellsfor a CBE ought to be made to raise their hand and acknowledge that they made a huge error of judgement.Was pressure exerted to keep Ms Vennells quiet? Who in the government knew of the system failure? What part did Fujitsu play in the deceit and obfuscation? There are now many unasked questions which need answering. The net of intrigue is far-reaching.Because of what happened,innocent people havedied, been imprisoned, lost their homes, lost their businesses, been reviled in their communities and lost all hope in the UK’s judicial system.Can there be a more blatant episode in the history of Britain that perfectly demonstrates the crass villainy that our government and big business will stoop to? It’s understandable that now there is a whirlwind of action to rectify the great wrong done to these innocent people. Butwhy the disgraceful delayin the first place?Surely the powers-that-be must have realised, early on in this debacle, that the truth will eventually come out? All inquiries must ensure a full and frank explanation of the facts and retribution for the innocent. Otherwise it will be yet another impotent, false ending toa blatant abuse of powerand the law.Keith PooleBasingstokeCost of crueltyWe now know that Tory infighting over theRwanda bill resumesnext week. A group led byRobert Jenrickare supporting amendments to the government’s flagship bill along with Miriam Cates, Iain Duncan Smith, Suella Braverman, Jacob Rees Mogg and Danny Kruger.Yet the government stillwon’t come cleanabout how much of our money has been paid toRwandaalready. Shadow home secretaryYvette Cooper estimatesthat the government has pledged almost £400m to Rwanda, with additional payments of around £200,000 per person sent there. What’s more, migration minister Tom Pursglove has refused to contradict the figures. Surely, this underlines how thisgovernment is so unfitfor office.Geoffrey BrookingHavantWe are failing special needs students in schoolBoth the governmentand Labour have set out their plans this week for tacklingsoaring school absencerates. But missing from the debate as usual are those missing children with special educational needs.The number of autistic pupils persistently absent from school has more than doubled in the last five years – to more than 50,000. We need to tackle the reasons for this – namely thelack of appropriate SEND supportin schools. If we don’t improve thespecial educational needssystem, we won’t improve attendance rates.Jolanta LasotaChief executive at Ambitious about AutismChildren’s online safety needs to changeThe report from the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) showing that more children arecommitting sexual abuse offencesagainst other children is a damning indictment of the state ofinternet safetytoday. With the growth in user-generated content (UGC), our children are being exposed to more adult, extreme and illegal images than ever before, accessed with a tap on a smartphone. The impact of this material on children’s views of sex and what is appropriate behaviour isprofoundly damaging.Today, too many legitimate adult sites and social platforms are operating without rigorous age assurance (age verification or age estimation) in place, leaving them open to children. Likewise, reactive content moderation takes place after the damage is done and also isn’t able to keep up with the growing deluge of extreme and illegal content that has no place on the internet.The recently passedOnline Safety Actis designed to mandate long overdue change, but these developments need to be expedited. This meansOfcomworking to enact their new enforcement powers quickly, robustly and equitably and ensuring companies are incentivised to comply. Likewise, the onus is on content and tech firms to put in place rules and tools to ensure extreme and illegal content never makes itonto their platformsand to transparently report on how they are tackling this often invisible problem.Inaction and delay in tackling online safety is letting our children down. The time for change is now.Michal KarnibadAddress suppliedHaley is proving herself a valid contenderConservatives question Nikki Haley’s credentials as a US presidential frontrunner. Yet the former governor of South Carolina is expected to outperform Trump in the second Republican primary.The Washington Post explained the dilemma in Haley as liberals see it: “A big win for Trump in Iowa and then New Hampshire would effectively seal up the nomination for him. But a narrow victory or surprise defeat could change the dynamic with a long lull until the big contest.”No such “trap” exists, however.If the hyper-conservative Washington Times is right, Trump has reason to worry about Haley. She could be the last gambit before a head-on collision between Trump and Biden.Either way, Haley is proving herself a valid contender and plausible rival. At least her efforts could bring down headliner Trump a notch before the regular election season gets under way, following this primary season’s contentious voting.Angus WestAddress supplied"
