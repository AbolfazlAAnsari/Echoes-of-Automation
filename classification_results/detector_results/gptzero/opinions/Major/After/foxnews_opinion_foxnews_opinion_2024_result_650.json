More women became physicians, lawyers, judges, scientists, business executives, etc. than ever before.In other words, we entered previously all-male professions even as we continued to serve as nurses, childcare providers, teachers, office managers, and, of course, as mothers and wives.University of Pennsylvania transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines react after finishing tied for 5th in the 200 Freestyle finals at the NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships on March 18th, 2022, at the McAuley Aquatic Center in Atlanta, Georgia.(Rich von Biberstein/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)By the 1980s, our most visionary work had been disappeared from the American college curricula. Women's Studies rapidly became LGBTQ studies; racism trumped sexism as a core concern; prison reform for Black men erased all interest in shelters for battered women and rape crisis centers.Ironically, anti-capitalism/anti-imperialism/anti-Americanism as well as \"intersectionality\" were neat ways of denying Islamic gender and religious apartheid and a long history of Islamic imperialism and anti-Black slavery.It was also a conscience-free way of deserting and betraying women in the Middle East, Central Asia, India and the Far East, many of whom were victims of genital mutilation, sexual slavery and honor killings.Today, American teenagers have begun dressing as if they are celebrities i.e., half naked in public – except they lack the bodyguards and the money that celebrities command.Studies reveal that too many women are willing to have sex \"as if they are men\" but without experiencing sexual pleasure. Tragically, these trends continue.Second-wave feminism was far more focused on the right not to become mothers against our will than we were on the right to become mothers and to be able to raise our children in stable family environments, without risk of extreme poverty, and without the risk of losing our children unjustly.
