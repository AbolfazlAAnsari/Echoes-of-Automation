I haven’t decided which is worse - I miss one when I experience the other. Unnecessary prescription hormones have damaged my voice, my skeletal structure, and my hormonal system.Participants in the \"Detransition Awareness Day\" rally in Sacramento.(Courtesy Pamela Garfield-Jaeger)This is my truth, my experience, my life.MUSK SAYS TRANS CHILD WAS FIGURATIVELY 'KILLED BY THE WOKE MIND VIRUS,' VOWS TO DESTROY IT: 'MY SON IS DEAD'It was hard to come forward and talk about my experience. I am attacked viciously online bythe same trans communitythat love bombed me when I attempted to transition. Yet I have chosen to share my story out of love and concern for vulnerable children and teens who might be going down the same path I did.I don’t want suffering, confused teens to cut off their breasts thinking it will bring happiness. I don’t want sexual assault survivors to think that they can magically morph their female bodies into males and never feel vulnerable again, as I once thought.FEDERAL JUDGE RULES FLORIDA RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSGENDER MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR KIDS UNCONSTITUTIONALToday, I expect online bullies to attack me and call me names. But I do not expect reputable newspapers to do so for all their readers to see. However, in June, that’s exactly what happened.In the June 12 issue of the Santa Fe Reporter, ahead of the one-year anniversary on June 16 of New Mexico’s HB 7 taking effect,Independent Women’s Forumpaid for an advertisement featuring my story.New Mexico’s HB 7 forbids public entities and associated individuals from \"restrict[ing] or interfer[ing] with a person’s ability to access… gender-affirming health care.\" Essentially, this bill discourages anyone from telling young people like me about the risks associated with attempting to medically \"transition.\"TAXPAYER-FUNDED PLANNED PARENTHOOD BOASTS ABOUT BEING LEADER IN TRANSGENDER MEDICAL PROCEDURESThey want children’s \"gender identity\" affirmed – regardless of how fleeting or how serious the underlying issues that are causing the wish to transition are. I know from experience how this canbackfire on vulnerable youthand inflict irreversible, lifelong harm.The ad in theSanta Fe Reporterincluded a QR code linking to IWF’sIdentity Crisis documentary series, which tells my story and the stories of numerous others who experienced transition and ultimately \"detransition.\" I think it’s information that children and their parents deserve to have.Following IWF’s advertisement, the Santa Fe Reporter reportedly heard from activists and others who disliked it. That’s hardly a surprise. I hear from people all the time who prefer I stay silent and call me names rather than have an honest conversation about the dangers of cross-sex hormones and surgery for trans-identifying youth. I wouldn’t have been surprised if letters to the editor to that effect were published.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONBut that didn’t happen. Instead, publisher Julia Goldberg issued a large, full-color apology for running the advertisement, promised not to run further advertisements from IWF, and labeled our work \"an online anti-transgender misinformation campaign.\" That claim is blatantly false. Nothing in this series isanti-transgender. Nothing is misinformation.Unsatisfied, the Reporter then published what it entitled a \"Teachable Moment,\" in which it labeled our work at IWF \"anti-transgender,\" and part of an \"ongoing attack on transgender lives.\"Unbelievably,the story compares IWF’s advertisement (about whether teachers should face liability in the classroom) toWhite supremacy. It portrays IWF as in favor of the \"eradication of trans people.\" It then states that the Southern Poverty Law Center \"includes IWF\" in an \"anti-LGBTQ pseudoscience network.\"By labeling IWF’s basic educational resources – real stories from trans-identifying minors – as \"anti-transgender,\" the Santa Fe Reporter destroys any opportunity for common ground and understanding.I won’t back down to bullies. I’ll keep speaking out and telling my story because I care aboutvulnerable young people. I don’t want them to suffer like I have.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY PRISHA MOSLEYPrisha Mosley is a 26-year-old woman and detransitioner.
