Because the UCC is state law, state lawmakers can take concrete steps to restore the property rights of their constituents and protect them in the event of a financial crisis.On Monday, South Dakota legislators introduced a bill that would do just that. The legislation would ensure that individual investors have priority over securities held by brokerage firms and other intermediaries.The state Capitol building in downtown Pierre in central South Dakota(Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)It would also alter jurisdictional provisions so that cases are determined in the state of the individual investor, rather than the state of the broker, custodian or clearing corporation. This would ensure thatindividual investorsare able to rely on the laws of their local state, rather than permit big institutions to effectively pick the state laws and judicial venue most likely to give them the result they want.The question that state lawmakers must ask themselves is this: Is a system that would sacrifice the wealth of individual investors to protect the world’s largest financial institutions truly worthy of protecting? We don’t think so, and we hope that state legislators agree.Policies such as those beingconsidered in South Dakota– and soon, hopefully other states – must be enacted to secure the property rights of all American investors, as well as the health of the entire U.S. economy.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JUSTIN HASKINSJack McPherrin(Jmcpherrin@heartland.org)is the research editor at The Heartland Institute."
