Braverman allegedly tried to use herpolitical connections to arrangea one-to-one awareness course instead.Another potential breach of the code, but again Sunak took no action against her.Later in May 2023, it was revealed that Braverman may have broken the ministerial code by failing to declare her years of work with the Rwandan government viaher Africa Justice Foundation.Lawyers trained by Braverman’s charity are now involved in the UK’s £140m deal to send asylum-seekers to a camp in Rwanda – a scheme Braverman admits she “obsesses” and “dreams” about.Rishi Sunak took no action against her.To me, it seems Braverman hates the rule of law because it stops her from mistreating asylum-seekers as she sees fit. If anyone “needs to be jailed” it’s Braverman.Sasha SimicLondonI have hope Great Britain is still a caring nationI congratulate you on the numerous articles expressing views that the way asylum seekers are being treated by our government is inhumane. Suella Braverman has admitted that ourasylum system is broken, though omits to say that it is her political party that has broken it.The desperate people arriving in small boats are a small percentage of the total number of refugees waiting for the Home Office to process their application. If that had been done ina timely manner for allwho are languishing in hotels, the extortionate cost of housing them all would not have been incurred and those who have legitimate claims to be granted asylum could be working to help our economy grow.If the government had any integrity they would issue a manifesto including their immigration policy and give the British public the chance to vote on it by holding ageneral electionnow.If this were to happen I hope I am right in believing that Great Britain is still a caring nation and will reject these policies. I am 88 years old and have always been proud to be British, and I still am in regards to our support for Ukraine. But I am ashamed of most of the other policies imposed on us.Margaret CrosbyHertfordshireAre the nicknames necessary?Why is it necessary or acceptable to give English female sports teams, such as those for netball and football, patronising nicknames? These people are international sportswomen, not “roses” or “lionesses”.Alan BrownWirral"
