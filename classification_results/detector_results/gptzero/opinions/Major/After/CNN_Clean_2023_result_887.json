Hiding behind words to justify what we are seeing is not an option. This is not \"resistance\" or \"liberation\" - it is terrorism.The atrocities that have been committed will forever change every Israeli. Hamascommitted a pogromthe likes of which cannot be fathomed in a modern society where Jews have self-determination and a state of their own. This is the modern manifestation of pure evil.Somehow, this isn't apparent to some Americaninstitutions of higher education and their student organizations, many of which have responded to the terror by minimizing or even championing the complete lack of humanity on display.At Harvard - whose reputation lends a particular moral duty to lead in higher education - a group of 30 student associations issueda public statement over the weekendto say they\"hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.\"  (Afterintense backlashagainst the student statement, some students and their groups have tried to distance themselves or say they did not read it before they signed it.)When the administration finally weighed in, the first take was amilquetoast, word-salad statement signed by 18 administrators. It did not include a single unequivocal denouncement of Hamas and instead called for \"the pursuit of truth in all its complexity.\" It wasn't until Tuesday that Harvard's president finally issuedanother statement, saying, \"As the events of recent days continue to reverberate, let there be no doubt that I condemn the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas.\"Similar statementsusing similar words to Harvard's initial statement have been issued atother campuses. We must question loudly their moral clarity and why they won't speak clearly without equivocation.This is a time for presidents, trustees, deans, provosts and donors to articulate that there are no mental hurdles that should ever be jumped to rationalize the destruction and inhumanity perpetrated by Hamas. Those who cannot bring themselves to condemn these deplorable acts are complicit in them.They are setting an example for their students, who have watched for decades as leaders and faculty at their institutions have created moral\"whataboutisms.\"These students have watched their teachers embrace the discourse of \"decolonization\" and post-colonialist rhetoric; this campus climate makes it far too easy for some to paint Israel as the immoral aggressor.AtStanford University, an instructorhas been suspendedafter they, in the words of the school's statement, reportedly \"called out individual students in class based on their backgrounds and identities.\" A student leader who spoke to the first-year students in the instructor's classes earlier this weektold the San Francisco Chroniclethat the instructor asked Jewish students to raise their hands, separated those students from their possessions and called that a simulation of what Jews were doing to Palestinians.The instructor also allegedly asked students where they were from, labeling them \"colonizer\" or \"colonized\" depending on their responses, and made comments about colonization that sought to minimize the Holocaust. The school is not identifying the instructor but said in their statement that \"this report is acause for serious concern\" and the instructor \"is not currently teaching while the university works to ascertain the facts of the situation.\"The rhetoric of \"decolonization\" gives an undeserved academic veneer to some scholars' disdain for the world's only Jewish state, and too many students are clearly buying it. In an utter embarrassment to the university community as a whole, this week, National Students for Justice in Palestine called for a\"Day of Resistance\"celebrating a \"historic win for the Palestinian resistance\" on campuses around the country.Perhaps their institutions should offer to reimburse these students their tuition as their education has clearly failed them. The mission of a universitymeans nothing if its students can't distinguish between evil and innocent, between crimes against humanity and the moral obligation of a state to protect its citizenry.The college campus has become an entry point to normalize these words and ideas. Just as frightening, they continually spread beyond campus. At a rally in Cambridge, Massachusetts,organized by a group called BDS Boston(proponents of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement), this week, a speaker championed Hamas' acts of \"resistance.\"Oneproudly stated, \"Our resistance is the resistance of poetry and protest. ... Ours is the resistance of the stone, the knife, the gun, the drone, the tunnel, the rocket, and yes - the paraglider!\" The speaker continued, \"No liberation was ever won without risk. Liberation comes at a cost. Are you prepared to pay it?\"These words are incitement against allcivilians, Israelis, Zionists and Jews. University administrators should beware. They must recognize these words, and this inhumanity is coming to their campus if it's not already there.And in a space where words matter more than anything, few things could be more destructive.Opinion by Rachel FishTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
