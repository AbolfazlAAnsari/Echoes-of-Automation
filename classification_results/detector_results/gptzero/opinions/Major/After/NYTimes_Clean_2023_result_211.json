Our society owes members of the next generation the opportunity to understand American history, foundational texts, how the government is supposed to work and their role in our shared democracy.Before starting to vote, let alone reaching the college campus, students deserve comprehensive civic education that strengthens democratic fluency, fosters civic skills and generates civic belonging. The future of American democracy depends on it.Charles E. SavenorNew YorkThe writer, a rabbi, is executive director of Civic Spirit, which works with schools to enhance civic knowledge and engagement.To the Editor:I disagree with Debra Satz and Dan Edelstein of Stanford University, who argue that higher education has largely abandoned civic education.At DePaul University, with support from the Teagle Foundation, we have implemented a liberal studies course, “Lived Civics, the Social Contract and Public Life,” to build civic skills, historical knowledge and democratic dispositions among students.Taught by teachers across the university (in political science and communications, but also accounting, writing and rhetoric, theater, music and art), students learn about historical events and political upheaval as the evolution and constant renegotiation of our founding contract.In addition, the course is intentionally centered around fostering the democratic skill of listening, so that students gain an appreciation for one another’s lived experiences across their political differences. The goal of the course is to frame public problems as shared problems, which are ours to address — together. We would be happy to share the curriculum widely.Molly W. AndolinaChicagoThe writer is a professor of political science at DePaul University.The New Senate Dress Code: Casual or Just Sloppy?To the Editor:Re “The Senate Dress Code Gets a Casual Overhaul” (news article, Sept. 19):In an era when so many norms are being destroyed and so many institutions — the U.S. Senate included — are being degraded, the last thing we need is a downgrading of the Senate dress code. This is especially true of Senator John Fetterman’s outfits, which the rule change seems to be reacting to. These clothes are much more than simply “casual”; they are the absolute sloppiest and most thoughtless clothes you can imagine.The way senators dress is symbolic, and symbols are important. Elegant, formal clothes convey the idea that the Senate is an important place where important work is being done. Mr. Fetterman’s attire, in contrast, suggests that the Senate’s work is no more important than doing chores around the house or going on a run to the grocery store. The symbolism is made all the more resonant when the clothes are on Mr. Fetterman’s 6-foot-8 frame, to which the eye is naturally drawn.Why does Senator Fetterman insist on dressing this way? If the purpose is his personal branding — to scrupulously maintain his workingman cred — then I think he is seriously underestimating working people. Just because they may not need to dress in suits for their own jobs doesn’t mean they won’t respect and understand when someone else does. And anyway, Mr. Fetterman’s clothes are so sloppy that few Americans would go to work in them — the working class very much included.Fred GrossmanSeattleTo the Editor:Republican senators’ outrage about the relaxation of the dress code in the chamber is quite rich.Where is the outrage againstSenator Tommy Tuberville’s blockade of military promotions? Where is the outrage against the Jan. 6 rioters and Donald Trump? Where is the outrage against the threats to shut down the government? The list could go on and on and on.David WynnLivingston, N.J.DeSantis and VaccinesTo the Editor:Re “DeSantis Disputes C.D.C. Vaccine Advice” (news article, Sept. 15):It warms the cockles of my heart to know that Gov. Ron DeSantis is smarter and knows more than doctors, public health officials and infectious disease experts.David CowenSyosset, N.Y.This article appeared in print on page A25."
