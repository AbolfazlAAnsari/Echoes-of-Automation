They include: the lack of federal incentives for developers to submit new medicines(https://macdonaldlaurier.ca/waiting-for-new-drugs-for-rare-disorders-in-canada-part-1-regulatory-approval-nigel-rawson-and-john-adams-for-inside-policy/ ) to Health Canada; health technology assessment(https://macdonaldlaurier.ca/waiting-for-new-drugs-for-rare-disorders-in-canada-part-2-health-technology-assessment-nigel-rawson-and-john-adams-for-inside-policy/ ) that is neither accountable, independent nor transparent and makes recommendations about which drugs to cover in public drug plans to governments; and price negotiation(https://macdonaldlaurier.ca/waiting-for-new-drugs-for-rare-disorders-in-canada-part-3-price-negotiation-nigel-rawson-and-john-adams-for-inside-policy/ )s between government drug plans and manufacturers.Even when drug developers clear these government-created barriers, public drug plans(https://macdonaldlaurier.ca/waiting-for-new-drugs-for-rare-disorders-in-canada-part-4-government-drug-plan-listing-nigel-rawson-and-john-adams-for-inside-policy/ ) are under no obligation to add the approved medicines to their benefit lists. Too often governments focus only on drug costs and ignore the broader benefits effective drugs can bring, not only to the health and well-being of patients and their families, but also to other parts of the health system, to the economy and to society at large. If a new drug reduces doctor or emergency visits or hospitalizations or helps a person get back to work, those benefits typically are ignored by our drug assessment system.The federal government made matters worse over the past six years by planning to drastically reduce drug prices(https://macdonaldlaurier.ca/waiting-for-new-drugs-for-rare-disorders-in-canada-part-5-patented-medicine-prices-review-board-nigel-rawson-and-john-adams-for-inside-policy/ ) by regulatory order, not negotiation. This caused considerable uncertainty among developers, resulting in even fewer new drugs being submitted(https://www.canadianhealthpolicy.com/product/canada-falls-behind-in-new-drug-submissions-compared-with-the-united-states-and-europe/) for marketing approval here than in the U.S. and EU.Proponents(https://theconversation.com/with-a-pharmacare-bill-on-the-horizon-big-pharmas-attack-on-single-payer-drug-coverage-for-canadians-needs-a-fact-check-213041) plainly want a lowest-common-denominator government-run public plan that would crowd out private plans, which over two-thirds of Canadians currently rely on for drug access.Despite the federal government(https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/news/2023/03/government-of-canada-improves-access-to-affordable-and-effective-drugs-for-rare-diseases.html) committing $1.5 billion over three years to \"increase access to, and affordability of, effective drugs for rare diseases to improve the health of patients across Canada,\" its initiative is not comprehensive. So far, Canada has neither a government-endorsed national rare disorder strategy nor an Orphan Drug Act(https://financialpost.com/opinion/drug-access-canadians-rare-disorders-40-years-behind-americans) providing incentives to developers to launch orphan medicines in Canada. Most other developed countries have both.Patients' organizations have stepped in where governments have failed to act and proposed a Canadian strategy(https://www.raredisorders.ca/canadas-rare-disease-strategy/ ) that would include incentives and funding to encourage developers to launch drugs in this country and cut through the barriers we have described to provide timely access to the many innovative treatments on the research horizon. For example, access to breakthrough drugs could be allowed as soon as Health Canada says they are safe and effective, even as other administrative boxes are checked and prices negotiated. Other countries use this approach.Carbon taxes a perversion of free-market economic theory(https://financialpost.com/opinion/carbon-taxes-perversion-free-market-economic-theory)Capping ride-sharing licences in Toronto a public safety nightmare(https://financialpost.com/opinion/capping-ride-sharing-licences-toronto-public-safety-nightmare)Where's the evidence Canada is systemically racist?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/canada-systemically-racist-where-evidence)Canadians afflicted with any of the 11,000(https://rare-x.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/be-counted-052722-WEB.pdf) or so known rare disorders have significant unmet needs. Fewer than five per cent have any treatment beyond symptom relief or palliative care. The last thing these people need is for governments to ration innovative drugs even more than they already do or to force even deeper price cuts(https://www.longwoods.com/content/27112/healthcarepapers/canadians-need-improved-access-to-drugs-for-rare-diseases-not-more-denial) from drug developers in order to pay for universal pharmacare that covers only basic medicines.Canadians with rare disorders almost certainly will be even worse off if the NDP's parliamentary blackmail works.Nigel Rawson, affiliate scholar with the Canadian Health Policy Institute, is also a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, as is John Adams, CEO of Canadian PKU and Allied Disorders Inc. and volunteer board chair of Best Medicines Coalition. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
