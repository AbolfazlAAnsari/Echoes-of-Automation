One in five Canadian students is performing at the lowest level in math, and Canadian-born students are performing less well than their immigrant peers. All credit to new Canadians but the declining performance of young people born here should be a concern.Although 78 per cent of Canadian 15-year-olds are at or above a baseline of math proficiency, Canada's downward trend over time is troubling. Baseline here refers to \"Level 2\" proficiency - there are six levels of proficiency. The director for education and skills at the OECD (which created PISA testing) says Canadian student results are a cause for concern, as the changing world requires strong math skills now more than ever.School closures and other COVID policies clearly caused learning disruptions and hurt student achievement over the last couple of years.
