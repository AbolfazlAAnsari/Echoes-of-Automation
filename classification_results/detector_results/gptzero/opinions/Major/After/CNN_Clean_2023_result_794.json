Those EVs can requirefewer workers to manufacturethan gas-powered ones, especially when most of the batteries are currentlyproduced in China.Unlike Trump, who thinks that playing up this tension between pocketbook concerns and environmentalism wins him votes, Biden is offering a future where green energy can preserve jobs and the environment at the same time. It remains to be seen which perspective voters, especially those walking the picket lines, will choose.If we want to think about how we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels without causing economic pain, we must appreciate that the tension between these goals runs deep. Here history provides a cautionary tale about how hard it will be for Biden to go green without the loss of jobs or lifestyles that Americans are accustomed to.The conflict between economic and environmental concerns dates back most pointedly to the energy shocks of the 1970s, when Americans, who started the decade with a historiccommitment to environmental policy, abandoned many of those ideals when the first oil shock hit.October 17thmarks the 50th anniversary of theArab oil embargo. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) boycotted sales to the United States in retaliation for American support of Israel in theYom Kippur Warand then cut production, officially launching the United States into anenergy crisis. Within three months,the price of a barrel of oilhad quadrupled.Today's inflation is kids' play compared with that of the 1970s. Americans had been paying a few cents per gallon for gas, andprices increased so quicklythat gas stations struggled to display the price when itbroke through the dollar barrier.It was, as one White House adviser put it, \"anenergy Pearl Harbor.\"The rest of the decade would be defined by this oil shock and another that came in 1979 after theIranian Revolution.But rather than rousing Americans from their reliance on gasoline, the public insisted politicians do whatever they could to preserve their way of life.The '70s initially seemed be the decade of environmentalism. In 1970, President Richard Nixon signed the sweepingNational Environmental Policy Actinto law after a disastrous oil spilloff Santa Barbara, California. He went on to support theClean Air Act of 1970, which imposed astounding limitations on corporate America's ability to pollute.  Regardless of hispersonal views, this skillful politician knewbeing green would play well, especially with a younger generation.But Americans still loved their cars. And when that suburban way of life - made possible in part by a seemingly limitless supply of cheap gas - was threatened, much of that environmental mindset went on hold.As soon as the oil shock struck, there wasa reversion to coaland todrilling for oil. Sen.Henry Jackson, a leading environmentalist, becamethe Alaska pipeline's main supporter. Instead of letting gas prices go up, and thereby inducing cutbacks, there was enormous pressure on politicians to keep them down, resulting in a price control policy that even the conservative Nixonfelt compelled to support, though it wasultimately ineffective.There was no better symbol of the failures of environmentalismto take hold, in the face of rising prices, than the long gas lines that snaked across the country. Americans waited for hours, sometimes running out of gas, sometimes getting into fistfights, just to tank up atsky-high prices.It was that much more of a blow when the second oil shock struck under President Jimmy Carter's watch, as he hadtold Americanshe would solve the energy crisis. Thelong linesin the summer of 1979 made it clear he had failed.True,Carterfamously installedsolar panelson the White House's roof and promised that the country would receive20% of its energyfrom the sun and other renewable resources by 2000. But there was not much political will to make this happen.Even as he urged Americansto change their consumer habitsand shamed them for their indulgence, Carter, motivated by national security concerns, promoteda failed synthetic coal programand called America theSaudi Arabia of coal.Still, that was not enough to save Carter, who went down in defeat toRonald Reaganin the 1980 election, withDemocrats in Michigan's Macomb County, and elsewhere, switching their partisan allegiance.So where are we today? In 2023, environmentalism, even as it is subject to therampant polarizationof our time, is seemingly more popular than ever as we are living through wildfires, floods and record heat, all with devastating consequences. We see the consequences of climate changeall around us.And yet Americans still do not want to pay for a green future. In arecent pollfromthe AP-NORC Centerand the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, only 38% of Americans said they would be willing to pay $1 a month in a carbon tax to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.Such reluctance is especially true as inflation has gone up and made Americans that much more price-conscious - and many workers fear an energy transition that will threaten jobs in coal and theautomobile industry.It is that tension that Trump seeks to exploit,stoking fears that Biden's policieswill lead to the death of American car production.And yet there is reason to embrace some optimism. TheInflation Reduction Actnot only promises to bea once-in-a-generation piece of climate legislation, but it also offers an essential reframing that is necessary for sustained progress.Early reports suggest that this infusion of government funds is fundamentally changing the direction of American energy use and doing so in a new, more palatable way. Instead of strapping Americans with higher prices and inconvenience, the act offers the opposite:lower prices and greater convenience. And that is a real game changer.When Biden, inan unprecedented act, joined the United Auto Workers picket line the day before Trump's rally, he was promising a win-win scenario. Car companies could afford to pay higher wages and protect jobs, even as they adopt an EV fleet.The lesson of the 1970s is that the only way for real, permanent change to occur is to offer a better life. In their most ambitious version, Biden's policies do that: Through incentives and credits, a new network of electrical vehicles will make it ultimately easier andmore affordableto drive a car, and he has also offeredbillions for stimulating EV battery manufacturingin the United States.If Biden can deliver on the promise of his policies, it would not only redound to his political benefit but also put Americans on a greener path.Opinion by Meg JacobsTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
