The more extreme members of his caucus have been pushing for impeachment for months while he had, before this week, declined to commit.Now that some of them areopenly threateningMcCarthy's speakership, it appears he caved. Moreover, he recently said that he would notproceed without a formal voteon the inquiry, but there was no mention of that at all in his announcement of the inquiry Tuesday.Without such a vote, impeachmentlacks the force of law. McCarthy bitterly - and now hypocritically -criticizedformer Speaker Nancy Pelosi for announcing the first Trump impeachment before a vote (she later scheduled one).It is true that the younger Biden seems to have attempted to leverage his father's stature, based on thetranscriptfrom the closed-doortestimonyofHunter's former business partner Devon Archer, whom Republicanscalled to appearon July 31 before the House Oversight Committee.Archer claimed that Hunter would, for example, put his father on speakerphonewith potential clients to woo them (plus there have been a couple of similarly non-substantivein-person events). But according to a source familiar with Archer's appearance who spoke to CNN, Hunter's former business associate did not provide any evidence connecting Biden senior financially to any of his son's foreign business dealings.Making passing small talk in meetings - which is all Joe Biden'sparticipation seems to have amounted to, according to Archer's testimony - does not come close to a high crime or misdemeanor. The White Househas deniedthat President Biden had any involvement with his son's business deals on multiple occasions, responding that the House Republicans' \"own witnesses appear to be debunking their allegations.\" A lawyer for Hunter Bidensimilarly deniedthe allegations on his client's behalf.Moreover, years of searching have yet to yield any support at all for the allegation that Biden personally profited off his son's foreign business dealings. For example,when I was working on the first Trump impeachmentfor the House Judiciary Committee, we looked in depth at the issue with respect to Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.We focused specifically on Trump's accusations that, in calling for the removal of a special prosecutor there,Biden had leveraged his role as vice president to benefita Ukrainian energy company on whose board his son sat. Butthere was no there there. Weconcludedthat Biden had \"acted in accordance with and in furtherance of an official United States policy.\"The history of impeachment also offers no basis for proceeding in this regard. That includes examples like the inquiry into President Richard Nixon and the second Trump impeachment. Nixon was anunindicted co-conspiratorin his case over serious criminal allegations ofconspiracy and obstruction of justice, among others.In contrast, the evidence unearthed by the congressional investigations so far suggests no such wrongdoing on the part of Joe Biden. If the Republicans had more evidence, we would likely know about it. So far, all signs are that they have a comparative nothingburger.As if to confirm the rightness of Trump's second impeachment, the former president Trump was latercharged with a litany of offenses, including conspiracy to defraud the United States through post-election misconduct along with other federal and state crimes. (Trump has maintained he did nothing wrong.)If all that were not enough, there's another legal infirmity in an impeachment charge. The elder Biden's involvementwith his son's business occurred when he was vice president, not president.An impeachment proceeding based on this conduct would be the first in our nation's history not premised on conduct occurring during the subject's presidency. These areuntestedlegal waters, and it's far from clear that the framers of the constitution intended for impeachment to cover activity from before a presidency begins and that is unrelated to winning it.The proposed Biden impeachment is a revenge mission and nothing more. Like many things born in retaliation, it is fatally flawed. It should not proceed.Opinion by Norman EisenTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
