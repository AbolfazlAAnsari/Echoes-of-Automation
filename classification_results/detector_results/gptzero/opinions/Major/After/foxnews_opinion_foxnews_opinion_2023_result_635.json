Fox reports, \"There are now 39 universities in 17 states with emergency contraceptive vending machines, and at least 20 more considering them, according to the American Society for Emergency Contraception.\"This isn’t new. Reckless distribution of Plan B was opposed by then President Barack Obama, who worried about selling such drugs next to candy as young girls \"may not be able to understand the medicine's labeling or use the pill properly,\" noted the Associated Press in 2011.COLLEGES BEGIN TO USE VENDING MACHINES TO SELL MORNING-AFTER PILLNothing says casual distribution like life-ending drugs next to the soda machine to help wash them down.Reporters covering this story often ask me if Plan B is better than nothing. No, it’s not – it’s much worse.The social construct ofthe abortion lobbypreaches that the only \"bad\" consequence of sex is the presence or absence of a baby. This is leading to the casual distribution of Plan B exposing young women to dangerous people, to unknown physical consequences, and to the current epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).First, dangerous people. It’s a bit schizophrenic for campuses to condemn rape culture and sexual pressure, grappling with Title IX protections for the abused, while also ensuring that sexual bullies have easy access to a product that covers up their crimes. A medical community that cared about women would want to make sure women were not being coerced and fully informed about the drugs offered. Instead, news sites are littered with stories of abusers using the drugs to hide from their crimes.Second, informed consent. Usually, healthcare providers tell you about what drugs will do to you … unless, apparently, it impacts your fertility. Women should know that right on the box, it’s explained Plan B can prevent a new life from implanting in the womb, notes the Mayo Clinic. Such life-ending properties need to be understood by the young women sold the drugs, along with better information on the effects of repeated doses of a mega hormone cocktail that can \"turn your hormones upside down.\" Even proponents of it acknowledge a lack of thorough testing.It's tragically fascinating to see an acne drug, Accutane, so closely controlled because it can impact the preborn, while medical professionals hide from the scientific reality of how Plan B or a copper IUD (also used in a Plan B like way, according to the CDC) can end young life.A person demonstrates how to purchase a carton out of the \"morning-after\" pill, Plan-B, vending machine that sits in the basement of the student union building on the Boston University Campus in Boston, Massachusetts on July 26, 2022. - Each carton contains a single pill and cost $7.25 US and is available at all times to students.

Consider that today, one in five Americans has an STD, according to the CDC. About half of new cases are suffered by the college age cohort with a cost of $16 Billion in direct medical care costs. Add to that the epidemic of new cases, with some drug resistant and incurable, and the social costs of pretending that pregnancy is the only impact really add up.When it comes to sex, school officials seem determined to assume that while teaching the next generation is their job of choice, they can’t explain good relationship advice or health information that doesn’t embrace a Planned Parenthood mindset.That’s not the approach taken with other known – even dangerous – behaviors among college students. Despite their defeatistattitudes on sex, schools don’t offer drunk driving classes, BYOB, so students can practice avoiding pedestrians.A condom, Plan B, or the pill can’t protect anyone from a broken heart. Celebrating the kind of relationship skills that lead to home and family is important for individuals and the nation as this anti-baby, even anti-family bias may explain our shrinking population.There is so much more to building a life than what the vending machine salespeople will admit to, and so much more risk for young people than they are being told. Plan B Vending machines are a mistake that colleges don’t have to make.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM KRISTAN HAWKINSKristan Hawkins is president of Students for Life of America and Students for Life Action, with more than 1,400 groups on middle and high school, college and university, medical and law school campuses in all 50 states.
