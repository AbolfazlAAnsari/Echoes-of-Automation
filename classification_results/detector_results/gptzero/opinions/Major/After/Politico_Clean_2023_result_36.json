            "inputText": "Resume inflation on Capitol Hill is getting out of hand.The verdant canopy of lies tended by Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) requires no summary here. They're so thick and leafy that they now block the sun from the forest floor. But he's not the only freshman member who struggles when self-reporting. According to a recent Washington Post investigation, Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) can't keep her ethnicity straight, claims to have grown up destitute and neglected when she didn't, and appears to have incorrectly portrayed herself as the victim of a home invasion. (Luna has contested the Post story and won one correction and a clarification.) Meanwhile, Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) has claimed to be an economist (he's not), re-rendered his minor position as a reserve sheriff's deputy into a career as a crime-fighter cracking down on sex trafficking, and inflated his participation in non-degree classes at Vanderbilt and Dartmouth into claims of having attended their graduate schools.Is a \"Fib your way to Congress\" trend emerging? Do the Santos, Luna and Ogles stories mark a failure of the press to fully vet candidates before Election Day? Or have candidates always embellished their pasts and gotten away with it until the Internet made it cheap and speedy to check their records? Or does this mini-epidemic of resume packing and fictionalized autobiographies point to something more revelatory - that everybody does it and accurate resumes and personal histories don't matter when it comes to electing politicians?Liars are supposed to appall us, but in practice, they don't. America loves its scoundrels. F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, which is about a prolific liar, ranks near the top polls of America's best-loved novels. Its enduring lesson teaches that if you can't make it, fake it, and nobody will be any the wiser by the time you succeed. Spoiler alert if you slept through high school English: Gatsby climbs to the top by lying about his name (it's James Gatz), the origin of his wealth (bootlegging; moving counterfeit stocks; bribing public officials; working with gangsters), and his past (he was born poor in North Dakota, not rich in San Francisco). He ultimately gets knocked off, not in comeuppance for his lies, but in an act of revenge. (His killer mistakenly thinks Gatsby hit and killed his wife in traffic when actually Gatsby's mistress Daisy was the wheelwoman.) The moral of The Great Gatsby is if you want to get ahead in American life, lie profusely - but make sure your sweetheart drives safely.The Gatsby Directive has long been observed in corporate America, with executives routinely getting busted for resume padding. Academia, too, is shot through with professors who doctor their curriculum vitae. And you could fill a roadside Little Library with bestselling memoirs that turn out to be fake. In spinning their exaggerations and embroideries to political success, Santos, Luna and Ogles resemble President Joe Biden, who has dispensed one large dip of double-fudge after another throughout his entire political career. In a recent unrelenting column, the Washington Post's Marc A. Thiessen truth-squaded Biden. The president's many lies include those about his family history; about his college achievements; about getting arrested while trying to visit Nelson Mandela in prison; about getting arrested for protesting civil rights; about getting arrested for sneaking into the U.S. Capitol; about getting shot at inside Baghdad's Green Zone; about pinning a Silver Star on a Navy Captain in Afghanistan; about cutting the federal deficit in half. And that's just a partial list.Of course, the volume and scale of Biden's lies don't compare to those of Donald Trump, who completely untethered himself from the truth during his administration. According to the Washington Post's Fact Checker column, Trump made at least 30,573 false or misleading comments during his four years in the White House. Trump maintained such a unique relationship with the truth that it might have been simpler for the Post to tabulate his truthful statements than his lies. When the fact-checker first got going at Trump during the 2016 campaign, it looked like their accountings would fracture his credibility with voters, but it didn't - or at least not enough to turn the election. Trump supporters discounted the fact that he was full of it because they liked many of the things he said about immigrants, foreign entanglements, Hillary Clinton, trade, economic growth and race. The same - although on a radically different scale - appears to be true with Biden supporters. When Joe blunders or overstates, they cover for him by saying, \"Oh, that's just Joe,\" and change the subject.If Santos, Luna and Ogles studied the political career of Donald Trump before composing their personal histories, nobody should be surprised. Trump established that while journalists care about the truth, voters can be more forgiving. If voters cared that much about campaign lies, the Democrats would have made the 2020 election an exercise in public shaming about Trump's lies. But they didn't. The only lies politicians must avoid are the ones that might trigger legal proceedings against them, like the iffy campaign finance statements Santos filed that have spurred investigations and might result in prosecution. Garden variety lies that aren't prosecutable are regularly forgotten by voters by the time their speakers run for reelection.Politicians lie, lie and lie some more because they've learned voters seem not to care much about it when the lies are uncovered. (In a perfect world, the press would fully vet every politician's every statement, but even before the industry's decline it didn't have the resources to perform mass lie detection.) In the long run, voters seem not to care whether a candidate's credentials are legitimate or if they really climbed Mt. Everest in their stocking feet as they attest on the husting. So why bother fluffing your resume in the first place if voters will only shrug when they discover you stretched the truth? Could it be that, like committing minor acts of vandalism or petty shoplifting, telling lies about ourselves feels too good to resist, especially when engaged in the contest that is politics, where every day brings another public exercise in resume comparison?When it comes to politics, a candidate's lived experience should be less important than where they stand on the issue. For that reason alone, we'd be better off if politicians competed by deflating their resumes instead of ballooning them.******I do, however, want my neurosurgeon's resume to be accurate.
