In one message, Bradley said that it \"absolutely\" began before Willis employed Wade in November 2021.But then Bradley ​contracted courtroom-induced amnesia. Frustrated, Merchant told McAfee: \"Judge, he doesn’t remember much of anything right now.\"Memories fade. But, alas for Willis and Wade, phone bills are forever.Wade’s cell phone records are highly incriminating. They show some 2,000 calls and 10,000 text messages between Willis and Wade. They communicated non-stop, with the frenzied back and forth of teenagers in heat.KEY WITNESS IN FANI WILLIS CASE TESTIFIES HE MAY HAVE LIED IN TEXTS ABOUT FRIENDS' AFFAIREven more revealing are the location data from Wade’s cellphone. They confirm thatWade repeatedly showed upat Willis’ home ’round midnight and then went home by the dawn’s early light.Willis seems to have recruited Wade in exchange for sexual favors and financial benefits, namely Earth-shaking assignations and splashy vacations. This was a giant sexual kickback scheme — call it play to pay — all financed with Fulton County, Georgia’s tax dollars.Did they burn the midnight oil reviewing documents and plotting trial procedures or were other things afoot by candlelight?Wade and Willis testified that they \"did not sleep together\" before Willis hired Wade.As the late, greatDr. Henry Kissingerwould have put it, this most likely \"has the added advantage of being true.\" These visits in the wee small hours involved little, if any, actual sleep.The opposing counsel should have asked the obvious question as directly as this: \"Did you two have sex before Willis employed Wade?\"Of course, Willis paid Wade an enormous sum to argue a complex Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) case against a former president of the United States. This is the legal equivalent of starring in the flying trapeze. Wade seems better equipped to drive a clown car. Nonetheless, he got paid like P.T. Barnum.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION​Wade has earned some $654,000 fromWillis’ case against Trumpsince January 2022. Fishier still, Willis paid Wade $250 per hour in November and December 2021 while disbursing only $150 per hour to John Floyd, reputedly Georgia’s go-to RICO expert, according to a contract secured by The Daily Caller News Foundation.Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade.(Getty Images)Wade then spent part of this bonanza to take Willis on cruises, afabulous weekend in Napa Valley, and other hot times in posh spots.Willis seems to have recruited Wade in exchange for sexual favors and financial benefits, namely Earth-shaking assignations and splashy vacations.This was a giant sexual kickback scheme — call it play to pay — all financed withFulton County, Georgia’s tax dollars.If Willis hired her boyfriend, then this is corruption.If Willis hired Wadeand thenstarted copulating with him, then this sounds like sexual harassment: A boss knocking boots with an employee over whom she wields professional and economic power.This is either a kickback scam or Me Too in reverse.Which is it, Fani?Willis and Wade should be booted from this case. Indeed, this entire stinking wreck should be dismissed and Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, Sidney Powell, Harrison Floyd, Michael Roman, and the other defendants who are being persecuted — or who already have pleaded guilty — should have their charges dropped, their legal fees reimbursed, and profound apologies rendered by people of Fulton County.
