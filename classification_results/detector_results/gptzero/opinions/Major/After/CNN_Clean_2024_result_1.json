TheB-737 collided with the Metrolineralmost immediately after touchdown.This accident was the catalyst fora series of procedural and technological changes. One example of a change was to prohibit controllers from taxiing an airplane onto a runway for takeoff at night or during low visibility weather.Although the Los Angeles accident occurred in the United States, most of the aviation world took note. Pilots have become hypersensitive to remaining on an active runway waiting for takeoff clearance longer than a minute. And controllers have become hypersensitive to procedures that involve clearing an airplane to land with an airplane on the same runway awaiting takeoff.Haneda Airport is one of thebusiest in the worldwith nonstop radio chatter, and it's possible a traffic controller's message was misunderstood and one of the planes was in the wrong place. Normally, a clearance is read back and acknowledged by a pilot, but on busy transmission occasions there might not be an opportunity to immediately provide feedback. Sometimes a transmission gets blocked by another airplane at a critical time, which makes it important for both pilots and controllers to be situationally aware. Only one transmission can happen at a time.Another scenario is that the pilots of the Airbus A-350 lined up for the wrong parallel runway. I find that less likely because at least one pilot in the cockpit should have caught the error, notwithstanding that the air traffic controller would have noticed.Additionally, procedures in Japan are virtually the same as in the US; air traffic controllers are very competent and regimented. Out of all the international destinations to which I flew, Japan was one of the safest.No doubt, the investigation into the Haneda Airport accident will reveal the missteps that led to the collision. To be certain, many factors will be involved. Somewhere within those factors will be a human element. We'll need to give the accident investigators time to reach a likely probable cause or causes, with the objective of preventing such tragedies in the future.Flying to Tokyo? Don't hesitate to board the airplane. I would.Opinion by Les AbendTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
