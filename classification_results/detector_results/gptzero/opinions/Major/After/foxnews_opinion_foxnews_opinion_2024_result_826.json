OK, not for everyone. But members of Gen Z are getting a bad reputation when it comes to employment. It looks like it’s time forBoomers to step inand help out again. As much as Gen Z hates it.A new survey from Intelligent.com reads like an indictment of younger workers. There were lots of bad numbers, but here are two to really notice: \"38% of employers avoid hiring recent college graduates in favor of older employees\" and \"58% sayrecent college graduatesare unprepared for the workforce.\"When nearly 40% of employers are avoiding your entire demographic group, that’s a problem. But that’s the result of a survey of \"800 U.S. managers, directors, and executives who are involved in hiring.\" Welcome to the era of TikTok ruining careers – not just for those who post insipid job comments, but those who post are causing collateral damage across an entire generation.HOW GEN Z AND MILLENNIALS WANT TO WORK IN 2024: 'LAZY GIRL JOBS,' 'BARE MINIMUM MONDAYS' — AND LESSGen Z members (I’m told they don’t like the term \"Zoomers\") fall in the age range of 11 to 26, so only a small number of them have hit the workforce. So far, the work world is hitting back … hard. Turns out, what younger people call \"adulting\" and we used to call growing up, well it’s tough.Yeah, we know. It always has been, for every generation.A Reddit thread from 2022 was headlined, \"Holy sh--. Adulting is hard.\" It has nearly 28,000 up votes and more than 3,000 comments. Other similar threads were almost as popular – like \"Adulting sucks\" and \"Can't handle adulting.\"BOOMERS WERE RIGHT! 5 THINGS ABOUT ADULTING NO ONE WANTS YOU TO KNOWI won’t try to address all of the problems of life here. So let’s just focus on work. Because if you don’t have a job, all the other problems get much worse – bills, healthcare, dating, renting and even owning pets. Turns out your dog Max expects to get fed. And, if you have kids, they will insist on food, as well. Kids are funny that way.Much of the problem stems from the bad advice Gen Z is getting and a lot of it comes from the Chinese spy app TikTok. Workers are being told toquit without giving two weeks’ notice, which will likely come back and bite you. And they complain about low pay or are encouraged to take so-called \"lazy girl jobs\" that the Guardian described as \"jobs that are undemanding but well enough paid, with little personal passion involved.\"Even the U.S. Army is facing a\"TikTok mutiny\"because Gen Z recruits aren’t happy with either food or pay. Apparently, some recruits never saw a war movie or Googled ‘Army life.\"FORGET ‘QUIET QUITTING,’ NOW THERE'S ‘RAGE APPLYING’ — HERE'S WHY THE LATEST WORKPLACE TREND MATTERS SO MUCHSome new workers arewhining about working 9-5,like they are Dolly Parton fans. \"How am I supposed to fit my whole life into a 9-to-5 work schedule?\" recent grad Piper Hansen asked. She referred to a viral video whereanother Gen Z-er complained:\"I want to shower, eat my dinner and go to sleep. I don't have time or energy to cook my dinner either. Like, I don't have energy to work out, like that's out the window. Like, I'm so upset.\"One recruiter found a Gen Z intern who wanted to work just five hours a day and expected a lot of money to do it. InFeedo’s Sameera Khan explained on X back in July, \"I was interviewing a GenZ intern today and he says he is looking for work life balance with not more than 5 hours of work.\" He added, \"Also, wants 40-50k stipend. God bless the future of work.\"Unfortunately for Gen Z, perception soon becomes reality. Stories like these became commonplace. \"Silence of the Lambs\"star Jodie Foster publicly complainedthat Gen Zers in Hollywood can be \"really annoying\" in \"the workplace.\" (Movie fan note: Foster is also stunning with Denzel Washington and Clive Owen in the amazing Spike Lee movie \"Inside Man.\")IS GEN Z UNPREPARED FOR THE WORKFORCE? EXPERTS WEIGH INFoster then targeted two of the ongoing criticisms of the younger set – laziness and poor grammar. \"They’re like, ‘Nah, I’m not feeling it today, I’m gonna come in at 10.30am.’ Or, like, in emails, I’ll tell them this is all grammatically incorrect, did you not check your spelling?
