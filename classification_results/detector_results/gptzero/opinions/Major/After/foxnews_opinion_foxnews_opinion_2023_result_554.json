Our plan was to leave 2,500 special operators as a quick reaction force. Joe Biden neither approved nor disapproved the plan, resulting in the loss of 11 Marines, a sailor and a soldier.As a contingency, if we had to evacuate, the 75th Ranger Regiment was to surround Bagram Air Base while we flew everyone out, and they would fold in at the end and exfil.Bidenâs team gave up Bagramto the Taliban before anything else, leaving us with no plan B.The additional U.S. Embassy evacuations in Ukraine, Belarus, Sudan, HaitiÂ and now Niger show Bidenâs failed foreign policy and weakness.
