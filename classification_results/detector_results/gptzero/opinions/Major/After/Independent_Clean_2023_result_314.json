The shocking reality is that London sees over4,100 deaths each yeardue to human-made vehicle fumes, including PM2.5 and NO2.Despite the commendable progress made thus far, air quality inLondon continues to fall shortof UK regulatory levels and remains a considerable distance from more stringent guidelines established by the World Health Organisation (WHO).Soberingly, unless additional measures are put in place, it will take London years to fully comply with these legal limits. The complex reality is that, regardless of Ulez compliance, air pollution hotspots will persist due to pinch points of congestion and slow-moving traffic whether the zone exists or not.Continued exposure is a significant threat for those who live, work, and breathe in these hotspots. To expedite progress, London’s mayor,Sadiq Khan, must utilise and allocate the monthly revenue generated by Ulez, estimated at £26m after its first month, wisely.Promises to add and invest in traditional transport frameworks are undoubtedly essential, but we must go beyond the basics to reduce car usage and alleviate congestion to ultimately, prevent air pollution.It would be a missed, and frankly callous, act to allow preventable illness to persist when the technology and innovative solutions exist to turn the tide on air pollution. Ulez marks the beginning of the capital’s resolute commitment to confront the largest environmental threat to human health.Thomas DelgadoFounder and CEO of Pollution Solution"
