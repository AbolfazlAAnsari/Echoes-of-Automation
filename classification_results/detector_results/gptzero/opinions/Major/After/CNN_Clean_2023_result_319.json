Last August,DeSantis suspendedAndrew Warren, a Democrat duly elected as state attorney (aka district attorney) in Hillsborough County, Florida. The suspension came soon after Warrenspoke outagainst states passing strict abortion laws in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v.

(However, the judge still ruled against Warren, stating helacked the authorityto order reinstatement; that part of the decision is currently on appeal.) DeSantis, through his counsel, has said the suspension is a state matter that the federal courts have no business refereeing.Removing an elected prosecutor for political reasons is a stunning abuse of power, but it's merely the latest in a litany of condemnations the governor has received from the courts, signs of his remarkable disdain for the law he is sworn to uphold.

(Floridaisappealingthesecases.)And DeSantis has targeted businesses who dare defy him, most notablyDisney. His war on the entertainment giant started after the company spoke out in March 2022 against an act, dubbed the\"Don't Say Gay\" lawby critics, that prohibits\"classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity\" from kindergarten through high school per its recent expansion. It has since ballooned into a bare-knuckled confrontation of competing lawsuits, which includeDisney's claimsthat DeSantis has violated the company's First Amendment rights. (ADeSantis aide slammed the Disneysuit as \"yet another unfortunate example of their hope to undermine the will of the Florida voters.\")Then there are DeSantis' public boasts about the brazen arrests and prosecutions offormerly incarcerated citizensseeking to vote. Under pressure to play to the false claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, hecreatedan election police unit that arrested 20 citizens formistakenly votingdespite having prior convictions that made them ineligible. Prosecuting these already vulnerable individuals, at least some of whom weregiven voter registration cardsby the state, is unethical and outrageous. Judges have already thrown out several of these cases.DeSantis' record reveals a modern-day Machiavelli. Nowhere is this better exemplified than hisinfamous stuntusing Florida tax dollars to deceive nearly 50 migrants into boarding a plane from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, with empty promises of employment and housing, an antic that prompted investigations bycountyandfederalauthorities.That includes a criminalinvestigationby local Texas authorities. While they have said DeSantis himself is not one of their targets (he did not personally set footin the jurisdiction), his role in fostering a scheme that raises questions of criminal violations is a badge of shame. DeSantis, however, hasdefended his actions, saying the migrants were offered greater resources in Massachusetts.Instead of being chastened by these many clashes with the law, DeSantis has been emboldened. He recently signed into law aneducation reform billthat has terrified schools intoremoving booksand other instructional materials from the classroom and school libraries for vetting by authorities. That includes the recentrelocation of the poemwritten and read by Amanda Gorman at President Joe Biden's inauguration. The legislation has createdmassive confusionover what materials are permissible and the process for approval, placing undue strain on Florida's public education system.Like Trump on steroids, DeSantis has advanced his political ambitions by attacking his opponents, playing to the lowest common denominator, engaging in political stunts and even violating the constitution. This should scare anyone who cares about free speech, the integrity of our elections or the rule of law - three fundamental values on which our nation is built.As the saying goes, \"When someone shows you who they are, believe them.\" As America struggles to overcome the divisiveness of the Trump era and to confront the challenges of tomorrow, we need representatives who embody our noblest qualities and core values, not those who sacrifice them for political expediency. We need courageous leaders, not carnival barkers. DeSantis has shown us who he is with a track record that should alarm every Floridian - and every American. We should believe him.Opinion by Andrew Warren and Norm EisenTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
