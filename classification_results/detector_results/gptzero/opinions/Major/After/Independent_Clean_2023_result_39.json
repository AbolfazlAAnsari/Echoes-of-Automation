But does it make any sense to keep a dangerous prisoner alive against their will at enormous expense to the taxpayer in asystem that is already overstretched?Susan AlexanderSouth GloucestershireOur natural disaster response must include wider human rightsMary Dejevsky is right to allude to theprofound political falloutof Turkey’searthquake.  We must not overlook the social, cultural, gender and economic fallout, too.The poor, marginalised and downtrodden disproportionately bear the brunt of natural disasters. They often live in shoddily constructed homes that are more vulnerable to earthquakes and are often victims of gender stereotypes, disparities and patriarchal societies.The lesson that could be gleaned from this human tragedy is that we should incorporate a human rights perspective into ournatural disaster response, as it enshrines the rights and dignities of already vulnerable peoples.Dr Munjed Farid Al QutobLondonBritain needs Heathrow’s expansionFurther to Helen Wilson-Beevers’article on Heathrow expansion, it’s worth recalling that the airport operated at 98 per cent capacity before the pandemic struck, and will do so again soon.IfHeathrowdoes not get another runway, then airlines will switch to other hub airports like Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. That won’t reduce one iota of carbon – it’ll make it worse.As Britain struggles to recover from Covid, the effects of war inUkraineand the cost of living crisis, the case forprivate sector-led economic growth becomes more important. Britain needs to trade. Its biggest port needs to grow.We can all agree that a new runway should not happen if it fails to meet the highest standards for air quality, noise and carbon reduction. Butparliamenthas already encased that commitment in law, in a vote in 2018 – approved by the Supreme Court.The “knowledge transfer” of Heathrow’s greener runway can be a gift to globalcarbon reduction in aviation.Its time has come.Parmjit DhandaExecutive director of Back Heathrow and former Labour government minister"
