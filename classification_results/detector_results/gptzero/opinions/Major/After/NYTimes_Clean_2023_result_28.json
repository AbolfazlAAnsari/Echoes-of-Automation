The U.S. is funneling increasingly powerful weaponry to the Ukrainian Army and shows no sign of stopping until Kyiv achieves its war objectives. American weapons, to put it bluntly, are killing Russian soldiers.But it’s important to note that the Biden administration has thus far been successful in treading the line between assisting Ukraine’s war effort and avoiding the kind of escalation that could draw NATO and Russia into a direct confrontation. The Russian Army has its hands full dealing with a vigilant, highly motivated Ukrainian military and is in no position to expand the war by fighting 30 NATO members simultaneously.Yet as worn out as the Russian Army is, the U.S. and its allies in Europe should not underestimate Vladimir Putin’s commitment to succeeding in the war — or at least producing something that can be sold as a win back home. This is why rumors ofsome U.S. officials supporting a Ukrainian military offensive into Crimeaare wholly irresponsible.Unlike other areas of Ukraine’s east and south, Russia has effectively controlled the strategic peninsula for nearly a decade.

Kathy Hochul and New York State’s acting health commissioner, Dr. James McDonald, in removing the mask mandate in health settings in the state.This will put medically fragile people and seniors at greater risk of Covid and its more dire consequences. The government has a responsibility to protect all of its citizens.Dr. McDonald admits that “the pandemic is not over.” Why then are decisions being made as though it is?The decision to leave masking rules up to each health facility is harmful and ill advised; it must be reversed.How much of an inconvenience is it to wear a mask for one hour for a doctor’s appointment, knowing that you could be saving someone’s life?Vitalah Gayle SimonArmonk, N.Y.Averting Future PandemicsTo the Editor:Your Feb. 5 Sunday Opinion section had articles on the U.S. pork industry by Nicholas Kristof (“Spy Cams Reveal Pork Industry Secrets”) and on the possibility of an avian influenza pandemic by Zeynep Tufekci (“The Next Pandemic Could Be Deadlier”).Mr. Kristof highlights the true costs of large-scale pig production, while Ms. Tufekci discusses the danger of H5N1 mutation through industrial poultry production.As someone who has worked since 2006 on avian influenza and emerging pandemic threats in Africa and Southeast Asia, I was struck by the relationship between these pieces. As we assess the risks of future pandemics, it is useful to take a step back to examine the underlying elements of the threat.The demand for animal protein and its production is a major source of risk for future influenza and coronavirus outbreaks. Since pigs and poultry are proven conduits for spillover to humans, viral surveillance at these production facilities must be a national and international priority.Jerry MartinGaithersburg, Md.The writer is former director of USAID’s Preparedness and Response Project.Turning to YouTube: Yes! Or Is It Maybe?To the Editor:Re “There Already Is a Better Search Engine Than Google, and It’s Not ChatGPT,” by Farhad Manjoo (column, Feb. 4):I am an 80-year-old woman living alone. I turn to YouTube first whenever something goes amiss in my home — mostly in the area of technology and sometimes even with recalcitrant appliances. I know enough to turn off the power sources to my appliances before I let YouTube help me do its magic.Aside from the feeling of satisfaction I get from solving an annoying problem, YouTube relieves me of the burden of calling my sons for help. Although they always are willing to come to my aid, I know how exasperating an elderly, needy mother can be.And besides, my sons are fast approaching the age where they too will have to turn to their super-savvy kids for help.Nancy WergelesMarina del Rey, Calif.To the Editor:While I absolutely agree that watching YouTube videos is very helpful to learn how to do a pirouette or fix the kitchen drainpipe, I take issue with it as a go-to research tool.There are already way too many kids (and probably adults) who have neither the ability or stamina to read through a lengthy article for you to suggest that they further reduce their skill level by having them learn from videos instead of words.This former English teacher encourages reading.Mindi Lo CiceroYonkers, N.Y.This article appeared in print on page A19."
