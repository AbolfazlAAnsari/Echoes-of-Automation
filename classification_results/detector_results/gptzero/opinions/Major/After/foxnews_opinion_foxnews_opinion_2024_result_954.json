There’s no balance.The Credit Karma study highlights the underlying motive for this new phenomenon. \"Nearly half (47%) of Gen Z say the older generation's obsession with work has made them rethink their career paths.\" In other words, they want something different.Unfortunately, the implication of Gen Z’s choice to lean back or lean out of the marketplace is that they’re lazy. But arethey?In a recent article in Time magazine, psychologist Vanessa Scaringi posits thatfinancial security, not the desire for a more balanced life, is the real reason women are opting out of the workforce. She claims they’re \"reverting to old-fashioned gender roles that allow them to be cared for [by men] instead of hustling.\"GEN Z EMPLOYEE IS ‘SHOCKED’ BY THE ‘DEPRESSING’ 9-TO-5 WORK SCHEDULEBut there’s much more here than meets the eye. From my vantage point, one overarching difference between Gen Z women and the women who raised them is that younger women want to live more female-friendly lives.Some of these women may be, as Scaringi suggests, overcorrecting by choosing to become what we’ve dubbed \"tradwives\" or \"softgirls,\" which represent an extreme version of leaning out. But all revolutions have a counterrevolution; most women want something in the middle.From my vantage point, one overarching difference between Gen Z women and the women who raised them is that younger women want to live more female-friendly lives.Gen Z women don’t want to live their mothers’ lives—they saw up close the burnout their mothers faced. Gen Z (and many millennials) wants what most women want: to bemarried with kidsand to live a regular old life. They don’t want to \"change the world\" the way their mothers did. They want to focus on their own little corner of the world.GEN Z OPTING FOR TEXTING DUE TO ‘PHOBIA’ OF PHONE CALLS, RESEARCH REVEALSI hear from these women every single day. Here’s a recent email:I was 1000% raised with the narrative that education and career were more important than relationships and family. I received my \"girlboss\" degree (aerospace engineering) and am still working full time; but instead of going ‘all in’ on that career, I poured myself into my relationship. If you would have told me when I started college that by 26 I’d find most of my fulfillment from family, friends, and building a life with my husband, I would have laughed you out of the room. I’m so lucky and grateful that you were honest with me about what my life might look like later. I can’t thank you enough for your work and for being one of the few media influences who told me the untrendy truth that the girlboss life isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.The modern generation of women was steered terribly wrong: They should not have been raised to prioritize career over love.

This one decision colors every other decision we make. What sense does it make, then, to not makefinding our personour first order of business?Most women still want to get married. And when they do, their priorities will change dramatically. No one wants to tell women that motherhood will change every professional plan they ever had, but it will. Life will open up in a new, exciting, and profound way; and the pursuit of a career will play second fiddle—as it should.There is much more to life than work, and Gen Z has discovered this early on. They’re not lazy for leaning out of the marketplace and putting life first.They’re smart.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SUZANNE VENKERSuzanne Venker is a marriage and relationship coach and host of the \"Suzanne Venker Show.\" Her latest book is\"How to Build a Better Life: A New Roadmap for Women Who Want to Prioritize Love and Family,\"(Post Hill Press, March 4, 2024).For more, visit her website:www.suzannevenker.com.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
