Please send your letters toletters@independent.co.ukWhy are theMetropolitan Policesuccumbing to pressure fromSuella Bravermanto challenge the rights of ordinary people to march andshow solidarity for those suffering in Gaza?The majority of thosemarching in Londonover the last three Saturdays would have shared the horror of theHamasattack onIsrael.I defend the right of anyone tomarch for peaceand like me, many thousands of ordinary people with a conscience showed their support for a full ceasefire. Not a “pause”.Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer both need to stop sitting on their hands and act. A ceasefire needs to be pursued by America, Britain and the EU before a muchbigger conflict eruptsin the Middle East. It’s time for our politicians to act as statesmen and stop sitting on the fence.Gordon RonaldHertfordshireWashing machines and the microplastic problemSome $7.1 trillion (£5.8 trillion). That’s how muchplastic pollutionwill cost society by 2040.Todaymicroplasticsare present in virtually every aspect of the global economy. However, the manufacturing, use, and disposal of textiles is a particularly alarming pathway for microplastics to enter the environment.Approximately 430 billion microfibres are released into the natural environment by thetextiles industryevery day.Textiles create 35 per cent of the world’s microplastic pollution too. Today some 60 per cent of textiles are now made from plastic fibres. And as a result, microplastics have become an almostubiquitous presencein industrial wastewater systems.Every time clothes are washed, up to 700,000 plastic fibres are released from washing machines and into waterways. This means our wastewater and sewer systems are the primary channel for microplastics entering the natural environment. Micropollutants may be miniscule in size, but their impact on the natural environment is colossal.The consequences for the planet and human health are profound. Research suggests that human exposure to microplastics could lead toâ€¯oxidative stress,â€¯DNA damage, and inflammation,â€¯among other health problems. This is concerning given microplastics have been found inhuman blood and lungs.Textiles have a seismic impact on water consumption too. Indeed some 2,700 litres of water are typically used to make the average cotton T-shirt. The finishing and dyeing of clothing is particularly water intensive.Legislation is vital but so too is action by the manufacturers of textile products. Textile manufacturers and fashion brands worldwide can work together to create a sustainable solution to stop microfibre pollution created in the textile supply chain from entering the environment. This means designing and adopting filtration technologies capable of stopping microplastic from entering the water systems and capturing the material before it is either incinerated or ends up as sludge in farming fields.Vital too is reducing water consumption by recycling the water used throughout the textiles supply chain and injecting it back into the manufacturing process.Creating a real cradle-to-cradle economy in textiles is a profound opportunity for a world desperate to see the back of microplastic pollution.Adam RootCEO of MatterSick to the teethJust what are the Tories doing about dentistry? It is a total mess and there is no plan for improvement.I have worked all my life and paid all my taxes and national insurance as required, yet Icannot get treatedunless I go private. My case isnow the normacross the whole country, so what will the government do? They can either:1. Pay dentists more to treat NHS patients, or2. Give an annual tax refund to everyone so that they can afford to go private.One thing is clear, the Tory government has shafted us all, they have taken our taxes but denied us dental treatment.Get it fixed Sunak, this is an utter disgrace!Dale HughesAddress SuppliedWe’re happy to be held to accountWe [Nursing and Midwifery Council] exist to protect the public, so it’s right we’re held accountable, including through The Independent’s recent articles about us. I’d like to elaborate on some aspects for readers’ clarity about what’s happened and what we’re doing about it.The first article, “NHS regulator’s ‘culture of fear’ that leaves rogue nurses free to abuse patients” questions the outcomes of some fitness to practice cases we’ve investigated. It also shares concerns about our culture, based on a report that The Independent said we kept secret. For clarity, this was a report we commissioned to explore feedback from one of our teams, and those colleagues shared views on the basis we’d keep them confidential.The follow-up, “Nursing watchdog accused of discrimination for letting racism complaints ‘go unchecked’” suggests we’ve yet to achieve a safe, fair, and inclusive working environment. I’m very sorry for the impact this has had on colleagues, and I recognise that each of them needs to thrive to deliver on our primary purpose of protecting the public.We’ve now appointedIjeoma Omambala KCto lead two investigations – one into our handling of the concerns when they were first raised to us, and another into the fitness to practice cases highlighted. A separate external investigation will focus on the concerns raised about our culture. We’ll be transparent about the findings.Separately, I’d like to respond to the most recent article, “Nursing watchdog failing to investigate thousands of complaints amid concerns rogue staff going unchecked”. We receive thousands of fitness-to-practice referrals every year, and each one is assessed in line with our published screening guidance.The article questions whether we’re “rejecting” people’s concerns for the wrong reasons. We only close a concern if it’s the right thing to do. Last year, an external review of a sample of 50 case closures found that our decisions were appropriate and proportionate, and there were no concerns that we were failing to meet our duties to protect patient safety and uphold the wider public interest. This is referenced at the end of The Independent’s article.Readers can find our full responses to each article onour website.  In the meantime, I offer my personal commitment to responding to these concerns with care, rigour and a commitment to keeping people safe.Andrea Sutcliffe CBEChief executive and registrar, Nursing and Midwifery Council"
