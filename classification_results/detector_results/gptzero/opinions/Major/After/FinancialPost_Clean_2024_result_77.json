            "inputText": "By Allan LanthierAs readers will know, the federal government has announced an increase in capital gains taxes(https://financialpost.com/personal-finance/taxes/should-not-wag-tail-investment-dog-trudeau-wants) on corporations, trusts and wealthy Canadians to help pay for billions of dollars of new spending. The government frames the proposal as a fairness initiative.Although it has little to do with fairness, it is clever: carefully designed so Ottawa can say it will deliver on its \"fiscal anchors\" in 2024-2025. But the cost of doing so is to force taxpayers to make hasty decisions about whether or not to sell capital assets within the next few weeks.At present, one-half of capital gains(https://financialpost.com/tag/capital-gains/) is included in income and taxed accordingly. Under the budget proposal(https://financialpost.com/tag/federal-budget-2024/), the inclusion rate will increase to two-thirds effective June 25th, though in the case of individuals only for annual capital gains that exceed $250,000.More about the $250,000 exemption in a moment, but why the ten-week delay until June 25th? The government says it is to give people time to consider their investments and do what is best for them. Nonsense. The real reason is to allow the government to use accounting chicanery and keep its projected deficit for 2024-2025 a tad below $40 billion.The budget projects revenue of $19.4 billion from the measure over the next five years, $6.9 billion of which is in the current fiscal year. The reason the amount is so high in 2024-2025 is that many taxpayers will take advantage of the ten-week window to realize capital gains and pay tax at the current lower inclusion rate. For many, the sensible answer to the government's offer of \"pay now or pay more later\" will be to pay now.Not that the government will actually collect anything close to $6.9 billion, mind you. It is impossible to predict how many Canadians will decide to trigger immediate taxation, and this uncertainty gave Department of Finance officials a wide range to play with in its budget projections.\"I just want to find 11,780 votes\", Donald Trump told election officials in Georgia in January 2021. Here at home, Chrystia Freeland just wanted to find projected tax revenue of $6.9 billion for the current year and find it she did. No other tax measure - be it a wealth tax or an excess profits tax - could have delivered this accounting result.But the proposal means that taxpayers must decide whether or not to realize capital gains before June 25th and in effect prepay their taxes at the existing one-half inclusion rate. Those who do must take a calculated risk. Draft legislation was not released with the budget, and no one knows what the final rules will be. The budget simply says: \"additional design details will be released in the coming months.\"The government might conclude that the $250,000 annual exemption should also apply to corporations and trusts. After all, many \"mom and pop\" corporations have investment portfolios to help fund their owners' retirements. Or perhaps growing opposition to the measure will force the government to introduce additional exceptions or even abandon the proposal altogether. Alternatively, planning strategies may be developed that allow families to multiply the annual exemption and claim it year after year.In short, it's possible to imagine any number of situations where many people will have prepaid taxes needlessly.Is the proposal really about fairness, or is the government simply taking this opportunity to suggest that the wealthy are tax cheats? The $250,000 exemption is a clue. More than 31 million Canadians file personal tax returns each year. The government says only 40,000 of us have annual capital gains above $250,000, and it is those 40,000 who will pay the entire tax bill. (In fact, that is not accurate: about 300,000 corporations have capital gains each year, and many of these are small businesses.)Real fairness would have meant increasing the capital gains inclusion rate for everyone, not just 40,000 of us. Those with lower incomes would pay modest amounts of tax on any such gains, while those in the top tax brackets would pay significantly more. Such a measure would have raised even more revenue than the government's proposal, with the wealthy still paying the lion's share.Gatekeepers go for widespread 'unlocking' in budget 2024(https://financialpost.com/opinion/unlocking-in-federal-budget-2024)The hidden budget assumption most commentary missed(https://financialpost.com/opinion/hidden-federal-budget-assumption-most-commentary-missed)Government earns another 'D' for federal budget(https://financialpost.com/opinion/grading-federal-budget-government-earns-another-d)Instead, we have a proposal that allows the government to continue its political narrative that there are two classes of Canadians: more than 99 per cent of us who pay our \"fair share\" of taxes and 40,000 who do not. This from a government that prides itself in \"inclusion\" and accuses its opponents of \"dividing Canadians.\"Financial PostAllan Lanthier, a retired partner of an international accounting firm, has been an adviser to both the Department of Finance and the Canada Revenue Agency.Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the business news you need to know - add financialpost.com(https://financialpost.com/ ) to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here(https://financialpost.com/newsletters/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2024 Postmedia Network Inc.
