The PLA’s top priority is to rapidly apply AI to its missions and achieve what the leadership calls \"intelligentization\" of warfare. There is no visible framework of trustworthy, transparent or ethical Chinese military restraint to match the caution and control exercised over commercial companies developing AI in China.By contrast, this year the U.S. published robust regulations on military AI, even as Microsoft (Open AI) released ChatGPT-4 with no U.S. government regulation of the private sector. In January 2023, the Pentagon published \"Autonomy in Weapon Systems,\" stipulating they be under the control of humans, transparent, explainable, have top cyber protections, clear feedback loops, and be able to be turned off.U.S. military AI systemsmust also meet ethical requirements, meaning they are responsible, equitable, traceable, reliable and governable.  There is nothing like this to govern AI use by the PLA.Yet, whenChatGPT was releasedupon the world, the U.S. government had nothing new in place to reduce the harms of such a powerful AI model.AI COMPANIES RISK US NATIONAL SECURITY BY WORKING WITH CHINA. TIME TO CHOOSE SIDESBecause expensive computing power is the secret to AI innovation, cutting-edge models are in the hands of relatively few commercial actors like Google and Microsoft (through Open AI). They compete for market advantage, heedless of the dangers to the public, and the U.S. government is years behind them. The European Union has had an AI Act ready to go for two years; but the EU legislation lags recent developments and will not even take effect until 2025.What risks are China and the U.S. taking in their contrarian approaches? China is slowing down AI innovation in its domestic sphere. Pressured to answer ChatGPT (which is not available in China), Baidu rushed out its own large language model in March 2023.But Ernie Bot is years behind Open AI’s ChatGPT, makes a lot of mistakes, is available only to select Chinese companies, and was a disappointment to most Chinese observers. Those who fear U.S. domestic regulation will enable China to charge ahead have not paid attention to their stringent domestic regulations.WHAT IS AI?At the same time, China is not gaining an unmitigated military advantage through flat-out pursuit of AI. China is moving fast at integrating AI capabilities into every aspect of their military operations, including information warfare, intelligence analysis, targeting, and fully autonomous weapons. But so is the United States. Smart guardrails on military AI help the United States make choices that are safer, more trustworthy, and better integrated with human decision-making in warfare. Obstacles to rapid U.S. military AI innovation are bureaucratic and cultural, not regulatory.Failing to put effective domestic AI regulations in place only hurts Americans. Accessible large language models can generate disinformation at enormous scale, code software for nefarious purposes, produce novel biological toxins, rapidly dislocate millions of workers, and destabilize democratic systems.Unless we act to protect Americans from the dangerous effects of untested AI models, then determining who is winning the U.S.-China military competition may be irrelevant.Audrey Kurth Cronin is Trustees Professor of Security and Technology and Director of the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Security and Technology at Carnegie Mellon University. Her career incorporates experience in both academic and policy positions, in the U.S. and abroad.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
