He has threatened that his 150,000 workers will strikeif necessary. \"This is our defining moment,\" FainannouncedTuesday.His union has withheld an endorsement for Biden in the upcoming 2024 election until the president offers clarity on what kind of support he willprovide for workersdealing with the potentially detrimental labor impact of the shift to building electric vehicles (EVs).Biden has spent much of his term harking back to the period from the 1930s to the 1960s when Democratic presidents, starting with Franklin D. Roosevelt, put themselves squarely on the side of organized labor. His efforts to combat inflation sidetracked some of this focus as prices became of increasing concern.Now the president faces a different kind of challenge. The contract negotiations pit two of his major imperatives against one another - his effort to vastly expand the production of electric vehicles and his struggle to strengthen unions.The \"car guy\"A self-described \"car guy,\" theCorvette-owningBiden secured passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which funnels billions of dollars into subsidizing the production of electric vehicles and charging stations. \"The great American road trip is going to be fully electrified,\"he promisedat the Detroit Auto Show last September.\"These investments are also tools - tools to fight against climate change: building cars with zero tailpipe pollution, running on a cleaner grid, making and inventing the technologies that are going to power the future.\"Biden, who alsopromisedduring his campaign to be the most \"pro-union president you've ever seen,\" has been eager, since defeating former President Donald Trump, to rekindle thestrong loyaltiesthat working-class America felt for the Democratic Party after FDR got Congress to pass theWagner Actin 1935, legislation that legitimated unions and created a National Labor Relations Board.Biden was five years old when President Harry Truman stunned the pollsters bydefeatingNew York Gov.Thomas Dewey, largely as a result of labor's support. Throughoutthe 1970s, when Biden was in the first phase of his US Senate career, organized labor provided votes, money, organization and political muscle that allowed liberalism to become a dominant force, as the historian Nelson Lichtenstein captured brilliantly in his book, \"State of the Union.\"They were even pivotal in helping build political strength for other issues, such as civil rights. PresidentLyndon B. Johnson, who certainly had his tensions with labor leaders such as the UAW'sWalter Reuther, still depended on the partnership to push through much of his Great Society in the 1960s. Without organized labor's support, for instance, the nation would never have had Medicare.Alternative to culture warSince the 1960s, most of the right's effort to appeal to working- and middle-class America has focused on culture war issues. By contrast, unions offer an economic appeal, striving to be the most powerful force for obtaining long-term job security, good benefits and decent wages.But starting in the 1970s, Democrats grew increasingly distant from organized labor. The breakdown of the relationship happened for many reasons. Most important was the shrinking size ofthe union workforce. It had swelled to more than30% by the post-WWII periodand has fallen toabout 10%in recent years, according to the US Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics.With the size of unions shrinking in the service and high-tech economy, Democratslooked elsewherefor political support, devoting more attention to issues that were not as critical to labor.At the same time, more Democrats embraced a Reaganite vision of the economy thatstressed the value of free marketsand deregulation, with unions often being seen as more of a problem than a solution to the economic struggles of middle America.In their effort to court the corporate world as well as the finance sector, Democratsdistanced themselvesfrom the concerns that had been the bread and butter of their coalition. And there were many moments in which organized labor expressed tepid feelings about Democrats, starting from the AFL-CIO's decisionnot to endorse either candidatein the 1972 election - a rebuke of Democratic nominee Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota - to ongoing tensions over issues such as civil rights, immigration and free trade.Presidents and LaborEach Democratic president, since Johnson, has faced moments of massive tension with labor. President Jimmy Carter perceived unions as one more entrenched interest group that had been part of the formula that led to the rise of an America led by President Richard Nixon.Carter, according to adviser Stuart Eizenstat, \"saw unions as just another interest group.\" He added, \"They did not have a special call on his heartstrings.\" Carter supported deregulation in numerous economic sectors and was lukewarm, at best, towardlegislation being demanded by unions.President Bill Clinton raised the ire of labor leaders by moving forward with the NAFTA free trade agreement since they feared that jobs would go to Mexico and, with Republicans in control of Congress,declaredin his 1996 State of the Union Address that the \"era of big government is over.\"President Barack Obama, the most progressive of the three, refused to push for the \"card check\" bill that labor was supporting in 2009, which would make it easier for unions to secure new members, and the White House backed theTrans-Pacific Partnership(TPP) that many unions feared would result in job losses to companies overseas.While Republican presidents since Ronald Reagan have spent immense energy attacking unions, New York Times reporter David Leonhardtwroteearlier this year, \"Modern Democratic politicians, on the other hand, have often sat out the political battle. Every Democratic president for decades, including Joe Biden, has said he favors a federal law to make it easier for workers to organize - and each of those presidents has failed to pass such a law.\"Democrats can't afford to alienate labor. Traditional manufacturing unions remain an extremely powerful force in the Democratic coalition, even if they are not what they once were. In key swing states such as Michigan, Democrats ignore unionsat their own peril.Newer unions in sectors such as health care have been extremely vibrant in recent years, attracting younger workers who have little experience with the union tradition even in their own families. High-profile strikes, such as the ongoing labor stoppage by theScreenwriters Guild of America, have drawn strong support and can become rallying points against the exploitation that many Americans perceive in the current economy.During his first two years as president, Biden followed through on his promise to back labor. He pushed for legislation that helped organized labor, including the pandemic relief package that offered financial assistance to union pension funds. The administrationcreated incentivesfor companies to hire unionized workers in Biden's legislation on infrastructure and manufacturing. On the first Labor Day that he celebrated from the Oval Office, Bidencalled unionsessential to \"counter corporate power, to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.\"Then, problems emerged. Bidenran into troubleby pushing through arailroad contractw in 2022 that several major unions opposed, but whichthe president favored, to avoid damaging the economy.A balancing actIn the coming weeks, the administration needs to figure out how Biden can bring together his environmental and labor goals. At a moment when the vote ofworking-class Americanswill be pivotal in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, Biden must continue to demonstrate his support. At the same time, it is vital that he not backtrack on his enormous push to deal with climate change, where new forms of transportation have been central to the goal of drastically cutting carbon emissions.Of course, the tensions between environmentalism and labor are nothing new. Democrats have been balancing these two constituencies since the 1960s, weighing the imperative ofcurbing environmental damageagainst the threat of job loss. Republicans have loved to exploit these fault lines, as Trumpdidin 2016 and 2020 by pitting anti-fracking activists against blue collar workers.As much as this balancing act poses a challenge to Biden, it also offers an opportunity for him to demonstrate that green jobs and good jobs can go hand in hand.The key will be for the administration to respond to UAW concerns about new EV battery factories. Given theenormous subsidiesthat the companies are receiving, labor leaders are insisting that the people who will be building the batteries and cars should receive union protection and representation.Secretary of Energy and former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm hastried to assure the UAWthat the president can square the circle. Actually doing that will fall on the shoulders of Biden senior adviser Gene Sperling, who will be the point person for the White House in the UAW negotiations.Should the effort succeed, the payoff could be huge. If Biden can show that labor and environmentalism are compatible, it will spread benefits all around and energize these constituencies for the 2024 election.If the effort fails, an administration already struggling with low approval ratings will be dealing with yet more disappointment and frustration within Democrats' ranks, right as Republicans ramp up their effort to win back control of the White House.Opinion By Julian Zelizer, CNNTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
