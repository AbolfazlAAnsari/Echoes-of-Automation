Though pandemic-induced deficits explain part of that, fully 58 per cent of the run-up in debt occurred before COVID. That deserves emphasis: our current debt problems are not mainly the result of the pandemic.Because both federal and provincial governments borrow - municipal governments not so much - Canadians face different government debt burdens depending on where they live.
