Yeah, it's that time again, the end is nigh all hope is lost. No, Steve Doocy didn't get his own show, although Bill Hemmer found out I've been stealing his running shorts from the break room. But forget about inflation or our increasingly bellicose adversaries. Pay no mind to fentanyl, the rising crime rate or drag queen story hour. That was a mistake.I'm talking aboutMother Nature, and, boy, it's become a mother. Of course, this real threat to humanity, it's never really gone away. Its delivery day just keeps getting changed. The New York Times delivers this ominous warning, Climate Change is Speeding toward Catastrophe, the Next Decade is Crucial, the U.N. panel says. \"Earth is likely to cross a critical threshold for global warming within the next decade and nations will need to make an immediate and drastic shift away from fossil fuels to prevent the planet from overheating dangerously beyond that level, according to a major new report released on Monday.\" A new report, right? Huh? It eerily sounds like the same one Al Gore and the rest of these lying, fear mongering ---- have been screaming at us for the last 40 years. Yeah!CALIFORNIA GOV. NEWSOM STRIKES DEAL TO PUNISH FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES AFTER FIRST PROPOSAL REJECTEDHey, but so what? Right? You peasants need to suffer, or the whole world will be doomed. Except that the Times drops this not so subtle caveat that contradicts the whole report. \"Many scientists have,\" you know they \"pointed out that surpassing the 1.5 degree threshold will not mean humanity is doomed.\" Wait a second, so, wait, we're not doomed? Holly ----. Why didn't you just say so to begin with? Now, I'm sure that this so-called threshold is arbitrary, just the thing every fear merchant can agree on. It's funny, though, the headline screams catastrophe, but then halfway through it, they say never mind.Climate change activists vandalizing a painting to bring awareness to climate change.(Letzte Generation)The shocking news isn't so shocking at all. Imagine if that's how I called 911, huh? Hello? Everyone's going to die. Why? My fan broke. What a bunch of shock blockers. Anyway, it's not as if there was ever any climate change before we all decided we were killing the planet. It's not like 12,000 years ago there was a giant glacier right where I'm sitting, but no one blamed that on one of my many yachts. But we've been down this road before, like, every few years, like, for my entire life, and I'm 85 years old. I know I look great, it's all about hydration and a healthy sex life. Isn't that right, Melinda?But these experts keep moving the goalposts because they're worse at predicting the end of the world than the Mayans. 2012 was the last time I donated to charity because I thought the world was ending. What's the point, huh? Kids are going to die. They pick the year everything ends, and then that deadline passes. Then, coincidentally,Greta Thunberg deletes her tweetabout it and the climate crooks have to pick a new date, and then they start fending for their doomsday fix once again. They say the sky is falling when the only thing falling is this guy on the stairs of Air Force One. Terrible, but how often are we to keep hearing this.GRETA THUNBERG TELLS 'VIEW' HOSTS THAT CLIMATE ACTIVISTS MUST NOW GO BEYOND 'LEGAL METHODS'ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ 2019:The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change?Yeah, right.

That's climate activism. Bottom line, you can never trust an addict, even a climate change one. The apocalypse is always around the corner, then we turn that corner and nothing.
