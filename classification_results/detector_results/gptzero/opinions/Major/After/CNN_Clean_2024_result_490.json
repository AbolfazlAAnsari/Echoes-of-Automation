However, the law, as reauthorized in April, does just that.The SenatepassedRISAAby a considerable margin (60-34)barely before the midnight deadlineon April 19. President Joe Biden swiftly signed the reauthorization of key intelligence surveillance powers. The vote occurred after intense deliberation andcongressional divisionregarding how to reformSection 702, which permits US intelligence agencies to collect communications data from certain targeted foreigners located outside the United States, but in practice allows intelligence agencies to spy on Americans.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA) and other intelligence agencies can conduct\"backdoor\"searches on Americans if they have communicated with or if their information is referenced by a so-called targeted\"foreign person.\"We also know from several nonprofit organizations thatpurely domestic communicationsare being collected under FISA Section 702. The US government has conductedmillionsof such queries on Americans over the years.Despite thescandalcaused by these practices, the existence ofirrefutable evidenceknown to Congress andcriticismfrom former - and possibly future - President DonaldTrump, a Republican House and Democratic Senate decided to extend Section 702 without protecting Americans from unconstitutional surveillance.Congress refused to include safeguards in the FISA amendment bill advanced by the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee, likerequiring intelligence agencies to obtain a warrantto query communications ofUS persons(with exceptions for emergencies) and prohibiting intelligence agencies frombuying your datafrom Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft and other commercial data brokers. The House passed theFourth Amendment is Not for Sale Act, which would ban intelligence agencies from buying data, and sent the bill to the Senate last month.A broad coalition of civil society organizations, such as theACLU, theBrennan Center for Justice,the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC)andElectronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)have strongly opposedRISAA, with EFF correctly noting that the law \"does everything BUT reform Section 702.\"RISAA has the potential to exacerbate the surveillance situation for Americans in two ways. Thelawexpands the definition of \"electronic communication service provider\" toany service provider\"who has access to equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store wire or electronic communications.\"While the lawincludes exemptionsfor some public facilities, such as restaurants and community centers, the number of businesses and entities that offer a Wi-Fi connection means that intelligence agencies maycompelplaces such as airports, train stations, transport companies (trains, subways, buses) and shopping malls to convey their customers' communications data to intelligence agencies upon presentation of a directive requiring them to cooperate.This provision transforms a law intended to target non-US persons abroad into a domestic surveillance tool. FISA Title I protects US persons (definedas a US citizen, corporation, permanent resident or unincorporated association with a substantial number of US citizens or permanent residents) from unlawful surveillance by requiring the government to showprobablecausebefore the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), but Title VII, which contains the controversial Section 702 under whichwarrantlesssurveillance is conducted, does not. This law proves that the dichotomy between domestic and national intelligence is artificial since data flows have no borders and are collected regardless of nationality.This law therefore leaves Americans without the strong protections of FISA Title I andworsenstheir privacy and free-speech rights under the law and constitution. Trump's recent call to\"KILL FISA\"is not a stupid idea from a constitutional rights protection perspective, and especially the First Amendment.Despite the First Amendment, Congress provesonce againunable to refrain from making laws\"abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.\"Indeed, in spite of themultitude of evidencethat protesters, journalists and members of Congress have had their communications data searched under FISA Section 702, lawmakers decided to ignore their constitutional duty to protect Americans.This is not merely hypothetical. We know today on the basis of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court decisions and the 2023 Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB)reportthat constitutionally protected activities such as attorney-client communications, peaceful protests and political campaign donations are being monitored, along withactivities of racial and religious groups. The FBI conducted thousands of searches on people involved in civil unrest, social advocacy and government criticism, including Black Lives Matter protesters and protests related to the events of January 6, 2021, according to the PCLOB report, which highlights just a few examples we know of in a surveillance regime shrouded in secrecy.As aselling pointfor warrantless surveillance of Americans' communications, WIRED reported thatHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican, used pro-Palestinian protesters in the US as an example of movements that could be harmful to national security by alleging ties to Hamas. FISA Section 702, as extended by RISAA, would blatantly violate the First Amendment if applied as the congressman suggested. (Committee spokesperson Jeff Naft said the presentation was intended to show that protesters would not be a \"target\" under Section 702 even if there were Hamas connections in the movements.)When groups are initially targeted because of their speech, this causes a chilling effect on free speech and association throughout society. The chilling effect can lead to the downfall of a democratic and republican form of government. Under the Section 702 expansion, all Americans are in unprecedented danger of having their communications intercepted and searched by the government - so who would dare criticize the government?Some members of Congress know the danger of\"one of the most dramatic and terrifying expansions of government surveillance authority in history.\"Quite troublingly, they carved out an exception for themselves in the surveillance procedure. Intelligence agencies will have to notify lawmakers before spying on them - whileno notificationis extended to the more than 336 million Americans Congress has sworn to protect.That's why - problematically - Americans are rarely aware that their communications were monitored. In a handful of cases where Americans learned about surveillance and brought constitutional challenges, likeFBI v. Fazaga,United States v. Hasbajrami, andUnited States v. Muhtorov, courts have struck down these challenges in deference to intelligence agencies and national security.It is hard to obtain precise figures and a clear picture about the extent of the surveillance conducted by all intelligence agencies on Americans. The recentODNI reporthighlights the different methodologies used by each agency to count and report the surveillance of Americans on the basis of FISA Section 702. For instance, a query term may be used on 10 or more occasions, but is reported as only one.Surveillance has become ubiquitous, global and inescapable for innocent Americans. At the same time, safeguards are being lifted without substantial opposition from Congress, let alonethe executive branch. The likelihood of a Supreme Court decision on this matter in the near future is minimal. The court's demonstrated inclination to defer to the government in cases involving national security further diminishes the prospect that Section 702 would be struck down.If Americans cannot defend their own rights and legislators cannot confine surveillance within the limits of the Constitution, one may wonder if America is still the land of the free.Opinion by Nafees Syed and Kamel El HilaliTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
