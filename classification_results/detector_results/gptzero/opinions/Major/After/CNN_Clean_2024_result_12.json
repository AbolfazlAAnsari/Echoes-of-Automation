This phenomenon was precipitated partly by the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. The war in Iraq producedonly one real winner, Iran, according to the official US Army history of the conflict. Iran today continues to support militias in Iraq,according toa 2023 report prepared for the British House of Commons.In Lebanon, Hezbollah has received hundreds of millions of dollars from Iran, and thousands of its fighters have trained in Iranian camps,according tothe US State Department. In Syria, Iran also has considerable influence, and its own forces are based there.The Houthis in Yemenare armed and trained by Iran, while Hamas hasalso received arms from Iran.This all makes for a simmering mess, because while armed drones and proxy forces allow powers like the US, Israel and Iran to avoid all-out conventional wars, reliance on drones and proxies is also playing with fire as they move all these powers closer to all-out conflict. The history of warfare, after all, suggests that it is the most uncertain of human enterprises, and seemingly relatively unimportant events likethe assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinandin Sarajevo in 1914, which became a key trigger of World War I, can instigate broader conflicts.In Israel, there is nowa growing lobbyfor a war with Hezbollah, a far better armed and more militarily proficient force than Hamas. The last time that Israel and Hezbollahfought a full-scale war was in 2006, and the conflict was something of a draw.In Lebanon, there is little appetite for another war as the 2006 conflict destroyed a good chunk of the country,which is reelingfrom its current economic and financial crises.But warmay come anyway, given attitudes in Israel about the threat posed by Hezbollah andHezbollah's own increasingly strident responsesto Israeli attacks.In Washington, DC, the national security establishment has for many years focused on the rising threat posed by China, and every administration since President Barack Obama's has tried to lessen US involvement in the greater Middle East. Obama withdrew all US troops from Iraq in 2011, only to deploy American soldiers back to Iraq in 2014 to counter ISIS. President Donald Trump's team signed a withdrawal agreement with the Taliban in 2020, and President Joe Bidenwithdrew all US troopsfrom Afghanistan in 2021.Yet the United States keeps getting pulled back into the Middle East because of several factors, including its alliance with Israel, the central role that oil and gas play in the global economy and its longtime competition with Iran, none of which are going to change any time soon. The risk now is that a series of increasingly lethal attacks between Iranian proxy forces, and the US and its allies, including Israel, will embroil the region in a larger war.Opinion by Peter BergenTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
