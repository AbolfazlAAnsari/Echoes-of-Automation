Nikki Haley is facing what seems to be her do-or-die moment going into theNew Hampshire primaryon Tuesday.In a Thursday night town hall on CNN she was her usual confident, passionate, smart self. But, as has happened throughout this peculiar GOP primary season, there was something missing. Was she really going after the man she needs to beat? Was she really aiming to defeat former President Donald Trump?\"We want to dobetter than we did in Iowa, that's my personal goal.\" Once again, it sounded like she was aiming for second place.She has already lost Iowa handily, coming in third, behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, with both trailingTrump, who dominates the polls ofGOP voters. New Hampshire is the one early state showing her instriking distance, with amore moderate electorate than Iowa and a primarythat allows non-Republicans to vote. The Granite State would seem to give the erstwhile UN ambassador her best chance of beating her former boss and vaulting into serious contention for the party nomination.And yet, this is far from a normal election. After all, the leading GOP candidate is accused of trying to overturn America's democracy and has given every indication that if he became president again, his second term would bemore extremeand potentially athreat to US democracy.Among the many out-of-the-ordinary traits of the contest, Haley has essentially ignored the most salient features of the man she has to beat, a candidate so flawed that his former attorney general, Bill Barr, has warned that Trump \"will always put his own interests, and gratifying his own ego, ahead of everything else, including the country's interests.\"Again and again on Thursday, Haley missed the opportunity to strike Trump where he is weakest. \"There should be accountability\" was about as far as she would go in addressing the behavior that has landed the former president in legal quicksand.She could have mentioned the actions that resulted intwo impeachmentswhile he was president,a mountain of criminal and civil casesagainst him, more than adozen accusationsof sexual assault and his increasingly alarming rhetoric about plans toweaponize the governmentagainst his foes, or \"vermin,\" as he called some of them, once again using language favored by fascist propagandists. (Trump denies any wrongdoing.)Instead, Haley's offense mostly avoids the major flaws of her target. What passes for Haley's attacks against her rival, heralded by the press only because there have been so few before, are limp arguments about how \"rightly or wrongly, chaos follows [Trump].\"For a moment in the town hall, she did criticize some of Trump's policies, including his praise of Chinese leader Xi Jinping. But on his most fundamental failings, she remained silent.On many subjects Thursday night, Haley tried to lure independents, a big share of the New Hampshire electorate, at time sounding almost like a moderate campaigning in the general election rather than taking the highly partisan, increasingly extreme positions often heard in the primaries.But when it came to Trump, her calculated timidity persisted even as Trump has launched transparently racist attacks against her, calling her by her foreign-sounding first name,Nimarata, andfalsely claimingthe South Carolina native is not qualified to be president because of her parents' nationality at the time of her birth.When host Jake Tapper gave her the opportunity to call Trump out on his racist dog whistles, Haley downplayed what she labeled his \"name calling,\" saying it's what Trump does when he feels threatened.What's going on here? Is there any way that Haley can win the nomination without plunging her sword into any of Trump's gigantic vulnerabilities?Sure, there's an outside chance she canpull off an upset win, carry New Hampshire and pierce Trump's perceived cloak of invincibility, changing the course of the race. But there's another way Haley can emerge victorious. That way has more to do with forces outside her control, although she apparently believes it requires her to hold her fire against her principal rival to avoid alienating his supporters.While it's possible her reserve in taking on Trump means she's running with an eye toward becoming Trump's vice presidential running mate or hoping to position herself as a leading candidate for 2028, there's a path for her to win the nomination this year simply because Trump's own way forward is filled with potholes and traps.If Trump is disqualified, somehow unable to run or perhaps convicted and made too toxic even for his supporters, the space could clear for the GOP's second-place finisher to step in and become the nominee. Call it the banana peel path.The odds now strongly favor Trump's nomination. But even ifHaleyand most of the rest of thecurrent Republican establishmentfind the disturbing facts of Trump's past, present and futuretoo riskyto mention, they loom large over the country - andthe world's- political and security horizon.The inescapable reality is that Trump is in very deep legal trouble, and for very good reasons. His legal cases areextremely seriousand his strategy oftrying to delayall cases until after the election could fail.Trump is also, as Haley has noted, an old man. He will be78 on Election Day, andhis lifestyleis not one that promotes longevity. He isobese, hasn't always exercised as his doctors have recommended and already has a common form ofheart disease. He also lives with stress most of us could hardly imagine, considering his legal woes, another factor that experts say isharmfulto one's health.Trump's supporters may not care that he haspraised brutal dictators, that he faces multiple accusations ofsexual assault, that he tried tooverturn a legitimate election, or even that he suggested hewould ignore US commitmentsto its allies under NATO.The wheels of justice are grinding on, though. Most cases areunlikely to be resolvedbefore the election, and it'suntested legal waterswhether a convicted - or imprisoned - criminal can assume the presidency. Trump's claim ofabsolute immunity,now before an appeals court, will go a long way in determining the timing of some of the processes.But Trump has been charged with91 criminal counts. He faces a volcano of legal troubles, with a potential sentence ofdecades in prisonif convicted. He is being tried on charges ofracketeering, of trying tooverturn election results, of threatening national security by illegally taking to his country club home super-secretnational defense documents- including on nuclear programs and USvulnerabilities to military attacks- and showing them to people without security clearances.Courts have already ruled that hecommitted fraud in his businessand that he committed sexual battery.Even if Republican candidates, with few exceptions, seem oblivious to these extraordinary allegations of misconduct, the alarms sounded by those who worked with him during the Trump presidency are nearly deafening.It's another way in which this race is unlike any other. At least 17 Cabinet-levelofficials of the Trump administrationarespeaking out against him. The risk he poses is so great, they say, that some vow tocampaign for Bidenif Trump is the nominee.This election is so far from normal, John Prideaux of The Economist concluded our vocabulary simply falls short: \"words like 'uncharted' and 'unprecedented'\" won't do. \"America will need new [words] for this election.\"But it's not just a one-of-a-kind election because of Trump. It is also because of Haley, who despite facing what may be the most flawed, and certainly the most legally embattled, rival in the history of US democracy, said she would vote for Trumpeven if he's convicted, andwould pardonhim if she's elected.She can only hope the road ahead includes something (legally) slippery that takes Trump out of the race.Opinion by Frida GhitisTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
