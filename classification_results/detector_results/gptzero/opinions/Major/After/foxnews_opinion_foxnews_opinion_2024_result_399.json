And if he does, how does that affect the far-left antisemitic voters,particularly in Michigan, who have swung dramatically toward Hamas in recent years?Biden’s unpopular open border policies are costing him support from blue-collar and urban voters, who traditionally vote for Democrats, but now fear for their own safety.  If he overcorrects to placate those voters, he risks offending his NGO and nonprofit allies who favor unfettered migration. Those are the folks who canvas for his party, raise money for his candidates, and organize protests.That leaves him with gaslighting as his best option on immigration and crime.  Which is what his administration usually does – telling us the borders are secure and the streets are safe, and not to trust our own lying eyes.  But if he makes these claims in a debate, he risks appearing disconnected if not dishonest.  No one is fooled.TRUMP OFFERS TO TAKE DRUG SCREENING IF BIDEN AGREES TO SAME TESTAnd then there is the economy.  It’s consistently the top issue for voters.  Trump has the advantage of having presided over a more prosperous time for persuadable voting blocs. Echoing the current messaging from the left -- that voters are just too dumb to realize how good his economy really is – isn’t likely to make voters feel a connection. Not to mention how it might reflect on any claims of his competence, honesty, or mental acuity.Democrats have taken for granted that their traditional voters are solid. They’ve built their entire election infrastructure around the idea that minority voters, blue collar workers, young voters, immigrants, convicted felons, Jews, and suburban women will be solidly in their corner. But are they?CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONPolls show support among those voters is eroding for Biden.  Asking working-class voters to pay off the loans of Ivy League students hardly endears him to his blue-collar unions. His efforts to slow the Israeli response to Hamas have given many Jewish voters pause.  And his failure to mitigate the impact of his immigration policies on deep blue urban centers has begun to alienate inner city voters.Can Trump take advantage of growing divisions within the Biden base? Can Biden do likewise with the Republican base?Trump’s party, for its part, has its own fracturing base to contend with. Biden must try to exploit the advantages created by his party’s recent lawfare in the hopes that voters will recoil from electing someone who wears the label of \"convicted felon.\"  But in this, he too risks overplaying his hand and generating sympathy for the target of political lawfare.Joe Biden has much more to lose in this debate than Donald Trump.  If Trump can capitalize on the voter doubts about Biden’s capacity, his proficiency, and his suitability for the job, Democrats will be the ones to panic.Biden can afford a gaffe or two. Gaffes are so much a part of his persona that it might be more suspicious if he doesn’t make one. But it will undoubtedly be tough for him to go 90 minutes without notes or a teleprompter. God bless the person who has to write up the transcript of Biden's words.Ultimately, elections are about the future.  The candidate who can assuage voter fears about the future could take a commanding lead.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JASON CHAFFETZJason Chaffetz is a FOX News (FNC) contributor and the host of theJason In The Housepodcast on FOX News Radio.
