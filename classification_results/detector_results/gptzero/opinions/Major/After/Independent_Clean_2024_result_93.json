This is exactly what should happen in this case and Israel should, must and will investigate thoroughly.I do not believe it should be the fulcrum on which judgment of Israel’s response should depend – as if this was Israel’s modus operandi.In this unwanted, vicious war, it should not be used as a cudgel to deny Israel its right to the security of its borders or the safe return of its citizens. The tragedy for Israel and Gazans is that this will only be achieved once Hamas has been destroyed.The Independent’scry of “Enough” should, and must, be directed only in one direction. The injustice and tragedy of the situation must surely rest with Hamas, an unapologetic terror organisation that is bent on the destruction of Israel and the massacre of Jews.But the coordinates for that seem to have been lost in the fog of war.AnonymousRishi’s desperate roll of the diceSome people will not have noticedRishi Sunak’s latest threats to theEuropean Court of Human Rights, due to the appalling news from Gaza. Others will dismiss the prime minister’s threats toleave the human rights courtwe helped create in the late 1950s as the same old empty rhetoric.However, we must take note as this could be Sunak’s first step on the path which ends with a desperate roll of the dice. His words could become more bellicose week on week, as heavy defeats loom in the local and mayoral elections. He may well offer the chance of a referendum on our membership if he is re-elected.Rishi Sunak may not be able to rally parliament to such self-harm, but he probably thinks this will remove any chance of him being ousted, and could potentially neutralise the threat from Reform UK. Such actions will not save him, nor his party; it will not lead to our departure from the ECHR, but it will embolden parties on the right who can never be assuaged. Further chaos will only follow for years to come; just take a look at what happened whenDavid Cameron did likewisein 2015.Robert BostonKentA lesson in historyI believe the prime minister should forget about his idea of18-year-olds learning mathsand take a course in modern history himself.Those of us who were born during the Second World War know that the European Court of Human Rights was implemented by Winston Churchill and other European leaders, to ensure the human rights of peoplewere not abused againafter the proliferation of those abuses carried out throughout Europe by the Nazis.By removing human rights from desperate people, already fleeing from countries where they have no protections, we would be joining the likes of Russia and the Taliban.Sunak’s threat of leaving the ECHR just to enable hisRwandaplan to work is the best argument for stopping the current bill from becoming law.Bob SampsonWest SussexWill our prime minister ever learn?To put the United Kingdom’s commitment to human rights in doubt all over an obsession with the Rwanda bill is mind-boggling.Time is not on our side toleave the European Courtof Human Rights at all. All it does is give our country, a once-respected liberal nation, a bad name. And all to keep the fringes of Sunak’s own party happy.Instead ofmistreating refugeesto placate the Conservatives’ right-wing, why not be more welcoming and offer them training and support to help establish their new life in this country?When will our prime minister ever learn that it is the human trafficking gangs that should be targeted; it is them risking so many innocent lives for the love of money?Geoffrey BrookingHavant"
