That is when the real work of the jury begins: asking each other questions, learning from each other, sending notes out to the judge when they have a legal question or one about exactly what was said in testimony.That push and pull as all 12 try to reach consensus is the essence of the jury process, and juries take it very seriously. I say that having tried cases before juries and having interviewed the jurors after their deliberations as well as having served on a couple of juries myself.In my over 30 years of legal experience, and from sitting in this courtroom during weeks of testimony, I have never seen a morewell-educated, attentive and determined jury than this one. I am confident they will lead each other on a meticulous exploration of the evidence and consider carefully how to apply the law to it.We got proof of that at 2:56 p.m. when the jury sent afour-part noteto the judge requesting information about a series of communications involving former National Enquirer publisherDavid Pecker, including his direct communications with Trump, about aspects of the alleged\"catch and kill\"conspiracy (to pay for and suppress negative stories about Trump) to benefit his campaign. While reading jury notes as if they were tea leaves can be treacherous, the note feels to me like an ominous sign for the former president.Defense counsel Todd Blanche, in hisclosing argumentTuesday, urged the jury to take multiple off-ramps before they ever got to the alleged conspiracy, such as finding that there was no proof of false documents or that Trump wasn't involved increating them; instead, given their desire to revisit Pecker's testimony, the jury seems to have sped past that to the alleged underlying election conspiracy.Moreover, rather than disregarding thetestimonyof former Trump attorney Michael Cohen (and, with him, the case), as Blanche also urged, they are focusing on an independent witness who corroborates him. That is a point the jury seemed to highlight by asking as well for the testimony of both Pecker and Cohen about a key meeting, as if they are seeking thecorroboration that the prosecution emphasized. And the actual content of the incidents covered in the note to Merchan - theAugust 2015 Trump Tower meetingat which the election conspiracy was allegedly formed; thehush money paid to former Playboy model Karen McDougal(who also alleged she had an affair with Trump) to allegedly implement the conspiracy; and Peckerultimately backing awayfrom seeking reimbursement for the McDougal payment - all tend to incriminate Trump, as prior trial diaries havedetailed.As we were in court waiting for the requests in the first note to be addressed, the buzzer rang again - indicating that the jury hadanother request. This time it was for the judge to re-read thejury instructionsto them, another indicator of the care they are taking in deliberations.We will see how long their deliberations take, but this afternoon's developments suggest that it will not be an instant process. Nor should it be, not for any defendant - but particularly not for this one.Opinion by Norman EisenTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
