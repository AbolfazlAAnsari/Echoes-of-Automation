Every social problem - fromracismtoauthoritarianism,mental healthtoeconomic inequality- will get far worse.We have a moral imperative to mitigate the climate crisis in any way we possibly can. Yes, that includes giant vacuum cleaners - or, as I playfullycalledthem in 1998 (quoting \"Bloom County\"), giant laser space frisbees. Even if that means the bad guys sometimes win. Indeed, especially if bad guys sometimes win.In an ideal world, we would cut emissions enough to mitigate the climate crisis. But in the real world, we've failed to do so for 30 years, and time has run out. We need every tool in the climate toolbox.Martin Bunzl, a professor of philosophy emeritus at Rutgers University, has been writing about the ethics of climate policy for decades. On a recent 90-degree day in New Jersey, he told me that in the context of political choice, the \"moral hazard\" argument often has it backward.\"Studies have shown that it's cheaper to clean litter off of highways than try to persuade people not to litter in the first place,\" he said. It seems ridiculous, and it lets litterbugs off the hook, but cleanup is the better policy than anti-litter campaigns - or at the very least, a necessary accompaniment to them - if the goal is to have clean roads.Likewise, investing in direct air capture can be read as granting carte blanche to fossil fuel companies. It doesn't solve any of the other problems associated with overconsumption and pollution. And it is the opposite of the kind of virtue signaling in which liberals love to indulge with our reusable coffee mugs and electric cars. (I have both.)But those virtue signals are often environmentally worthless - remember, it was \"Big Oil\" thatpopularizedthe term \"carbon footprint\" in the first place. And when it comes to leaving my daughter a world that is inhabitable and recognizable, I'll choose what works.No, CDR doesn't punish the bad guys or lead us to a kinder, greener world. But it might help save the planet.Opinion by Jay MichaelsonTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
