Period.\"Biden has shaken the traditional foreign policy alignment the U.S. has traditionally enjoyed with Britain.Biden's approach, which would be problematic even if directed at a country of minimal consequence to the U.S., becomes even more concerning when applied to Britain – a country of significant importance.Perhaps even more damaging, Biden's unilateral decision regarding thewithdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, straining trust and undermining the very essence of the special relationship, provoked unprecedented British criticism of a U.S. president. British MPs were actually moved to hold him in contempt, for\"throwing us and everybody else to the fire\" by pulling out U.S. troops, prompting them to label him \"dishonorable\" for criticizing Afghan forces for not having the will to fight.Intelligence sharing and security cooperation, cornerstones of the transatlantic alliance, particularly in thefight against terrorism, have met with hurdles under Biden's tenure. The absence of coordination in the Afghanistan catastrophe disrupted the intricate web of intelligence sharing and counterterrorism efforts.Then there are the symbolic gestures. From giving back the bust of Churchill that President Donald Trump had restored to the Oval Office to skipping King Charles’ historic coronation, Biden has shown that, like his former boss,Barack Obama, at best, our mother country and faithful fighting partner means no more to him than any of the member states of the global community. Or worse – as Obama once threatened – as \"back of the queue.\"Biden has shaken the foreign policy alignment the U.S. has traditionally enjoyed with Britain. Contrasting approaches and unilateral decisions have sown discord with our trusted fighting and trade partner.Nevertheless, the relationship must survive. The economic (bilateral investment is estimated to exceed £1 trillion) and intelligence synergies are too important to falter. However, the stakes are high and the perils are many.It is essential that we preserve the U.S.-U.K. relationship. It is imperative to maintain our alliance to leverage the combined assets of shared intelligence, military capabilities and diplomatic influence to counter the challenges posed by China and Russia and preserve the stability and security of the international order.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LEE COHENLee Cohen, a senior fellow of the Bow Group and the Bruges Group, was adviser on Great Britain to the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee and founded the Congressional United Kingdom Caucus.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
