It's also true for those in El Paso, whether they're small business owners who benefit from customers from Juarez or those seeking more affordable medical services in Mexico.And when we have a broken immigration system, our community is at the front doorstep of those seeking a better or safer life from the south -- an Ellis Island of the Southwest. Our response to immigration as a community in El Paso, one built on a foundation of compassion and responsibility, shows a different vision of what the border is and can be.What Comer -- and others -- should know is that El Paso and Juarezmake upone of the largest binational communities in the world. With roughly 1.5 million people in Juarez andclose to 900,000in El Paso County, this cherished relationship informs so much of what it means to be from our city, where$82 billion worth of tradepassed through our ports of entry in 2018, the most recent data available from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts.Yes, some might think we're in the middle of nowhere. But we're at the center of North America, the crossroads of modern and ancient highways and trade routes. About17% of all tradebetween the United States and Mexico occurs in this region, day after day.Rich and poor cross both ways as does food, family, students, music, culture and business. We are named \"El Paso Del Norte\" (\"the Pass of the North\"), and our proximity to the border has always informed our culture and economy -- past, present and future.Opportunities, both economic and cultural, are something that our city council has prioritized. Economically, we have focused on opportunities for increased trade by supporting apublic-private program, which uses city tax dollars to pay Customs and Border Patrol agents overtimeto keep more lanesopen during peak times on our bridges and ports of entry. Tens of thousands of pedestrianscross over our bridgeseach month, and our shops and stores are filled with people spending their dollars. This is true today and has been the case for decades.Culturally, we understand and celebrate our unique binational identity. In 2018, El Paso re-started anelectric streetcar servicein uptown and downtown El Paso. Utilizing the same art-deco designed streetcars that used to travel between both cities until 1974, it brought back memories for many families on both sides of the border whilehelping to usherhundreds of millions of dollars of private sector investment, including several new hotels in downtown El Paso since the streetcar opened.Our community is also a blessing when it comes to opportunity and education. Of the 24,000 students at the University of Texas El Paso, 84% are Hispanic and 48% of all graduatesare first generation college students. Many of them are Mexican nationals whocross the borderhours before sunrise to go to school. UT-El Paso is one of the leading Hispanic-serving universities in the United States, and itcurrently hasthe only bilingual creative writing MFA program in the world.I hope the House Oversight Committee knows thatover $725 billion dollarsof trade flows between the United States and Mexico. I hope they know that El Paso has one of the highest populations of immigrants and first generation Americans in the US and yet we are consistently rankedone of the safest big citiesin the United States.In El Paso, we have had to learn to make things work, build ourselves up and celebrate ourselves. The desert builds familiarity, compassion and heart; we're one family, regardless of what side of the border we're from.What El Paso and Juarez can do more than any other place in this world is show how we can live together. We have seen that through the success of the international streetcar line, through the ways our students, families, businesses and culture mix and interact every day. That is our destiny, our birthright and opportunity not just today, but every day moving forward, generation after generation. This is something few understand unless you have had the fortune of living here.Opinion by Peter SvarzbeinTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
