His speech, delivered in Arabic, thus had been widely anticipated.Though Nasrallah praised as \"heroes\" thePalestinian terroristswho entered Israel to slaughter Jews, Hamas must have been deeply disappointed by his speech. While Hezbollah has been targeting Israeli positions in Northern Israel with anti-tank rockets and missiles and engaging in skirmishes along the border in which it claims 50 of its fighters have died, Hamas has been begging Hezbollah and Iran to do more. But if Hamas was expecting more from its ideologically aligned ally, it was surely chagrined by Nasrallahâ€™s assertion that its limited attacks on Northern Israel were sufficient for now.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\"What is happening on the border may appear moderate,\" Nasrallah said, \"but that is not the case.\" The operations, he said, \"have led to a state of fear and panic\" among the [Israeli] and American leaderships.\"FILE â€“ Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, the head of the Lebanese Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah, gives a speech to mark the anniversary of assassination by Israel of its secretary general Sheikh Abbas Musawi, February 16, 2006 in Beirut.

Nasrallah denied that the enormous firepower near his border was responsible for Iranâ€™s apparent decision not to open a second front in the war right now. \"Your warships in the Eastern Mediterranean do not scare us and never scared us before,\" he said.If Hamas was distressed by Hezbollahâ€™s apparent reluctance to offer greater military aid, it must also have been disappointed by Washingtonâ€™s continuing support for Israelâ€™s right to bomb Hamas strongholds despite soaring Palestinian civilian deaths and a looming humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.Nasrallahâ€™s speech coincided with another visit byU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinkento Israel. At a press conference held while Nasrallah was speaking, Blinken restated Americaâ€™s support for Israel and warned Hezbollah and Iran yet again not to open another front in the conflict. \"Weâ€™re committed to deterring aggression from any part,\" he said, \"weâ€™ll take the steps necessary to deal with it.\"While Blinken said that \"we need to do more to protect Palestinian civilians,\" he continued to back Israelâ€™s \"right,\" indeed, its \"obligation\" to defend itself. Appearing visibly shaken by the graphic video and photographs he was shown of the October 7 attack,Blinken saidthat Hamasâ€™s atrocities remained \"almost beyond the human capacity to process, to digest.\" He also criticized those protesting in support of Hamas, though not by name.
