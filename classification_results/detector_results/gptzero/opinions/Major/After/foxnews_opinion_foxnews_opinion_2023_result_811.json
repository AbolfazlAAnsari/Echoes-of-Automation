His speech, delivered in Arabic, thus had been widely anticipated.Though Nasrallah praised as \"heroes\" thePalestinian terroristswho entered Israel to slaughter Jews, Hamas must have been deeply disappointed by his speech. While Hezbollah has been targeting Israeli positions in Northern Israel with anti-tank rockets and missiles and engaging in skirmishes along the border in which it claims 50 of its fighters have died, Hamas has been begging Hezbollah and Iran to do more. But if Hamas was expecting more from its ideologically aligned ally, it was surely chagrined by Nasrallah’s assertion that its limited attacks on Northern Israel were sufficient for now.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\"What is happening on the border may appear moderate,\" Nasrallah said, \"but that is not the case.\" The operations, he said, \"have led to a state of fear and panic\" among the [Israeli] and American leaderships.\"FILE – Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, the head of the Lebanese Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah, gives a speech to mark the anniversary of assassination by Israel of its secretary general Sheikh Abbas Musawi, February 16, 2006 in Beirut.
