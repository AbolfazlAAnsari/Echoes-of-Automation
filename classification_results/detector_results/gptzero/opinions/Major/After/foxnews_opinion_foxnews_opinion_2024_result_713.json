When the protestors chant, \"Al-Qassam you make us proud, kill another soldier now,\" they are not \"peaceful\" as New York Democrat Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezwould have you believe.  In fact, they are no better than the terrorists they are supporting through their activities.If these protesters are really interested in a free Palestinian people, they would call for Hamas to release the Palestinians from their thumb of oppression where Palestinians are used as pawns in Hamas’ conflict with Israel. Or they should at least call for Hamas to surrender and release all the hostages taken on October 7th, which would end Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza.In the Trump administration, I worked withPresident Trumpto lead the effort to root out antisemitism around the globe.  We worked to label any entity that worked to undermine Israel and spread antisemitic hate to call out and end such behavior.PARENTS WARN OF 'NIGHTMARE' CLIMATE ON COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS: JEWISH STUDENTS 'ARE BEING THREATENED'The Biden administration should do the same. This isn’t a Republican or Democrat issue; it’s what is right. And more significantly, our actions here in America are another symbol of American leadership or weakness on perhaps the most critical human rights issue in the last century. President Truman recognized its significance for American leadership in combating antisemitism by being the first world leader to recognize theState of Israelin 1948.  President Biden should show that same leadership to the world that antisemitism will not be tolerated here or around the globe.Israel isour closest allyin the Middle East. They are the only democracy in the Middle East. And they have been seeking peace with many of their Arab neighbors.  In fact, in the Trump administration, we helped lead that effort through the historic Abraham Accords. And there is more work that can be done, but acts of terrorism by Iran or its proxies and antisemitic acts here at home only act to derail those efforts in seeking the destruction of Israel and the Jews.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThat is why swift and strong action against the protesters is necessary. If college campuses or the police won't take action to protect Jewish students, then the federal government should absolutely step in.President Biden’s\"both sides\" statementisn’t enough. It instead sends the wrong message that antisemitism will be tolerated as long as protestors are advocating for the freedom of the Palestinians. Tolerating faith-based harassment and violence on campuses is both evil and illegal.Some universities like Columbiaare giving in to the protesters by moving their classes online for the rest of the semester. How unfair to all of their students and to the parents who paid a high premium for an Ivy League education only to have it delivered in a cowardly way on a computer.  Parents should demand a refund.  Instead, these colleges should act to protect their Jewish students and the integrity of their pedagogy.  They should immediately revoke the visas of and deport all foreign students studying in the USA who support Hamas. And they should expel American students arrested in the protests. And we should also revoke federal student loans for any American student arrested for supporting Hamas.Anti-Israel agitators construct an encampment on Columbia University’s campus in New York City on Monday, April 22, 2024.(Peter Gerber)Columbia University president Minouche Shafik  leaves the Low Memorial Library on the campus of Columbia University, Wednesday, April 24, 2024. The embattled president, who's under pressure to resign her post, reportedly met with Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Mike Johnson before his speech at the university earlier.(Fox News Digital)Anti-Israel agitators gather on Columbia University’s campus in New York City on Monday, April 22, 2024.(Peter Gerber)Anti-Israel agitators gather on Columbia University’s campus in New York City on Monday, April 22, 2024.  The university announced that all classes would be held virtually today in response to the ongoing demonstrations on campus.(Peter Gerber)The passenger that accosted Adams accused him of leaving the state while anti-Israel agitators were being arrested by police at Columbia University in recent days.(Peter Gerber)Supporters of these universities should vote with their pocketbooks and do as New England Patriots team ownerRobert Kraftdid and stop their financial support of institutions of higher education that refuse to protect Jewish students.  And the boards of these institutions should ask that their presidents resign.While free speech is a special right guaranteed to all Americans,antisemitic speechis not. All of us who value free speech, even in legitimate debate, should agree that once again allowing the seeds of Jewish hate to be planted anywhere will lead to the destruction of those freedoms that we cherish.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MICHAEL POMPEOMike Pompeo served in the Trump administration as the sixth director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the 70th U.S. secretary of state.
