There simply isn't enough money to pay everyone without raising the debt limit.The politics of debt prioritization won't pass the smell test either when creditors in China and other nations are paid but, say, Border Patrol agents or air traffic controllers are not. Danger, danger. In 2015, I wasone of fewer than 10 House Republicanswho voted against such a shambolic prioritization proposal that does not seriously address the underlying problem of balancing or better aligning current federal spending with existing revenues.Expectations of a negotiated settlement over the debt ceiling along the lines proposed by House Republicans seem remote. Consequently, the burden will fall upon pragmatic House Republicanssuch as Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick and Don Bacon to find a bipartisan solution.A reboot of theSimpson-Bowles fiscal reform commissioncould be a way for Congress to address the deficit and long-term debt in a responsible manner without risking the full faith and credit of the United States.If, as expected, debt ceiling negotiations fail to yield an agreement by the drop-dead date established by Yellen, probably this summer, then some problem-solving House Republicans along with Democrats will likely deploya discharge petition to forcea clean debt ceiling bill out of committee and onto the House floor for a vote.As someone who was involved with thelast successful discharge petition in 2015 over the Export-Import Bank reauthorization, this procedural mechanism is complex and slow-moving.The debt ceiling has been raised repeatedly over recent decades. I fully expect it will be raised once again, but not until every other alternative is rejected. Let's hope it happens before any real damage is done to America's standing and the global economy.Opinion by Charlie DentTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
