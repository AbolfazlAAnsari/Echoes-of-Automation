HERE'S WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDSYet while the proximate causes differed, the modus operandi was the same: harangue and attack peaceful students before occupying buildings.I was on the receiving end of their vitriol. To mimic the business behavior of the time, my classmates and I wore coats and ties, which the protesters saw as the uniform of the capitalist oppressor class. They blockaded the business school, first spitting on us as we walked by, then throwing bricks and other heavy objects. Thankfully, I wasn’t injured, though several of my peers weren’t so lucky.The administration should have intervened from the start,clearing the offenders from campusimmediately. Instead, they acted timidly, abdicating their duty to provide an education.LEFT-WING UNIVERSITY LEADERS HELPED CREATE ANTI-ISRAEL CAMPUS CHAOS. WE DON'T' NEED TO BAIL THEM OUTMany students, me included, couldn’t continue learning since we couldn’t physically enter our classrooms and online courses didn’t exist. I sat around waiting for the university to reopen for days, then weeks, as the campus descended into worse chaos.Emboldened by the administration’s inaction, the protesters occupied five buildings,including Hamilton Hall, the site of the current insanity. They even took the acting dean hostage in his office. The correct response would have been to evict these squatters within hours. Instead, the occupiers enjoyed their newfound domain for a week straight.Students occupy Columbia University's Hamilton Hall on April 23, 1968, with a photo of Mao Tse Tung hanging above a doorway.

Campus leaders finally asked the police to restore order, which they promptly did. In the early hours of a Tuesday morning, they took back the buildings, arresting nearly 700 protesters, about 300 of whom were injured. Fifty-six years later, on a Wednesday morning, the police arrested more than 100 protesters, withreportsof violent scenes in the hallways of an Ivy League institution.SPOILED CHILDREN HAVE SEIZED THE COLLEGES WE PAY FORWhy did history rhyme? Because Columbia’s leaders sang from the same failed songbook.They valued pandering toa small number of radicalsover educating the larger majority of tuition-paying students. They drew red lines, then dithered when protesters crossed them.An anti-Israel demonstrator holds a flag on the rooftop of Hamilton Hall at Columbia University in New York on Tuesday, April 30, 2024.(Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Worst of all, they failed to prepare their own students with a proper understanding of both civic rights and duties – especially the duty to respect the rights of others, not least the fellow students and faculty who’ve suffered from the disruption of learning. Freedom of speech comes with a moral responsibility to listen when others talk.AS A HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADER, HERE'S OUR MESSAGE ON CHAOS, ANTISEMITISM FOR UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTSIn the wake of the ’68 protests, many alumni, parents and policymakers assumed it would never happen again. Clearly, we were wrong, and trust in Columbia has rightly plummeted to the verge of extinction.The school’s leadership– if not the president, then the board of trustees – must make a last-ditch attempt to reorient the school back to true education. As the latest protests make clear on campuses nationwide, students must be taught to disagree without being disagreeable, to argue vigorously but not violently.Acting at the request of Columbia University's Board of Trustees, police evict some 500 rebellious students who have occupied campus buildings for seven days in a protest against university policy on April 30, 1968.Now more than ever, higher education needs a culture of free speech and open discourse, not cancellation and indoctrination under the guise of diversity, equity, social justice or some other ideological cudgel.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONBut the greatest educational need at Columbia doesn’t involve the students at all.
