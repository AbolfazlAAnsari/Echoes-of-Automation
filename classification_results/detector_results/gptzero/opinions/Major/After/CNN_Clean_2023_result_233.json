For years, much of theresearchinto therising Black maternal mortality ratestreated Black women problematically - conflating income, education, and not getting prenatal care with high rates of preterm birth, low birthweight and maternal deaths.Now there ismore researchreflecting the underlying reality that regardless of educational attainment or related factors like income, Black women experience higher maternal mortality rates across the board. So why aren't more policy and advocacy efforts focused on providing pregnancy and postpartum services for Black women across the economic spectrum?The misconception and narrative that Black maternal mortality rates are tied to income has already caused harm. Black women professionals, scientists and medical doctors have shared with me their near-death misses in childbirth; several of them also shared that they too considered themselves not at a high risk. \"Many Black birthing folks reasoned 'If the so-called research said the problem is being poor and unable to advocate for yourself and I'm not poor and am educated enough to advocate for myself then I will be ok,' that's false and dangerous thinking,\" said Chanel Porchia-Albert, the founder and executive director of Ancient Song Doula Services, a Brooklyn-based organization that provides doula services to women of color and marginalized communities.In my travels advocating for Black and brown patient experience data as a critical tool for systemic change, I meet many middle-class Black women who are not Medicaid eligible but don't make enough to afford the costs of a doula or at-home postpartum support. Some ask friends and family to chip in and I encourage them to put it on their baby registry as something others can contribute to. But the idea of burdening other family and friends often does not sit well with them, and not every community member thinks of a doula as necessary when a crib, diapers and other essentials are also needed.To be clear, efforts that focus on the needs of the under-resourced are critical. More than 3.3 million Black women,or one in four nationally,are covered by Medicaid.  According to theNational Health Law Program's Doula Medicaid Project, 11 state Medicaid programs currently reimburse doulas to a modest degree, and nearly a dozen are in some phase of the process to do so. This is an overdue recognition of the value of doulas and critical momentum to make sure they are accessible and paid a living wage.But Medicaid coverage alone is insufficient to meaningfully address the nation's Black maternal mortality crisis. This approach is short-sighted and continues to promote a dangerous narrative that research and too much anecdotal evidence has already disproven. \"Medicaid covers the majority of births in our community and other payers often follow Medicaid's lead when it comes to improving payment and coverage so setting the tone within Medicaid makes sense, but it can't be the end goal,\" Dr. Nathan Chomilo, Medical Director for Minnesota's Medicaid & MinnesotaCare program, told me.To improve the support Black birthing people receive, more commercial health plans should commit to reimbursing doulas as well. In Massachusetts, both the state Medicaid program known as MassHealth and private health plans are compelled to pay doulas who have metspecifiedtraining and credentialing criteria.Employers also need to step up and are positioned to provide access more directly. \"Sixty five percent of people who get health insurance from their employer are in a self-funded plan - meaning those employers have a direct financial stake, in addition to the personnel/workforce stake, in keeping employees, including Black women healthy,\" Chomilo told me.The NBDA spearheaded a landmark partnership with Wal-Mart, one of the largest payers for pregnancy-related healthcare in the nation, to offerdoula servicesas an employee benefit.Policymakers are paying long overdue attention to reducing high rates of mortality and morbidity among Black women. But they must go further to fully address the maternal mortality disparities by addressing racism and bias in care beyond mandating training for healthcare providers without accountability, pushing for cultural and systemic change within medical schools and health systems, funding midwifery care models and birth centers for low-risk pregnancies, and ensuring there is policy advocacy and change across the economic spectrum for Black women.\"We are all at risk when we choose to see the issue of Black maternal health from one side,\" said Porchia-Albert.In practice, principle, research, advocacy and messaging, we must leave no Black woman behind.Opinion by Kimberly Seals AllersTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
