Harris publicly supported Jessica’s Law in 2006 as San Francisco DA, but then when it became politically expedient, she ordered parole officers to ignore its restrictions on where sex offenders could live.Beyond Harris’ elevation of her personal views above the law, she has taken delight in abusing her prosecutorial power. For example, as DA and AG she bragged about punishing parents with fines and jail time for truancy if their kids skipped school, along with collateral charges such as contributing to the delinquency of a minor and domestic violence.The most vulnerable parents, of course, were those who were low-income, minority and/or disabled whose children attended public schools. Harris bragged that \"as a prosecutor in law enforcement, I have a huge stick,\"in order to frighten these families, and sent homicide and gang prosecutors to schools to scare both administrators and parents.KAMALA HARRIS SUPPORTED ‘DEFUND THE POLICE’ IN 2020 RADIO INTERVIEW, BEFORE BIDEN CAMPAIGN SAID OTHERWISEIt didn’t work; according to the state Department of Education, overall truancy continued to rise.But perhaps Harris’s worst prosecutorial behavior was fighting to keep innocent people in jail and to uphold wrongful and overturned convictions that had been secured through unconstitutional official misconduct such as perjury, evidence tampering, and hiding potentially exculpatory evidence.For example, as DA, Harrisviolated the Constitutionwhen she did not disclose to defense attorneys crucial information about a police laboratory employee who stole drugs from the lab, intentionally sabotaged its work, spent time in an alcoholic rehabilitation center, and had been convicted of assault and domestic violence.Harris’ unconstitutional and unethical behavior was so egregious that more than 600 cases were dismissed and thousands more placed into question. The courts condemned her and her office for systemically violating defendants’ constitutional rights. Harris blamed the police and the judge for her choices.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONAs AG, Harris continued violating the Constitution and defendants’ civil rights. For example, she insisted on keepingan innocent man, Daniel Larsen,in prison for an additional two years after a federal court threw out his conviction and found him \"actually innocent.\" Even after Larsen was finally freed, Harris continued to appeal and challenge his release.Worse, she did her best to keep Efrain Velasco-Palacios in custody even though the court found that a local prosecutor had inserted a falsified confession into the transcript of a defendant’s statement. Harris argued that the court was wrong to describe it as \"outrageous government misconduct\" that \"shocked the conscience\" because the prosecutor’s evidence tampering didn’t involve \"abject physical brutality.\"In a similar case, Baca v. Adams, the 9th Circuit slammed Harris at oral argument for defending a wrongful conviction which prosecutors unconstitutionally obtained by putting on perjured testimony from a jailhouse informant and a prosecutor,both of whom lied under oath. The 9th Circuit scolded Harris and her office so badly that she was forced to dismiss the case.These examples barely scratch the surface of Harris’ failures as thetop prosecutor in San Franciscoand then California. She has also selectively investigated and prosecuted entities for her own political benefit, failed to protect her female staff from sexual harassment by her top male aide, and overseen thousands of marijuana-related convictions which disproportionately affected Black and Latino communities, all while bragging about her own marijuana use in high school and college.The more Harris invokes her prosecutorial record, the more she will raise doubts about her candidacy for the presidency.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JOHN YOOCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JOHN SHUJohn Shu is a legal scholar and commentator who served in the administrations of Presidents George H.W.
