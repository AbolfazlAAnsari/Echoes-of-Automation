Moreover, Marcus failed to mention that Singer was a Princeton physics Ph.D., that his co-authors have Ph.D.s in atmospheric physics and climatology and that their book includes two forwards by Princeton physicists, one a former president of the National Academy of Sciences. Concerning the link with dirty fossil fuel money, the Heartland Institute notes(https://heartland.org/opinion/heartland-institute-responds-to-fake-news-about-its-funding-in-slate-article/), \"When Exxon was a donor to Heartland, from 1998 to 2006, its contributions of about $50,000 never exceeded more than five percent of our annual budget.\"Needless to say, Peterson's views should not automatically be accepted because of the credentials of the authors he cited. On the other hand, they should not automatically be dismissed for the reasons the Independent invokes - even if they were true. Like any propositions about science or public policy, they should be discussed and debated openly and publicly and evaluated on their merits. Peterson makes no claim to being a climate scientist. But intelligent, well-informed lay persons who have clearly done their homework must not be discouraged from participating in open debate.These days, however, censorship extends not only to intelligent lay persons such as Peterson but also to views that have passed peer review and been published in prestigious academic journals. Two recent cases illustrate what some call(https://www.manhattancontrarian.com/blog/2023-8-27-free-speech-suppressed-everywhere-you-turn) the \"censorship industrial complex.\"In the first, a group of Italian scientists published(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357805134_A_critical_assessment_of_extreme_events_trends_in_times_of_global_warming) a paper in The European Physical Journal Plus that, relying on official data, assessed trends in extreme weather events. They concluded - correctly given the data but not politically correctly - that there are no noticeable trends in the frequency or severity of extreme weather events in recent years. The article initially passed peer review and was published in 2022. Then, a group of academics including Michael Mann of Climategate(https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2011/06/28/michael-mann-and-the-climategate-whitewash-part-one/?sh=4f4c1989449a) fame, complained to the editors, who retracted the article.The second case is a good example of the chilling effect of censorship. Patrick Brown, co-director of the climate and energy team at the Breakthrough Institute and an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University, published (with co-authors) a paper(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06444-3) in Nature on California's wildfires entitled \"Climate warming increases extreme daily wildfire growth risk in California.\" More important than the contents of the paper are what it left out, however. In an article in the Free Press, Bari Weiss' new media company, Brown wrote(https://www.thefp.com/p/i-overhyped-climate-change-to-get-published), \"I knew not to try to quantify key aspects other than climate change in my research because it would dilute the story that prestigious journals like Nature and its rival, Science, want to tell ... And the editors of these journals have made it abundantly clear, both by what they publish and what they reject, that they want climate papers that support certain pre-approved narratives - even when those narratives come at the expense of broader knowledge for society.\"Science advances when scientists express clear hypotheses and test them against the data. It requires open debate. It does not advance by consensus or political pressure; in fact, it is blocked by political pressure and appeals to consensus.Tories should embrace woke backlash(https://financialpost.com/opinion/tories-embrace-woke-backlash)NDP is always wrong: That's almost impressive(https://financialpost.com/opinion/ndp-always-wrong-almost-impressive)Ottawa's energy efficiency plan will raise new home costs 8%(https://financialpost.com/opinion/ottawa-energy-efficiency-raise-new-home-costs-8)Citizens are expected to vote concerning matters such as climate-change policies. They benefit from exposure to all sides of these issues. Those who would instead deny climate dissent need to recall a famous line from John Stuart Mill's On Liberty: \"He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.\"Financial PostSteve Ambler is professor emeritus of economics in the École des sciences de la gestion, Université du Québec à Montréal.Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the business news you need to know - add financialpost.com(https://financialpost.com/ ) to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here(https://financialpost.com/newsletters/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
