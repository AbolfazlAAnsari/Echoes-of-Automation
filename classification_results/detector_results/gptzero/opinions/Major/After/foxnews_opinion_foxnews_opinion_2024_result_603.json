TRUMP: MICHAEL COHEN'S LIES, LIES AND MORE LIES COULD SINK DA BRAGG'S CASEIt was foolhardy for Bragg and his team of partisans to hang their case on a notorious fabulist. But even if jurors believe some of Cohen’s testimony, there is still no credible evidence that business records were falsified as the indictment alleges. Reimbursements to Cohen for his ownStormy Daniels paymentswere booked as \"legal expenses\" because that is precisely what they were —a negotiated non-disclosure contract (NDA).More importantly, there is no plausible evidence that Trumpknewhow Cohen’s fees were booked. Why would he?Trump was not the accountant or controller. He was the CEO of a multi-billion dollar international company. He did not designate computer entries on non-public ledgers. That was an administrative function in a private business, not an executive responsibility by the corporate chairman.So where is the crime? Nowhere. Prosecutors have failed miserably to meet the standard of proof that the law requires.The indictment against Trump identifies the aforementioned payments as having occurred in 2017. How is it factually possible to falsify records in 2017 with the felonious intent to \"unlawfully\" influence an electionafterthe election occurred in 2016? It makes no sense, which is consistent with Bragg’s entire case.NY VS. TRUMP: MICHAEL COHEN'S LIES, LIES AND MORE LIES COULD SINK DA BRAGG'S CASEWhat exactly was unlawful? Campaigns are designed to influence elections. That’s their core purpose. No matter. Bragg criminalized non-criminal behavior by conjuring up an inapplicable (and expired) statute to persecute Trump under the guise of a prosecution.Yet, the D.A. seems utterly unbothered that he is butchering the law. Trump used his personal money, not campaign funds to compensate Cohen.  That’s perfectly lawful. The payments did not qualify as illegal contributions, which is why the Federal Election Commission (FEC) chose not to even levy a civil penalty. Likewise,the Justice Departmentfound no evidence of crimes.Neither the absence of facts nor the support of law deterred Bragg. He commandeered authority to enforce a federal campaign law over which he has no jurisdiction as a local prosecutor.  He usurped power to fulfill his campaign promise to put Trump behind bars and to damage a political enemy while benefiting his presidential opponent,Joe Biden.No fair or competent judge dedicated to upholding justice would have ever allowed such a train wreck of a trial to have desecrated the integrity of our legal system. But Judge Juan Merchan is the engineer who is driving this out-of-control locomotive.  He has all but jettisoned his black robe, stepped down from the bench, and take up residence at the prosecution’s table.The judge has mangled the rules of evidence that strictly prohibit irrelevant and prejudicial testimony. It is fundamentally unfair to smear a defendant with sordid stories that have little or nothing to do with the offenses charged. The nucleus of the prosecution’s case has been shameless character assassination.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONMerchan should have stopped this legal charade long ago.  His errant rulings have reversible error written all over them. But neither he nor his co-prosecutor, Bragg, give a damn. Their objective is to convict Trump to interfere in the upcoming presidential election.When Michael Cohen’s testimony ends and he eventually stumbles in shock off the witness stand after being bludgeoned by the defense, the prosecution will rest its case.  The question arises of what’s next?It may be tempting for Trump’s lawyers to callRobert Costelloto the stand.  In testimony before Congress Wednesday and in a lengthy interview on Fox News, Cohen’s former lawyer recounted in vivid detail how his client has been lying all along about Trump. It was Cohen’s idea to capitulate to Daniels’ blackmail scheme with an NDA. He handled it all. Trump had nothing to do with it.  Cohen understood that the then-candidate wanted to protect his family, not his campaign as the D.A. claims.Costello also disclosed an appalling episode when Bragg’s prosecutors concealed exculpatory evidence from the grand jury by concocting a phony hearsay excuse that does not even exist in such proceedings. That’s called obstruction of justice. It is a revealing window into acorrupt district attorneywho is determined to lacerate the law while suborning perjury to gain a wrongful conviction.Perhaps it is Alvin Bragg and his confederates who should be on trial, not Donald Trump.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GREGG JARRETTGregg Jarrett is a Fox News legal analyst and commentator, and formerly worked as a defense attorney and adjunct law professor.
