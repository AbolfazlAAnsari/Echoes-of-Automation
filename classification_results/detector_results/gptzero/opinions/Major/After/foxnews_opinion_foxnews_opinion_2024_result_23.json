TikTok officials told officials in Israel that it had already expunged 160 million fake TikTok accounts spreading disinformation online since the Israel-Hamas war broke out last October. But more needs to be done, including providing more robust antisemitism training to moderators who can help stem the spread of hateful content online.That’s because digital hate doesn’t stay online. It has real-life consequences, and is why so many young people march in the streets spouting hateful slogans that overtly or covertly call for the destruction of the Jewish people.Over 100 Congressional staffers walk out for a ceasefire in Gaza, which would leave terrorist Hamas still in power and holding more than 100 hostages.(FOX News)The concerning development here is that when pushed just a little bit on their motivations for spreading hateful content, whether intentional or not, many young people don’t know what they’re chanting about – or much about the Middle East.An insoluble conflict that has caused so much devastation and deadlock for decades cannot be distilled fully into a 15-second TikTok – and it shouldn't have to be. If younger generations want to engage in these very complex and tough topics, they need to be willing to take the time to read up on the subject, entertain multiple perspectives and not stay confined in their snug echo chambers perpetuated by TikTok's hypnotic algorithm.An illuminating study written about in the Wall Street Journal late last year found that the vast majority of college-age students who were taking part in anti-Israel protests didn't even know which river and which sea they were referring to when chanting, \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.\"CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONDov Forman runs a massively popular TikTok account with his 100-year-old great-grandmother, Lily Elbert, who survived the Holocaust. Forman uses the account to share lessons from the Holocaust while issuing warnings of rising antisemitism to their 2.1 million followers.My initial findings on TikTok were staggering. After scrolling briefly through make-up tutorials, synchronized dances and adorable dog videos, I stumbled across a video of a pro-Palestinian roaming kosher supermarkets in the U.S. and stopping visibly Jewish employees and customers to force them to say \"Free Palestine.\"But the account has been subjected to vile antisemitic abuse, receiving around 1,000 antisemitic messages every day since the Hamas terror attacks of October 7.\"The intensity and frequency of antisemitic content, ranging from Holocaust denial and distortion to overt expressions of racism and extremist sympathies, have alarmingly increased in recent months,\" Forman told me. \"These digital arenas have become breeding grounds for radicalization, often influenced by external bodies, including investment from Iran and China, aiming to exploit the impressionable minds of young children.\"Platforms like TikTok, Forman added, should prioritize user safety over profit, and in order to keep Jewish creators safe, more can be done to implement stringent platform policies, robust educational initiatives, and a collective societal commitment to uphold the dignity and respect of all individuals.Suffice it to say that after writing this piece, I deleted TikTok from my phone.Jonathan Harounoff is a journalist and alumnus of the Universities of Cambridge, Harvard and Columbia."
