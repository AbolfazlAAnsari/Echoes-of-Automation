Green paint.  Bright yellow-green, the color of things coming up new in the spring.\"And so in 1946, one year removed from her own incarceration in a camp like this, Corrie opened the Darmstadt facility to mirror what the Bloemendaal home had become in Holland.  With the extra space, though, Darmstadt could house one hundred sixty residents.  Soon the facility reached capacity and had a waiting list.  The German Lutheran Church agreed to help with administration, and another group, the Lutheran Sisterhood of Mary, assisted with women and children residents.  Corrie continued to speak to raise money for Darmstadt, and soon pastors and members of various churches began building homes around it.  Corrie now had three havens of healing.The ten Boom Children before the war…Corrie is seated on the left.In early 1947 Corrie spoke at a church in Munich, the town where Adolf Hitler had begun his political career with the ill-fated \"Beer Hall Putsch.\"  When she finished, a man worked his way through the crowd to speak with her.  Balding and heavyset, he wore an overcoat and carried a brown felt hat.  As he stepped closer, though, Corrie instead saw a blue uniform, cap with skull and crossbones, and a swinging leather crop.Her stomach churned.  It was him all right⸻the first SS guard she had seen in the Ravensbrück shower room. The undressing and nakedness, the pile of clothes, the leering and mocking men, Betsie’s ashen face.  Of all the sadistic camp guards, he was one of the most cruel.\"How grateful I am for your message,Fraulein,\" the man said.  \"To think that, as you say, He has washed my sins away!\"He held out his hand but Corrie didn’t reciprocate.  How could she touch this vermin?\"You mentioned Ravensbrück in your talk,\" he continued. \"I was a guard there.  But since that time I have become a Christian.  I know that God has forgiven me for the cruel things I did there, but I would like to hear it from your lips as well.\"He extended his hand again.  \"Fraulein, will you forgive me?\"Corrie wrestled with her bitterness.  This man represented the worst of the place that had taken Betsie’s life.  Forgiveness seemed impossible.WEST VIRGINIA BILL WOULD REQUIRE HOLOCAUST EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLSAt the same time, though, she remembered Jesus’s admonition: \"If you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your trespasses.\"  She had preached the importance of forgiveness the last twelve months, and she had seen first-hand at Bloemendaal and Darmstadt the practical impact: those who were able to forgive their former enemies resumed their lives, while those who could not remained emotional invalids.Corrie tried to smile, but she felt not the slightest spark of warmth or charity.  Quickly, she said a silent prayer: \"Jesus, help me! I can lift my hand.  I can do that much.  You supply the feeling.\"Mechanically, she lifted her arm.  As she gripped the man’s hand, something remarkable happened:  a current of energy passed between them, and a healing warmth flooded her body.  More than forgiveness, Corrie suddenly felt a genuine love for this man.Her eyes filled with tears.  \"I forgive you, brother!  With all my heart.\"For several moments she held his hand.  \"I had never known God’s love so intensely as I did then,\" she later remembered.This lesson she would not soon forget: one often cannot forgive without the power and grace of God.Larry Loftis is the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today and international bestselling author of the nonfiction spy thrillers \"THE PRINCESS SPY: The True Story of World War II Spy Aline Griffith, Countess of Romanones\"; \"CODE NAME: LISE: The True Story of the Woman Who Became WWII's Most Highly Decorated Spy\"; and \"INTO THE LION'S MOUTH: The True Story of Dusko Popov—World War II Spy, Patriot, and the Real-Life Inspiration for James Bond.\"  His fourth book,\"THE WATCHMAKER’S DAUGHTER: The True Story of World War II Heroine Corrie ten Boom,\"will be released by HarperCollins on March 7, 2023."
