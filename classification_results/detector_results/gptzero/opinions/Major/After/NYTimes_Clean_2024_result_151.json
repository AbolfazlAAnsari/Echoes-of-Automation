The Well-Off Must Accept Smaller Checks,” by Peter Coy (Opinion, nytimes.com, May 13):I find it maddening that the only solution to the Social Security Trust Fund difficulties offered by conservatives is reducing benefits.There are a number of acceptable increases that could solve the funding problems of Social Security and Medicare. By acceptable, I mean increases in the amount paid into the funds by wealthy individuals with high incomes, and no increases in the amount paid in by working stiffs.Let me suggest a few: The Social Security tax stops at a relatively low income level, $168,600 annually, this year. Why not do as Medicare already does and tax all of a person’s earned income?Speaking of all of a person’s income, why is it that only “earned” income is taxed for Social Security? Why not tax all income, including investment income? The really rich earn most of their income by investments, not salaries. To be fair, that income should be taxed, too.Another possibility is to make the payments progressive instead of a flat tax. Rich people can and should pay a higher S.S.A. tax, as they do on regular income.All of those measures would make Social Security and Medicare self-sufficient, and are additional expenses only to the well-off.Peter LimonIrasburg, Vt.To the Editor:Peter Coy outlines a thoughtful approach for fixing Social Security finances and making the program work better for American retirees. While the system is complex, the basic formula for restoring fiscal balance is simple.Benefit payments need to fall or program revenues — from payroll taxes or general appropriations — need to rise. The trick is getting Congress to act when supporting either policy is consideredpolitical malpractice.To break the stalemate and avoid the severe consequences of inaction, Congress should study how state governments dealt with underfunded public employee pensions following the 2008 financial crisis. Lawmakers across the political spectrum responded by increasingworker contributions,reducing cost of living adjustmentsfor retirees and allocatingadditional tax dollarsto help stabilize the systems.In isolation, any one of these policies could be criticized for political gain, but they were frequently approved as a package with bipartisan support and in states governed by Republicans and Democrats alike.Thelesson for Congressis that this approach — which prioritizes shared sacrifice across the population and shared political risk among lawmakers — provides a road map for finally fixing Social Security.Chris McIsaacWashingtonThe writer is a fellow with the governance program at the R Street Institute, a think tank.To the Editor:Peter Coy’s call for “transforming” Social Security “into a safety net for the least advantaged” misunderstands the purpose of the system. It is wage insurance, intended to allow people to maintain their standards of living by replacing earnings that are lost due to retirement, disability or death of a family breadwinner. Nearly all workers pay in, and nearly all benefit.The vast majority of Social Security beneficiaries arenot wealthy. To achieve significant savings by reducing benefits for higher earners you would need to define that as people with average lifetime earnings of only $85,000 per year. Congressional Republicans areproposingto do just that. In many areas of the country, that is barely middle class.Instead of slashing Social Security benefits for the middle class and turning it into a poverty level subsistence program, we should require the truly wealthy — those making over $400,000 a year — to contribute their fair share.President Bidenandcongressional Democratshave plans to do just that. Their proposals bring in enough revenue to not only ensure the benefits can be paid in full and on time for the foreseeable future, but also expand benefits.Nancy AltmanBethesda, Md.The writer is president of Social Security Works.Singapore’s ViewTo the Editor:“Singapore’s Riches Grew Under Its Longtime Leader, but So Did Discontent” (news article, May 16) claims that Singapore is “one of the most expensive cities in the world.” But the index you cited (published by The Economist) measures thecost of livingin Singapore primarily with expatriates and business travelers in mind, not citizens.Like many countries, Singapore has experienced higher inflation in recent years. But we heavily subsidize the basics of housing, health care and education for citizens.More than 80 percent of Singaporeans live in public housing, and the vast majority own their homes. Nine in 10 patients pay less than $370 out of pocket for a subsidized public hospital stay. Ninety percent of public education costs is subsidized.The Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, has improved in the last two decades, and redistributive policies have reduced income inequality further.Lui Tuck YewWashingtonThe writer is Singapore’s ambassador to the United States.An Ithaca Man’s Tragic DeathTo the Editor:“When Tommy Rath Vanished From Ithaca’s Squalid ‘Jungle’,” by Dan Barry (front page, May 19), paints a vivid picture of the tragic final years and death of an Ithaca resident, Thomas Rath. Our hearts ache for Mr. Rath’s family and the child he leaves behind.However, I object to Mr. Barry’s characterization of my administration’s efforts to solve the entwined problems of homelessness and crime while I was mayor of Ithaca.Crime in the city overall fell during my administration, as we worked tirelessly to create housing for Ithaca’s vulnerable residents. We built more affordable housing during our administrationthan in the 40 prior years of city history combined, as well as transitional shelters for residents of the Jungle homeless encampment.Far from discouraging police from patrolling the Jungle, we ordered patrols, and when officers refused to get out of their patrol cars in the area, we built a new road to facilitate access.The article unfortunately reinforces the false and oversimplified narrative that progressive administrations cannot reduce homelessness or crime, when in fact our administration achieved both those objectives.Sadly, pushing such narratives can lead to inhumane “solutions” that create greater harm, both for the vulnerable and unhoused and for the communities where they reside. We can’t let that be the legacy of this heartbreaking case.Svante MyrickWashingtonThe writer is president of People for the American Way.MSNBC’s Role in Our DemocracyTo the Editor:Re “Fight at NBC Over Left Tilt From MSNBC” (front page, May 16):News outlets that see U.S. politics as normal are the problem, not MSNBC.Republicans have become a rogue political party, supporting insurrection and refusing to accept legitimate election results. They refuse to accept the fundamental principles that determine fair elections. As such, there is no longer any equivalency between Democrats and Republicans.As a nation, we need to re-establish a healthy two-party adversarial system that abides by democratic rules. That can be done only if we survive the present threat to our constitutional system of governance.MSNBC is more concerned about saving our democracy than promoting political ideology. Long may it wave.Chase WebbPortland, Ore.This article appeared in print on page A19."
