Yeah, well, except for those sad bastards at Disney, it's gotten so badthey're going to fire 7,000people as part of a significant transformation. It's the biggest transformation since Kilmeade's lunch turned into a butterfly. Yeah, he eats caterpillars, bet you didn't know that.The job cuts are part of a bigger strategy to save $5.5 billion, which is more than enough to pay for the sex change surgeries for the Pirates of the Caribbean.

Gone are the days when their movies and cartoons actually taught children life lessons. I mean, remember that wooden-peg-legged-lion-little-bitch Pinocchio? He taught children not to fib, or you'll get eaten by a whale and die. To be honest, I never understood what whales have to do with lying until I saw The View. I don't get it. And remember that slutty Little Mermaid Ariel, with clamshells for a bra and a mouthy little crab. Nobody told her drugstores have medicines for those. But she taught a generation of young women that you can overcome a disability. I mean, she was a cartoon mermaid. I mean, that's a hard life if she can't stand up. How could she make me a sandwich?ANNOUNCER:A sexist would say!And then there's the 101 Dalmatians. What lessons did you learn from that? Well, I've learned that there are better puppies for your coats. I mean, it's kind of ugly when you think about it. Cinderella taught us that love comes not from your dress or your station in life, but from the shoes you're wearing. And Bambi, bambi taught us to always wear orange in the forest. Yeah, RIP.
