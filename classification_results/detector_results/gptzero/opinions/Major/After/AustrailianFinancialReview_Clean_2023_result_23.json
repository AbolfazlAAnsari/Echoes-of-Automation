He followed this up by sexually harassing and demeaning women and men who called him out, myself included. He then continued his abuse of me via email, including talking about my work location.This is where I made a series of very deliberate choices. LinkedIn did not offer a satisfactory response to the harassment we had endured. This absence of a means for recourse in \"fringe\" workplace settings, such as on LinkedIn or at networking events, is a problem for many women in our ecosystem. The value of the networking opportunities in these two settings is immense. But for many women, the cost of participating is to risk being sexually assaulted, as Elaine recently experienced.Or, we risk enduring the type of misogynistic vitriol that chips away at our humanity bit by bit, day by day, and enrages, infuriates, and exhausts us at a soul level.Adding to this are the near-constant demands, predominantly from men, to prove the abuse and discrimination we suffer - which is exactly what Joel's first comment demanded.The demands come as if the vast number of articles and research papers already doing just that are inadequate, and we must whip up a more compelling one on the spot that will satisfy the demands of a man committed to not being satisfied on the topic.So, I thought: no way. In my reply to Joel, I CC'd in every prominent technology journalist who I knew was also a feminist -i.e. a safe witness to the showdown - and escalated the PR crisis he had caused.You want to be a big man talking about banging women while we're just trying to work? Let's communicate your \"values\" at scale. Private communication with him during that day, on the back of those emails, eventually forced a private apology and a complete turnaround in his attitude - a highly self-serving one, you might say. But one that I have since seen demonstrated to be genuine in several ways.In the absence of any other formal mechanisms to bring him into line, it was the power of women speaking out - including Elaine's post - that forced a serial pest to finally apologise for what might just be the very first time in history.Yet I was just one of dozens of victims. And when men espouse their misogyny publicly against one woman, it hurts womankind by creating an unsafe and exhausting world for women and girls.Given this, the target of his apology needed to be far broader than just myself.After many hours of negotiation, Joel and I agreed he should make a public apology from his corporate account. His personal account had been deactivated, so this was his only means to apologise in the forum where he had spewed his most recent abuse.He wrote the first draft, and I helped to shape his words to incorporate the way his damage extended far beyond the women he had directly hurt.He also agreed that \"sexual harassment\" is not a symptom of PTSD, so his promise of therapy must be to address his misogyny, too.We added a means for affected women to speak with Joel, though in retrospect this should have been a promise for Joel to contact them instead. After this feedback, he has promised to reach out instead.To Joel's credit, he accepted every word of my advice with humility and gratitude. And he knew this advice wasn't about protecting his reputation. It was about taking ownership for what he had done.Did Joel deserve this level of grace? Maybe. Maybe not. But that's not the point. The women he abused deserved the apology, and the steps he has committed to taking - several of which he has since taken, including stepping down as CEO of the company he founded. More importantly, the message it has sent to the industry appears already to be resonating with some key stakeholders and powerbrokers.When women are silenced, their mistreatment sits in silos of pain, and perpetrators continue with the impunity provided by fear. When we speak out, we tap into the power of collective rage and action.But it can't just be the women and victims who join in and lead this charge for change.No victim owes a perpetrator forgiveness or absolution at any point, ever. But when the wrongdoer fully owns his actions, expresses genuine contrition via \"costly\" acts, then goes on to demonstrate a lasting behaviour change, there is power in creating space for this change.We as an ecosystem must keep perpetrators like Joel accountable for their words. But we can also consider how a path to redemption might help to create the type of industry-wide change that is at the heart of why we speak out in the first place.Hannah Moreno is the founder and managing director of climate, tech, and finance PR agency Third Hemisphere."
