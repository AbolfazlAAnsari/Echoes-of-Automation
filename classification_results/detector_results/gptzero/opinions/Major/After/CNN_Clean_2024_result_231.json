Kyrsten Sinema happy now?The two centrist senators recently announced their departures after years of serving as a\"heat shield\" for their moderateandelectorally vulnerable Democratic colleaguesby publicly holding up controversial legislation and drawing subsequent attacks from liberal critics.Not only are Manchin and Sinema leaving the Senate, but Democrats are paying a steep electoral price for their leftward lurch. Theshare of Democrats who identify as liberal has hit a record high, while the share of overallvoters identifying as Democrats has hit a historic low. Disruptive activists and members of Congress on the left who have called the Democratic Party \"too big of a tent\" appear to be getting what they want: a smaller, but more ideologically rigid, party.Such a party will struggle to win. Voters now prefer Republicans inthe generic ballot for Congress. One election forecastpredictsa four-seat GOP majority in the next Senate. Leftist activists have supercharged a perception that Democrats are beholden to their left flank, causingvoters to align closer to the GOP than to Democrats on the ideological spectrum.There are differences between Sinema - a complex figure who has identified as independent since 2022 and represents a state in which Democrats running for Senate, governor or president haveconsistently wonin recent years - and the electoral miracle of Manchin, a Democrat in a very red state. But harassment tactics directed at the centrist senators have been similar. Sinema noted that being chased into a bathroom by activists about hermoderate stance on immigrationpolicy was \"no legitimate protest,\" and she was right. While Manchin has always beenemphatic about the right to protest,protests at his home - and by kayak - also crossed a line.Did protests impact the legislative agenda or retirement decisions of Manchin and Sinema? There is no evidence to suggest so. But it's hard to imagine it encouraged them to stick around. Andpolitical science researchsuggests such ideologically charged harassment may prevent future moderate candidates from even running for office in the first place. It would be a shame if the forces that have antagonized Sinema and Manchin within the party see their departures as reason for doubling down on their bad behavior.These forces are not only sporadic volunteer activists but often professionals with acoherent strategybacked bymegadonors and foundations. Theexplicitgoal of the donor behind the group that \"bird-dogged\" Manchin, for example, is \"not giving him any peace.\"It is not just the radicals who are at fault. They are being cheered on by people who should know better. You would think that other members of Congress would abhor the efforts of disruptive groups like the Manchin-harassing Climate Defiance. But Rep.Ro Khannaof California and\"Squad\"members including Reps.Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bushof Missouri participate in swanky fundraising events with ultra-wealthy Climate Defiance supporters likeheiress Abigail DisneyThese leftist disruptors and their congressional associates are winning some battles. But they will lose the war. There are two ways for disruptive progressive activists to lose: One is for them to be defeated within the party by more pragmatic Democrats. The other path is successfully changing the party brand or kicking moderates out of the party, which would cause the Democratic Party - the standard bearer for issues such as welcoming immigration and acting on the climate - to lose.Political science research is clearthat moderate candidates perform better.But it is not just about the candidate - actions associated with the party can damage the overall party brand.An MIT Election Lab studyshowed independent voters became 7 points less likely to support Democrats just by reading a single neutral news article about the presidential primary debates featuring arguments for progressive policy.Appeasing the angry, extremist left has been a major mistake for Democrats - both morally and electorally. Too many in the party simply accept it. But mainstream Democrats can fight back and win elections in the process.Two viral videos last week give some hope that the tide may be turning. One shows the potential for pushback, even on the far left. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, another Squad member, was chased out of a movie theater by pro-Palestinian protesters who demanded that she call Israel's war on Hamas a \"genocide.\" Sheangrily fought back, saying she had in fact used the terminology and making clear the harm of the activists' tactics: \"It's f**ked up, man. It is not helping these people. You're not helping them.\"That video mostly made the rounds in conservative media. But the message is even more important for Democrats: These activists are not helping the causes they claim to champion.Nowhere is that more clear than with Manchin, who deliveredbillions in clean-energy investmentsthrough the Inflation Reduction Act while representing a state that then-President Donald Trumpwonby nearly 39 points in 2020.Days before the AOC video, there was a similarlyaggressive protest against Manchin that went viralwhen an aide forcefully pushed back a Climate Defiance activist who burst into a Harvard study room and shouted obscenities at the sitting senator. Manchin has pushed back figuratively against online attacks for years, and now his aide literally pushed back against aggressive progressive activists' physical intimidation - andsocial media loved it.There is still time for other Democrats to push back. It may not save the Senate, but it can stem losses. The party's leader, President Joe Biden, seems to be fearful of the activist left - so much so that his campaign isavoiding college campusesand talking about clearly popular things like the record energy production thatpolls show voters like but his administration intentionally downplays.The time to push back is now. Democrats cannot cower to disruptive leftists. As the departures of Sinema and Manchin show, the big tent is shrinking at the worst possible time.Opinion by Liam KerrTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
