On the political side, similar trends are apparent. A recent Washington Post article entitled, \"Meet the mega-donors pumping millions into the 2022 midterms,\" ranked Soros number one on the list with $128.5 million in contributions insupport of Democrat candidates.Soros’ massive financial support for left-wing candidates has opened doors in Washington at the highest levels of government. According to the New York Post, Alexander Soros \"scored at least a dozen meetings with White House officials in 2022, according to recently updated White House visitor logs.\" Additionally, Tom Perriello, the executive director of an arm of Open Society Foundations, also visited the Biden White House multiple times in recent years.When it comes to Biden policy and Soros policy, it’s tough to tell where one ends and the other begins.According to Open Society Foundations’ website, on theissue of voting rights, \"politics in the United States have been marked by partisan assaults on voting rights.\"George Soros delivers a speech during the 2023 Munich Security Conference.(Open Society Foundations/YouTube/Video screenshot)SOROS-BACKED POLICY GROUP NOTCHES VICTORY WITH BIDEN'S TRANSGENDER TITLE IX RULESOn immigration, the group says they \"support a range of groups thatwork on immigration issues, from local and state organizations that provide frontline legal advice, to individuals seeking asylum or facing deportation.\"Oncriminal justice reform, Open Society Foundations \"advocate for an approach to policing that emphasizes community engagement and accountability, particularly for the use of force.\"And on climate issues, Soros recently tweeted, \"Climate change is an existential threat to our civilization.\"If any of these statements were attributed to Joe Biden instead of someone in Soros world, no one would blink.When it comes to Biden policy and Soros policy, it’s tough to tell where one ends and the other begins.(CBS/Paramount Plus/'The Daily Show'/YouTube)The problem with these positions is that they are both failed and dishonest. Turnout statistics indicate that Biden’s divisive attacks on voter suppression are a total farce; the Biden administration’s lawless immigration policy has created a war zone and fentanyl epidemic at the border; the left’s drive to \"reimagine policing\" has caused crime and the feeling of danger to skyrocket in our cities; and the irresponsible push for wasteful spending on the green new deal agenda has caused an inflation crisis that won’t go away.In addition, the Soros pet project of bankrolling the campaigns of left-wing district attorneys and local prosecutors around the country has been extremely detrimental to the American ideal of law and order. Unsurprisingly, Soros is in complete denial. In fact, if an op-ed he penned on the subject is any indication, he may be more out of touch than President Biden himself.Soros opined that \"reform-minded prosecutors and other law-enforcement officials around the country have been coalescing around an agenda that promises to be more effective and just.\" It takes just a cursory look at what’s going on in Chicago and so many other cities to realize that nothing could be further from the truth.But Soros continued his tall tale by saying, \"the funds I provide enable sensible reform-minded candidates to receive a hearing from the public. Judging by the results, the public likes what it’s hearing. \"This is absurd. Poll after poll say that Americans are very concerned about the rise in crime.And perhaps most alarmingly, the tone-deaf Soros has indicated he’s planning to continue his assault on safe streets in the future. He boasted in the article that he has \"no intention of stopping\" his support of radical prosecutors like Kimberly Gardner in St. Louis, Larry Krasner in Philadelphia, and Kim Foxx in Chicago.If there’s a silver lining in the case of Alvin Bragg’s sham indictment of Donald Trump, maybe it will be the country refocusing on the failed radical agenda of George Soros, his family and their deep-pocketed organizations that are driving the Democrat Party’s dangerous lurch to the left in the areas of crime, illegal immigration,and climate change. It won’t be a moment too soon.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID BOSSIE"
