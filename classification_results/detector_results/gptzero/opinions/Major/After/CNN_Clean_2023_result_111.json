In Weiner's case, the former congressmantold Politicothat the committee's preliminary inquiry - and the prospect of a full-fledged investigation - was the reason he stepped down.More fundamentally, resignation ends the committee's jurisdiction, and so concludes these politically painful inquisitions. In a statement declaring his resignation,Meehan explainedhis choice by stating, \"While I do believe I would be exonerated of any wrongdoing, I also did not want to put my staff through the rigors of an Ethics Committee investigation and believed it was best for them to have a head start on new employment rather than being caught up in an inquiry. And since I have chosen to resign, the inquiry will not become a burden to taxpayers and committee staff.\"For all these reasons, congressional history is replete withother examplesof members resigning upon the announcement of an investigation by the Ethics Committee.Whatever happens next, Santos has done what so little in contemporary American politics can: unite a sizable chunk of Congress and elicit bipartisan condemnation. That is foremost evidenced by the fact that the Ethics Committee,split evenlybetween Republicans and Democrats,voted unanimouslyto open an investigation. Beyond that, a number ofRepublican colleaguesfrom Santos' own statehave called on him to resign, as have Republican officials inNassau Countyin the 3rd Congressional District.Even House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who must balance the mounting public pressure to crack down on Santos with securing every vote of his slim majority, has claimed that Republicans \"will remove him\" if the Ethics Committee determines that the embattled congressman committed a crime.In that regard, an Ethics Committee investigation need not interfere with and could indeed complement anyfederal and state law enforcement investigationsof Santos' conduct. The Justice Department has asked the Federal Election Commission to pause any action against Santos and provide relevant documents to federal prosecutors instead,The Washington Post reported. Federal prosecutors in New York are also investigating the lawmaker's finances,a source told CNN,andBrazilian authorities said they intendto revive fraud charges against Santos in a case that had previously been suspended because police were unable to locate him.Santos responded to theallegationsin an interview with theNew York Post, saying, \"I am not a criminal here - not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world. Absolutely not.\"While these investigations unfold, they do not render moot the Ethics Committee's own inquiry.There isa precedent for committee investigationsto proceed alongside law enforcement investigations or even after those probes have concluded. The panel enjoys uniquefact-findingandjurisdictionalheft.And, if the evidence points to violations of federal or state law, the ethics body, like other House committees, can bolster these external investigations by passing onits investigative findingsto the relevant law enforcement bodies. Indeed, the January 6 committee achievedone of its most impactful legaciesby making criminal referrals to the Department of Justice.The persistent drip of scandals has so far failed to topple Santos' congressional career. But we could look back on the Ethics Committee's announcement and see in hindsight that the congressman's days were numbered.Opinion by Norman Eisen and Colby GalliherTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
