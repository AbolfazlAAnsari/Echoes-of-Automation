Abreakthroughcame just thirty years ago when the wars in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo saw the devastating and deliberate use ofmass sexual violence. This evoked a loudresponsefrom global women's organizations and human rights activists. They yelled in horror and fought for change. Under pressure, the United Nations Security Council created theInternational Criminal Tribunalfor the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 1993 with an unprecedented commitment to prosecute rape as a crime against humanity along with other war crimes.US leaders on both sides of the aisle, especially women, have taken a strong stand against the use of rape as a tactic of war. In 1995, then first lady and future secretary of state Hillary Clinton traveled to China, and in her famous \"Women's Rights Are Human Rights\"speech, insisted that \"it is a violation of human rights ... when thousands of women are subjected to rape as a tactic or prize of war.\" In 2008, addressing the use of sexual violence in armed conflict, Secretary of State Condoleezza Ricestatedthat \"rape is a crime that can never be condoned.\" The world agreed.Not loudly condemning the rapes of October 7 - or any rapes - is a massive step backward for the women - and men - of the world. The ground gained was hard-fought and must not be lost. This is as true for Israel as forUkrainewhere Russian soldiers have been accused of sexually brutalizing victims from ages four to 82. According to one United Nations report, a pair of Russian soldiers brutally raped a 22-year-oldmother repeatedly and sexually assaulted her husband.Next, one of the soldiers raped their four-year-old daughter.Investigationsof these reprehensible crimes are underway, but as always, prosecution of these cases is difficult. Cries for justice will help victims, who deserve our unconditional support.Dr. Denis Mukwegehas spent his life providing medical, psychological and legal assistance to survivors of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At Panzi Hospital, which he founded in 1999, he and his staff have cared for more than 50,000 survivors. Mukwege's vocal advocacy against rape as a weapon of war has led to both an assassination attempt and aNobel Peace Prize. As he accepted his award in Oslo, hedeclared, \"With this Nobel Peace Prize, I call on the world to be a witness and I urge you to join us in order to put an end to this suffering that shames our common humanity.\"Today, it's urgent that we add our voices to Mukwege's. No matter what you believe should happen in the Middle East - I personally support a two-state solution where a Palestinian state and Israel co-exist so that both their populations can enjoy peace and security - we can surely unite against these atrocities. We can each \"be a witness\" and together call out this unacceptable horror and unimaginable suffering.We must denounce these rapes in every conversation, at every rally, and on signs held on every street corner. We must forget our conflicting politics and remember our common humanity.Opinion by Sheryl SandbergTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
