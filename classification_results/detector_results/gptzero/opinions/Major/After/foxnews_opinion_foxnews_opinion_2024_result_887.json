Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, discusses the latest developments as the House launches new government oversight probes into Hunter Biden on 'Hannity.'In the 1966 movie \"A Man for All Seasons,\" Sir Thomas More faces Richard Rich,an ambitious office seekerwho would ultimately lie and betray him. In this British historical drama, More warns Rich that \"when a man takes an oath, he's holding his own self in his own hands like water, and if he opens his fingers then, he needn't hope to find himself again.\"This week, Democrats appear to have finally drained away what remained of themselves and their party. For years, Democratic members and the media have demanded any evidence of the direct involvement or knowledge ofPresident Joe Bidenof the influence-peddling operation of his son, Hunter, and his brothers, James and Frank.In the hearing, witnesses testified under oath about specific meetings with Joe Biden discussing these foreign dealings and the family business interests. Bank records were introduced showing the transfers of millions going to Hunter and various Biden family members.TOP CHAOTIC MOMENTS FROM THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT HEARING INTO BIDEN FAMILY'S 'INFLUENCE PEDDLING'Faced with the evidence that the president lied about his lack of any knowledge or involvement in the influence peddling, the Democrats opened their fingers wider.Rep. Dan Goldman, D., N.Y., captured the problem for Democrats in even addressing any of the mounting evidence contradicting the president. Yet, Goldman has long shown a willingness to rush in where angels fear to tread.In previous attacks, Goldman repeatedly hit the Bidens with friendly fire when eliciting damaging answers from witnesses. Goldman has a habit of raising the worst evidence that his colleagues have avoided. In one hearing, he stumbled badly in raising the WhatsApp message whereHunter told a Chinese businessmanthat his father was sitting next to him and would not be pleased unless he sent him money. Onanother occasion, he prompted an IRS whistleblower to note that an email Goldman read into the record was actually a direct contradiction of the denials of the president.HUNTER BIDEN'S EX-BUSINESS PARTNER TONY BOBULINSKI SLAMS HIM FOR 'RUNNING AWAY' FROM HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEEIn the latest misstep, Goldman pressedformer Biden partner Tony Bobulinskion a proposal shared with Hunter and others to reserve 10% for \"the Big Guy.\" In other emails, Bobulinski was told to use such codes to avoid mentioning Joe Biden's name. He was expressly identified as \"the Big Guy.\"Goldman snapped at Bobulinski, \"Did anyone ever respond to that email?\"Bobulinski responded \"Yes, they did numerous times. Hunter himself did.\"Goldman blurted out \"you're right\" before angrily reclaiming his time to cut him off.Things did not prove any easier for other members.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D., N.Y., imploded by mocking Bobulinski and challenging him \"It is simple, you name the crime. Did you watch him steal something?\"HUNTER BIDEN'S EX-BUSINESS PARTNER TONY BOBULINSKI SLAMS HIM FOR 'RUNNING AWAY' FROM HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEEBobulinski proceeded to rattle off a series of possible criminal acts and Ocasio-Cortez cut him off. She then bizarrely then pretended that he did not just list the crimes and barked \"What is the crime, sir? Specifically?\"Bobulinski was not the only one confused and noted \"you ask and answer the question, I answered the question, RICO, you're obviously not familiar with...\"That is whenOcasio-Cortez again cut him offwith \"Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, sir. RICO is not a crime, it is a category. What is the crime?\"AOC TAKES HEAT OVER 'RICO IS NOT A CRIME' COMMENT IN BIDEN IMPEACHMENT PROBE HEARINGWith that, it appears that Trump has now been cleared of charges in Atlanta by no one other than Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Racketeering is a crime and some of the crimes referenced by Bobulinski are commonly part of such conspiracies.The exchange captured the lunacy of the hearing as Democrats demanded evidence and then ignored it when it was repeatedly offered by witnesses and members.Yet, Ocasio-Cortez was illuminating on one point. Neither she nor her colleagues were willing to admit the obvious. Few people now disagree that Hunter was openly engaging in influence peddling, which is a form of corruption that the government has long fought around the world. It is also clear that Joe Biden knew of that influence peddling not just from his son but newspaper accounts. He had knowledge of the corruption and facilitated it.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONHowever, Ocasio-Cortez wanted to ignore the millions of dollars acquired in influence peddling to press a witness on whether he saw the president steal something like a purse or a hubcap.The Democrats have allowed their very identity to drip through their open fingers. They have become aparty that calls for censorship, ballot cleansing, and court packing. Now it excuses raw influence peddling after opposing every effort to investigate it.As a lifelong Democrat from apolitically active Chicago family, I can no longer recognize the party from my youth. We once stood for something other than the next election or hating others.By the end of the hearing, virtually every Democratic member had attacked the witnesses and denied the obvious corruption surrounding the Biden family. They had become a party of Richard Riches. Of course, this unified effort to deny the obvious left little time to look down at what remained in their hands. They had owned the moment when the party fought to shield one of the most extensive and lucrative influence peddling operations in history.After that ignoble effort, there was little reason to look down since they \"needn't hope to find [themselves] again.\" JONATHAN TURLEYJonathan Turley is a Fox News Media contributor and the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University. He is the author of \"The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage\" (Simon & Schuster, June 18, 2024).Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
