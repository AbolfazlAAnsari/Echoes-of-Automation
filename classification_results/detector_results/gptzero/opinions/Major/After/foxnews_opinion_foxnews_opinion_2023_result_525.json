So, at the urging of her attorney, Alice chose to exercise her constitutional right to a fair and impartial trial.What the prosecution did next can only be described as retaliation. It brought new drug conspiracy charges against Alice that had not been considered before, accusing her of attempted possession of 106 kilograms of cocaine.WHAT IS THE FIRST STEP ACT? 5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM LAWNo physical evidence was ever found to support this, but physical evidence was not required at the time. Instead, to make its case, the prosecution coerced two of Alice’s co-defendants to change their testimonies in exchange for reduced sentences, pinning the blame on Alice.Alice – who had $500 in her bank account at her sentencing – was labeled a \"quintessential entrepreneur\" and sentenced to life in prison based solely on coerced testimony. And due to mandatory minimum sentencing laws, the judge in her case could not have doled out a more lenient sentence had she wanted to.Today, laws are on the books to prevent convictions without physical evidence. However, mandatory minimum sentencing laws still exist, and the \"trial penalty\" – the increase in sentencing for those who choose to go to trial rather than take a plea deal – is very much alive.Alice's trial is the perfect example of how perverse incentives within the criminal justice system, spurred by the failed \"War on Drugs,\" ruin lives and tear families apart while doing nothing to improve public safety.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONProsecutors, many of whom go into the profession to pursue the noble ideals of justice and safety, are not immune to these warped incentives that put convictions over justice. Drug laws are easily manipulated, and low-level players like Alice are sent to prison while higher-level, more dangerous people remain on the streets.Instead of being bitter about her sentence, Alice dedicated herself to helping others while in prison. She continued to do amazing work upon her release, helping 46 other deserving people get clemencies, pardons and compassionate releases through her organization, Taking Action for Good, and fighting for historicreforms like the First Step Act.Around 95% of inmates will eventually be released. How do you want them to return to your community?(iStock)The First Step Act is a landmark, bipartisan achievement that, among other things, institutes evidence-based programming in federal prisons to reduce recidivism and help incarcerated people successfully re-enter society. Individuals released under the First Step Act are recidivating at about a quarter of the rate we would expect to see from all federal prisoners. The legislation is an incredible feat that should be championed and replicated.There are nearly2 million people incarceratedin the United States, many of them with similar stories to Alice. Around 95% of those people will eventually be released. How do you want them to return to your community?Policymakers and politicians who claim toprioritize reducing crimeand increasing public safety should continue adopting evidence-based, smart-on-crime policies like the First Step Act while rejecting laws like the ones that allowed prosecutors to put Alice Marie Johnson away for life.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM BRETT TOLMANBrett Tolman is executive director for Right on Crime and former United States attorney for the District of Utah.
