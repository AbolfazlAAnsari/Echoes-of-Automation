As a result, you have neighborhoods where not only folks struggle with basic arithmetic and reading, but they also struggle with financial literacy, furthering increasing childhood poverty rates.Not only is fatherhood essential for the development of children, but data shows also that children who grow up without their fathers have sizable decreases in academic performance in school, a lower likelihood of economic stability and lower opportunity at social mobility.So, the question remains, what can we do? At The Jack Brewer Foundation we are not only dedicated to increasing awareness about this growing problem, but also doing something about it. From feeding 5,000 children on a daily basis, delivering hundreds of thousands of pounds of food for struggling families, to donating thousands of sets of clothing: our objectives are clear.In order to address this issue, it will take not only a chorus of voices, but a congregation of men and women dedicated to living Christ’s mission. While we have had some success throughout all levels of government — such as a record level grant from the state of Florida to address the fatherhood crisis — there is still much to be done.I call on you all to adhere to the word of the Lord as said in James 1:22 \"But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.\" Only then can we look to save our children and therefore our future.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JACK BREWERJack Brewer, is a former NFL safety and 3x team captain who played for the Vikings, Giants, Eagles and Cardinals.
