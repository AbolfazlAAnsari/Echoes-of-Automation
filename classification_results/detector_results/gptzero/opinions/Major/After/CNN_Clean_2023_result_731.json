India was the big hope for a China offset.\"Facing an election between now and 2025, Trudeau needs to keep domestic political considerations in mind going forward.Canadians of Indian origin represent a significant voting bloc, almost four percent of the population or 1.3 million; more than half of them Sikhs, including minority opposition leaderJagmeet Singhwhose New Democratic Party keeps Trudeau's ruling Liberals in power.If the relationship with India becomes more corrosive, it could impact the ailing Canadian economy: Indian students representa whopping 40% of total overseas foreign students, it isone of Canada's top ten trading partnersand thefourth biggest sourceof tourism.For Trudeau, who has survivedthree ethics violationsand will go down in history asthe first Canadian prime minister to be found guilty of breaking federal ethics laws, the crisis occurs in the background ofplummeting ratings, brought about by a stubborncost of livingandhousing crisis.A cynic might say that prematurely publicizing the explosive findings against India is a diversion tactic to steer attention away from the China interference file and the domestic issues piling up. Or that it is simply amateur hour at the offices of the prime minister and foreign affairs.Or - as was acknowledged Tuesday inan Atlantic Council panel on the sidelines of the UNGeneral Assembly - that major actors are increasingly leaning into transnational repression to eliminate or silence opponents. Goody-two-shoes Canada, wanting to defend freedom of expression at home, innocently finds itself in the jaws of the very superpowers it is trying to court.Whatever the case,even for someone described as being made of Teflon, the consequences of the India crisis for Trudeau could be politically fatal if not deftly handled - especially with Ottawa's traditional best friend, Washington, unlikely to throw a lifeline.Opinion by Michael BociurkiwTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
