Under the Biden plan, only 11 percent would fully repay before reaching forgiveness.\"The Urban Institute further estimates, \"The Biden plan would have a similar effect for bachelor’s degree recipients. The share fully paying off their loans would fall from 59 percent under current [income driven repayment plans] to 22 percent, and the share repaying no more than half of what they borrowed would increase from 22 percent to 49 percent.\"That means under the SAVE plan, about 78 percent to 89 percent of all undergraduate student loan borrowers will receive some kind of debt cancellation, and one out of every two borrowers will pay less than half of their debts before receiving forgiveness.The Urban Institute’s conclusion is in line with estimates made by the Biden administration. It found that under the SAVE plan, the average amount of debt repaid for every $10,000 borrowed would fall from an average of $10,956 under the current model to $6,121. That means under Biden’s plan, the average student loan borrower will end up receiving huge amounts of loan forgiveness.How much will this gigantic government scheme cost American taxpayers? Federal officials claim the SAVE plan will cost an additional $138 billion over the next 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office, however, says the cost is closer to $230 billion, and the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates the cost to be $361 billion over a decade.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThe U.S. Department of Education building stands in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, Aug. 18, 2020.

Because there is no sunset for Biden’s new repayment policy, and because the existing cost estimates don’t consider the large amounts of debt that will be forgiven in the years well beyond the decade-long study period, the cost will ultimately be much larger than any of the 10-year estimates.Perhaps more importantly, many researchers have yet to include in their studies the cost of additional borrowing. Once students realize that half or more of their student loan debt will almost certainly be covered by taxpayers, they will likely increase their spending on tuition and cost of living.With these factors in mind, given enough time, the SAVE plan will likely cost far more than $1 trillion.Biden’s SAVE plan is one of the most radical, deeply unfair, socialistic policies in decades, and unlike Biden's other student debt cancellation proposals, there’s very little chance the Supreme Court will block it. Only members of Congress have the power to stand up to this out-of-control administration.The biggest question that remains is, will they?CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JUSTIN HASKINSJustin Haskins is the director of the Socialism Research Center at The Heartland Institute and a New York Times bestselling author.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
