American workers and businesses turned out to be more resilient and adaptable than they were given credit for. Also, our policymakers didn’t make the mistakes that followed the 2008 financial crisis, when an underpowered fiscal stimulus was followed by a premature turn to austerity that delayed a full recovery for many years. Instead, the Biden administration went big on spending, probably contributing to a temporary burst of inflation but also helping to ensure rapid recovery — and at this point the inflation has largely faded away while the recovery remains.Beyond that, the verysurge in immigrationthat has nativists so upset has played a big role in increasing the economy’s potential.The budget office recently upgraded its medium-term economic projections, largely because it believes that increased immigration will add to the work force. It estimates that the immigration surge will addabout 2 percentto real G.D.P. by 2034.But are immigrants taking jobs away from native-born Americans? No. A recent analysis by Goldman Sachs contains this really interesting chart:In case you’re wondering, “SA by GS” refers to the fact that official data aren’t adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, so Goldman Sachs has done its own seasonal adjustment.This chart shows no rise in native-born unemployment during the immigration surge. It does show a rise in foreign-born unemployment, which I’ll come back to. But for now let’s just note that there is no good evidence that immigrants are taking away jobs from workers born in America.Still, doesn’t immigration put downward pressure on wages? That sounds as if it could be true — in particular, you might think that immigrants with relatively little formal education compete with less educated native-born workers. I used to believe this myself.But many (although not all) academic studies find that immigration haslittle effecton the wages of native-born workers, even when those workers have similar education levels. Instead of being substitutes for native-born workers, immigrants often seem to complement them, bringing different skills and concentrating in different occupations.In some ways the current immigration surge, probably consisting mainly of less educated workers (especially among the undocumented), is a test case. Have wages for lower-wage workers declined? On the contrary, what we’ve seen recently is a surprising move toward wage equality, with big gainsat the bottom:Overall, then, immigration appears to have been a big plus for U.S. economic growth, among other things expanding our productive capacity in a way that reduced the inflationary impact of Biden’s spending programs.It’s also important to realize that immigration, if it continues (and if a future Trump administration doesn’t round up millions of people for deportation), will help pay for Social Security and Medicare. C.B.O.expects91 percent of adult immigrants between 2022 and 2034 to be under 55, compared with 62 percent for the overall population. That means a substantial number of additional workers paying into the system without collecting retirement benefits for many years.Finally, let me return to that Goldman Sachs chart on unemployment rates, which shows no rise in unemployment among the native-born but a significant rise among the foreign-born. Believe it or not, that’s probably good news.Goldman argues that the rise in foreign-born unemployment reflects a longstanding tendency for recent immigrants to have relatively high unemployment, presumably because it takes some time for many of them to get settled into sustained employment; unemployment is much lower among immigrants who have been here three years or more.Why is this probably good news? The overall U.S. unemployment rate has crept up recently — not enough to trigger theSahm rule, which links rising unemployment to recessions, but enough to make me and othersa bit nervous.Goldman argues, however, that this time is different. All of the rise in unemployment is among foreign-born workers — and this, they suggest, means that we aren’t seeing the kind of weakening in demand for labor that presages recessions. What we’re seeing instead, they argue, is an increase in labor supply, with many of the new workers taking some time to find their feet. If so, the Sahm rule, which has been spectacularly successful in the past, may currently be misleading.I hope they’re right.The bottom line is that while America’s immigration system is dysfunctional and really needs more resources — resources it would be getting if Republicans, pushed by Trump, hadn’t turned their backs on a bill they helped devise — the recent surge in immigration has actually been good for the economy so far, and gives us reason to be more optimistic about the future.Quick HitsAsummaryof that Goldman Sachs study.Another time dark-skinned immigrants (that is, Italians) were accused offostering violent crime.There are more bad economists — in the sense of beingbad people— than I would ever have suspected.New business creation issurging.Facing the Music[Video:Watch on YouTube.]“Dune: Part Two” is terrific, but I wanted moreSardaukar chanting.PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Illustration by Sam Whitney/The New York Times; images by Caroline Purser and kitthanes/Getty Images FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
