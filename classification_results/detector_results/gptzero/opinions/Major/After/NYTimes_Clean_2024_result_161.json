            "inputText": "Applicants have ways to better their odds, but employers need to make changes, too.Many new college graduates are having an awful time finding jobs, as I wrote inApriland in earlyMay. I’ve been trying to understand why, and I think I’m getting closer to more answers.There’s lots of anecdotal evidence that something is wrong. Please take a listen to a new episode of “The Opinions”podcastI did with John York, a 24-year-old with a master’s degree in math from New York University who grabbed my attention when hewrote methat “it feels like I am screaming into the void with each application I am filling out.” Derek Arthur, the producer of the podcast, interviewed other young graduates, including one who said he had sent out over 500 applications with no luck.At first blush, stories like York’s seem like outliers, since the unemployment rate is still pretty low — 3.9 percent in April. But a report this week by Elsie Peng, an economist at Goldman Sachs, shows that the anecdotes point to something real.Digging into Bureau of Labor Statistics data, Peng found a recent decline in the job-finding rate of new entrants to the labor force. Fresh college grads make up a big chunk of that group.The chart above, which I made from Goldman’s data, shows that the hiring rate for new entrants to the labor force is below its average since mid-2000, even as the hiring rate for experienced workers remains well above its average.This next chart shows that the hiring rate for people with a bachelor’s degree or more (not just new grads) has fallen off recently, while the rate for people with less than a bachelor’s degree has stayed high.I asked Goldman’s economics team why finding a job has gotten harder for new entrants and college grads (and presumably especially hard for new entrants who are college grads). In an email, the team wrote that “we have not looked into the specific drivers” but said there are several potential reasons. Among them:•For 2024 grads, studying remotely during Covid “may have affected their training, networking, and human and social capital accumulation.”•There are still some worker shortages, but mainly for low-skilled jobs.•The labor market may simply be “moving into better balance,” allowing employers to become more selective.•Some people with student loan debt who weren’t working may have been forced back into the labor market by the need to resume payments on their loans, adding to competition for jobs.For 2024 grads, studying remotely during Covid “may have affected their training, networking, and human and social capital accumulation.”There are still some worker shortages, but mainly for low-skilled jobs.The labor market may simply be “moving into better balance,” allowing employers to become more selective.Some people with student loan debt who weren’t working may have been forced back into the labor market by the need to resume payments on their loans, adding to competition for jobs.I also spoke to a lot of people in and around the hiring business who helped me understand at ground level why the college-to-job transmission belt is working poorly.“We see a lot of caution and uncertainty” from employers, Karin Kimbrough, the chief economist of LinkedIn, told me. They’re uncertain about the outlook for interest rates and consumer demand, she said, “making them very cautious” about hiring.Even though the unemployment rate is low, fewer people are quitting, so fewer jobs are becoming available, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. LinkedIn’s estimate of the national hiring rate was down9.5 percent in Aprilfrom a year earlier.One point I heard over and over is that simply tossing your résumé and cover letter into a company’s job portal has a low probability of success, especially now. It’s so easy to submit applications that companies are being bombarded with thousands of them. Human beings can’t possibly review all of them, so they’re reviewed by computers, which simply search for keywords. They don’t understand in any deep way either the applicant’s qualities or the employer’s needs.“The better writer you are, the greater your chance of getting rejected, because you won’t use keywords” the way the evaluation algorithm wants, Nick Corcodilos, a recruiter who runs the website Ask the Headhunter, told me. Personal contact is crucial, he said. Rather than spraying applications far and wide, he recommends focusing on a handful of companies, researching them in depth and contacting a wide range of people connected with them, even their suppliers and customers.College work experience can make a difference too, according to Jane Swift, a former lieutenant governor and acting governor of Massachusetts who’s now the president of Education at Work, a nonprofit that helps students get internships related to their chosen fields while they’re still in school. Those college jobs, she wrote to me, “enhance prospects for a good first job and a career filled with purpose and passion.”Fixing the college-to-job transmission belt should be partly employers’ responsibility, not just applicants’. That’s especially true for applicants from groups whose potential tends to be underestimated, such as single mothers, Joan Lynch, the chief content and programming officer of WorkingNation, a media nonprofit that promotes ways to fix unemployment and underemployment, told me. “It takes opening their eyes and saying, ‘Oh, this is a valuable employee,’” she said.The bad news is that more and more evidence suggests that getting a good job right out of college is really tough. The good news is that a lot of people are aware of the problem and striving to do something about it.The Readers WriteYouwrotethat people dislike inflation — Japan is no exception. Everyone is so frustrated. However, in this country the central bank is not fighting inflation, as the Policy Board members think deflation is bad. The annual change in the Consumer Price Index has been above 2 percent for more than two years, but economic growth has been weak in real terms. Targeting higher inflation is a bad policy; they should focus on real growth.Hiroshi UtsumiOgaki, Gifu, JapanEvery time I go into a supermarket, my visceral first thought is, “When will this inflation end so prices can go back to normal?” Mind you, that’s after having taught macroeconomics for 40 years, so I know that inflation is the change in prices, not their level. My second thought is, “Well, you flunked again.”Brent KignerKufstein, AustriaI was surprised that you did not mention the unwinding of the negative supply shock as a reason for the reduction in inflation without an increase in unemployment. Indeed, most news reports that I read solely focus on the Fed, assuming that it alone is responsible for the decreased inflation, when actually I think it has played a secondary role thus far.However, the things that have limited the Fed’s effect on aggregate demand (and, hence on inflation and unemployment), such as an aggregate wealth effect from financial markets, increased real wages and residual effects from the expansion of government programs, have a limited shelf life. And soon, I fear, the Fed increases to date will start to really bite. I believe they are making a big mistake not lowering rates sooner rather than later.One other point. As someone who was a Federal Reserve economist during the Volcker years, I think that the current Federal Open Market Committee has taken the wrong message from those fraught times. They seem to believe that credibility comes from “being tough” on inflation and biasing their decisions toward austerity. That is seriously mistaken. Instead, credibility comes from people believing that the Fed will make the correct decisions at the right time and explain why those decisions were made. I have yet to hear a coherent explanation from the Fed as to why they think they have played a major role in reducing inflation and why they need to keep rates high, other than vague references about the strength of the labor market and actual inflation. Given the lags in policy effects, this is a recipe for disaster. I am afraid this does not end well.Robert DeFinaBala Cynwyd, Pa.I am writing to express my sincere appreciation for your thought-provoking article,“No, Americans Are Not Completely Stupid About Inflation,”in The New York Times. As the rights holder and trustee of the estates of the influential civil rights leaders W.E.B. Du Bois, Shirley Graham Du Bois, and David Graham Du Bois, I was particularly pleased to see you conclude the piece with a powerful quote from W.E.B. Du Bois.Your discussion of the possibility of reducing inflation without inducing a recession through effective coordination and credibility aligns with the forward-thinking approach championed by Du Bois. Moreover, your inclusion of Du Bois’s quote, “Either the United States will destroy ignorance or ignorance will destroy the United States,” serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of education, understanding and open discourse in addressing societal challenges.Odell MurryToluca Lake, Calif.Regarding your newsletter on Red Lobster: Please tell the whole story about the role of private equity in taking apart the business.
