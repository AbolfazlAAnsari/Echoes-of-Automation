Why does this matter?When we talk about Black history to other people, their questions and curiosity will inspire us to form a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the subject.Finally,access the primary sources.Much of what we learn about history comes filtered from the lens and perspectives of others. This isn't necessarily bad, but primary sources offer us the unmediated tales of the past.Primary sources are the words and actions that come directly from the historical actors themselves. They are speeches, sermons, songs, letters, memos and eyewitness testimonies from the people who were actually there.Documentary histories such as \"Eyes on the Prize,\" \"African American Voices: A Documentary Readerfrom Emancipation to the Present\" and \"African American Religious History: A Documentary Witness,\" collect dozens of primary sources in a single volume.While we can always learn from others, there is no replacing looking at the words and actions of history for yourself.Black History Month serves as an annual cultural tradition where we get to focus on the people and events that often go overlooked and under-appreciated.Rather than sharing a few posts on social media or reading a few articles online, we can get the most out of Black History Month by recognizing history as a continuous, dramatic story and not just a set of disconnected dates.Opinion by Jemar TisbyTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
