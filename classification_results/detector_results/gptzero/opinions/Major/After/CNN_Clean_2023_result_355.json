Christie scored thelowest approval ratingof any New Jersey governor in recorded history in June 2017 (15% approval among the state's voters), a Quinnipiac University poll found. Christie at that point couldn't catch a break. Days after leaving office,he even was deniedentry to a special entrance at Newark Liberty International Airport that he once enjoyed as governor.Now Christie is betting hisblustery personalitythattwice won over votersin blue New Jersey will appeal to GOP primary voters. And, taking Christie at his word, he'll deliver a direct confrontation with Trump in a way that never happened during the17-candidate primary mashupin 2016. Back then, Trump rivals such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rubio effectively pulled their punches against Trump early on, before turning on each other and providing a clear path for the billionaire businessman and celebrity television show host to claim the GOP nomination.Christie's position as the leading 2024 anti-Trump Republican is a remarkable turn of events, given thathis endorsement of Trumpin 2016 gave the rookie candidate an imprimatur of GOP establishment legitimacy. Trump didn't do much to return the favor,dropping Christieas director of his presidential transition team after the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the general election. Still, Christie continued to defend Trump in public.Buthe renounced his supportfor Trump after supporters of the defeated president stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.Now, he promises he'll go after Trump directly.\"You'd better have somebody on that stage who can do to (Trump) what I did to Marco (Rubio) because that's the only thing that's going to defeat Donald Trump,\"Christie saidat a New Hampshire town hall event in March.After Trump's May 10CNN town hall,Christie calledthe former president a \"coward\" and a \"puppet of (Vladimir) Putin\" for refusing to take a clear side in Russia's war of aggression against neighboring Ukraine.Christie's chances of wresting the GOP nomination from Trump also rest on hopes that there's an appetite among primary voters for some measure of bipartisanship. That has long been part of the former governor's public persona, balanced with the confrontational sound bites that made him famous. In October 2012,Christie alienated many Republicansby warmly welcoming then-President Barack Obama to New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy.Christie can also point tobipartisan accomplishmentsas New Jersey governor despite facing Democratic majorities in both legislative chambers. These included a reorganization of New Jersey'shigher education system, anexpansion of Medicaidunder the Affordable Care Act andpension overhaul.Christie flamed out in New Hampshire the last time, but there's reason to think a more bipartisan image could resonate in 2024 in the Granite State, which is politically split. The state has aRepublican governor, a nearlyevenly dividedlegislature anda Democratic congressional delegation. And it doesn't hurt thatNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununutold CNN on Monday that he won't seek the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, so Christie won't have to compete against a popular home-state contender who's also a frequent Trump critic.Despite the odds, Christie has one thing going for him - he's the most distinctive non-Trump candidate in the field. And he is unafraid of going after Trump directly, which is necessary to have any hope of blocking the former president's comeback bid.Opinion by David MarkTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
