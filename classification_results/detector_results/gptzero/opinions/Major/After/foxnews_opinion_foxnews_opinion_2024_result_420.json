Eggs cost nearly twice as much, chicken prices have gone up over 25% and bread is 30% more expensive.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONDemocrats in Washington drove our economy off the rails, making sound stewardship in Little Rock even more important. I’m proud that in my first 18 months in office, we slowed the growth of government spending to only 1.76% — below the 3% annual growth we’ve averaged in recent years — and passed those savings along to taxpayers. Our state income tax is now only 3.9%, and our state corporate income tax is only 4.3%. With extra money in their pockets, Arkansans have more ability to cover the higher cost of everyday items.Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders talks about tax cut bills while flanked by state Sen. Jonathan Dismang, left, R-Beebe, Speaker of the House Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado, rear center, and state Sen. Steve Crowell, R-Magnolia, during a news conference at the state Capitol in Little Rock, Arkansas, on Wednesday.(Thomas Metthe/Arkansas Democrat-Gazette via AP)Our state borders Tennessee and Texas — zero income tax states — and hemorrhaged families and businesses to those competitors. Today, the reverse is true: of the Southern states that levy an income tax, Arkansas has the lowest.Now that we’re competing on a level playing field, businesses and people are flocking to our state. Mississippi County, Arkansas, is now the top steel-producing county in America, Camden, Arkansas, is home to expanded facilities for defense companies like Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, and Walmart — the largest company in the world — is putting the finishing touches on its new and expanded headquarters in Bentonville.Last week, I joined business owners in Central Arkansas to celebrate two expansions that invested more than $330 million and will pave the way for more than 900 jobs. In total, my administration collaborated with companies to secure more than $1 billion in investment last year.Polls show that Americans are fed up with Democrats in Washington. Afterthree years of economic failure, that’s not surprising. The good news is there’s another option: fiscal responsibility, smaller government and lower taxes. It’s working in Arkansas. It’s working in other Republican-led states. And if it’s put in place in Washington, it will revive our national economy.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GOV.
