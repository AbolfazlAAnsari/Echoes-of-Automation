While President Joe Biden and the Senate use support for Israel as a pawn to secure more funding for Ukraine and other domestic programs, House Republicans must make clear that this is no time for games.Finally, Johnson must treat the weaponization of government agencies, including the Department of Defense, Department of Justice and IRS, as the grave threat to our republic that it is.If the House doesn’t act, no one in Washington will. Because of their ability to conduct oversight hearings, investigate wrongdoing and subpoena witnesses, the spotlight is on members of the House to deliver. That starts with the speaker making the fundamental principles of fairness, objectivity, transparency, and accountability a central priority.Tackling these issues won’t be a cakewalk. The pursuit of these goals will require the full array of tools at the speaker’s disposal: Instructing members to use the appropriations process to make funding decisions, refusing to kowtow to the Senate by taking a harder line with assertive negotiations and empowering committee chairmen to provide critical oversight of the unelected bureaucracy.But it's not impossible. The Heritage Foundation is committed to working with Speaker Johnson and our congressional allies to secure conservative wins for the American people. With an unwavering commitment and unifying leadership, congressional Republicans can restore American leadership abroad and deliver for the American people at home.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM KEVIN ROBERTSDr. Kevin Roberts is president of the Heritage Foundation.
