But I don’t drive several Bugattis or have millions in the bank and, apparently, that is what makes you a world authority on just about every subject.AnonymousAddress SuppliedThe Brexit we have today was not chosen by the publicIn responseto Steven Mackinder’s letter, you can argue that the result of Brexit was democratic but the approach then taken by successive governments was not. There has been a continued effort to create an ever-harder Brexit, purging anything evenclosely associated with Europeand erecting barriers. There has been no attempt at compromise, no recognition that the vote wasn’t won by an overwhelming majority (52/48 is close), and no real attempt to engage with those of us who support European integration and enjoyed the freedoms our citizenship brought.It is true that the world economic situation is causing problems across Europe too. However, the impact on the UK is harder, deeper and looksto last a lot longer.Brexit is to blame. The Brexit we have now, the one the government chose, is the result of giving voice to the mostextreme anti-European viewsin the Tory party.David NewshamStirlingWe can’t blame lockdown for children’s healthSome experts have claimed that past lockdowns have harmed children’s developing immune systems – that a lack of pathogens encountered during those few weeks away from the school environment has led to enhancedvulnerability to many other diseases.In light of this knowledge, surely it is now crucial to campaign to abolish the annual seven-week summer vacation?During this time, large numbers of children do not have the opportunity to gather together in unventilated classrooms with up to 40 closely packed children and hence are denied the opportunity of being exposed to pathogen-laden air. If these experts are correct, this will surely lead to impaired immune function for years to come. To protect our children, we urgently need to do something about this. The obvious step is to abolish the long summer holiday and keep children in school at all times.Dr N BoydBarnard Castle, DurhamMaking a difference to animal welfare has never been more importantLaying hen farmers across much of the UK have had to bring their birds indoors due to bird flu in order to stop the spread of the disease. This has been one ofthe worst outbreaks of avian influenza(AI) the UK has ever seen, with sadly many birds becoming ill and dying. A nationwide housing order has now been imposed,with egg shortages leadingto imported eggs on supermarket shelves from potentially lower-welfare farms.As a food campaigner and journalist for many years, I’m concerned about the impact bringing birds indoors has on their welfare. A recent poll, carried out byRSPCAAssured – the RSPCA’s ethical food label and farm assurance scheme – found that a whopping 87 per cent of people care about hen welfare and believe they should be given enrichment whilst housed indoors, so I’m clearly not alone. Just over half of the public also said they wouldn’t eat eggs that had come from caged hens.With Pancake Day just around the corner, I want to help remind people that it’s very easy to make abig difference to the welfare of hensby only choosing eggs with a higher welfare label such as RSPCA Assured.Kate QuiltonBroadcaster and RSPCA campaignerWhy would Lancashire Police issue a statement on Nicola Bulley’s personal history?What relevance would this have to their investigation into her disappearance? Given the rampantspeculation there alreadyis on this, it seems unhelpful to me that the police should choose to release essentiallyprivate informationabout a person who may still be alive.And in the context of an apparent dispute between thespecialist water search expertsand the police over whether she fell in the river, this doesn’t in my view cast the police in a good light. That, by extension, furthercalls into questionthe quality of the police investigation. Not to mention how upsetting it will be to her loved ones that this has been released.Ian HendersonNorwich"
