Her Oxford University Press book \"Outsiders No More: Models of Immigrant Political Incorporation\" has four co-authors. It is easy to wonder whether, were her work not to focus mainly on the politics of race and gender, she would get tenure in a serious university government department.Of course, she has to know this. Yet, who would want such non-merit based \"qualifications\" to be the basis of one’s career? Privately, she must understand that her accomplishments are minimal. She must understand, as well, that absent identity politics, she could well have been cashiered like Penn President Liz Magill.CAMPUS ANTISEMITISM HAS PARENTS, STUDENTS RECONSIDERING COLLEGE CHOICESMore broadly, this is the central problem withrace-based affirmative action. Not what it denies Whites or Asians, but what it denies its supposed beneficiaries: honest criticism, advancement or failure based on accomplishment or its lack. In other words, agency with all its complications, as my American Enterprise Institute colleague Ian Rowe likes to emphasize.Psychologists have actually diagnosed the damage of what they call \"imposter syndrome\" – the fear that one does not deserve one’s professional success. As I’ve noted in City Journal, the website called DiversityInc warns that this syndrome, can \"take a heavy toll on people of color, particularly African-Americans.\"Harvard President Claudine Gay attends a menorah lighting ceremony on Dec. 13, 2023, in Harvard Yard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.(Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty Images)A paper from the Center for Community Solutions examines \"the devaluation of oneself: dealing with imposter syndrome in the Black community.\" A Maryville University paper explores \"Imposter syndrome from a Black perspective.\"ANTISEMITISM IS A HORRIBLE EVIL THAT WE MUST FIGHTPerhapsmost relevant for President Gayis a Harvard Business Review essay that focuses on imposter syndrome as it affects Black women.In Gay’s case, the situation is even more complicated. She has risen at least in part on the basis of a program meant to correct for disadvantage – when she herself is the daughter of Haitian immigrant professionals (her father an engineer, her mother a nurse) and she attended Exeter, Princeton and Stanford.It’s useful to compare her situation to that of one of her leading Harvard critics, former university President Lawrence Summers. There was little, if any, mention at the time of his appointment that he was the first Jewish president of Harvard, a school which had infamously set quotas on the number of Jewish students in the 1920s. (His predecessor Neil Rudenstine had Jewish roots but was raised as a Catholic.)CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONCertainly his Jewishness offered him no protection when he was forced to resign in the wake of his raising the question whether there might be fewer women in STEM fields because of genetic predisposition. An uncomfortable question, to be sure, but certainly not one that should be out of bounds for academic research. The answer, after all, could be no.But in contrast to Gay, Summers was, in a way, lucky: he was afforded the benefit of honest, albeit misguided, criticism. He rose, and fell, on what were viewed as his merits.Perhaps there is, indeed, something inClaudine Gay’s leadership qualitythat merits her not being dismissed for reasons that would likely have sunk someone without the protection of identity politics. If so, she can take comfort in knowing that.More likely, however, in the privacy of her own thoughts, she knows that’s not why she’s been kept on – and must suffer the self-doubt that brings with it. So, yes, I feel sorry for her.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM HOWARD HUSOCKHoward Husock is the author of \"The Poor Side of Town: And Why We Need It\" (Encounter Books). He is a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
