But this time, the desperate Trump wants his supporters to protect him from being held accountable for potential crimes.This scenario seems to have played out afterthe FBI's August 8 searchof Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in the investigation of handling classified documents followinga court-approved warrant. Trump released a statement shortly afterward thatread in part, \"These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,\" slamming what he called the \"political persecution.\" Two days later hebaselessly accusedthe FBI of potentiallyplanting evidence.It is not surprising that the FBI was soon subject to an \"unprecedented\" number of threats against bureau personnel and property. One person - who had in the pastrepeated the false 2020 election claimson Trump's social media platform - tried to breach an FBI field office in Cincinnati and was killed ina shootout with police.The former president alsohas repeatedly floated pardoningthe January 6 attackers should he be reelected - even claiming they deserve an \"apology.\" Trump's message is clear: I will have your back if I can get back in the White House.It's reassuring to see that Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney,told his staff by emailSaturday night, \"We do not tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law in New York.\" While not mentioning Trump by name,he added, \"Our law enforcement partners will ensure that any specific or credible threats against the office will be fully investigated and that the proper safeguards are in place so all 1,600 of us have a secure work environment.\"This email sounds like something you would hear from a prosecutor in a case involving a terrorist leader or mob boss. But that is where we are as a nation given what has happened in the past few years.If the facts and the law warrant criminal charges, Trump should face an indictment, just as any of us would. And if there is an incitement of violence, criminal charges should also be brought in that regard. No one is above the law - not even Donald J.
