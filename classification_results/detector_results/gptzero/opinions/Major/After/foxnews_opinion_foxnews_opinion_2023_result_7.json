Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.\"George Orwell's \"1984\" is getting a society-wide reboot in 2023 from leftist censors.(Getty Images/Bettmann / Contributor)Back to our present here in 2023, while not every record has been destroyed, not every book rewritten, not every statue, street, and building renamed, nor every date altered, the far-left woke-army is picking off more and more with each passing day.Roald Dahl’s beloved children’s books such as \"Matilda,\" \"James and the Giant Peach,\" and \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" being but the latest examples.As was reported, Puffin, the publisher of Dahl's classic works, has hired \"sensitivity readers\" to make changes to certain portions of the author's wording in the U.K. editions. And by \"changes,\" they mean the inclusion of \"gender neutral\" language; the exclusion of words their \"sensitivity readers\" deem offensive; and the outright altering of the author’s intent.As Dahl passed away over 30 years ago, this alarming censorship of his work brings an entirely new meaning to the words: \"ghost written.\"Now, in \"James and the Giant Peach,\" the character of Miss Sponge is no longer described as \"the fat one,\" Miss Spider’s head is not \"black\" anymore, and the Earthworm has given up its \"lovely pink\" skin for \"lovely smooth skin.\"Staying with that classic book, Dahl’s \"Cloud-Men\" are now \"Cloud-People.\"  Likewise, the Oompa Loompas in \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" described by Dahl as \"small men,\" are now known in the rewritten books as \"small people.\"Interestingly – but not surprisingly – enough, in \"Matilda,\" the \"eight nutty little idiots\" was changed to \"eight nutty little boys.\" Apparently, the \"sensitivity readers\" used by the publisher had no problem replacing the word \"idiots\" with \"boys.\"In defending what many to most will clearly view as \"identity politics\" woke-censorship, the Roald Dahl Story rationalized in part:As was reported, Puffin, the publisher of Dahl's classic works, has hired \"sensitivity readers\" to make changes to certain portions of the author's wording in the U.K. editions. And by \"changes,\" they mean the inclusion of \"gender neutral\" language; the exclusion of words their \"sensitivity readers\" deem offensive; and the outright altering of the author’s intent.\"The current review began in 2020, before Dahl was acquired by Netflix. It was led by Puffin and Roald Dahl Story Company together. The current review began in 2020, before Dahl was acquired by Netflix.
