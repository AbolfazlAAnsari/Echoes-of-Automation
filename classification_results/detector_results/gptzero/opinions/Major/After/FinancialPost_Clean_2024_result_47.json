            "inputText": "By John LesterIn its nine years in office the federal Liberal government has lavished spending on business, boosting annual subsidies from $17 billion to $40 billion this year, headed for $50 billion in 2027-28 - almost three times higher, compared to \"just\" a doubling of overall program spending. In 2027-28, business subsidies will represent 54 per cent of corporate income tax revenue, up from 42 per cent in 2014-15.What are taxpayers getting in return for all this largesse? The favoured sectors and activities have certainly expanded, but Canadians likely are poorer, not richer, as a result. Subsidies can only improve overall well-being if two things are true: markets aren't allocating society's scarce resources as efficiently as possible and subsidies improve this allocation.Typically, market failure occurs when prices don't fully capture the social costs and benefits of economic activity. For example, when firms perform R&;D some of the knowledge created inevitably spills over to other firms, who benefit from the R&;D without having performed it themselves. When deciding on how much to spend on R&;D, firms don't consider these spillover benefits, so from society's perspective, R&;D spending is too low.Or there's a negative spillover from, say, greenhouse gas emissions. The market price of fossil fuels doesn't capture the cost to the climate when burning them releases CO2 into the atmosphere. The best way to deal with this negative spillover is to put a price on carbon emissions, though there may also be sound reasons to use subsidies to raise the effectiveness of carbon pricing.The federal government can credibly claim that programs accounting for 65 per cent of business subsidies do address a market failure and therefore have at least the potential to raise real income. The remaining 35 per cent do not, however, and therefore are simply transfers from one set of Canadians to another, creating economic costs with no offsetting benefits.But because all subsidies involve costs there is no guarantee that even among the 65 per cent of possibly worthwhile subsidies there will actually be a net social benefit from correcting a market failure. In a new study(https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FP6-FedBusSubsidies.Lester.Mar7_.pdf), I present evidence that most of the 65 per cent of subsides that do aim at correcting market failures in fact fail a cost-benefit test.For example, the Business Development Bank makes loans to higher-risk borrowers who have been priced out of the private banking sector. These loans are provided on terms that more accurately reflect their risk, so they do raise real incomes. But the benefit generated is less than the social cost of providing the loans - which is equal to the true opportunity cost of the federal funding less BDC's gross financial return on its lending operations. By my calculations, that's 8.3 per cent minus 2.6 per cent, for a social cost of federal funding equal to 5.7 per cent. That's substantially greater than the 1.5 per cent return generated by the high-risk loans. Lending money that costs you 5.7 per cent in order to earn an all-in return of 1.5 per cent is not a good use of resources.Other notable subsidies that fail to pass cost-benefit tests are: the preferential income tax rate for small business; the enhanced SR&;ED tax credit; and the Industrial Research Assistance Program. In contrast, the benefits of the regular SR&;ED tax credit are 1.6 times its costs so it passes with flying colours.In total, the programs that do plausibly address a market failure but fail a benefit-cost test account for about 45 per cent of business subsidies this fiscal year. As mentioned, another 35 per cent cannot credibly claim to be addressing a market failure, which means they simply move money around among Canadians, which shrinks the economic pie. The total share of subsidies having a negative impact on the economy is therefore 80 per cent.What's to be done? We should look at these programs that do address a market failure but don't pass a cost-benefit test to see if they can be restructured to generate net benefits. If not, they should be eliminated. Programs that can't even pretend to correct a market failure should be examined to see if their income distribution effects can be justified given the economic costs they impose. Key subsidies in this category are: the Employee Stock Option Deduction; the Regional Economic Growth through Innovation program; various agricultural income stabilization measures; the Dairy Direct Payment Program; and the Labour-Sponsored Venture Capital Corporation credit.Most of the projected increase in federal subsidies over the next four years arises from clean-economy programs and measures to \"create good jobs.\" The clean-economy measures should be evaluated in two steps. First, determine if they fill gaps in the carbon pricing regime or address a market problem, such as inadequate investment in electric vehicle charging stations, that could impede the effectiveness of carbon pricing. Then evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of any that do, which would identify programs that could be fine-tuned or eliminated.The government should be particularly cautious about using subsidies to \"create good jobs\" until it can be demonstrated that they actually do improve economic performance. These programs will alter the structure of the Canadian economy, but possibly at greater cost than benefit. Take the subsidy for foreign companies to shoot films in Canada. It has expanded the film production sector, which pays relatively high wages. Even so, Canadians are poorer as a result: the subsidy is shared with foreign producers, and the wage premium is not large enough to offset the cost of financing the program with higher taxes.Hands off my pension!

Reading Friedman is much better(https://financialpost.com/opinion/milton-friedman-app-isnt-bad-reading-friedman-much-better)Restructuring or eliminating ineffective business subsidies could easily save $25 billion a year by 2027-28. Using these savings to pay down the debt or cut corporate income taxes would make Canadians richer.John Lester is an executive fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy.Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the business news you need to know - add financialpost.com(https://financialpost.com/ ) to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here(https://financialpost.com/newsletters/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2024 Postmedia Network Inc.
