            "inputText": "By Matt Strauss, Marta Shaw, J. Edward Les and Pooya KazemiMark Twain once said, via the inimitable Tom Sawyer, \"Right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and knows better.\"That's a sentiment we can all get behind. But it's a tough standard to meet when we're relatively ignorant and we don't know better.Such was the case in the early weeks and months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when uncertainty - and the high anxiety engendered by that uncertainty - ruled the day.The COVID saga unspooled amidst a sea of unknowns; yet public health officials, governments and news media appointed themselves as unassailable arbiters of COVID \"truth\" and reacted with hostility to ideas and opinions that challenged their narratives. Reasonable dissenters to delivered orthodoxies on lockdowns, masking or vaccine boosters were censored, ridiculed and shamed as purveyors of \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation\" - terms that were and continue to be distorted and weaponized to silence critics and muzzle scientific debate(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-misuse-of-the-term-misinformation-has-muzzled-scientific-covid-19-debate). This resulted in policy errors, and, sadly, in a serious erosion of public trust in institutional leaders.This is not to say that all perspectives are equal, or that the online world was not littered with actual misinformation. Claiming that COVID-19 was not real or serious was misinformation. Suggesting that fresh and fitted high-quality masks do not work in controlled clinical settings was misinformation. Asserting that COVID-19 vaccines did not reduce severe disease was misinformation. And insisting that there was high-quality evidence for the efficacy of ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 was misinformation.Matt Strauss: Left-wing Toronto media got it wrong about me and the pandemic(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/matt-strauss-left-wing-toronto-media-got-it-wrong-about-me-and-the-pandemic)Opinion: Beware misinformation about COVID risks to kids(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-beware-misinformation-about-covid-risks-to-kids)But we shouldn't fight misinformation with censorship, propaganda, and paternalism - nor, dare we say, with our own misinformation. We should fight it by providing better information; by providing nuance, balance and context; by being transparent and honest; by treating people with respect and meeting them where they are; and by hewing to traditional, time-tested principles of public health.Misinformation, to be clear, isn't \"missed-information\"; information that was overlooked because of ignorance, bias, and political or ideological motivations. Oxford's online dictionary defines misinformation as \"false or inaccurate information, especially that which is deliberately intended to deceive.\" (The back half of that definition applies to \"disinformation,\" misinformation's more sinister cousin.)That seems straightforward enough; but anyone who is familiar with the area of epistemology (the theory of knowledge) can tell you that truth - perhaps especially medical truth - can be difficult to approximate. In fact, physician-scientist Dr. John Ioannidis, a huge name in evidence-based medicine and one of the most highly cited scientists in the world, has argued convincingly that \"most published research findings are false\"(https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) (yes, this is the same Dr. Ioannidis who was relentlessly smeared and slandered for daring to offer a dissenting perspective to the initial, panicked COVID response.) Dr. Ioannidis' premise is echoed by a recent paper(https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2203150119)in which 73 independent research teams were given identical data to determine whether a social intervention resulted in a particular outcome: stunningly, the 73 research teams came to wildly differing results, ranging from largely positive to largely negative.As the purveyor of the worst pandemic in a century, COVID-19 brought a dizzying mix of disarray, panic, and toxic politics. Amidst the confusion, institutional leaders shed epistemic humility and claimed certainty where none existed. Rather than being presented with humble, transparent and thoughtful debate, however, we were subjected to manufactured consensus, ideological narratives, and suppression of dissent.Consider the mask debacle(https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/science/articles/the-mask-debacle). Initially(https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/the-coronavirus-question-to-mask-or-not-to-mask/) we were told that community masking was ineffective and unnecessary. But for reasons that remain unclear, there was a sudden and dramatic about-face in policy, and masks were not only recommended but mandated; and those skeptical of the new community masking policy were vilified as \"anti-maskers.\" This even though in the pre-2020 world there was general agreement that community masking of healthy people was ineffective: the 2018 Canadian pandemic influenza preparedness guidelines(https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/flu-influenza/canadian-pandemic-influenza-preparedness-planning-guidance-health-sector/public-health-measures.html)stated that community masks \"may not be an appropriate use of public resources, since little evidence exists regarding their effectiveness in reducing the spread of disease in the general population.\"No new high-quality evidence emerged to refute this consensus on community masking; yet during the past three years we were repeatedly assured that community masking was \"highly effective.\" In an article(https://dialogue.cpso.on.ca/2021/06/rise-of-infodemics/?print=print) about mis- and disinformation, which featured the oft-quoted Canadian misinformation expert Timothy Caulfield, mask skepticism was referred to as a \"fringe idea.\"With respect, we're curious as to Caufield's thoughts on the just published 2023 review on masking from Cochrane(https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub6/full#CD006207-sec-0216) (one of the most trusted organizations for evidence-based medicine in the world), which concluded that \"wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness (ILI)/COVID-19 like illness\"; or on the only three COVID-era randomized controlled trials on masking (from Bangladesh(https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi9069), Denmark(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33205991/ ) and Guinea Bissau(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4307646)), each of which was either negative or very underwhelming; or on the conclusion(https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/commentary-what-can-masks-do-part-2-what-makes-good-mask-study-and-why-most-fail) of world-famous epidemiologist Dr. Michael Osterholm and his colleagues that masks have a \"very minor role to play in preventing person-to-person transmission\"; or on the studies from around the world that have shown no meaningful benefit(https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(22)00549-7/fulltext) to masking children.Our critique goes well beyond masking. Reputable scientists and physicians have questioned - and in many cases debunked - the \"official\" narratives on lockdowns(https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eci.13484), school closures(https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n521), border testing(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-why-are-we-still-talking-about-travel-restrictions-for-covid-19/), vaccine mandates(https://gh.bmj.com/content/7/5/e008684), endless boosters(https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2206573), bivalent COVID shots(https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2215780), epidemic forecasting(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32863495/ ), natural immunity(https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02465-5/fulltext), vaccine-induced myocarditis(https://www.science.org/content/article/heart-risks-data-gaps-fuel-debate-covid-19-boosters-young-people?fbclid=IwAR0mm6mXenbk-id84Igcl5Bt_Qe-f0XOju2F2fGj0vW8H-AT3PR3ndSzs4M), and more. Much of this criticism was initially ignored or labelled as misinformation. But it's become untenable for those in charge to defend many of their initial positions.Take, for instance, the concept of \"natural immunity.\" A recent systematic review and meta-analysis published in The Lancet(https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02465-5/fulltext) demonstrated that the \"level of protection afforded by previous infection is at least as high, if not higher than that provided by two-dose vaccination using high-quality mRNA vaccines.\" Against severe disease, natural immunity is real, robust and durable - just as some had correctly claimed much earlier(https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/09/15/natural-immunity-vaccine-mandate/).Our understanding of COVID-related issues has evolved greatly. We've seen that models and mannequins don't adequately represent the real world. It's imperative that we recognize our errors and leverage the lessons learned into better preparedness for the next pandemic.This is a time to heal and come together; but that will require honesty, humility, and the willingness to admit to those errors.News media's tendency to peddle hyperbole and hysterics is perhaps understandable - that's what sells. And we can't rely on political leaders to have our best interests at heart, given their fondness for power and their perpetual eye on the next election.But the medical profession can claim no such excuses: as doctors we're expected to lead with knowledge, integrity, empathy and humility.Our profession has an extraordinarily hard time with humility. We have a tough time owning up to mistakes. Recently, we even seem to struggle to acknowledge how vital debate and disagreement are to the evolution of medical practice and the advancement of science. It's true that throughout the pandemic we've had, in the main, the best interests of our patients and the public at heart; but it's also true that we made many, many missteps - and for that we owe the public a genuine mea culpa.Apology, to turn a phrase, is a dish best served warm. It's far too late for that: the best time for an apology was many months ago.But the next best time - as we're sure Tom Sawyer would agree - is today.Special to National PostMatt Strauss is a critical care physician and acting medical officer of health for Haldimand-Norfolk.
