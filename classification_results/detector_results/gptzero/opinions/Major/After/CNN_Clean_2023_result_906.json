After we helped evacuate their wounded and dead, my Marines and I assaulted the building with a platoon of Recon Marines in support.But with insurgents throwing grenades from the roof and rolling them down the stairs, we took casualties ourselves, and I made the difficult decision to withdraw my platoon - and call in an air strike to level the building.It was the right decision to kill insurgents without losing more Marines, but leveling a school doesn't win you a lot of hearts and minds.
