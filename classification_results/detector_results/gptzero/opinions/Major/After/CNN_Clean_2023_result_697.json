Readmore opinionat CNN.A Fox News pollreleasedlast week found that 52% of Americans don't believe that 77-year-old Donald Trump has the \"mental soundness to serve\" as president. That same poll showed that61% of Americanshave the same concern about President Joe Biden, who is 80. But while there is extensive media coverage aboutBiden's ageandgaffes, Trump, for themost part,gets a pass.For example, ata September 8 rallyin South Dakota, the 2024 GOP presidential front-runner abruptly stopped mid-speech for40 secondsas he awkwardly looked at the audience, his eyes darting around. Some ofhis supportersonline asserted that Trump - who had just said the United States was \"the greatest nation in the history of the world\" - wasovercome with emotion. Have you ever seen Trump overcome with emotion? It's hard for me to buy that explanation.Regardless of the reason for the pause, imagine if Biden had abruptly stopped a speech midway through and began looking around the audience for more than half a minute? Much of the media - and I don't mean just right-wing outlets - would likely ask if Biden had become confused or had fallen ill, or if the teleprompter stopped working and he wasn't mentally able to fill the time? Such a clip of Biden would probably be played nonstop on cable news and dissected by pundits and even doctors specializing in cognitive issues.But with Trump, there was no notice, although Frank Bruni took note of his lapses into incoherence in a New York Times column last week with the headline \"Trump Is Really Old, Too.\"Then there was Trump's gaffe-filledspeechFriday at the Washington, DC, Pray Vote Stand Summit that some observers dubbed a \"word salad.\" But that framing is not close to what happened. Trump - who faces91 felony chargesin four criminal cases- confusingly invoked former President Barack Obama's name twice and apparently forgot World War II had already happened.After calling Biden \"cognitively impaired\" (talk about irony!), Trump claimed the president was leading us into World War II. Of course, that global conflict ended in 1945, a year beforeTrump was born.Trump then mistakenlyreferred toObama in two instances. First Trump declared, \"As you know, crooked Joe Biden and the radical left thugs have weaponized law enforcement to arrest their leading political opponent, and leading by a lot, including Obama - I'll tell you what.\" Obviously, Obama is not running for president in 2024.Trump laterstated, \"With Obama, we won an election that everyone said couldn't be won.\" Apparently realizing his mistake, Trump then quickly said, \"Hillary Clinton,\" who was his opponent in 2016.Again, if Biden had made those types of mistakes, many in the media likely would have covered them as part of the narrative that the octogenarian president lacks the mental soundness to do the job for another four years.Besides these mistakes, there's another issue unique to Trump, which demands more attention. It's his assertion that he won the 2020 election. Sure, he could just be claiming he won so his base will not view him as a loser, but there is a good faith question that needs to be explored of whether such a claim is delusional.Just last month, Trumpagain saidhe won Georgia in 2020 despitethat being patently false. Trumpcontinuesto make the same claim for the overall 2020 results despite his own officials after the election - including then-Attorney General William Barr - informing him there wasno evidenceto support his bogus assertions. And the former president must know his60-plus election challengesin court all failed, including in cases before Trump-appointed judges.Further undermining Trump's claims he won in 2020 is somethinghe mentioned in his speech Fridayin Washington, and that is polling. Trump is now touting polls that he's leading Biden. (In reality, the two are locked in a tight race within themargin of errorin a hypothetical matchup.) Well, the polls in the weeks before the 2020 election showed Bidenwinningby an average of 10 points. AFox News pollreleased just days before the 2020 election had Biden up by 8 percentage points. If Trump had been up by that margin and then lost in 2020, perhaps it would have bolstered his claims of election wrongdoing. Instead, the polls predicted Biden would win - and he did.Trump's gaffes may simply be mistakes. But his continued false claims that he won the 2020 election warn us that he is either one of the most committed liars we've ever seen or his views are delusional. In either case, for the sake of our nation, Trump can never again be trusted to be the commander in chief.Opinion by Dean Obeidallah, CNNTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
