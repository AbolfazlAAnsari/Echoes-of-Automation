The film portrays the horrific racism and hatred the 6-year-old Ruby experienced each day from an angry mob of White men, women and children, as she entered her school.In a poignant scene where the parents are debating whether to keep Ruby in the school, the camera turns to Sallman’s portrait of Jesus hanging on the wall. When the mother seeks time to pray to God about their decision, the father holds up Sallman’s work and declares, \"She’s got it in her head that White folks are better than colored.\"Even though Christians recognize Jesus as Immanuel (which means, God with us), the Gospel writers never describe his physical appearance. Furthermore, while unbiblical images of Jesus as a baby may be a stumbling block to some, I have found the depictions of him as an adult to be much more problematic.\"What’s that got to do with Jesus?\", the mother asks.\"Ain’t nobody really knows what He looks like,\" the father responds. \"But when she sees this every day, that tells her God looks more like them White folks outside her school than her.\"Thankfully, with the help of her parents, Ruby is given a biblical view of Jesus. Her deep faith in Jesus sustains her and allows her to persevere through the horrible treatment she receives from her community — praying for her verbal attackers every day and echoing Jesus’ prayer on the cross, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.As I seek God’s forgiveness for the times I have not represented His image or that of His Son through my actions, I am reminded of the powerful charge St. Paul gave to the Church of Corinth: \"And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another.\"For the power of Jesus transforms us, bringing forgiveness of sin and restoring us back to His original intent of reflecting His image.
