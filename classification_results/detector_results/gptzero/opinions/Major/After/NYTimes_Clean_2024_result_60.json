That hypothetical scenario is based on extensive scientific research and effect modeling from the Cold War to the present, as well as conversations with experts, government officials and survivors of nuclear detonations. We have compiled a selection of those sources — detailing the humanitarian, environmental and economic effects — to help make this research more easily available to readers.Accounts of Living Through the BombThe scenario describing the effects of a nuclear detonation in the article draws on several interviews with hibakusha, survivors of the atomic bombs, conducted in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in October 2023. It also draws on key written accounts of the devastation of the two cities.“I.C.R.C.

Quartet Books, 1981.Nuclear Explosion SimulatorTo calculate the death toll and range of the effects from an atomic detonation, we consulted Alex Wellerstein’sNukemap, which draws on models published by the U.S. government during the Cold War to visualize the effects of a nuclear attack.Understanding the Impact of Nuclear WeaponsThere is a long history of academic study on the known effects of nuclear weapons in Japan and from testing around the world, as well as modeling and research conducted to anticipate the physical, economic and medical devastation of nuclear weapons.
