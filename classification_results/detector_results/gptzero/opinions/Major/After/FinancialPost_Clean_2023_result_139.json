But we also need land where we can create, innovate and build things.Over the past two decades,Ontario has lost more than 169 manufacturing facilities(https://trilliummfg.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ontarios-Industrial-Land-Shortage_Interactive_FINAL.pdf), according to the Trillium Network for Advanced Manufacturing. In most cases, these manufacturers were on land that was later converted to residential or retail use. Those \"employment lands\" (as they are known) aren't available any longer to generate wealth, property taxes or jobs in their communities.But we really need new housing because our urban populations are growing fast and there's already a shortage, right? That's true, but we also need jobs and businesses. And the jobs need to be reasonably close so that communities surrounding them are not just bedroom suburbs but economic drivers.Everyone knows about the housing shortage, but municipalities are facing pent-up demand for employment lands. In my community of Markham, Ont., which straddles Highway 407 north and east of Toronto, the current vacancy rate for industrial space is a tight 1.1 per cent, and that's with more than 500,000 square feet of space either under construction or scheduled for it. Such shortages are common throughout southern Ontario.The health of our cities and our economic prosperity are directly related to how businesses start, grow and adapt. If space for new businesses is not available, opportunities will drift elsewhere and jobs with them.In Markham, rather than struggle with Band-Aid solutions from year to year, we confronted this problem by planning to accommodate job and population growth for the next 25 to 30 years. Working with York Region planning officials, we prepared a long-term plan to make available the right types of land for living and working when they would be needed.The result was a comprehensive land budget that included a future boundary extension to make sure enough land would be available for housing and jobs in areas that were appropriate for both uses. This land budget is based on past and forecast employment data in the GTA, focusing on key sectors such as technology and manufacturing.A major factor in drafting this plan is that Markham and York Region's employment growth has outpaced its population growth, increasing on average 5.8 per cent a year compared to just 4.3 per cent a year for population. The bulk of that employment growth has been in expanding innovative sectors like semiconductors, biotech and creative industries.Given this trend and the demand for serviced employment lands, we recently unveiled Markham Innovation Exchange (MIX). The municipality is contributing 410 acres to a planned 1,920-acre employment-first development in partnership with the private sector along Highway 404 North. That's a dramatic boost to employment lands to help address the current shortage. It sends a message to employers that we're serious about long-term job creation and to residents that there will be a diverse array of jobs here for the future.Like all forecasts, the Markham land budget is also flexible. If the demands for employment land are met earlier than anticipated, the official plan can be amended to rezone designated areas for housing. The goal is to be prepared for growth and to avoid the delays and missteps of playing catch-up.There are many tools other urban areas can use to protect their industrial base, such as retro-fitting, re-zoning or requesting proposals from the private sector. The goal is the same: if we want to protect jobs in our communities, we have to start by protecting and upgrading the places where people work.Cities like Markham, Kitchener-Waterloo and Windsor have successfully established themselves as advanced-tech economy hubs, but the effort took many years and involved intense collaboration carefully targeting specific sectors. Without properly serviced employment lands, all of these achievements are at risk.Terence Corcoran: Metro rips up the grocery cartel theory(https://financialpost.com/opinion/metro-rips-up-grocery-cartel-theory)Philip Cross: Higher inflation risks becoming entrenched(https://financialpost.com/opinion/higher-inflation-entrenched-canada)Opinion: Want more housing? How about taxing builders less?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/more-housing-construction-tax-builders-less)So while more housing does need to be built, and fast, it should go where people want to live and put down roots. For that reason, we also need to protect and enhance land that hosts workplaces, big and small, so that residents see an economic future where they live.Chris Rickett is director of economic growth, culture and entrepreneurship for the City of Markham, Ont. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
