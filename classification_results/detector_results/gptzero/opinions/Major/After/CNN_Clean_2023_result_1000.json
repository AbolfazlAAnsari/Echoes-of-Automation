Gibson acknowledges that bystanders might not always get a straight answer when they check in -  if the person is truly planning an attack, he or she might deflect the questions or lie. But it is important to alert the authorities anyway.When a bystander becomes aware of key information about a potential shooter and does nothing, that individual is16 times more likelyto go on and commit an act of violence, according to a US government assessment. This is because a potential shooter might perceive that silence as permission, the assessment finds.Gibson says people planning attacks are often crying out for attention. \"In the conversations we've had with offenders, they felt like nobody was really paying attention to them,\" she explained.The most important piece of advice Gibson says she can offer to bystanders is to speak up and tell someone they trust about their concerns.A former FBI special agent,Mary O'Toole, a pioneer in the field of threat management, urged family members who might have concerns about a loved one to do their best to limit his or her access to weapons.Ultimately, what makes the US so exceptional when it comes to mass shootings is how pervasive guns are. There aremore guns in the US than people.While stricter gun laws might not completely eradicate shootings, and other forms of violence may still persist, these laws could go a long way in saving lives.Given the political reality in the United States that makes passing stricter gun laws extremely difficult, the next best thing might be to recognize who is on the pathway to violence - and figure how to effectively intervene before that person carries out the next mass shooting.Opinion by Peter Bergen and Laura TillmanTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
