And of course, I did get a few of those.But to my surprise, the response was overwhelmingly positive. Countless women and men thanked me for speaking out. They expressed their anger over the infiltration ofbiological men in female spacesand their concern about the erasure of women's sports in the name of \"inclusion.\"But here's the problem: Many of these messages of support came privately in my DMs or via text message. They are happy that a few people like me are shouldering this fight because they are too afraid — for various reasons — to do it themselves.But the silence has to stop. And earlier this month, we found out why.RILEY GAINES SHREDS BIDEN PROMISE TO VETO BILL PROTECTING WOMEN'S SPORTS: 'CATERING TO A RADICAL MINORITY'FormerUniversity of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaineswas violently assaulted at San Francisco State University. She had arrived on campus to give a speech on protecting women's sports. But instead of civil discourse, she was met with a mob of trans activists whoheld her hostagein a hallway.Then, a grown man in a dressphysically assaulted her.I'm done being nice. Actually, I passed that point a long time ago.I'm p*ssed.And you should be, too.Where are the women?If you had told me a year ago the entire country would be viciously fighting about transgender \"women\" — that it would be the No. 1 issue in the United States today — I would have laughed at you and reminded you thatgas is $6 a gallon.But here we are.RILEY GAINES: I WAS ASSAULTED BY A TRANSGENDER MOB AND THIS IS WHAT I PLAN TO DO NEXTBiological men arehonored on ESPNfor their success in women's sports. A man pretending to be a little girl is showered with millions of dollars incorporate sponsorshipsfor outwardly mocking women. And people like Riley Gaines are physically beaten for simply acknowledging biological reality.So how did we get here? How did we reach this level of insanity?After transgender TikTok starDylan Mulvaneysurpassed $1 million in brand deals by reducing women to cartoonish stereotypes, OutKick founder Clay Travis asked an important question: Why do biological women allow this to happen?\"Is it because women are worried about being nice? Afraid of what other women will say? So obsessed with tolerance that they will allow the erasure of their sex?\" he tweeted.Someday, historians will look back on the image of Drew Barrymorekneeling at the feetof Mulvaney and ask those very same questions.COLLEGE WHERE RILEY GAINES WAS ATTACKED UNDER FIRE FOR CANCELING CONSERVATIVE EVENT: 'ASSAULT ON FREE SPEECH'The movement may have started with empty mantras like \"Women support women!\" and \"Trans women are women!\"But now it's a whole lot deeper than that. It's turned into something far more sinister.Women are afraid. And they have reason to be.Biological women are under attack.Let's take a quick look at just a few of the prominent women who have spoken out against this madness.*New Zealandwomen's rights activist Posie Parker had to cancel speaking engagements becauseviolent protestorsphysically attacked her.*Norwegian actress Tonje Gjevjonfaced prison timefor stating, \"men can't be lesbians.\"*Author J.K. Rowlingreceived death threats simply for stating \"people who menstruate\" could also just be called \"women.\"JK Rowling(Getty Images)Rowling is one of the wealthiest women in the world. Most of us don't have that advantage. Most regular women can't risk losing our jobs or compromising our safety to fight for the cause.RILEY GAINES PRAISES LIONS GM FOR WEARING HOODIE SUPPORTING 'WOMEN AND GIRLS IN SPORTS'I'm lucky to work for a company that supports my right to speak freely. Unfortunately, not everyone can say the same.Even the United States government is against us.In October, the White House invited Dylan Mulvaney to have a sit-down conversation withPresident Joe Biden. And on Mulvaney's \"365th day of girlhood,\" Kamala Harrissent Mulvaney a letterto congratulate the TikTok star on \"living authentically\" and \"courageously.\"Just a couple weeks ago, the Biden administration proposed a set of Title IX rules toexpand the meaningof sexual discrimination to include gender identity. This would prevent schools and colleges from barring biological male athletes from competing on female sports teams.And just days after a transgender extremist gunned down six innocent people — including three children — in Nashville, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre took the podium and declared the transgender community is \"under attack.\"Luckily, The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Actpassed in the House on Thursdayin a 219-203 vote. This legislation aims to prevent biological males from competing in female sports in schools across the country. But no Democrats voted \"yes.\" Not a single one.'SAVE WOMEN'S SPORTS' BILL PASSES HOUSE WITH ZERO VOTES FROM DEMS, WHO CALL IT TRANSGENDER 'BULLYING'The so-called \"attack\" on trans people — notably, transgender women — is a major talking point for news outlets like NPR, CNN and MSNBC. When in reality, this tiny percentage of the population is the most protected group of people in the United States today.Transgender women have a free pass to do whatever they want.Enter female sports events and win all the trophies? You go, girl! Walk around with your genitals outin the locker roomin front of women and children? So brave! Openly mock women and physically attack anyone who has a problem with it? Yes, queen!The bullies have made themselves the victims.And they have the full backing of theBiden administrationand every major corporation in the country.It's time to break the silence.While Riley Gaines has been at the forefront of the fight to protect women's sports, she's not alone. Personalities like Michele Tafoya, Sage Steele and Megyn Kelly have fearlessly defended the right of women to have their own spaces.RILEY GAINES BLASTS SF STATE FACULTY MEMBER WHO CALLED PROTESTS AT HEART OF INCIDENT ‘PEACEFUL’And after the physical assault on Gaines at SFSU, even ESPN anchor Sam Ponder finally broke her silence. She’s been outspoken on the issue ever since — even without her network’s support.\"Just wow,\" Ponder tweeted. \"Yes Riley, so many of us are cheering you on. I imagine this has felt lonely at times and I’m genuinely sorry for my own cowardice in not speaking out sooner. Stay strong sister.\"But it's going to take a whole lot more than that.ESPN PERSONALITIES SLAM BIDEN'S TITLE IX PROPOSAL AMID UPROAR OVER TRANSGENDER ATHLETES IN WOMEN'S SPORTSESPN didn’t publish a single story on the attack on Gaines.
