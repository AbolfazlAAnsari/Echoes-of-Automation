Also: An imperfect church; beyond the Ivy League; transgender rights; harassment of realtors.To the Editor:Re “‘My Body Is a Clock’: Portraits of Chronic Care,” by Sara J. Winston (Opinion guest essay, July 2):I want to thank Ms. Winston for her essay about the challenge of living with a chronic health condition in America. She clearly captured the persistent fear that lives in me and every American with a chronic condition who depends on continuous treatment.I have lifelong asthma and depend on medication. It was diagnosed in early childhood, and I require daily inhalers, oral immune-suppressant medications and vigilance to keep my condition in check.Modern medicine has allowed me to live a full life, but it has also directed its course. My life choices were all based on the essential requirement of maintaining affordable, continuous health care: my career, my employers, proximity to hospitals and a pulmonologist.Our American health care system, which relies heavily on employer-provided health insurance and is unaffordable for those with no health insurance, is a nightmare for people like Ms. Winston and me.As Ms. Winston noted, the Affordable Care Act rule that requires insurers to cover pre-existing medical conditions helped alleviate some of this fear. But the precarious nature of employment, the excesses of our profit-based health care industry and the whims of Congress are constantly in the back of my mind, even now that I am eligible for Medicare.Health care for all is a pro-life issue. It is my top voting concern. How could it not be? My heart hurts for those who suffer chronic medical conditions without affordable health care. There but for the grace of God go I.Nikki LowreyMadison, Ala.To the Editor:Sara J. Winston has provided invaluable insight into the challenges many of us living with multiple sclerosis face. What’s critical is finding a neurologist who will skillfully assess one’s symptoms, confirm the M.S. diagnosis and prescribe a treatment that will prevent further deterioration of one’s nervous system.Access to expert, necessary health care is another challenge. Exorbitantly priced M.S. drugs — the one I use costs $100,000 a year — as well as annual M.R.I. exams, regular blood work and doctor’s appointments are essential to managing the disease, but heightened levels of stress caused by the high cost of care can adversely affect how an M.S. patient feels.Each of the nearly one million people in the United States living with M.S. has a story. Sharing our journeys, as Ms. Winston did, is important for raising awareness of this unpredictable disease and boosting efforts to find a cure.Kenneth BandlerQueensThe writer is a member of the board of trustees of the National M.S. Society’s Greater New York City-Long Island chapter.To the Editor:As a Canadian blessed with universal health care, which is available to citizens in every Group of 7 country except the U.S., I just have one word for Sara J. Winston’s worries about being able to afford to continue her life-transforming treatment for multiple sclerosis.Inhumane.Alison DennisCalgary, Alberta‘Human Beings and the Church Are Imperfect’To the Editor:Re “Who Truly Threatens the Church?,” by David French (column, July 10):Mr. French nails it. Existential humility in the public square must be the essence of safeguarding our shared journey toward truth. The church must come clean.As aclerical abuse survivorin the Roman Catholic Church, I share the trauma that Mr. French’s wife suffered as a victim of child sex abuse within the confines of a Christian fundamentalist community.Human beings and the church are imperfect. True virtue is realized when this imperfection is acknowledged. The truth does set one free.Mark Joseph WilliamsFar Hills, N.J.The writer, a licensed social worker, is a special adviser to the Archdiocese of Newark.To the Editor:David French’s incisive column gets to the core issues of human sinfulness with a love for power and the consequent abuse of it. None of us are immune from these temptations, and his call for Christian honesty and humility is greatly needed.The moral failings of many Christian leaders are often connected with a prideful superiority that lacks compassion for others and the ability to live up to their own judgmental standards.What is needed is not Christian self-righteousness and domination but Christians becoming more like Jesus, who was “full of grace and truth.” Mr. French’s writing exhibits both.Bob FrylingMonument, Colo.Beyond the Ivy LeagueTo the Editor:Re “I Prepped Elite College Applicants. Here’s How the Race Game Is Played,” by Tyler Austin Harper (Opinion guest essay, July 3):Professor Harper is right that gaming the elite school system need not be seen as the only “game” in town.There are just eight Ivy League universities. But there are almost 4,000 other degree-granting colleges in the U.S., with some 1,100 of them two-year community colleges. And most of those schools have wide open doors and cost way less than the Ivy League — and all of them offer some kind of competitive leg up into the middle class.Need to be a master of the universe? Get born into wealth and prep for Harvard.Want a life-enhancing educational experience, with statistically proven financial advantages to make your way in the world? Go to a college.Steven DoloffNew YorkThe writer is a professor of humanities at Pratt Institute and a graduate of public colleges in New York.Threats to Transgender RightsTo the Editor:Re “Tell Me There Isn’t a Witch Hunt in Tennessee,” by Margaret Renkl (Opinion guest essay, July 6):I just turned 22 years old, and I’ve spent all of those years in the state of Georgia. As in Tennessee, trans rights are threatened by legislationrecently passed in Georgiarestricting gender-affirming care.It’s frustrating, because it’s not the people making these decisions. It’s a few extremists.I’m a graduate student studying social work. The social work code of ethics emphasizes social justice, integrity, and the dignity and worth of a person. When I graduate, I plan to work in the medical field as a social worker.How much of my job will be sacrificing these values for the law? How much of my job will be defying the law to do what’s best for my client?I think these are questions all of us, even if we’re not social workers, should ask as we decide if we will be complicit as our neighbors suffer, or if we will be allies and friends to them to work together for change.Emma DuncanAthens, Ga.Harassment of RealtorsTo the Editor:Re “Dangerous Work but Little Help for Women Selling Real Estate” (front page, July 10):I was a receptionist at a suburban Baltimore real estate office for 20 years.Prospective buyers were required to meet their agent in our office, where two forms of ID were photocopied and kept on file. If the agent had any suspicions, she would be accompanied by a manager. Showings at night were heavily discouraged.Any real estate business that does not support its agents in this manner should be shut down.Richard CrystalPikesville, Md.This article appeared in print on page A19."
