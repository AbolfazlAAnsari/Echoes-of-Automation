More importantly, what can they tell us about what comes next in the House of Representatives?The answer to that last question, in short, is more deadlock in the House and the possible collapse of the Republican Party as we know it.First, let's consider the concept ofpolitical realignment. Historically, political realignment has occurred when groups of voters change their affiliation to a new political party or candidate, especially around presidential and midterm elections.Back in 1955, influential political scientist V.O. Keypositedthe idea of realigning reelections to explain how the Republican Party of his day had come to dominate most presidential elections from Abraham Lincoln's surprise victory in 1860 until Franklin D. Roosevelt's ascendancy in 1932.But in fact, realignment had been occurring much earlier, dating back at least to thedeadlocked electionof 1800 between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, and continuing through the beginning of the modern Democratic Party in 1828 with thetriumphant electionof Andrew Jackson.Yet the period between 1852 and 1860 iscrucialhere, for it saw the last time a major political party collapsed (the Whig Party in 1854) and the dissolution of another political party (the Democratic Partyin 1860).Let's start with the Whigs, whoseepic collapseis still the stuff of historical legend. Despite having won two presidential elections and counting such notables as Daniel Webster, Henry Clay and Lincoln among their ranks, by 1854 the Whigs had become hopelessly divided into Northern and Southern factions over the issue of slavery.The tipping point came with the passage of the divisiveKansas-Nebraska Actthat permitted slaveryin all western territories.The result was electrifying. The anti-slavery Whigsfeltthat the party had not gone far enough to resist the expansion of slavery, and they eventually coalesced into the Republican Party.Southern Whigs, for their part,joinedan anti-immigrant party (the American Party) or switched to supporting the Democrats. Whig partisan William Henry Seward, who would go on to become Lincoln'ssecretary of state, wascontentto let his party die: \"Let, then, the Whig party pass. It committed a grievous fault, and grievously hath it answered [for] it. Let it march out of the field, therefore, with all the honors.\"The collapse of the Whig Party soon signaled more divisions to come.

When the Democratic convention refused to accept these demands, the Southern delegateswalkedout.An effort to reunite the party in Baltimore in June equallyfailedto find consensus producing two candidates: Stephen Douglas of Illinois and John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. The Democratic ruptureledin large part to the election of Lincoln andsetthe stage for later Southern secession from the Union.Following the collapse of the Whig Party in 1854 and the Democratic Party's splintering in1860, American political parties have nearly collapsed numerous times.The Republican Party split in 1912 when Theodore Roosevelt led a \"Bull Moose\"insurgencyagainst Republican William Howard Taft; the result was the election of Democrat Woodrow Wilson.The 1924 Democratic Party famouslywentthrough 103 ballots before agreeing on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis of West Virginia.In 1968, the pro- and anti-war Vietnam War factions in the Democratic Partyrupturedover the selection of Hubert H. Humphrey as its nominee, leading to the election of Republican Richard Nixon in the fall.More recently, in the election of 2020, the dissident \"Never Trump\" movement certainlysappedsupport from the Republican Party.Of course, party realignment is a tricky thing since we only come to know that it has happened in hindsight. While some of these disputes led to realignment, often they only signal a loss of power for the party in question in the next election.How does today's House Republican conference fit these patterns of disfunction? For one, theviciousnessof the arguments within the GOP conference andthe threats to membersreveal a party in disarray.
