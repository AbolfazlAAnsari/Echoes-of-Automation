In an excerpt from  an upcoming interview, Harrytold ITV: \"I want a family. Not an institution.\"And yet here they are, fully and willingly creating that fodder themselves.And fodder it is. Among the gossipy allegations Harry lobs at his brother in \"Spare\" are details ofa physical altercationbetween the two during which William knocked Harry to the floor and left him scratched and bruised, and claims that William and his wife, Kate Middleton, were the ones responsible for encouraging Harry's controversial Nazi costume in 2005.  Revelations in \"Spare\" also dish on Meghan's relationship with Kate, including a claim that Kate demanded Meghan apologize for once suggesting she had \"baby brain.\" Buckingham Palace has repeatedly declined to comment on the book.Through these disclosures, what we're seeing is a little brother desperate to fight back against a lifetime of feeling inferior, but doing so in the dirtiest way possible. And, well, it seems pathetic.Competition between children is common, and sibling rivalry between brothers even more so, especially when there are just two of them. Certainly, most aren't born into families with set hierarchies that serve to remind them of their exact place. But brotherly discord has existed throughout time, inspiring countless works of art in all spheres (most of them tragedies). Harry is not special - his is one of the commonest dramas of human nature.He's also not a victim, nor blameless. While much has been made since their union began about Meghan's influence on Harry's defection from the family, by now it's clear that he, wounded, went looking for what he needed: someone to help him separate from his family and, perhaps, someone who supported and understood his anger. He found it in her, a woman whose ambition drove her career as an actress and whose own family life includedcontentious relationshipswith her half-sister and her father;a woman whowas not afraid to express herself,even to royalty.It's clear that Harry and Meghan are, at some level, trying to take control of the narrative about themselves after negative press coverage thatbrought misogyny and racismto bear on an already-toxic family dynamic.  But Harry's attempts now to heal those wounds by making public private family matters aren't noble, and they won't save him, either. In fact, through Harry's revelations, one might now feel the most empathy for William, a man who was raised, from birth, with a set destiny, and, unlike Harry, few choices.William will be king, and Harry will not. But whether that is something William desires, or something he'll instead fulfill out of sheer patriotic and familial duty, is unknown. That's because William is taking the high road of silence. Isn't it ironic that we know so much more about Harry and Meghan, the couple who resigned from royal life because they wished to remain private, than the couple who opted to stay?While we can, and should, have some disdain for how Harry has chosen to approach his life circumstances, it's also possible to have some compassion for him - and understanding. He did not, after all, entirely create himself. And, sheltered and uber-privileged as he was for much of his upbringing, he is likely a fairly immature 38 year old.Now, he's pushing back against the machine that made him in the only way he knows how - and possibly doing so because it's the only way he knows how to make his own money and live independently. He felt exploited as a child and younger adult; he's now in turn profiting off his family (and earningan enormous amount of moneyin the process).Perhaps someday we'll hear from Harry as Harry, a man truly independent of the royal family from which he has claimed, time and again, he desperately wants to separate. Until then, we can likely expect more of the same negativity, blame, immaturity and victimization - qualities, in fact, quite unbecoming of a royal. But, then, Harry no longer is one.Opinion by Peggy DrexlerTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
