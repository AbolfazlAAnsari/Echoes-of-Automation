Everyone agrees that the Constitution's drafters deliberately broke from English practice by creating an independent federal judiciary - in sharp and marked contrast to the courts of 18th century Britain, which were the King's Bench in both name and practice.

In 1802,Democratic-Republicanseffectively eliminated the Supreme Court's entire annual sitting for that year bychanging the court's regular meeting date- anot-so-subtle threatto the Federalist justices to behave.Throughout the antebellum era,Congress requiredthe justices to \"ride circuit,\" spending as much as six months of every year traveling the country to hear cases on lower courts - not because it served any especially noble purpose, but becauseit helped to remind everyone of their relative place.And the court's place, for much of this period, was literally in the bottom of the US Capitol - without offices of its own, much of a budget or even full-time staff. (The court would move upstairs to the Old Senate Chamber in 1860, but not toits own building until 1935, and even then, only because Congress appropriated the money to build it.)In one especially notorious 1868 episode, after an oral argument signaled that the justices may have been ready to invalidate congressional Reconstruction measures, Congress simply stripped the court's power to decide that specific case - a movethe justices unanimously upheld.

Rather, we should be focusing instead on the business of the court as a whole -and how Congress can and should be more involved in directing and supervising that business, as it was for so much of our history.Some of those reforms ought to focus on technical changes to the court's docket - taking back a modicum of control over which cases the justices decide and how. But some of those reforms ought to likewise be focused on increasing the accountability of the justices for their behavior, and not just their decisions - such as the bipartisanethics reform billrecently introduced by Sens. Angus King, an independent from Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska.Restoring the healthier interbranch dynamic that kept the court at least largely in its lane for most of its first two centuries is something in which anyone who cares about the Supreme Court as an institution ought to be invested, regardless of how much they do or don't like the current justices.Opinion by Steve VladeckTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
