The 2022 midterms proved that an obsession with the 2020 election is electoral poison, such that a true RINO scheming to destroy the party from within would want as many Republicans to share this fixation as possible.Of course, that's exactly what Trump has sought. It's not that he is trying to deliberately to undermine the party, but that his own personal interests and psychological needs take precedence. He'd no more sacrifice anything he truly cares about for the sake of the party than he'd jump off the Verrazano bridge.Pretty much everyone he calls a RINO has devoted his or her adult life to the Republican Party. Trump is different. Prior to 2012, he ping-ponged back and forth among various party affiliations. So attenuated was his connection to the party in 2016, RNC chairman Reince Priebus famously fashioned a loyalty pledge to get him to commit to supporting the eventual nominee.This makes Trump an odd arbiter of who's a genuine Republican or not. It's not the zeal of the convert, because his own conversion is still tenuous and situational. A fear that haunts Republicans about 2024 is that someone will beat Trump in the primary campaign, and the former president will turn around and try to sabotage the nominee out of spite.This isn't a far-fetched worry. When Brian Kemp wouldn't do his bidding after 2020, Trump issued forth with arguably the most RINO-worthy sentiment of any major Republican in recent memory. \"Stacey, would you like to take his place? It's OK with me,\" he said of Stacey Abrams at a rally. \"Of course having her, I think, might be better than having your existing governor, if you want to know what I think. Might very well be better.\"It's hard to see any other Republican living that down, but Trump can't himself be a RINO by definition. If he decides to try to blow up the GOP in 2024, bizarrely, the supposed RINOs will be the ones who decide to stick with the Republicans.The level of personal deference required to pass the Trump RINO test is extraordinary, and apparently escalating. Days ago, his loyalists were braying for DeSantis to speak out about the possibility of a Trump indictment. DeSantis ended up making a cogent and pointed critique of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, while stipulating that he doesn't know about paying hush money to porn stars.This set off the likes of Steve Bannon and Mike Lindell who can't bear the slightest criticism of Trump, as if he were St. Francis of Assisi instead of Donald J. Trump of Mar-a-Lago. When DeSantis doubled down by talking about the importance of truth and character in an interview with Piers Morgan, Donald Trump Jr. lashed out by slamming the governor for - what else? - acting \"on orders from his RINO establishment owners.\"Yes, truth and character are now RINO values.Obviously, the label itself has outlived its usefulness, although it's not going away until Trump goes away. For that to happen Republicans will have to become, in Trump terms, a RINO party - not any less conservative, less fierce, or less Republican, but no longer beholden to the man who has successfully made himself the measure of all things.Trump's definition of a RINO is a travesty, and it's used to abuse Republicans in good standing whose commitment to the party is deeper and more principled than his will ever be."
