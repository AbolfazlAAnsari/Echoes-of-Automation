They need help to maintain relationships and community ties. Only with these things in place can we hope to reduce reoffending, bring down crime and relieve the pressure on acreaking and overcrowded criminal justicesystem.Campbell RobbChief executive at NacroMenopause drives women to the edge, and we need to help themAt long last we are talking about alternatives to HRT being provided on the NHS.For a large percentage of the population lifestyle changes and solutions such ascognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)will be enough to get them through theirmenopause.  Not every woman needs a medicalised solution, neither does every woman want to or can take it.For too long we have only had HRT as a solution to troubling symptoms, unless we had the money to pay to see a complementary therapist. This for many is money they simply don’t have, when the decision is whether to heat your home or eat, the option of a therapist is simply not on the table.Menopause symptoms are felt by every woman and person with ovaries, no matter their wealth, social standing or ethnicity. This means that it impacts their ability to work, their finances, and their ability to contribute to their local economy. It also affects their relationships, whether with their partner, children, wider family, friends or colleagues; sometimes with devastating effects.Without meaningful support women and their dependents can tip into a downward spiral very quickly. This is why the announcement that CBT for menopause will be available on the NHS, is so welcome. It cannot replace HRT for those who are really struggling, but it can work alongside it, or for some be an optionwhere taking HRT is not possible.Menopausedrives women to the edge.It’s not helpful when the NHS and its support services are already there ahead of them.Kate UsherMenopause coach"
