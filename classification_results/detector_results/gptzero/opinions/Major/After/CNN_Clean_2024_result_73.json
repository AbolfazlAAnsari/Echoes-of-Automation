Gerwig's direction in \"Barbie\" is grand in scope, no doubt, but it's her impeccably observed depiction of a strained mother-daughter relationship in 2017's \"Lady Bird\" that broke my heart and cemented her as an astute filmmaker.Robbie does a fine job as the titular doll in \"Barbie,\" but she is far more affecting in the few minutes of screentime she has in Wes Anderson's recent \"Asteroid City\" and far funnier in \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" - where her excellent comedic timing comes across much better than it does in the hollow world of \"Barbie.\"With just over a month to go before the ceremony itself, don't expect the furor over \"Barbie\" to go away anytime soon. But while some of its fans flood the internet with anger, it might be worth seeking out some of 2023's other female-directed films, from A.V. Rockwell's \"A Thousand and One\" to \"Priscilla\" and \"Origin\" and \"How To Have Sex,\" all of which offer far more nuanced and complex studies of women and all of which haven't had so much as a whiff of winning a seat at the Oscars' table.Opinion by Hannah RyanTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
