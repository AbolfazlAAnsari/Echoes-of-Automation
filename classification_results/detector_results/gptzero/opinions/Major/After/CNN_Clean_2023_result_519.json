Newcomer Sophia Smith was a highlight; her goal in the 14th minute put the US on the board faster than any team yet, and her second - 40 minutes later - made her an early breakout star.Fellow World Cup rookie Trinity Rodman (and yes, that Rodman, but let's focus on her feet and not her ancestry), the NWSL Rookie of the Year in 2021, had a scary first minute whenchallenged by Tran Thi Thu, but returned to play after leaving the pitch briefly for treatment.For veteran Alex Morgan,a saved penalty kickin the first half shocked everyone but Vietnam's fiery keeper, Tran Thi Kim Thanh. CaptainLindsey Horan added a goalto Smith's two for the win and legend Megan Rapinoe came on the field in the second half to mark her 200th cap.Overall, however, the game saw a US offense that had trouble finishing and a defense that was simply untested, just the first step in a long journey for these players as they seek that historic third consecutive title, something no one (and let's say it one last time:  men or women) has done.Despite the loss, Vietnam's debut is also something to celebrate, one of eight new teams that pepper the 32-team bracket, a huge leap from the12 teams that assembled back in 1991for the inaugural tournament. Vietnam landed in a tough group in their World Cup draw, facing not only the Americans but also a perennially strong Dutch squad, meaning they likely will not move forward past the group stage.But the presence of newbies like Vietnam, Haiti, the Philippines, Zambia (whichshocked Germany3-2 in a friendly earlier this month) and Morocco (whose women's team now takes center stage after their men's side were thebreakout stars of the men's World Cuplast November in Qatar) is an important marker in the global reach of the women's game.New teams mean there might be blowouts in which the neophytes will suffer, but Vietnam showed that it won't necessarily be the David to anyone's Goliath. This tournament's expanded field also provides a microscope for the inequities and abuses that run amok in the women's game, whether the controversies surrounding the Colombian squaddocumented by historian Brenda Elseyor the lack of support for the Jamaican team, which had tocrowdsource its fundingin order to make the trip.While the competition is increasingly fierce and (did you watchNigeria versus Canadaon Thursday?) unpredictable, the US has a heck of a chance to make history here, especially with 38-year-old Rapinoe making clear that this is her last rodeo (and who wants to be the one who stands in the way of her nabbing that crown one more time?).That said, what lies ahead remains to be seen. Will England ride the wave of itsEuro 2022 titleto face the US in the final or did its 1-0 start against Haiti foreshadow a different future? Could the Aussies use their home field advantageto give Sam Kerra well-deserved big moment in the hometown sun? The long, unsure road is what makes the whole thing so thrilling.But win or lose, there is no doubt that when the USWNT eventually returns home, its bench will remain deep and America's soccer train will keep rolling. There are battles yet to be fought, on andoff the field, but just like Messi,who brought home the men's trophyin December for his home country at last, there is nothing left for the USWNT to prove to their fans or to the world.Opinion by Amy BassTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
