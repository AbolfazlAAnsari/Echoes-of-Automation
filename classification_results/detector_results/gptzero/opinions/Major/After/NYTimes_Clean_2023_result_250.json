Politicians, diplomats and any citizen who would like to see a cease-fire and to see international law respected should heed what a Gaza teenager stated about her horrible inheritance: “It’s like we are overpaying the price for a sin we didn’t commit.”This wise statement is applicable to all the civilians and innocents, Israeli and Palestinian, who are caught in the crossfire of one of the thorniest and deadliest geopolitical issues of the modern era.Mr. Kristof wraps this poignant piece up by admitting that he does not have all the answers, but he does pose an important question: “What policies will reduce the risk, not inflame it, while honoring the intrinsic value of Palestinian life as well as Israeli life?”We can only hope that the major political players work diligently to answer that question so the Middle East and the greater world move toward a lasting peace and not the nihilistic destruction that is unbearable for those trapped there.Matt TanguayAnn Arbor, Mich.To the Editor:Nicholas Kristof’s recent columns deliver impassioned pleas on behalf of Gaza’s endangered children.The road to their salvation lies not with reproof of Israel; Israel’s first responsibility is to her citizens. Hope for Gaza lies with Gazans.Let the Gaza masses demand the immediate, unconditional surrender of all Hamas and Islamic Jihad kingpins; the immediate, unconditional release of all hostages; and the immediate, unconditional liberation of over two million civilians from the grip of manipulative, savage overlords.If you care for Gaza and for her children of today and of tomorrow, don’t appeal to Israel — appeal to Gaza.Sheldon StohlBeersheba, IsraelTo the Editor:Re “Netanyahu Finds Himself at War in Gaza and at Home” (news article, nytimes.com, Oct. 29):In assigning blame for Israel’s recent security lapse, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would do well to look at himself. Apart from its happening on his watch, the judicial coup he was staging proved the perfect distraction for Hamas to exploit.Bruce EllersteinNew YorkMatthew Perry Was More Than a ‘Friend’To the Editor:Re “Matthew Perry, 1969-2023: As a Wisecracker on ‘Friends,’ Could HeBeMore Imitated?” (obituary, front page, Oct. 30):As a child Matthew Perry wasa strong Canadian junior tennis player.In the early 2000s, he enlisted the help of my son, a teaching pro, to be a hitting partner.In late 2001 my son died unexpectedly. We had a service for him and invited Matthew to be a reader. Not only did he come and do a lovely job as a reader along with a few others, but after I returned to Portland, he sent a large check “to defray expenses” incurred, a lovely and thoughtful gift.When Matthew’s sad book recounting his drug and alcohol addictions came out, I wrote him of my concerns for him but praise for his candor.Our family has never forgotten both the happy connection my son had with Matthew as well as his graciousness in our time of sorrow.We did not know him in the television sense, but he far exceeded being a “friend” to us.Ellin JohnsonPortland, Ore.Choosing Whether to Shop Online or in PersonTo the Editor:Re “The City That Never Sleeps … or Shops in Person,” by Sonja Anderson (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Oct. 29):I co-chair Manhattan Community Board 8’s Small Business Committee but write as an individual. I have been concerned about the significant loss of New York City’s small businesses, the mom-and-pop shops that lure us to explore new neighborhoods or frequent our own community’s specialized stores. At least they used to. Before they became chain stores and vacant spaces.I was surprised that Sonja Anderson, in her lament for the congestion and environmental harm that delivery proliferation causes, didn’t discuss the damage to small businesses.Even years before the pandemic, the owner of one of my neighborhood’s candy shops (where I bought gummy sharks for birthday cupcakes) complained that online shopping was doing him in. Did him in. The business is years gone.Yes, there are other reasons, such as rising rents and financial incentives, that keep storefronts empty, but certainly online shopping is one cause.Publicizing the effect of online shopping on our beloved local stores may just bring them more business.Alida CampNew YorkTo the Editor:I can’t speak for New York, but I’ve noticed that shopping in person where I live in California is simply not that much fun anymore. I used to find stores well stocked, not only with the things I was looking for, but also with an array of other temptations I might not have encountered if I’d simply used my browser to zero in on my immediate desire.Now they seem to have an anemic selection, and I frequently cannot find what I came for, even if it’s available from the retailer’s website.I for one would prefer to handle my potential purchases before I plunk down my cash. I would prefer not to deal with the endless boxes, the trips to mail returns, and above all the inability to get what I want when I want it, which is the whole point of having a physical store in the first place.Retailers, if you stock it, we will come.Jason HollisterOakland, Calif.This article appeared in print on page A21."
