But recent events have made the case for spending at least as much as we currently do, and perhaps more.First, one of the revelations from the war in Ukraine has been that those expensive NATO weapons systems, from Javelin anti-tank missiles to HIMARS, actually do work.More important, it turns out that the era of large-scale conventional warfare isn’t over after all, and there are real concerns about whether our weapons production capacity is large enough to deal with the potential threats.By all means, let’s have good-faith arguments about how much America should spend on its military. But repeating 60-year-old clichés about the military-industrial complex doesn’t help the discussion.Quick HitsSometimes Ukraine’s war looksmore like the Somme than like Desert Storm.IsUkraine’s economystabilizing?Israel’s economic realitymay not match the hype.Paying for Israel aid by …going easy on tax cheatsPHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Illustration by Sam Whitney/The New York Times; photograph by Vasko/Getty Images FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
