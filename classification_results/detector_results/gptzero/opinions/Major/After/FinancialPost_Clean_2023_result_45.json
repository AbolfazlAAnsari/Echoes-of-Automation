Not everyone with an opioid addiction will end up overdosing, and not everyone with a chronic addiction is destined to stay addicted. Recovery is possible and policies should provide viable pathways for drug users to enter treatment and pursue recovery. Pressuring addicted individuals to undergo treatment is controversial, but positive incentives alone may not be working.Addiction is treatable and more focus on evidence-based treatment options, including new licensed drugs like Sublocade, could help reduce demand for dangerous illicit drugs. Rather than disorderly street encampments that attract crime and degrade the public realm, purpose-built recovery communities could provide the sustainable conditions to allow some users to transition to a drug-free life over time.The Alberta government's \"recovery-orientated system of care\" model incorporates both these tactics and shows promise. It needs to be monitored closely, with best practice shared. We believe addicted drug users have a right to recovery and the services that meet their treatment needs, not a right to maintain their addiction.Canada needs a more ambitious national strategy that gives due emphasis to recovery, and that provinces can adapt to suit their local needs, with robust measures that allow us to compare approaches and see what is really working.Today's metrics are mostly at the provincial level and are all negative - deaths and hospitalizations - or simply inputs - like how many Naloxone kits have been distributed, or treatment spaces commissioned. Better data should be published on the impact of all interventions, down to the municipal level or lower, and we need metrics that chart the whole journey of addiction, from first engagement through to recovery.A third way on addiction policy is possible, but that needs a fresh debate where we are honest about what hasn't worked, clear about what success looks like and take an evidence-based and non-ideological approach to the problem that leverages the right level of government to play its part.British Columbia remains the epicentre of this drug addiction crisis. Unfortunately, it is no longer where pioneering policy is making any meaningful difference. No one wants a return to a 1980s-style crackdown, but we must be prepared to move beyond policies that have not delivered the turnaround we have all been promised repeatedly for over 20 years.Today's depressing policy goal - albeit one that has still not been met - of keeping a slightly higher share of desperate people from dying cannot be the summit of our ambitions.National PostBlair Gibbs is a policy consultant and former advisor to the U.K. prime minister, who is a member of the Stanford Network on Addiction Policy and co-author of the new report, \"Canada's Health Crisis: Profiling Opioid Addiction in BC and Alberta.\" Keith Humphreys is a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University and served as senior drug policy advisor in U.S. President Barack Obama's White House.
