That's just more evidence of how the far left ends up unintentionally functioning as a fundraising arm of the GOP.Now's the time for Biden and Democrats to propose their own crime-fighting policies. In his budget, Biden is expected to propose more funding for hisSafer American Plan, while highlighting the far right's lurch away from law and order under the sway of former President Donald Trump and some of his supporters, including their callsto defund the FBI. That's a debate worth having that can isolate the extremes while highlighting the common ground between most Americans.Biden is right on the politics and the policy here, butDemocrats do have a reasonto be frustrated on purely procedural grounds. It was an unforced error for the Biden White House to say initially it was for the bill,before it was against it. That caused a lot of needless confusion.But what happens in DC doesn't stay in DC. It becomes a symbol of urban success or decay that members of Congress take back home to their constituents. Advocates of DC home rule and statehood should know that soft-on-crime policies enacted by the City Council of our nation's capital are the quickest way to ensure that those goals are never achieved.Biden understands that if Democrats want to move America's policies in a moderately more progressive direction, they cannot do it at the expense of public safety. Because that's the fastest path toward political backlash.Opinion by John AvlonTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
