The writer, a Jewish freelance theatre director, clearly feels the Bernstein role was a missed opportunity for a Jewish actor.Whether one agrees with his observations or concluded from his list of performances where Christian actors played Jewish roles that a Jew might have offered greater “authenticity” is a moot point. But we should remember that all actors are required to pretend to be other than themselves, and we’ve all witnessed Jewish actors insightfully portray other sexes, religions, races, and sexual preferences to wild applause and huge critical acclaim.Whether the decision to enhance Bradley Cooper’s performance by the addition of a prosthetic nose is a success remains to be seen but, despite various interpretations of the morality of using such an emotive device we do know the wider Bernstein family have approved the addition.Once we’ve all had a chance to see the film, we can all make our own decisions about the rightness or wrongness of the directors’ decisions. But going with an open mind is vital if we are to try and see into the heart of Leonard Bernstein or the way his Jewishness steered his course through life.Steve MackinderDenver, Norfolk"
