Labor is desperately afraid of alienating the radical Islamists in key marginal seats.What proportionality can you apply when over 1000 of your citizens are butchered by ideologues with no moral compass? It is obvious that the appalling behaviour of the Hamas terrorists was deliberately designed to create a provocation, leaving the Israelis no option but to respond to these cowardly terrorists who are hiding among civilians in Gaza. To pull back now would be a mistake and just play into the hands of the Hamas terrorists.Greg AngeloBalwyn North, VicHamas can't be trustedSince the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, in which thousands of Israelis were forcibly displaced, Hamas has violated each of the dozens of ceasefires to which it has agreed. Danish Khan (Letters, November 13) conflates his laudable desire for peace, which every Israeli shares, with demands for a ceasefire. I respectfully ask him, why does he think Hamas would treat the next one any differently?Joshua HoppBronte, NSWFrench flip-flopAustralians recall French President Emmanuel Macron calling PM Scott Morrison a liar. Now Macron, in a 180-degree reversal of his earlier views, claims Israel's bombing campaign has \"no legitimacy\". Australia's Penny Wong correctly acknowledges that any ceasefire would require both sides to yield. Hamas supporters fail to acknowledge that there would be no bombing had the events of October 7 not been initiated by Hamas, and that Israel has made it quite evident that the bombing will cease when the hostages are returned to Israel. All calls for a ceasefire must be directed towards Hamas.Peter B. AlexanderSouth Yarra, VicWhat 'Western values'?Looking away when Israel openly and defiantly violates UN rules and destroys civilian life indiscriminately is unacceptable. This war could make a mockery of so-called \"Western values\" and \"the rule-based order\". Why can't the IDF fight Hamas door to door instead of dropping bombs on schools, hospitals and civilian infrastructure? The Kurds did just that in Syria and Iraq. They fought Islamic State door to door, and won without violating the Geneva Conventions.What the IDF is doing is unacceptable and should be deplored by everyone who has a conscience.A. OzaydinGold Coast, QldBombing doesn't helpThree observations. If Hamas had dug tunnels under an Israeli village or hospital, Israel would certainly not bomb those places while Israeli citizens were there. The intense bombing of Gaza is believed to have killed some of the hostages being held by Hamas. Hamas has suspended negotiations on the release of hostages while Israel continues to bomb hospitals and refugee camps in Gaza, particularly in the south.Gordon PayneSouth Fremantle, WA"
