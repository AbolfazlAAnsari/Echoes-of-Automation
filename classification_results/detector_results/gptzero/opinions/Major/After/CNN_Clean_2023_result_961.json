This view was reversed by the US Navy in 1974showing significant evidencethe explosion was an onboard coal fire.After an initial confrontation between US naval forces and North Vietnamese submarines on August 2, 1964,reports of a second confrontationthe night of August 4, 1964, led Congress to pass the Gulf of Tonkin Resolutionthree days afterward, authorizing President Lyndon Johnson to send US forces to Vietnam and starting the Vietnam War.Bothformer US Defense Secretary Robert McNamaraand top Vietnamese leadersconfirmed retrospectivelythat reports of an attack were false, based on bad intelligence and misrepresentations of intercepted communications.When the US Congress was considering declaring war after Mexico supposedly invaded American territory and killed American soldiers, a then-obscure congressman from Illinois namedAbraham Lincolndemanded to know \"the particular spot of soil in which the blood of our citizens was so shed.\"US soldiers were pushing deeper into territory thathistorians agreewas Mexican. Still, inflamed US public opinion led President James Polk to act andCongress to declare war.Four weeks after Adolf Hitler was sworn in aschancellor of Germany, theReichstag, home of the German parliament in Berlin, was set ablaze.Hitler quickly condemned communist agitators using the episode as a pretext tosuspendingcivil liberties, rival political parties, an independent press and the assassination of rivals. Hitler was catapulted froma weak placeholder chancellorinto a dictator withunprecedented powerwho established the Third Reich.Only after World War II didevidence emerge suggestingthe Nazis planned and ordered the fire, andGermany posthumously pardoneda falsely accused scapegoat in the arson in 2008.These historical examples offer clear lessons that are relevant to today's conflict.Biden's Israel speechunderscored the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians who were raped, mutilated, tortured and massacred, withbodies burned alive.He also addressed the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza, exacerbated by the apparent misfired missile of a Palestinian militant group hitting a Gaza hospital in error, and pushed for access to humanitarian assistance to those in Gaza,including $100 million morefrom the US to Palestinians.The deeper takeaways underscoring Biden's speech are the need for the world to stop, catch its breath, attribute culpability accurately and not further vilify victims or allow villains to appear as victims.In short, Biden reminded us we must, before rushing into hasty escalation:1. Check facts - think like a detective, not like a partisan.2. Verify sources - determine what is missing or uncertain.3. Demand government transparency - get the full story.4. Beware of the manipulated facts of demagoguery - question motives of the messengers.The wrongly celebrated \"wisdom of crowds\" can lead manipulated mobs to spread bigotry, superstition and catastrophic violence.Opinion by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and Steven TianTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
