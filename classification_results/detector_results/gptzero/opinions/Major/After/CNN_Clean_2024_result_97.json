Haley is right. Trump's plan is to impose a 10% tariff that acts like a sales tax that will mainly fall on ordinary workers, the kind who shop at Walmart, although it is nominally targeted at foreigners.

A plan that makes it look as if those mean, cheating foreigners will pay our taxes for us sounds great, and who has time to check the math?The truth about tariffs is that they are a fee charged to people who import goods into the US. The government gets the revenue from the tariff, but the importer normally factors that amount into the price at which it sells products to Americans. So, consumers are ultimately footing the bill for tariffs like the ones Trump advocates.Here is some advice: If a politician pitches a tax plan that sounds too good to be true, check your wallet. And while we all learn to get better at understanding tax and the other laws that affect us, day to day, we can stop blaming the salespeople-politicians for pitching their plans. We get what we vote for. Caveat emptor, as they say.Opinion by Edward J. McCafferyTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
