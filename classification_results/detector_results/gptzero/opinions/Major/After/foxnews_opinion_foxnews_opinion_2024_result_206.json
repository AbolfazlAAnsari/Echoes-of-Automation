He's now officially a lame duck with six months to go.Biden was a victim here of a corrupt Democratic machine (with a complicit media) that thought it could pull off a grand election-year deceit despite Biden's failing cognitive abilities.Theestablishment and a compliant mediaconvinced millions of primary voters that he was of sound mind and ready to serve four more years. This lust for power put America in danger. How could they be so unpatriotic?President Biden and former President Jimmy Carter(AP)So where will Biden stand in the history books? He wasn't a failed president because of his declining cognitive abilities. It was his policies that wrecked America.AMERICA'S WORST EX-PRESIDENTS: WOULD THESE 4 MEN BE ON YOUR LIST?From his first days in the Oval Office, he governed from the far left oneverything from climate changeto radical income redistribution to massive government expansionism to racial politics to a \"blame America first\" foreign policy to his dangerous weaponization of every agency of government, from the IRS to the State Department to the FBI to the Justice Department and perhaps even the Secret Service.He made Richard Nixon look like an amateur.It's hard to point to a single policy that he got right. On the economy he was catastrophically bad. The trillions of dollars of debt he rang up bought nothing.He sentinflation to the highest levelsin almost 40 years.

He put America back into the corrupt Paris climate accords. The rest of the world went on using more fossil fuels than ever. By impeding U.S. oil and gas production and pipelines, he played into the hands of our enemies –China and Iran.Gas prices rose. Small business confidence sagged. Two-thirds of Americans consistently told pollsters that the economy was \"fair\" or \"poor.\" Poverty rates rose.Even the one statistic that Biden boasts about – job creation – is a mirage. Most of the jobs were government or health care jobs. With the government borrowing $2 trillion a year, there is no reason the government should be hiring more workers.WHAT MAKES A PRESIDENT GREAT?Then there was the sheer incompetence. The bungled Afghanistan withdrawal was a national security disaster. The border became a broken dam, with some 10 million illegals flowing into the country. The government spent $7 billion to build electric vehicles, and only a handful got built.Biden gave away hundreds of billions of dollars for an illegal andimmoral student loan forgivenessprogram. He put regulators of key agencies in charge even though – or because – they hate business. Less than 10% of his appointees had any business experience.
