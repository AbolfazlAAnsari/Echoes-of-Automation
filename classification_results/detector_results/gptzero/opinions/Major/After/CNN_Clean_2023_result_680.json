At the end of last year, mosteconomistsexpected theeconomyto contract over that period because of severe inflation and, in response, rapid interest rate increases.

And the Fed is intent on softening up the labor market to further curb inflation by targetingwages.So, ifspending growthis starting to exceed income growth, how are Americans paying for things?

Granted, Americans are earning more, but the total household debt-to-annual personal income ratio is now back up to its pre-pandemic level, according to our calculations.Credit card delinquencieshave also steadily climbed and are now back up to 2019 levels.

Most of us have run up credit cards at one point or another; paying them down usually requires sacrificing some spending.US consumers have also leaned on their pandemic-fueled savings. Pandemic-relief money from the government and spending that people skipped early in the pandemic resulted in a national savings war chest of about$2.1 trillion, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco study. Those savings are rapidly being spent and are currently estimated to have dropped to just $190 billion.
