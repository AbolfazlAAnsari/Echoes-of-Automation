Critiquing the devastating impacts of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine and calling for its end - speech protected by Russian law and Russia's international human rights obligations. The 62-year-old lawyer, opposition politician and grassroots human rights activist was arrested in April 2022 for publicly expressing concerns about his council's plan to hold a children's art competition in Moscow, given the mass killing of Ukrainian children by Russian military forces. He suggested that such an event would appear to be \"a feast in time of plague\" and instead proposed honouring victims with a minute of silence.In July of 2022, a Moscow court convicted Gorinov of disseminating \"knowingly false information\" about the Russian armed forces under Article 207.3 of the Russian Criminal Code.A year into his imprisonment, Gorinov suffers from long-lasting bronchitis and has been denied access to adequate medical care. He is perpetually deprived of sleep, with guards checking on him every two hours, even through the night. July 26 marked his second birthday in arbitrary detention and Aug. 8 is the scheduled date for the appeal of his unjust conviction.Gorinov received the first prison sentence under Russia's new legislation aimed at suppressing opposition to the war, but many others have followed. According to OVD-Info, Russia's leading human rights watchdog, 114 people have received draconian sentences under these laws. Russia's systematic crackdown on the anti-war movement has led to more than 20,000 people(https://en.ovdinfo.org/wartime-repressions-report#1) being detained for peaceful anti-war protests, with more than 600 Russian citizens(https://en.ovdinfo.org/antiwar-infographics?_gl=1*ycnsn4*_ga*MTk3MjQ3NzE2Mi4xNjQzMzY4NjQ5*_ga_J7DH9NKJ0R*MTY4MTQxNTMxOC4zMy4xLjE2ODE0MTU0OTYuMjYuMC4w) facing criminal prosecution for their anti-war activism.The crackdown has targeted prominent pro-democracy and human rights activists including Vladimir Kara-Murza(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-house-senate-vote-to-give-russian-dissident-vladimir-kara-murza/), Canada's newest honorary citizen, and Nobel Prize-winning \"Memorial\" leader Oleg Orlov(https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-is-rotting-absurdity-repression-veteran-rights-campaigner-says-2023-07-12/). It has also targeted such everyday citizens as Alexei Moskalev(https://en.ovdinfo.org/moskalevs-story), who was imprisoned after his 13-year-old daughter created an anti-war painting in her art class.The UN Human Rights Committee(https://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2FPPRiCAqhKb7yhstWB5OJfDOQhMEkiX20XNhLNfx3Ua79YTO797pfAxhNTrVgG%2Ff4Oa6%2BJnkGMdF2Jl6FnbSCVzY2f2R5UrD%2F1FLrNpFUItOISH4X9TGbgzYTD) has expressed deep concern regarding these legal amendments and has called on the Russian Federation to \"repeal all legislation unduly restricting freedom of expression,\" including Article 207.3, under which Gorinov was convicted.In March, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (UNWGAD) concluded(https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/issues/detention-wg/opinions/session95/A-HRC-WGAD-2022-78-AEV.pdf) that Gorinov's deprivation of liberty is \"arbitrary,\" a violation of Russia's obligations under international human rights law, and called on Russia to release him \"immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law.\"Russia has failed to implement these urgent requests.Terry Glavin: The men who dare defy Vladimir Putin(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/the-men-who-dare-defy-vladimir-putin)'All parties on side' to grant Russian activist Kara-Murza honorary Canadian citizenship: MP(https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/mps-say-russian-activist-vladimir-kara-murza-should-be-given-honorary-citizenship)Since Feb. 22, 2022, Canada has contributed more than $5 billion(https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2023/02/canada-to-increase-support-for-security-and-stabilization-efforts-in-ukraine.html) in economic, humanitarian, military and development assistance to Ukraine, as well as security and stabilization support. In tandem, we should increase our support for Russian democracy and anti-war activists, paving the way for them to build a free and democratic Russia.Canada and other countries that oppose the war in Ukraine can act in solidarity with Alexei Gorinov and his fellow dissidents by imposing targeted Magnitsky-style sanctions against those responsible for his arbitrary detention and violation of fair trial rights. Such a move would not only hold his persecutors accountable for violating his internationally recognized human rights, but could deter further violations, including by judges and prosecutors involved in his upcoming appeal hearings.These measures have precedent. Last November, Canada(https://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2022/2022-11-23/html/sor-dors238-eng.html) enacted sanctions against perpetrators involved in Vladimir Kara-Murza's politically motivated detention - using the Magnitsky legislation that Kara-Murza had been instrumental in authoring. This spring, the U.S.(https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1320), the U.K.(https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-sanctions-fsb-agents-and-russian-investigators-behind-arrest-of-british-russian-national-vladimir-kara-murza) and the EU followed suit.Other measures to support Gorinov might include Canada requesting to send our diplomatic representatives to monitor his appeal hearings in the Russian court, and encouraging our allies to do the same. Foreign NGOs or lawyers can file amicus briefs to the court on Gorinov's behalf. Allies and supporters can draw attention to his egregious and emblematic case, demanding his immediate and unconditional release.One of Putin's greatest fears(https://time.com/5039688/vladimir-putin-fears-own-people/) is that his own people will rise up against him. This fear is well-founded - many ordinary Russians risk their freedom and their lives to advocate for human rights and democracy every day. By empowering Russian champions of human rights and democracy, we are also countering Russia's aggression in Ukraine - a pernicious assault on the rules-based international order. At the same time, we are fostering the conditions for lasting peace in the region.Special to National PostBill Browder is the Head of the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign(https://www.magnitskyawards.com/about/the-global-magnitsky-justice-campaign/) and author of Red Notice and Freezing Order.
