Yes, it took me three years after graduation to figure out what I really wanted to do with my life, but I then got a master’s degree in marriage and family therapy. I have had a successful career in private practice as a psychotherapist for 40 years and have founded and run an online school for professional continuing education as well as a nonprofit organization.I use the thinking and listening skills that I learned in my philosophy classes every single day in both my private practice and my other businesses. I learned discipline and time management by going to class every day and completing assignments in a timely manner. The writing skills that I had to develop as well have been invaluable to me and my career.I also believe that the critical thinking skills learned in liberal arts programs protect democracy and freedom.Christina VeselakWayne, W.Va.To the Editor:As an astrophysicist, I study distant denizens of the dark universe. Similar to Beth Ann Fennelly’s experience as a creative writing teacher, people often point out that my work is useless. I usually smile and say, “I completely agree, but some of the most useless endeavors are among the most important.”Rebecca OppenheimerNew YorkThe writer is a curator and a professor of astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History.Tuberville’s Blockade, and a Problem in the SenateTo the Editor:Re “Military Promotions Approved After Tuberville Lifts His Blockade” (front page, Dec. 6):There must be a collective sigh of relief within the Beltway, and most certainly at the Pentagon, now that Senator Tommy Tuberville, Republican of Alabama, has dropped his blockade of most military promotions over the policy of abortion access for military personnel.While this senator’s action was certainly reprehensible, the Senate did not even attempt to address the real issue. It’s the Senate’s archaic rules that give an individual senator the power to put a hold on any nomination.The real issue is why an individual senator has such dictatorial power. Interestingly, neither party is willing to open that Pandora’s box because all senators relish it. That is the real problem.Subir MukerjeeOlympia, Wash.Living With GriefTo the Editor:Re “It’s OK to Never ‘Get Over’ Your Grief,” by Mikolaj Slawkowski-Rode (Opinion guest essay, Dec. 3):For those of us who lost a parent or sibling in childhood, the idea that we should one day be over our grief is not just hurtful, but harmful as well.I applaud this guest essay and would point out that encouraging people to move past their grief is particularly bad for kids who may blame themselves when they can’t. People who don’t understand this are usually those who have yet to live through the loss of someone they depended on for self-definition.Dr. Slawkowski-Rode correctly blames Freud for our continued psychological approach to loss, but after Freud lost his daughter Sophie, even he changed his thinking on grief. Unfortunately, his earlier writings were already widely read and would go on to influence generations of clinicians.For people who have grown up grieving, loss is part of who we are. We can no more “get past it” than erase ourselves.Ann FaisonPasadena, Calif.The writer is the host of the podcast “Are We There Yet? Understanding Adolescent Grief” and is the author of “Dancing With the Midwives: A Memoir of Art and Grief.”Ethical Issues Raised by a Gilgo Beach Murders DocumentaryTo the Editor:Re “Outcry Follows True-Crime Deal for Wife of Gilgo Beach Suspect” (front page, Nov. 29):That Peacock, the streaming service owned by NBCUniversal, is paying the family of an alleged serial killer for participation in a documentary series about the murders, and had to outbid other avaricious media companies equally eager to capitalize on the public’s insatiable appetite for true-crime programming, the more salacious the better, is as disturbing as it is unsurprising.Until very recently, true-crime stories were relegated to scripted movies and television productions, not because studios and networks had taken the moral high ground, but because documentaries historically did not garner high enough TV ratings or pull in large enough audiences to theaters to make it profitable to produce them.Streaming has changed all that. It’s a bottomless pit, in constant need of content, the cheaper and the more likely to attract audiences the better. Unscripted programming, in particular documentaries, fits the bill perfectly.Lost in all of this are the victims’ families, who not only stand to be retraumatized by the documentary series but will also see the family of the alleged killer, as well as their attorneys, reportedly being paid large sums of money. They also worry, with justification, that the documentary series might affect the trial.NBCUniversal and its fellow media services should stop doing such programming out of a sense of decency, but obviously won’t. It’s up to viewers to give them a reason they’ll immediately understand: Stop tuning in.Greg JosephSun City, Ariz.The writer is a retired television critic.This article appeared in print on page A27."
