Canadian groups were directed to a CSSB online survey portal, but the replies were not published individually but instead were aggregated(https://ifrs-springapps-comment-letter-api-1.azuremicroservices.io/v2/download-file?path=624_67209_Canadian-Sustainability-Standards-Board_0_CSSB-response-to-RFI-Consultation-on-Agenda-Priorities.pdf) and interpreted by the CSSB. The Canadian board appears to act more as a filter or gatekeeper in the process. The CSSB chair and board members, drawn primarily from accounting, are appointed by a committee of regulators, sustainability experts and other accountants and so may be unaccustomed to open and thorough-going consultation.The CSSB's lack of transparency is in stark contrast to practices in the United Kingdom. In its consideration of the ISSB standards, it has opened a broad consultation, or \"request for evidence(https://www.frc.org.uk/uk-sustainability-disclosure-tac),\" on: how (or if) the ISSB standards could be implemented in the U.K.; whether they will generate benefits commensurate with their costs; how technically feasible their preparation may or may not be; and what changes might be needed to adapt them to the U.K. economic context. Canada may have promised this level of detail but so far has failed to deliver.Growing green deal opposition is not 'populism'(https://financialpost.com/opinion/growing-green-deal-opposition-not-populism)Opinion: China needs to pay a higher price for its coal plants(https://financialpost.com/opinion/china-pay-higher-price-coal-plants)Terence Corcoran: Let's clean up the Kleenex grocery myths(https://financialpost.com/opinion/lets-clean-up-kleenex-grocery-myths)The standards that are coming are not just another set of accounting rules that ought to be left to accountants to decide. They are intended to completely transform how all Canadian businesses operate, and the substantial impacts they will have on costs will be passed on to consumers. Though the standards will raise all industries' costs, their coming at a time when Canadians already face substantial inflation of food prices is a special concern. Widespread new costs should not be imposed on the economy without discussion or debate. We need a much more thorough discussion than has been conducted so far.Tammy Nemeth is a U.K.-based energy analyst. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved."
