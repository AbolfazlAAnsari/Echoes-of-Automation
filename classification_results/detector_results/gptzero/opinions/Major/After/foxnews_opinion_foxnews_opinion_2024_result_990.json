In fact, somewhereJoseph Robinette Biden Jr.is almost certainly saying the same as he scoops himself an extra serving of chocolate chip ice cream.From a botched border visit tothe Michigan primaryto the reappearance of Hunter, the week was anything but smooth for the White House. And itâ€™s unlikely to get any better anytime soon.Here are the top takeaways from President Bidenâ€™s wild week:President Biden delivers remarks about immigration and border security at the Brownsville Station on Feb. 29, 2024 in Olmito, Texas.(Cheney Orr/Getty Images)The Border Continues to Bedevil BidenDemocrats are desperately trying to get on offense when it comes to immigration and border security. Sensing a real vulnerability, the White House hastily arranged an official trip on the very same dayformer President Trumpwas set to make his.BIDEN SAYS AMERICANS WILL BE LIVING IN A â€˜NIGHTMAREâ€™ IF TRUMP WINS RE-ELECTIONA competent political organization would use the trip and its backdrop to announce something: new money for the wall, additional border security forces, tightening of administration asylum policy. Something. Anything. To at least make it seem like theyâ€™re trying.Instead, Biden got to the border and doddered around. Saying nothing and doing even less. When asked what he could do to fix the mess, he blamed Republican and claimed he was helpless.Despite what the White House claims,Biden doesnâ€™t need a lawto fix the issues at the border. The idea that heâ€™s unable to do anything on his own is just plain wrong.There are executive orders aplenty that can make this situation better. He can restart the Remain in Mexico policy. He can also reinstall the emergency declaration he ended on his first day in office that will allow a large pot of money to help staunch the flow of migrants.He can even do smaller things to show heâ€™s taking action. Maybe thatâ€™s getting on the phone and play hardball with the countries allowing the surge of migrants through their own borders en route to ours? Maybe that means shaking up your team handling this, including Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas?WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL BOARD SAYS BIDEN SHOULD IGNORE LIBERAL â€˜WISH LISTS,â€™ SECURE BORDER TO BEAT TRUMPIâ€™ve rattled more ideas off in the last 30 seconds than they have in the last three years.From 2008 until about 2019,border apprehensions averagedabout 400,000 a yearBidenâ€™s first full year in office they shot up to 1.6 million and have not been below that since.And letâ€™s remember, for years his team insisted the border was secure. They refused to acknowledge anything other than that. Now, at the drop of a hat, itâ€™s a crisis that warrants passing a massive bill through a divided Congress â€” particularly a House of Representative with a narrow majority. And without it, thereâ€™s nothing President Biden can do.Wrong.THE WHITE HOUSE'S OPEN BORDER POLICIES COULD COST THEM THE 2024 ELECTIONMissed Opportunity in MichiganFar from the southern border, another crisis reared its head for the Biden campaign. This time in Michigan.An organized band of far-left activists, unhappy with Bidenâ€™s support of Israel, started a campaign tovote \"uncommitted\" in Tuesdayâ€™s primary. The effort outperformed expectations, gaining over 13% of the vote and delivering a repudiation of the president by his own party.Iâ€™ll be the first to say itâ€™s easy to sit and pout when itâ€™s February or March. There are no stakes and the only consequences are embarrassing a president whom many on the left donâ€™t really like that much.I have a hard time believing the far-left activists who spent much of the last decade in resistance marches against Donald Trump will look at the choice between Biden and Trump in early November and stay home.However, on a tactical level, this was an important test for the Biden campaign. Michigan is a must-win state for them this fall. Period.â€˜LISTEN TO MICHIGANâ€™ PROTESTERS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS, SEND MESSAGE TO BIDEN IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATETuesdayâ€™s primary was the chance to stresstest their political organization. Can they get their own supporters out in force and beat back what was quickly becoming an embarrassment for the president?The answer is well, no.They better hope they fix it before November.Hunter is BackAny day where Hunter Biden is making news is not a good day for the Biden campaign.In an exclusive interview on Monday, Hunter toldÂ Axios \"we are in the middle of a fight for the future of democracy.\" They went on to report that he \"sees his sobriety as crucialnot only to his life but also to ensuring Donald Trump doesn't become president again.\" On a human level, I genuinely hope he stays sober and healthy.Itâ€™s also patently absurd to view oneâ€™s sobriety as determining the very fate of democracy in this country.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONSo yet again, Hunter comes out of the woodwork with a self-delusional statement that turns the spotlight away from the White Houseâ€™s message and onto himself.Somewhere a White House communications staffer is putting their fist through a wall.You Ainâ€™t Seen Nothing YetIf you thought last week was wild, just wait. This week is poised to be even wilder.Super Tuesday will awardscores of delegates from Maine to California, while Thursday night will bring together the president, Congress, the Cabinet, the Supreme Court, and other leaders under one roof for the State of the Union. And who knows what else will be mixed in that we donâ€™t expect.All I can say is: Buckle up.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MATT GORMANMatt Gorman is a vice president at Targeted Victory, a Washington D.C.-based public affairs and digital marketing firm.
