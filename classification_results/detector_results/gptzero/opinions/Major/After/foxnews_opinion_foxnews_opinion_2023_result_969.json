Trump will be a dictator! Trump will destroy the Constitution! Trump will execute his political opponents! (Yes â€“ loony Joe Scarborough actually said that.)Andâ€¦Trump will destroy democracy, the central theme ofJoe Bidenâ€™s campaign.Not since theGrinch stole Christmashas anyone been so hysterically vilified. The establishment media is spewing out Trump alarmism at warpspeed. The Atlantic recently published an entire special issue, featuring more than twenty pieces on \"how a second term could shatter norms with the courts, education, the military, foreign policy, immigration, abortion rights, science, gender\", according to the magazine.Why this sudden surge in scaremongering? Three reasons:On that last point â€“ remember that in 2016Hillary Clintonâ€™s team, when they werenâ€™t conjuring up fake news about Trump colluding with Russia, pushed a narrative that had Americans quaking in their Uggs. In his first year in office, they predicted, Trump would plunge the country into recession and cause a stock market crash! He would ignite World War III! He was going to deport 11 million illegal immigrants and terminate equal rights for women! Heâ€™d give Europe to Putin and bring back torture!POLL SHOWS BIDEN HITTING RECORD LOW APPROVALS, FALLING BEHIND AGAINST TRUMP IN 2024 MATCHUPOf course, Trump did none of those things. Instead, he helped pass a massive tax overhaul, put Neil Gorsuch on the court, began dismantling President Obamaâ€™s suffocating regulatory excesses and drove down illegal immigration. Most consequential, he put China and the rest of the world on notice that the U.S. was not to be trifled with. How? By bombing Syria during a dinner withChina's President Xiat Mar-al-Lago; over what Trump described as a \"beautiful piece of chocolate cake,\" he stunned the Chinese dictator by announcing the surprise attack. That set the tone.In 2016, voters tuned out the alarmist talk and elected Trump over Hillary Clinton. That didnâ€™t prevent Biden from resorting to the same line of attack in 2020; this time it worked, which is why theyâ€™re going there again.'DEEP, DEEP TROUBLE': DEMS REPORTEDLY BRINGING IN HILLARY CLINTON TO HELP WITH BIDEN'S RE-ELECTIONThe second reason for turning up the Trump hysteria is that Biden has nothing else to sell. He haspitched Bidenomics incessantly, only to find his boasts falling flat with the 60% of voters who disapprove of his handling of the economy. Rumor is that the White House is backing off the term, and who can blame them? Personalizing big spending, big government and big inflation seems beyond stupid.Biden also proudly touts his climate agenda, which is becoming less popular by the day.Vice President Kamala Harriswas recently at COP28 in Abu Dhabi and bragged that the Biden White House has committed $1 trillion to climate initiatives. For those voters not keeping track, that must have been a head-turner.Some might wonder, where is that trillion dollars going? Where, indeed? One of the biggest objectives of the laughably titled Inflation Reduction Act was boosting take-up of electric vehicles by greatly expanding the number of charging outlets. Consulting firm McKinsey & Company predicts that \"The United States will need about 28 million ports by 2030 to meet the demand for electricity by zero-emission passenger vehicles,\" up from roughly 2.6 million today. It was recently reported thatnot a single charging station has been added since that bill passed sixteen months ago.DEMOCRATIC ANALYSTS SOUND ALARM ON MORE 'GRIM' BIDEN POLLING SHOWING DIMINISHING SUPPORT IN KEY VOTER GROUPSJohn Podesta, who ran Hillary Clintonâ€™s failed 2016 campaign, spearheaded Obamaâ€™s climate agenda and founded the left-wing Center for American Progress, was handed $370 billion in climate funds to distribute to various clean-energy groups; tracking which swing states and critical districts get those monies will be informative.Biden also claims to be building the economy from the middle out. He says heâ€™s bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., but the numbers say otherwise. In December 2019, before COVID blasted the U.S. economy, there were 12.9 million Americans working in manufacturing. Last month, that number had inched barely higher, to 13 million.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThe reality is, the GOP agenda for 2024 is bursting with opportunity. Theborder is truly a catastrophe. Millions are pouring into our country illegally and the president is inert. Horrific fentanyl deaths, drug gangs terrorizing border communities, unknown numbers of terrorists sneaking across the borderâ€¦ and Biden is unwilling to change policies even though the calamity is dragging down his approval numbers and angering even die-hard Democrats in blue cities and states. The White House has repeatedly stiffed Eric Adams, New York City mayor, who has appealed for help as our greatest city hovers on fiscal crisis.To what end? Who is cheering on massive illegal immigration? Itâ€™s not Hispanics â€“ polling shows they oppose the influx. It is the progressive wing of the Democratic Party that is pulling the levers, which says a great deal about Joe Bidenâ€™s tenuous grasp on the Oval Office.Which brings us to the last point. Democrats are increasingly terrified thatDonald Trump could winin 2024. A new Wall Street Journal poll puts Trump ahead of Biden by 4 points and by an even greater margin if third-party candidates are in the mix.In 2020, Trump was rarely ahead, but today is very different. Voters now know what a Joe Biden presidency looks like, and they donâ€™t like it. Trump wins on nearly every issue â€“ inflation, crime, securing the border and theIsrael-Hamaswar.In the last race, Biden hid in his basement, under cover of the pandemic; the public consequently did not see how he had aged. The stumbles and mumbles are now daily embarrassments; it wonâ€™t get better. In addition, the president has been credibly accused of corruption and has lied endlessly about his involvement withhis sonâ€™s business activities. Even if the charges never lead to impeachment, the image of Biden as the upright, honest statesman is gone.Democrats fear a Trump-Biden rematch. Their over-the-top attacks on President Trump show just how scared they are.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEKGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
