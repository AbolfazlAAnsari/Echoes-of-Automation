Its founder Gavin MacInnes, a British-born Canadian grievance-monger andco-founder of Vice Media, created a group defined by brazen nationalism, misogyny and aggressive opposition to \"Antifa\" socialists, the Black Lives Matter Movement and Muslims, among others. Key to the Proud Boys' expansion has been an agility to publicly position their \"fraternity\" around an array of rotating grievances and associated scapegoats.AJanuary 2022 research paperfrom the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland noted that, \"While the Proud Boys vehemently deny adhering to a racist ideology, the organization is deeply rooted in white nationalism and misogyny.\"The Huffington Post editor and author of the new book,\"We Are Proud Boys,\"Andy Campbell further explains the group's seeming contradictions regarding race:\"In the Proud Boys' early days, founder Gavin McInnes made his views on white supremacy in the group very clear: Anyone can join up, so long as they generally agree that white men were overwhelmingly responsible for the success of Western culture,\" he wrote in an email.\"While the Proud Boys have white supremacy and bigotry at their core, all of them gather under the banner of political violence in service of the right-wing grievance machine, and that makes for some strange bedfellows.\"One of the group's key initiation rituals involves a member reading this declaration in public and at meetings before being pummeled by five of their peers: \"I am a proud western chauvinist who refuses to apologize for creating the modern world.\"The Proud Boys' guidebook \"disavows\" Nazis and racists, but since the group's inception it has routinely marched alongside a who's who of American extremists, including neo-Nazis and Oath Keepers, at violent public events includinganti-Shariahandanti-immigrantprotests - and the January 6 insurrection. And although the group nominally accepts different races, the guidebook is unrelentingly clear about its rigid Euro-supremacy and anti-multicultural stance, calling for its members to \"recognize the West is the best.\"Violence was not merely a buzzword, buthas been a key part of the group's existence. According to the University of Maryland's START program,83 Proud Boys and associateshave carried out ideological attacks, including 54 defendants involved in January 6 rioting alone. Based on charges filed, that's the largest numberfrom any extremist groupwhose members have been identified at the US Capitol that day.Tarrio's charges connected to the insurrection are not the first time he faced charges in the nation's capital;  he pleaded guilty to a weapons charge and thedestruction of a Black Lives Matter bannerfrom the historic Asbury United Methodist Church in December 2020.And while criminality and machismo have characterized Tarrio's leadership, they also created the very power vacuum that led to his ascension to chairman.In November 2018,MacInnes resigned from the group. \"I am officially disassociating myself from the Proud Boys,\" he said in a YouTube video. \"In all capacities, forever, I quit.\" His decision came amid a number of swirling controversies - the previous month,nine Proud Boys were arrestedafter fighting broke out outside a venue in New York City where MacInnes spoke. Video footage later emerged of some of the group's members saying homophobic slurswhile beating a man on the ground.And just days prior,a damning law enforcement documentbecame public that stated, \"Proud Boys members have contributed to the recent escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses, and in cities like Charlottesville, Virginia, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington.\"Soon thereafter, Tarrio assumed the reins of power.Tarrio's leadership has been marked by a dramatic escalation of violence employed by the group. And of the37 \"violent demonstration events\"identified by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a non-profit research center, as including the Proud Boys' participation during 2020, 25 occurred between the presidential election and President Joe Biden's inauguration, often aligned with broader \"Stop the Steal\" protests and campaigns.(The group's notoriety had grown further in September 2020 when then-President Donald Trump addressed them during a presidential debate: \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by,\"Trump said. \"But I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem.\")Tarrio's slalom down a hill of violence, misogyny and race-baiting, however, may have come to an end, as a jury ponders his role and those that he led in the worst attack on the nation's Capitol in over a century and one half.Opinion by Brian LevinTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
