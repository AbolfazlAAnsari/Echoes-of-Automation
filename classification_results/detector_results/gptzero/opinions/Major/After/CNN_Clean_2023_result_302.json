Republicans who aren't willing to back Trump will have a number of choices in the primaries, from former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley to likely candidatesSen. Tim Scott,former Vice President Mike PenceandFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis.Third-party candidacies do not have much of a record of winning, but they can have an impact - including undercutting one of the major candidates. In 1912, former President Theodore Roosevelt ran with the Progressive Party, splitting the Republican vote, which helped Democrat Woodrow Wilson win.In 1968, former Alabama Gov.George Wallace, the poster boy for Southern opposition to civil rights and the voice of conservative populist rage, won over enough disaffected Democrats through the American Independent Party tobolsterRepublican nominee Richard Nixon to the White House.In 1992, Ross Perot ran as the Reform Party's candidate and won more than 18% of the vote. Many experts believe that he took a big bite out of President George H.W. Bush's campaignby offeringan alternative for conservatives who liked his populist bent, emphasis on deficit reduction and his attacks on Washington. In 2000, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader famously won enoughvotes in Floridato narrow Vice President Al Gore's total and open the door to a heated recount that culminated with the victory of George W. Bush. In 2016, Democratsblamedthird-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein for helping elect Trump.Not all third-party candidacies are equal. Others are more symbolic. When South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond left the Democratic Party in 1948 andran for president as a Dixiecrat in response tothen-Sen. candidate Hubert Humphreytelling supportersof states' rights that it was time to join the struggle for civil rights, Thurmond solidified a pathway for the transformation of the South from a region dominated by the Democrats to one where Republicans, capitalizing on the resistance to desegregation and the civil rights movement, established a stronghold that lasts today. Democrat Harry Truman still won reelection against Republican Thomas Dewey, but Thurmond'svictoriesin Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina and Louisiana marked a key moment in the shift of party loyalty.Of course, there are also plenty of third-party campaigns that don't have much consequence. In 1996, Perot's second run was far less significant. President Bill Clinton had enough of a lead over the Republican nominee, Sen. Bob Dole, that it made Perot's third-party candidacy seem meaningless. There have also been the endless efforts by candidates such as Lyndon LaRouche that are more curiosities than anything serious.A Manchin run would have the potential to fall into the first category, taking away enough votes from his current Democratic Party to make it easier for the GOP to succeed. Since we live in an era of narrow elections, where landslides like 1936, 1972 or 1984 are extremely rare, all that Manchin would need to do would be to take enough votes from a handful of voters within a handful of states to have a dramatic impact. He could easily become the Ralph Nader of 2024. Should Manchin decide to step into the 2024 race, he might very well end up handing the keys to Trump to finish what the former president couldn't complete in his tumultuous first term.Opinion by Julian ZelizerTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
