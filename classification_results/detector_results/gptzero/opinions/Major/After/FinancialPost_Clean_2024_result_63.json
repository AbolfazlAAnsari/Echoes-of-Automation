But in what may be a watershed moment for housing policy worldwide, New Zealand's recently elected coalition government is giving up on densification and instead, with its Going for Housing Growth(https://www.national.org.nz/housinggrowth) program, is aiming at the heart of the issue by addressing the cost of land.Under new proposals, local governments will be required to zone enough land for 30 years of projected growth and make it available for immediate development. According to the government, local governments' deliberate decision to restrain growth on their fringes has \"driven up the price of land, which has flowed through to house prices,\" and it cites research indicating that \"urban growth boundaries add NZ$600,000 (C$500,000) to the cost of land(https://media.umbraco.io/te-waihanga-30-year-strategy/rmugllsi/urban-land-prices.pdf) for houses in Auckland's fringes.\"The new policy will rely on a 2020 act allowing public agencies and private developers to establish \"Special Purpose Vehicles\" - corporations established for financing housing-related infrastructure, with the costs to be repaid by homeowners over up to 50 years. This removes the infrastructure burden from governments, as has also been done in \"municipal utility districts\" (MUDs) in Texas and Colorado. MUDs are independent entities empowered to issue bonds and collect fees to finance and manage local infrastructure for new developments.New Zealand's government believes guaranteeing plentiful access to land will result in an increased supply \"inside and at the edge of our cities ... so that land prices are not inflated by artificial planning restrictions.\" The same strategy could help here. Unlike most urban planners, most Canadians do not want higher population density. A 2019 survey of younger Canadian households by the Mustel Group and Sotheby's(https://www.newgeography.com/content/006189-canadian-families-denied-preferred-detached-houses-forced-condos-survey) found that on average across four metropolitan areas (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary) 83 per cent of such families preferred detached houses, though only 56 per cent had actually bought one.Households that move from the big city to Kitchener-Waterloo, say, or Chilliwack not only want to save money, they also want more house and probably a yard. Detached housing predominates in these affordability sanctuaries, compared to the Vancouver and Toronto CMAs.With Ottawa doing everything, who needs provinces anymore?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/ottawa-doing-everything-who-needs-provinces-anymore)BoC's Carolyn Rogers is right. Weak productivity is a national crisis(https://financialpost.com/opinion/bank-of-canada-carolyn-rogers-right-weak-productivity-national-crisis)If Ottawa is counting on CCS, it should start acting that way(https://financialpost.com/opinion/ottawa-counting-ccs-start-acting-that-way)Urban planners continue to complain about urban expansion(https://www.greaterauckland.org.nz/2023/05/29/nationals-housing-policy-backtrack/), but that is how organic urban growth occurs. Toronto and Vancouver show that the cost of taming expansion is unacceptably high: inflated house prices, higher rents and, for increasing numbers of people, poverty. It is time to prioritize the well-being of Canadian households, not urban planners.Financial PostWendell Cox, a senior fellow at the Frontier Centre for Public Policy(http://fcpp.org/ ), is author of the Centre's annual Demographia International Housing Affordability(https://fcpp.org/2023/10/11/new-report-highlights-housing-affordability-challenges-across-canada/) report.Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the business news you need to know - add financialpost.com(https://financialpost.com/ ) to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here(https://financialpost.com/newsletters/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2024 Postmedia Network Inc.
