Hunter received millions of dollars from foreign companies, governments and foreign government-controlled entities, often involving regimes that are distinctly unfriendly to the United States, such as China and Russia.A normal special counsel investigation would delve into possible influence peddling, improper lobbying and the possible routing of funds to Joe Biden and the Biden family. This is the only way that Weiss can recover his reputation after, either intentionally or incompetently, he allowed the statutes of limitations to expire on Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) and tax charges against Hunter from 2014-2016, when his father was vice-president.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONIf DOJ does conduct a full investigation, they may well uncover the type of corruption that the DOJ prosecutes under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) all the time – bribing important government officials by paying off their relatives.It is also possible that Abbe Lowell and his team will negotiate a nice plea deal for Hunter on the tax charges – it’s always possible up until the moment the jury reads its verdict – but even then, the handgun convictions means that any plea deal cannot be as lenient as it could have been last year.Finally, Hunter’s cases exacerbate the Democrats’ \"lawfare.\" Weiss’ office initially avoided charging and prosecuting Hunter for the gun, tax or FARA crimes, and allowed the charges that would have most directly implicated President Joe Biden to expire.Democrats, who claim to re-establish \"norms,\" instead set the precedent that overly partisan and aggressive local prosecutors can use prosecution to target political opponents – even a former president of the United States or the current opposition candidate for the highest office in the land. Partisan advantage or revenge never should be a motive for impeachment or criminal proceedings.Prosecutors would do well to remember then Attorney General Robert Jackson’s speech warning that prosecutors should beware of \"picking the man and then searching the law books, or putting investigators to work, to pin some offense on him... the prosecutor picks some person whom he dislikes or desires to embarrass, or selects some group of unpopular persons and then looks for an offense, that the greatest danger of abuse of prosecuting power lies.\" His words are as wise now as they were then.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JOHN YOOCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JOHN SHUJohn Shu is a legal scholar and commentator who served in the administrations of Presidents George H.
