            "inputText": "By Aleck Dadson and Ed WaitzerWho gets to decide the direction of energy policy in Ontario? The Ontario government itself, led by the minister of energy? Or the specialized regulatory agencies that adjudicate rate setting and establish rules about more technical issues? Or is it the task of both?Those questions arose in stark relief just before Christmas when a panel of the Ontario Energy Board voted(https://toronto.citynews.ca/2023/12/22/minister-to-overrule-ontario-energy-board/#:~:text=Energy%20Minister%20Todd%20Smith%20said,he%20said%20in%20an%20interview. ) 2-1 that from now on Enbridge will have to charge developers upfront for the cost of building-out projects using natural gas, rather than follow the long-standing policy of amortizing the cost over the life of the project. The panel's concern? As the two-person majority wrote, \"The OEB is not satisfied that Enbridge Gas's proposal will not lead to an overbuilt, under-utilized gas system in the face of the energy transition.\" The panel feels a strong price signal upfront is needed to warn developers off investment in what might become stranded infrastructure if a wholesale switchover to heat pumps and electricity eventually takes place.Of course, a steeper upfront cost might also mean higher building costs just as governments are trying to encourage housing development in order to deal with a perceived housing crisis. It was therefore not surprising that the panel decision met with a stern public rebuke by Minister of Energy Todd Smith, who accused the panel of straying \"out of their lane\" and in effect making provincial energy policy. He committed to reversing the decision with legislation to \"keep shovels in the ground\" building new housing.Though the panel may have been frustrated by a lack of policy direction, Smith's annoyance was also understandable. His ministry was just days away from releasing a report from its own \"Electrification and Energy Transition Panel(https://www.ontario.ca/page/electrification-and-energy-transition-panel)\" (EETP) that includes specific recommendations about the need for policy direction from the ministry on the role of natural gas in Ontario's future energy system, including the cost of gas connections and infrastructure investment, the very issues into which the OEB panel had strayed without direction.Who's right? Who should do what? And what lessons can be learned from this dust-up? The answer starts with understanding the roles and responsibilities of the government and its agencies and the need for co-ordination. Such co-ordination was the hallmark of past transformative initiatives in the Ontario energy sector - the restructuring of Ontario Hydro and the distribution sector in the late 1990's and the implementation of the Green Energy Plan almost 15 years ago. The ETTP is right to emphasize the need for even stronger co-ordination going forward.During periods of transformational change, the relationship with government is particularly sensitive for tribunals like the OEB, whose mandate includes adjudication. In our view, adjudicators should focus on deciding specific matters in a transparent, fair and non-partisan manner. They should do so by applying a legal and regulatory framework to findings based on evidence and arguments presented in an adversarial process. And they should avoid trying to resolve complex policy issues, in which any decision will affect unrepresented stakeholders and other areas of concern. In short, adjudicative panels shouldn't stray.That said, pivoting from adjudicative to policy-making modes is not that uncommon for regulatory agencies. And there are ways of dealing with it that don't require public ministerial intervention. The OEB could have initiated its own review of the panel's decision - sticking with the existing policy on the amortization of connection costs for now and deferring consideration of any changes pending ministerial direction or a wider consultation by the OEB itself. Internal protocols, such as peer review of draft decisions, can serve as a check against error by adjudicators and should also be strengthened. And there should be clearer guidance about the types of issues that need to be left to government or to broader consultations.Other checks are found in the existing Memorandum of Understanding(https://www.oeb.ca/about-oeb/corporate-governance-and-reports/memorandum-understanding) (MoU) between the ministry and the OEB. It describes how the minister is responsible for developing policy priorities and direction and what the OEB's role is in implementing those policies and programs. It stresses the need for timely communication between the two. Excluding the amortization issue from adjudication might have permitted a more open dialogue about how best to address it as part of the energy transition the ministry agrees is coming.One thing currently missing from the MoU is a dispute resolution process. A comparable framework agreement(https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/sites/default/files/docs/2019/12/framework_document_final_publication_version_december_2019.pdf) between the U.K. government and its energy regulator calls for \"a pragmatic and issue-based approach\" to resolving disputes in a manner that is timely, limits potential disruption and provides an opportunity for the parties to \"learn the lessons\" from the dispute. Similar language should be included in the OEB's MoU.Road to economic freedom has not yet been paved(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-milei-lays-out-the-theory-but-the-road-to-economic-freedom-has-not-been-paved)Good luck getting Ottawa's consulting under control(https://financialpost.com/opinion/get-ottawa-consulting-under-control-good-luck)Democracy is best (even if it's Trump vs. Biden)(https://financialpost.com/opinion/warts-democracy-still-best-trump-vs-biden)Enbridge has now appealed(https://www.thecanadianpressnews.ca/politics/enbridge-appealing-ontario-energy-board-ruling-on-natural-gas-costs/article_0d57f2a6-3155-5026-baec-1b489e5b03ee.html) the OEB panel's decision to the Ontario courts. All the more reason to hope the OEB and the ministry can \"learn the lessons\" here - first, by fine-tuning existing checks and balances to help avoid future conflicts and, second, by resolving the amortization issue in a way that respects both the government's responsibility to set the policy framework and the expertise the OEB should contribute.Aleck Dadson, former COO of the Ontario Energy Board, is a senior adviser at StrategyCorp.
