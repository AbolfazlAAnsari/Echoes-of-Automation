Lewis, himself a great expertin mythic literature, explained, \"those who think that the Gospels are myths, haven’t read many myths.\"One of the most powerful arguments for the authenticity of the resurrection is the emergence of Christianity precisely as a messianic movement. There is no question that the first witnesses proclaimed, simultaneously, that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah of Israel and that was indeed put to death on a Roman cross.The puzzle is that, within an ancient Jewish context, there would have been no surer indicator that someone wasnotthe Messiah than his death at the hands of his enemies, for the Messiah was expected to deal with the foes of the nations and to reign as King.EASTER IS GOD REMINDING US OF THIS ONE LIFE-CHANGING THINGAnd yet St. Paul, who spoke over and again of the Lordship of Jesus the Messiah, could also say, \"I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.\"How could any of this make sense unlessthe crucified Jesushad been, through the power of God, raised from death? Moreover, Paul, Peter, James, Thomas, Bartholomew and practically all of the major evangelists of that first generation went to their deaths proclaiming the fact of the resurrection, their blood functioning as an even more eloquent witness than their words.Having established the reality of the resurrection, what can we say about its meaning?The basic significance of Easter, still massively relevant today, is that God’s love is more powerful than anything that is in the world. The greatest political, cultural and military force in Jesus’ time was the empire of Rome, and the fiercest means the Romans had to cow people into obedience was the cross.EASTER SUNDAY IS A CHANCE TO OVERCOME HUMAN DOUBT, AS THIS APOSTLE DID, SAYS KANSAS PASTOROn Good Friday, Jesus by all appearances was just one more in a long line of hapless victims of Roman tyranny. So when God raised Jesus from the dead, his followers knew thatRome had been dethronedand that, in principle, any tyranny whose power was based upon the fear of death, was put on notice.When they declared Jesus as Lord, they were implying that Caesar was no longer Lord. That the Roman authorities didn’t miss this message is clear from the fact that most of the first evangelists ended up imprisoned or put to death.The Church, up and down the ages, has had the same basic task: to declare the Lordship of Jesus. And when the Church is faithful to this charge, she still causes the tyrants of the world to tremble.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONIf you want to see an excellent example of this principle in action, remember whatPope John Paul IIaccomplished in the Communist Poland of the late 1970s. Backed by no army, possessing no weapons, but speaking clearly and boldly of God, of human rights, and of Jesus the risen Lord, he set in motion the dissolution of the Soviet empire.So, Easter is not a bland springtime festival, nor a foggy myth; it is an earthquake, a revolution, the best possible news.Word on Fire founder Bishop Robert Barron is bishop of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester (Minnesota) and an acclaimed author, speaker, and theologian.
