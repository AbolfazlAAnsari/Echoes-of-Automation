Overall, though, I guess the majority of members are content with the way the buildings and land are run and protected. On my visits, I’ve not felt I’ve been talked down to or lectured. The volunteer staff have been keen to explain things and answer questions. It’s good to see children being allowed to explore, with less of the old “look, don’t touch” attitude.I’m interested in where the money came from to build and buy the estates and also how they held onto them, what investments were made, and how people, tenants and workers were treated. I don’t know what percentage of members bothered to vote at the last AGM, but I wonder if many thought that if the current approach is working, why risk changing it?Those who did vote had the choice to take the advice of the board or, like me, make up their own mind.You get what the majority vote for.Isn’t that the way democracy works?Dave ThomasBristol"
