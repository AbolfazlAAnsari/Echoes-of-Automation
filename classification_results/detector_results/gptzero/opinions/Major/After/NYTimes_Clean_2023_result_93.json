Most of the people in county jails are charged with nonviolent offenses, “guilty” of nothing more than having a substance use disorder, facing mental health challenges or living in poverty.While we must continue to call on policymakers to reform jails, we must also implement approaches that keep people out of them in the first place.We know that alternatives to incarceration work. People can remain in their communities while awaiting trial without posing a threat to others. Safe and stable housing, mental health and social services, and other interventions can prevent people from being arrested and ensure that they don’t repeat the cycle of incarceration.Conditions in jails must improve, but we must also address their overuse and misuse if our goal is safe and vibrant communities.Holly O’DonnellWashingtonThe writer is president and C.E.O. of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.President Biden, Please Show MercyTo the Editor:Re “Executions Across Globe Are Highest in Five Years” (news article, May 17):Amnesty International reports a rise in executions in the Middle East and North Africa, but not in the United States, where the 18 executions carried out last year were the lowest number since 1991 and public support for capital punishment appears to be ebbing.President Biden could consolidate this trend by using his clemency power to spare the lives of the43 men on federal death row.To show them mercy would emphasize the common humanity of president and prisoner. It would give practical expression to the language of dignity and rights that Mr. Biden espouses.All that is required to commute their sentences is a few strokes of the presidential pen to sign the necessary orders (and a dollop of moral courage).Why not, Mr. Biden?Ian O’DonnellGreystones, IrelandThe writer is a professor of criminology at University College Dublin and the author of “Justice, Mercy and Caprice: Clemency and the Death Penalty in Ireland.”Senator Feinstein, It’s Time to GoTo the Editor:Re “After So Many Years at the Levers of Power, a Struggle to Let Go” (Congressional memo, front page, May 20):As a decades-long constituent of and voter for Dianne Feinstein, I sadly find myself asking of her (as I did about Donald Trump most days of his presidency): In what other workplace would this be acceptable?Congress is a workplace, and as such those who work there should be held to the basic standards we have all had to meet on the job.Nancy FlaxmanNovato, Calif.This article appeared in print on page A23."
