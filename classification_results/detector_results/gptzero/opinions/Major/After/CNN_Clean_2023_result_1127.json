That's whyMoody'scalled out partisan polarization, saying: \"Continued political polarization within U.S. Congress raises the risk that successive governments will not be able to reach consensus on a fiscal plan to slow the decline in debt affordability.\"If you sincerely care about fiscal responsibility - reducing deficits and debt - work in a bipartisan way to reduce long-term costs and raise revenue.
