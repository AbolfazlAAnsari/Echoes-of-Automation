That's not what the speaker of the House should be saying.After receiving the speaker's gavel, McCarthy did havesome nice momentssuch as when he said to Jeffries, \"There will be times we will agree and many times we will differ. I promise that our debates will be passionate, but never personal.\"In closing, the speaker included these commendable lines: \"Our nation is worth fighting for. ... Our future is worth fighting for.\"But these are words without meaning, given McCarthy's track record of flip-flopping on key issues such as standing up to Trump over January 6 toremaining silentover the lies by new GOP Rep. George Santos, whose vote he desperately needed in the speakership battle.In his speech, Jeffries unapologetically defended American values and our democratic republic - if only we had a speaker who had the courage to do the same.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
