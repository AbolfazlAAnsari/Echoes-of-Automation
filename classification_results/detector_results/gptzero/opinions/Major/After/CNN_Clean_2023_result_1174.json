Thankfully, the attorneys for the plaintiffs have said they willappealthis part of the ruling to the Colorado Supreme Court.Putting aside the legal issue, we should all heed Wallace's warnings about how dangerous Trump is. As she wrote, \"Trump has consistently endorsed violence and intimidation as not only legitimate means of political expression, but as necessary, even virtuous.\" She added, alarmingly, that \"Trump was aware that his supporters were willing to engage in political violence and that they would respond to his calls for them to do so.\"The judge couldn't be more correct. Trump has a documentedhistoryof embracing violent rhetoric that has led his supporters to threaten or commit acts of violence, from his 2016 presidential campaignto today.But the court's findings are even more alarming against the backdrop of Trump's unhinged rhetoric in recent months, saying that he would serve as \"retribution\" against his perceived political enemies - some of whom he referred to as \"vermin.\" The former president also has made statements indicating that he might be poised, if he returns to the White House, toweaponizethe government against those who oppose him.Taken all together, this paints a deeply frightening portrait of a man who could be willing to use any means available - possibly including violence - to achieve his personal and political ends.Just as worrisome, Trump has defended those who have committed some of these violent acts. For example, Trump has repeatedlyslammedthe \"unfair\" prosecution of his supporters who waged the January 6 insurrection to prevent Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's victory, and hevowedto pardon a \"large portion of them.\" Trump's promise to pardon those who engaged in this attack could be seen as a message to his supporters that if they engage in future violence in his name to help him win in 2024, he would pardon them if elected president.All of this is why Trump's recent ratcheting up of dehumanizing rhetoric directed at those who oppose him is truly dangerous. Some of the most jarring comments include Trump at the March gathering of conservative activists at the CPAC convention when hetoldthe audience, \"for those who have been wronged and betrayed: I am your retribution.\"Later in that speech, Trumplistedhis political enemies, from Republicans in name only (presumably referring to the Republicans who do not support him) to \"globalists\" to what he called the \"fake news media.\" He then vowed that if he wins, \"we will liberate America from these villains and scoundrels once and for all.\"\"Retribution\" and \"liberation\" of the nation from political opponents is not something heard before in modern American politics - let alone from the person leading the 2024 field for the GOP presidential nomination.In recent weeks, Trump has become even more unhinged, irresponsiblytellinghis supporters that those who oppose him are \"vermin\" who \"lie and steal and cheat on elections.\" In that same speech,he addedthat \"the threat from outside forces is far less sinister, dangerous and grave than the threat from within.\"In other words, Trump is conditioning - or even arguably radicalizing - his supporters to believe that those who oppose Trump are \"vermin\" who must be \"liberated\" from our nation. This explains why experts such as historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat arewarningus that Trump is now employing language \"used effectively by Hitler and Mussolini to dehumanize people and encourage their followers to engage in violence.\"Wallace found that, though Trump engaged in a violent insurrection on Jan 6, 2021, she could not disqualify him from the ballot. Now nearly three years after that insurrection, today's Trump is even more desperate; he understands that the most effective way to remain out of prison (given he'sfacing 91 felony chargesin four jurisdictions) is to win in 2024.The situation is more than combustible - it very well could be the recipe for the downfall of American democracy as we know it.Opinion by Dean Obeidallah, CNNTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
