But this is a flawed and misleading way of looking at Canada's government indebtedness. When we dig further into the numbers, Canada's debt position isn't so enviable after all.The government's claim that Canada enjoys comparatively low levels of debt originates from an International Monetary Fund (IMF) database(https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2023/April/download-entire-database), as displayed on page 24 of the most recent federal budget(https://www.budget.canada.ca/2023/pdf/budget-2023-en.pdf). According to the IMF, Canada does indeed have the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio among the G7 countries (Germany, Italy, Japan, France, the United Kingdom and the United States).But the limited set of comparison countries appears to have been carefully selected. Extending the analysis to include a broader group of countries provides a more accurate assessment of Canada's comparative indebtedness. Among 29 OECD countries for which comparable data(https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?QueryId=51644) are available, Canada drops to 11th in 2023 when ranked by net debt as a share of the economy - no longer best, just middle of the pack.And there's a problem with \"net debt,\" the measure the government uses. Net debt is a narrow measure of indebtedness that subtracts financial assets from total government debt. The implicit assumption is that those assets could be used to offset debt. But the financial assets used to calculate Canada's net debt include those of the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans (CPP and QPP), which totalled(https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=1010001501) $654.7 billion as of last December 31st.The difference between Canada's gross debt and net debt, according to the IMF(https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2023/April/download-entire-database), is almost $2.6 trillion at the end of 2023. In other words, the value of net assets held in the CPP and QPP explains more than a quarter of the difference between Canada's gross and net debt.Why does this matter? The assets of the CPP and QPP are required to meet obligations(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/caution-required-when-comparing-canadas-debt-to-other-countries.pdf) for existing and future retirees, so they couldn't be used to offset government debt without compromising the two plans' ability to provide benefits to retirees.Desjardins Economics does offer a comparative analysis(https://financialpost.com/executive/executive-summary/7-myths-canada-government-debt-deficit-taxes) of net debt excluding pension assets among G7 countries. By this measure, Canada has the second lowest net debt-to-GDP in the G7. However, this is again flawed. Desjardins only looks at central government debt. In other words, it compares the indebtedness of Canada's federal government to the indebtedness of central governments in other countries. But while the U.K., France, Japan and Italy are all \"unitary\" states, Canada is a federal country where provinces have many constitutional powers (i.e., health care and education), spend a lot and have accumulated significant debt. Comparing the net debt of Canada's federal government to that of central governments in G7 countries is not an apples-to-apples comparison.A better measure of Canada's comparative indebtedness is to compare \"gross general government debt\" to GDP across countries. Gross debt, according to the IMF(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/caution-required-when-comparing-canadas-debt-to-other-countries.pdf), includes \"all liabilities that require future payment of interest and/or principal by the debtor to the creditor,\" while general government includes all levels of government.Canada's on the road again toward new bailouts with Volkswagen subsidy(https://financialpost.com/opinion/canada-new-bailouts-volkswagen-subsidy)After SVB's collapse, what to do about deposit insurance?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/svbs-collapse-what-to-do-deposit-insurance)Small business calls for back-to-work legislation for PSAC workers(https://financialpost.com/opinion/small-business-back-to-work-legislation-psac-workers)Using this measure, Canada falls(https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?QueryId=51644) from 11th among 29 OECD countries when net debt is measured to 20th.
