You would expect the reporting on such a dramatic a story that had written itself on national television would be sober, lucid and straightforward.But over at MSNBC, that simply was not going to happen. Credibility, integrity, and the aforementioned sanity be damned.Earlier this week, former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele, now a Trump-detesting MSNBC analyst, questioned on the air if Trump had even really been shot. Instead, he floated the conspiracy theory that the bullet hit a teleprompter, shattering the glass, and therefore Trump was only hit with glass and not an actual bullet.\"What about reports that it may not have been a bullet which wounded him but glass from the shattered teleprompter?\" Steele asked.In the same rant, Steele also demanded that Trump's medical reports immediately be released to prove that his ear actually had been hit by a bullet.Two days prior to Steele tossing out this theory, left-wing fact-check site Snopes had already debunked the teleprompter speculation, noting they were all intact after the incident. The network should've pulled Steele off the air for such irresponsible talk, but we've learned not to expect accountability from the Peacock.Joy Reid questioned Donald Trump's injuries on Wednesday in a post on Threads.((Photo by Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for ESSENCE)/Screenshot/Threads)Enter Joy Reid, a primetime host with a long and storied history of lies and deceit, as documentedhereandhereandherefor starters, decided to take this one step further by implying that the whole assassination attempt was actually staged and choreographed for Trump's political benefit.\"I have many questions! Like where are the medical reports?\" she wrote on X this week. \"What caused Trump’s injury, and what was the injury? Shrapnel? Glass? A bullet? Where were the three attendees who were shot seated or standing relative to Trump?\"\"Why was Trump allowed to stand and pose for photos?\" she also asked.You get where all this is going: They're saying that Trump was engaging in stolen valor. They're missing the point that even if Trump was \"only\" grazed by a bullet, he nearly died as a nation looked on.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONAnd they're obviously not asking the right questions. Here's a few, just in case they want to do some actual journalism:The fact that all these things are barely being discussed on this so-called news network is stunning, even for MSNBC.It's no secret that many MSNBCers are infected with an incurable strain of Trump Derangement Syndrome, and have been since he announced his first run for the presidency in 2015. Their hatred has become so blinding that, amid one of the biggest stories of our lifetime, they have decided to sacrifice their own integrity and honesty for the cause of taking down Trump in November.MSNBC should finally tell the truth and call itself \"The Place to Lean Forward Into Conspiracy Theories,\" now... and for the foreseeable future.CLICK FOR MORE FROM JOE CONCHAJoe Concha is a FOX News contributor who joined the network in 2020.
