Consumers who didn't get their paychecks shouldn't have to pay any financial penalties. If anyone should incur a financial burden from this error, it should be the entities responsible for this debacle.Some banks say they'll try to help affected individuals. JPMorgan Chasesaidit would \"work to refund overdraft fees caused by this.\" That's better than nothing. But the banks shouldn't impose those fees in the first place. The onus should not be on consumers to make sure financial institutions don't unfairly charge them. Congress has beenworking on legislationto protect Americans from predatory overdraft fees, but as of now, none of those bills has passed.Even little glitches such as this affect a lot of people. What about when a major snafu happens? We're more susceptible to them as banks rely more on technology. For example, ACH transactions rely onspecially formatted National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) filescontaining instructions for a bank to transfer funds between accounts. Errors in NACHA files can cause ACH payment rejections and disrupt the seamless flow of transactions.The finance sector has changed a lot over the past dozen years, via consolidation and new technology. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)announced on Tuesdaya new proposal to help customers avoid problems with larger fintech businesses that offer services such as digital wallets and payment apps. The CFPB noted, \"Despite their impact on consumer finance, Big Tech and other nonbank companies operating in the payments sphere do not receive the same regulatory scrutiny and oversight as banks and credit unions.\"Since it opened in 2011 in response to the banking-fueled economic meltdown that sparked the Great Recession, the CFPB hasrecouped$17.5 billion for consumers and processed 4 million consumer complaints against companies. But its ability to protect consumers could be short-lived if the payday lending industry has its way. The US Supreme Court heard oral arguments on October 3 in CFPB v. Community Financial Services Association of America, a crucialcasethat will determine thefuture of the CFPB's funding.Because the CFPB's funding structure aligns with the Constitution'sAppropriations Clause, the bureau has a strong legal argument that should lead the Supreme Court to vote in its favor, and I encourage that. Stripped of dependable funding, the CFPB would be hamstrung in protecting consumers.While this ACH incident does not appear to have spread further, it's just a matter of time until another one happens. In this case, the CFPB should demand that businesses don't double-whammy anyone who missed a paycheck through no fault of their own with any sort of late or overdraft fee. Moving forward, the bureau should follow through on its newest proposal to keep the financial industry in check. American consumers are counting on it.Opinion by Ed MierzwinskiTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
