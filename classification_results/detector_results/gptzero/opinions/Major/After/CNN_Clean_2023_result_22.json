Because while China's threats to \"reunify\"Taiwanwith the mainland and its alliance with Russia have brought the US and our East Asian friends (Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) together, trade is pushing us apart.Much of this goes back to then-President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the US from theTrans-Pacific Partnership(TPP) back in January of 2017, which stunnedJapan. After all, the strategic impetus behind theTPPwas to allow the US, and not China, to set the trade rules for the Indo-Pacific region.The US's withdrawal raised questions about its commitment to Asia. In the absence of US leadership, the then-Japanese Prime Minister, the late Shinzo Abe, helped the remaining 11 nations that were part of the TPP come together to form its replacement, theComprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership(CPTPP). Still, as recently as last May, during a meeting with Biden, Kishida urged the US to return to theTPP.The Biden administration has made some movement toward re-engaging in trade talks in Asia. At that same May meeting, Biden launched theIndo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity(IPEF).

Moreover, the IPEF excludes Taiwan, likely in deference to the other Asian members that feared angeringChina.The Biden administration, from its early days in office, showed little interest in pursuing traditional free trade deals.
