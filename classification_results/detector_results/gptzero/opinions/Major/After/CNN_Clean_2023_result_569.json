Liberals are 14 percentage points more likely than conservatives to treat a candidate's position on abortion as a litmus test, up from a four-point difference last January.But there are clear obstacles for Democrats to translate popular support for abortion rights into wins on Election Day.First, there are the structural disadvantages consistently plaguing the party. The Senate is structured tooverrepresent small stateswhere Republicans have anadvantage.

It's one thing to turn voters out for abortion when a single initiative will decide a great deal about access in a state. It's another to be motivated to vote for a candidate when it's unclear what kind of tangible difference they could make, and there are other issues at play.That means Democrats have to think hard about how to message the abortion issue. That will require focus not just on what Democrats would like to do in an ideal world - steps that are unlikely to work given the Senate map in 2024 favors the GOP and the structural disadvantages the party faces.It will require Democrats to lay out what Republican control could mean for abortion access - federally and in the states. Republican presidential nominees are asked consistently about whether theysupport a national ban at 15But none of those bans are likely to pass.Democrats should press them on more practical questions. Anti-abortion activists claim that the Comstock Act, a 19th century anti-vice law, is ade facto national ban on abortion. That's because the statute, they say, prohibits the mailing of any item intended, designed or adapted for abortion. No clinic makes their own pills or surgical tools - every abortion in the US relies on some item put in the mail, and that's why the Comstock Act, or at least abortion foes' interpretation of it, could pose such a threat.Democrats should ask GOP hopefuls and congressional candidates whether they would enforce the Comstock Act and how - and should make clear that Democrats might stand a better chance at repealing Comstock than they do at passing robust protections for abortion rights.Democrats can warn about how access to the abortion pill mifepristone might change if a Republican president reshaped the US Food and Drug Administration. Republican attorneys general are backing a suit seeking to removemifepristone from the market. They can also remind voters that a Republican might adopt the suggestion of some anti-abortion groups to sign an executive order recognizing limited forms offetal personhood.Progressives believe that Democrats could do more on abortion, and they aren't wrong. But political caution and possible losses in court make big, bold steps unlikely in the near term -and even potentially less likely to work.Still, the Ohio vote is a reminder that Democrats can do a lot with the abortion issue if they play their cards right: Even if Democrats can't get rid of Dobbs, the ruling that overturned abortion rights, in the near term, they can remind America's pro-choice majority just how much worse things can get.Opinion by Mary ZieglerTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
