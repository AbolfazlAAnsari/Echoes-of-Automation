It is not a civil approach to a convention.\"LIVE UPDATES: REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTIONFirst of all, what is she even talking about?The \"programming\" that Psaki seems to think is so unacceptably lacking in civility consists of four themes: ‘Make America Wealthy Again’, ‘Make America Safe Once Again’, ‘Make America Strong Once Again’, and on the final day, ‘Make America Great Once Again.’How on earth is any of that \"escalating\" the situation she was commenting on -- the attempted assassination of President Trump? It is a preposterous thing for Psaki to have said.How does she know what \"the rhetoric\" will be? Is Psaki secretly writing the remarks of the Republican speakers?Let’s assume no bad faith on her part. But let’s also be clear what her ludicrous statements unintentionally reveal: thebelief among partisan Democratsthat any challenge to their political power is by definition beyond the bounds of reasonable opinion.WHAT DID HARD LEFT EXPECT, AFTER YEARS OF HATEFUL ANTI-TRUMP RHETORIC?In fact, contrary to what Jen Psaki demands, the correct--and moral-- response to theshocking scenes on Saturdaywould be for the GOP Convention to go aheadexactly as planned.And an eerie echo from history tells us why.On October 12th, 1984, a terror organization, the Irish Republican Army, tried to assassinateBritish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.It happened during the Conservative Party convention (called the Party Conference) being held that year in Brighton, England. The terrorists planted a bomb in the Grand Hotel where Mrs. Thatcher, along with top Conservative Party officials, was staying.The bomb ripped through the hotel, killing five and injuring more than thirty.It obliterated the bathroom in Margaret Thatcher’s suite. She had been in that room just two minutes before the bomb went off. She had been working on her speech to the conference, took a bathroom break and then returned to her desk.FILE – (Original Caption) 10/15/84-Brighton, England- Interior of the Napoleon Suite bathroom at the Grand Hotel, Brighton, England 10/14 that Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had left only moments before an Irish Republican Army bomb blast in the early hours of last Friday 10/12.British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her husband Denis (1915 - 2003) leave the Grand Hotel in Brighton, after a bomb attack by the IRA, 12th October 1984.

(Photo by John Downing/Getty Images)FILE – (Original Caption) Brighton, England: Exterior of the Grand Hotel here, October 12th, after a powerful IRA bomb aimed for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet exploded killing at least 2 people and injuring 30 others.Two minutes different, and she would have been killed, at the height of her powers and before her triumphant re-election for a third term in 1987.It was a miraculous escape. But that’s not the only parallel between Brighton 1984 and Butler 2024.TALE OF TWO CONVENTIONS: GOP UNITED BEHIND TRUMP WHILE DEMS IN DISARRAYSoon after the attack, with many of her closest colleagues still buried in the rubble of the destroyed hotel, Margaret Thatcherappeared on camerato insist that the conference would go ahead exactly as planned.She even insisted that a local store be opened an hour early so that conference attendees could make sure they had fresh clothes.Later that morning, just a few hours after the assassination attempt that so nearly took her life, the prime ministeraddressed the conferencein the resolute style that was her hallmark:The attack \"was an attempt not only to disrupt and terminate our conference; it was an attempt to cripple Her Majesty’s democratically elected Government. That is the scale of the outrage in which we have all shared, and the fact that we are gathered here now, shocked but composed and determined, is a sign not only that this attack has failed, but that all attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail.\"STEVE SCALISE: THE LEFT'S 'HYPER-CHARGED,' VIOLENT RHETORIC 'NEEDS TO STOP'The ‘Brighton Bomb’, as it became known, happened 40 years ago. But I remember it as if it was last week.FILE - (Original Caption) 10/12/1984-Brighton, England-Picture shows Britain's Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, after her closing speech at the Conservative Party Conference in Brighton, following the Irish Republican Army's bomb blast earlier today at the Grand Hotel where Mrs. Thatcher was staying.FILE - British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1925 - 2013) and her husband Denis Thatcher (1915 - 2003) at the Conservative Party Conference in Brighton, the morning after the bombing of the Grand Hotel by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), UK, 12th October 1984. Thatcher and her cabinet were unhurt in the explosion, which killed five and injured more than 30. (Photo by Larry Ellis/Daily Express/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Perhaps that’s because Brighton is my hometown. It’s a seaside resort on the south coast of England, where party conventions were held regularly.That year, I remember hearing the news of the bomb when I woke up. I remember walking down to the seafront, before school, seeing the destruction for myself. It felt utterly apocalyptic. I was 15-years-old and the scene made a huge impression.But the other thing that made such a huge impression was Mrs. Thatcher’s courage and leadership. Years later, I had the great honor of meeting her on a number of occasions when I worked for the Conservative Party.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONAll this came to mind as I watched President Trump’s extraordinary reaction to the attempt to take his life on Saturday.Of course,Donald Trumpand Margaret Thatcher are completely different in many ways.FILE – (Original Caption) Tokyo, Japan: United States President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher meet for private talks prior to the beginning of the Tokyo economic conference.(Getty Images)But as I have said before, including on my Fox News Channel show, \"The Next Revolution,\" Trump resembles Thatcher -- as well as President Reagan (also, of course, the victim of a dramatic assassination attempt) -- in one crucial way.These are leaders who truly changed the course of their country -- and history. They are giants among political pygmies.As we saw President Trump rise up to rally his supporters moments after beinghit by an assassin’s bullet, in an image that will be one of the most iconic in American history, we can see why.Republican candidate Donald Trump is seen with blood on his face surrounded by secret service agents as he is taken off the stage at a campaign event at Butler Farm Show Inc. in Butler, Pennsylvania, July 13, 2024.
