After five years of steady increase, carjackings this year are also up almost 50%, which certainly endangered the life of Nasrat, who worked as a Lyft driver to support his wife and four children as they began their new life in the \"land of the free.\" In fact, a recent study found that certain areas of our nation’s big cities are more deadly that both the Iraq and Afghanistan war zones.And yet, despite the obvious deterioration of our nation’s capital and other big cities in America, the culture of lawlessness is allowed to continue around the nation. Prosecutors and politicians embrace soft-on-crime policies and refuse to acknowledge the damage they are doing. Even the iconic Union Station has been allowed to deteriorate into little more than a dangerous drug den.Rather than prioritizing safety and prosperity, politicians focus on power and pet agendas. They fight to restrict our Second Amendment rights to protect ourselves and loved ones from the very threat these politicians are creating by willfully ignoring the underlying causes of the lawless violence controlling our streets.Americans watch in horror as violent career criminals are held up as martyrs for equity while law-abiding citizens are vilified and labeled part of the problem. Substantive solutions to social problems are eclipsed by quick political \"wins\" that make for great campaign talking points as politicians seek re-election to continue to fail the American people, especially those in our inner cities.We are better than this. I dedicated my life to protecting and preserving that which makes America the greatest, freest and most prosperous nation in the world. Men like Aziz and Nasrat dedicated their lives to bring what they believed to be American freedom andgreatness to Afghanistan.As the leader of the free world, America has the responsibility to uphold the values and principles foundational to that greatness. I pray that the American people are willing to speak up and fight as hard as Aziz and Nasrat did to safeguard these values and principles of American greatness for generations to come.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CHAD ROBICHAUXChad Robichaux is a former Force Recon Marine and an Afghanistan veteran.
