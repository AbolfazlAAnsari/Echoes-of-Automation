Children arekilled walking outsideor recruited to participate in the fighting,kidnappings for ransomare on the rise and rates of sexual and gender-based violenceare surging.On my most recent visit to Haiti in June, I met another health care worker who had been kidnapped. Thankfully, she was later released. She told me that it was a daily fear for Haitian nurses, as well as teachers and other professionals who, like the American nurse, remain committed to staying and caring for the most vulnerable.Included among those most vulnerable is the 11-year-old girl I met atPort-au-Prince's GHESKIO Center, which provides care forsurvivors of sexual violence. Late last year, she told me, five men from an armed group abducted her while she was walking outside. Three of them took turns raping her. When I met her, she was about eight months pregnant. Several other women at the center spoke of armed men breaking in, raping them - in one case, in front of her children - and then setting their homes on fire.Violence is not new to Haiti.

Severely malnourished children are much more likely to die from cholera without urgent treatment. Yet the national health system does not have the capacity to provide adequate care to vulnerable children and families.To put the situation in perspective, humanitarian needs in Haiti are greater now than they were in the aftermath of the devastating January2010 earthquakethat left more than 220,000 people dead and over 2 million displaced.Despite the challenging security threats, our organization remains fully committed to staying and delivering for Haiti's people.
