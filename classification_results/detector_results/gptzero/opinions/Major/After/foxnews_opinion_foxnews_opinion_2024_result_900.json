The last time single-payer advocates came knocking in Sacramento, they were counting on Gov. Gavin Newsom going along with them to fulfill campaign promises. Staring down a record budget deficit, the governor is highly unlikely to back a wholesale single-payer system.In fact, it's unclear how he'll come up with the $2.6 billion a year he's committed for state-funded coverage for illegal immigrants through Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program.Even many California Democrats recognize thatsingle-payer is a pipe dream. \"I'm just stating the obvious, that's always been the concern about single-payer -- the cost,\" Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said last month.Fiscal reality may be thedeath knell for single-payerin California this year. But it's safe to assume that the state's progressives–not to mention the California Nurses Association, which has been a driving force behind AB 2200 and its predecessors – will resurrect the idea again and again.Patients should take note of how government-run systems in other countries delay and deny care – and make clear that they won't stand for such tragedies or farces here.
