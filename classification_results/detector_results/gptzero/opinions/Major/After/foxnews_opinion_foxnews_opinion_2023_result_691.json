More than two in five Gen Zers have been diagnosed with a mental health condition, and they are more likely to report mental health concerns than any other demographic group.It’s a conversation thatmany higher education institutionsare at the forefront of by providing services that can help young adults as they navigate through the many stressors in their lives. At our university, where I serve as president, students have access to licensed mental health care providers at our campus counseling center and through a 24/7 online service.A new report by Lumina and Gallup found that bachelor’s degree holders are more likely to say their health is excellent or very good compared to workers with no higher education. They are also more likely to exercise and seek preventative health care when needed.College can be the place where many students learn how to interact with peers from various backgrounds, build community and establish lifelong friendships. The same Lumina and Gallup report found that bachelor’s degree holders are more likely to engage in social behaviors with friends, family and neighbors, which can promote their overall well-being.College students stand in their caps and gowns at graduation.(Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)Finally, a college degree can increase your student’s civic engagement. Studies have shown that people with a four-year degree are more likely to participate in the political process (such as voting), volunteer in their communities and give to charities.Higher education institutions help foster the importance of performing one’s civic duties. Through courses, guest lectures, seminars and school clubs, students learn the importance of being a good citizen. When it comes to election season, voting is a pivotal step in creating change, and many college graduates understand the importance of letting their voices be heard. In the 2020 presidential election, there was higher voter participation from those who held at least a bachelor’s degree.College graduates also recognize the value of giving back to their communities through their time and finances. In fact, 67 percent of bachelor’s degree holders say they donated to charity in the last 12 months, compared with 38 percent of U.S. adults with no higher education, according to the Lumina and Gallup report. And the rate of those who volunteer nearly doubled from degree holders to those with no higher education.Many colleges, like ours, provide students with opportunities to volunteer locally and globally so they can learn about the great needs of our world. Volunteering not only benefits where your student serves but also positively contributes to their physical health.While it may be easy for your student to want to dive into a job right after graduating from high school, they need to think about their long-term investment. What may seem compelling now (such as a full-time job), may not be the best choice for their future when it comes to financial security and truly discovering what they want to do in life. After all, a college degree not only benefits the person who obtains it, but it can make a significant difference in the lives of those around them.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE DR.
