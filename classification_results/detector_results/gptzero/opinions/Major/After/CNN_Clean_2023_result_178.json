If abortion opponents are successful, access to the pill - reportedly used inmore than halfof abortions in the United States - will be severely undercut.Beyond the dangerous precedent this sets for challenges to other important FDA-approved drugs that some political factions don't like, the case is an alarming expression of the way right-wing activists are using junk science tobypass the will of the American publicand restrict abortion.US District Judge Matthew Kacsmarykof Texas blocked the use of mifepristone Friday after the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, a group of anti-abortion doctors, employed dubious arguments to challenge the medication's approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000.The groupallegesthat the FDA failed to engage in a rigorous review of the drug, lacked the authority to approve the drug and rushed it to market without thorough consideration of the health implications (the Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents the plaintiffs, claims that the drug imperils the health and even lives ofpregnant women.)The FDA, inappealing the Texas ruling, supported its process for authorizing Mifiprex, the brand name for mifepristone. The \"FDA approved Mifeprex more than 20 years ago based on a comprehensive review of the scientific evidence available and determined that it was safe and effective,\" the agency said. \"The approval was based on the best available science and done in accordance with the laws that govern our work.\"The Texas suit additionally claims that mifepristone was criminalized under the 1873 Comstock Act, afederal law that prohibits mailingany \"article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion.\" That legal interpretation would limit access to mifepristone because drug suppliers need to ship it to providers.For now, the drug remains available. Kacsmaryk gave the governmenta weekto file an appeal, which is among thelegal measuresunderway to keep the ruling from going into effect. At the same time, in a case brought by 17 states and the District of Columbia, U.S. District Judge Thomas Owen Rice in Washington state ordered the FDA to keep mifepristone available in thosejurisdictions.The states had argued that the FDA should lift some of the restrictions on mifepristone access, which they argued were unnecessary and unsupported by science. Rice insteadordered the FDAto preserve access in the states that had brought suit.Kacsmaryk's ruling is unprecedented. It is rare for parties to challenge the FDA's approval of drugs, but for a judge to second-guess a decision on a drug that has safely been on the market for more than 20 years is just aboutunheard of- especially when there is no legitimate case that the plaintiffs have thestanding to sue.Any fair investigation of the FDA's process would show that there are no grounds for challenging mifepristone's approval, especially 23 years after the fact. The drug received extensive review -more than four years- before FDA approval. Moreover, claims that mifepristone threatens the health of those who take it are unfounded. The drug has a better safety record for use thanViagra and penicillin. Notably, it was available and used for years without incident inEurope.Altogether, for those whotake mifepristone\"serious side effects occur in less than 1% of patients, and major adverse events-significant infection, blood loss, or hospitalization-occur in less than 0.3% of patients. The risk of death is almost non-existent.\"The case was never about the safety of mifepristone, however. Anti-abortion groups like the ADF cling to dubious scientific claims to bypass majority politics, putting decisions in the hands of conservative judges andconfusing voterswho don't always feel qualified to have an opinion on how a drug like mifepristone works.Since 2022, voters have sent a clear message when the question is what abortion law ought to look like: They have sided withsupporters of abortion rightsin six out of sixballot initiatives, boosted Democraticcandidatesand, just last week, transformed theWisconsin Supreme Court. A recent Ipsos poll found that nearly two-thirds of Americans want medication abortion to bekept legal.Kacsmaryk's ruling is part of a strategy to take the question away from voters and to reframe abortion as something that ordinary Americans neither understand nor get a say about. Such an approach isn't new, and it's not going anywhere anytime soon; if the anti-abortion movement can't win in a fair democratic fight, its members will seek out ways to change the rules.Many antiabortion groups have long tried to undermine abortion by claiming that it harms girls and women - and that abortion opponents were seeking to protect pregnant people from the \"abortion industry.\"This strategy underwrote targeted regulations of abortion providers (TRAP laws), onerous clinicregulationsand statutes forcing women to receive medically unnecessary and invasive vaginalultrasounds. State legislatures enacted burdensomelaws requiring waiting periodsbefore a woman can legally terminate apregnancy. This all despite the fact that a woman is about14 times more likelyto die by carrying a pregnancy to term than having an abortion.When the Supreme Court upheld the federalPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Actin 2007, dubious scientific arguments became even more central to anti-abortion advocacy. InGonzales v. Carhart, the court held that in circumstances of scientific uncertainty, legislators would have more latitude to regulate abortion. That incentivized antiabortion groups to identify or manufacture uncertainty by creating their own data and fielding their ownwitnesses.Implausible scientific claims are now visible onsocial media, inlawsuitsand in congressional hearings. In a separate fight, for example, the antiabortion group Students for Life of America has asked the FDA to reconsider its mifepristone approval by making claims about the ill effects of abortion onwastewater.In Congress, abortion opponents testified - contrary to the position taken by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists - that life-saving abortions, or even abortions in cases of rape, were not \"abortions\" at all. (By taking this position, abortion opponents can still defend bans with no or few exceptions by claiming that abortion is never necessary.)That Kacsmaryk embraced snake-oil science underscores concerns that broader dangers loom. If his ruling stands, this case sends a message that challengers don't need to have science on their side, or even the standing, to sue. All that matters is control of the courts.Opinion by Michele Goodwin and Mary ZieglerTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
