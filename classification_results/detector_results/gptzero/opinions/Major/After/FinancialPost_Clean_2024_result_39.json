Demand for oil and gas around the globe has only gone up. Increasingly it is being satisfied by nations far less environmentally responsible than Canada. Our loss - in jobs and economic vibrancy - has not been the environment's gain.The fact that our supposedly apolitical banks have committed themselves to net zero is particularly worrisome. For the past several years, environmental activists have been extremely active at the annual general meetings (AGMs) of our Big Five banks, using shareholder proposals to introduce issues to management and push boards of directors to shift corporate policies.The activists' demands have included(https://financialpost.com/fp-finance/banking/banks-shareholder-pressure-climate-resolutions-agms-loom) that the boards \"set a deadline for when banks will stop funding new fossil fuel developments,\" \"provide more details on how they will achieve 2030 financed emissions targets,\" and \"submit concrete plans to reduce absolute emissions in the real world to reach net zero goals,\" among other proposals. These \"asks\" have all been focused on the suppression and eventual elimination of Canada's oil and gas sector, one of our country's most productive and vital and a long-standing pillar of our economy.For years these proposals went unchallenged - until last year when InvestNow, the organization I lead, submitted different proposals to the banks. We asked them for explicit commitments to continue to finance and invest in oil and gas and to suspend or postpone their net zero pledges. All were voted on. Though they did not pass, we are in this for the long haul and will continue to stand up for Canadians.This year we are back with new shareholder proposals for the Big Five banks. We are asking them to commission reports qualifying and quantifying the impacts of divestment from the Canadian oil and gas sector on shareholder value and other relevant economic variables should they continue on the path toward currently established net zero objectives.It is shocking that so few banks have attempted serious analyses along these lines. The ones that have been done are sobering. A 2021 TD Economics report(https://economics.td.com/esg-energy-sector) concluded that, \"With the federal government's recent commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, Canada's oil and gas industry will face a seismic shift. Fossil fuel usage will need to fall precipitously from current levels and in turn, hundreds of thousands of oil and gas workers could be displaced.\" In the same year, a report(https://thoughtleadership.rbc.com/the-2-trillion-transition/ ) from RBC put the cost of net zero at $2 trillion.Protecting corporate Canada from takeovers hurts productivity(https://financialpost.com/opinion/protecting-corporate-canada-takeovers-hurts-productivity)Legault government keeps breaking spending records(https://financialpost.com/opinion/legault-government-keeps-breaking-spending-records)Commit to support those with rare diseases(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-on-this-rarest-of-days-commit-to-support-those-with-rare-diseases)But two reports from two banks with no updates is not nearly enough. We believe the banks are charging blindly towards net zero and need to be held accountable. Pledging net zero by 2050 without a clear and complete understanding of the costs is irresponsible. For individual banks and corporations, it puts at risk the returns of their shareholders. For Canada and Canadians, it risks our prosperity and way of life.Gina Pappano is executive director of InvestNow and former head of market intelligence at the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV).Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the business news you need to know - add financialpost.com(https://financialpost.com/ ) to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here(https://financialpost.com/newsletters/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2024 Postmedia Network Inc.
