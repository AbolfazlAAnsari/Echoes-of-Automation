            "inputText": "Assisted death in Canada has expanded rapidly and widely since the first version of this practice became legal in 2016. In 2021 alone, more than 10,000 Canadians died via assisted death.While assisted death is often championed as an expression of autonomy, it is questionable how much autonomy many Canadians truly enjoy in this context. Hundreds(https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/medical-assistance-dying/annual-report-2021.html) of Canadians who resorted to assisted death in 2021 needed disability supports or palliative care but lacked access. The provision or adequacy of such supports was unknown for many others.In 2021, more than one in three Canadians who died by assisted death cited their perception of being a burden on others as a motivating factor. Many others also reported \"isolation or loneliness.\" In recent months, the media has reported troubling stories(https://www.cbc.ca/news/fifthestate/a-complicated-death-1.6717266) of Canadians with disabilities who wish to live but whose adverse socioeconomic conditions have driven them to view assisted death as their only \"solution.\"Many have expressed concern(https://apnews.com/article/covid-science-health-toronto-7c631558a457188d2bd2b5cfd360a867) with what assisted death has become in Canada. It seems to be evolving into something other than a \"stringently limited, carefully monitored system of exceptions,\" as contemplated by the Supreme Court in 2015 in Carter. That was the court case which led Parliament to introduce the \"first version\" of assisted death in 2016 for adults whose medical condition is incurable and suffering is intolerable, but only if their natural death is \"reasonably foreseeable.\"Assisted death soon also became available to persons suffering intolerably and incurably at any stage of adult life, regardless of whether natural death is on the horizon. This expansion occurred in 2021 when the federal government codified into legislation the essence of a 2019 ruling of a Quebec court in a case called Truchon. That expansion eventually included provision for assisted death for adults suffering solely from mental illness, which was set to take effect this March.Many have insisted that Canada should not take this step around mental illness, and the federal government recently announced that it would delay by a year(https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/maid-expansion-to-the-mentally-ill-to-be-delayed-one-year) - but not abandon - this step. The Justice Minister David Lametti has suggested(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/maid-expansion-on-hold-nwt-1.6704124) that it is unconstitutional to exclude mental illness as a sole basis for receiving assisted death.But neither Carter nor Truchon ruling involved plaintiffs with mental illness. While some lower courts have opined that Carter did not exclude mental illness per se, the Supreme Court never stated that the Constitution requires assisted death in cases where mental illness is the sole underlying condition. Constitutional clarity should be sought on this question before accepting the inherent risks of expansion to this context and beyond. For example, during recent discussions at parliamentary committees, mature minors and infants with severe illnesses(https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/assisted-dying-carla-qualtrough-1.6625412) have been recommended as future candidates for assisted death.There is a pressing need to seek further guidance from the Supreme Court on what form of assisted death is required by the Constitution. The federal cabinet should refer a set of legal questions(https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/201544E) to the Court and ask it to issue an advisory opinion on these questions.For instance: does the Charter of Rights and Freedoms require the government to provide assisted death to persons suffering solely from mental illness? Does Parliament have no constitutional leeway to restrict assisted death in this context, based on careful assessment of complex medical, social, and human rights concerns?The Court's ruling on assisted death in 2015 did not answer these questions. Indeed, the Court noted in Carter that \"euthanasia for minors or persons with psychiatric disorders or minor medical conditions\" does \"not fall within the parameters suggested in these reasons.\"Yuan Yi Zhu: The assisted suicide doctors who freely admit their patients are driven by poverty(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/the-assisted-suicide-doctors-who-admit-patients-are-driven-by-poverty)Michael Higgins: Veterans Affairs doubles down on its intolerable behaviour offering assisted death(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/veterans-affairs-doubles-down-on-intolerable-behaviour-offering-assisted-death)As for whether the Constitution guarantees assisted death when death is not reasonably foreseeable, Carter is, in our view, less than crystal clear. This may explain why Parliament, in responding to Carter, legislated the first version of assisted death in a form that restricted it to patients whose death is approaching. Constitutional clarity is needed on this front too.The Court should also be asked whether governments might breach the charter by rendering the criteria for assisted death so broad and access to the procedure so straightforward while offering insufficient support for persons who are suffering and wish to live or have a natural death. One can imagine, as a group of UN human rights experts has,(https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadPublicCommunicationFile?gId=26002__;!!MtWvt2UVEQ!BY5OFcciBZ9CEGKQ8boB14Op9T__UEir6yLs4ZFdESqzAp_Zpa5F85XOQFyclvbjA6i6XxSCp1--6hMWjg$) how this situation might endanger the lives of Canadians and thereby violate their fundamental rights.Whether or not one agrees with these concerns, all sides of the debate on assisted death can agree that the introduction and expansion of this practice in our society is a tectonic change for Canada. The debate over whether this change is for the better or for the worse will continue, and we do not expect the Supreme Court to resolve that debate.But it is imperative to have clarity on what the Constitution has to say about these specific questions. To the extent that the Constitution does not require certain forms of assisted death, lawmakers must bear the responsibility of justifying why those forms should be pursued, and they must do so on grounds other than fidelity to the charter.Brian Bird is an assistant professor at the Peter A.
