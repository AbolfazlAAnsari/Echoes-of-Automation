Through TikTok, the CCP is waging psychological warfare on the United States, sowing conflict in order to destabilize and dumb down American society.HERE'S THE DATA THAT TIKTOK COLLECTS ON ITS USERSI lived through Mao’s horrific program of destruction in China, called the Great Cultural Revolution. I watched as Mao’s regime eviscerated the 3,000-year-old Chinese civilization and indoctrinated young people into Maoist robots who had loyalty to no one but Mao and who were willing to doanythingin defense of Mao. That includes turning in their own parents!Most Americans today are completely oblivious to this history and the mercilessness of the CCP because the U.S. education and media establishments have erased it from the cultural consciousness. But it is a future we all face if urgent action is not taken to address this threat.Lawmakers like Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin are correct when they refer to TikTok as \"digital fentanyl.\" Just as the CCP uses that deadly drug to poison the bodies of the American people, it uses TikTok to poison the minds of American youth.As Congress considers legislative action to counter TikTok’s malign influence, parents and schools also have a responsibility to remain vigilant.Many universitiesand even some K-12 schools have blocked TikTok on their Wi-Fi networks. This is an easy and commonsense first step that other institutions should follow.The ongoing effort to remove far-left ideologies from school curriculum is also a critical way to fight back. In addition, we need to do a better job of teaching American students the horrors ofsocialism and communismand the threat they pose to America. If we equip kids with the intellectual tools and historical context they need to understand the CCP’s attempts to use TikTok to manipulate them, they stand a far better chance of avoiding falling victim to the indoctrination.But ultimately, facing down the threat posed by TikTok will once againfall primarily on parents. In addition to ensuring that their own children stay far away from TikTok – and ideally most other social media apps – parents must also demand that their elected leaders and school officials take actions to protect our kids."
