Or people may attend, but then complain that they had seen all the jokes before.In the case of Chappelle, there's the added concern of his deal with Netflix that pays the comic reportedly$20 millionper stand-up special. In fact, Chappelle's new Netflix special, \"The Dreamer\" with a December 31 release date, is his7th specialfor the streaming giant in 6 years. Obviously, if audience members were to record his tour and post videos of the material online ahead of the Netflix release, it could negatively impact how many people watch the show.But something else is at play here as well. Some famous comedians don't want to be recorded in case they say something offensive on stage that could hurt their career or even lead them to being \"canceled.\"In fact, Rock made that very point around the time he walked off stage in 2014, tellingVulturethat knowing people are recording your every word - especially when workshopping new material - can cause comedians to self-censor. As Rock explained, in the past a comedian could \"cross the line\" trying to find funny material, but with cameras everywhere it leads comedians like Rock to believe \"you don't have room to make mistakes.\"In the case of Chappelle however, I doubt that was his rationale for beingone of the first comediansto require audience members to lock their cell phones away during his shows. Chappelle's history tells us he seems to love to court controversy, from his past Saturday Night Live monologues aboutKanye West's anti-Semitic remarksand onDonald Trump's then-new presidency to jokes about the transgender community in his2021 stand-up specialthat prompted a backlash.Even if audience members aren't recording his act, Chappelle knows his jokes and comments will get press, given his stature and his penchant for telling provocative jokes that sometimes upset people. And that includes hismost recent standup show on Netflix.But courting controversy hasn't seemed to hurt Chapelle's career. In fact, it may just have proved to be rocket fuel for it, as evidenced by the fact that in 2023, he was thetop-grossing comedianof the year, earning $62 million for 31 ticketed shows in 2023. (And that doesn't even include what he brought in co-headlining shows in 2023 with Chris Rock.)People can like or hate his jokes, but a backlash won't stop Chappelle, whosaidlast year about these controversies: \"The more you say I can't say something, the more urgent it is for me to say it.\"Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
