While the number of people imprisoned for anti-war dissidence issmall(relative to the population), the obscene nature of the punishments (such as the25-year sentence handed down to Vladimir Kara Murza for anti-war criticism) in relation to the supposed \"crimes\" has a chilling effect on anyone else who might be inclined to voice a political opinion inconvenient to the Kremlin.While Ukraine's drone attacks won't do much to counter the fear of imprisonment, they do make it much harder for Russians not to think about the war, especially if that war has damaged their own house or health, or could pose such a risk.An overwhelming majorityof Russians are aware of the attacks and see them as a threat to Russia. After all,numerousreportsfromthe border regions have shown that locals are highly critical of the government's handling of the war, and the announcement of mobilisation in September 2022led to a notable, albeit temporary, dropin nationwide approval of the war.The more personally affected by the war you are, the higher the chance is that you will resent the Russian state's failure to uphold its end of the bargain: The people stay out of politics and the politicians stay out of their lives.And yet,countrywide polls suggestthat Russian support for the war has slightly risen in the wake of Ukrainian attacks. Moreover, the main response is one of continued passivity: Respondents express sorrow more than anger. This could well be a question of capacity - there have not been sufficient drones and attacks to make a personal impact on a statistically significant number of people - but it also conceals a further, even more intractable, issue.Even if Russians did start to turn against the war, it would not necessarily signal a change in how they view Russia's role in the world, or right to decide Ukraine's position in that same world. It would, at most, signify that they do not want to pay certain personal costs for it. More importantly, it would not automatically equate to disapproval of President Vladimir Putin.There are two main reasons for this disconnect. First, because Putin has conflated himself with the state, such that his removal from power would be widely seen as the collapse of the Russian state, absent a utopic popular and legitimate transfer of power. Given that one of the most dominant fears in Russian socio-political imagination is the fear of stateweakness and collapse,this will temper any radical shift against Putin. The president deftly plays on this dread through propaganda that exaggerates the (admittedly genuine and woeful) chaos and misery of the \"wild 1990s,\" with its shock therapy transition to capitalism, lawlessness and poverty.Second, Putin is rarely, if ever, held to account for his failings; for example, many Russians blame the Minister of Defence, Sergei Shoigu, or the Head of the Armed Forces, Valery Gerasimov, for military incompetence, corruption and mistakes.When it comes to avoiding responsibility, Putin is a talented escape artist. In July, the Russian president gavegovernors the legal right to createtheir own local private military companies,meaning thatfailure to prevent attacks on Russian territory becomes a local, gubernatorial issue, rather than a matter of national security.Against the backdrop of all these factors, it seems unlikely that Ukraine, or anyone, could develop the capacity to turn Russians against the war by drone and border incursions alone. What it could do, is politicise growing numbers of Russians by stealth, as they realise that their own personal interests and security are at stake. Any such moment is unlikely to come during Putin's lifetime, if at all.Until then, the biggest impact of Ukraine's strikes will be to raise the morale of its own people. Given the increasingly evident limits of Western support for Ukraine's victory, such as the reluctance to provide, in a timely fashion, the weapons needed to preserve Ukraine's soldiers and civilians alike, this is the more strategically meaningful purpose.Unlike in Russia, Ukraine's population is not passive or depoliticised, as shown by its heroic fight for its sovereignty. But even Ukrainians aren't superhumans, and it is beyond exorbitant to demand they fight a devastating war of attrition against a larger, better-resourced enemy without seeing that enemy face consequences for its crimes.The drone attacks probably won't turn Russians against the war. But they might give succour to Ukraine's most sacred and strategic resource, one that is running out in inverse proportion to Westernarms rationing: the Ukrainian people.Opinion by Jade McGlynnTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
