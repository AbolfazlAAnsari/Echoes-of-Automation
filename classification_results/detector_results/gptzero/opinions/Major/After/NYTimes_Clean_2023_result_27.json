Yet concern for these children’s well-being is precisely why we should — indeed why we must — embrace the A.A.P. guidelines.Childhood obesity worldwide is10 times higherthan in the 1970s. Although the author is correct that there are complexities in the interpretation of body mass index (B.M.I.) when used as a screening tool, there is conclusive evidence, in study after study, of a direct correlation between B.M.I. and medical complications, both in children and adults.These medical complications are what create the sense of urgency regarding the pandemic of childhood obesity that we, as a society, face. Perhaps most notable among these is childhood Type II diabetes, once a rarity. This condition is far more aggressive in the progression to complications and lethality than Type II diabetes in adults. Additional complications of childhood obesity include ovarian dysfunction, liver and cardiovascular damage, disabling orthopedic conditions and sleep apnea, among others.While it is concerning that we are now prescribing medications to younger children and referring them for bariatric/metabolic surgery, it is far more concerning to contemplate the outcomes for these children without the availability of these potential therapeutic options.In each instance that we are able to alter the trajectory of unhealthy weight gain in a child, we are markedly improving that child’s likelihood of a normal life span and quality of life.Barry J. ReinerBaltimoreThe writer is a pediatric endocrinologist.To the Editor:Virginia Sole-Smith is right in criticizing the idea that losing weight in childhood will lead to health and happiness. The idea of bariatric surgery on a child is utterly barbaric. But I don’t agree that an approach called“Health at Every Size”is a possible solution — because the problem is often rooted in mental, not physical, health.When I was 11 and a little chubby but definitely not obese, my mother took me to a diet doctor who gave me pills and put me on a diet. I did lose weight, but quickly gained it back and more, bringing on a devastating sense of failure, which led to decades of weight obsession and an eating disorder.But I have now had 34 years of peace with food and a stable, healthy weight and mind because I learned from a 12-step program for compulsive eaters that excess food can be a symptom of unhappiness and self-loathing. For children, food is the only numbing drug available.What children need is a bigger picture that reveals the subtle cruelty of impossible physical expectations. They need a path to self-love, a simple practice of three meals a day and a peer group to discuss how hard — yet possible — it is to find peace with food. The peer group is essential; no one heals from a largely socially caused disease alone.Nancy Ellen AbramsSanta Cruz, Calif.To the Editor:I couldn’t agree more with the premise of this essay: Stop judging kids by their size.I am a 55-year-old man. Thin. I always have been. Why? Because of this country’s bizarre obsession with “fat.”As a child I was constantly reminded that “fat” people are lazy, sick and destined to die at a young age. Even worse for an adolescent: “Fat” people are unattractive, unfit and destined to live lonely lives on the edge of society.Bunk. The result for me? I developed a severe eating disorder. I needed to prove to myself (and to society?) that I wasn’t lazy or unfit. I definitely did not want to be forever alone, or die of a heart attack in my 40s. So I began to run (excessively), restricted my eating (I was already on the thin side) and soon thereafter I was caught in the grip of anorexia nervosa.Forty years on it still has me in its grip. I’ve lost relationships, suffered with hormonal imbalance, developed severe osteoporosis. Why? To avoid the shame of being “fat.”Society’s unfounded fear of large bodies destroys lives. Fat shaming children will only perpetuate this ill-founded perception and cause more kids a lifetime of pain and isolation.Fat isn’t the culprit here. Societal obsession about maintaining a made-up aesthetic is the villain.Steve ChamberlinRockport, Mass.To the Editor:One out of fiveAmerican children is obese. A worrisome fact.Though various niceties of language are recommended by the guidelines in professional dealings with these children, a fundamental cause of the problem might be our cultural patterns related to the way we eat in 21st-century America.Few families give priority to the importance of sitting together for meals at regular times. Much caloric intake comes from random “snacking” all day long on prepared, salted or sweet foods and soft drinks. Add that to high-calorie fast-food daytime meals, and it is no wonder that studies show that many children take in more daily calories than they expend in physical activity — the basic cause of weight gain!It is perhaps the American way of eating and living that is one of the reasons for this physical and social problem of child obesity and its medical consequences in later life.Robert S. AprilNew YorkThe writer is a neurologist.To the Editor:As a registered dietitian and board-certified eating disorder specialist, I, like so many of my colleagues, reject the American Academy of Pediatrics’ recentlypublished guidelinesfor evaluating and treating children and adolescents with obesity.Additionally, as a person of color, I take much offense to these guidelines as they will without a doubt disproportionally affect and further stigmatize Black and brown folks.While there is brief acknowledgment of the effects of factors like structural racism, microaggressions, poverty and environment on health, the guidelines jump directly to linking these factors with obesity. As if losing weight will help a child get out of poverty, or provide access to food, health care and an environment where they feel safe to just exist?Rather than using this as an opportunity to state the need for meaningful policy change, the best they can do is encourage practitioners to prescribe weight loss medication to kids? I encourage all health care professionals to take a moment to reflect on the principle of “do no harm.”Cristina RiveraEast Northport, N.Y.This article appeared in print on page SR11."
