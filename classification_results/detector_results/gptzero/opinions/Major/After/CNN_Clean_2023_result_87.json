It is an objective he reiterated on Thursday while talking about the Chinese balloon that traversed the US earlier this month.If Putin's conflict with Ukraine had turned into a swift Russian victory, the alliance of autocracies would have made huge strides. Moscow's stumbling has slowed its progress. As Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman noted, Russiacould become an albatrossaround Beijing's neck.Without Chinese military backing, Putin has looked to other regimes for assistance.According to US intelligence, Russia has bought artillery shellsfrom North Korea, another notorious dictatorship, which denies its involvement in a war whose morality is beyond the pale.But it is Iran that has apparently provided more significant support.Iranian drones have been one of the weapons of choice as Russia kills Ukrainian civilians and destroys Ukraine's infrastructure. Tehran first denied it was arming Russia,saying it\"has not and will not\" provide weapons to Russia.Those adamant denials changed later, with Iran claiming it sold weaponsbefore the warstarted, but those were not being used in Ukraine. Now,newly-declassified documentsshow the drones in Ukraine are identical to those Iran has used in the Middle East.Iran, whoserepressive,interventionist regimehas also turned it,like Russia, into a pariah to much of the world, now finds itself being courted by both Moscow and Beijing.This week, Ebrahim Raisi became thefirst Iranian presidentto visit China in 20 years. The trip, at Xi's invitation, ostensibly aims to implement an agreement for a 25-year strategic cooperation pact the two reached at a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in 2021.The Beijing-Tehran tieshave raised alarmsamong both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, who fear China's support could help Tehran evade sanctions related to itsnuclearandconventional weaponsprograms,support for terrorismandhuman rights abuses.Sitting with Raisi, Xideclared that Chinawill strengthen cooperation with Iran, \"no matter how international and regional situations change.\" Still, recall the \"no limits\" pledge to Russia. Xi's vows can prove more conditional than they sound.Beijing's relationship with Tehran is complicated. In December, when Xi visited Iran-foe Saudi Arabia, ajoint statementafter meeting with Saudi officials noted Iran's \"destabilizing regional activities\" and \"support for terrorist and sectarian groups,\"infuriating Iran.Clearly, there's an internal contradiction in Xi's dual goals. If you want to elevate your standing to that of a respected global leader, it's hard to create an alliance of rule-breaking autocrats and assorted dictators, and then expect other countries to join enthusiastically.Much has changed since that day in Beijing, when Xi and Putin smiled for the cameras, expecting a new era to begin. The war didn't turn out as expected, but it did make it clear that democracies need to push back against belligerent antidemocratic regimes and keep them from joining forces.Opinion by Frida GhitisTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
