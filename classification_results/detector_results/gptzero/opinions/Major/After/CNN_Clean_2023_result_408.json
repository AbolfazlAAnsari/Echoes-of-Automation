They have developed an ingrained cynicism and habitually look for alternative voices.During the 1979-89 Soviet war in Afghanistan, for example, it was the grapevine. One mother of a Russian soldier recounted to me how she had been told by authorities at the time that her son had died in a training accident. Eventually, the grandmother of one of his squad mates got word to her that he had actually been killed when his truck hit a mine on the treacherous Salang Highway.Now, though, Russians who want news about the war - and many, in fairness,would rather remain ignorantas much because it is depressing as because they would rather not be faced with tough moral choices - turn to the internet. Even before the war, almosthalf got their news from social media, with the proportion having risen since the invasion. Meanwhile the viewership ofTV news has declined.The informal, online contingent of the so-called \"voenkory\"or \"military correspondents\" - although many are more commentators than reporters - have emerged as significant and distinctive in shaping understandings of the war.Former journalist Semyon Pegov, behind theWarGonzoTelegram channel, for example, has over 1.3 million subscribers.
