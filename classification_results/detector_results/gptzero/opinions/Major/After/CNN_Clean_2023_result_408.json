They have developed an ingrained cynicism and habitually look for alternative voices.During the 1979-89 Soviet war in Afghanistan, for example, it was the grapevine. One mother of a Russian soldier recounted to me how she had been told by authorities at the time that her son had died in a training accident.

Even before the war, almosthalf got their news from social media, with the proportion having risen since the invasion.
