Mike Garcia. Garcia cited him directly, stating that when service members deploy, they lose some of their food subsidies. Garcia went on to say that this is both a financial concern for our service members and a retention concern for the force at-large — and therefore a national security concern.The Denver city government's handling of the illegal immigrant crisis has caused much consternation for local residents.(Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)Before states can pass new legislation to support illegal migrants, Congress should update outdated legislation in support of our troops.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONCongress should adjust the current tax exclusion into a \"Deployment Income\" tax exclusion (DITE) for any service members on an overseas tour of duty.On Wilson’s deployment, the average sergeant with a spouse and children received an additional $45 a month once all deductions and entitlements were aggregated. Forty-five dollars a month is nowhere near enough to cover even one day’s average childcare costs.Meanwhile, in New York, illegal migrants are about to be given prepaid debit cards — each person receiving about $360 monthly — which for a family of four would be roughly $1,440 per month. Thus, while an average military family is suffering from a deficit of $1,860 over a period of nine months, a similarly sized illegal migrant family is being given nearly seven times more by virtue of illegally occupying the country.If the tax exclusion were reformed, the average sergeant would retain $724 more each month — enough to cover 21 hours of childcare monthly in his or her absence.DITE would exempt the less than 0.1% of Americans currently serving on overseas deployments or rotations. Considering the U.S. averages over $100 billion dollars in increased tax revenue year-over-year and because this is a tax exclusion and not a revenue allotment, it would not even require an enumerated allocation in the next National Defense Authorization Act.Unlike the illegal migrants that disregard our laws, our soldiers put their lives on the line protecting them. Our military is shrinking, and it is no wonder. Unless we take care of them, we will find ourselves with no one to take care of us.Bess Blackburn is editor-in-chief of Political Philosophy at \"The Liberty Journal of Statesmanship & Public Policy\" and a researcher and writer.
