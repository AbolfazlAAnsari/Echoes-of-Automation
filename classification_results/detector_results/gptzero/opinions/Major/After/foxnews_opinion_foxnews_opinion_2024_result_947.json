Indeed, all the crimes above were only possible because open-border policies allowed the perpetrators to enter or remain in the U.S. illegally.Rather than change their tune, however, the Biden administration continues to evade responsibility and pass the risk to everyday Americans. The result: not only a mounting toll of victims, but little towns across America that are struggling to balance their budgets and provide public resources to their own people because they are being overwhelmed by illegal immigrants.It doesn’t have to be this way. The Biden administration has the power to immediately alleviate the crisis – which he both caused and exacerbated – and put a stop to preventable migrant crime.Migrants arrive at a makeshift camp after crossing the nearby border with Mexico near the Jacumba Hot Springs on February 23, 2024, in San Diego, California.(Qian Weizhong/VCG via Getty Images)First, Biden should immediately end his lawless abuse of immigration parole. He has misused this limited power, conceived as an exception to allow in only a few people a year, to bring 36,000 people a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, and tens of thousands more from Afghanistan, Ukraine, and other countries around the world.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONNone of these people – more often than not single, young men – are subject to a criminal background check in their home country. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas simply takes them at their word, which clearly is a high-risk gamble.Second, all law enforcement in the United States, from federal to state, local, and tribal, should be required to report the immigration status of people they arrest. That way, the American people can actually know the risks Biden is asking us to run. Hiding the truth is nothing short of insulting.The murder of nursing student Laken Riley in Athens, Georgia, by an illegal immigrant from Venezuela with outstanding charges was one of the first stories to raise the alarm in late February. But it’s far from the only one.Third, Mayorkas should rescind his enforcement priorities memo and allow ICE to get on with their job of arresting and deporting alien criminals without burdensome administrative obstacles.Finally, Biden should enforce laws already on the books by detaining illegal border crossers or having them remain south of the border until their immigration cases are concluded.By doing these simple things, with powers he already has, Biden could protect American citizens in small towns and big cities alike. But don’t hold your breath, the Biden administration has been facilitating mass illegal immigration through virtually open borders from day one. They won’t change now.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SIMON HANKINSONSimon Hankinson is a senior research fellow in the Border Security and Immigration Center at The Heritage Foundation.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
