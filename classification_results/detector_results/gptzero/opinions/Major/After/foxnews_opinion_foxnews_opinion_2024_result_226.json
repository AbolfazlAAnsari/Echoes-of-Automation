Will the White House climate zealots actually decide against it?At the same time, war in the Middle East is driving home once again that energy security is national security; the government’s war on fossil fuels looks dumber by the minute. Aggression fromRussia’s Putinand Iran’s mullahs is funded by oil; they would have less money to invest in malicious activities were it not for the Biden White House discouraging U.S. production which could bring global prices down. US output is currently 13.2 million barrels per day, finally surpassing the 13 mb/d peak reached during the Trump presidency. But….it would be higher but for the delays in leasing, increased fees, and other obstacles thrown up by the Biden group.Kerry and Joe Biden have a lot to answer for.After all, if the climate agenda were such a resounding success, why isn’t the president tooting his horn about solar fields and electric stoves instead of yelling that Trump is an existential threat to our democracy? John Kerry is reportedly going to join the campaign team to remind voters how successful Biden’s climate program has been. Will that boost Biden’s chances?It’s hard to imagine Kerry touring the country and cheering on the White House’s push forelectric vehicles, for instance. After all, in just the past several days, Hertz decided to sell the bulk of its EV rental fleet – 20,000 cars -- because they are sitting idle on their lots and cost too much money to maintain. Americans don’t want to rent EVs, and they don’t want to buy them either, in spite of the White House ladling out ever more money to make the pricey cars more affordable.Passing the huge Inflation Reduction Act, which even the liberal Economist admits is a \"misleadingly\" labeled climate bill, is considered a major achievement by theBiden team. The $370 billion bill was passed by Democrats, failing to garner a single GOP vote.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThere’s a reason for that. Bloomberg, an organization all-in on fighting climate change, wrote last summer that the \"price tag\" for the biggest-ever climate bill \"remains mysterious.\" Bloomberg’s best guess is that \"the uncapped incentives of the Inflation Reduction Act mean spending… could triple initial estimates and push past $1 trillion.\"Much of the bill’s spending comes in the \"form of tax credits that are uncapped,\" reported Bloomberg; there is \"no restriction on how many businesses or citizens can claim new tax incentives made available to support everything from the purchase of electric vehicles to the production of green hydrogen and assembled-in-America batteries.\"See a problem here? As with the $800 billion Payroll Protection Program funding meant to sustain small businesses during COVID, there will almost certainly be massive spillage. Misused PPP funds went to absurdities like taxpayers footing the bill forBarbra Streisand’s gardener, charged with maintaining her $20 million Malibu mansion.Already, multiple business in the EV and battery space have collapsed. EV makers Proterra, Lordstown Motors and Electric Last Mile Solutions have allfiled for bankruptcy; a dozen more companies are hanging by a thread.There will be more failures. The government is a terrible judge of possible commercial success and will disburse billions to worthless causes.  Worse, John Podesta, political apparatchik of the Clinton and Obama White Houses, is in charge of handing out the $380 billion-plus of \"green\" money. Watch to see how much money flows to ventures in toss-up states – those which will decide whether Joe Biden gets a second term.Joe Bidenreceives higher marks on his handling of climate change than on nearly any other issue; 43% approve in a recent CNN survey, but few voters rank the issue high on their list of priorities.John Kerry, the jet-setting climate diplomat who was charged with getting othermajor polluters like Chinaand India to commit to rein in emissions – failed to do that. Turns out those countries prioritize growth and economic success over saving the planet. I wish the Biden White House did the same.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK"
