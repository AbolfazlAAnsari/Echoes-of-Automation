The greenback is just the latest in a series of preferred currencies that have been used for foreign exchange reserves and to denominate other assets. But reserve currencies, unlike diamonds, aren't necessarily forever, and that affects their issuers' capacity to manage their public debt.The British pound was the world's reserve currency in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with a typical exchange rate a century ago of around US$5, vs. US$1.25 per pound today. The pound faded after 1945 because of Britain's massive war debts, the erosion of the British empire and the Allies' choice of the greenback to underpin the fixed exchange rate system negotiated at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in July 1944. Even though that system collapsed in the 1970s, the dollar remains the predominant global currency, accounting for a modest majority of global foreign exchange holdings.Operating a reserve currency has two big advantages to the home country: a relatively strong exchange rate (making imports cheaper and suppressing inflation(https://financialpost.com/tag/inflation/)), and the ability to issue lots of public debt denominated in your own currency at favorable interest rates(https://financialpost.com/news/economy/inflation-rose-july-new-phase-bank-of-canada), which means you don't face foreign exchange risk on it. Investors like reserve currency assets because they perceive overall risk as low, believing strong economies can always find the resources to pay their debts - although just printing money and inflating them away is also an option, albeit a misguided one.Among many Americans, 80 years of the dollar being the world's reserve currency seems to have nurtured a belief that the world has an unlimited demand for U.S. debt so their government can issue unlimited amounts of it. There is even a school of economic thinking - \"Modern Monetary Theory\" - that essentially argues that for a reserve-currency country like the U.S., fiscal deficits and rising public debt simply don't matter, since they can always be financed with bond issues.Given this mindset, which seems especially common in Washington, D.C., it's no surprise that public debt as a share of U.S. GDP has tripled over the past 25 years to around 120 per cent of GDP, much higher than in a typical AAA-rated jurisdiction. Bill Clinton was the last president to balance the books. Neither Republicans nor Democrats are today seized with the need to balance the budget, leading instead to priorities like cutting taxes for Republicans or spending more for Democrats. It is therefore hard to reconcile what investors want to believe about the low risk of holding U.S. dollar assets and the evident unwillingness of both Congress and the four presidents since Clinton to control the public debt. In this absence of leadership, imagine how hard it would be, should the dollar lose its lustre, either to increase taxes or make major spending cuts or both in order to make good on foreign debt service obligations.The Fitch decision to downgrade U.S. public debt a notch has perturbed many conventional economists and financial markets, but it's hardly surprising.
