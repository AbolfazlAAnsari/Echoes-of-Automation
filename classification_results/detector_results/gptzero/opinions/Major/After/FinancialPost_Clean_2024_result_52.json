Our mandate is to promote Indigenous participation in, and benefits from, resource development, which to us includes the tens of thousands of Indigenous people involved in the oil and gas(https://financialpost.com/category/commodities/energy/oil-gas/) sector. We actively work with partners in industry to find win-win solutions - projects that provide well-paying jobs to Indigenous workers and revenues to our communities while advancing best practices in safety and environmental protection.The reason we exist is to provide a voice to Indigenous peoples who work and own businesses in the resource sector. Too often those workers are silenced or shamed. While some Canadians insult our people with stereotypes about being lazy or dependent on welfare, others call us \"corrupt\" or \"sell-outs\" if we work in resource development, be it mining, commercial fishing, forestry or oil and gas.But the fact is these sectors often offer the best opportunities for Indigenous peoples. They are usually geographically close to our communities, build on our knowledge, care for the land and entail legal obligations on industry to work with us in ways that obtain our consent to development.Most of us are practical people. Life in rural and northern communities is different. Getting the energy, building materials and fresh food we need is often expensive and logistically challenging. We are under no illusions that our way of life would be possible without the kinds of resources that come from our territories. And when they are developed responsibly and in partnership with us, we are proud that we can supply these essential items to other Canadians and to people around the world.It seems unlikely that the Angus bill's restrictions on \"persons\" could survive a charter challenge. But its real target is \"producers\" - especially the companies who comprise \"Big Oil.\" But guess what? In some cases, Indigenous communities themselves are the originators and owners of oil and gas projects. We've had production on reserve for decades in places like Kainai Nation, Onion Lake and Whitebear. And now we are seeing Indigenous nations owning natural gas plants, pipelines and LNG terminals.I want to be able to celebrate the success that Indigenous workers and communities are having in negotiating sophisticated business deals, building major projects and providing a better life for the next generation. But what this bill does is try to make us feel ashamed again. Not only would it reinforce that it's wrong to be proud of the way our people contribute to economic reconciliation; it would make expressing such pride illegal.I know many people in Ottawa shrug off this proposed legislation, perhaps as an attention-getting stunt from one of the more imaginative members of Parliament. I also understand it's a private member's bill and unlikely to become law.But for people like me and many of my colleagues, who have been fighting to create a space where Indigenous peoples could get their fair share of benefits from the oil and gas that is extracted and transported across our territories, it is a painful reminder that we are still looked down upon by this country's elites, including some lawmakers.By now most Canadians acknowledge that Indigenous peoples have suffered greatly in this country. I don't need to repeat all the many ways. One of the lingering effects of mistreatment is a sense by many of us that we are \"lesser than,\" and this often causes hopelessness, shame and depression.Brian Mulroney's wisdom on taxes(https://financialpost.com/opinion/brian-mulroney-wisdom-on-taxes-gst)Galbraith's industrial state makes a comeback(https://financialpost.com/opinion/john-kenneth-galbraith-industrial-state-makes-comeback)Ottawa should abolish Indian Act tax exemptions(https://financialpost.com/opinion/ottawa-should-abolish-indian-act-tax-exemptions)At my organization, we are making a point of being proud of other Indigenous workers who have overcome barriers and discrimination to succeed in the resource sector. We will not let anyone take that away, though this bill may try.Financial PostJohn Desjarlais is executive director of the Indigenous Resource Network, an affiliate of Energy for a Secure Future.Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the business news you need to know - add financialpost.com(https://financialpost.com/ ) to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here(https://financialpost.com/newsletters/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2024 Postmedia Network Inc.
