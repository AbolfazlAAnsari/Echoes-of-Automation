Doctors there have been forced to turn away patients, and are not only unable to provide medical care, but are faced with thethreat of jail time, finesandpotentially losing their medical license.A friend in Texas, privileged enough to move her family, left the state when she became pregnant because she was worried she would get subpar care if there was a complication. She was right to be concerned: researchers have documenteddozens of caseswhere patients' health has been compromised in the past year due to abortion bans.Thousands of people in Texas, and millions in other states who have been robbed of their ability to decide whether to continue a pregnancy, will never have their stories told. The consequences in the lives of these women and their families - their health, financial status, emotional state and ability to access essential care - will be felt for generations.These laws worsen the existing health inequities in a country that already has the worst maternal mortality rateamong developed countries. Abortion bans and restrictionsdisproportionately harmmarginalized communities. Patients from rural and Indigenous communities, and patients who face barriers like language, immigration status, income, the ability to take time off work, find child care and more, suffer the harshest consequences of abortion bans. Survivors of sexual assaultare re-traumatizedas they try to overcome obstacles to get abortion care or are forced to remain pregnant.In Montana, where I moved with my family last year, my patients may often have to travel hundreds of miles for care, but at least I'm able to help them get abortions. Montanans valuepersonal liberty, and the state constitution protects the right to individual privacy andpatients' ability to make decisionswith their health care providers without government interference - a bulwark against politicians' continued attempts to restrict abortion access. And as a result of a preliminary injunction from a Montana court, Medicaid in Montanastill covers medically necessary abortions- a lifeline for patients and families who are already just barely getting by.This spring, a woman came to my health center for an abortion. A colleague who had done an intake interview with her stopped me before I walked into the exam room: \"She doesn't want to talk.\" This was an understatement. She had been raped, and when I walked into the room, she seemed both hypervigilant and terrified. She was grateful that I could help her end the pregnancy safely.As providers, we will continue to do everything possible to make sure patients can get the care that they need - but it will take all of us to address this public health crisis and restore, protect and expand abortion access for future generations.Opinion by Samuel DickmanTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
