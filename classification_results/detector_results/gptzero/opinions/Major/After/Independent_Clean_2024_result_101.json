The terriblesituation in the Gaza Striphas meant that the Muslim population there has been fasting for longer than usual, simply because there is no food to eat.This is due to theIsraeli Defence Force(IDF)blocking shipments of food, water, medication, fuel, and just about every other necessity of life, forcing many in Gaza to the brink of starvation.According to reports, there have been at least33,000 Palestinians killed in Gazasince the IDF invaded, following the horrendous attack on Israeli civilians by Hamas terrorists on 7 October, when about 1,200 were killed and 253 taken as hostages.At that time, the IDF was quoted as saying there were 30,000 Hamas fighters in Gaza, of whom they recently claimed to have killed 13,000, although only 113 of them are named. About three-quarters of the fatalities, or about 25,000, are Palestinian women and children, and there is no accounting for how many bodies lie under the rubble.Close to 60 per cent of Gaza’s buildings are destroyed or severely damaged, with the majority of roads and infrastructure blown to smithereens, and 1.7 million Palestinians internally displaced. Many attempts at peace talks resulted in one brief ceasefire, during which 109 hostages were freed.These are a few of many grim figures accumulated during this current war and paint a stark picture when all shown together. The Israeli government is determined to keep its promise to put an end to Hamas in Gaza once and for all. Many countries offered staunch support for Israel six months ago, but are now wavering as the IDF’s declaration to adhere to international rules of war has clearly been ignored. The recentkilling of foreign aid workerscertainly shone a different light on long-standing IDF claims of efficiency and competency.With the end of Ramadan comes three days of celebrations known as Eid al-Fitr, with special prayers, family and community events, etc. But there will be little joy spread among the Muslim faithful in Gaza. Governments in the US and other Western countries that backed Israel to the hilt, are now trying to convince its leaders to back off, finally calling for a ceasefire and using much sterner rhetoric.But at the same time, they aresupplying Israel with bombs, tanks, planes and every other kind of weapon. They should be offering far more to ease suffering and bring an end to this horrendous situation. When it comes down to brass tacks, the leaders from all sides with a stake in what happens to the Palestinians, are looking like a bunch of incompetent hypocrites.Bernie SmithParksvilleGetting off the groundOh, the irony issue of the government being unable to land contracts with willing airlines to deport vulnerable folk toRwanda, where theiraccommodation appears to have been soldoff anyway...Amanda BakerEdinburgh"
