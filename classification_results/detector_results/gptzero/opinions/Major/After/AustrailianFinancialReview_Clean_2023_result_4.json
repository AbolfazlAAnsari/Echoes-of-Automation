            "inputText": "Paula Dwyer,conspiracy theoristBarely five months since her chairmanship of AGL Energy exploded during liftoff, Paula Dwyer has done what almost every businessperson in her position cannot resist doing: publicly raking over the ashes of her misadventure.Hers began as so many of these exercises in self-soothing begin. Dwyer stoically refused to comment on \"the AGL affair\", and then proceeded to bemoan a hypothetical situation almost identical to the AGL affair. \"Unfortunately, we are seeing a focus on playing the person, not the problem,\" she told the February issue of the Australian Institute of Company Directors' in-house magazine.\"This happens in parts of the media and often now among some institutions, which is inconsistent and often damaging just because it misses the point.\"The influence of some commentators - including proxy advisers - on investors can really determine the way they view the world. There's that network effect of people sharing opinions rather than facts, which suddenly gains currency. Sometimes it is the easy way out, but it is not particularly professional. We need to hold ourselves to a higher standard, and the business media has a role to play here.\"Remember, AGL's then-interim chairman Patricia McKenzie had failed to consult shareholders (beyond 11 per cent shareholder Mike Cannon-Brookes) on the board's intention to name Dwyer chairman. When this column revealed it was about to do so, shareholders such as Martin Currie and HESTA were taken aback and warned McKenzie they would join Double Bay Jesus in opposing it.This was a dismal failure of rudimentary investor relations. Institutions (stupid enough to be) on AGL's register, were expected to wait for a puff of white smoke then cop the decree of the conclave. In the real world, boards first seek the opinions of their shareholders on director appointments. They are owners of the company and ultimately get a vote on the matter. Why wouldn't you ask them?Dwyer will not countenance these shareholders' view that her previous chairmanship of Tabcorp was deficient - the lowlights of which were a record AUSTRAC fine, an AGM strike on executive remuneration, integration failure following the Tatts merger, and the indulgence of CEO David Attenborough.And what Dwyer appears to be suggesting is that the business media and/or proxy advisers induced a $30 billion commercial asset manager and a $70 billion industry superannuation fund to act contrary to their interests - or, in her words, to \"miss the point\". The suggestion is ludicrous.She talks sniffily about \"opinions rather than facts\" as if her unimpeachability meets the latter definition and everything else is dubious gossip.There are highly skilled people in Australian equities whose job it is to hold educated opinions on directors' performance, to exercise their judgment on behalf of the people whose savings they manage.Dwyer is really saying their judgment can't be trusted. That's what she's dancing around. She's saying that because they decided she wasn't up to the job, they're not up to their jobs.Here is the typical and deep-seated entitlement of professional company directors who so easily forget they serve at the pleasure of shareholders, not each other. This was the market working.Captains of industry love a competitive market in human performance right up to the moment it applies to them!Dwyer is stuck because she can't simply blame Double Bay Jesus. This wasn't just some grandiose narcissist off his Ritalin. Her repudiation was delivered by serious, respected players in the investment market. That's the part that vexes her self-narrative.She can't cope with their brutal message that she wasn't a suitable candidate for the chairmanship of AGL, so she's made up a different message.She can't attack the messenger. She can't say Grok is full of shit, that Martin Currie doesn't know what it's talking about. So, she invokes a shadowy disinformation campaign by proxy firms or other malign actors opining among themselves. It was a conspiracy. It was a cabal. These are the psychologically safe answers for her.The joke here is that in order to advance her theory of rumourtrage, Dwyer doesn't introduce any supporting facts. She might as well have claimed the Freemasons kiboshed her because she's a Virgo. And the business media should do better?Short-lived disclosurerollback wasn't wastedThe Senate's passing of a motion rolling back the government's attempts to limit how much information superannuation funds provide to members has largely been painted as an embarrassing defeat for Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones.No one - least of all us - would dispute that his failure to hold the Greens to blocking the motion highlights a deficiency of political nous.But in one crucial sense, Jones (regrettably) achieved what was needed. Disallowance aside, the superannuation sector's spending to aid Labor in the last election will likely remain shrouded.The disallowance motion introduced by Jacquie Lambie and passed with the support of the Senate's non-Labor members last week isn't retrospective. For financial years already concluded, the stewards of Australia's compulsorily acquired retirement savings will not have to provide itemised disclosure of their most salacious outflows.This illustrates why Labor's rollback of the Liberals' August 2021 transparency measures was announced with unholy haste on a Friday evening as Jones' very first act as minister last July.Some alarmed submissions aside, the new regulations (which, being regulations, didn't require parliamentary approval), were introduced within the month with only minor changes, allowing superannuation funds to hold annual member meetings with only the barest of spending disclosures.These invariably stated to members that their fund made no direct donations to political parties. Cold comfort for those who realise direct transfers have never been how money moves through the system.Industry superannuation wouldn't have cornered the market if its leaders weren't smart. They wouldn't be caught dead writing a cheque to the Australian Labor Party. But a fund could, say, book an overpriced training seminar with the ACTU, or pay through the nose for an ad in a CFMEU newsletter. Point being: the money gets to a union, which can then donate (or run its own Labor-friendly campaigns) without raising an eyebrow.Superannuation funds are already required to produce itemised disclosures of such payments to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Analysis of these (released in aggregate to this newspaper through an FOI) has previously shown transfers to politically associated entities by superannuation funds peak in the lead-up to election years. But for this cycle, the meetings at which this spending would have been revealed, have overwhelmingly been and gone.For what it's worth, Jones would have you believe the above is \"the longest running scare campaign in the history of superannuation\". In September, he told this newspaper nobody was trying to hide anything, and that those seeking additional information could always just turn up at a superannuation members' meeting and ask.Nonetheless, some weeks later, at AustralianSuper's November 29 meeting, one member took Jones' advice, asking the fund stewarding the retirement of one in 10 Australian workers for \"a table or itemised list\" detailing its promotions, marketing and sponsorship expenditures, as well as their benefit for fund members.\"Colleagues at AustralianSuper are strong supporters of transparency,\" the member was told in the fund's published answer. Though it evidently had no interest in providing any requirements beyond those mandated.The member was instead advised to look at the fund's reports, which do contain a wealth of information, none of which answers the question asked.At least that won't fly next time."
