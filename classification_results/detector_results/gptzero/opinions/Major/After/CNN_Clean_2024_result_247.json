Former President Donald TrumpattackedERIC, falsely, as, \"pump[ing] the rolls for Democrats and do[ing] nothing to clean them up.\" As the 2024 election gets closer, many of these states have no replacement plans.Hot on the heels of these states pulling out of ERIC, several anti-voter, anti-democracy individuals havelaunchedEagleAI NETwork, whichclaimsthat it uses \"AI as well as individual visual comparison of assimilated record data\" to \"scrape\" existing data sources to raise questions about individual voters' eligibility. According tothe Guardian, citing documents obtained through a public records request, one man in Cobb County, Georgia filed at least 176 challenges since December 2023, using a template similar to the one available in EagleAI. The challenges have resulted in numerous removals from county voter rolls, the county elections chair said.This past December, Georgia'sColumbia Countyvotedto beta-testthe software even after the chairman of the State Election Board, William S. Duffey Jr., sent aletterwarning that EagleAI may violate state privacy laws and election statutes. Georgia's elections director, Blake Evans, has expressed his own concerns,noting\"EagleAI draws inaccurate conclusions and then presents them as if they are evidence of wrongdoing.\"According to a document authored by its creator Dr. John Richards, EagleAI purportedly \"uses multi-tiered algorithms\" and \"matching AI\" to search for informationon the internet that could disqualify a voter's registration. But rather than using only official records or documentation, EagleAI's creators claim that it goes as far as to crawl public websites forobituariesand evenchange-of-address formsthat one might file when going on a long vacation. As the Brennan Centerwarns, \"investigators\" can also usesocial media sitesto find if users have posted outside of their home state, where they're registered. Then, Richards claims, the system can start the process of auto-filling challenge forms against voters.This raises many red flags instantly:Voterscould simply be visiting another state; two or more voters could simply share the same name; or voters could already be making changes to their registration that haven't been reflected across every instance of their online footprint. After a voter is flagged, they could have paperwork filed against them challenging their eligibility and be turned away from the polls, or even find themselves not listed on the voter rolls on Election Day. Notably, local PBS station WABE reports that Georgia has been inundated with thousands of challenges filed against individual voters' eligibility since 2021, though the vast majority of these challenges have been dismissed due to lack of evidence. However, a successfully challenged voter would have no idea that this even happened to them until they attempted to exercise their vote.The focus of EagleAI appears not to be election integrity, but systematic voter disenfranchisement. As the Brennan Centerputsit, \"...it's an attack on voters.\"We can and should use new tech to our advantage - this is an ideal upon which Vote.org was created. In the future, AI could help identify busy polling locations and alternative options for voters on Election Day. It could be a research aid, identifying best practices to encourage voter participation. It could help streamline how voters update their own registration. It should not be used for shrinking the pool of eligible voters. That is voter suppression branded under a trendy moniker.As defenders of democracy, we have to anchor our work in expanding the electorate, not shrinking it. In the 2020 election, two-thirds of eligible voterscasta ballot. In 2022, that number was 46%. These are relatively high rates, but show the gap in eligibility versus turnout. We should be simplifying voting to bring more people into the process, not targeting those who are exercising their rights. We can only do this if we keep our eye on these types of anti-voter ploys from every angle. As our world becomes more technologically advanced, so too will the threats facing it.Opinion by Andrea HaileyTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
