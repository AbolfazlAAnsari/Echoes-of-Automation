Following the unrest at the1968 Democratic National Conventionin Chicago, theMcGovern-Fraser Commissionguided the Democrats toward a new approach that would place a heavier weight on primary votes from the general public, rather than support from party delegates, in choosing the nominee.Republicans followed suit in 1976.While intended to give voters more say in the nomination process, many scholarsagreethat the democratization of the presidential primary has contributed to increased political polarization. Single-issue groups, from gun rights to abortion, have taken a larger role in the primary process, marginalizing the influence of party officials to watch out for their institution's long-term interest. Conventions, once a site of wheeling and dealing between different factions in a party to choose a nominee, are nowpublic relations showcases- vestigial appendages that bear little resemblance to their original function.Without reform, primaries in which voters aren't given real choices - or in which candidates with high name recognition flaunt the established rules - may soon follow that path to obsolescence.With two historically unpopular candidates in Trump and Biden seemingly headed for a repeat of 2020's contest, both the Republican and Democratic parties had some incentives to shift strategy. Not nominating Trump on the one hand, or Biden on the other, could have given either party the ability to turn the page on the era of baby boomer electoral dominance and offer general election voters a fresh face to tackle contemporary challenges.But neither party is strong enough to act in its own long-term self-interest, beholden to the fundraising might and political firepower each leading contender brings to the table. As this year's slog showcases, a primary system with no authority other than the ballot box can lead to misaligned incentives for the health of each party - and our democracy.All primaries do is offer a democratic way of determining who is the most popular candidate among voters who show up on a random day months before Election Day. That can be - but is certainly not always - the same candidate who will do well when voters in a general election are paying attention.Primaries attractthe most ideologically committed voters, who in turn choose candidates who are more inclined to appeal to the edges rather than voters in the middle. Taking some democracy out of the primary process could mean more meaningful competition in general elections - over the long term, a win for small \"d\" democracy.We've seen some alternatives to what a back-to-the-future approach to nominating processes could look like. \"Superdelegates,\" or party officials with an automatic vote in the delegate count, used to be empowered to act in ways that didn't automatically follow the will of the voters. But they have been reined in over time. Parties could resurrect their original function, rather than having them serve as a rubber stamp.Another approach was demonstrated in 2021 when Virginia Republicanseschewed a direct primaryfor a nominating convention. There, party leaders selected Glenn Youngkin as their most electable gubernatorial candidate - in retrospect,a savvy choice.The smoke-filled rooms of the conventions of yesteryear aren't coming back. But finding ways to resurrect some of that spirit - with nominees at least partially selected with an eye toward their ability to communicate with voters outside the most committed activists - could be a way of getting ourselves out of the farce of primary elections that purport to offer voters influence but instead offer confusion.Opinion by Patrick T.
