For instance, ObamaCare and Medicaid plans are notorious for long wait times for appointments and narrow provider networks that often leave out the best doctors. LooseningObamaCare’s onerous coverage ruleswould allow plans to specialize, partner with centers for excellence, and give more Americans coverage for the high-quality care they need. Making room for association health plans, cost-sharing, and direct contracting options would also give more Americans the ability to get high-quality care at a price they can afford.The same goes with the reform of certificate of need laws that limit the number of health care providers in an area. We conservatives tend to talk about reforming these laws to promote competition to lower prices. We should also emphasize that it is the poorest Americans who suffer the most from fewer providers, and reform would give more people access to care.Conservatives can address the American people’s desire for consistency and standards in health care with clear national quality benchmarks but allow state and local interpretation and enforcement to avoid one size fits all rules. Section 1332 innovation waivers and the deference the Trump administration gave to states inresponding to COVID-19provide possible models.Conservatives should also embrace a strategy that we at the America First Policy Institute have adopted, \"radical incrementalism\" – small but important changes that, over time, add up to large-scale change.Price transparency in health care is a perfect example. It is an issue with over 90% favorability that could dramatically change the convoluted third-party payer system with all its middlemen driving up costs and adding confusion. However, it will do so organically and over time by patients and doctors making independent decisions, not through the designs of central planners in Washington.The big government approach to health care is replete with failures that heighten health inequality and lead to more confusion and frustration. Conservative health care solutions that put patients and doctors back in charge are the cure to the mess big government has created. It’s time for we conservatives to take the moral and political high ground in health care by emphasizing how our solutions don’t just save money, but more importantly, save lives.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICHCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM BOBBY JINDALBobby Jindal was the governor of Louisiana from 2008-2016 and a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.
