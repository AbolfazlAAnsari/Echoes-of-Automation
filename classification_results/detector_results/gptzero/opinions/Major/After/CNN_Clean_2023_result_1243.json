Viewmore opinionon CNN.Dear Rep. Stefanik:Last weekyou challenged Ivy League presidentsto denounce antisemitism with \"moral clarity\" by answering some yes/no questions. Dissatisfied with their answers, you have agitated for their removal.University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magillstepped down after fierce criticism of her testimony on Capitol Hill, whileHarvard University President Claudine GayandMIT President Sally Kornbluthhave faced similar calls to resign for their own legalistic and tone-deaf answers to your questions about people \"calling for the genocide of Jews.\"We can all agree that the college presidents who appeared before your committee failed basic tests of common sense and \"moral clarity\" when they struggled to answer your yes-no questions. But your sharply focused inquiry now invites a broader discussion about the moral responsibilities of leadership when confronting antisemitism. What do you think about tolerance for antisemitism by people who want to be president-not of a college in New England but of the United States itself?Following your simple yes/no format, I present five easy questions for you to address with \"moral clarity\" on presidential tolerance for-and indeed active embrace of-antisemitism. (Please avoid all the waffling, evasion and equivocation you rightfully denounced in the college presidents.)1. Is a candidate qualified to be presidentwho hosted at his homefor dinner Nick Fuentes, an avowedlypro-Hitler,Holocaust revisionistcalling for a \"holy war\" against the Jewish people, and Kanye West, who vowed to go \"death con 3\" against Jews? Yes or no, Ms. Stefanik?2. Will you support for president a candidate who proclaimed that there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of theantisemitic and racist riotthat took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017? Yes or no, Ms. Stefanik? To refresh your memory, this was the violence that began with neo-Nazis chanting \"Jews will not replace us\" outside a local synagogue and ended with the murder ofHeather Heyerby aviolent white supremacist in a car.3. Would you support a presidential candidate whose final 2016 TV ad pairedimages of George Soros, Lloyd Blankfein and Janet Yellen, three prominent Jews, with voice-over about \"global special interests\" who \"don't have your good in mind\"?

Do you regretendorsing Donald Trumpfor president in 2016 just days after he tweetedan image of the Star of David superimposed over Hillary Clinton's faceand a thick pile of cash?
