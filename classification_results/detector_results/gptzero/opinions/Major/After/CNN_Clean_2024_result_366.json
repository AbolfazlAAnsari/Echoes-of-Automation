Hezbollah also bombed the Marine barracks building in Beirut,killing 241 American service members.Those attacks by Hezbollah achieved their aim. The Reagan administration pulled all US forces out of Lebanon. A wealthy young Saudi fundamentalist named Osama bin Laden was watching closely: He concluded that if you applied enough military pressure on the Americans, they would pull out of the Middle East.After bin Laden's al Qaeda attacked the US on September 11, 2001, the Americans effectively handed the Iranians a big gift, which was the 2003 overthrow of their mortal enemy, the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, against whom Iran had fought a ruinous,almost-decade-long warduring the 1980s.Following the fall of Saddam, Iraq was wracked by a civil war that killed hundreds of thousands. Iranintroducedinto the Iraqi war zone highly effective roadside bombs known as EFPs - Explosively Formed Penetrators - that wounded and killed hundreds of American soldiers. In 2011, the USwithdrewfrom Iraq.The official US Army history of the Iraq War concluded that Iran was the only winner of that war. This wasn't the conclusion of vocal war critic Noam Chomsky but of a group of soberUS Army historians.Iran's 'cookie-cutter approach'Norman Roule was the top US intelligence official on Iran from 2008 to 2017. Roule observed to me for the \"In the Room\"podcastthat \"Iran uses a cookie-cutter approach across the region, but the dough in each country is different, and the cooking time is different.\"In Syria, acivil warbegan in 2011, and Iran saw another opportunity for this cookie-cutter approach by propping up the regime of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad with billions of dollars of aid as well as Iranian advisers and Hezbollah forces on the ground fighting for the Assad regime.That explains the continued presence in Damascus today of senior Iranian military leaders and advisers like the ones who were killed by theIsraeli airstrikeon April 1 that precipitated Iran's missile and drone barrage against Israel on Saturday.In Yemen, the Houthis started fighting the central government, and - particularly after Iran's rival for regional dominance, the Saudis, intervened in the Yemeni war in 2015 - Irantrained the Houthis and supplied themwith missiles and drones. These are the same weapons that the Houthis have beenusing against shipsin the Red Sea, effectively closing the shipping route to and from the Suez Canal and cutting off a critical route for global trade.And then there is Hamas. While Iran had no foreknowledge of Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, according toChristine Abizaid, the director of the US National Counterterrorism Center,Iran has supplied Hamaswith hundreds of millions of dollars for weapons and training, according to the US Treasury Department.Iran'sproxiesin the Middle East, to one degree or another, now exert significant influence on Gaza, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. These proxies are grandiloquently known as\"the axis of resistance\"to Israel and the United States, and they exert their influence on a region that extends 1,500 miles from the north in Lebanon to Yemen's Red Sea coast in the south. And now the Iranians are closer than ever to having nuclear weapons.The most significant foreign policy blunder of the Trump administration was pulling out of theIranian nuclear dealinked by the Obama administration, which was preventing the Iranians from enriching uranium above around 4%; you need around 90%enrichment of uraniumfor a nuclear device. Before former President Donald Trump reneged on the deal, Iran was observing the terms of the nuclear agreement, according toTrump's own intelligence chiefs. Today, the Iraniansreportedlyhave enough highly enriched uranium for three weapons and are considered closer than ever to having a workable nuclear weapon.'Deemed concluded'?Saturday's drone and missile attacks against Israel were designed to show Israel and the region that the Iranian regime can't be trifled with, and the Israeli attack on its military leaders in Damascus would be avenged. However, it might not trigger a major war since 99% of the 300 drones and missiles launched by Iranwere intercepted, according to the Israeli military. It's likely that Iran's theocratic regime, which has faced majorinternal protestsand is approaching agenerational transition, wanted to respond to calls for retribution for the Damascus attack withouttriggering a major warwith two superior militaries - that of the US and Israel.The Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York released astatementas Iran's attacks were in progress, saying they had now responded to the strike against \"our diplomatic premises in Damascus\" and \"the matter can be deemed concluded.\"That, of course, doesn't mean that Israel will deem the matter concluded. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who hasn't achieved his strategic objectives in Gaza of wiping out Hamas militarily and returning the 100 or so hostages held by Hamas, and is alsonot well-likedby most Israelis, can surely benefit from a rally-around-the-flag effect by casting himself as an assertive wartime leader. Of course, the Israeli public may also demand action to restore deterrence against Iran, having just lived through a barrage of Iranian missile and drone strikes.So, despite President Joe BidencallingNetanyahu on Saturday night to tell him that Iran's attack hadn't succeeded and saying the US wouldn't support any counterattack, it would hardly be in character for Netanyahu not to respond in some fashion against Iran.And here is where things might get even worse as the burgeoning regional conflict that the Biden administration has long tried to avoid is now in higher gear, and it's unclear where everyone's red lines are and what might trigger a major war with Iran.As Abizaid noted in an interview for mypodcastbefore Saturday's attack by Iran, the issue is that \"everyone has sort of a loose understanding of what these red lines might be, and events could change your perception of whether one of those has been crossed at any given time.\"The Iraq factorOn Monday, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani will meet with Biden at the White House. Themeetingcomes at a time when there is considerable pressure in Iraq to withdraw the 2,500 US troops who remain there on an anti-ISIS mission.The withdrawal of the US troops from neighboring Iraq is a key goal of Iran, whichexerts considerable influenceover some Iraqi politicians.This poses adilemmafor both the Iraqi government and the Biden administration since the US troops based in Iraq have been frequent targets of Iranian-backed militias since the Gaza war started. While these attacks stopped following thekilling of three US soldiersby anIranian-backed militiain Jordan in January, if conflict were to start heating up with Iran, those attacks against US bases in Iraq could resume.Balanced against that is that the last time the US pulled all its forces out of Iraq was in 2011, and within three years, ISIS hadtaken over much of the country, a history that the vast majority of Iraqis do not want to repeat.It will be interesting to see whether, given the increasingly bellicose stance of the Iranians, the Biden administration puts considerable pressure on the Iraqi prime minister to keep those US soldiers on the ground in Iraq.Opinion by Peter BergenTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
