He survived, but the shooterkilled four students and wounded seven other peopleat Oxford High, the worst school shooting in Michigan's history.Overnight, our family joined a tragic affinity group of Americans directly connected in some way to a mass shooting, a group whosenumber expands year after year.What has happened since the shooting has been a regular subject of national headlines, including on Tuesday, whenthe parents of the shooter were sentencedin the case, after being convicted of manslaughter at separate trials. The judgehanded down a sentence of 10-15 years in prison, including time served, with 15 years being the maximum allowable under state sentencing guidelines.It wasa historic verdictin which the parents of a mass shooter were held legally responsible, after a first-of-its-kind prosecution under the theory of gross negligence.

He was sentenced in December tolife in prison without the possibility for parole.The convictions of the shooter's parents, and Tuesday's sentencing, set a potentially powerful precedent. But they are both too much, and not enough. They're too much because the systems designed to support parents and teens in crisis failed too, in part, because they arenot adequately funded.And they're not enough because laying these failures at the feet of the shooter and his parents and removing this family from society does little to incentivize school officials, lawmakers and taxpayers to correct the systemic failures contributing to the behavior being punished.And while there are civil suits against the gun store ownersandcertain school officialsstill pending, it is unclear whether that legal action will ultimately provide any remedy in terms of compensation or deterrence.As relatives whose loved one has suffered harm from gun violence, we have witnessed and been subjected to pressure to seek vengeance and to hate the shooter and his parents.

This simple solution hits close to home: We know that the parents of the school shooter in Oxford claimed to have stored the firearm used in the incident safely, but the passcode on the device was 0-0-0 -the default combinationset by the manufacturer, according to the detective who testified at the trial of the shooter's father.At the school and community level, robust interdisciplinary threat assessment teams should be created in every county in every state, offering a multi-pronged approach to prevent future harm. These units could encompass mental health concerns in concert with community partners in education and law enforcement, as well as social work professionals to identify potential threats to the community and find constructive interventions.Such threat assessment teams can also suggestrestorative justice-based intervention strategies for people who have perpetrated or might be susceptible to perpetrating harm. When properly implemented,restorative justice methodologieshave proven to be effective inimproving school climates and reducing student misbehavior. It's an approach focused on accountability for one's actions, promoting students' social-emotional growth, and supporting and reinforcing positive behaviors in schools.At least one other parent of a survivor of the shooting in Oxford joined a threat assessment team at her workplace in a neighboring school district andlamented the missed opportunitythat properly implemented threat assessment teams can offer.Anindependent investigationconducted after the shooting concluded that had proper threat assessment guidelines been in place, the shooting tragedymight have been avoided.The 572-page report investigating the shooting concluded that the school district should have conducted an assessment of the potential threat posed by the gunman on the day of the shooting.We think that it's also important to place less emphasis on solutions that at best, deliver mixed results. It's very tempting to lean into the promises marketed by security companies making a profit from our fear. Metal detectors, expensive bulletproof glass and clear backpacks may provide a veneer of security for some, but they're far from sufficient. We need to join with others who are advocating for additional financial support for the public school system that shoulders the burden of gaps in the social safety net.We didn't ask to have this platform. Now that we are here, we hope to work with others to slow the numbers of families who join us and other survivors every day. But we simply cannot prosecute our way out of community violence in an overburdened and expensive criminal justice system thatdisproportionately targetscommunities of color.A verdict might make another parent think twice about their personal firearm safety practices or their child's mental health and well-being, but it's a peer, friend or family member who can provide the accountability to turn thought into preventative action.Together we can do what the criminal justice system cannot; we can educate each other, support each other and hold each other accountable as family members and as a community to prevent community gun violence.We possess the tools to create meaningful and lasting change and healing after the pain and loss of gun violence, no matter how steep the climb or how heavy the task.Opinion by Mary Mueller and Sarah RogersonTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
