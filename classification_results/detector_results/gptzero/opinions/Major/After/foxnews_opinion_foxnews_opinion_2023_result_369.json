MI5 Director General Ken McCallum also shared in a separate joint appearance with Wray that his agency is now running seven times more investigations into Chinese operations than it was in 2018.TheCCP is spreading its espionageefforts throughout our agriculture industry, education systems, TikTok, Wall Street, and much more.With this spy balloon, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping wanted to dare the Biden administration to something about it. Instead, our government dithered. Xi tested the political will to respond and we failed. The Washington Postreportedthat China has deployed similar balloons in the past over Hawaii and Gaum. Clearly Beijing deployed one over our ICBM fields in the US mainland because they believed they could get away with it.China's President Xi Jinping looks on as he attends a session during the G-20 Summit in Nusa Dua on the Indonesian resort island of Bali on Nov. 16, 2022.(Willy Kurniawan/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)CHINA SPY BALLOON SHOWS COUNTRY IS PREPARING CITIZENS FOR WAR THAT COULD COME AT ‘ANY TIME’: EXPERTConcerningly, Bloomberg reported, \"U.S. authorities were well aware of the unidentified object that had entered American airspace on Jan. 28, that had then left and re-entered over North Idaho on Tuesday.\"But due to a planned trip bySecretary of State Anthony Blinkento Beijing this week, the administration was dead set on \"keeping it on the down-low.\"Weakness is provocative and that has been on display for the entirety of this administration.The number one job of the federal government is to keep its citizens safe. Even CCP public relations stunts like this have grave consequences in sending a message to the rest of the world that the U.S. refused to act over a very visible, non-lethal spy balloon.Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during a press conference at the Waldorf Astoria in Jerusalem on Jan. 31, 2023.(Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP via Getty Images)China has a plan for global dominance and is executing it with little pushback from our government.Had Biden wanted to send a real message to Beijing, they should have rerouted Blinken’s trip from Beijing to Taipei.I hope this balloon serves as a wakeup call for our country. We can no longer be complacent with China’s rise because so many institutions are making money in the Chinese market.This brazen act by the CCP should be a catalyst - much like the Sputnik launch - for all Americans to accept the sobering reality that the Communist government in China is in a new cold war with the United States.President Biden, with son Hunter Biden, arrives at Hancock Field Air National Guard Base in Syracuse, New York, on Feb. 4, 2023.(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images)Because of China’s growing military, economic and technological might, we cannot just assume we will win this time.With the admission from the Biden administration last week that thePentagon was indeed trackinga Chinese spy balloon over Montana, I was shocked to discover we had simply allowed our greatest adversary to completely violate our sovereignty and airspace.Much like Sputnik, this balloon didn’t pose any physical threat to those on the surface.
