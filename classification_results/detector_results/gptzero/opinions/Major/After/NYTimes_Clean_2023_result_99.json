Pamela Paul argues for a meritocratic system in research, but given that academic research is governed by peer review (a deeplyflawedandbiasedsystem), and given the frequentirreproducibilityof scientific findings, what we have now is nowhere close to a meritocracy or absolute objectivity.As scientists we need the humility to admit that we are in desperate need of an influx of new ideas and new ways to improve research. Those come with new and diverse people. Science cannot be objective until we correct this.Yonathan GoldtzvikCambridge, EnglandThe writer is a postdoctoral researcher at University College London.To the Editor:Pamela Paul seems either unaware of or unbothered by the ways in which science has been used to marginalize and harm vulnerable communities, and her dismissal of the need to address systemic bias in science is unfounded.Scientific racism, for example, is sadly not a historical relic. The field of human behavioral genetics thrives on publishing papers clinging to the notion that group differences (read: racial differences) exist in intelligence and other measures of ability, despite countless studies undermining such conclusions. Perhaps not coincidentally, most of the researchers who conduct these studies are white (and predominantly male), and their work has attracted great enthusiasm in the white nationalist community.Payton Gendron, the perpetrator of the 2022 Buffalo massacre, cited the work of leading scientific proponents of innate racial differences. There is a direct connection between this discredited science and violent extremism.Obviously, the ideology and opinions of scientists affect the questions they ask and the answers they seek. Diversifying scientific fields is the key to addressing bias in the kinds of studies that are performed.David SepkoskiUrbana, Ill.The writer is a historian of science at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana.This article appeared in print on page SR11."
