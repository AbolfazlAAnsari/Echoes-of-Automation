On the rise are the programs of Asia,most notably Chinaand India. Both countries have developed sophisticated cryogenic rocket engines, launchers and spacecraft. Both operate several constellations of satellites for communication, Earth imaging and remote sensing, and Chinahas its own navigation satellite constellation.China also boasts a human spaceflight programwith an operational space station, including crew and cargo transport spacecraft. Indiahas plans to send its own astronauts into orbit in the next few years, while China has announced plans tosend its astronauts to the lunar surface in the 2030s.China's lunar rover is still actively exploring the far side of the Moon,the only country so far to have placed a lander there.In the International Space Station (ISS) partnership, the US, Europe, Japan and Canada also continue to move forward with space exploration. After years of delay and cost overruns, theArtemis I missionwas finally launched last year and NASA has named theArtemis II crewwhich includes a Canadian astronaut. NASA plans to return humans to the Moon in the coming years, something that hasn't happened since the last Apollo landing in 1972.These countries also continue to launch satellites and other spacecraft. NASA continues, meanwhile, to operate rovers on Mars. And one of the most exciting developments in the West are the partnerships between commercial space companies and NASA.SpaceX has been a NASA partner for many years, sending supplies and crew to the ISS. They are also developing a lunar lander for NASA, as is a team led by billionaire Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin. Several smaller companies are participating in contracts to provide spacecraft and services for lunar exploration, in what is proving to be a relentless forward push into space on multiple fronts.Russia is the one exception. Instead of expanding,its space program has been in decline for several years. The once-great program began disintegrating after the fall of the Soviet Union and the downward spiral now appears to be accelerating. Cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev wasstranded on the Mir space station for nearly a yearbecause of the collapse of the Soviet Union and immediate chaos that followed.Their program was arguably saved by the US, which supported the Mir space station andbrought Russia into what became the ISS program, with cash for services and contracts to produce the core modules and other equipment.Make no mistake, Russia has also been a key partner in the ISS program. They have provided crew and cargo transportation (including for my crew during Expedition-10), while the Space Shuttle was grounded after theColumbia accident.Until recently, Russian rockets and spacecraft were among the most safe and reliable. But now the future of Russia's space program is in doubt, amid continuing funding cuts,allegations of corruption(for example, thescandals related to the building of the Vostochny launch complex), politicization (for instance thereign of former Roscosmos director, career-politician Dmitry Rogozin), and the lack of young professionals in their pipeline (the low-paying jobs are not attractive toprospective workers.)In recent years, Russia has seen failures of Soyuz and Progress spacecraft and launchers, including the 2018 launch abort of Soyuz MS-10 which hadUS astronaut Nick Hague onboard. Luna-25 is just the latest in a string of failures. Thankfully, none of these has yet resulted in any deaths or injuries.Russia's bedraggled space program mirrors the state of the nation itself, including thesurprisingly poor performance of the Russian military in its war on Ukraine. Instead of making his nation a \"great power\" again, Putin has shown the world just how badly Russia is in decline.The lamentable state of Moscow's space program is just the latest confirmation of that.Opinion by Leroy ChiaoTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
