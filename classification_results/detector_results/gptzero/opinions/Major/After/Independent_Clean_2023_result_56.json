Moreover, my home town of Worthing in West Sussex developed through the production of tomatoes and grapes during the late Victorian period.The writer is correct in saying that it is big business that seems to dictate what and where groceries are to be produced. When a production area is deemed to be too expensive, big business moves on to the next cheaper area of production area and so on. When did you last see tomatoes fromthe Canary Islands? Or from Guernsey?I blame supermarkets, as well as Brexit, for theshortages in shops.  Supermarkets’ obsession with profit margins has led the cost of certain goods to sore far too high. Brexit has only added to the misery with the endless red tape around trade.Eamon CrouchAddress supplied"
