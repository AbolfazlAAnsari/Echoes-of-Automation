            "inputText": "At COP28(https://www.cop28.com/ ) this weekend, the Paris Agreement, the world's framework to address climate change, will be top of mind. Canada and 194 other countries have signed it, but is it getting us where we want to go? It was meant to lower global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and encourage international cooperation. In fact, Paris has been an obstacle to the biggest emissions reduction opportunity currently available: international trade in which low-emissions energy would displace high-emissions energy.Canada has liquefied natural gas (LNG) that we could sell to our allies in Asia to displace their significant use of higher-emitting fuels, particularly coal. According to recent papers by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce(https://chamber.ca/news/canada-and-global-energy-security-the-role-of-natural-gas-in-a-lower-carbon-future/), the Business Council of Canada(https://thebusinesscouncil.ca/report/innovate-compete-and-win/), my own organization(https://energysecurefuture.ca/paper/canadas-lng-opportunity-a-value-proposition-worth-celebrating) and many others, the emission reductions that would result from this switch would dwarf any domestic actions Canada could take. But, ironically, the Paris Agreement doesn't encourage such action.Under the agreement, each country commits to a nationally determined contribution or \"NDC\" - the amount by which they will reduce their domestic emissions. When countries report on progress, they report on their domestic progress. If their domestic emissions go up, they have failed to \"make their contribution.\" Not even if, say, Indonesia's emissions decrease thanks to its importing low-emitting Canadian LNG.Canada has lots of natural gas to export, but with current technologies, producing and exporting it would raise our domestic emissions, at least temporarily. Today, roughly half(https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-co2-fuel) of global emissions come from fuels that are higher-emitting than natural gas. Exporting Canadian LNG to replace these fuels could therefore involve Canada in tackling half the world's emissions problem; our domestic contribution is currently 1.5 per cent. A good thing, right? No. As currently applied, the Paris Agreement will say we failed if we miss our domestic targets, no matter how much we help out globally. According to one estimate, Canadian LNG exports could deliver 680 MT(https://chamber.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Canada_and_Global_Energy_Security_March_2023.pdf) a year in global emissions reductions - which is more than Canada's total annual emissions of 672 MT. But if our domestic emissions go up at all, we will have missed our target, according to Paris.Environmental groups say British Columbia's emissions will rise by 13 MT(https://policyalternatives.ca/bc-carbon-conundrum#:~:text=The%20British%20Columbia%20government%20has%20pledged%20to%20reduce,the%20currently%20forecasted%20oil%20and%20gas%20production%20levels. ) if we pursue LNG exports. Even if we accept this figure, how serious are we about emissions reductions if we forgo a reduction of 680 MTs - an entire Canada's worth of emissions - to prevent an increase of just 13 MT?Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which allows countries to trade credits for emission reductions in one country enabled by the energy or technology of another country, was meant to address this problem. Under this provision, if Canada provides a country, like India, with guaranteed LNG supply that allows it to close its highest emission coal-fired facilities, the emission reduction achieved in India can be shared with Canada. A total reduction of 50 MT could be split between the two countries, with each, for example, reporting a decrease of 25 MT toward their respective NDC.To be eligible for this type of crediting, Paris rules require that the reductions fulfill \"additionality(https://macdonaldlaurier.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/20231018_LNG-Carbon-Credit-Gessaroli_PAPER-v3.pdf) requirements.\" Additionality considers whether the emissions-reducing action - buying Canadian LNG and substituting out a higher-emitting fuel - would have taken place in the absence of the availability of emissions credits. This requirement is currently understood to make LNG trade ineligible for Article 6 credits because LNG projects that are commercially viable on their own \"would have happened anyway\".At the same time, being commercially viable is a requirement for people to invest in, build and derive the environmental benefits from LNG projects. Is this understanding of \"additionality\" benefiting Canada or our allies? It is certainly not helping us build the projects the world needs.Not every country has the resources to hit its emissions targets while meeting other important goals like ending energy poverty, creating good jobs or ensuring geopolitical coherence. Many countries around the world, including China and India, are using high-emission fuels and will continue to do so(https://www.iea.org/news/global-coal-demand-set-to-remain-at-record-levels-in-2023) unless they have good alternatives like Canadian LNG. And, for the record, some countries are already trading emissions credits(https://www.mofa.go.jp/ic/ch/page1we_000105.html) with other countries to create win-wins.Terence Corcoran: Court exposes the junk science of plastics ban(https://financialpost.com/opinion/court-exposes-junk-science-liberals-plastics-ban)Opinion: Net-zero policies colliding with economic reality(https://financialpost.com/opinion/net-zero-policies-colliding-economic-reality)Terence Corcoran: The folly of Liberals' telco and power plans(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-the-folly-of-the-trudeau-liberals-telco-and-power-plans)Policies or politics in Canada that prevent growth of our LNG exports without international credits will result in global emissions being higher and rising faster. Viewed this way, all the emissions reductions from Canadian LNG are \"additional\": the alternative is projects not happening and significant global emissions growth.LNG is our best solution for large global emissions reductions and the Paris framework does not encourage it. COP28 should be a chance for us and our potential customers to fix it.Shannon Joseph is chair of Energy for a Secure Future(http://www.energysecurefuture.ca/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
