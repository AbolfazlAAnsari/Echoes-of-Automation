Going back to Bass, while calling for the watering down of the qualifications needed to become a police officer in that failing city, she also pledged to root out officers with ties to \"right-wing domestic extremist organizations.\"This trend is also taking firm hold among certain airlines in both the United States and the European Union. Pilots should be hired and then put on the flight deck based only upon their superior qualifications.By the same token, candidates who do prove themselves highly qualified but don't happen to check the correct \"identity politics\" box at the time should not be overlooked, or in reality, discriminated against. Only the best should be in positions where the lives of others are at stake.To reiterate, if that person who is clearly the best of the best happens to be Black, White, brown, gay, straight, trans, female, male, liberal, conservative, of any faith, or no faith … give them the job. She or he has earned it.Perilously, the Planet \"Woke\" seems to be getting more divorced from common sense and pragmatic thinking with each passing day. Counterintuitively to be sure when you stop to realize that those pushing identity politics over qualifications must fly occasionally.  Or may find themselves in the need of a police officer, afirefighter or a doctor.Don't they want those pilots, police officers, firefighters and doctors to be the most-qualified possible?Surreal times.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DOUG MACKINNONDouglas MacKinnon is a former White House and Pentagon official and author of the book:\"The 56 – Liberty Lessons from those who risked all to sign The Declaration of Independence.\""
