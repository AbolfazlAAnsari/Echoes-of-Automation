I miss that kind of clarity.\"The Democrats may soon have the same lament. We have too many scandals to number, but what they will miss most after the discovery ofhighly classified documentsin the president's former private office is the clarity.  With the discovery, Democrats have lost the clarity and separation with former President Trump. There are clear differences in the two scandals, but those differences could be lost in the echo of Biden's own words on the mishandling of classified material.Last year,President Bidenwas asked by CBS' Scott Pelley on \"60 Minutes,\" \"When you saw the photograph of the top secret documents laid out on the floor at Mar-a-Lago, what did you think to yourself looking at that image?\"Biden seemed to struggle to control his disgust: \"How that could possibly happen, how one anyone could be that irresponsible. And I thought what data was in there that may compromise sources and methods.\"BIDEN ONCE DEFENDED TAKING HOME CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS, SAID IT 'DEPENDS ON THE DOCUMENT'Washington is in full spin control with pundits who previously said that even amisdemeanor conviction of Trumpshould bar him from ever running again for federal office.Again, there are distinctions, but we still do not know the full facts, including whether additional classified material has been previously returned or whether additional material may be located in other offices. Nevertheless, there is no allegation of false statements or obstruction.What is most striking is how this could have easily been far, far worse if the Bidens had gotten their way on the alternative office that was discussed following their departure from government. Rather than the Penn Center, their effective landlord would have been Chinese.Attorney General Merrick Garland is again evading his most difficult obligation to show total independence from his president.For those of us who have followed the Biden influence peddling scandal, one of the benefits that Joe Biden was supposed to receive from Chinese associates was an office that he would use regularly.10 UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT BIDEN'S CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTSIn 2017,Hunter Biden askedthat keys be made for his new \"office mates,\" listing his father, Joe Biden, Jill Biden and his uncle, Jim Biden. He said that they planned to share the space with Gongwen Dong, whom he described as an \"emissary\" for Chairman Ye Jianming -- the chairman of CEFC Chinese Energy Co.  Hunter Biden also asked for set of keys of Gongwen Dong. The manager was even asked to change the names on the front door to include Joe and Jill Biden.The arrangement appears to have fallen to the wayside with other aspects of the Chinese deals. Instead, the Bidens found another source at theUniversity of Pennsylvaniato cover their office needs.What is not known is whether some of this classified material was relevant to Biden's book and his lectures on diplomacy, raising the possibility that he worked with the documents on computers or discussed them with third parties. In the meantime, they apparently sat in a closet, easy pickings for any intelligence service.While the media continues to dismiss the influence peddling investigation as, in the words this weekend of NBC's Chuck Todd, a \"personal\" attack, it is far more serious as a form of corruption due to an array of dangers from such access. The millions given to Hunter Biden came from a variety of foreign sources, including some coming from figures tied to foreign intelligence. This money not only gained influence butaccess to the Bidens.BIDEN IGNORES REPORTERS' QUESTIONS ABOUT CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS FOR 2ND TIME AS STAFF ESCORTS MEDIA OUTHunter himself stated that foreign intelligence used hotel rooms to steal his files. A videotape purportedly shows Biden claiming that one of his laptops was stolen by Russians for blackmail purposes.Putting aside the lack of media interest in Biden's claim, there is no information on any investigation by the FBI that blackmail material may have been acquired on the Bidens.The danger of influence peddling is that it is not only the preferred avenue for corruption in Washington, but it often allows dangerous levels of access to targeted leaders.Even if the public dodged this danger on the Chinese-funded office, it was not due to any lack of effort by the Bidens. The question now is how the public can feel confident that the FBI will show the same vigor in investigating the Bidens as it did Trump.Attorney General Merrick Garlandknows that many citizens no longer trust the government and his current position will only deepen those misgivings. There is growing unease over the litany of controversies over political bias at the FBI, including calls for a new \"Church Committee\" to look into reforms.At the same time, Garland has maintained an incomprehensible position inrefusing to appoint a special counselto investigate the Biden influence peddling controversy and other issues. He has done so despite clear evidence that the president had lied in denying any knowledge of his son's foreign dealings and repeated references to the president getting a possible cut or benefits (including the Chinese-funded office) from the deals.Garland's position now borders on the comical. He announced that he was compelled to appoint a special counsel on the Mar-a-Lago and other possible offenses by Trump after he officially became acandidate for the 2024 presidential election. At the time, some of us noted that Biden is actually the president but Garland was steadfastly refusing to make such an appointment.Now Biden stands accused of the same underlying offense as Mar-a-Lago. While there have not been false statement or obstruction claims raised, it is unclear what allegations will emerge. More importantly, the offense of unlawfully removing and storing classified information is the same. Yet, Garland again refused to appoint a special counsel and will keep the matter within theDOJ rank-and-file.Biden can count on every possible consideration and accommodation from the media. The public is used to that. However, Garland will undermine both investigations by continuing to block the appointment of a special counsel into Biden and his family.The Biden discovery will complicate the narrative for many in Washington, particularly those who previously took the position that knowing possession alone justifies a criminal charge. When added to theHillary Clintondestruction of tens of thousands of emails and use of unsecure private servers, Garland may be creating the greatest credibility crisis for the Justice Department in decades. It is due to his framing of these investigations.It is all part of theincredible shrinking Merrick Garland. At a time that leadership is demand, Garland is again evading his most difficult obligation to show total independence from his president in seeking both the full facts and full accountability in a scandal. Otherwise, he will fuel the mistrust over the treatment of the two scandals and many more, beyond the president, and future generations will likely ask \"how anyone could be that irresponsible.\"CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JONATHAN TURLEYJonathan Turley is a Fox News Media contributor and the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University. He is the author of \"The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage\" (Simon & Schuster, June 18, 2024)."
