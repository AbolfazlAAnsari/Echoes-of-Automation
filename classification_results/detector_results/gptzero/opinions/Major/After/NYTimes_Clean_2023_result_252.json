            "inputText": "Readers, including a former F.B.I. agent, respond to the novelist on guns. Also: Freedom of expression; support for Jews; the Vatican synod; climate activism.To the Editor:Re “18 More Deaths From Our Gun Addiction,” by Stephen King (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 31):Mr. King’s frustration with gun violence and his feeling of helplessness for our country are not unique, but they are born more from exhaustion than reality.I reject his view that “there is no solution to the gun problem.” We may be “addicted to firearms,” but America has overcome addiction before with the same grit and persistence that helped end slavery and bend our collective views away from racism.Cultural change takes generations. The gun culture we mistakenly fell in love with was bolstered by decades of green plastic Army men and Nerf and cap guns handed to preschoolers for play, classroom history lessons centered around military battles, and movie and television hailing the best gun handler as the hero. That was my reality, and I passed that culture to my children.“The gun problem” is just that: a problem to be solved. Just as we created that problem, we can change it. Every shooting reminds us collectively that firearms violence has become theNo. 1 killer of children and teens under the age of 19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Shooting drills are a ubiquitous part of the lives of most schoolchildren.A good coach knows when to substitute for exhausted players, and it’s OK that Mr. King and others need some bench time. Substituting in are parents afraid to send their kids to school, energized politicians, influencers, researchers and business owners looking over their shoulders for a catastrophic event. I am surrounded by them and their contagious attitudes.Mr. King may find “little more to write” right now, and that’s OK. The fresh legs off the bench are many, and they are moving with optimism, impatience and persistence to find the right courses of action that will make America’s gun violence problem no longer exist.I’m sure of that.Katherine SchweitCentreville, Va.The writer, a retired F.B.I. agent, created and ran the F.B.I.’s active shooter program, set up after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. She is the author of “Stop the Killing: How to End the Mass Shooting Crisis” and “How to Talk About Guns With Anyone.”To the Editor:I agree with Stephen King. There is little more we can say when we cherish our guns over our children. This is the nonfiction horror story of our times, told repeatedly with the same ending.Pam LeiterSouth Haven, Mich.Standing Up for Freedom of ExpressionTo the Editor:Re “Magazine Editor Fired After Letter on Israel” (news article, Oct. 28):We are treading on thin ice when the editor of a major arts publication is fired by the publishers because an open letter posted by the editor and staff on the Israel-Hamas war “failed to meet the organization’s standards.”This is only a thinly veiled excuse covering up their fear that advertisers will pull out. We have already seen major donors to universities stopping their support for similar reasons.Democracy is already under threat here in the U.S. The war in the Middle East is only further exacerbating these divisions. Rather than retrenching, the arts community must stand up for freedom of expression, which is at the core of its foundation.We have difficult days ahead, and it is not time to cave in to regressive forces who are wielding the power of the checkbook at the expense of those wielding the power of the pen, paintbrush or camera.Glenn RugaConcord, Mass.The writer is executive editor of ZEKE magazine.A Rabbi in Pittsburgh Sees SupportTo the Editor:Re “At Synagogue, Recovery Is Mixed With Renewed Grief” (news article, Oct. 28):The “deafening” silence of non-Jewish colleagues noted by a fellow rabbi in Pittsburgh has not echoed my own experience in the aftermath of the brutal attacks of Hamas on Jews in Israel.Pittsburgh loves its Jews. Since Oct. 7, I have received many calls and emails of support from non-Jewish friends and colleagues. And the many non-Jews I work with in the health care system remembered the fifth anniversary of the Oct. 27 Tree of Life synagogue shooting and expressed their sympathies.I still feel overwhelmed by the compassion of others and continue to believe that the good people in this world outnumber the evil people. Bishop David Zubik of Pittsburgh organizedan interfaith servicehere recently.I acknowledge that in recent weeks agitators have been busy trying to bring youths especially to their side and make ad hominem attacks on Israelis and the Jews, particularly on campuses and atour public high school in Squirrel Hill.However, my non-Jewish friends and colleagues continue to affirm my role serving the Jewish community, the value of the Jewish state and the right of Israel to defend itself as a sovereign homeland for the Jewish people.Jonathan PerlmanPittsburghThe writer is the rabbi of New Light Congregation.The Vatican SynodTo the Editor:Re “Sensitive Issues Are Put Off as Vatican Synod Concludes” (news article, Oct. 29):It seems that a majority of the delegates to the recent Vatican synod agree that the position of women in the church needs careful consideration, but are not yet convinced that the same is true in the case of L.G.B.T.Q.+ Catholics, which is a pity.This is particularly true since the real triumph of the synod may prove to be in its membership, voting and not, which included lay people and women for the first time.But it is increasingly apparent that, like the House of Representatives, the most conservative voices sang most effectively, and seem to have prevented the more open dialogue for which so many of us were hoping. But the synod will reconvene next October, when it may be possible to hope for a more inclusive ending.John C. HirshWashingtonThe writer teaches medieval literature at Georgetown University.Eco-Anxiety and Eco-ActivismTo the Editor:In “This Is What Keeps My Eco-Anxiety in Check” (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Oct. 24), Ron Currie writes that “instead of blowing up a plastics factory, I go and gather garbage by myself most days.”There has to be a middle ground between picking up garbage on a beach and blowing up a plastics factory! I get that it is mind-cleansing to leave a space cleaner than when you found it, and celebrate Mr. Currie’s creative contribution to consciousness-raising.But Mr. Currie could also be writing op-eds that help educate the public about major banks’ fossil fuel investments or the deforestation supported by asset managers. With fellow writers, he might help organize professional groups to vote for a resolution that condemns companies for investing in fossil fuels.As someone active in the climate struggle, I know that we must proceed on multiple levels. I can appreciate someone’s not being a mass movement person, but the public has to begin to understand that individual acts, including recycling and buying electric cars, will not lower carbon emissions in time to save our plant, animal and human species.And given the stakes, maybe a little climate anxiety is not so terrible.Virginia CasperWest Shokan, N.Y.The writer is on the coordinating committees of TIAA-Divest! and 1000 Grandmothers for Future Generations.This article appeared in print on page A25."
