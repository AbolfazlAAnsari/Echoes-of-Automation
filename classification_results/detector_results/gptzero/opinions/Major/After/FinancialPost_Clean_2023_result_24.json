We don't think so.In large part, the argument in favour of following the Fed has to do with the Canada-U.S. exchange rate, which has mainly depreciated since the tightening cycle began a year ago, and which matters for an inflation-targeting central bank like the Bank of Canada.Some depreciations aren't a problem. Suppose the Canadian dollar falls relative to the U.S. dollar because demand falls for Canadian goods. If that happens, foreigners require fewer Canadian dollars and our dollar depreciates - just as it would appreciate if the demand for Canadian goods rose. In such cases, the exchange rate acts as a shock absorber: a depreciation makes Canadian goods cheaper, causing a rebound in foreign demand. An appreciation does the opposite. Either way, monetary policy doesn't have to, and probably shouldn't, react.But suppose the Canadian dollar falls relative to the U.S. dollar because investor preferences change - as, for example, when nervousness causes a flight to the U.S. dollar. That kind of depreciation will make Canadian exports cheaper for foreign buyers and imports more expensive for Canadians. That increases inflation here at home, and, as a result the bank may need to respond with tighter monetary policy.In our view, even if the recent decline in the Canada-U.S. exchange rate is mainly due to global rebalancing toward the U.S. dollar - the so-called \"safe haven effect\" - and bumps inflation up a little, monetary conditions in Canada are still quite restrictive, which means the bank needn't mimic further hikes by the Fed.Real policy interest rates - calculated by subtracting inflation from nominal rates - are rising in Canada, and at a faster pace than in the U.S. And they're what matter(https://www.cdhowe.org/intelligence-memos/ambler-kronick-monetary-policy-looser-now-it-was-february) for monetary policy effectiveness.The bank is targeting 4.5 per cent, while the range the Fed is aiming for is 4.5 to 4.75 per cent.

Real rates are still negative in both countries but less negative here. Those inflation numbers are year-over-year, however, which is mostly old information. Looking at one-month or three-month annualized rates of inflation, real interest rates are now moving into positive territory. And, because inflation is continuing to fall, the bank's real policy rate will continue to rise even without further rate hikes. In effect, monetary policy will continue to tighten in Canada.Our other main reason for believing the bank should not follow the Fed in lock step is that the Canadian economy is showing more signs of weakness than the American. Real growth in Canada was stagnant in the fourth quarter, compared to an annualized growth rate of 2.7 per cent in the U.S. In part, this reflects the fact that the bank began tightening before the Fed did.
