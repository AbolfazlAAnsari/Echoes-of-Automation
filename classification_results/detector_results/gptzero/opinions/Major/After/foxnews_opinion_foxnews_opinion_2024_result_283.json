This would be like saying a batter who has struck out four times in a row is more likely to hit a home run than a batter who has hit three homers in his last four at bats.By the way,Biden did NOT inherit inflationfrom Trump. In his last four months in office the inflation rate wasOct. 20 – 1.2%Nov. 20 – 1.3%Dec. 20 – 1.5%Jan. 21 – 1.4%Then, 18 months later, under Biden, it was 9.1%.TRUMP ECONOMIC ADVISER PUSHES BACK ON BIDEN'S NEWS CONFERENCE CLAIMSNow let’s look at interest rates. The mortgage interest rate was 2.9% when Trump left office. The mortgage interest rate is now roughly 7%. That’s more than twice as high.Thehigher interest rates and the inflationin rents and housing prices mean that the mortgage payment on a median value home is now TWICE as high under Biden as under Trump.How about the interest rate on federal borrowing? During Trump’s last year in office, the 10-year Treasury bill was 0.9%. After three and a half years of Biden, the interest rate is at 4.3%.Finally, there is the issue of the federal deficits and debt. Neither president has a good record on controlling spending and borrowing. That’s because both parties like to spend money and play Santa Claus. The question is which president had a worse record?ALL THE REASONS WHY TRUMP'S TAX-FREE TIPS PLAN IS BRILLIANTWhen we take out the two COVID years, 2020 and 2021, we find that the average deficits under Trump were roughly $750 billion. That’s bad. But under Biden, the average deficit was $1.5 trillion. Even adjusting for Bidenflation, deficits have been at least 50% higher under Biden than Trump.But let’s put aside the real worldrecord of Trump and Bidenand look at their policy proposals. Trump wants to make the tax rate reductions permanent, continue to deregulate the economy, and encourage greater production of U.S. energy.All of these policies are DISinflationary. They will  make America more competitive in the world economy, bring capital to the United States, keep the dollar strong, and increase the production of goods and services.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONBiden wants to raise tax rateson American businesses, increase regulations, and continue to waste hundreds of billions of dollars on low-return green energy programs while curtailing U.S. production of oil, gas and coal.Only a Ph.D. in economics who teaches at an Ivy League school would believe that these Biden policies will bring inflation and interest rates DOWN. They need to take a history class.When Jimmy Carter endorsed high tax rates, more regulation, and green energy policies, the inflation rate went to above 10%. When Reagan came into office and cut tax rates, deregulated, and went all in for American energy, the inflation rate fell by half.Biden also points to the16 Nobel Prize-winning economistswho say he will be better on taming inflation than Trump. These are the very same economists who assured us when Biden proposed trillions of dollars of new spending that these policies would NOT cause inflation.Maybe these economists should simply send back their Ph.D.s and their Nobel medals and admit that they have no idea what they are talking about.Stephen Moore is a founder of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM STEPHEN MOORE"
