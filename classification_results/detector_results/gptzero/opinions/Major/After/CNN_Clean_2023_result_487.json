Meanwhile, just like in Panem, the political leaders managing this conflict sit safely in their offices, making decisions that keep the war going for another generation.By contrast, another driving force for \"Parallel Lines,\" was Anthony Doerr's Pulitzer Prize-winning historical novel, \"All the Light We Cannot See.\" It's an enchanting and heartbreaking tale of two young people also caught in the midst of an adult war - this time World War II.The story centers on Marie-Laure Leblanc, a blind French girl who escapes Paris to the seaside town ofSaint-Malo, and Werner Pfennig, a German boy, who must serve the Nazis as a radio technician. As the two struggle to survive the all-encompassing turmoil and pain of conflict, their stories are told in parallel - until their paths ultimately cross.In \"Parallel Lines,\" which I decided to dedicate \"To all young people growing up in adult conflicts,\" I, too, present the conflict from all sides, diving into the minds of three young women from each of Jerusalem's distinct tribes: Tamar, a secular Jewish Israeli, Nour, a Palestinian Muslim and Rivki, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish Israeli.In contrast to journalism, where we face limitations on word count or the need to include essential context, background and, of course, responses, literary fiction allows for a more nuanced and broader portrayal of a situation. And telling this complicated story in an unfiltered and more direct way gives greater power to challenge one-sided beliefs, spark critical thinking and, hopefully, inspire action.By getting inside the heads of my characters, who are based on real-life people, and sharing their experiences, I was able to show what they see and feel as the conflict continues to explode around them. And the best part of putting out a novel like this is that readers have no choice but to listen to the narrative of the other side, whether they agree with it or not.While some might argue that fiction is a way of avoiding the truth of difficult or sensitive subjects, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I would say the opposite is true. An excellent example of this is Richard Powers' \"The Overstory,\" which also won a Pulitzer. His book takes on the increasingly polarizing debate around the climate crisis. Through multiple and identifiable characters, Powers explores the dangers of damage to our environment and the power of nature, reframing the issue to make it more accessible.Literature, unlike the fast-paced, ever-changing news cycle - or even the dusty pages of a nonfiction book - can grab a reader's attention and pull on people's heartstrings on issues that might be difficult to truly understand or that are deeply divisive. And, in an era of political entrenchment, where societies everywhere are more polarized than ever, these fictional tellings of well-worn stories (or never-ending conflicts) are ever more critical. \"Parallel Lines\" is exactly that - a retelling and a reframing of an age-old conflict, aimed at those who are seeking a better understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as at those who think they know the reality of life here but really don't.Opinion by Ruth Marks EglashTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
