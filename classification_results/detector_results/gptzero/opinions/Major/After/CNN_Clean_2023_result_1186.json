American troops have already beentargeted by dozens of drone and missile attacksfrom Iranian-backed forces in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and haveconducted retaliatory strikesin response. In Eastern Europe, the US is essentially engaged in aproxy warwith Russia over the latter's invasion of Ukraine. In East Asia, the US risks acatastrophic showdownwith China over the political status of Taiwan.During hisOval Office addresslast month, President Joe Biden argued that all these flashpoints are interconnected fronts in what the administration has previously framed as a global struggle betweendemocracy and autocracy. Biden referenced former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's quote that America is \"the indispensable nation,\" adding that \"American leadership is what holds the world together.\" Biden further asserted that \"making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for America's national security.\" In aWashington Post op-edthis weekend, he reiterated that the US is \"the essential nation.\"These claims do not stand up to scrutiny. America's entanglement in these crises is only further overstretching its capabilities, courting unnecessary risks, inflaming local enmities and depriving the American people of resources better used at home. Indeed, the American people are increasingly reluctant to foot the bill indefinitely for military aid to conflicts abroad, with recent polls showing declining support among both Democrats and Republicans for bothIsraelandUkraine.The decades-long US policy of maintaining permanent friends and enemies in the Middle East has been counterproductive to its stated interest inregional stability. The US in recent yearsantagonized Iranby imposing a \"maximum pressure\" campaign of economic sanctions while assassinating key Iranian military figure,Qasem Soleimani. Meanwhile, the US has inadvertently boosted Tehran's regional influence by overthrowing Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq and later by contributing arms to anti-Assad forces during the Syrian Civil War, which ultimatelyempoweredIran-backed militias in the fight against both ISIS and US-supported Sunni rebels.Nor has regional stability been advanced by the United States' partners, whose bad behavior has been enabled by unconditioned support from Washington. The US hasconsistently backed Israeldespite its continued settlement-building in the occupied West Bank and long-standing blockade of Gaza, feeding the underlying Israeli-Palestinian conflict that now threatens to engulf the region.And despite its \"democracy versus autocracy\" rhetoric, the US supported Saudi Arabia'sgruesome waragainst Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, which produced what the United Nationscalled\"the worst humanitarian crisis in the world,\" with some377,000 people killedandapproximately 80% of the countryin need of humanitarian aid. The Biden administration has sincedoubled downon its security relationship with the Saudis.Contrary to the goal of avoiding a broader conflict in the Middle East or Ukraine, the president's Oval Office address last month instead sought to frame these crises in global terms. Biden claimed that if the US does not thwart distant adversaries, they and others will be emboldened to pursue further aggression, and American alliances will be undermined. This reasoning is based ondubious assumptionsdrawn fromWWII and the Cold War, respectively known as the \"Munich analogy\" and the \"domino theory.\"Bidenclaimedthat if Russia is not stopped in Ukraine, Putin will march on to Poland or the Baltic states. This is not plausible. Russia does not have the material capability to try to conquer Eastern Europe, even if it wanted to. Even without the US and Canada, European NATO members in 2022 spent vastly more on defense and retained many moreactive duty personnelthan Russia, had acombined GDPnearly nine times larger, apopulation3.5 times larger and their own nuclear deterrent. Russia's poor performance in Ukraine makes this fear even more remote.The president alsomade a veiled suggestionthat if Russia is not decisively defeated in Ukraine, China would be emboldened to invade Taiwan. This assumption is similarly unfounded. As political scientists like Daryl Press and Jonathan Mercer have argued, states tend to predict an adversary's future behavior based oncurrent capabilities and perceived interestsrather thanpast behavior in a separate context. If China invaded Taiwan, it would most likely be because Beijing has a greater stake in Taiwan than Washington does, possesses a military advantage a hundred miles off its coast and believes it has no path to peaceful reunification - not because the US wavered in its support for Ukraine.Meanwhile, there is no sign America's treaty allies are losing faith in the credibility of its commitment to their defense. Low defense spending on the part of capable states likeJapan and Germanyindicates America's allies remain all too confident they can continue passing the buck to Uncle Sam. Were the US to do less for their defense, Japan and Germany would almost certainly do more out of their imperative for self-preservation - not simply surrender their sovereignty to China or Russia.The US should adopt a morerestrained grand strategy, one that would more rigorously set priorities among foreign interests, entail fewer risks of entanglement, be less prone to provoke distant rivals and be more aligned with America's domestic resources and needs.First, the US should not maintain eternal allies and enemies. As former President Richard Nixononce said, \"Our interests must shape our commitments, rather than the other way around.\" Military alliances are commitments to wage war on another's behalf if necessary. America should therefore enter alliances to counterbalance specific threats when they emerge; as threats change, so should alliances. Alliances involve significantcosts and risksand must therefore be guided by truly vital security interests, not pretensions of global leadership.Second, the US should stop uniting its adversaries. By framing international politics as a fight between democracy and autocracy, the US is merely ensuring that it has lots of enemies arrayed against it. The growing security alignment betweenChina, Russia and Iranis largely based on acommon threatfrom the United States, rather than an attempt to export a given regime type (which they don't share). The US itself has by farthe most extensive recordof trying to impose its own values on others by force. Prudent rapprochements with former adversaries should be made when there are no vital interests in dispute.Third, the United States should shift the burden of managing regional threats over to its regional partners, especially in the Middle East and Europe.Ammunition shortagesresulting from the wars in Ukraine and Gaza are only one demonstration that America's resources are finite.Scaling back America's overextended military presence would incentivize capable regional states with an interest in self-preservation to pool forces to counterbalance local threats. Burden-shifting to regional partners would also mitigate the risk of the US getting pulled into a major war and reduce the substantial costs of maintaining forces overseas. The United States' favorable power position and distance from Eurasia allows it to pass the buck to others while remaining secure.Finally, if the US wants to advance democratic values around the world, it should do so by providing a compelling model of successful democracy at home that's worthy of being emulated abroad. Bidendeclaresthat \"America is a beacon to the world.\" Yet as America attempts to prop up its empire, its republic is hurting.
