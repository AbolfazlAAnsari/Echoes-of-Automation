            "inputText": "By Ysabella Elisheva Hazan and Rick AiyerIsrael, still reeling from the Oct. 7 massacre, is being wrongfully accused of perpetuating a genocide in Gaza. It bears recalling that the origin of the word \"genocide,\" being coined(https://www.ushmm.org/genocide-prevention/learn-about-genocide-and-other-mass-atrocities/what-is-genocide) by lawyer and Holocaust survivor Raph√§el Lemkin in an effort to describe the Nazi policy of systematically murdering Jews, did not exist before 1944. It was Lemkin who led the campaign to recognize genocide as a crime under international law, culminating in the adoption of the Genocide Convention in 1948, the same year the state of Israel was re-birthed from the ashes of the Holocaust. More intimately than any other nation on Earth, the people of Israel understand what constitutes a genocide.Much can be said about South Africa's filing, but the pressing question is whether the International Court of Justice (ICJ) will accede to South Africa's request for provisional measures. If the court follows its own precedent in the 1999 Yugoslavia Orders(https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/105/105-19990602-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf), the answer is clear: South Africa's request must be rejected.BackgroundAmong its demands, South Africa seeks an order compelling Israel to \"immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza\" - simultaneously instructing the court to ignore the plight of the approximately 130 hostages that remain in Gaza (among them women and children, including Kfir Bibas(https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel-at-war/1703069000-the-last-2-israeli-kids-in-gaza-the-bibas-family-awaits-the-return-of-kfir-and-ariel), who marked his first birthday in captivity).The ICJ is no stranger to cases brought under the Genocide Convention. In Ukraine v Russian Federation(https://www.icj-cij.org/case/182/orders) (2022), the court demonstrated its willingness to order the immediate suspension of military operations as a provisional measure.Clearly, there is no equivalence between Russia's full-scale offensive invasion of Ukraine and Israel's defensive war in Gaza in response to Hamas's systematic slaughter of more than 1,200 civilians on Oct. 7. Even South Africa does not deny that Hamas carried out the full range of atrocity crimes under international law - including rape, torture and hostage-taking. Shamefully (and perhaps conveniently), South Africa has chosen to ignore Hamas's explicitly genocidal aims, the loud and proud genocidal rhetoric of its leadership and founding documents, as well as the atrocities committed in the name of that genocidal ideology on the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. Equally absent in South Africa's submission is reference to the fact that Hamas has vowed(https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-official-says-group-aims-to-repeat-oct-7-onslaught-many-times-to-destroy-israel/ ) to repeat Oct. 7 \"again and again.\"The Yugoslavia precedentIn the 1990s, Yugoslavia unsuccessfully tested the same strategy attempted by South Africa today. In response to the humanitarian catastrophe then unfolding in Kosovo, NATO launched Operation Allied Force. Yugoslavia responded by taking a number of NATO countries to the ICJ on the basis of the Genocide Convention. As a provisional measure, it sought an order compelling the countries to \"cease immediately the acts of use of force.\"In rejecting(https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/105/105-19990602-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf) Yugoslavia's request, the court emphasized what it would do well to remember today: genocide, by definition, cannot exist without \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\" As the UN Office on Genocide Prevention observes(https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide.shtml#:~:text=It%20is%20this%20special%20intent,does%20not%20include%20that%20element. ), it is this special intent, or dolus specialis, that makes genocide - the \"crime of all crimes\" - so unique. The ICJ found that NATO's bombings \"(did) not appear (to) entail the element of intent, towards a group as such.\"In this respect, the Yugoslavia Orders are critically important because they clarify - as a matter of ICJ precedent - what should be obvious: wars, even costly and bloody wars, cannot be casually labelled genocide. The court was explicit on this point, observing that \"the threat or use of force against a state cannot in itself constitute an act of genocide.\"In its 84-page(https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192) application, South Africa, relying on such metrics as the scale of military operations, attempts to argue that Israel - a democratic state committed to the rule of law - has demonstrated the special intent that is the \"essential characteristic\" of genocide. However, while South Africa's submissions might impress in length, they entirely fail in substance.The Yugoslavia precedent is instructive in clarifying that wars are not synonymous with genocide. While the allegations levelled against NATO before the ICJ are strikingly similar to those now made against Israel, the ICJ has even stronger grounds to reject South Africa's application given that the defensive war Israel is fighting is in densely populated urban areas against a terrorist group that strategically hides behind civilians while preventing them from exiting conflict zones.Michael Higgins: The 'genocide' case against Israel is a contemptible farce(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/michael-higgins-the-genocide-case-against-israel-a-contemptible-farce)Irwin Cotler: South Africa is inverting reality by accusing Israel of genocide(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/south-africa-is-inverting-reality-by-accusing-israel-of-genocide)In seeking provisional measures, Yugoslavia argued that NATO bombings had resulted in thousands of civilians being killed or seriously injured; that the lives of three million children were endangered; and that one million citizens were short of water supply. Yugoslavia listed an array of targets allegedly attacked in the airstrikes, including hospitals, schools, and cultural-historical and religious monuments. Still, the ICJ refused to conflate war and genocide. A fortiori, it must reach the same conclusion with South Africa's request today.It is abundantly clear that Israel's war is against Hamas not Gaza - and the IDF does not intentionally target civilians, as demonstrated by Israel's leaflets in Arabic, phone calls and humanitarian corridors that are intended to keep Gazans safe. The essential takeaway: while Israel strives to minimize civilian casualties and facilitate the entry of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, Hamas uses children as human shields, diverts and steals aid intended for civilians, and indiscriminately fires rockets that land within Gaza, thereby causing untold death and suffering. Even International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan acknowledged(https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-icc-prosecutor-karim-khan-kc-cairo-situation-state-palestine-and-israel), \"Israel has a professional and well-trained military,\" with \"a system that is intended to ensure their compliance with international humanitarian law.\"As ICJ Judge Mohamed Bennouna lamented(https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/182/182-20220316-ord-01-02-en.pdf), the \"concept of genocide has been overused and indiscriminately employed by propagandists of all persuasions.\" Time will prove South Africa's claim to be the embodiment of this regrettable trend, which, in Bennouna's words, \"is neither in the interest of the human groups under serious threat of destruction, nor in the interest of the credibility and efficiency of the (Genocide) Convention.\"The ICJ must safeguard Israel's right under international law to rescue its hostages and protect the security of its citizens from attacks. Its credibility as a judicial institution hinges on it.Special to National PostYsabella Elisheva Hazan holds two law degrees from the University of Ottawa and is the founder of Jewish empowerment movement, Decolonized Judean.Rick Aiyer is a Master of Law student at the University of Cambridge.
