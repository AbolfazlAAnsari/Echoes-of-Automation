feature of elite sensibility, but any politician who threatens Biden’s re-election will get the same treatment. Robert Kennedy, Jr., who is making a third-party bid, has been called \"vile\" and \"racist.\"The No Labels group, which is considering fielding a candidate, has been accused of \"brain-breaking logic\" that promotes \"less democracy.\"Nikki Haley has so far been spared because she is thought to weaken Trump.The moment she endangers Biden, we can be sure that The New York Times will reveal her participation in a sex trafficking ring or possibly ritual cannibalism.Nobody is so insignificant as to avoid the tentacles of the conglomerate.Only in this sense is Our Democracy truly democratic: all of us, high and low, are given our marching orders, which we defy at our peril.Parents of schoolchildren who dissented from the identity creed have been treated like domestic terrorists.Participants at the pro-Trump Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol building were prosecuted as subversives and punished with long prison sentences.Other critics have been subjected to harassment from federal agencies like the IRS and the FBI.A convoluted censorship apparatus was erected at the start of the pandemic, eventually giving the White House control over what was allowed to be said on all the major digital platforms.President Biden appears in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 28. Biden took credit for declining crime rates in parts of the U.S. as he seeks to reverse potentially damaging public perceptions that violence and lawlessness are on the rise.(Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Bloomberg via Getty Images)The FBI, faithful servant of the system, stood guard over forbidden speech: unorthodox opinions about the virus at first, but soon, inevitably, the ban spread to topics that favored Trump and the Republicans, identity heresy, Ukraine war criticism, mockery of the Biden administration — pretty much everything the First Amendment was enacted to protect.Censorship bureaucrats devised a bizarre jargon of control: \"misinformation\" meant error, \"disinformation\" meant deliberate falsehood, and \"malinformation\" was truth Our Democracy found unacceptable.Without warrant or warning, millions of posts by ordinary Americans were taken down.Some of those posters were permanently silenced.Trumpist websites were arbitrarily \"deplatformed.\"Nothing like it had been seen in our country since John Adams rubbed his hands with glee over the Alien and Sedition Acts.One might have expected members of the entity formerly known as \"the press\" to investigate the abuses and raise the alarm.That idea is too retro for words, literally.Today, the great organs of the news media are happy to serve as attack dogs of the elite class and obedient apologists of institutional power.Our Democracy aims to dominate the information sphere — as things now stand, it can speak loudly to everyone, while its opponents, shoved into an informational ghetto, speak mostly to themselves.This is the array of forces standing behind the doddering, stupefied figure of Joe Biden, eager to foist him on American voters.Our Democracy is the true candidate and ultimate question to be settled by the 2024 election.It is battling mightily, with every weapon available, to destroy Trump and other obstacles to its continued rule.Sooner or later, I imagine, it will succeed.The wisdom of Ecclesiastes tells us that the fight does not go to the strong — but a political analyst would be crazy to bet any other way.Is it possible to identify a glimmer of optimism somewhere in this bleak landscape?I can think of two strategic vulnerabilities that should trouble Our Democracy.One is the massive unpopularity of its policy positions.Large majorities of Americans of all races and political leanings question the sanity of open borders, for example, and believe that merit rather than grievance should determine outcomes.If the 2024 election is fought on the merits of the case, the Democrats lose big.The second vulnerability is Biden’s obvious and extraordinary unfitness to stay on as president.The report by Special Counsel Robert Hur, which characterized the president as \"an elderly man with poor memory,\" was official confirmation of what we can plainly see with our own eyes.Old age is terminal: there’s no fixing Biden, and there’s no clear way out of thismess for the Democrats.If he clings to power, he will continue to decline physically and politically, opening the door to a Republican victory in 2024 — in the person, it may be, of the dreaded Trump.If Biden turns down a second term at this late hour, his vice president, Kamala Harris, would be the natural heir to the party leadership, but she’s even more unpopular than he is.With Harris as candidate, defeat would be virtually certain.If a free-for-all erupts over the top spot, either because Biden has offered to abdicate or because the paladins of Our Democracy wish to shove him aside, the internal trauma to the Democratic Party would probably prove fatal, regardless of who the winner might be.The Democratic establishment is solid but brittle.Once it crumbles, the agents of chaos will be in command, as they have been for some time in the Republican Party.To my mind, these are low-probability events, as the elites realize how much they stand to lose and will huddle in a conformist herd for protection.Fortunately, however, history is not a mathematical proposition — and one can always hope.Martin Gurri is author of \"The Revolt of the Public,\" a former CIA analyst, and presently a visiting fellow at the Mercatus Center of George Mason University.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
