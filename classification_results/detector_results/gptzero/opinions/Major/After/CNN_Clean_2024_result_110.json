Charles is receiving outpatient treatment in London, and is expected to continue the paperwork duties of his office and his weekly meeting with the British Prime Minister, while suspending public-facing events.It's not particularly fashionable to evince any empathy for an ultra-wealthy family that lives in luxury in large part on the public dime, deemed special by birthright and not because of any actual aptitude or achievement. I find the royal family to be an anachronism. But its family members they are also human beings, and spectacularly influential ones at that.Charles' diagnosis, on a basic human level, should merit all of our sympathy - which, after all, is an unlimited resource.It could also be a moment for this fractured family to reckon with some of its internal misdeeds, and perhaps come back together. The most obvious fissure is that initiated by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.The details of that break remain contested, but inHarry and Meghan's telling, part of the reason for it was the royal family's failure to fully protect Meghan from an aggressive, harassing and often racist British tabloid press, a particularly sensitive issue for Harry, whose mother was killed after a car she was in,driven by a drunk man, sped away from paparazzi.Another aspect, the couple said, was the royal family'sracism,including, as Meghan told Oprah, \"concerns and conversations about how dark (their son's) skin might be when he's born.\" She also felt \"silenced\" by the family, andsaidshe \"came to understand that not only was (she) not being protected, but that they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family.\" Harry said he believes thestress of the press attackson Meghan caused her to miscarry.

Harry, it seems, is doing his filial duty and rushing to his father's side in a time of need. This is undoubtedly a difficult time for Charles, as he confronts a serious illness, but if he can muster the energy, this would be a prime opportunity for him to do his paternal duty, face the many ways he may have failed his youngest son, apologize and perhaps to begin making amends to Harry and his family.

By many accounts, the royal family has been profoundly dysfunctional for generations. And this cannot be undone in a day, or even with a single emergency or tragedy.But every reconciliation has to begin somewhere, often with a single act of contrition and an attempt at repair. If this diagnosis has Charles contemplating his life and his legacy, it would be an apt moment for him to be honest with himself and his sons about a near-universal reality of parenthood: that he has had his own struggles, that he has some regrets about the choices he made as a father, and that he loves his boys tremendously and wants to walk forward on a better path.Harry may not be wholly receptive - family estrangements like the one Harry and Meghan have chosen are often both exceptionally painful and deeply thought-through last resorts. But in flying to London, Harry seems to be making a noble effort to support his father in a difficult time. His father, I hope, will rise to the moment, and do the hard work of fighting cancer while also fighting for his son.Opinion by Jill FilipovicTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
