I’ve fought hard against Biden administration regulation, voting to block the Waters of the United States rule, which was EPA’s power grab over Missouri's family farms and ranches.During my tenure as attorney general, I also pursued legal action against the Biden administration multiple times to protect Missourians, including challenging a climate change executive order that posed risks to agriculture and energy production essential to Missouri's economy.In short, the government told small business owners — without any basis in law — that they had to accommodate a so-called expert or lose their livelihoods.In ruling in favor of the fishermen, the Supreme Court has delivered a once-in-a-generation opportunity to help these Missourians and all Americans by restoring the separation of powers and curbing an out-of-control regulatory state disproportionately harming working families.However, the battle is not yet won. With the Supreme Court rightfully returning authority back to the legislative branch,Congress must not punt this backto the regulatory agencies. It's the duty of our elected leaders in the House and Senate to take on the burden of legislating, just as it was before.Under the Constitution, lawmaking authority rests with Congress, not the administrative state. If those laws inflict harm, the Constitution affords Americans the means to voice their grievances. Forty years ago, the Supreme Court’s Chevron decision upset that balance.Today, the balance has been restored, and more importantly, the government’s accountability to the people has been restored. It is now up to Congress to see this judicial victory through.Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and is a member of the Cybersecurity, Emerging Threats and Capabilities, and Seapower Subcommittee. He is also an active member of the Joint Economic Committee."
