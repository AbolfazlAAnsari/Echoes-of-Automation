Russia, he said, will soon concentrate military units near the northern part of the countries' shared frontier.Just weeks earlier, Finland closed its border crossings with Russia, accusing Moscow of launching a \"hybrid operation\" - weaponizing desperate migrants by helping them reach the frigid European border in the Arctic in an effort to destabilize the European Union.In an interview with state media, Putin claimed that the two countries had no problems before Finland joined NATO, having resolved their territorial disputes in the 20th century. ButFinland remembershow they were \"resolved\" - with a Russian invasion and a ferocious 1939-1940Winter Warthat left Russia in possession of parts of Finland.When Russia invaded Ukraine last year, Finland decided neutrality did not guarantee safety. It needed the protection of joining NATO.Tensions along the Arctic have grown exponentially since Russia's unprovoked 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but the troubles were growing long before.For decades, the region at the top of the globe seemed like a special place, where world powers could come together for the common good.The Arctic Councillooked like a model of coexistence: A forum created in 1996, during that brief interlude of optimism in relations between post-SovietRussia and the West.The group, made up of the eight countries with territory inside the Arctic and indigenous peoples - Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, the US - sought to promote peace, stability, and sustainable developments, safeguarding the region.By the turn of the century, however, relations with Russia - and later with China, whose role in the region is now emerging - took a negative turn.In retrospect, some observers argue thatRussia exploited that perceptionof Arctic \"exceptionalism\" the mantra of \"High North, low tension,\" publicly proclaiming its commitment to peaceful cooperation, while simultaneously launching a gargantuan military buildup.In October 2021, Russia took over the rotating chairmanship of the Council. Speaking to the annual Arctic Circle Assembly in Reykjavik, Iceland, Nicolay Korchunov, a top Russian Arctic official, outlined Moscow's plans. During Russia's chairmanship,he explained, \"we will continue to foster constructive cooperation, maintain peace and stability...\"A few months later, Russia invaded Ukraine. The work of the Arctic Council froze.Its very futurewas put in doubt.Soon after, Russia accelerated its military and commercial activities in the region.In brazen disregard for environmental safety standards, Russia started usingthin-hulled- rather than ice-class oil tankers - to transport crude across the region. One shudders to imagine what a major oil spill would do to this unspoiled top of the world.During a summit between Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in March, the two countries agreed tofocus on the Arctic, appearing to open a new front against the West. By some estimates, China has invested$90 billionin the region.Moscow and Beijing are working together to build a \"Polar Silk Road,\" with economic, geopolitical, and military objectives. China is unsubtly crafting an argument to become a player in the region, declaring itself a\"near-Arctic state.\"NATO finds it all concerning, according toAdmiral Bauer, \"because while Russia's intentions in the Arctic have become clear in recent years,\" China's \"remain opaque.\"Moscow meanwhile has decried NATO's eastward expansion. And now, the accession of Finland, and possibly Sweden into the alliance, would leave Russia as the only Arctic nation outside of NATO.If, as some argue, Russia managed to pull the wool over the eyes of its Arctic neighbors, its invasion of Ukraine ripped it off. \"It might be hard to understand how deep the peace has been in Norway,\" said Norway's Deputy Defense Minister Anne Marie Aanerud. \"We literally felt nothing could go wrong for generations.\"Now Norway's Arctic is not just the place to watch pods of whales go foraging for herring among soaring icebound fjords. NATO's military forces also make frequent visits, responding to provocative maneuvers by Russia's massive military presence.In September, Tromso residents saw aFrench Navy's submarineemerge from its waters. Days later, aUS submarinewas also greeted here.Aanerud recalled a Russian military exercise a few months ago, which appeared to practice cutting off the Scandinavian peninsula.In response, Scandinavia will soon host the enormous \"Nordic Response\" military exercise, with participation of some 20,000 troops from 14 countries.The Arctic - the extreme northern latitude - with its dramatic landscapes, exotic atmospheric phenomena and still-pristine nature, may seem like a safe refuge from a tempestuous planet.But the seemingly-otherworldly oasis is very much of this world. The turbulence roiling the planet is making its way to the top of the globe, and the tensions in the High North are likely to increase even after some of today's headline-grabbing conflicts recede.Opinion by Frida GhitisTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
