By pushing Congress to fix the problems in the way Americans abroad are taxed instead of adding insult to injury with this fee, the State Department could solve this budgeting issue and the deeper tragedy of Americans being forced to cut ties with their homeland.Rebecca LammersLondonThe writer is chair of the Democrats Abroad Taxation Task Force.The Human Element in MedicineTo the Editor:Re “We Need Placebos,” by Ted J. Kaptchuk (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 11):Dr. Kaptchuk points out that placebo effects can be enhanced in the context of an attentive patient-clinician relationship. Unfortunately, the increasing use of information technology, such as online patient portals, is interfering with direct conversations between patients and their doctors.We have always known that the human dimension in the doctor-patient relationship is crucial in helping patients to feel better. Hospitals need to develop better procedures that bring back more direct interactions between patients and their doctors.If we lose the human element in medicine it will be a sad day for all of us.Stephan J.
