To them, DeSantis dropping out (and quickly endorsing Trump) wouldn't make Haley look like the safer bet, but Trump.Haley tried to make the best of DeSantis's move.\"We're not a country of coronations,\" Haley said in alate afternoon statement. \"Voters deserve a say in whether we go down the road of Trump and Biden again, or we go down a new conservative road.\"But with DeSantis's departure coming a bit over 48 hours before polls close in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, she may be hard-pressed to do better than a second-place finish behind Trump if he indeed gets 50% or more.While finishing a relatively close second would normally allow for bragging rights against a former president who is effectively a quasi-incumbent, she faces a serious calendar and geography challenge. The South Carolina primary, in Haley's home state, isn't untilFebruary 24. That gives Trump plenty of time to build on his already considerablePalmetto State Republican support, withlots of GOP elected officials, backing him and no other early states where she looks to have a shot at finishing first.Moreover, it's not just Trump's campaign that is galvanizing against her. With DeSantis out, the Republican establishment is rallying hard behind Trump. Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, who heads the Senate Republican campaign arm, made that point explicitlyin an X postlate Sunday afternoon less than two hours after DeSantis quit.\"Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee. I am encouraging every Republican to unite behind him because it will take all of us to defeat Joe Biden, take back the Senate, and hold the House,\" wrote Daines, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.This rally-around-Trump message likely makes Haley supporters even more of an isolated minority in the GOP firmament. Heading into voting Tuesday, DeSantis's withdrawal only exacerbates her challenge.Opinion by David MarkTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
