            "inputText": "By John WeekesBill C-282, a trade bill awaiting Senate approval that would prevent future Canadian trade negotiators(https://financialpost.com/tag/trade/) from ever ceding any ground on supply management(https://financialpost.com/tag/supply-management/), has three major drawbacks.First, gratuitously removing dairy(https://financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/inside-canada-national-butter-reserve), poultry and their supply-managed cousins from any talks would enrage the Americans and imperil extension of the Canada-United States-Mexico agreement, CUSMA (\"USMCA\" in the U.S.) when it comes up for renewal in 2026. Second, it would make it much harder for Canada in future trade talks to negotiate liberalization of trade in products we want to export. Negotiations always involve give-and-take. If Canada takes products off the table, so will other nations. Third, it would remove the Crown's prerogative to determine how to conduct an international negotiation.Under its terms, CUSMA automatically ends after 16 years unless its three member countries agree to extend it following a joint review, conducted by their trade ministers, on its sixth anniversary, which is July 1, 2026. If we enact Bill C-282, that will virtually guarantee the Americans will require major changes to supply management as their price for extending the deal. The U.S. has consistently tried to eliminate the trade effects of Canada's supply management programs, so far unsuccessfully. But waving the red flag of C-282 in the Americans' face in a very charged U.S. political environment would almost certainly provoke them into upping the stakes. Ironically, this gratuitous provocation would actually make defending supply management harder in any future negotiation.Other nations have also regularly taken issue with supply management. Last month, a dispute panel called by New Zealand under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement on Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) found against aspects of our programs. Talks with the U.K. on a new post-Brexit trade deal are stalled over dairy access, among other issues. The U.K. will not provide improved Canadian access for beef and pork without concessions from us on cheese - which C-282 would make impossible. Supply management has also been a problem in negotiations with Mercosur (the South American grouping that includes Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay.)Even strong supporters of supply management should think twice about making it untouchable in trade agreements. The supply-managed industries have been very successful at getting the government to support their interests in negotiations. This has been possible in part because the government has always been able to contend it can protect supply-managed producers at the same time as it seeks to negotiate export benefits for other sectors in the economy. Imagine for a moment that the Americans do decide to go for broke in a future CUSMA renegotiation and make elimination of the \"tariff rate quotas\" that protect our supply-managed sectors a requirement for extending the agreement. This would pit the supply-managed sectors against essentially all other sectors of the Canadian economy. If that were the price, there's virtually no chance the government would decide to continue to support quotas on supply-managed products.In more than 25 years as a Canadian trade negotiator I often maintained that Canadian negotiators can protect supply management at the same time as they open markets for other products. But doing so is becoming harder, particularly while negotiating market access for Canada's agricultural exports.In major multilateral negotiations, whether in the WTO or regionally, ministers often appear at the negotiating table for the final phase, ready to broker a deal. In these closed-door bargaining sessions time is limited with more than a couple of dozen ministers participating. If Canadian ministers make their priority defending supply management because they have no allies on this subject, they will short-change Canada's export interests.
