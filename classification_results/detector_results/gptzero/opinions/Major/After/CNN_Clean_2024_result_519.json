It is heartbreaking. We live in a country without sufficient safety nets to support disabled people, so it is understandable why parents chase after the hope of recovery, the hope of neurotypicality. The vaccine-autism myth encourages them to do so.Up until recently, anti-vaccination beliefs wererelatively fringe, finding an audience among certain parents of young children, wellness movements and libertarians. Then, the Covid-19 pandemic happened. The politicization of vaccines and lockdowns during the pandemic and an out-of-control misinformation industry on social media unfortunatelymainstreamedlarge planks of the anti-vaccine movement.And now, a presidential campaign, however much of a political longshot, is anchored by two people who have championed a message that threatens to expose many more vulnerable families and children not only to a chimeric mirage, but to extreme physical and emotional danger.Misinformation about vaccines has led todeclining vaccination ratesand the return of vaccine-preventable diseases, as we see now withmeasles outbreaksacross the United States.We cannot afford to think of RFK Jr.'s campaign as just a possibleelection spoiler. Kennedy and Shanahan are sowers of misinformation and the lasting damage they may have on vaccine trust should not be underestimated. As a researcher and an educator, it is my hope that enhanced public scrutiny will help reveal how this movement is based on debunked research, lies and delusions.Opinion by Catherine TanTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
