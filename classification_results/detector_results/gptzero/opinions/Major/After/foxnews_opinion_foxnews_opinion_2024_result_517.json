Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) made headlines recently with the discovery that in December 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency awarded a $50 million \"environmental justice\"grant to the Climate Justice Alliance.Capito is distressed to learn that the Climate Justice Alliance vows \"the path to climate justice travels through a free Palestine.\"BIDEN ADMIN PRIORITIZES $900 MILLION FOR GREEN SCHOOL BUSES AS ILLITERACY PLAGUES US SCHOOLSIn fact, Climate Justice Alliance serves up a full agenda of radical activities, including fighting \"political oppression\" and \"placing race, gender, and class at the center\" of its climate solutions.An angry President Joe Biden is not winning the presidential race like he wants. So he has relied on taxpayer money to get support from Democrat voters.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)But $50 million for the Climate Justice Alliance is a drop in the bucket.Had members of Congress readthe Inflation Reduction Act before passing it – a novel idea – they would know the law provides $2.8 billion to the EPA for environmental and climate justice block grants,\" (Section 60201). That's a license to hand out walking-around money to many political activists, not just the Climate Justice Alliance.Another recipient: the New York Immigration Coalition, which describes itself as a \"coalition of immigrant and refugee organizations\" pushing for more government services and political clout.Same is true of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, another recipient. The words \"climate\" and \"environment\" don't appear anywhere on these groups' websites or literature.Adding eligibility for border towns is an interesting twist. As waves of migrants overwhelm resources in these towns, Democrats are growing divided over Biden's open border policies. Money may shore up support.Lawmakers may have assumed the money was for climate improvement, but the IRA's fine print allows the moolah to be used for \"facilitating engagement of marginalized communities in Local, State and Federal public processes, such as advisory groups, workshops, rulemakings.\" Translation: elections.How easy is it to get the dough? Piece of cake. The EPA says it wants to \"alleviate much of the burden that the federal grants process places on small, resource-constrained community-based organizations supporting underserved communities and marginalized populations.\" In short, no jumping through hoops.The money can only go to a disadvantaged community or a southern border town.

These communities customarily vote Democratic.Adding eligibility for border towns is an interesting twist.

The ACA, or \"Obamacare,\" authorized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to hand out \"community transformation grants.\" Community Health Councils, a typical recipient, pledged that its mission was to advance \"social justice.\"It distributed 65% of the money to partner community groups that promoted \"voter engagement,\" conducted \"one-on-one education in the streets\" or led tenants' rights, anti-fracking and anti-drilling efforts. And you thought the ACA was about covering the uninsured.A decade after Obama, Biden is tasking every agency and department of the federal government to promote voter engagement.Biden's community grants pale in size compared to the student debt cancellation vote-buying that now totals $620 billion.
