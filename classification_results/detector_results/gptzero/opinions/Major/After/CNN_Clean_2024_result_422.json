Mangold also had Farro verify a bank record for the LLC that Cohen had created to facilitate the payments to Daniels on which Cohen affirmed that the entity wasnot associated withpolitical fundraising. Prosecutors allege the entity was formed to do the exact opposite: make a payoff to influence an election.Something that separates good lawyers from great ones is how they handle the less juicy bits of a trial. The Manhattan prosecutors trying this case havealready proventheir mettle - and I expect they will march through these documentation witnesses thoroughly but expeditiously, keeping things moving so that the jury's attention does not wander too far.Trump's lawyers are also competent, so expect them to get what they can from the witnesses. When defense counselelicitedfrom Graff on cross-examination that Trump was a good boss, she became a free character witness. And while it's true that, after her testimony concluded, Graffpolitely rebuffedTrump's attempt to shake her hand, that alone won't undermine her positive character testimony (even if it might strike jurors as odd).Sometimes the defense will stipulate - that is, simply agree with the prosecution -to much of this evidentiary work in an effort to get it over with. It's coming in to evidence anyhow if prosecutors are competent (which these certainly are). But that doesn't seem to be happening here. Trump and his counsel are the masters of delay - trying to squeeze every moment of postponement out of the process that they can. After all, the longer this case goes, the further away they can push the scheduling ofany other of the criminal trialsagainst him. Accordingly, Team Trump appears to be forcing the DA team to go step by step.So the jury may be dealing with a relatively more mundane set of topics on and off over the next few days - but they seem up for seeing it through andeven interested. And while the odds that Trump may fall asleep again remain high, he would be wiser to remain alert as prosecutors build their case piece by piece.Opinion by Norman EisenTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
