The flyover was a probe of our defenses with the side benefits (to China) of sowing dissension and redirecting our national conversation.After several earlier balloon flights failed to trigger a significant U.S. military response, the Chinese made this balloon so big and so bright that the American public could not fail to see it. It was the ultimate Big, Shiny Object. Why did they make it so visible?Three reasons: First, public awareness of the balloon forced President Biden to take military action. The Chinese learn more about their adversaries every time they provoke a military response.Second, it let the Chinese see how America responds to a low-level threat. China must have been happy to see that, instead of coming together as one nation, 9/11-style, Americans remained resolutely partisan. The president’s political opponents have used every difficult decision Mr. Biden has had to make as a way to score points against him.And finally, such a bizarre threat inevitably went viral, directing America’s national conversation away from what we had been talking about just before: the threat of Chinese expansionism and the plans to addnew U.S. military bases in the Philippines.Xi Jinping must be pleased.Paul FrantzSan FranciscoTo the Editor:This balloon, whether a weather balloon or a spy balloon, was definitely a trial balloon. The Chinese were able to assess (as was every other nation that watched) our reaction to a low-tech violation of our national airspace.We watched. We waited. Had that balloon been carrying weapons, we would have been vulnerable.Our assumption is that any attack will come via sophisticated means. Perhaps this is naïve. We have yet to learn what that balloon actually carried, but we can only speculate on what it could have carried. I shudder to think about this.Paula Markowitz WittlinMamaroneck, N.Y.Fired by Email? Employees Are Just ‘Resources.’To the Editor:“Layoffs by Email Are Cruel and Unnecessary,” by Elizabeth Spiers (Opinion guest essay, Jan. 31), exposes the results of the turning of the personnel department into the department of human resources.The personnel director became the human resources manager — a development that is now an integral part of business school curriculums.An employee is first of all a resource — to be hired or fired as the market dictates. Much like petroleum or iron ore.So why is anyone surprised that with a click of a computer key one can easily buy thousands of barrels of oil or a million tons of iron ore, and one can just as easily fire 10,000 people?Marshall De BruhlWoodfin, N.C.To the Editor:Elizabeth Spiers hits the nail on the head in summing up the increasing disparity between what employers want from their employees (24/7 sleep-in-the-office devotion) and how they treat them (like replaceable cogs to fire by email).That treatment, though, starts even earlier in the employment dance when candidates who might have gone through four or even five rounds of interviews are suddenly faced with radio silence and not even accorded the courtesy of a simple email saying they were not selected for a position.Too many times even top contenders are left to wait and wonder before finally having to send a humiliating “just checking to see where you are in the hiring process” email of their own.It takes five seconds to send a form email. That so many employers don’t routinely do this to tell candidates that they didn’t get a job speaks volumes about their true feelings about their employees, both current and potential.Laurie YarnellJupiter, Fla.A Chef Adds to the Cringe ListTo the Editor:Re “Future Cringe: Things We’ll Regret About the Present” (Thursday Styles, Feb. 2):I’d like to add these to the list of things we may find cringe-worthy in the future: impossible-to-get-into restaurants in remote, faraway locations; chefs as rock stars; shows depicting cooking as a competition; elaborate tasting menus; and tattoos as a signifier of culinary expertise.As a chef for over 40 years, I also hope we’ll move away from meal kits, takeout and delivery for food you can learn to make better and cheaper at home. And have fun doing it!David ShackNew YorkMy Doctor, via EmailTo the Editor:Re “Dollars for Their Thoughts” (Science Times, Jan. 24):I’m glad to hear that doctors are now able to bill for their email communications. That may motivate them to become more responsive.Some of my doctors are very reachable by email, but others are totally not. I have one doctor whom I can communicate with only in person, if I go to his office. Even then he severely limits how much time I can talk to him, and that’s annoying. If he could bill for every email, he might be more available.Anne BarschallTarrytown, N.Y.This article appeared in print on page A19."
