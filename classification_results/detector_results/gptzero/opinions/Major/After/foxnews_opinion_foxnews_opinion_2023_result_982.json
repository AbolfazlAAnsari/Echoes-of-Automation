Now weâve also witnessed an extension of an existing 4-day ceasefire and global attention has shifted to the plight of the hostages.On Tuesday, 12 more hostages were returned to Israel, bringing the total number of those released to 70. On October 7th, 240 hostages were kidnapped by Hamas. The hostages were from more than 40 countries. There were ten Americans in that total. Despite aggressive diplomatic efforts and direct intervention by President Biden himself, only four-year oldAbigail Edanhas been released.When Hamas was rounding up hostages on October 7 during their barbaric terror attacks, they did not discriminate when selecting their victims. The hostages are from more than 40 countries. And it did not matter if you were a grandparent as old as 85, a ten-month-old grandchild or even if you were 8-months pregnant. Nothing protects you from Hamasâ kidnappers.All of these people were intentional targets. Why?Â Because hostage-terrorism works.HAMAS TERRORISTS USE ISRAELI HOSTAGE RELEASE IN GAME OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFAREAfter serving for two years in Iraq during the height of theAl Qaeda hostage-taking crisis, coordinating the diplomatic, intelligence, military, and law enforcement response to more than 400 international kidnapping incidents, here is my definition of hostage-terrorism:Terrorist groups who use the criminal act of abducting and holding individuals against their will to announce their agenda, raise their profile, negatively influence, disrupt and degrade political will and the decision-making ability of their declared adversary.Their hostages are used for the purpose of making public demands, increasing public awareness of their cause, raising funds by extorting ransoms and or forcing concessions from nation states and other entities.Hamas is a proxy army of themullahs in Tehran, who introduced the world to the original specter of hostage-terrorism with the 444-day U.S. embassy hostage crisis in Tehran from 1979 to 1980.Â  Nightly newscasts focusing on the 66 Americans being held were a daily reminder of Americaâs inability to bring her citizenâs home; it cost Jimmy Carter his presidency.FILE â President Jimmy Carter announces new sanctions against Iran in retaliation for taking U.S. hostages, at the White House in Washington, April 7, 1980.Hostage-taking is how terrorist organizations negotiate with the West. Constant media coverage provides the oxygen fueling the speculation and highlights the non-stop attention on the hostages. While it importantly raises awareness of the kidnapped victimsâ plight, it also raises their perceived value as a bargaining chip for Hamas.ISRAELI POLICE SAY EXTREME SEXUAL VIOLENCE, RAPE BY HAMAS TERRORISTS WAS SYSTEMATICThe exact opposite result is the goal. Hamas should be answering to theUnited Nationsregarding why they kidnapped unlawful combatants â pregnant women, the elderly and infants. Instead, Israel is on trial by negative world opinion as they try to ensure that Hamas cannot do it again.It is time to get back to a coherent hostage policy based on historical precedents and not one pandering to wishful thinking.Humanizing the hostages while minimizing their perceived worth to the hostage taker is critical. Having senior U.S. government officials, including the president, publicly admit his involvement in ongoing hostage negotiations does not help the situation and can potentially sabotage it and even hinder future hostage releases.It is a far cry from the perceived, \"the US does not negotiate with terrorists\" rule we once adhered to. While the aforementioned was never official US hostage policy, making no concessions was. From 2004 to 2006, coordinating hostage-recovery efforts in Iraq, theÂ National Security Presidential DirectiveonUnited States Citizens Taken Hostage Abroad â U.S. hostage policy was:\"The U.S. Government will make no concessions to individuals or groups holding official or private U.S. citizens hostage. The United States will use every appropriate resource to gain the safe return of U.S. citizens who are held hostage. At the same time, it is U.S. Government policy to deny hostage takers the benefits of ransom, prisoner releases, policy changes, or other acts of concession.\"In 2014, theObama administrationannounced the exchange of an American soldier who deserted his post for five senior ranking Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders from the White House Rose Garden.Former President Barack Obama, right, watches as Bob Bergdahl and Jami Bergdahl discuss the release of their son, Bowe Bergdaghl.(Reuters)The president essentially announced to the world,Â \"The USdoesnegotiate with terrorists and the US makes concessions to terrorismâ¦\"IRAN HOSTAGE VICTIM ON PARALLELS BETWEEN 1979 CRISIS, GAZA CAPTIVES: IRAN'S FINGERPRINTS 'ARE ALL OVER THIS'In 2016, on the same day the U.S. formally implementedÂ the nuclear deal with Iran the Obama administration secretly arranged a planeÂ delivery ofÂ $400 millionÂ inÂ cash to Tehran to secure the release of four Iranian-American prisoners.On September 12, the Biden administration released $6 billion to Iran in an American-Iranian prisoner swap.Paying a Vikingâs ransom to secure the release of hostages and achieve policy goals confirmed for Iran, the leading state-sponsor of terrorism, and their proxies like Hamas, that the U.S. is willing to pay the modern-day \"Dane-geld\" or Viking tribute.\"Dane-geld\" is a poem by British writer Rudyard Kipling highlighting the recklessness of paying off the Vikings with gold in what the modern world calls blackmail. The most famous lines are \"once you have paid him the Danegeld/ You never get rid of the Dane.\"CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONPresident Biden personally injected himself into the current hostage crisis. This raised the hope of ten American families expecting their loved ones to be in the first tranche of released hostages. To Hamas, it proved how invaluable holding Americans is to their survival strategy. All the president did was raise the price of Dane-geld for the remaining U.S. citizenâs release.Only one American family is celebrating a reunion today.Combatting hostage-terrorism requires efforts that are better kept in the clandestine shadows versus global press conferences.Paying the \"Dane\" only demonstrates on a global stage that the world can be held hostage byterrorist organizationsforcing nation states to bend a knee to their demands for ransom, ceasefire, or humanitarian aid for \"oppression\" they self-inflicted.Like historical precedent in Iraq, countries like France, Germany, and Italy that paid out millions in ransoms to secure the release of hostages, it only puts a bigger target on their passport holders traveling in the region and the rest of the world.American hostages arrive at Wiesbaden Air Base in West Germany after being released from the U.S. Embassy in Iran on January 20, 1981. They had been held captive for 444 days since November 4, 1979.(Â Photo by Colin Davey/Getty Images)It is time to get back to a coherent hostage policy based on historical precedents and not one pandering to wishful thinking.The hope that paying millions in ransoms yesterday would not lead to paying billions today has led to thehostage crisis in Gaza.As Kipling so wisely wrote, \"You will find it better policy to say: --\"We never pay any-one Dane-geld/No matter how trifling the cost; For the end of that game is oppression & shame/ And the nation that plays it is lost!\"Making concessions to terrorism only encourages more of it.Bowing to enemies who consider America the Great Satan only emboldens more acts of terrorism.Commander Dan OâShea is a retired Navy SEAL. He established and served as the Coordinator of the Hostage Working Group US Embassy (Baghdad) Iraq from 2004-2006.Â  O'Shea arrived at the height of the Al Qaeda inspired hostage-taking crisis where 40-50 foreigners were being kidnapped every month.Â He managed the inter-agency coordination of more than 400 hostage-taking incidents during his time in Iraq. Kidnappings were in single digits with only one hostage incident in the final month of his tour.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
