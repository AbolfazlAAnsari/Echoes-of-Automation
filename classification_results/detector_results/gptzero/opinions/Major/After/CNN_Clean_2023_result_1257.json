(Trump denies wrongdoing.)It should be unthinkable for a party that once prided itself on advancing freedom at home and abroad to nominate a candidateformulating autocratic plansfor the presidency, policies which are protectionist in the economy, isolationist in foreign policy andadmiring of dictatorsaround the world. Trump, who has professed love for North Korea's Kim Jung Un and shown fealty to Russia's Vladimir Putin, is now regularly praising China's president-for-life Xi Jinping on the stump.This is the opposite of Republicanism in the Reagan tradition. But Trump's polarizing cult of personality - combined with the cowardice and careerism of too many Republican elected officials - has made this dangerous situation all too real for our country.There is still time for Republicans to choose an actual constitutional conservative to be their nominee - but according to polls they seem to prefer the \"narcissistic autocrat\" instead.Given his deep unpopularity outside the Republican base, it's unlikely that Trump would win the popular vote in a general election - especially given the fact that he's never won the popular vote; he was elected in 2016 thanks to the Electoral College. But the idea of majoritarian democracy isactively being undercutinside the Trumpified GOP. If he returns to the White House,  there will be no guardrails among Republicans to constrain his goal of political revenge. Our autocratic enemies would welcome the nation's division and decline.That's why it's important to listen to Liz Cheney'sclear-eyed callto arms from her new best-selling book: \"Every one of us - Republican, Democrat, Independent - must work and vote together to ensure that Donald Trump and those who have appeased, enabled, and collaborated with him are defeated...This is the cause of our time.\"Opinion by John Avlon, CNNTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
