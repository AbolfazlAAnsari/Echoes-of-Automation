Witnesses cannot avoid knowing that the media is watching, hanging onto every word. Whether a trial is televised or not, witnesses are often accosted and recorded for broadcasting outside the courthouse as they arrive to testify.There is no empirical data to support a claim that adding one small, stationary and silent camera in the courtroom adds to witnesses' stress beyond what they already suffer knowing that reporters are in the courtroom, reporting on their testimony.Televising trials will lead to grandstanding by attorneys and even judges.There is no data to support this claim. In fact, in afour-year pilot programconducted by the Federal Judicial Center studying video recordings of courtroom proceedings in 14 federal district courts, the views on the extent to which cameras affected attorneys' conduct were evenly split. One third of the judges surveyed thought that the hypothesized negative impact of cameras did not materialize. Rather, the judges observed that attorneys were prompted to come to court better prepared and to be more courteous.Similarly, attorneys who participated in the program agreed that grandstanding likely occurred to no or a small extent. The most likely impact, according to the attorneys, was to provide the viewing public with a more positive view of theproceedings. If an attorney or a judge is apt to grandstand, the available evidence is that it does not matter if the proceedings are televised. Just having reporters covering a trial in the courtroom is enough to encourage grandstanding.Cameras would place an increased burden on judges.Opponents have expressed concerns that judges would become responsible for policing the cameras, thereby diverting them from their primary obligation to ensure a fair trial. This argument makes no sense knowing that judges must address far greater thornier legal issues than making sure the unobtrusive camera is operating properly.Judges already are preoccupied with ruling on complex objections, evidentiary issues and disruptive conduct by lawyers, defendants and spectators. Having a stationary camera in the courtroom hardly adds to the judge's burden to control the courtroom. If cameras are permitted to televise Trump's trial, any violator of the court's rules can be banished from the courtroom.Jurors will be negatively affected by cameras.Having participated in televised state jury trials, I have never heard that the presence of a single camera added to a juror's concerns or fears.The media is typically instructed by the court not to show the faces of jurors or disclose their identity. And there is more that courts can do to protect jurors.Judges already have the authority to empanel anonymous jurors in highly charged cases, to ensure that their identity will not be known to the defendant, prosecutor or public. This has been done in federal courts throughout the country in cases involvingorganized crime and terrorism. There is no data showing that jurors in those cases have been incapable of rendering a fair verdict.Cameras will cause witnesses to be more hesitant to testify.This ignores the reality that witnesses are rarely thrilled to testify in court even in the absence of cameras. In high-profile cases, such as Trump's trial, witnesses will be aware that even if cameras are prohibited inside the courtroom, reporters and cameras will be everywhere else chasing them down, documenting their every word and movement.The Supreme Court should accept that there is no data to justify prohibiting Trump's trial from being televised, and immediately remove Rule 53 as an obstacle. Speculation is not enough reason to prevent Americans from bearing witness to the prosecution of a former president charged with subverting the electoral process.Whether or not cameras are permitted, we know that Trump will continue toimpugn the integrity of the proceedings, prosecutor and judge, twist the testimony and repeat his debunked conspiracy theories. His disturbing behavior that was on full display duringWednesday's court proceedingswill undoubtedly continue during his upcoming criminal trial.The American people are entitled to see and hear for themselves what goes on in the courtroom so that they can draw their own conclusions from the evidence.Opinion by Robert GottliebTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
