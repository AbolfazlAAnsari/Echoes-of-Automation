Can’t they just do Shakespeare the way he wrote it?”You can’t make this stuff up.Bradford FarwellSeattleThreats to Democracy, in Israel and ElsewhereTo the Editor:Re “Women Worry as Israel’s Far Right Pushes Sex Segregation” (front page, Aug. 13):Having spent nearly all of my professional life working for Jewish organizations on behalf of Israel and Soviet Jews, I, like many American Jews, am now disheartened about Israel’s encroachment on women’s rights.The subjugation of women in Israel is gaining ground — in worship, law, everyday commerce and young people’s education.Israel is the recipient of not only American government financial aid but also millions of dollars from American Jews who support Israeli schools, hospitals and the Israeli government.How long, however, will this support continue? Who wants to support a country that subjugates women? Didn’t we already go through this in the United States?Look around, Israel, and see who won that struggle! We stand tall and proud in support of Israeli women.Sheila LevinBronxTo the Editor:I am an 87-year-old man, a Jew and a native of Argentina.It looks as if before I depart from this world things will be getting worse.In Israel, the threat to democracy appears imminent and may become inevitable.In Argentina, the economic and social chaos is well established and appears irreversible.In Poland, the country of my parents, there is now an autocracy and it appears permanent.In the United States, my adopted country, it appears that there is a real threat that we may fall into disarray and disorder.I share my pain with millions of others who have wished for a better world for our children.David S. CantorLos AngelesOur Flawed SystemTo the Editor:Re “What Trump’s Indictment Reveals,” by Jamelle Bouie (column, Aug. 6), which discusses the flaws of our electoral system:Mr. Bouie’s analysis is, as usual, insightful and spot on, though his prescription is as fanciful as the underlying problem is deep-rooted: “If we truly hope to avoid another Jan. 6, or something worse, we have to deal with our undemocratic system as much as we do with the perpetrators of that particular incident.”Yes, but how? Constitutional amendment? Bipartisan legislation? A bewitching nose wiggle? The first two solutions are unrealistic since they would be blocked by those who benefit from (and increasingly depend upon) a less “perfect union.”Dan StoneCenterport, N.Y.How to Remember the Infant in the Car SeatTo the Editor:Re “Technology Can Save Children in Hot Cars. It Isn’t Mandated” (front page, Aug. 11):The second sentence of your headline should read, “It Isn’t Needed.” There is a shockingly low-tech solution that can be implemented immediately.Simply attach a long strap from the bottom of the infant car seat that snakes under the driver’s seat and attaches to the upper arm of the driver. The strap should be long enough that it doesn’t impede the driver nor pose a choking hazard to the infant (as it attaches to the bottom of the seat).The driver cannot exit the car without removing the strap and, feeling the restraint, recall, “Ah, yes, baby in the back.” Cost: Maybe $10.Problem: It requires that the parent show mindfulness both in securing their infant and in exiting their vehicle.Sharon R.
