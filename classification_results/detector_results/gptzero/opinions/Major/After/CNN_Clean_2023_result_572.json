But she and other self-styled housewife activists held themselves out as women who worked in, and defended, the private sphere of home and family.Housewife activistswould continue to be a mainstay of the right in the decades that followed. But by the 1990s, they were competing with a new model of right-wing antifeminists: women who emphasized their professional training and commitment to their careers.These included the women ofthe Independent Women's Forum, founded in the early 1990s, and antifeminist lawyers, such as Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham, who leveraged their attacks on feminism into robust media careers. They traded Schlafly's housedresses and deference forleopard-print miniskirtsand ribald jokes. And they used economic independence and changing cultural norms to forge personal lives and professional personae that didn't rely on being wives or mothers.Perhaps because their lives and careers often looked similar to those of feminists, they regularly bolstered their antifeminist credentials. Ingraham's first book, \"The Hillary Trap,\" wasa broadside against liberal feminism; Coulteronce fantasizedabout stripping women of the right to vote.In recent years, right-wing women antifeminists have added a new argument to their portfolio, one that came up in Kelly's tirade against the USWNT.As so often happenson Kelly's show, her attacks on the team quickly transformed into attacks on trans women.Rapinoe, she said,supports the ideaof trans women playing on the national team, just another reason the team deserved to lose. The argument was part of Kelly'sbroader assertionthat trans rights are anti-woman, and the real defenders of women's rights today are those people who work to deny trans people access to facilities that match their gender identity (and refuse, as Kelly does, touse their preferred pronouns).Over the past few decades, right-wing women have adopted what seems like a have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too sort of antifeminism. It is a way of keeping the patriarchy palatable: You don't have to be atradwifeto reject feminism.But in reality, as a woman antifeminist, you can have your cake, so long as you don't really eat it. You can have a high-powered, high-paying job, so long as you argue against equal pay. You can be bawdy and enjoy sex - no \"myth of the female orgasm\" here - so long as you roll your eyes at rape culture and insist the #MeToo movement went too far.You can beat the drum of \"women's rights\" and defend tooth-and-nail women's sports, so long as you only do so to denigrate trans women. You can celebrate \"Barbie,\" so long as you don't really buy into its criticism of the patriarchy.Which is a reminder that, when it looks like right-wing women are breaking ranks, nothing fundamental is actually changing. It's at best a bit of sleight of hand, one they've been practicing for decades.Opinion by Nicole HemmerTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
