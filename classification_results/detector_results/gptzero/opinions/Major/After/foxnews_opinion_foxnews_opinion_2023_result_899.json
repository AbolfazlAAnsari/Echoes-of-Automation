Both are contemptible — one is criminal.In addition to lying, Lew neglected to tell Congress that his department was traveling the world to encourage foreign countries to do business with Iran. According to a report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Treasury and State Department officials conducted over 200 \"roadshows\" in foreign cities to encourage economic engagement with Tehran.The committee found that \"the roadshows amounted to the U.S. government telling the world that Iran was open for business, as long as the rest of the world left the United States out of it.\"The Senate should not confirm a man who has lied to it through both omission and overt dishonesty. The Senate should likewise refuse to confirm a man who has acted as the de facto banker and business agent of the ayatollahs to serve as America’s representative in Israel.Both the United States and Israel need a U.S. ambassador in Jerusalem that is worthy of their confidence. Both nations deserve better than Lew. President Biden should withdraw Lew’s nomination and select an honest champion of the American-Israeli alliance in his place.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.
