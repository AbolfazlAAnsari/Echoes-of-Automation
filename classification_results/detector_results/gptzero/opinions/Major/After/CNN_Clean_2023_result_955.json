(\"Pro-Palestinian\" is in quotations because you can, of course, be pro-Palestinian without supporting genocidal terrorism.) A coalition of student groups at Harvard University, for instance,put out a statementthat they \"hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.\" Some of those groups and students did eventually walk their statements back, but while Harvard's was particularly egregious, it was notthe onlysuch incident.Thankfully, someheroic citizens in the corporate worldhave issued a response. Students may have the right to openly support murder, but hedge fund CEO Bill Ackmanexplainedthat he and his fellow business leaders have a legitimate interest in knowing their names so they never inadvertently hire any of them. When a New York University Law student released a statement similarly hideous to Harvard's, the law firm of Winston and Strawn exercised its own right torescindthe student's employment offer.Now these figures are going directly to the top. After mealy-mouthed administrators at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania seemedhesitantto respond to the massacre or to use the word \"terrorist,\" majordonors announced they wereclosing their checkbooks and resigning from university boardsin protest.These actions are welcome, but more must be done. Donors and anyone else concerned about the climate on campus should urge administrators to hold accountable student groups whose speech crosses the line into territory not protected by the Constitution.In particular, one of the major pro-Palestinian student groups,Students for Justice in Palestine(SJP), demands reining in. The national organization issued a \"call to action\" for students to participate in a \"National Day of Resistance\" last Thursday, and affiliates across the country haveplannedmore eventsin thenearfuture.The words and imagery used in SJP's call to action arenothing short of frightening. Its Instagram account featured a graphic of aparaglider in a clear referenceto the means some Hamas terrorists used to infiltrate Israel. \"Today, we witness a historic win for the Palestinian resistance ... reminding each of us that total return and liberation to Palestine is near,\" the accompanying text stated. \"The Palestinian resistance has captured over a dozen settlements surrounding Gaza along with many occupation soldiers and military vehicles. This is what it means to Free Palestine: not just slogans and rallies, but armed confrontation with the oppressors.\" The organization repeated that text in atool kit it suppliedfor the action, accompanied by an extra line: \"National liberation is near - glory to our resistance, to our martyrs and to our steadfast people.\"Thepresence of at least one anti-Zionist student group such as SJPhas long been correlated with antisemitic incidents on campuses. But SJP crossed a new line when it openly encouraged its members to rally in support of a terror group whosechartercalls for theannihilationofJews, everywhere, separate from the clauses vowing the obliteration of the State of Israel. Many Jewish students have already been fearful of ostracization whenattending classes or expressing their identity. Butfearfor their physical safety is becoming ever more acute.Universities, take note: Your lack of action is complicity.While several university presidents havespoken out, to their credit, many more need to join them. And they all must do more when students glorify the actions of Hamas - aUS-designated foreign terrorist organization- and support \"armed confrontation.\"First, underTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, institutions that take federal funds have an obligation to protecttheir Jewishstudents - including fromotherstudent groups. Per the US Department of Education'sOffice for Civil Rights, speech becomes harassing conduct when it is \"sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to interfere with or limit\" the ability of students to join in or benefit from a university's services or activities. Many Jewish students (evensomeprofessors) are literallyafraid to go to class. Stanford Law School movedclasses to Zoomlast Friday out of concerns over violence. If the words of Title VI mean anything, they must protect against environments like this.Second, all private universities have the right to shut down hateful protests without triggering any constitutional issues. Public universities are more constrained, but underTinker v. Des Moinesand its progeny - whichcourtshaveappliedtouniversities- schools can shut down speech that will \"materially and substantially interfere\" with the \"requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school\" or \"invad[e] the rights of others.\" Schools don't have to wait for trouble; they can ban expression in advance if they can \"reasonably forecast\" that it will violate those standards.InMelton v. Young, for instance, school officials were allowed to prohibit the wearing of a Confederate flag because it was reasonable to assume it would be disruptive in an environment of racial tension. Shouting \"all of us are Hamas\" while declaring that support for Palestinians \"includes violence\" and condoning \"armed confrontation\" is certainly no less likely to cause a disruption. Moreover,SJP rallieshave sometimes turnedviolent in the past. Predictably, some did lastweekas well.Finally, it is afederal crimeif someone \"knowingly provides material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization.\" UnderHolder v. Humanitarian Law Project, that can include even some speech if done \"under the direction of, or in coordination with foreign groups that the speaker knows to be terrorist organizations.\"For instance,United States v. Osadzinskiheld that merely translating ISIS videos into English for pro-ISIS media organizations \"clearly constituted 'concerted activity'\" in violation of the statute, even if there was no interaction with an actual member of the terrorist group.In sponsoring and prepping the Day of Resistance events, SJP provided its chapters withpublic relations materials, instructing, \"We must act as part of this movement. All of our efforts continue the work and resistance of the Palestinians on the ground.\" As such, the government should carefully monitor SJP's behavior. Indeed, some lawmakers have alreadyrecognizedthe problem and started callingfor actionalong these lines.SJP and other student groups can take the side ofbarbaric baby killers, but as donors and employers taught them this week, free speech has consequences. And accountability does not end there; university and government officials have responsibilities as well.If and when speech crosses the line into discriminatory harassment, schools must remove their imprimatur from that evil while making sure to protect targeted communities, and they should proactively shut down events that are likely to cause material disruption or infringe the rights of others. At the very least, schools with applicable conduct codes should defund and/orrevoke the charters of any organizationthat openly supports a group whose stated desire is to kill other members of the campus community.Opinion by Mark GoldfederTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
