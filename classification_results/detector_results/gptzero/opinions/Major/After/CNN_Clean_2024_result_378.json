This week, theOlympic flame was litin Olympia amid choreographed pomp and pageantry. The flame will wend its way to Paris where earlier this week French President Emmanuel Macronrevealedthat, in light of potential security threats, Olympic organizers have devised a backup plan for the Games' audacious opening ceremony, which is planned toflow down the Seine riverwith a boat for each country's delegation.The contrast between celebration and seriousness spotlights how the 2024 Paris Olympics will not only be a festival of sport, but also a smorgasbord of security measures.The Olympics have along track recordof supporting the augmentation of host cities' and countries' state power through the passage of special laws and the procurement of sophisticated equipment. To manycivil liberties advocates, the Games have become a smiley-faced ruse for soft-launching surveillance technologies that too often remain in place after the Games' closing ceremony, largelynormalizinginvasive security practices.To be sure, the Olympics have a grim history with instances of terrorism. Exhibit A: the1972 Munich Gameswhere 11 Israeli athletes and coaches were killed after being taken hostage by affiliates of Black September, a Palestinian militant group. A German police officer was also killed. Exhibit B: the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics wherea bomb explosionleft two people dead and injured more than 100.The stature and scope of the eventmake the Olympics an attractive targetfor violent extremists.That coupled with Paris' recent experiences with terrorism - foremost, the2015 coordinated attacks for which ISIS took responsibilitythat included suicide bomberstargetingthe Stade de France - are among the factors fueling government officials' assertion that thethreat of terrorismhanging over this summer's Games requires elaborate security systems.But that same high-tech architecture can be flipped for use against activists expressing political dissent.France enacted anOlympic Games Lawin May 2023 that legalized the use of AI-driven video surveillance this summer and allowed experimentation with intelligent video surveillance until March 31, 2025. The law made Francethe first nationin the European Union to greenlight biometric surveillance systems. A gaggle of human rights groups - including Amnesty International, the European Civic Forum and Human Rights Watch - blasted the law,writingin Le Monde that it was \"a worrying precedent,\" noting the legislation's \"unjustified and disproportionate surveillance in public spaces, to the detriment of fundamental rights and freedoms.\"Noemie Levain, a lawyer with the Paris-based digital rights groupLa Quadrature du Net, agrees. She told me that the Olympic Law \"infringes the right to privacy, the right to be anonymous in the streets.\"\"Everything in this is political,\" Levain said. \"Public space is a political space. This is where you demonstrate. This is where you act the way you want. This is where there is the freedom of expression.\"She added that AI-driven surveillance \"is a way to shape public space according to the values of the government and police - and in the end, it will always be poor people, people from minority communities, migrants, political activists who will be targets.\"Researchhas found that AI technologies can reinforce systemic racism, what some call \"techno-racism.\"French officials have insisted that intensified surveillance is necessary to preserve public safety during the Olympic period. Speaking last month at a government hearing, Interior Minister Gerald Darmaninsaid, \"This is, for the Ministry of the Interior, the biggest logistical and security challenge we've ever had to organize.\" France's Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Casteraaddedthat the surveillance measure \"is very precisely limited in time.\" Moreover, she noted, \"the algorithm does not substitute for human judgement, which remains decisive.\"France's AI-powered surveillance isslated to sunsetat the end of March 2025. But in December the European Parliamentagreed on a framework forthe AI Act -dubbing ita landmark \"deal on comprehensive rules for trustworthy AI\" - which could potentially extend AI surveillance across Europe. While the actregulateshigh-risk AI systems that \"can potentially create an adverse impact on people's health, safety or their fundamental rights,\" it alsoallowsfor \"remote biometric identificationby law enforcement authorities in public spaces, subject to safeguards.\" These safeguards include conspicuously capaciousexemptionsfor law enforcement, allowing AI use for the \"prevention of a specific and present terrorist threat\" and \"the localisation or identification of a person suspected of having committed one of the specific crimes,\" such as murder, \"participation in a criminal organisation\" or \"environmental crime.\" Last month, the European Union officiallyapprovedthe act.Beyond AI-driven surveillance, at least 70,000 security officials will be deployed at the Games, including around35,000 police officers,15,000 soldiersfrom France's military and20,000 private securityguards. France's Interior Ministry hasaskednumerous foreign countries to send members of their own security forces to help police the Games. To secure the domestic private security force in time, the training course is reportedly being shortened, with the normal amount of formal preparationreducedfrom 175 hours to 106. Even this hasn't worked.French officialsplacedthe country on its highest terror alert level last month after a terrorist attack in Moscow. Meanwhile, 400 security cameras will beaddedin Paris, bringing the total to around 4,400. The French Ministry of the Armed Forcesunveiled plans to useHELMA-P, an anti-drone laser weapon system prototype, at the Paris Games. The Opening Ceremony, originally expected to include some 600,000 spectators, will become a literalno-fly zone. As if to underscore the security complexities, the French government recentlyannouncedthat it halved the number of Opening Ceremony spectators. Now Macron hassuggestedthat the ceremony could be moved to the Trocadero or the Stade de France, should a serious security threat emerge.Natsuko Sasaki, an activist with the anti-Games groupSaccage 2024, told me that the French government's high-tech laws, weapons and bolstered security force comprised a \"lockdown methodology\" that \"limits the choice of activists to legally protest,\" curtailing democracy itself. Activists may beless inclinedto express their dissent if they know that AI-driven systems are tracking their every move and banking their data for potential future use, what some surveillancescholars refer toas \"chilling effects.\"Meanwhile, with minimal consultation with elected officials, Paris Police Chief Laurent Nunezsaid in an interview with Le Parisienthat motorists and residents who live near Olympic venues must apply online to secure a QR code that will allow them to access traffic-restricted zones in the city during the Paris Games. This has raised ire across the political spectrum, with many arguing that France has gone too far, sacrificing the civil liberties of everyday people on the altar of Olympic spectacle. One member of parliament on the leftrespondedto the digital surveillance by asserting, \"The Olympic Games will have a liberticidal taste.\" The far-right Les Patriotes Party slammed the QR codes as a \"frightening spectacle\" andorganizeda public protest in mid-December at the Palais Royal in central Paris against the \"totalitarian experience\" of the Olympics.Danielle Simonnet, a member of France's National Assembly representing the left-of-center La France Insoumise Party, told me in no uncertain terms that \"the Olympics are a pretext for accelerating a policy of generalized surveillance.\" This may be contributing to the fact that Parisians are souring on the 2024 Games. A recent pollfoundthat 44% of respondents in the Paris region thought that the Olympics were a \"bad thing,\" with those opining that the Games are a \"good thing\" declining significantly over time; transportation and security were most often rated as concerns.International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach recentlystatedthat the Paris 2024 Olympics \"will be a turning point in history: more sustainable, more urban, more inclusive, with gender parity - Games wide open.\" All that is debatable. But what's clear is that Paris 2024 could tilt France - and perhaps the wider European Union - in a more surveillance-drenched, repressive direction.Opinion by Jules BoykoffTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
