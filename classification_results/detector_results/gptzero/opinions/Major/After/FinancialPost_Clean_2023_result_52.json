The discussion surrounding this study has emphasized the \"$100-billion difference,\" which makes it seem as if attaining net zero will cost Canada $100 billion in lost GDP in 2050, with $60 billion of that, the study says, occurring in Alberta. A \"$100-billion difference\" in the context of what will be a $3.5 trillion-dollar economy by 2050 probably implied to some people that the cost is too small to worry about.Unfortunately, this gives a misleading indication of what the PPF/Navius analysis actually found. What the study in fact did was to estimate the difference in costs among three different net-zero scenarios, with costs measured in reduced GDP in 2050. But it did not estimate \"the cost of net zero.\" Hardly anyone does!In the first scenario examined, emissions reductions are achieved on the basis of \"announced policy,\" that is, the federal government's 2022 Emissions Reduction Plan(https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-plan/climate-plan-overview/emissions-reduction-2030.html) (ERP), which even Ottawa acknowledges will not fully attain net zero without additional measures. In the second, \"accelerated scenario,\" emissions reductions are achieved on the basis of the ERP, plus an economy-wide cap on net-zero emissions in 2050. Finally, the third scenario adds an explicit phase-out of oil and gas production starting in 2035 and reaching a 95 per cent reduction from 2015 levels by 2050. This third option was proposed by the International Institute for Sustainable Development, Environmental Defence Canada and the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance.In summary, the three cases studied were: option one, the policy status quo; option two, the status quo plus a 2050 economy-wide net-zero cap; and option three, the status quo, plus the 2050 net-zero cap plus a phase-out of oil and gas starting in 2035. There was no option zero, however - no examination of Canada not pursuing net zero.The report concluded that option two (the status quo plus the net-zero cap) would reduce Canada's GDP by $200 billion in 2050 compared to just the policy status quo, while option three, adding in the complete phase-out of Canada's oil and gas production, would increase the loss in 2050 to $300 billion.The $100-billion figure you may have heard about thus refers to the difference in costs between options two and three. The PPF report concluded that this extra $100 billion was not justified by the in fact rather small additional emissions reductions from phasing out oil and gas production.And that's true even though their estimate of the incremental cost of phasing out oil and gas production is almost certainly too low. According to a statistical overview(https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/media/3792944/iveyenergycentre_policybrief_dec2020_energyinca_overview_editedjan13.pdf) by the Ivey Business School, in 2019 Canada's oil and gas industry alone accounted for almost $150 billion in GDP, or 7.5 per cent of Canada's total. Wiping it out all but entirely should produce a loss at least in that range, as well as further costs all across the Canadian economy. That even the Public Policy Forum, which has been an active advocate for net zero, thinks wiping out oil and gas would be a mistake should be an important source of moderation in Ottawa's clampdown on the industry.But what's also important to realize is that the PPF/Navius report did not present an estimate of the policy status quo compared to rejecting non zero as a policy objective.
