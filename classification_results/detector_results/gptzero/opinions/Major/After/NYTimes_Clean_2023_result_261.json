Simply grading harder does not address nor repair the fundamental brokenness of contemporary grading; it would only put one’s own students at a disadvantage to those enrolled in more generously graded classes.Yes, grading is a hollow and arguably useless metric at present. Let’s acknowledge this reality and move to institute more comprehensive, transparent metrics for our students, if not instead of grades, then in spite of them.Matt MoroneHillsdale, N.J.The writer is a high school English teacher.Hernia OperationsTo the Editor:Re “Lucrative Hernia Surgery Injures Many Patients” (“Operating Profits” series, front page, Oct. 30):As leaders of the American Hernia Society, we are disturbed by the imbalanced portrayal in your article of hernia surgeons performing advanced techniques.Component separation has increased in use over many years with improved outcomes in patients with complex ventral hernias. Peer-reviewed publications continue to demonstrate that robotics results in lower rates of complications, shorter recovery time and lower cost of care.Robotics has allowed all surgical areas to increase use of minimally invasive techniques. We continuously study surgical outcomes and complications to identify strategies to decrease complications.In addition to years of medical school and residency training, the American Hernia Society offers various resources to safely learn new procedures, including hands-on training and ongoing mentorship by experts.We continue to adhere to our drive for quality patient care, advancing the science and treatment of hernia and promoting the highest standards of professional skill and competence among abdominal wall surgeons.Archana RamaswamyLoma Linda, Calif.The writer is the president of the American Hernia Society.

When will the safety of elderly New Yorkers be considered as much as the convenience of bicyclists?Edward TempleBrooklynThis article appeared in print on page A25."
