It is surely also the fervent hope on which Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to pursue his carnage and the reason he has chanced his whole presidency on whatonce seemed like a sure bet, and is instead turning into a morass of quicksand and violence with no easy exit.America - and its allies - must under no circumstances allow that to happen.The dangers for Ukraine are even more profound than simply waffling by ahandful of right-wing Republicans in Congress over appropriations- those preparedto throw under the bus an entire nationto their overweening ambition and distrust of Democrats.Fissures are appearing across the hitherto united Western front that can only be sending shivers of joy up Putin's spine. The worst of it is that at least some of this has been Ukraine's own doing.Theslow pace of the counteroffensive, the rapidly expanding needs for ever more advanced weapons, the fears of enmeshing all of the NATO alliance in an expanded conflict and a host of more immediate issues have all converged in recent days into what could become a perfect storm of horrors for Ukraine.But first there is the sudden convergence of grain, food and politics. Putin quite rightly appreciated the stakes - and the opportunity - when he first launched hisheartless blockade of Ukraine's grain, grain that helps feed not only Europe but also vast stretches of Africa now plunged into the threat ofdevastating hunger.But Ukraine was not deterred. It found other avenues for its crops than the embargoed Black Sea ports. These trade routes, however, were across Ukraine's neighbors Poland and Slovakia, where politically powerful farming interestsfelt threatened by new, cheaper sources of supply pouring across their frontiers- even if most of it was destined for other markets abroad.Poland has a major parliamentary election coming up on October 15, and the government has recognized its need to pander to the roughly1.3 million Poles who describe themselves as farmers. They are a powerful voting bloc, dating back to the communist era when I was able to take the pulse of the Polish people by traveling to a chicken farm in the village of Bialobrzegi, 50 miles south of Warsaw, where, even then, one farmer I spoke to wasfearless in his disgust of a government he felt had lost interest in him and his priorities.Fast-forward some four decades later, and the Polish government this month reacted quickly to rural concerns. It - along with Slovakia and Hungary - defied the European Union and extended a ban on the import ofUkrainian grain.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, himself a master of the cut and thrusts of political theater, hasn't been reluctant to strike back,telling the UN General Assemblyin New York last week that \"it is alarming to see how some in Europe, some of our friends in Europe, play out solidarity in a political theater - making a thriller from the grain.\" The fear he enunciated is that they \"are helping set the stage to a Moscow actor.\"Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki quickly followed with a threat to halt the export of weapons to the country for which it was once a wholehearted supporter. (Poland has since moved towalk back those comments, promising that it will still send weapons it has already committed to provide.)Still, on the sidelines at the UN General Assembly, Polish President Andrzej Duda compared Ukraine to \"a drowning person clinging to anything available.\"Nearby Slovakia also has an election coming on Saturday, and it appears as though Robert Fico, former prime minister and leader of the populist Smer Party - which has campaigned on a pro-Russian message - isthe front-runner. On the campaign trail last week in the village of Banovce nad Bebravou, Ficoproclaimed:\"We are a peaceful country. We will not send a single round to Ukraine.\"Ukraine has only provided its detractors with more verbal ammunition bythreatening to file a suit in the World Trade Organizationagainst Poland, Hungary and Slovakia over their grain embargoes.There is a sense of toxic stasis that has a number of officials in other Western countries worried about how long they can continue to supply Ukraine at the pace to which it has become accustomed. \"Ukraine fatigue\" is spreading slowly but inexorably. This past week German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced his country would be sending a new round of arms shipments to Ukraine, butwithout the bunker-busting cruise missiles Kyiv had urgently requested.The problem is that all of this is converging at a delicate time. The EU is weighing up a mammoth four-year, 20 billion euro ($21.3 billion) fund tofinance weapons purchases for Ukraine.It requires, however, unanimous consent of all 27 member states - an increasingly heavy lift.Hungary continues to hew closely to the Kremlin's line and retains what has been an oftentoxic veto amid the rule of unanimity in all EU decision-making. And with Russia now eyeing up potentialweapons dealswith North Korea, Ukraine needs the West's support more than ever.The West has been waiting eagerly and increasingly anxiously for some significant progress in a still plodding summer offensivebefore fall rain and winter snow set in.Zelensky may also now be facing other troubles at home. InThe Timesof London this week, there was a dramatic report of growing threats of desertion, even rebellion by scattered Ukrainian troops, apparently fed up with corruption spreading through the ranks. The report came just as Zelensky is grappling with allegations of corruption in the military and beyond - earlier this month hesacked the defense minister, followed by thedismissal last week of six deputies. (The government gave no official reason for the dismissals.)What can America and the West do? The simple answer is, stand firm with Ukraine. It may not be easy, especially in the face of polls that showmore than half of voters oppose any more aid to Ukraine. Fortunately, there are still some leaders who will continue to lead. \"American support for Ukraine is not charity,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnellsaid Thursday. \"It's an investment in our own direct interests. Degrading Russia's military power helps to deter our primary strategic adversary, China.\"China does still appear to be avoiding tying itself too closely to Russia, congruent politically, but with waning military power that is a potential drag on its own image and capacities.\"When the hard right-wingers attempt in Congress to block renewed aid to Ukraine, they do Putin's work,\" Robert I. Rotberg, founding director of Harvard Kennedy School's Program on Intrastate Conflict,wrote this week. \"As such, they are Putin enablers.\"The same could equally be said for an all-too-rapidly expanding collection of leaders abroad.All parties, more than ever, need to act like allies and continue singing from the same songbook.Opinion by David A.
