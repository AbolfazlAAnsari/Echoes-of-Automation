            "inputText": "By Herbert GrubelLast September, Myles Sanderson(https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/americas/saskatchewan-canada-stabbing-myles-sanderson/index.html) stabbed and killed 11 people and injured 18 in several locations in Saskatchewan. Then in October Shaelyn Yang, an RCMP officer, was fatally stabbed in Burnaby(https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2022/10/18/burnaby-rcmp-incident/), British Columbia. Reading about these tragic events, I found myself wondering whether stabbings in Canada are taking the place of shootings as ever more legislation and enforcement make guns more difficult to own and buy.Statistics Canada(https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3510006801&;pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.1&;cubeTimeFrame.startYear=1961&;cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2021&;referencePeriods=19610101%2C20210101) tracks the different methods used to commit homicides every year. The nearby chart shows stabbings, shootings and total homicides from 1974 on (the period for which data are available). Until 1985, shootings trend markedly downward and stabbings upward. In 1974 shootings out-numbered stabbings three to one. In 1985 there were more stabbings (227) than shootings.The decade up to 1985 roughly coincides with legislation reducing the availability of guns. In 1968 firearms were divided into non-restricted, restricted, and prohibited categories, while 1977 changes to the Criminal Code introduced firearm acquisition certificates for rifles and shotguns and mandated record-keeping by arms dealers.From 1988 until 2013 stabbings and shootings fluctuated, with shootings exceeding stabbings in 15 years, mainly in the first half of the period, and stabbings exceeding shootings in 11 years, mainly in the second half. Over these years, there is a weak negative correlation between the two: when one goes up, the other goes down and vice versa.In 2014 the pattern changed. Both shootings and stabbings increased sharply. In 2021 shootings were up to 297, stabbings 242. Each is a record for its category.What explains this recent change?In 2012 the Conservatives eliminated the registration of unrestricted firearms, while in 2015 they relaxed controls on restricted and prohibited weapons. Even if these changes were responsible for the increase in shootings, however, they don't explain the increase in stabbings. Moreover, in 2018 the Liberals reinstated the record-keeping provisions from the 1977 laws, while in 2020 they banned 1,500 models of semi-automatic rifles. These latest laws have not yet reversed the increase in shootings that began in 2014. Both the most recent increase in homicides and the disappearance of the negative correlation between shootings and stabbings seem likely to be due to developments other than gun control legislation.The Statistics Canada data also show, somewhat gruesomely, other methods used to commit homicides. Among them, \"strangulations\" and \"beatings\" together averaged about 30 per cent of the total from 1974 to 2021. To complete the grim catalogue: \"burns or suffocation,\" \"other\" and \"unknown\" together accounted for eight per cent of the total, though again with no obvious correlation with shootings or stabbings.I have not been able to find any published research on the apparent negative correlation between shootings and stabbings. But, as an economist, I don't find it surprising. The substitution principle is basic in economics. When the cost of something rises, less of it is bought and more is spent on other goods. Scholars may well find other explanations for the negative correlation, but until they do, I'll believe the substitution effect explains it. Make guns harder to use and people will turn to knives.William Watson: School lunches are best prepared by parents, not Ottawa(https://financialpost.com/opinion/school-lunches-best-prepared-parents-not-ottawa)Matthew Lau: When climate policy is all error, doing nothing could be good(https://financialpost.com/opinion/climate-policy-error-doing-nothing-good)This inverse correlation between shootings and stabbings might have important implications for evaluating gun control legislation. Consider the 1974-88 decline in firearm homicides from 283 to 169, a reduction of 114. Over this period, homicides using knives rose from 93 to 169 or by 76. If people intent on killing merely switched from guns to knives, the reduction in homicides attributable to gun control legislation was not 114 but 38 (i.e., the reduction in gun killings of 114 minus the increase in knife killings of 76). If such legislation had saved 114 lives, that obviously considerable benefit may well have exceeded its possibly considerable cost. But if it saved only 38 lives, maybe the calculation turns out differently.In any honest accounting, the costs of gun control can be substantial. There are the costs of registration incurred by the government, dealers, and individuals; of compliance with and enforcement of the legislation; of the loss of people's freedom to use firearms for sport, hunting and personal protection. Estimates of the cost of the federal government's plan to buy back millions of Canadians' firearms run into the billions of dollars. All these costs may be worth incurring if gun controls reduce homicides by 114 (using the numbers above) but not if the reduction is only 38.Herbert Grubel is emeritus professor of economics at Simon Fraser University and a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
