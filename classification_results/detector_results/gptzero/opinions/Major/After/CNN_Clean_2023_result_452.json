The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Readmore opinionat CNN.In the years I was a full-time comedian touring the nation, I saw firsthand some tough crowds. But what GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham was subjected to at former President Donald Trump's rally Saturday in Graham's home state of South Carolina was far worse than I ever personally witnessed. In a word, it was a bloodbath.The jeeringbeganas soon as Graham was introduced to the Trump faithful. At first, Grahamappearedamused by the crowd's boos - even laughing about it. Shortly after taking the stage, the senator playfully turned to audience members behind him where a woman in MAGA gear could be seen booing him to his face while holding out a pronounced thumbs-down.However, Graham soon began to grasp that a large segment of this Trump crowd - some of whom were yelling \"traitor\" - was not kidding around. From there, the lawmaker went into grovel mode as he tried to win over the audience withlinessuch as, \"Just calm down for a second. I think you'll like this.\" Graham then told the audience, \"I was born in this county,\" adding, \"I live 15 miles down the road. This is a place where people pay the taxes, fight the wars and tell you what they believe.\"Graham even tried a joke to get the crowd on his side,stating, \"I found common ground with President Trump. It took a while to get there, folks.\" He then quipped, \"I come to like President Trump and he likes himself ... and we got that in common.\" (Pro tip from a comedian: If you are bombing with an audience, don't mock the person the crowd loves!) After about six minutes of boos that effectivelydrownedhim out, Graham left the stage.Later when Trump took the podium, heneedledGraham, saying, \"You know you can make mistakes on occasion,\" adding, \"Even Lindsey down here, Sen. Lindsey Graham.\" When the crowd began to boo again, Trump \"half-heartedly defended\" Graham, according to The Greenville (South Carolina) News. In a joking voice, he said, \"We're gonna, we're gonna love him. We're gonna love him.\"I must admit it was fun to watch Graham bomb with the audience, but the roasting was another reminder of how some Trump supporters demand absolute loyalty to the former president. When Trump declared that everyone makes a \"mistake,\" including Graham, it appeared that the mistake was not being fully loyal to Trump.The Greenville paperinterviewedsome attendees, who expressed that very sentiment. One said he was tired of Graham's \"wishy-washiness,\" while another noted Graham only supported Trump when it helped him politically. Their message to all Republicans seemed to be: Remain completely loyal to Trump or you will face our wrath.As the 2016 presidential race first got underway, Graham was a critic of Trump,callinghim a \"race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot\" who \"doesn't represent my party,\" but he later became a stalwart ally - and frequentgolfing buddy.Grahamdismissed the 2021 Senate trialover the January 6 insurrection as \"an impeachment effort driven by passion and hatred against President Trump.\" And after aManhattan grand jury indicted Trumpin March on more than 30 felonies related to a hush money payment scheme to silence an adult film star, Graham appeared on Fox News andtearfully urged peopleto donate to Trump: \"Go tonight. Give the president some money to fight this bullsh*t!\"But Graham has been publicly critical of Trump since he left office. For example, in March 2022, Grahamsaidthat he thought it was \"a mistake\" for Trump to call Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"genius,\" noting that \"Putin's not a genius, he's a war criminal.\"And last month after Trump was charged with a slew of feloniesover mishandling classified documentsonce he left office, Grahamstated on ABC, \"I'm not justifying his behavior,\" adding, \"If it were up to me, nobody would take classified information in their garage or Mar-a-Lago.\"This demand for loyalty to Trump raises red flags since it's a common trait of authoritarian movements. For example, Yale University professorJason Stanley, author of \"How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them,\"explainedin a 2020 podcast interview with NPR member station KCRW that, \"Fascism is based on power, loyalty, and fear of the other. The fascist leader is infallible.\"Stanley noted at the time, \"Many of (Trump's) supporters see him as infallible. There's the denial of reality that is characteristic of fascism.\" Stanley continued, \"Remember (Trump's) comment, 'I could shootsomeone on Fifth Avenuein broad daylight and I wouldn't lose a single supporter?' That's a fascist connection of total loyalty,\" adding, \"His rallies are classic fascist rallies.\"New York University professor Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion and author of \"Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present,\" sees Trump as part of a new breed of authoritarians like Putin and Hungary's Viktor Orban. Ben-Ghiat toldTime magazinein November 2020, \"Strongmen are a subset of authoritarian who require total loyalty, bend democracy around (their) own needs.\"That demand for unquestioning loyalty to Trump helps us understand why a crowd in Pickens County, South Carolina, where Graham was born, and only 15 miles from where he now lives would so quickly turn on him. Those booing did not care that Grahamhas represented their statein the US House of Representatives, and then the US Senate, since 1995. All that matters is absolute loyalty to their beloved Trump.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
