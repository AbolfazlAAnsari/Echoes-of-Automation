In that circumstance, he summoned a sense of purpose in his plea for the very ones who were the cause of his agony. With a love so total and mission so clear, he could say, \"Father, forgive them…\" (Luke 23:34). Here is where Christ’s suffering is cosmic, taking into itself all suffering, and accomplishing something with it.It is almost as though Plato could foresee this dynamic of innocence thought to be unrighteous who would ‘…be scourged, tortured, bound... and at last, after suffering every evil, …be crucified' though eventually being vindicated (The Republic, Book II, 360-361). This vindication validates the whole of his message.It is not the preserve ofChristian myth-making, but the structure of human reality, that tells us the way purposeful sacrifice and even suffering, willingly undertaken, can bring redemption. And that is a message worth proposing to the those in our current culture who so often shun almost any form of discomfort and delayed gratification, failing to see that personal sacrifice can have nobility even when others only see shame and who instead flee to safe spaces of refuge from the discomfort that truth may immediately impose; but that Truth can also one day ultimately resolve.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM FR.
