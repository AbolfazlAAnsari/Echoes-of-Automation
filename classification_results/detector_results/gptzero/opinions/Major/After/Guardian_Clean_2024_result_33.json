(He first stood asH’Angus the monkey, Hartlepool United’s official mascot, on a ticket that promised to give every school child a free banana.)Every incoming British government swears it will reverse centralisation and restore power to local democracy. Apart from Blair’s hesitant innovation, none has done so.Keir Starmer, in a parody of Brexit, has said he recognises “the desire of communities tostand on their own feet– it’s what ‘take back control’ meant.” He promises to devolve “new powers over employment support, transport, energy, climate change, housing, culture, childcare provision and how councils run their finances”. Yet what do these vacuities mean, when at the same time he pledges to“bulldoze” restrictive planning rulesthat would prevent him delivering on his central housebuilding targets?Labour is about to take power with a crushing mandate to correct 14 years of Tory rule. Nowhere is correction more needed than in clearing the mess that is British local democracy. The slogan is simple: a mayor for every town and city, now. A proper one.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"
