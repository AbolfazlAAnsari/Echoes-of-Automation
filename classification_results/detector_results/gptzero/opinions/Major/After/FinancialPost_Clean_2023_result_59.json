We feel it right here in our neighbourhoods. To be sure, we belong here - and we know that we're welcomed by the vast majority of our fellow Canadians. But Jews constitute only one per cent of Canada's population. It would take no more than a hateful fringe - and a society of bystanders - for our country to become unwelcoming and unsafe for Jews. Stopping the spread of antisemitism and fostering upstanders who will speak out is a growing imperative, one that impacts the very fabric of Canadian society.Irwin Cotler: The lessons of the Holocaust remain sadly relevant today(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/lessons-of-the-holocaust-remain-sadly-relevant-today)Avi Benlolo: Without better Holocaust education, history will repeat itself(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/without-better-holocaust-education-history-will-repeat-itself)Education is an important part of the solution. But for most people, moral lessons are not absorbed from history texts. They're learned through lived experiences that change us in ways that endure. This explains why survivor testimony has had such an extraordinary impact within and beyond the Jewish community. Looking to a post-eyewitness future, we must unlock technology's enormous potential to open minds and change lives.The Toronto Holocaust Museum will pair cutting-edge digital tools with best-in-class pedagogy. Youth are at the centre of an audience experience created with immense detail by a team of museum professionals and survivor educators. Through hand-held tablets, interactive platforms, and a combination of virtual and augmented reality, visitors will take a personally curated journey. They can follow an individual survivor's story or absorb multiple testimonies to better understand the range of survivor experiences. For the thousands of students from across our diverse city who will visit the museum annually, what they encounter in just a few hours will be felt for years to come.Rabbi Joseph Telushkin remarked that his mother used to quip: \"When it's not terrible to be a Jew, it's wonderful.\" One may learn about antisemitism through the Holocaust. But one cannot truly learn about Jews through the lens of antisemitism, let alone experience the beauty of Jewish life, past and present.This is why the Toronto Holocaust Museum deliberately highlights the diversity of Jewish life before the war, while also paying tribute to Toronto-based survivors who contributed to Canadian society post-war. So too, the museum is deliberately located just steps away from the buzzing activities of the Prosserman Jewish Community Centre in North York. Visitors emerge with an appreciation of who Jews were - and who we are today - all in the heart of a thriving Jewish community in one of the world's most diverse cities.Because this too is what we safeguard, when we protect our collective memory for future generations.National PostJeff Rosenthal is Chair of the Board of UJA Federation of Greater Toronto.Adam Minsky is President and CEO of UJA Federation of Greater Toronto.The Toronto Holocaust Museum is located in the Charlotte &; Lewis Steinberg Family Cultural Pavilion within the Sheff Family Building (Sherman Campus, 4588 Bathurst Street).
