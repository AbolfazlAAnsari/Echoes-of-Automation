This Opinion piece explains the reality I’ve been living as a physician in America, and — quite simply put — is the single most important health care journalism story I have ever seen.Thank you.Jenifer LightdaleChestnut Hill, Mass.The writer is president of the North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition.Elect the U.S. Attorney GeneralTo the Editor:Re “Jack Smith and Robert Hur Are the Latest Examples of a Failed Institution,” by Jack Goldsmith (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, March 12):Mr. Goldsmith is correct about all the problems in the proliferation of special counsels. His solution is the elimination of special counsels. That, however, does not address the underlying problem: that the attorney general of the United States is a political appointee, and therefore there is an inherent conflict of interest any time a potential prosecution has any political implications.It is time for the country to follow the example ofthe majority of statesand have an elected — and therefore independent — attorney general.Such a change would, of course, require an amendment to the Constitution, but unlike partisan proposals for amendments such as repeal of the Second Amendment or life beginning at conception, an amendment to elect the attorney general should have the support of both parties.Republicans claim that the Justice Department has been weaponized against the Jan. 6 defendants and against Donald Trump. Democrats fear that a second Trump administration will weaponize the Justice Department.Electing the attorney general would not guarantee impartiality — any elected official is political — but it would mean that attorneys general would be independent of the president, who could no longer fire them. It might even help to reduce the heat of current political discourse.James FogelBronxThe writer is a former assistant district attorney and a retired New York City Criminal Court judge.Friendship MemoriesTo the Editor:Re “The Friends Who Got Away,” by Frank Bruni (Opinion, March 16):I loved Mr. Bruni’s essay about the sadness of seeing good friends drift away. I could strongly relate, having moved from place to place for my entire life.It’s easy to be overwhelmed by yearning for old friendships, but in recent years I have started looking at it with a new perspective: It’s natural for friends to drift apart because of changing circumstances. Rather than be sad, I simply feel lucky that all of these wonderful people were a part of my life, however briefly.I have some beautiful memories to sift through when I am feeling nostalgic, and I hope that my old friends also think of me from time to time with a smile.Nancy MatsunagaCroton-on-Hudson, N.Y.A Leadership GapTo the Editor:“Surviving the Ugliness of It All,” by David Brooks (column, March 8), is a very good analysis of America today. Unfortunately, our current political leaders do not deserve to be even discussed in the same breath as Lincoln, Roosevelt or Churchill.It is so very sad that in this nation of more than 330 million we have such a poor choice of candidates for president.Charles ToubinAustin, TexasThis article appeared in print on page A23."
