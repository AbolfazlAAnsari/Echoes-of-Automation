And with Trump unwilling or unable to broaden his base, Biden is well-positioned to build on his suburban margins.Suburbanites have supported Biden for every office he's held, from a county councilman to commander-in-chief. A daily commuter betweenDelaware and Washington, DC, during his 36 years in the Senate, people like his New Castle neighbors and fellow Amtrak passengers shaped his political sensibilities and enhanced his centrist appeal.In 2008,Barack Obamachose \"Amtrak Joe\" as his running mate as much for Biden's moderate image as his experience in Congress. And in 2020, Biden was able to push aside and then unite progressive opponents behind acentrist candidacythat resonated with swing voters, making Trump seem all the more extreme.Four years after Hillary Clinton lost thesuburbs, Biden trumped Trump bytwo percentage pointsamong suburban voters, driven especially bysuburban womenwho, askey advisorswarned Trump, found rhetoricon the suburbs, and his positions on issues they cared about, unpalatable.Of course, recreating his urban-suburban coalition isn't going to be easy for Biden, given the blame he's received for a bipartisanimmigration mess, the intraparty feuding over theIsrael-Hamas war, the leakage of previously loyalLatino votersanddenial that the economy is soaring.Biden's strength in the suburbs isn't only his track record there. His party's recent performance on issues - abortion only the most obvious - has animated suburbanites up and down the ballot.Last year, suburbanites embraced Democratic politicians and positions in state and local contests. Voters in Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and even deep \"red\" Kentucky rebuked Republicans, who pushed positions that moderate, independent (and even some Republican leaning) suburbanites saw as extremist. Abortion garnered the most headlines, assuburban womenespecially came out in droves for \"pro-choice\" plebiscites and politicians. Last month, DemocratThomas Suozziwon a special election to recapture a Long Island congressional seat, following former GOP Rep. George Santos' expulsion.Inflation, a key concern in polling, didn't stick to suburban Democrats as much as they had feared and Republicans hoped; their candidates repeatedly turned back Republicans who campaigned on that issue.On immigration, another issue on which Biden and other Democrats poll poorly, Trump's and other Republicans' refusal to embrace a bipartisansolutionenabled Suozzi to refocus the issue as one of GOP intransigence and partisanship.Like Suozzi, Biden and other Democrats are taking a tougher stance on border security, while pounding Republicans for being more interested in scoring political points than solving problems.Suburban Democratsalso have experienced less fallout on the issue because migrants aren't nearly as prevalent in their districts as they are in many cities.Biden and the suburbs have enjoyed a symbiotic relationship for decades. If hisnew momentumin the polls is to be sustained through November, it will be suburbanites who step up to save one of their own.Opinion by Lawrence LevyTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
