Never argue with the police. Keep your hands visible. The deaths ofSandra BlandandBreonna Taylorwere tragic opportunities to remind us that like Black men, Black women may not be safe at the hands of some police officers, whether they encounter them during a traffic stop or while sleeping in their own homes. I make a mental note to tell her however that driving while Black can be dangerous, even if you're fortunate enough not to be stopped by police.In the aftermath of thetragic shooting this past April of Ralph Yarl, parents of Black children like me came to be more aware than ever about the limitations of \"The Talk.\"We can warn our children to be mindful about the neighborhoods they walk in, but there is nothing that a 16-year-old kid could have done to prepare or protect himself from the danger that lay on the other side of a White man's front door. That young man simply rang the wrong doorbell.My Black daughters shouldn't have to feel like they're responsible for everyone else around them. Yet, after my oldest and her friend were the targets of a racist rant on a train, they were grateful that an older Black passenger intervened while others who were White stood by.Black women are often expected to raise their voices andpick up cell phonesto protect family, friends and even strangers. So when I speak to my daughters, I will explain that out in the world, Black people sometimes carry the burden of protecting themselves and anyone else who is Black.I expect my daughters to be strong, young women who are unafraid to stand up for their ideas in the classroom. Yet when one of them tells me about an argument with a counselor, I feel the need to explain to them that Black girls can bebody slammed to the groundinside a school or evenpulled from the classroomin handcuffs, simply for strongly disagreeing with a teacher.In my mind, I wonder if there's still time to warn her that White girls are often admired and celebrated for being outspoken or assertive, while Black girls risk unfair punishment.I hope my daughters are treated just as respectfully as their White girlfriends when they go shopping. The dangers ofshopping while Blackare well documented; Black women are accustomed to being racially profiled by retail workers who follow them in stores. But a growing threat to Black women these days are their fellow shoppers.TikTok has served up examplesof White Karens or Kens falsely accusing Black women of stealing or assault. The next time I go shopping with my youngest, I vow to tell her to watch others as closely as they may be watching you. And I will instruct her to keep her receipts, even though a paper receipt might not be enough to prove she's a good customer.As we've seen far too frequently, in case of a dispute, Black customers often needcell phone videoto prove their side of a story.I believe my daughters have the right to have their physical boundaries and racial identities respected. But when even acelebrity is caught openly braggingabout his alleged mistreatment of Black women, it's hard for me to hold my tongue about what I understand about the world today.And when my 18-year-old daughter rolls her eyes and laughs off someone who catcalls her in public, I wonder how to share this lesson: Be sure a man loves you for your Blackness, but doesn't fetishize it.But while I worry that my daughters and other young Black women face unique risks because of their race and their gender, I'm not always sure that I'm the best person to deliver these messages. Part of the reason is that although I'm a Black man, I'm mixed-race and white appearing. And unlike my siblings who are darker skinned, I had no experience with \"The Talk.\" And yet, I'm the parent my daughters have got - light-skinned and male, though I may be. It falls to me, as best I can, to deliver these messages that could help them avoid future hurt or heartache.Even as I share with my daughters the truth about the challenges they will face, I know in my heart that my beautiful daughters deserve to live in a world where parents don't need to warn their children about the dangers of living while Black.Until that day comes, we'll need to talk.Opinion by Steve MajorsTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
