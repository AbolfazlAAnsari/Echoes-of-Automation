By Zero's own data, its gender pay gap sits at 11 per cent.Of course, while we've mainly concerned ourselves with the substance of gender equity, that's not to say everyone nailed the marketing either.In a post that took the (purple iced, \"IWD2023\" emblazoned) cake, domestic venture capital outfit OneVentures shared photos of nine of its male \"allies\". \"As we're profiling women for the rest of the week, we wanted to create some balance and recognise the men on our team too,\" it explained.A mea culpa and \"unreserved apology\" swiftly followed.Dabble signs upBrownlow provocateurIn the race to be the most risque online betting outfit, surely Tabcorp-backed social betting outfit Dabble is giving sector gorilla Sportsbet a run for its money.Lately, Sportsbet has been fined for breaching gambling advertising laws, spammed customers who tried to unsubscribe, and had several ads pulled off air.Upstart Dabble, meanwhile, has taken to spruiking its promotions to the followers of social media pages seemingly devoted to men's mental health. This digital equivalent of selling beer outside an Alcoholics Anonymous function is all kosher, Dabble has argued, because its investigations found Facebook page Blokes Advice wasn't explicitly a support group.Dabble taking the fight to the online bookmaking titan grew more explicit this week, when it signed up one of Sportsbet's edgiest celebrity endorsers.For the past five years, former Collingwood star Dane Swan has been the social media voice of Sportsbet's Brownlow coverage, in which guise he's run recurrent gags about after-parties at strip clubs, poked fun at vegans and the gender-nonconforming, made (barely) veiled references to cocaine use, and knowing winks about Sportsbet's responsible gambling reminders.Last year's awards also featured plenty of banter about the stuff Sportsbet wouldn't let him tweet on the night. At least, it seems, he won't have to worry about that again, having on Tuesday announced his new job with Sportsbet competitor Dabble.As well as 20 per cent owner Tabcorp and founders Jonathan Robin and David Robin (no relation to the author), Dabble is partly owned by fellow ex-Collingwood player Heath Shaw, whose 300th game in 2019 was noted by Swan on Instagram through a potted history of scandals to attach to the player. \"You've lied, drunk drove ... and drank a lot all the way to 300. Keep it going, because your money runs out when you stop playing.\"Though, clearly, there's plenty of other work for the AFL's most in-character lads.Swan's new employment comes ahead of Sportsbet's appearance next month at a parliamentary inquiry into the societal damage caused by online betting, where it will try to convince parliamentarians that it's as responsible a bookmaker as its submissions make it out to be.If anyone were to ask Sportsbet to explain Swan's spiciest tweets, at least it can honestly say he's not on the books now.Chalmers donates extrafee to super sectorLoath as we are to wade into the super wars, Treasurer Jim Chalmers could do with some free general advice. Namely, to consolidate his super.Parliamentary disclosure documents reveal that Chalmers still has two super accounts, with both AustralianSuper and the Australian Retirement Trust counting him among their membership.It's a surprising move from the country's chief financial officer who, fresh from two weeks of campaigning on how the country should view its retirement savings, is surely aware of the economic benefits of paying a single set of management fees as opposed to two.Last term, the former Coalition government legislated to \"staple\" workers to a single fund. To benefit workers in retirement, Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones is now reviewing how to stop companies dodging their stapling obligations.But Chalmers is not alone in Canberra in needing a lesson in consolidation. The parliamentary standing committee on economics, for one, has interests in far more super funds than it has members.Labor MP Sam Rae and Liberal Bert van Manen have two each, while teal Allegra Spender and Liberals Keith Wolahan and Garth Hamilton each have three.In \"the other place\", the Senate Standing Committee on Economics member Matt Canavan also has three super accounts.At least, with so many superannuation fees paid between them, Australia's economic brains trust knows well how most of us struggle with life's admin tasks.AustralianSuper and the ART are the two biggest funds, and consistently rank as two of the best performers, so we can see why Chalmers may have struggled to commit.Perhaps his indecision could be remedied by considering which most wholeheartedly supports his ambitious plans for the sector to pour some of its $3.4 trillion funds under management into nation-building initiatives.The ART enthusiastically backs the proposal. AustralianSuper, in contrast, has been one of the most reticent of industry funds to get on board.On another note, those afraid that industry super is pulling the strings in Canberra may find comfort in the superannuation choices of Chalmers' wife, Laura Anderson. She invests with Russell Investments' super product, so the returns of a retail fund will at least be partially contributing to the Treasurer's retirement."
