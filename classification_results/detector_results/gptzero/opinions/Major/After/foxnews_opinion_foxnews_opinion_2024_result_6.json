If reparations are enacted, an estimated 1.84 million people will leave California over five years.Can Californians really afford to pay significantly more in taxes? When debating questions of fairness, is it fair to ask hard-working immigrants and others struggling to make ends meet to pay a more than 50% higher tax burden?If numbers rule the universe, the answer to both questions is no.There is a better way that will create prosperity and improve affordability not just for Black families but for all California families struggling. These include repealing AB 5, which denies work opportunities in the gig economy, implementing school choice to improve education outcomes and break students out of failing public schools, and reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and local zoning regulations to lower the cost of housing.These policies will expand opportunities and incomes, particularly for lower-income households. Incentivizing broad-based prosperity is thebest way to help Black Californians— and all Californians — climb the economic ladder and obtain the American Dream.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM WAYNE WINEGARDENDr. Wayne Winegarden is a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute.
