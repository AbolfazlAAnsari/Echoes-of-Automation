Canada's federal rate has remained unchanged since 2012, while France, Sweden, the U.S. and others have all reduced their rates and become more tax-competitive.Capital gains tax hike is another fulfillment fiasco in the making(https://financialpost.com/opinion/capital-gains-tax-hike-fulfillment-fiasco-making)Capital gains tax hike proposal should be delayed(https://financialpost.com/personal-finance/taxes/trudeau-capital-gains-changes-delayed-scrapped-moody)A post-budget survey(https://www.marsdd.com/news/budget-capital-gains-changes-are-a-tipping-point-for-canadian-startups-survey/) by regional innovation hubs MaRS Discovery District, Communitech and Invest Ottawa details how Canada's top innovators and tech talent are responding to the hike in capital gains taxes. Forty-five per cent of more than 150 startup leaders who responded say they personally are considering relocating outside the country, 23 per cent say they may move their headquarters outside Canada, 60 per cent say the capital gains tax increase will deter investment and innovation and 21.9 per cent say it will harm job creation and talent recruitment.So, as we all focus on the details, arguing the pros and cons of carve-outs and caveats, our own innovators - and the rest of the world - have yet another reason to look elsewhere for places to invest, build companies, create jobs and provide economic opportunity. Details obviously matter, but the narrative matters more. And our current narrative is one of limiting growth, deterring investment and stifling entrepreneurialism. Not a good story.Financial PostJessica Brandon-Jepp is senior director of fiscal and financial services policy with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. !@COPYRIGHT=Â© 2024 Postmedia Network Inc.
