Only the feds can do that.Â They chose not to, principally because Trumpâ€™s payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels did not qualify as campaign expenditures under the law.Â  In other words, there was no crime committed, regardless of the bookkeeping that occurred ex post facto.Even the liberalNew York Timeshas published several articles casting doubt on Braggâ€™s daffy legal theories.Â  On Tuesday, it ran a blistering column written by Jed Handelsman Shugerman, a distinguished law professor at Boston University entitled, \"I Thought the Bragg Case Against Trump Was a Legal Embarrassment.Â Now I Think Itâ€™s a Historic Mistake.\"I couldnâ€™t agree more.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GREGG JARRETTGregg Jarrett is a Fox News legal analyst and commentator, and formerly worked as a defense attorney and adjunct law professor.
