From the West Coast ports strike this summer, to the St. Lawrence Seaway strike this fall, Canada is building a reputation as an unreliable trading partner. To put it into perspective, a recent Scotiabank report(https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/about/economics/economics-publications/post.other-publications.economic-indicators.scotia-flash.-january-31--2024-.html) stated that Canada is losing more hours worked to striking workers than it lost at any point during pandemic restrictions. And all signs indicate more labour unrest is forthcoming.Although politicians claim to be addressing Canada's productivity challenges, they are advancing anti-replacement worker legislation that will reduce productivity, further erode our global reputation and keep Canada from simply getting things done.The government understands the risks. In fact, its own discussion paper(https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/labour-relations/replacement-workers/discussion-paper.html) on anti-replacement worker legislation stated that the majority of studies on prohibiting replacement workers showed they came with more frequent strikes and lockouts. If that research is correct, the ban could harm the economy by subjecting Canada's federally regulated telecommunications and transportation infrastructure - the trains, planes, trucks and ships that form the sinews of our supply chain - to frequent and lengthy job actions.Replacement workers allow organizations in rail, ports, telecom and air to sustain a basic level of \"lights on\" continuity that preserves critical services for Canadians. These workers, typically non-union employees of an organization facing a work stoppage or contractors with a long-term relationship with the organization, are an essential backstop for our economy, able to step in on a temporary basis - in the interests of Canadians - until a work stoppage ends.There are serious ramifications for all Canadians if we prohibit these workers from keeping those lights on.Outages to our telecommunications infrastructure, which we all count on to be fast and reliable, are often resolved without issue. But during a strike replacement workers would not be able to fix problems. Customers in an affected area could be without even emergency services - including access to 911, be their need ambulance, fire department or police. Local coffee shops or restaurants would lose their ability to process payments, while Canadians wouldn't be able to reach loved ones.Consider as well that Canadians across the country rely on commuter public transit to get to where they're going, including many who rely on rail service to get to and from work each day. Approximately 70 million passengers use rail each year, including along our biggest corridors in the Greater Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver areas.
