During the pandemic, mortgage rates were at their lowest level inhistoryand housing was cheaper. It took just about 20% of the median family income to pay for a mortgage with 20% down. Today, mortgage interest rates are up - the30-year fixed rateis currently 7.63%- and so are home prices. Americans need about35%of their income to pay for a mortgage, which is higher than at the peak of the so-called housing bubble in the early 2000s.Unfortunately for homebuyers, there is almost no hope that we'll return to the affordable housing days of 2020. More concerning, there is little indication that recent trends will reverse or that homebuying will get much more affordable in the near future.The main reason homebuyers are struggling is that the cost of borrowing has gone up for everybody.

Even more important for mortgages are long-term interest rates that recently hit peaks.One of the main reasons for those higher long-term rates is unprecedented levels of federal deficits and debt.

The lack of supply is keeping housing prices elevated.The current situation amounts to a tragedy for new homebuyers. They have few housing options, and the options they do have are at new price peaks and have to be purchased with high-interest mortgages.There is little sign that the driving forces behind these problems will turn around soon. Inflation is still high, so the Fed doesn't want to reduce interest rates or start repurchasing bonds in the next few months, which would drive down rates; the federal government will not get its fiscal house in order in the next few years; and there is little indication that homebuilders are ready to significantly ramp up construction again. The Mortgage Bankers Associationexpectsmortgage rates will start coming down within a year, but it has had to keep revising its expectations for rates upwards.Homebuyers in general should not try to time the market. If we've learned anything in the past two decades, it's that housing prices can go up and down unexpectedly. But for those who don't have to buy right now, renting should be considered an option. Despite claims to the contrary, homebuying is not always a better financial decision than renting. Since rents have started comingdown, a comfortable rental home can be a great alternative when buying is unaffordable.For those who are looking to buy, the best short-term hope is that economic and financial headwinds start to push home prices down again. Lower prices would allow homebuyers to secure high-interest mortgages now and then hope to refinance when or if rates go down again in the future. It might be slim comfort, but it is one of the few things for which potential homebuyers, including this writer, can hope.Opinion by Judge GlockTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
