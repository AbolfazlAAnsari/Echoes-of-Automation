PARENTS SHOULD NOT PAY THEIR ADULT CHILDREN'S BILLSIf I were in your shoes, I’d start trying to think about ways you canserve other peopleor causes you care about. Maybe there were dreams you had a long time ago, and you put them aside for your career. What really speaks to you right now, at this stage of your life? For you, if you have kids in the house, it might mean becoming astay-at-home momand really pouring yourself into them. It might mean starting an animal shelter, or providing meals for people who are homebound. Everyone has dreams, and everyone’s dreams are different.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONIt sounds like you’ve been thinking about this for a while, so here’s my advice to you. Take a day, or even a weekend, all to yourself. Get away from everything and everyone—any and all outside distractions—and think about your future self. Bring along things toeat and drink, a bunch of notepads, pencils and a Bible. Then, before you do anything else, take a deep breath, relax and pray.From that point on,be completely honest with Godand with yourself. Open up your heart and mind to things you care about and all the possibilities. You have to have a goal that’s worthy in mind, and that’s the one thing that’s missing. But a time of thoughtful prayer—and yes, even daydreaming—may just put you closer to an answer than you’ve ever been before.Congratulations on your success, Amanda.
