McConnell was first elected by Kentucky voters in 1984, and McConnell was elected by his colleagues in the Senate Republican Conference to be their leader in 2007. When McConnell voluntarily yields that job in the next Congress, he will have spent a record 18 years as leader of a party in the Senate.Last week McConnell laid out the outline of his last mission as Leader. McConnell may run for re-election in 2026 and if he does he is certain of victory. Whether he does or not, however, his views will not change on the need for the United States to lead the West and to adhere to the national security policy of the first of the seven presidents he has served alongside, Ronald Reagan. It is a view shared by the majority of Republicans according to the annual summer survey on national security issues conducted by the Ronald Reagan Foundation.McConnell used last weekâ€™s NATO summit as the backdrop to a speech he delivered at the Washington D.C. headquarters of The Reagan Institute, a piece of the Reagan Foundationâ€™s overall structure. McConnellâ€™s remarks are a complete defense of Reaganâ€™s \"peace through strength\"foreign policyand a powerful reminder to the GOPâ€™s delegates to the national convention now gathered in Milwaukee about what the last centuryâ€™s most popular Republican president laid down as the central mission of the United States.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\"The West must ensure that our promises and our threats are backed by hard power,\" McConnell stated. \"And,\" he added in the direct language that is supported by a majority of Republicans and American generally, \"nowhere are the Westâ€™s interests and the credibility of its commitments more plainly and immediately at stake than on the front lines of Ukraine.\"Mitch McConnell doesnâ€™t care whom he offends â€”he doesnâ€™t need any more Christmas cards and he doesnâ€™t much care what online masters of their own universes exclaim about him. He never has, whether the snarks are from the carpers on the far corners of American political left or right. They have never held a serious office, elected or appointed, and they are of no consequence to the real enemies of freedom. So McConnell does not care what they think about Ukraineâ€™s war of survival, any more than he cares a bit about the opinions of enemies of Israel or the output of troll farms of Xi Jinpingâ€™s Chinese Communist Party or that of Putinâ€™s bot factories.MCCONNELL TAKES AIM AT â€˜ISOLATIONISTâ€™ COLLEAGUES IN SCATHING D-DAY ESSAYThe very real quartet of criminal regimes allied against the West right now in China, Russia, Iran and North Korea do not intimidate McConnell, so the great pretenders to influence in the virtual world barely register with him if they do at all. His contempt for the illusion of influence is quite as complete as his rejection of the threats from totalitarians abroad. The latter, however, present real threats to the West, as real as those which the now defunct U.S.S.R. presented to Reagan during his presidency.\"[W]hat exactly does a Reagan foreign policy mean in the current moment?\" McConnell asked of an audience of serious folks gathered at the Reagan Instituteâ€™s gathering inside the Beltway. \"What does the call to â€˜peace through strengthâ€™ require of us in the face of revanchist powers, rogue states, and rabid proxies?\"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters after a meeting with fellow Republicans, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, June 4, 2024. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)(AP)\"I would suggest that, first, we ought to focus on the places where peace is threatened the most, and recognize their most urgent needs,\" McConnell continued.\"Our friends on the front lines of authoritarian aggression and terrorist savagery donâ€™t need hand-wringing hesitation or second-guessing. They need the tools to defend themselves, to impose costs on their aggressors, and to negotiate from positions of strength.\"Leader McConnellâ€™s most significant achievement of his record-setting tenure is that he saved the Constitution from its slide into a shape-shifting \"living Constitution\" that could be easily manipulated by transient majorities and populist crazes. McConnell did his most important work when he announced immediately after the untimely death of Justice Antonio Scalia in the middle of February 2013. By announcing that he and his conference would not hold hearings or votes on any nominee sent to them by lane duck President Barack Obama because of the approach of the 2016 election and the precarious balance of the Supreme Court, McConnell chose to trust the people. Some weak-kneed Republicans fretted then over McConnellâ€™s decision when the older and (the) apparently moderate Merrick Garland was nominated by then President Obama despite McConnellâ€™s declaration. Critics within his own party questioned whether McConnell was refusing \"half-a-loaf\" given what they saw as the inevitability of a Hillary Clinton presidency in that late winter of 2016.McConnell held tough in 2016 when the direction of the Supreme Court and thus of the Constitution was on the line, trusting in the American people and his legendary \"Long Game\" (also the title of his memoir, among the best every written by an American legislator, both as to the operation of the upper chamber of the Congress and to the conduct of American politics in the past 40 years.)McConnellâ€™s principled stand contributed to the election of former (and future) President Donald Trump. The three justices Trump nominated and McConnell led the confirmation of: Neil Gorsuch, Bret Kavanuagh and Amy Coney Barrett remade the Court into a properly \"constitutionalist\" one with ambitions only to apply the Constitution as written and amended in its original intent, consistent with the history and tradition at work at the time of ratification or amendment.UNITED STATES - MARCH 21: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., attends a Congressional Gold Medal ceremony to honor World War II veterans of the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133rd Signal Services Company, known as the Ghost Army, in Emancipation Hall on Thursday, March 21, 2024. The veterans honored were Bernie Bluestein, Seymour Nussenbaum, and John Christman.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)The work of those three justices, joined with the efforts of Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas have returned the Court to its original purpose which, again, is to defend the Constitution, as amended, in its original working, as intended by those who ratified it or any of its amendments. It is the \"Roberts Court\" of course, but it could just as fairly be called the McConnell Court.McConnell could have rested on that laurel, for it as significant as any that history can bestow: a defender of a genuine Republic. But he laid out a sort of farewell address as \"Leader McConnell\" in his remarks to the Reagan Institute, just as George Washington did in 1796 when he prepared to leave the presidency. A legislator is not a soldier or an executive, but a legislative leader of McConnellâ€™s stature and endurance will be noted as much by historians as any of the leading citizens of the republics of the past.\"Credibility, capability, and capacity canâ€™t be surged at a momentâ€™s notice,\"McConnell argued. \"They canâ€™t be purchased at the corner store. They must be honed and preserved over time.\"The keystone principles of the West and thus the key pillars of the Reagan Doctrine are still what ought to drive American national security today. McConnell spelled them out: \"Territorial integrity. Sovereignty. Freedom of navigation.\"WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 26: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) arrives to a news conference after a lunch meeting with Senate Republicans U.S. Capitol 26, 2023 in Washington, DC. McConnell froze and stopped talking at the microphones and was escorted back to his office. He later returned to the news conference and answered questions.(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\"These are not just abstract principles,\" McConnell states. \"Theyâ€™re the same core interests that guided President Reaganâ€™s leadership. And theyâ€™re being challenged today all over the world by Russia, China, and Iran.\"\"Isolationists on this side of the Atlantic must face the fact that American leadership is as indispensable today as it was 40 years agoâ€¦ That our credibility is not divisibleâ€¦ And that European security and prosperity is tied inextricably to our own.\"McConnell is not going anywhere except to the Chairmanship ofsome Senate committeefor at least two more years.
