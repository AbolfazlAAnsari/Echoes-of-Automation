Ron DeSantiscontended, a rationale that strucksome Americans, no matter their politics, asreasonable.Yet critics recognized that Florida's restrictive legislation wasn't really intended for only its youngest students. Instead, assome educators and LGBTQ activists contended, it was the opening wedge of a broader assault on LGBTQ rights and public education in the state.In April, that plan became clearer when the Florida State Board of Educationexpanded its banon instruction about sexual orientation and gender identitythrough the 12th grade. The bill sold to Florida voters as a sensible measure to ensure kindergartners wouldn't hear about sex in the classroom would now prevent high school seniors from being able to learn about the psychobiological basis of human sexuality - and possibly also from earning college credit for such coursework.In light of all the talk in Florida - and around the country - that parents should have a greater say over their children's education, it's worth noting that the AP Psychology class apparently has generated little objections in Florida in the past. Quite the opposite. It was thefifth most popularAP course in the state in 2021. For the 2023-2024 school year, about30,000 Florida studentsplanned on taking the class.Given bothAP Psychology's popularityand its uncontroversial reputation in the state, the dust-up over the course exposes thelie of the parental rights discoursein Florida and elsewhere. Some Florida parentshave voiced their angerthat the course may be canceled, just as theyhave protested the banon AP African American studies. Rather than empowering parents, Florida'soverreaching legislationalways seemed to be just a play for power by the state's Republican lawmakers and, especially, a publicity stunt by a small-minded governorwho wants to be the next president.Not that long ago, the lure of Florida forsome Americanswho moved there during theCovid-19 pandemicwas the promise ofopen schools- the chance for children to continue their education without delayed openings, canceled days, endless Zoom sessions and, in most districts, evenmask requirements.Yet withmore Floridaparents feeling frustrated that their kids can't take the courses they want, many may realize that \"open schools\" don't matter much when state officials are so bent on closing the curriculum.Opinion by Neil J.
