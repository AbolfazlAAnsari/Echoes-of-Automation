They allow owners to continue producing various forest products while focusing management on more climate-resilient conditions, ensuring that their lands remain thriving, biodiverse forests forever.Unlike extensive tree planting initiatives, which require decades of careful management to transform into carbon-absorbing forests, a working forest can achieve significant carbon sequestration and climate resilience gains immediately.Given that nearly 60 percent of U.S. forests are privately owned, these easements are a proven tool to ensure that forests remain our “climate friend.”Laurie WayburnSan FranciscoThe writer is co-founder and president of Pacific Forest Trust.Challenging AntisemitismTo the Editor:Re “Want to Fight Antisemitism? Embrace Jewish Traditions,” by Deborah E. Lipstadt (Opinion guest essay, Sept. 15):I learned from my wise father to take pride in, and love, being Jewish, but to never think I was better than any other person or group. In that spirit, I believe that the most meaningful way we can challenge antisemitism is through a genuine, deep commitment to collective liberation for all people.As we explore histories of antisemitism and Jewish experience, we can learn from the ways that the histories of so many communities struggling for justice are deeply interconnected — as are our futures.We cannot understand antisemitism in isolation from other forms of injustice, but rather we need to deepen ways to collectively resist state-sanctioned and other forms of violence and strengthen one another, as so many are doing.We must also understand what antisemitism is not, challenging false allegations of antisemitism toward those supporting justice and freedom for Palestinians. Our commitment to challenging antisemitism, anti-Black racism, anti-Palestinian racism, transphobia, Islamophobia and all forms of injustice are inextricably linked.Donna NevelMiamiThe writer is co-director ofPARCEO, an education and research center that recently created a “Curriculum on Antisemitism From a Framework of Collective Liberation.”Republicans and the MigrantsTo the Editor:Re “Migrant Crisis Divides North, Lifting G.O.P.” (front page, Sept. 9):Republicans have indeed succeeded in making immigration a highly salient and emotional issue even in blue states. By flying and busing undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers to places like Washington, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, some G.O.P. governors have drawn attention to a problem that is national in scope.Tens of thousands more immigrants have made their own way around the country. However loathsome the original political stunt was, it seems to have worked on some level. State and local governments are overwhelmed and rightly call for federal help.But no one should believe for a second that Republicans will help solve the problem. As they have shown over and over for the last 20 years, they would rather have the problem to use as a bludgeon against Democrats than any solution.They will have a thousand reasons and excuses for their unwillingness to address the crisis in a meaningful way. But the bottom line is that the G.O.P. will block any solution. Every time.Peter WhitehouseMount Pleasant, S.C.Shoes-Off HomesTo the Editor:Re “Here to Help: Vanessa Friedman Answers Your Style Questions” (Sept. 18), about visits to shoes-off homes:An easy solution for a host to address guest timidness over shoeless requests is as follows: At Breezy Hill Inn, we ask our guests to take off their shoes/boots, especially in inclement weather, and don slippers that we store in baskets near the front door.On occasion, guests ask if they might go shoeless instead. And in any case, the slipper option is always appreciated.Michelle SidraneFleischmanns, N.Y.The writer is the owner of Breezy Hill Inn.This article appeared in print on page A25."
