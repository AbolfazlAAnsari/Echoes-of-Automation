In 2015, the US women's soccer team became the first group of female athletes to receive a ticker tape parade in New York City following their World Cup victory over Japan -an honor awarded to them againafter their victory over the Netherlands in 2019. Women's transfer fees, albeit still a fraction of the men's, are at anall-time high, and this year's World Cup showdown between Spain and England drewrecord viewing figures. For her 10th birthday this summer, my boyfriend's niece's number one wish was to watch a soccer match.He bought her and half the family (plus me) tickets to the Women's Champions League semifinal second leg for Arsenal vs. Wolfsburg. Even a few years ago, it wouldn't have been worth opening the stadium for the game as the turnout was typically woeful, but on that evening, the60,700-capacity venue was sold out. In the row in front of us, a man sat with his two young sons cheering Arsenal on, a delightful scene that would've been unthinkable when I was a child. The players took checks from the referee on the chin and the temperance on the pitch was mirrored in the stands; there was no abuse thrown at the opposition, no crush as we exited.All of this was undeniably lovely. However, our rose-tinted day out was only possible because the total cost of our tickets came to a little more than $100. For comparison,tickets to an equivalent men's gamewould've set us back closer to $1,000. Men's football may bebecomingmore inclusive and theplayersless loutish, but there's no doubt which sport is the main event.Women's football may have won the hearts of the public to an unprecedented degree in the last few years, but evidently, popularity alone doesn't ensure equal standing in the eyes of those who run the show. Bejar's bizarre demonstration over her son and the RFEF's initialdisgraceful knee-jerk assertionsin his defense have nothing to do with justice, and everything to do with ego. If Rubiales had simply apologized for what he'd done right away, it would still have been wrong, but at the very least, he might have ceded the limelight to the Spanish women's team where it belongs. In digging his heels in, he's revealed the misogynist heart still beating beneath football's skin.Opinion by Holly ThomasTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
