This would provide a longer runway for takeoff intosuccessful sobriety and reintegration.CALIFORNIA STRUGGLING TO GAUGE EFFICACY OF HOMELESS CRISIS SPENDINGIt would also foster a sense of personal and group accountability within the recovery community rather than leaving people to fend for themselves. It would reduce waste by using allocated resources for programs that are more likely to lead to long term success rather than the current \"pay and pray\" system.Our homeless neighbors, especially our nation’s selfless veterans, don’t just need a house. They need help.In San Diego, I wasshocked to see drug dealersoperating openly and working seemingly regular 9-5 shifts. Locals reported at least 45 overdose deaths per month, with bodies unceremoniously removed from the streets where they lived and died.According to them, \"No one cares more than to drop off Narcan so we can save each other’s lives.\" A meaningless handout from a society that doesn’t care to address the underlying and related issues that landed them on those streets in the first place.HOMELESS PEOPLE NEED MORE THAN A HOUSE. THEY NEED SOMETHING MONEY CAN'T BUYNext, I visitedSan Francisco’s Tenderloin districtwith local activist Tom Wolf and found myself again shocked. We walked for many blocks, stepping in feces and dodging syringes as we weaved through hundreds of people in a zombie-like state.Wolf explained that more deaths occur inside transitional housing here than on the streets due to a lack of oversight, accountability and support, thus perpetuating a cycle of death and reallocation of housing. This speaks to the failures of basic transitional housing programs, which seem to be the standard \"solution\" to the homelessness crisis.Itraveled on to Portland, where Measure 110 was recently passed, reducing penalties for drug possession to a mere $100 ticket and making drug use largely legal.A well-known local homeless activist met me and my son as we uneasily parked in a deserted downtown area. We were instructed to be very aware of our surroundings, watching the ground as we walked and not touching anything.GAVIN NEWSOM CALLED 'DELUSIONAL' AFTER TOUTING CALIFORNIA AS NATIONAL MODEL ON FIGHTING HOMELESSNESSHere, we witnessed the consequences of the falsely compassionate policies currently being pushed as supposed \"solutions\" for drugs and homelessness – parts of the city looked like scenes straight out of apocalyptic movies.Thelack of enforcement and accountabilityfor these policies and programs has resulted in public spaces littered with garbage, human waste and drug paraphernalia. Addicts and the homeless sleep in trash, masturbate and defecate in public, verbally and physically assault one another, and openly use drugs.One woman told us that she has an apartment but chooses to sleep on the streets with her friends. She explained, \"I have been on the streets so long, being inside is a lot of responsibility. I know how to keep clean out here, how to brush my teeth, how to make food. I don’t trust myself inside.\"Another explained, \"We have tried these 28-day [housing] programs, they don’t work, why even bother. If I go inside, they will throw away my stuff and I have to start again.\"CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONAs I bent to speak with her, anotherwoman began to smoke fentanylright above my head. At the smell, Kevin told me to stand up and walk away, insisting, \"You’re going to get too high to walk.\"Almost instantly, my son and I became dizzy and my heart raced. After calming down, I was furious! As a mom, citizen, and woman trying to do some good in the world, I couldn’t believe this is the America we live in now and to which we’ve relegated our homeless veterans.My experiences and conversations on these big city streets highlight the failings of programs that are hyper-focused on transitional housing. Transition without transformation is futile. A house isn’t all that’s needed, thus transitionary housing alone is not the solution.If you value our society,our veteransand our fellow men, I challenge you to vote with your senses, not your emotions.Rather than being woke, be awake to the reality of what these supposedly compassionate programs are doing – or not doing – to solve the unprecedented drug and homelessness crises our nation now faces. We all deserve better.
