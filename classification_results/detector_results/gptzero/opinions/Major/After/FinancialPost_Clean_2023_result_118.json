It's a day when we express gratitude to the spouses, children, parents and partners of our service members, to acknowledge their sacrifices, resilience and unwavering support.A military family's life is characterized by constant change and challenges. Whether it's a sailor's months-long deployment at sea, an Air Force pilot's overseas mission or an Army officer's sudden base relocation, these families endure unique hardships that test their strength and determination.Imagine being an Air Force mom, anxiously waiting for your husband to return from overseas while your son undergoes multiple life-saving operations.
