After court comes into session at 9:30 a.m., Justice Juan Merchan will weigh theprosecution'srequestthat he find Trump in contempt of court and sanction him for 10 alleged violations of thegag orderfor verbally attacking witnesses and even jurors.

To begin with, the gag orderprohibitsTrump from making or directing others to make public statements about witnesses, the prosecution's legal team and staff (other than District Attorney Alvin Bragg), jurors, court staff or the families of court or prosecutorial staff.Among those statements cited by the prosecution isTrump's April 10 Truth Social post referencing Stormy Daniels, to whom he allegedly arranged the payment of hush money, and former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who facilitated those payments. In the post, Trump called them \"two sleaze bags who have, with their lies and misrepresentations, cost our Country dearly!\" The prosecution also cites another Truth Social post, just three days later, in which Trump targeted his former fixer,writing, \"Has disgraced attorney and felon Michael Cohen been prosecuted for LYING?
