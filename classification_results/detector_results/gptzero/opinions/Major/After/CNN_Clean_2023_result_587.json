His primary opponents, meanwhile, are all below 20%, with most in the single digits.Trump hasdenied wrongdoingin all the cases, saying \"the witch hunt continues\" in response to theGeorgia state court indictmenton alleged interference in the 2020 election results. The other state court indictment concerns the business fraud allegations in New York. He also faces two federal cases, one concerning his handling ofclassified documentsafter leaving the White House, and the other about his efforts tooverturn the 2020 election resultsand the events leading up to the January 6 Capitol riot.Trump has so far managed to turn these indictments, which generally lead candidates to at leastrethink their campaigns, into a referendum on the justice system's treatment ofRepublicans versus Democratsand the idea that Democratic prosecutors, including the Justice Department under the current administration, areout to get him.This framing hasforced his closest rivalsfor the Republican nomination tomore or less defend him, while his popularity with the base has made directly challenging him a nonstarter for all but a handful of low-polling candidates.But Trump and his supporters shouldn't take climbing poll numbers as a sign of invincibility, no matter how much conventional wisdom presents these prosecutions as aboost for the former president. Nominating a candidate with so many pending criminal charges would be inherently risky. This is true purely as a practical matter, regardless of what Republicans or anyone else think of the merits of the legal cases against him.For starters, Trump's many legal defenses will beexpensive. Trump's political action committee has alreadyspent tens of millionson legal bills. Money that could be spent trying to defeat President Joe Biden will bediverted toward legal costs, putting astrain on campaign coffers.The indictments have, until now, been helping his fundraising, but if the money cannot be spent on the campaign and instead must be paid to lawyers, the political benefit of this is limited.The multiple cases will also threaten Trump's availability to campaign. He will need to appear in court, with one proposed trial date comingtwo weeks beforethe Iowa caucuses on Jan. 14. He will also need to participate in his legal defense at times when he would otherwise be preparing for debates or out on the campaign trail. One trial alonecould put a damperon his ability to wage an effective national campaign. But four?The indictments may also force the campaign to address topics that are less favorable for Republicans, such as the nature of thehush money paymentsto a porn star andthe legitimacy of the 2020 election.Trump will certainly take the opportunity to talk about atwo-tiered system of justicethat penalizes conservatives, and theweaponizedBiden Justice Department they claim isselectively prosecutingthe president's political opponents. But it's not clear that the broader electorate will be as receptive to these arguments as Republican primary voters.According to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll, most Americans take thecharges against Trump seriouslyand are more likely to view them as warranted than rank-and-file Republicans. Some of the indictmentsearn majority supportin polls. This hasn't had a big impact on Trump'sgeneral election polling yet, but it is much earlier in that race than in the GOP nomination contest.Republicans themselves wouldpreferthe 2024 general election to be areferendum onBiden'sunpopular presidency. Nominating Trump under any set of circumstances complicates that. With criminal charges, it will make it almost impossible to make that the focal point.While most of Trump's primary opponentsfeel constrainedfrom arguing that the indictments show Trump is unfit for office, the Democrats don't. Bidenmay hesitateto talk about them because he won't want to lend unwitting support to Trump's contention that the criminal cases are political, but the incumbent president'ssurrogateswill likely have no such compunctions.And that's just while the cases are being litigated.If convicted, the indictments could also affect Trump'savailability to govern- something that would likely weigh on voters. To avoid any convictions, he needs to pitch the legal equivalent of a shutout in multiple jurisdictions.Paradoxically, the state cases could be an even bigger problem in this area than either of special counsel Jack Smith's. Ifconvicted of a state crime, Trump wouldn't possess even the theoretical ability to pardon himself after the election. If state prosecutions are still ongoing, Trumpcouldn't shut them downby retaking power federally.Though Georgia is run by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, the state is one of only a handful in which the governor doesn't haveunilateral pardon power. That's assuming Kemp would want to pardon Trump in the first place, since the two havefeuded- including over the very2020 election issuesat play in the Fulton County case.A pardon from New York's Democratic governor also looks like a longshot, though manyviewthe hush money case as theweakestof those being brought against Trump.Admittedly, if anyone could run effectively for president while under multiple indictments, it is Trump. He has not only built a healthy lead in the Republican primaries under conditions that would end most campaigns but issurprisingly competitivein the general election,polling betterthan he did in 2020 and most of 2016.Yet, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's prudent for Republicans to attempt this experiment in what otherwise looks like a winnable presidential election. Unless the reality of the political danger these indictments pose soon sets in, Republicans could be sleepwalking toward disaster in 2024.Opinion by W.
