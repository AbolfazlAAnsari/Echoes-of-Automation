The list still goes on.

That’s not uncommon, especially for someone as young as me.Ashley with her husband, Jay and daughter, Sage.(Ashley Papa)I did a little Internet self-diagnosing and chalked it up to not eating the right foods or drinking enough water and carried on with life and our summer plans.But over the next two months, the pain slowly got worse.  I have known my body for 40 years.  I’ve known the pains of cramps, pulled muscles, broken bones, even emergency cesarean sections.This was different.FLORIDA DOCTOR REVEALS HIS OWN CANCER JOURNEY TO HELP OTHERS HANDLE THE EMOTIONS A DIAGNOSIS BRINGSStill, I figured it wasdiet related, but decided to see my doctor and have HER confirm that.  Her first thought also was that the symptoms were probably related to my diet.  But she ordered a CT scan anyway.Now, I often think, if she hadn’t ordered that scan… Because the pain wasn’t that bad, I could’ve just kept on dealing with the symptoms the way I had all summer -- while the cancer continued to spread.After another rare diagnosis and having to undergo emergency lung surgery during pregnancy, Ashley says she pulls a lot of her strength from her daughter, whom she calls her \"angel baby.\"(Ashley Papa)The evening after the CT scan, I got a call from my doctor.  ‘That was really fast,’ I thought seeing her number on my caller ID.  She told me she wanted me to get to a gynecological oncologist as soon as possible.It looks like ovarian cancer.  I was home alone with my daughter at the time.  I went numb.  It was not the call I would’ve ever expected.COLORECTAL CANCER IS NOW LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG YOUNG ADULTS WITH CANCER: NEW REPORTThere was a lot of fear and confusion between my husband and me that night.  We didn’t want to believe it was cancer.  But the next day, I sent my scan toDr. Nicole Saphier, a trusted radiologist, colleague, and Fox News Medical contributor. She came close to confirming the cancer. But what kind was it, really? We were still not sure.There was a mass on the scan, but it was hard to see exactly where it was located.After another rare diagnosis and having to undergo emergency lung surgery during pregnancy, Ashley says she pulls a lot of her strength from her daughter, who she calls her \"angel\" baby.(Ashley Papa)Within three days of that scan, I was in with an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK).  What followed was a month of tests, surgeries, scans and lots and lots of tears, until the official, and rare, diagnosis finally came.Just over two years ago, when I was pregnant with my daughter, I had acomplete lung collapseand ended up needing emergency lung surgery when I was six months pregnant.There are still lots of tears.  I often wonder how one body can produce so many tears.  And there are moments where I want to smash plates, but I know this doesn’t help anything.  I quickly try to pivot and get back to my life.It was then that I had been diagnosed with another very rare lung disease that affects women in the child-bearing years called Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).  I just couldn’t fathom that I would be hit with not one extremely rare disease, but two…and in less than two years!CANCER CAUSES: THESE 10 HIDDEN CARCINOGENS CAN RAISE THE RISK, ACCORDING TO AN ONCOLOGY EXPERTI’ve never had more than the flu in the past four decades.  How is this possible?  You’ve got a better chance at winning the Powerball! This isn’t fair!Maybe this is related to the lung disease, my husband and I questioned and hoped, but it wasn’t.Growing up on the ice and now being able to teach her daughter is what Ashley says brings her so much joy in the midst of treatment.(Ashley Papa)When they asked if I wanted to harvest any eggs before starting chemo, I said no.  I am already so blessed to have a healthy daughter after what I went through then.  Now I wanted to do everything to make sure I will be here for her.  I wanted to get started with the cancer treatment right away.I am now 7 rounds into my chemotherapy with 5 more rounds to go. What comes after, is to be determined. Likely, another surgery.Yes,chemo is brutal. But, so far, I have typically bounced back quickly.
