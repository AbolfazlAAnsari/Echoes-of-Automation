They invented a new form of government by the people and for the people. Each brought different skills and talents to the cause of freedom. Those who followed guided us ably through more than two centuries of often treacherous challenges and grave threats. It is a story best told through thelens of historic documentsthat have been honored and preserved for our national heritage.In this unique collector’s edition, the writings, speeches, and letters of our founders and their successors are carefully selected and explained. The important promises and navigating principles that shaped our great nation can be read in full. Over time, others helped transform public sentiment to advance equality and opportunity, empowering generations that followed. Their eloquent beliefs and convictions are also included.NEW STUDY FINDS AMERICAN HISTORY COLLEGE COURSES AMPLIFY DIVISIVE MOMENTS WHILE IGNORING POSITIVE ACTIONSThe American experiment had its genesis in the power of words and ideas. We owe our unparalleled success to the exemplary statesmen – and women – who expressed them. Bold and transcendent figures defined what it is to be an American and to control our own destinies. Their dynamic opinions, steadfast faith, and inspiring arguments are revisited in this volume as a salute to our nation’s enduring triumph.The durability of our constitutional republic and the rights we enjoy today also serve as a shining testimonial to the moral courage and intellectual brilliance of our forebearers. We are their grateful beneficiaries. Absorbing their wisdom enriches our appreciation for the lives we enjoy and our love of country.Among the essential patriotic documents contained in the book, we revisit seminal moments in the American journey.  For example…*AsPatrick Henrystirred the nation with his passionate vow, \"Give me liberty or give me death,\" it was the inexorable logic and \"common sense\" of Thomas Paine that galvanized Americans to declare their independence when he wrote, \"Resolution is our inherent character, and courage hath never forsaken us.\"*John Adamscautioned that only the ballot box in a representative democracy would prevent men in power from becoming \"ravenous beasts of prey.\" He argued that \"The happiness of society is the end (goal) of government.\"*WhileBen Franklinexpressed sober misgivings aboutthe Constitution,Alexander Hamilton and James Madisonpenned a brilliant set of essays known as The Federalist Papers that led to its adoption.

Anthony, who was indicted for casting a ballot, posed the vexing question, \"Is it a crime for a citizen of the United States to vote?\"*At the dawn of the 20th century,Theodore Rooseveltshattered the Gilded Age of ruthless monopolists and robber barons with his promise of a \"square deal for every man, big or small, rich or poor.\" Drawing from the principles of Lincoln, Roosevelt moved aggressively and successfully against corporate corruption and what he called \"the sinister influence or control of special interests\" in government.Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president of the United States(The Associated Press)*His relative,Franklin Roosevelt, saw the nation through immense suffering in the Great Depression by reassuring Americans, \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\" His innovative fireside chats buoyed the spirits of a nation in despair.
