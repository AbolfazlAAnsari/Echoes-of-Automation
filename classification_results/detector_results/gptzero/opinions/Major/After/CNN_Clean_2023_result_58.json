            "inputText": "In December, a German court made headlines when itconvicteda 97-year-old former Nazi concentration camp secretary for her role in the murder of over 10,000 people during the war. The decision to pursue a crime 77 years after the end of World War II is the latest inGermany's assuranceof its utmost commitment to atoning for the Holocaust.Across theUnited StatesandEurope, the Holocaust is rapidly fading from memory, but Germany is trying to prove that it will never forget. In addition to prosecuting Nazis, the country has been a leader inensuring Holocaust educationis a core part of the school system. It also hasstringent lawscombating Holocaust denial. And just last week, the German parliamentcommemorated Nazi victimspersecuted for their sexual or gender identity.However, over the past several decades, Germany has been quietly betraying the memory of Holocaust victims by naming streets, schools and medical facilities in honor of Nazi Party members and SS officers -- men who used slave labor from concentration camps, armed the Third Reich and directly enabled the genocide.A country can't claim to fully respect Holocaust remembrance while simultaneously glorifying the people who made the Holocaust possible. And Germany has been long overdue in facing this hypocrisy.Money solves a lot of problems, even -- or perhaps especially -- if one's a war criminal. In 1948, a Nuremberg tribunalconvicted industrial magnate Alfried Kruppof war crimes and crimes against humanity. Krupp's empire not only armed Nazi Germany, but hadaround 100,000 slave laborers, including concentration camp inmates, and afactory at Auschwitz.Krupp ended upserving a total of six yearsbefore his sentence was commuted, and he was given back his seized assets -- much of which was procured off of war and genocide. Before his death in 1967, hebequeathed his fortuneto what became theAlfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation, which commencedpumping millionsinto charitable causes.Unsurprisingly, many of its projects ended up honoring Krupp -- transforming him from a convicted war criminal to visionary philanthropist whose name graces acollege,institute, hospital, nursing home andconcert hall. As well asnumerous university scholarships and endowmentsfinanced by his foundation.Last year, a Jacobs University Bremen spokesperson was refreshingly blunt in telling me the school had received 10 million deutschmarks from Krupp's foundation, \"and with this donation the name 'Alfried Krupp College' has been given.\"But Krupp is hardly an isolated case. Klaus Bahlsenwas a Nazi Party memberwho funded the SS -- the party's military wing responsible for orchestrating the Holocaust. During the war, Bahlsen and his two brothersran a biscuit conglomeratethat had more than 2,150 slaves in a factory in Nazi-occupied Ukraine; additionally, more than 700 mostly Polish and Ukrainian women were forcibly sent to labor for the Bahlsens in Hanover.Bahlsen, like Krupp, established a charity thatpours millionsintopublic works, many of which are named after him and done in partnership with municipal governments. Bahlsen's biography on the Rut and Klaus Bahlsen Foundation's webpagemakes no mentionof his Nazi membership or use of slave labor. (Klaus' wife, Rut Bahlsen -- the foundation's other namesake -- wasn't affiliated with the Nazis as far as it is known).Indeed, the historical whitewashing has been so blatant that, in 2019, the heiress to Bahlsen's fortuneindignantly assertedher family's slaves were treated \"well.\" After international condemnation, sheissued an apology.Sadly, it doesn't stop with Bahlsen either. Friedrich Flick, another magnateconvicted of crimesagainst humanity in Nuremberg, has afoundationand several streets bearing his name. Multiple cities have streets honoring Ferdinand Porsche, Hitler'sfavorite car designerwhose Volkswagen plantmurderedan estimated 350 to 400 infants. (Although Porschewas detainedby the Allies, he was never tried for war crimes. As the US Holocaust Memorial Museumputs it, \"Justice was scant for Volkswagen perpetrators.\")And, in 2015, the city of Coburg named a street forNazi war profiteerMax Brose, who also has aneponymous foundation, despitean outcryfrom Germany's main Jewish organization.Meanwhile, Hamburgcelebrates the NaziKurt Korber, technical director of Dresden Universelle-Werke, which hadup to 3,000 forced laborersduring the war, includingat least 700 female concentration camp inmates. Hamburg, whichhas been lavishedwith money by Korber's foundation, has a school, street andsprawling new centernamed for him.These are just some examples: Germanyis riddledwith places named for other Nazi Party members as well asantisemitic academics, authors, composers and poets whovociferously welcomedAdolf Hitler's rise.How does one defend the indefensible? Mostly by obfuscation and deception.Over the past decade, numerous German cities, including Berlin, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich and Dusseldorf,commissioned panelsto identify problematic place names.Around the same time, some companies and foundations named after Nazis hired historians to dig into their honorees' pasts. Theresultingreportsprovide the illusion of public and private leadership taking steps to confront Germany's Third Reich legacy.Unfortunately, in many of these cases, the place names flagged by the reports remain unchanged and the corporationscontinuememorializingtheir Nazi founders. Indeed, by brazenly publishing these reports, the cities and foundations make it clear they know exactly who they're honoring and have consciously elected to continue doing so.Another benefit of such studies is they deceive the public by presenting something clear-cut -- the glorification of Nazi slavers -- as a nuanced issue worthy of discussion. This creates the false premise there are multiple angles to the story; in other words, the studies allow for the \"both siding\" of Nazis.The inherent absurdity can be striking. Last February, the Krupp foundation -- named for a Nazi convicted of crimes against humanity at Nuremberg --unveiledthe beginning of a study exploring Krupp's \"relationship toward National Socialism.\" Imagine an organization named for Osama bin Laden, another deceased multi-millionaire with a penchant for mass murder, hiring historians to examine bin Laden's relationship toward Islamic terrorism.Or take BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt, whose namesake ran a battery company thatforced concentration camp inmatesto work in such barbaric conditions it killed an average of 80 slaves a month.The history section of the foundation's sitecontains informationabout Quandt's past referencing a report that was done into his personal history. According to the foundation's summary of the findings, \"Many forced laborers fell ill and did not survive these cruel conditions. As personnel manager, Herbert Quandt, who joined the NSDAP [Nazi Party] in 1940, was aware of the conditions in the factories.\" Yet the foundation's mission statementis to promote\"responsible leadership.\"Reporting on Nazi-named foundations invariably leads to the question of what next. Isn't it good that money, much of it made off of war crimes, is being put to benevolent purposes?This is another example of obfuscation, which enables the whitewashing of Nazis. It's predicated upon a false choice: either you let them build charities, schools and streets named after Third Reich figures, or they'll take their money elsewhere.No such choice exists. Several of the foundations in question arelarge entities tiedtobusinesses. They're a part of society and can be influenced just like any other corporation.Indeed, there are examples, bothin Europeandthe US, of public pushback preventing the glorification of slavers without ending the funding. Thiswas the casewith Frankfurt's Goethe University in 2019, when student and faculty protests led to the renaming of a campus lounge that honored a Nazi Party member who used slave labor.Otherwise, insisting we must acquiesce to honoring Nazis -- lest the charities withhold their money -- is tantamount to letting them hold their victims hostage in death as they imprisoned their bodies in life.Today's resurgence of global White supremacyhas broughtus horrific images offar-right groupsin Eastern Europe holding marches to honor local Holocaust perpetrators.Germany's approach is less vulgar yet exponentially more hypocritical. Ittakes schoolchildrenon concentration camp visits and to history museums. Itlecturesother nations aboutHolocaust denial. It goes out of its way to sentence a 97-year-old former Nazi secretary.And it does all this while some of its elite institutions, universities and municipalities thrive on Nazi money in exchange for rehabilitating the images of prominent Third Reich slavers.Opinion by Lev GolinkinTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
