Trump, however, is anything but a conventional Republican candidate. After all, heattempted a coupto remain in power despite losing the 2020 election for which he now facesnumerous felonycharges.Trump's deep-pocketed andhighly credentialed donors, including Paulson, doubtless are fully aware of his record, but nevertheless see fit to donate massive sums of money to a man who attempted to destroy the peaceful transfer of power that stands at the heart of our democracy.Paulson and the other wealthy donors who attended Saturday night's event must surely be aware that Trump sat idly by, watching on television as the January 6 attacks unfolded -ignoringrequests that he call off his supporters for more than three hours and even turning a deaf ear to his aides andone of his family members.They may also know that since leaving the White House, Trump has celebrated the January 6 attackers, even starting many of his campaign rallies by playing arecordingsung by the \"J6 Prison Choir.\" They might have heard that he has vowed topardonthose convicted ofcrimes related to the siegeof the Capitol, which in some cases included assaulting police officers.The effort to upend our democracy also involved violent groups like the right-wing, extremistProud Boys, the leader of which has been convicted of seditious conspiracy in connection with his role in seeking to interfere with the peaceful handover of power on January 6.None of that seems to have troubled these rich people - at least not enough to get them to forgo making massive donations to Trump's presidential campaign. Their fundraiser came a little over a week after Democrats, including former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, held astar-studded fundraising eventfor incumbent President Joe Biden that raked in some $25 million.If they've been paying attention, the wealthy donors at Saturday night's fundraiser for Trump - whoincludedhedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, oil tycoon Harold Hamm and casino mogul Steve Wynn - might also be aware that in December, the Colorado Supreme Courtruledthat Trump had been \"engaged in an insurrection.\" And even though the US Supreme Court ultimatelydeterminedthat Trump could remain on the 2024 ballot in Colorado, it did not overrule the state's high court on the issue of Trump having taken part in an \"insurrection.\"Trump's donors might even have heard reports about the former presidentchannelingAdolf Hitler by declaring that immigrants are \"poisoning the blood\" of our nation, his vow to be a\"dictator\" on the first dayof his presidency and hisrepeated praiseof autocrats. Presumably, if they found any of this alarming, they would not have donated at least a quarter of a million dollars per person to help Trump take back the White House.To put it bluntly, I don't put the sophisticated, ultra-wealthy people who attended this weekend's campaign fundraiser in the same category as average Americans who have been conned time and again by Trump'srepeated liesthat the 2020 election was \"rigged.\" I suspect that this elite group of backers knows exactly what is going on with the former president.It seems more than plausible that Paulson had at least some second thoughts about Trump in 2024. In fact, earlier in the 2024 campaign, Paulson raised funds for Trump's GOP primary opponentRon DeSantisdespite having madebig donationsto Trump in2016and 2020.But all of that changed once it became clear that Trump would become the GOP's presidential nominee. A few weeks ago, PaulsontoldCNN, during a discussion ahead of Saturday's fundraiser, that he was \"pleased to support President Trump in his re-election efforts.\" He added, \"His policies on the economy, energy, immigration and foreign policy will be very beneficial for the country.\"Paulson left out any mention of the Trump tax cut enacted in 2017, which greatlyhelpedthe very wealthy set, which Paulson and the others at Saturday's dinner are privileged to be part of.Is that why these very rich people are now turning a blind eye to the threat that Trump poses to the rule of law in our country? Are they hoping he'll enact more policies that could fatten their wallets? Perhaps they have fully grasped the danger Trump poses to our republic, but have decided they are on board with him all the same.Or perhaps they believe they can benefit as wealthy friends of an autocratic leader. After all, in Hungary led by Trump's ally Viktor Orban, hisinner circlehas profited under his leadership with the funneling of contracts. Of course, the same can be said of Russia underVladimir Putin, where the oligarchs who gave him their support became even wealthier - until running afoul of him, when some were \"forced into exile ordied in suspicious circumstances.\"A short time after the January 6 attack, Chuck Collins, director of theProject on Inequality and the Common Goodat the Institute for Policy Studies,was unstinting in his criticismof Trump's uber-wealthy backers. \"They enabled Donald Trump. They bankrolled his campaigns,\" he told the progressive news siteCommon Dreams. \"And they cheered as Trump cut their taxes, swept away regulations that pinched their profits, and packed the courts with judges eager to wink at their transgressions.\"Liz Cheney - the conservative former US Representative from Wyoming and onetime Republican member of the House GOP leadership -warnedAmericans recently that with Trump's second rise to power we are \"sleepwalking into dictatorship.\" If he in fact regains power, we can blame, among others, these short-sighted, wealthy enablers who helped underwrite Trump's campaign. They undoubtedly know better, but appear to care more about helping their bottom line than protecting our democracy.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
