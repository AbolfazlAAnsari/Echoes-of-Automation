The real truth tellers ofEllsberg,ManningandSnowdenwere prosecuted by their own government for revealing actual U.S. government misconduct. (Tammmanaged to escapeactual prosecution but was censured and almost lost his law license as a result of his whistleblowing.)In contrast, Teixeira is rightly being prosecuted for leaks of battlefield intelligence gleaned from critical and perishable sources, leaks that his young friends and fellow videogame aficionados said weredesigned to impresstheir shared Discord group as much as inform them. The consequences of his childish alleged act may well cost many Ukrainians their lives.As The New York Timesnoted, \"The [Russian] military apparatus is so deeply compromised, the documents suggest, that American intelligence has been able to obtain daily real-time warnings on the timing of Moscow's strikes and even its specific targets.\"Teixiera's alleged actions all but ensure those sources will dry up, degrading the ability of the U.S. to offer such warnings to protect Ukraine in advance of attacks and increasing the likelihood that Ukrainian soldiers and civilians will die as a result. In contrast and to this very day, U.S. officials can point tono actual deathsof any individual from Manning's disclosures despite their warnings to the contrary.The claims by the likes of Greene and Carlson that Teixeira is an actual whistleblower or a speaker of truth to power loathed by theWashington establishmentare as silly as they are pernicious. Such falsehoods and bogus claims diminish the real good done by true federal whistleblowers.Opinion by Patrick G. EddingtonTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
