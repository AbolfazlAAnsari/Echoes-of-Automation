Sarah Huckabee Sanders has led a statewide reform effort that is designed to strengthen the educational system.(Al Drago/Pool Photo via AP, File)Arkansas is shifting the focus when it comes to early childhood education. We know the long-term value that early childhood education can have in a student’s academic success, and parents who want that option for their child should have it. But it’s no longer just about access, it’s also about quality.With LEARNS, local captains across the state are building regional plans to address access in every corner of our state, and we are raising the bar on what is expected of these providers to ensure that every child has access to a quality education.We’re respecting parents’ right to protect their kids from inappropriate topics by banning left-wing political indoctrination and keeping obscene material away from young children.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONArkansas has also expanded quality K-12 education options for families, whether it be public, private, parochial or homeschool. Before, a family's income determined their ability to choose the best school for their child.Now, we’ve eliminated a long-standing cap on charter schools and more than 5,000 families have already enrolled in a school of their choice through our  Education Freedom Accounts (EFA). Half of those students enrolled in the EFA program have a learning disability.\"The EFA program allowed us to utilize a smaller environment where our daughter gets the help she needs,\" said Heather Bline, who  used the EFA program to enroll her adopted daughter with a learning disability in a private school. \"There’s so much that we can’t control about our lives and our children’s lives. Having the freedom to choose where you want your child to attend school makes a huge difference.\"And all of this is just one year into implementation. There’s more to come, and Arkansas will continue to translate policy into practice in collaboration with educators, parents, administrators, and stakeholders across the state.We aren’t talking about what should be done for kids; we’re doing the work. As a result, we are one step closer to ensuring every Arkansas child has access to a quality education, a good-paying job, and a better life — right here,  in Arkansas.
