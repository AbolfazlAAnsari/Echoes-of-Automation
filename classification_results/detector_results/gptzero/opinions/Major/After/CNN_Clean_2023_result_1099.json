It's bounced around for decades in the veterans community and recently in the media from civilian voicesincluding Harvard history professor Jill Lepore. But it's never been pushed forward by veterans' organizations, by veterans in Congress or by the president.Now, we just need President Joe Biden (himselfa Blue Star Dad) or a brave member of Congress - perhaps a fellow veteran - to create and lead passage of legislation to forever change history. And it would give every member of Congress an opportunity to vote with our veterans-and to strengthen our democracy.There were97 veterans elected to the 118th Congress in 2022, representing 36 states. While comprising a smaller contingency than in previous years, they are a diverse and inspiring group of leaders from both parties that I have called \"The Camouflage Wave.\" Now is the time for one member to write the legislation, identify co-sponsors, name the bill-perhaps after a World War II veteran like President George H. W. Bush-rally the support of the American people, drive media attention, and get it done by Veterans Day 2024.It's a simple, achievable, affordable, unifying and bi-partisan goal for Congress, one that can create historic change, truly support our veterans, and improve our democracy in a time when we need it most.Opinion by Paul RieckhoffTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
