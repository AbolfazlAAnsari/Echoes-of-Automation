Under theleadership of Vladimir Lenin, at least five million people were starved to death and within 10 years, his successor Josef Stalin starved six million more.Ronald Wilson Reagan, 40th president of the United States (1981-1989) and 33rd governor of California (1967-1975)(Photo12/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Anyone who disagreed with Soviet policy was packed off to the Siberian gulags or shot. So much misery, so much fear, so much bloodshed.JON VOIGHT SAYS TRUMP IS THE ‘ONLY MAN WHO CAN SAVE THIS NATION’ IN ANTI-LEFT VIDEO MESSAGEWhen I visited Russia in 1991 to make a film, things were beginning to change. For the first time, an American film production was allowed to work in Moscow, and we had a first-hand look at the residue of the communist system.Walking in Red Square, the first thing I noticed was that everyone walked with their eyes down and kept to themselves, trying their best to be inconspicuous. At the international hotel (one of their best at that time), nothing worked! When I went down to get a light bulb, the girl at the desk avoided eye contact and pretended not to understand English.The department stores were bare and deserted and my interpreter, Olga, a distinguished, kindly woman who taught English expressed her sadness at the way things were in her country. My response was typically American: \"Don’t worry. Things will get better.\" \"No, Jon,\" she said, \"things will never change for us!\" The despair of this lovely suffering soul saddened me deeply and I only wished I could do something to bring her some hope and cheer.RONALD REAGAN WON THE COLD WAR WITH THIS SPEECHA few days later my prayers for Olga were answered with the arrival of an extraordinary woman from the U.S.: my mother. Mom was entering her 80s, had been diagnosed with lung cancer and had an operation that left her partially paralyzed on her left side. She walked with a cane, but she was an indomitable force who never let anything stop her from accomplishing what she needed to do. Not that she was stern. She was loving. But she was a force, and she was fun!Mom was delighted to be with one of her three sons (I was the middle), and since my Dad’s passing I had made an effort to share my most exotic film locations with her. So, I arranged for her tojoin me in Moscowtoward the end of the filming.President Ronald Reagan talks with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.(Dirck Halstead/Getty Images)Mom set a busy agenda and I worked hard to keep up. Olga was completely smitten with her for she had never seen such a self-assured, strong-willed woman in her life. I remember walking down one side of Red Square after a morning of sightseeing and shopping for souvenirs, and my mother pointed her cane to the huge brick wall opposite us.\"What’s in there?\" she asked. \"That’s the Kremlin,\" I told her. \"That’s where the government of the Soviet Union convenes.\" She thought for a moment, and then said: \"I’ll have to go in there, just for the hell of it!\"AS WAR RAGES IN UKRAINE, REAGAN'S HISTORIC MISSION TO RUSSIA HAS LESSONS FOR US TODAYWith that, Olga fell to her knees on the pavement, laughing uncontrollably. She had never heard anything like that in her life, and she was overwhelmed.So, that afternoon, we found ourselves inside those very walls and mom was asking questions and observing the apparatchiks gathering in the courtyard – apparently on a break.Russian politician Boris Yeltsin (1931-2007) in London, April 27, 1990.(Georges De Keerle/Getty Images)\"Who’s that man?\" My mother was pointing to a tall white-haired man who seemed to be getting lots of attention.\"That’s Boris Yeltsin,\" I told her. \"He’s the head of the government.\"\"He seems like a nice fellow; I’m going to go talk to him.\" And she moved off into the crowd.I tried to follow her and was surprised to see that no one interrupted her as she went right up to the big man. I was very concerned that she might be overstepping our welcome. Olga and I eased closer to hear as mom introduced herself to him. Yeltsin was very cordial.I WORKED FOR RONALD REAGAN AND LEARNED THE SECRET OF WHO HE WASThen, she noticed the pin he wore on his lapel.\"What’s that pin? That’s a nice pin.\"\"Oh, that’s my Communist Party pin.\"\"That’s a nice pin, could you give it to me?\"\"Oh no. I can’t. I need it for my work here.\"\"Oh, you can get another one!\" She playfully scolded.He didn’t give her his pin, but Yeltsin was quite taken with her, and the two of them carried on a lengthy conversation with plenty of smiles.Watching this meeting of East and West, Olga was frozen in amazement and delight.
