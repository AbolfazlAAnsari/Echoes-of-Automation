In the Sheppard case, witnesses, prosecutors and defense lawyers made prejudicial out-of-court statements to journalists containing information never admitted as evidence at trial, including Sheppard's refusal to take alie detector test. This inaccurate or inadmissible information appeared in press reports.By limiting the gag order to these groups who operate under the court's authority, the Supreme Court left intact the media's First Amendment right to attend the trial and freely report without judicial oversight while protecting the integrity of the trial.Merchan was aware of the Sheppard opinion justifying his initial gag order,citingit in the ruling. And in the current era, the reach and therefore potential impact of Trump's media presence is gigantic.As such, the threat to both potential witnesses and prospective jurors posed by Trump's social media posts, campaign rally accusations and press conferences is massive and frightening. Trump's platform is enormous: As of January 2023,Trump had more than 87 million followerson Twitter (now called X), 34 million on Facebook and 23 million on Instagram. And he is unrepentant; his extreme rhetoric has continued unabated.The Manhattan district attorney prosecuting this case, AlvinBragg, wrote in a motion seeking the gag order that \"multiple potential witnesses have already expressed grave concerns ... about their own safety and that of their family members should they appear as witnesses against defendant.\" And not just witnesses have cause to fear. When jury selection begins on Monday, don't be surprised if many prospective jurors seek to be excused whether or not they say aloud that they are too afraid to serve (and even though their nameswill not be publicly disclosed).The severity of Trump's alleged misconduct should not be underestimated. A leading lawyers' organization, theAmerican College of Trial Lawyers, wrote that Trump's statements about judges and prosecutors \"puts our very democracy at risk. It should be universally condemned.\"That's why Merchan's gag order is indispensable.Trump has put the justice system under severe strain by his unhinged rants.  Merchan is doing all he can to keep the system from collapsing; let's hope it's enough.Opinion by Michael ConwayTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
