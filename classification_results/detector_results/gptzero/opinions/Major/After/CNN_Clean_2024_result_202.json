Gretchen Whitmer, whose political organizationspearheadedBiden's efforts Tuesday, leaned into the fall matchup in urging voters away from a protest vote on Tuesday.\"Any vote that's not cast for Joe Biden supports a second Trump term,\" shesaidSunday on CNN's State of the Union, recalling that Trump was the author of aMuslim banwhen he was president.That was a preview of things to come. Biden is counting on the specter of Trump to woo young, progressive voters back to the fold. Expect his campaign to strike a sharp contrast with Trump on a range of issues, includingabortion rights,climate changeandstudent loan forgivenessto rebuild this element of his coalition.Tuesday'sRepublican primarylays out a parallel challenge for Trump. Though he captured 68% of the vote, Nikki Haley grabbed almost 27%, or nearly 300,000 votes.Since the state was neutral ground, unlike Haley's home state of South Carolina, and neither candidate had chance to campaign or advertise extensively, it was, perhaps, the purest test of what has become increasingly obvious: Trumphas a problemwith college educated, independent-leaning voters.Haley continues torelish the roleof Cassandra, warning Tuesday that nominating Trump for a third time would be a \"suicide for our country.\"\"We are a ship with a hole in it,\" shesaidin an interview with CNN on Tuesday. Haley says that she remains in the race to offer Republicans a \"life raft.\"There is absolutely no sign that enough Republicans will climb aboard Haley's dinghy to take her where she wants to go this year. Trumpappears poisedto clinch the nomination by the middle of March.Yet her presence in the race continues to underscore Trump's substantial vulnerabilities. By portraying the former president as a legally-freighted, vengeful chaos machine, Haley is articulating concerns shared by voters,particularly in the suburbs, who Trump will need in November.\"They can say Donald Trump won. I give him that,\"Haley saidin her primary night speech in South Carolina.  \"But he, as an incumbent Republican, didn't get 40% of the vote in the primary.\"Haleyhas hintedshe may depart the race after Super Tuesday next week, when 15 states and American Samoa will vote. But she will have exposed Trump's substantial weaknesses, which will have implications for Michigan and beyond.Trump shares a dilemma with Biden. He can ill-afford to lose the votes he is not getting  in the primaries to a third-party candidate or the couch in the fall.His remedy will be to scorch Biden, who is grappling withpersistently lowjob approval ratings, onimmigration, inflation, crime and a pervasive sense that he is simplytoo oldand unenergetic for the job.While Michigan placed Biden and Trump a step closer to the rematch many Americans dread, the primary votes they failed to capture underscored just how co-dependent they are.Each man, weighed down by doubts, is counting on the other to help drive their balky voters home.Opinion by David Axelrod, CNNTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
