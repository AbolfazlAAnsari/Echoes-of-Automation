I understand libertarians claiming such an imposition restricts freedom, for the ban does indeed limit liberty and individual choice, and there’s no getting away from that.However, the fact is thatsmokingis a highly addictive habit that massively decreases one’s life expectancy by making cancers far more likely to materialise. As a consequence, it alsostrains health resources.  In my view, then, it is wholly responsible, fair, and just to create a smoke-free Britain by bringing this policy into fruition.Smoking has killed far too many – often in the most ghastly circumstances – for us to be concerned about a minor infringement on the liberty of future generations to purchase what is, after all, a dangerous drug. The truly significant loss of liberty and freedom comes about not through a smoking ban, but in the form of human addiction to nicotine, for it is that addiction that kills – and there is no freedom in death.Sebastian MonblatLondon"
