I go on to explain:Ben Carson, the former HUD director, has a new book titled, \"The Perilous Fight: Overcoming Our Culture's War on the American Family.\"\"The battle is real. The enemies against us are powerful. To win will take resolve and courage. It will take wisdom and conviction. It will take truth and hard work. It will take all of us, united. But there is no reason that we, the American people, cannot overcome the forces that want to tear us apart — no reason we cannot recognize that there is more that unites us than divides us.\"If we are to be victorious in this pivotal battle, we must first turn to our faith for guidance and grace as we fight to reassert the very values that made us great — just as the generations before us did.Our forefathers also faced seemingly insurmountable challenges, and our American story is a testament to the resilience of brave men and women who turned to God for guidance. Like those patriots who came before us, I too believe that America’s greatest stories are yet to be written — but it is up to us to stand up for our beliefs, restore our traditional values and triumph in this perilous fight.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.
