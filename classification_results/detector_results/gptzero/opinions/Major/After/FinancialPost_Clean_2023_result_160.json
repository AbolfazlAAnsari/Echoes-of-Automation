            "inputText": "By Robert BakerI am a lawyer and 2021 graduate of the University of Toronto Faculty of Law. I am deeply troubled to find the names of my legal colleagues, classmates and professors as signatories to the Open Letter to the Legal Community on Pro-Palestine Speech(https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1LGm4Ug_8gY087lM3nm7O0X1rNPYsxzDlCrdBK0Xl8Z0/mobilebasic). This Open Letter \"reject(s) the notion that it is antisemitic to contextualize the October 7th, 2023 attack.\"Cynically, the authors also warn of a \"chilling effect on freedom of expression and academic freedom,\" which, they assert, \"has the hallmarks of a new McCarthyism.\"My fellow lawyers know that each word has meaning, and even an ostensibly innocuous word can have great power. In this case, the call to \"contextualize\" the atrocities of Oct. 7 is the first step in an argument that - even to some degree - the murder, brutalization and kidnapping of innocent civilians in Israel was justified.If such an argument gains legitimacy in Canadian legal circles, amongst those whose duty it is to champion the rule of law, we risk undermining the protections experienced by each Canadian under our legal system. Moreover, we risk eroding the responsibility each Canadian feels to this country and their fellow citizens.Violence against civilians, whether they are Israeli, Palestinian, Jewish, or Muslim, is undeserving of any justification, let alone by those sworn to strict ethical standards. Even if your sympathies lie with just the Israeli or Palestinian people in this conflict, it should not be debated whether the deliberate murder and brutalization of innocent civilians deserve context.Our humanity should be more than that, especially amongst those who are meant to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all persons - Palestinian or Israeli.Nevertheless, it is not difficult to contextualize horror. Germany lost the First World War in 1918, and was forced by the victorious powers to assume full responsibility for the conflict. Latent antisemitism, not unique to Germany in the 1920s and '30s, coupled with economic disaster and the fear of Bolshevism, catapulted Hitler into power in 1933. From there, it is not difficult to contextualize the Second World War and the Holocaust.FIRST READING: The Canadian lawyers and professors signing petitions to 'contextualize' Hamas terror(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/canadian-lawyers-professors-signing-petitions-to-contextualize-hamas-terror)But so what? Nazism, fascism, mass murder - none of it is excused, not one iota, just because we can provide context. Perhaps instead of contextualizing Oct. 7, we should focus on the crime. Before signing this Open Letter to contextualize the Oct. 7 atrocities, I expect each of my legal colleagues to have studied the video footage from that day, much of it filmed by Hamas. That harrowing footage, I would argue, provides proper context to the murder and brutalization of twelve hundred people.Conversely, if we wish to contextualize Oct. 7 as my legal colleagues demand, let us not hold back. We should also put Jerusalem, Gaza, and the West Bank, 2000, 1973, 1967 and 1948 into proper historical context. If we can justify Oct. 7 because of the Palestinian context, then we can also explain the existence of the state of Israel and its struggle to survive in the context of the Holocaust and the post-war landscape of ruin and displaced persons.If contextualization is so critical, as my legal colleagues argue, then every action of the state of Israel must be placed in the context of the Jewish people securing its existence from the materialized threat of annihilation. I seriously doubt the signatories to the Open Letter would make this argument.Instead, all I ask is that the Israelis, Jews and other people affected by the acts of murder, brutalization and kidnapping committed by Hamas on Oct. 7 be allowed to grieve. I ask that you, the signatories to the Open Letter, refrain from contextualizing and undermining the absolute horror and fear that I, and so many around the world, continue to face. When did the murder of a child become anything less than that?The communities of those affected by Oct. 7 are not signing letters demanding the contextualization of the deaths of Palestinian men, women and children. Those communities understand the scope of this tragedy and, like all good people, want self-determination and freedom for the Palestinian people. Every Israeli, Palestinian, Jew, Arab, Muslim, Christian and other person in the world may each disagree about how exactly this freedom may be achieved and what it will look like, but that does not contextualize or detract from our collective suffering. The pain and death in Israel and Gaza is felt by us all.Let those affected by Oct. 7 grieve this atrocity without having to defend against your demand to contextualize. The murder, brutalization and kidnapping of Israelis, Jews and others on Oct. 7 \"did not happen in a vacuum,\" and you should all be more respectful of our collective history, suffering, and context.Robert Baker is a lawyer and graduate of the University of Toronto Faculty of Law. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
