Some of the funds will goto improvingIT infrastructure and improving customer service responsiveness. A Treasury Department spokesman said last year that most of the net new hireswould be allocatedto customer service specifically.Lastly, the Biden administration has bent over backward to try to sell the new enforcement as only focused on high earners. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellendirectedthe IRS commissioner to ensure the new funding focuses on \"high-end noncompliance\" (translation: tax evasion by the wealthy), and does not increase the rates of audits on households or small businesses making less than $400,000 relative to what they've been historically.That doesn't mean no households making less than $400,000 will get swept up in additional audits; a Congressional Budget Officereport foundthat non-audit activities, such as greater automated screening and document matching, could increase the tax compliance burden facing families under that threshold. But for the most part, the additional activity will focus on those comfortably making above that $400,000 figure.Now, Democrats flubbed a golden opportunity to ensure middle-class families didn't get swept up in higher audit rates. Anamendmentto last year's bill, proposed by Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, would have codified the idea that households making less than $400,000 should be protected from additional audits spurred by the extra funds, rather than relying on a directive from the Treasury secretary that could conceivably be reversed. That limit wasvoted downalong party lines.But while Republicans would never admit it publicly, additional IRS funding could help the agency run more smoothly and fairly. Right now,53% of individual auditsare on taxpayers making less than $50,000 a year, and according to aSyracuse University report,low-income taxpayers get audited at rates five or six times those of the higher earners.The reason is simple -- the IRS' job is to find non-compliance, and \"to expend the least amount of resources to conduct the largest number of examinations,\" in the words of the National Taxpayer Advocate'sannual reportto Congress. This means that low-income taxpayers, who are more likely to be eligible for refundable tax credits and other provisions which can lead to errors, are very likely to be flagged. High-income taxpayers, on the other hand, are more likely to have expert accountants and lawyers on speed dial, making it less cost-effective for the IRS to follow through on possible errors, inadvertent or intentional.This imbalance could be remedied by reducing the rates of audits for low-income people, or by increasing the audits faced by high earners. There are strong reasons to prefer the latter.A tax system in which no one but an unlucky few face the risk of sanction runs the risk of breeding a culture of non-compliance and a sense that the rules are only there for suckers to follow. A fully-staffed IRS, on the other hand, could ensure that taxpayers are treated equally regardless of net worth, and have more customer service representatives there toanswer questionswhen they inevitably arise.A  Republican Party friendly to the working-class shouldn't reflexively oppose more frequent audits of high-income individuals on limited government grounds, and it should recognize that making the IRS a little more user-friendly might improve, rather than negatively impact, those who are forced to interact with it.Taxes are a necessary part of life, just like changing dirty diapers. And taking the easy political route of attacking the people who collect the taxes is an understandable move. But with the big symbolic gesture out of the way, the GOP should quietly letthe exaggerationabout the 87,000 new IRS agents die and move on to fleshing out an agenda that would, as McCarthy suggested, actively work for the American people.Opinion by Patrick T.
