In fact, Chutkan made it clear at the time that she does not \"make charging decisions,\" adding \"I sentence people who have pleaded guilty or have been convicted. The issue of who has or has not been charged is not before me. I don't have any influence on that.\"Chutkan's decision put it in thesimplest possible terms: Her \"statements were made in the course of prior judicial proceedings, did not pertain to Defendant's case, and contained nothing akin to the explicit and often disparaging expressions of opinion\" required to disqualify a federal judge.Given the available facts and the controlling law, the chances of successfully disqualifying Chutkan were all but nonexistent from the outset. Indeed, Trump's lead attorney, the prominent Florida defense lawyerJohn Lauro, initiallybalkedat even bringing the motion, diplomatically saying that he would be \"very careful of those issues and handle them with the utmost delicacy.\"Trump, on the other hand, is famous forseekingtooustjudges he considers biased, which by his definition seems to be pretty much anyone he didn'tnominate(and no doubt includingsomeof those he did). He began agitating for Chutkan's removal almost as soon as she was assigned the case,declaringthat the prosecutor, Smith, had drawn \"the Judge of his 'dreams'\" and denouncing her as she \"(WHO MUST BE RECUSED!).\"It is never easy to say no to a client, and it is presumably almost impossible when the client is Trump. As in every US jurisdiction, the District of Columbia has adoptedRules of Professional Conductthat govern lawyers' interactions with clients, opposing counsel and the courts. Rule 1.2 requires a lawyer to \"abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation,\" and Rule 1.3 further provides that counsel must \"seek the lawful objectives of a client through reasonably available means permitted by law.\"Not every lawyer makes every possible motion, especially when there is no powerful client demanding scorched earth. Smith, for instance, refrained from seeking the recusal of US District Judge Aileen Cannon in Trump's prosecution for concealing documents at Mar-a-Lago, despite her blatantfavoritisminmultiple rulingstoward the former president - she wasrebukedfor them by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals - in an earlier case challenging the government's search warrant. Rightly, she has not responded to those rebukes.Recusal denials are notordinarily appealablein the middle of a case. That probably won't stop Trump from attempting to obtain an emergency review in the Court of Appeals or even the Supreme Court. His chances of succeeding in a higher court are negligible, however, and it is a safe bet that this case will proceed to trial with Judge Tanya Chutkan presiding.Opinion by Steven LubetTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
