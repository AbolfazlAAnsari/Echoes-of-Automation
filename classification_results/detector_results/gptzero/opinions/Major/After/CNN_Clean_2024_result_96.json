He has also successfully sold a narrative about himself.Rather than being a one-term president who cost his party power on Capitol Hill and faces unprecedented legal charges (he denies all wrongdoing), Trump has used the last few months to falsely sell himself to Republican voters as a victim: he is the victim of a stolen election, he is the victim of a president out to get his opponent, he is even a victim of a Republican establishment desperate to bring him down so that they can protect Wall Street and war making.While it doesn't take much research to demonstrate how this entire story doesn't fit the facts, the storyline appears to be setting in for much of the red electorate, to the point it is difficult for Haley to undo. In presidential campaigns, perceptions can set in quickly and become hard to shake. Indeed, though it is not impossible to believe that his confusing Haley and Pelosi was in fact intentional - an effort to confuse voters in suggesting that the very conservative Haley is actually a Democrat in Republican clothing.The odds are low that Haley's attacks will do much to significantly change Trump's narrative.Haley's best bet is that by ramping up the intensity of her attacks, she can remain in the political game. Donors who dislike Trump will keep funding her. Voters in primary states who hate Trump and like her will give her enough of a vote to remain relevant. And then, the biggest question of all is whether an opening for Haley would develop if Trump gets convicted in one of the four criminal cases pending against him and, (as some polls suggest)  suffers a loss of support.Opinion by Julian ZelizerTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
