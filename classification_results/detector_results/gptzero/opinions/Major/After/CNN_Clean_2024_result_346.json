Recent election results and Gallup polling suggest people with nuanced views about abortion haveshifted to the pro-choice side.This wasn'talways the case, and even now, support for legal abortion in every circumstance remains a minority position. In the final three decades of Roe, 1992'sCasey v. Planned Parenthooddecision, in which conservatives on the Supreme Court failed to overturn the 1973 landmark decision,expanded lawmakers' ability to restrict abortion.This period of time saw areduction in abortionsandintermittent gainsfor the pro-life position in polls as the pro-choice side appeared to shed middle-ground voters in debates over late-term abortion procedures and other matters.Trump is trying to restore those political conditions. \"It must be remembered that the Democrats are the radical ones on this position because they support abortion up to and even beyond the ninth month,\" hesaid. (Democrats generally dispute this characterization of their viewpoint.)While Trump has held avariety of abortion stancesover the years andleft some uncertaintyas to where he would come down in this campaign, his current position is consistent with most of what he has said in the lead-up to the primaries, where his main challenger, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley,took a similar line.I agree with the pro-life activists who say this does not go far enough in protecting fetal life and share their sense of urgency. But an incremental approach, coupled with more attempts to persuade a divided public, may be the best path forward under the prevailing political conditions.Trump will deservedly get some benefit of the doubt due to his role in ending Roe. He now has a record from having served a term as president, during which he delivered more results than some Republicans who are regarded as being purer or more sincere in their opposition to abortion.Moreover, if Democrats hold the Senate without filibuster defenders Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, while retaining the White House and capturing the House, they could pass legislationcodifying Roeand arguably push abortion policyfurther to the left.It took nearly 50 years to overturn Roe. A pro-life political culture is unlikely to be built in a single presidential election. But ground can be lost, endangering not just Republican candidates but innocent lives as abortion foes find themselves spread too thin while battling over multiple fronts.Viewed as a starting point rather than the endgame, Trump's compromise has a chance to be good politics for Republicans in this campaign. It could also be a sound strategy for a pro-life movement seeking to capitalize on and prolong the post-Roe moment.This piece was updated to reflect Trump's comments on federal abortion legislation.Opinion by W.
