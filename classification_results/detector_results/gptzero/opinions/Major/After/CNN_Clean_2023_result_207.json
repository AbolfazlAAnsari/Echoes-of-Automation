It was the first time that had happenedsince 1961, when Mao Zedong's co-called Great Leap Forward instead produced famine that killed tens of millions.The 2022 contraction marked the beginning of a long-anticipated phenomenon triggered by China's now-scrapped one-child policy, a policy with potentially calamitous consequences.In addition to shrinking, China's population is growing older. The number of working-age Chinese compared to its number of retirees isdeclining rapidly.In contrast, India's old-age dependency ratio, as the figure is known, isone of the lowestamong major economies. A growingmajority of Indiansare of working, productive age.Because Chinese couples were for decades not allowed to have more than one child, those children will have to bear the burden of keeping the economy going, while also facing overwhelming personal responsibility for their elders.Every child is singly responsible forhelping two parents and four grandparentsas they grow older.That's known as the 4-2-1 inverted pyramid, and its costly duties are one of the reasons why so many Chinese couples decided not to have big families even after the one-child policy waslifted in 2016, replaced withgenerous incentivesto have more children.China's demographic crisis is arrivingfasterthan predicted, with major ramifications not only for the country but for a world that has grown accustomed to surging demand from Chinese markets. China has exploited that economic muscle, which could now weaken.It has used that influence to promote its system of government and, along with Russia, todiscredit democracy, the competing system.Now India is in a position to overtake China's global influence, but it faces major challenges of its own.Today, after decades of breakneck economic growth, China's population is muchwealthier than India's. But India is accelerating, its economy projected by the World Bank to be amongthe fastest growingthis year.Still, India has to create hundreds of millions of jobs for a population that remains largely impoverished. As Chandrasekhar Sripada, a professor of organizational behavior at the Indian School of Business told CNN, \"India is sitting ona time bomb.\" Without more good jobs, social unrest could erupt.Experts say India needs to raise itseducationallevels,keep womenin the workforce and develop its infrastructure.The timing - right now - offers special opportunities.Global investors and world powers are havingsecond thoughtsabout business dealings with China. It turns out that putting your money in countries ruled by dictatorships can create complications.Russia's invasion of Ukraine clarified the issue. WhenRussia threatenedoil and gas supplies to the West, its clients understood the risk. China's support of Russia and its continuingthreats against Taiwan- the world's main producer of advanced microchips - led many countries and firms to reconsider dependence on China.In addition, China's frequent, if usually-temporary,disappearancesof business moguls underscored the fragility of the rule of law and the unpredictability of its business environment.As a result, the trend now is toward near-shoring andfriend-shoring, bringing production to closer, friendlier, countries. It's a golden opportunity for India to emerge as one of the winners from tensions between China and the West.India has long sought to carve a path for itself independent of the main global powers. It was a leading force in the non-aligned movement during the Cold War. Even now, it has declined to side against Russia after it invaded Ukraine, insteadboosting tradewith Moscow by taking advantage of itscut-rate fuelprices.But India should play up the fact that it is a democracy to further leverage its emerging status as the world's biggest country.India's democracy is far from perfect. In recent years, it has been backsliding. Freedom House rates the country \"Partly Free,\" noting the rise in discriminatory policies against Muslims and harassment of journalists and government critics.Still, it is a multiparty democracy. If it continues developing its economy, boosting its standard of living and strengthening its democratic institutions and practices, India could become not just a major world power, but one of the most inspiring and influential ones.Opinion by Frida GhitisTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
