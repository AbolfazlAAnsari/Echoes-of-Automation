Many Republicans (myself included) may have wished for a Republican nominee who would bring less chaos to the Oval Office. But they can also see the potential for conservative policy victories in a second Trump administration. They see the possibility of another opening on the Supreme Court and the scores of executive branch appointees who dictate how law is implemented.As a conservative think tanker who works on family policy, I'd love to see Trump push the \"baby bonus\" idea he alluded to in a 2023 speech. Others, such as Inez Feltscher Stepman of the Independent Women's Forum, are hoping for an agenda that goes afterinstitutions of higher educationthat they see as excessively \"woke,\" or promote the investments indomestic industrial productionchampioned by upstart think tank American Compass.There is, of course, no guarantee a second Trump administration will prioritize many, or any, of these. But despite the uncertainly - and regardless the personal baggage Trump brings to the White House - many conservatives will still object to the direction in which Democrats like Biden want to steer the country.That dynamic wasn't necessarily set in stone from the get-go. A different Biden administration - one that spent its initial years working with Republicans rather than pushing for large expansions of the welfare state or stimulus spending that increased the deficit - may have had a chance at peeling off some of those voters. Successful, bipartisan bills oninfrastructureandsemiconductor chipsshowed a version of that promise.Yet faced with a thin congressional majority, Biden sought to bethe next FDR, passing trillions in spending that was used to advance progressive priorities likeelectric vehicles,social spendingand an ill-fatedattemptat universal pre-K and child care.The administration's progressive cultural stances, likereplacingthe word \"mother\" with \"birthing person\" in federal budget documents, anational tourto support abortion rights and seeking todefund anti-abortion centersthat provide direct services to pregnant moms, limited its ability to appeal to Trump-skeptical cultural conservatives.Perceived chaos on the border, the shambolic withdrawal from Afghanistan and tumult in Ukraine and Gaza all make it less, rather than more, likely any wavering Republican voters will be drawn to the Biden-Harris ticket.This means that 2024 will be a repeat of a film we've already seen before. Biden and Trump threw haymakers of opposition research at each other during the pandemic-affected 2020 election, and the closer-than-expected result took days to officially confirm.Since then, the pandemic has been put in the rearview mirror, the economy has improved, and the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade - all factors that would suggest favorable terrain for a Democratic incumbent. But the lingering aftertaste of high inflation, turmoil abroad and the unavoidable concerns about Biden's age mean that many Democrats will be hoping for 50/50 odds come November.It is extremely unlikely we'll learn anything new about either candidate over the next nine months. The most-committed MAGA supporters will be counting down the days to November 5. Some Democrats, worried about threats to democracy or eager to express their opposition to the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, may also be excited about their chance to stand against Trump. But for many Americans - including a fair chunk of Republicans - the time between Super Tuesday and Election Day will be a period though which they grit their teeth.The results from Super Tuesday, and the unwillingness of either party to change tactics midstream, means the drawn-out slog to Election Day will likely seem unappetizing to all but the most committed partisans.Opinion by Patrick T.
