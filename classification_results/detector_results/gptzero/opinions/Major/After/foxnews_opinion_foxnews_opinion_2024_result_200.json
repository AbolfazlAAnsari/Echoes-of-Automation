It would also limit consumer choices and destroy entire fossil-fuel-related industries, along with the many jobs that they provide.Biden has been staunchly opposed to \"Medicare-for-all\" plans like those supported by Bernie Sanders, but when Harris ran for the Democrat presidential nomination in 2019, she made the socialist policy one of the key parts of her policy agenda.Under the Harris \"Medicare-for-all\" proposal, newborns and uninsured would automatically be enrolled in a government-run health care plan, and those with employer-sponsored insurance would be phased into the plan over 10 years. Eventually, almost everyone would be stuck with government health coverage.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONHarris would allow for a narrow range of private health insurance, but those plans would be supplemental to \"Medicare-for-all,\" tightly regulated, and would be required to \"adhere to strict Medicare requirements on costs and benefits.\"Medicare for All plans like Harris’s would effectively force everyone with quality coverage into an inferior, government-run program. And because Medicare reimbursement rates are much lower than private health insurance, health care providers would need to slash the quality of services provided just to break even.Sooner or later, providers or the government will likely turn to rationing care to manage costs, as they do now in many European nations that have government-run health care systems. That means longer wait times and reduced access to care for most Americans.If Harris has it her way and the Green New Deal becomes law, it would cause taxes and inflation to skyrocket well beyond what most families can afford. It would also limit consumer choices and destroy entire fossil-fuel-related industries, along with the many jobs that they provide.\"Medicare-for-all\" would also be extremely expensive, costing tens of trillions of dollars in new government spending. A study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University found that Bernie Sanders’ \"Medicare-for-all\" plan, which is very similar but not identical to Harris’ version, would cost taxpayers $32 trillion over 10 years. (Most of the major provisions are identical.)Even worse, for millions of taxpayers, the benefits provided would not outweigh the cost of the additional taxes that would likely need to be imposed to pay for the plan.America simply cannot afford Harris’s radical vision for the country. And even if it could, putting the dysfunctional, inefficient, corrupt federal government in charge of virtually every part of our lives, from health care to the kinds of cars we can drive, should be avoided at all costs.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JUSTIN HASKINSJustin Haskins is the director of the Socialism Research Center at The Heartland Institute and a New York Times bestselling author."
