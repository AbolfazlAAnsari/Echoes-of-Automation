But so is not conducting one.Although Surovikin disappeared from public view right after the mutiny, it took the Kremlin two months to make the actualannouncementthat he had been removed. And rather than bring in a loyal outsider, the authorities replaced Surovokin with his own chief of staff, Viktor Afzalov.The effort to discredit Prigozhin got off to a colorful start withpicturesof Prigozhin's opulent St Petersburg mansion broadcast onstate TV. Besides gold bars and millions of dollars worth of cash, the photographs showed a bizarre collection of wigs and otherdisguisesthat seemed better fitted to a \"two-bit criminal\" than to a selfless patriot.But that was it. Any effort to paint Prigozhin as wealthy and corrupt stopped almost immediately, and no new financial investigations were announced. Much of the money and weapons seized from his house by police were even reportedlyreturnedto him, according to the Washington Post, citing an anonymous St. Petersburg businessman.As for unwinding Prigozhin's control over his Africa networks, the warlord was even allowed to mingle with political and media contacts from the Sahel at the Russia-Africa summit in St. Petersburg inJuly.And in what might have been the last straw for Putin, Prigozhin released a video on Monday of himself standing in what looked like an African desert, boasting of his men'sexploits. He claimed to be \"making Africa even freer.\"If the goal was to destroy Prigozhin systematically while taking over his assets, the results look mixed at best. It would not be surprising if many in the Kremlin felt frustrated at the mercenary leader's seeming ability to wriggle free from any constraint. That was the context in which he apparently took his last flight on Wednesday.This article has been updated to include Putin's first public comments on the plane crash.Opinion by Daniel TreismanTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
