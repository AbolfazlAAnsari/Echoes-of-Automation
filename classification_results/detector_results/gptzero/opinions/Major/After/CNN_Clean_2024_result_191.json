Even if his advantage in those four cities was completely erased, Biden would still carry Michigan by more than 100,000 votes.\"Of course, the kind of close election expected in 2024 means every vote matters, and there are other groups that are taking issue with Biden's Gaza policy. But it would be a mistake to think that shifting his policy to the left would be a net gain for him. As pollster Mark Mellman of Democratic Majority for Israel rightly states: \"You'll find there are more people that are likely to vote for Biden because of his pro-Israel stance than to vote against him because of that.\" Beyondmoderates who support Biden's approach, Mellman pointed out that Jewish voters make up about2-3%of the electorate as opposed to Muslims, who account for1%or less.Beyond general ideological orientation, a deeper examination of the views of young people on key issues animating activists shows a lack of alignment with the loudest voices on the left.For example, on energy policy, Millennial and eligible Gen Z voters (covering ages 18-44) support practical all-of-the-above solutions over the elimination of fossil fuels supported by extreme climate activists. By a64% to 36%margin in a poll from theSurvey Center on American Lifeconducted by the American Enterprise Institute, these younger voters favored an approach designed to \"Use a mix of energy sources including oil, coal and natural gas along with renewable energy sources\" over one focused on steps to \"Phase out the use of oil, coal and natural gas completely, relying instead on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power only.\"On immigration, nearly 6 in 10 Americans ages 18 to 29 and 7 in 10 of those ages 30 to 49 say that the large numbers of migrants seeking to enter the US at the Mexican border is either a crisis or a major problem, according to just-releaseddatafrom Pew. Importantly, nearly two-thirds of Black adults and more than three-quarters of Hispanic adults also agree with the severity of the migration challenge on the southern border.Looking at thestrictest policy proposalin this same poll, Democrats overall are slightly more likely to believe that \"increasing deportations of people who are in the country illegally\" will make the situation at the border better rather than worse (30% vs. 28%). Democratic support for more moderate proposalsbacked by Bidenis even higher: Three-quarters of Democrats support a plan to increase the number of immigration judges to speed up action on asylum claims.No matter how you look at it, base partisan voters, particularly Black and Hispanic Democrats and even a sizable number of young people, are much more aligned with Biden's centrist world view than they are with the more extreme policy positions ascendant on the left.With Trump and the right saying things sure to alienate the middle this cycle, the center lane is wide open for Biden to turn his sensible, moderate views on securing the border, advancing American energy independence and supporting Israel into a viable electoral majority. But Biden can only do this if he clearly delineates his differences with the progressive left and continues to defend his moderate perspective with the wider American electorate.The path to reelection for Biden goes through the vital center, not through the noisy left.Opinion by John HalpinTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
