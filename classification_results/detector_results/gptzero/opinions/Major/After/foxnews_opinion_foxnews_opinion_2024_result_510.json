They are assigned an inferiority so intractable that nothing overcomes it, not even good schools and high family incomes.\"What DEI officers around America are guilty of is stigmatizing Blacks so heavily that it is the equivalent of handing down a sentence. Not only do these Blacks have to burn the midnight oil to get into these highly regarded programs, but they also now have to prove themselves over and over — like Sisyphus — against this stigma of inferiority.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONAnd, all because someone wanted a certain skin pigmentation on their campus or at their company. If this isn’t racism, I don’t know what it is.Sadly, there is another aspect to this inferiority — one that affects my neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago. To be born into my neighborhood is to be born into a world of inferiority created by one liberal policy after another since the 1960s. When I see a newborn, a part of me cannot help but think of how that child will grow up conditioned by these policies of dependency, policies created by people who disbelieve in that child’s ability to succeed in life.What they would never give that child is the pathway out of inferiority: a quality education, an emphasis on two-parent households, teaching the value of hard work, discipline, resilience, responsibility, and accountability. What they will do instead is let this child coast through life, never demanding anything, and if that child should have a dream they will make up for that inferiority by relying on racial preference to pave the way.That is why I so strongly believe that inferiority is one of the biggest problems facing Black America. The only way for members of my community to overcome this inferiority is to reject it wholeheartedly. When our people marched for our rights in the 1960s, they claimed they were no different from any race and that they were just as capable.It is time that we stand on our own two feet, sink or swim.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM PASTOR COREY BROOKSPastor Corey Brooks, known as the \"Rooftop Pastor,\" is the founder and Senior Pastor of New Beginnings Church of Chicago and the CEO of Project H.O.O.D.
