Not to worry,Japanese politicianswould sometimes say when in their cups, our American guard dogs will protect us.GOP LAWMAKER RIPS BIDEN'S 'WEAK' FOREIGN POLICY RECORD IN PREVIEW OF RNC SPEECHES: 'GLOBAL LAUGHINGSTOCK'The Europeans, with just a few exceptions – Poland and few of the \"little\" countries – ignored U.S. requests to take defense seriously. They even laughed at President Trump when he warned them of danger – and \"blob\" back home called him an intemperate rube. Ukraine was a wakeup call, but even that doesn’t seem to have been enough.TheD.C. foreign policy crowdclaims anyone who calls for caution when sending U.S. troops overseas or getting involved in someone else’s fight is an \"isolationist\" or an \"America Firster.\" But they and their relatives (and even their friends) almost never serve in the forces.And even worse, the foreign policy Brahmins don’t care much about the deplorables from flyover country who make up most of the U.S. military.The families whose children do serve never get asked what they think. And after 20 years of failure in Iraq and Afghanistan and seemingly open-ended commitments to Ukraine and the Middle East – and a brewing war in East Asia – they’ve got good reason to think the blob maybe isn’t all that smart.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThey’re not isolationists. They’re patriots willing to risk all for the nation.But the lower orders (as the blob sees them) are no longer willing to write a blank check and hand it over to the foreign policy experts.And making them even more leery, they watched the elite class ship industry and jobs overseas, do nothing tostem the flow of deadly drugsinto their communities, while allowing 10 million illegal immigrants into the country – as a source of cheap and replacement labor.So America’s friends around the world, if there is new Trump administration, you know what you need to do. American service members take on a world of responsibilities. If you ask someone from Kansas to be willing to die for you, you’d better be doing all you can to defend yourself first.Themore you do for yourself, the more likely it is you’ll get a fire truck sent your way when the time comes.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GRANT NEWSHAMGrant Newsham is a retired U.S. Marine officer and former U.S. diplomat.
