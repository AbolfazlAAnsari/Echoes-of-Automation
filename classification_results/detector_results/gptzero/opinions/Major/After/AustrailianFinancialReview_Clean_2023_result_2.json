            "inputText": "As a former student of James Allan, I have learnt to respect his opinions while usually disagreeing with them. \"This is a terrible way to change Australia's Constitution\" (January 29) was different. This piece was culturally insensitive and factually inaccurate. It was an unhelpful contribution to the debate about the Voice to parliament, replete with wild assertions and false analogies. As an academic with a long career in public and constitutional law, Professor Allan can, and should, do better.To take one example, he claims: \"This Voice will turn into a de facto third legislative body.\" He is not alone in this mistaken view. He is joined by a line of former Liberal Party leaders and right-wing commentators who have all made similar dog whistles about the dangers of creating a third chamber. I would be more inclined to listen to the views of constitutional law experts.Ask professors George Williams, Anne Twomey, Cheryl Saunders and Gabrielle Appleby. They will all tell you that the Voice will not have legislative powers, veto over legislation or formal powers to participate in the decision-making processes of parliament. It is proposed to be an advisory body.Professor Allan would do better to listen to his colleagues rather than the political right, or read the proposals himself. If he did, he would see very quickly how baseless his assertion is.Jane HallManly, QldBlundering througha cultural minefieldSometimes I wonder whether Alexander Downer is for real or merely Sir Les Patterson in a clean suit. Dismissing the proposal for an Indigenous Voice (\"Indigenous Voice won't close the remote cultural gap\", February 1) he blunders breezily through a cultural minefield, detonating sensitivities with every step. \"The great glory of Australia,\" he advises us, \"is that it is built on the principle that every person is of equal value and that we give no special privileges to people on the basis of their race.\"Unfortunately, Australia was built on quite the opposite principle. At Federation, the Constitution empowered white people. In August 1901, introducing the law that mandated White Australia, Alfred Deakin proposed that \"unity of race is an absolute essential to the unity of Australia\". He hoped the Indigenous people would \"in their last hours ... be able to recognise not just the justice but the generosity of the treatment which the white race, who are dispossessing them and entering into their heritage, are according them\".The Voice, according to Downer, would be the start of a slippery slope. The next step would be \"to negotiate a treaty and set up a truth-telling process\". I guess if your signature achievements as a minister were to invade Iraq and Afghanistan, truth-telling processes may not figure highly on your bucket list.Jon StanfordSandringham, VictoriaDowner's predictionoffers some hopeAlexander Downer's contribution to the Voice debate is nothing if not predictable. In fact, those supporting the Voice referendum should feel more confident of its being passed now that he has predicted its failure. This is the same Downer who confidently predicted Donald Trump would win the 2020 election, that Vladimir Putin would not invade Ukraine and that we should \"expect [Boris] Johnson to remain PM of the UK for some time to come\". It makes one wonder just what it takes to be so confident but so wrong so often on so many issues, and still have his opinion sought - on anything.Ralph McHenryBrighton East, VicThere are many voicesour legislators ignoreWe appear to have reversed the relationship between voters and their elected representatives. It is not for parliamentarians to rule over us while we clammer for an opportunity to be heard by some Voice. It is for parliamentarians to listen to their voters and act to provide what they want.The Australian people love and respect our Indigenous communities and want them to prosper. Voters will not tolerate legislators persistently ignoring them. Simply take a look at the Closing the Gap reports. What a disgrace. Nothing closing there after years of no meaningful action.Parliamentarians should listen to voices in every electorate. We do not need a special body, and we are not going down the path of becoming a race-based society.Kevin John ConnorGreensborough, VicWe can't afford to neglect plastic wasteOne of our \"quiet achievers\" has been the growth of the waste stream of single-use plastics, along with the growth of new single-use plastics from fossil fuels rather than recycled plastics. Tom McIllroy (\"The globe has more single-use plastic waste than ever\", February 6) points out that growth in new plastics is 15 times the rate of growth in recycled plastics. Pressure to reduce fossil fuel use for energy production and even transport is building, but this quiet counterforce is requiring fossil fuels in increasing amounts. Recycling is clearly not working well, and our use is growing.This is not just about the appalling waste pollution. It's an argument for the fossil fuel industry to continue its search for more oil, and it's based on our demand. Single-use plastic should be seen as the costly choice that it is, and be as much a part of the carbon reduction plan as the energy and transport sectors.Carolyn IngvarsonCanterbury, VicCarbon capture doesnot look like a solutionThe Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association contends that it will be \"virtually impossible\" to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 without carbon capture and storage (\"'Let market work' to unlock more gas, industry urges\", February 6). This is likely to be true. To date, however, it is difficult, if not impossible, to find an example of CCS that has delivered the promised carbon storage. The other impossibility, according to the International Energy Agency, is holding warming to 1.5 degrees while still adding new fossil fuel investment to the mix. Unlocking more gas is not compatible with a safe climate future. CCS is APPEA's favourite greenwashing smoke and mirrors.Amy HillerKew, VicSensible approach tosafeguard mechanism Business is concerned about the lack of Coalition support for the government's safeguard mechanism, especially the possible removal of offsetting (\"Business dismay at Coalition retreat\", February 1). But Greens leader Adam Bandt is not totally against \"carbon credit offsets\", which he would accept \"as a last resort\". This is a sensible path forward and parliament should agree.Barbara FraserBurwood, VicMarket-led economydoesn't deliver for allJennifer Westacott provides zero evidence a market-led economy has furnished us \"with almost three decades of uninterrupted economic growth\" (\"Unleash the private sector: Business Council\", February 1). We have had six decades of uninterrupted economic growth excepting 1983, 1991 and 2020. The market-led economy myth also conveniently neglects to mention that CEOs in Australia received pay rises nine times greater than workers in the past year, when already receiving 78 times the pay packet of the average worker. Increasing inequality has never ended well economically.Yet Westacott is worried about tax cuts for these CEOs. According to the Australia Institute, the stage three tax cuts will cost more than $240 billion over 10 years, of which $117.6 billion will go to those earning more than $180,000 a year.Do we want to end up like the world leader in the benefits of lower taxes and a market-led economy, the US, with $20 million CEO pay cheques and worse infrastructure, health, education, and a lower life expectancy?Nick AureliusBondi, NSWWill ABC strike meanradio (and TV) silence?I can't imagine what the ABC staff would be threatening to do (\"More than 1000 ABC staff file for 'circuit breaker' strike action\", February 3).
