In fact, it polarizes voters.Where Is Kamala?–Though she has visited Florida and picked fights with GOP presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis,Kamala Harris has been largely invisiblethrough the first three years of the Biden presidency. Unless she makes a gaffe, she seldom makes news. There is talk of deploying her to help with very specific demographic groups during the campaign, but as of now, we haven’t seen much of her on the trail.WITH BIDEN AS OLDEST US PRESIDENT IN RE-ELECTION BID, HEALTH EXPERTS CALL FOR ‘COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY’Her portfolio is minimal. She is nowhere for solving the immigration and human trafficking crisis. She is also supposedly tackling AI. We are not yet sure she can spell \"AI\" or lead the critical thinking to put necessary guard rails on this emerging technology.Fiddling While Maui Burns–Biden’s inextricable response to the Maui fires from his vacation on the beach of \"No comment\" ricocheted around the nation. Did he really not have anything to say to those desperate people fighting for their lives as he sunned himself on the beach? This was an opportunity for a president to flex his political muscle. Though the administration insists he has taken action, reports on the ground in Maui describe aid being blocked, properties being looted and FEMA being AWOL.Hibernating over Hunter–With real, substantive evidence surfacing that thepresident’s son took paymentsfrom foreign entities in exchange for access to his father, the campaign seems to be locking down.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThe New York Times reported that campaign manager Julie Chavez canceled a planned interview on the Biden-friendly MSNBC \"to avoid facing a litany of questions\" about Hunter Biden. Upon hisreturn from Rehoboth Beach, Biden’s team cordoned off reporters far enough away that Biden could not hear their shouted questions as he turned his back to them.Though this could be a basement-to-beach campaign strategy, it’s more likely that Biden will not run.With few exceptions, we don’t see him on the campaign trail defending his presidency or touting his accomplishments in key battleground states. We don’t see his vice president making the case for him.  He isn’t sharing his vision for the future. He is hiding – hiding from the press,hiding from the scandalsand hiding from his own incompetence as a commander in chief.By the end of this calendar year, I, for one, anticipate he won’t be a candidate in 2024.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JASON CHAFFETZJason Chaffetz is a FOX News (FNC) contributor and the host of theJason In The Housepodcast on FOX News Radio.
