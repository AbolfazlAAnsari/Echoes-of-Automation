Nobody voted for staff shortages in the NHS. Nobody voted for restricting our travel. Nobody voted for 18-hour delays atthe port of Dover.Nobody voted to be fingerprinted when entering another European country (which will happen soon). All these are the consequences of decisions made by this Tory government and not our choices.Instead ofpursuing the soft Brexitthat was the desired outcome of the referendum, the Tories are appeasing their hardliners with isolationist policies that benefit nobody except a tiny minority, and they deserve all the blame they get.Sam BooteNottinghamTrying to blame the idiocy of Brexit is piffleKeith Poole, in his letter, to The Independent manages to hangtravel woes on Brexitas the Easter exodus commences andDover(once again) is converted into the nation’soverspill car park.  Now that we’re “non-EU” it seems we’re required to undergo a minute examination of our individual passports before being permitted into the EU. That seems fair enough and we all knew there was potential for notoriouslyscratchy French border officialsto flex their Gallic muscles. The issue isn’t Brexit, it’s us being disorganised. We’ve had three years to get ournon-EU house in orderand frankly trying to blame the idiocy of Brexit is piffle.Right up until the last hour, EU leaders were trying to persuade us tore-think and remain members of the EUbut since we voted to leave it seems they’re determined to stick to their rights and demand to see passports as they did in our pre-EU world and if, after three years, the ferry operators and border control still haven’t managed to get their ducks in a row I’d suggest it says more about us than the EU officials at Calais.Steve MackinderDenver"
