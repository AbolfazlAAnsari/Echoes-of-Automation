Petty theft is rampant in our cities. Many urban areas have become killing grounds with homicide rates matching active war zones. Violent carjackings are increasingly common. Not even the elderly are safe from attack.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThese are not problems that can be solved by taxing the rich or reforming government spending. Rather, suchcrimes are symptomsof America’s moral decline. \"Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people,\" President John Adams pointed out. \"It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\" How right he was.This highlights why it’s so important that economic research produces accurate results. When we ascribe blame to a boogeyman, like the top 1% gobbling up all the nation’s income, we end up chasing specters. If we can’t correctly identify the source of a problem, how can we ever hope to solve it?Such instances of ransacking retailers — especially for luxury goods — are examples of how the primary problems in American society are social and not economic.And just as research can show us what is or is not a likely cause of a problem, it can also show us what is or is not working to fix that problem. For example, this latest study on the share of income earned by the top 1% illustrates how the tax code has become much more progressive while societal ills have worsened.The top 1%’s share of before-tax income has risen, but not their share of after-tax income. Clearly, \"soaking the rich\" hasn’t helped the poor or reduced the rate of out-of-wedlock births.America would do well to remember that although the discipline of economics can help identify social problems and their causes, it can’t solve them. It will take a moral revival in this country to do that. E.J. ANTONIE. J.
