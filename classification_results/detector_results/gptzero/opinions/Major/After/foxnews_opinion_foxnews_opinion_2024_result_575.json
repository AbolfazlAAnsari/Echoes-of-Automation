For example, Biden’s own FBI Director,Christopher Wray, continues to warn Congress about the dangerous individuals coming across our border. In a recent testimony, Wray said, \"We are seeing a wide array of very dangerous threats that emanate from the border,\" and Wray pointed to drug trafficking in particular. He went on to share his concern about the possibility of an imminent terror attack on U.S. soil, given our lack of screening mechanisms for new entrants.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONEven a group of 15 (and growing)House Democratshave started a petition urging the administration to take action to secure the border, but the Biden administration has ignored their warnings.Conservatives know that we shouldn’t rely on Washington to solve our problems, even if it is their job. Instead, we, the American people, are the last hope for any action, and the only way we can make progress is through continued public support of astrong and secure border.Public polling data also shows that border security is a top issue in the minds of most voters, and the illegal immigration crisis is one of the biggest problems facing our country.Moreover, nearly one-third of Americans think shutting down the southern border is the best way to deter illegal immigration. A recent poll also shows that voters’ concerns about the border have only continued to grow over the past year, with 30% now saying it’s a bigger problem than inflation, crime, and unemployment. Last spring, just 18% of respondents felt that way. Americans from both sides of the political spectrum are alsoopen to supportingmass deportations of aliens illegally in our country, with over half the country now supporting this policy, including 42 percent of Democrats.As the border crisis continues to worsen, Americans must continue supporting candidates who pledge to secure the border and stop the bleeding. Should November bring a strong coalition of border-security advocates across the House, Senate, and the White House, America may be able to begin reversing the destructive policies that have precipitated the crisis on our southern border and secure our nation from the threats posed by illegal immigration.Republican Dan Patrick is the lieutenant governor of Texas.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.
