Instead of fast-tracking potential criminals, we should offer a Patriotic Path for citizenship to those who served honorably. A third-party organization could expedite non-citizen veterans to citizenship within 12 months.Additionally, this pathway ought to allow those under the age of 22, who have been in the United States since childhood, to serve in the military and gain citizenship, thereby avoiding the enlistment of recent migrants with ill intentions.President Joe Biden has not only created a crisis — as he quickly repealed key elements of the Trump administration’s border policy upon assuming office — but he has actually incentivized the practice of illegally entering our country as well. Look no further than a recent asylum rule change that one scholar categorized as \"a big flashing ‘welcome’ sign for undocumented immigrants.\"Unfortunately, it seems that Biden would rather continue to advertise a problematic path to citizenship for millions of illegal aliens rather than taking care of the men and women who have already served our country — citizens and legal residents alike.As the CEO of VetComm — an organization dedicated to ensuring veterans are properly compensated by the VA for their disabilities — I can say the audacity and malicious intent it takes to give away funds meant for veterans to illegal migrants is unforgivable. Do our veterans deserve neglect and deportation while the millions of recent illegal immigrants desecrate and destroy cities across the country?Given that they have fulfilled their promises to our nation, I believe it is time we secure border and do the same.
