That meant that doctors validly prescribing certain medications might be exempt from the Comstock Act, as would patients acting under a physician's advice.Some members of the antiabortion movement are pushing for a comeback for the Comstock Act, fighting for localordinancesthat assert an obligation to follow federal law, including the Comstock Act.The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a socially conservative group, has filed a lawsuit in Texas that hinges onapplication of Comstock's law. These groups suggest that the Comstock Act applies far more broadly-to the mailing of any abortion pill, to anyone, anywhere. They question the interpretation of the law offered by courts  since the 1910s-and stress that this interpretation only ever applied to birth control, not abortion drugs.While the Department of Justice under the Biden administrationhas already rejectedthis argument, that seems unlikely to dissuade antiabortion groups. Their hope is surely to bring their arguments about the Comstock Act to conservative judges-and ultimately, to the conservative supermajority of the US Supreme Court.The goal for many leaders of the antiabortion movement in the US is a national ban on abortion-preferably, one that recognizes the personhood of the fetus and establishes thatabortion itself is unconstitutional. Given the Supreme Court's composition, this kind of personhood argument may eventually capture the support of the justices, but likely not anytime soon.Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who holds one of the definitive votes in abortion cases, wrote this summer that the Constitution is \"neither pro-life nor pro-choice,\" and he is unlikely to reverse course in the near term. But if the Court relies on the Comstock Act, the antiabortion movement might be able to secure the equivalent of a ban on all abortion medication without Kavanaugh having to contradict himself.The question before the Supreme Court in a case about the Comstock Act would not likely be a constitutional one. Instead, the justices would have to weigh competing interpretations of the law. Does it apply to the mailing of abortion pills only when there is an intent to violate the law? Or does it bar anyone from ever mailing abortion pills? If the Court says that the Comstock Act bans the mailing of all abortion pills, that would make it difficult for anyone to access them-abortion clinics receive pills from drug companies, as do pharmacies and patients relying on telehealth.In New Mexico, the attorney general asked the state supreme court to block local ordinances that ban abortion andinvoke the Comstock Act. This suit could give conservative judges a chance to hold that the Comstock Act is enforceable everywhere, including in blue states.For abortion foes, that's a key first step in getting their sweeping interpretation of the Comstock Act heard in federal court, with the hope that an appeal makes it to the Supreme Court's conservative supermajority.If the Supreme Court interprets the Comstock Act to ban the mailing of abortion pills, the Biden administration's Department of Justice would likely not make enforcement of the act a priority. That would sharpen the already-high stakes of the 2024 election, especially for blue states. A Republican president could take a very different position on enforcing of the Comstock Act, with dire consequences.For those in blue states, this growing focus on the Comstock Act should be a wakeup call. Now is the time to begin working toward the repeal of the law.True, parts of it may violate the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech, and the law's provisions on contraception obviously contradict Supreme Court rulingsprotecting birth control. But the law's provisions on abortion face no obstacles (and the Supreme Court's willingness to protect birth control is certainly in question if the Court consistently applies the test it laid out in its decision last summer overruling Roe v. Wade).As it stands, supporters of abortion rights may simply hope that courts will see a strategy predicated on the Comstock Act as a step too far, even for conservative judges. But progressives once had a hard time believing that the Supreme Court would destroy abortion rights. We all know how that story ended.In the next few years, access to abortion may not be a problem only in the states across the South and Midwest that have chosen to ban it. While much remains uncertain, one thing is clear: if Anthony Comstock knew what was happening with his famous law, he would be pleased.Opinion by Mary ZieglerTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
