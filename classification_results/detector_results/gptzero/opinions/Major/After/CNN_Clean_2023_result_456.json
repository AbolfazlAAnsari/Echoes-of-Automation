Look around at your friends, your family, your neighbors and yourself: Chances are that most of the people you know wouldn't have been fully free or equal even after the ratification of the Constitution, and certainly would not have been promised freedom or equality by American independence.All of which is to say: Betterment is the outcome of tireless generational work. The work of feminists and civil rights advocates is not done. Neither is the work of keeping us all safer from endemic violence.This week, as we celebrate our country's past, we can also pause to imagine a better future - one where all people in this country are more equal, to be sure, and also one in which we can find peace inside our homes and outside of them, and can enjoy both the most mundane aspects of life and the most extraordinary ones without fear that we'll be gunned down.Opinion by Jill FilipovicTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
