            "inputText": "In the wake of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s rebellion, Vladimir Putin is doubling down on failure.In the wake of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s failed rebellion, it seems as if Russia’s leaders are living in an alternate reality.The sequence of events speaks for itself. Russian troops waved through Wagner columns on their way to Moscow, and curious civiliansgreeted themin the street withsnacks; President Vladimir Putin recast this sight as a unified Russian society. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu hid out of sight as his subordinates chatted with Mr. Prigozhin; he emerged days later to praise officers for theirloyalty. One of Russia’s most experienced generals, Sergei Surovikin, was filmed in a nondescript room requesting that Wagner stand down; he has not been seen since, while Russia’s incompetent military leadership team remains in place. Most strangely, Mr. Prigozhin — the architect of it all — goes between beingunpersonedto apparently meeting with Mr. Putin to smooth overdifferences of opinion.It’s been a bizarre few weeks. Yet on the ground, the Russian war effort grinds on as before. During the brief rebellion, operations continued as planned, and the chain of command held. There were no signs of mass refusals, desertions or mutinies. For now, Russia’s defensive positions — stretching from Belgorod in the east to Crimea in the south — are still secure.But for how long? The problems endemic to Russia’s campaign in Ukraine are likely to worsen. Mr. Shoigu and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s highest-ranking officer, will continue to conduct the war in an inept fashion. Retained by Mr. Putin for their loyalty, they are now even more likely to suppress negative information and present a distorted image of the war. Housecleaning inside the military, seeminglyunderway, will only increase the dysfunction. For the sake of familiarity, the Kremlin has chosen to reinforce failure.Whatever his fate will be after the failed rebellion, Mr. Prigozhin’s criticisms of the war are still dangerous — because they are correct. He repeatedly pointed out, in coarse, angry language, how the war ismismanagedat the highest levels by out-of-touch bureaucrats, leading to many logistical problems andammunition shortages. He criticized Mr. Shoigu and General Gerasimov fordownplaying bad newsand misleading Mr. Putin while engaging inpetty intrigueswith subordinates. He noted how the children of Russia’selite avoidmilitary service while the poor return home in coffins.But Mr. Putin’s cocoon of loyal interlocutors filters out these problems and instead offers a substitute view to both the president and a disengaged public. Dmitri Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia’s national security council, says 185,000 men joined the Russianmilitary in 2023 alone. The Ministry of Defense claims to have destroyed overtwice as manyHIMARS trucks as were ever delivered to Ukraine. As Mr. Shoigu says, “Everything is proceeding according to plan.” None of this is true.The disappearance of General Surovikin is a more telling sign of where things stand. Known for his focus and ruthless tactics — including the leveling of cities in Syria and Ukraine — he took command of Russian forces last fall, ordering the construction of Russia’sextensive defensive positions. (They are colloquially known as Surovikin lines.) He was soon demoted in favor of General Gerasimov, who within weeks of assuming command began anineffective and costlywinter offensive. General Surovikin, a decorated veteran of four wars with cachet among military, veteran and blogger communities, looked all the wiser by comparison. Now rumors are swirling of his detention as punishment for his longstanding ties to Mr. Prigozhin andpossible knowledgeof the rebellion. The delay in information regarding his whereabouts suggests the Kremlin is still deciding how to proceed.In this atmosphere of suspicion and uncertainty, in which prominent generals disappear and Mr. Putin is quick toblame traitors, self-censorship among top military leaders is likely to become more prevalent. Mr. Shoigu and General Gerasimov, now even more dependent on Mr. Putin for their safety and positions, could be more likely to hide or soften bad news from the battlefield to keep his confidence. That would further undermine the Kremlin’s grasp on the true state of the war at a crucial time in the conflict.All is not well onRussian front lines. It is still not clear whether Wagner troops will fully withdraw from Ukraine. If they depart, higher casualties will be borne by regular military units at a time when they can hardly afford more losses. The Russian Army, according to the head of Britain’s armed forces, has alreadylost halfof its combat effectiveness and may not have the strength to hold out against the Ukrainian counteroffensive that’s underway. Hunkered down in their defensive positions, some frontline units have little rest and lack a sufficient reserve force to relieve them. Regular Ukrainian strikes onammunition depots, logistics nodes andcommand postsmake everything harder. For complaining about these untenable conditions, at least two generalswere dismissedrecently.All this could create an opening for Ukrainian forces to exploit if they have the means. But they are experiencing difficulties, too. Subjected to persistent artillery strikes and without adequate air support, they are struggling tocut throughdense Russian minefields. Their combat engineers now manually clear mines — extremely dangerous and painstaking work. When Ukrainian forces have been able to reach Russian trenches, they’ve often been able to clear them. Thecluster munitionsrecently sent by the United States should also help.For now, the Russian front lines are holding, despite the Kremlin’s dysfunctional decisions. Yet the cumulative pressure of bad choices is mounting.
