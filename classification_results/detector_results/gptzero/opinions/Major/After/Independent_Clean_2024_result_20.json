Despite the inevitable sideshow Trump drama, she is now the establishment’s final chance to beat him.She could take Trump down a peg on Wednesday, though he is well out ahead. But New Hampshire (since Chris Christie dropped out) is a different story. Although “uneventful”, the primary is more or less now a one-on-one contest.And, no pun intended, Haley is in fact biting at Trump’s heels with a close race expected in New England, after. Still, with the final results from Iowa, Trump could get a larger vote there than any GOP non-incumbent.Yet Haley is anything but down and out. Some on the right are willing to admit that she is indeed an establishment favourite, and for good reason: she is tougher. Combative, too.I am glad that Haley is supported by mainline GOP voters, unlike right-wing fanatics, obsessed with egotistical Trump.Angus WestBoston, MA"
