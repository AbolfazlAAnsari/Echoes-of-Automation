            "inputText": "If you thought housing in Canada was already expensive, buried in the Trudeau government's Emissions Reduction Plan (ERP) is a little-noticed provision that would raise the cost of building new homes even higher. On page 201 of the ERP(https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2022/eccc/En4-460-2022-eng.pdf), in the bottom of a table listing proposed building code revisions, lies an astonishing requirement: \"Increase energy efficiency such that new (residential) buildings use 61 per cent less energy by 2025 and 65 per cent less energy by 2030 in comparison to 2019.\" A companion proposal requires commercial buildings to meet a 47 per cent target by 2025 and 59 per cent by 2030, compared to 2019.A 65 per cent reduction in energy use compared to 2019 is an extraordinary hurdle to new home construction. It would be hard enough to make new Canadian homes 65 per cent more efficient compared to ones built in 1919! But in 2019 new homes were already highly energy efficient, so to try to force another 65 per cent in efficiency gains will cost a great deal.How much exactly? In a new study(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/wrong-move-at-the-wrong-time-economic-impacts-of-the-new-federal-building-energy-efficiency-mandates) published by the Fraser Institute, I use Canadian Home Builders Association estimates of cost increments on new home construction for many types of energy-efficiency gains. By compiling these, I estimated that hitting the 65 per cent target will raise building costs across the country by 8.3 per cent (on average). New home construction costs vary across the country. I estimate the increase will be $22,000-$35,000 in Atlantic Canada and on the Prairies, $38,000 in Quebec, and more than $70,000 in Ontario and British Columbia, yielding a national average of about $55,000 per home.Using a macro model of the Canadian economy, I estimate further that these increases in residential (and commercial) construction costs will cause an appreciable drop in national GDP (1.8 per cent as of 2030), and a 6.8-per cent decline in construction activity as of 2030 compared to the no-policy base case. At a time when we need \"all hands on deck\" in the homebuilding sector, we could instead see more than 80,000 construction-related job losses and an exodus of capital from the sector.But at least we will reduce greenhouse gases, right? Not really. There's ample evidence in the economics literature that energy-efficiency mandates have little impact on emissions and come at a relatively high cost. Yes, they make it cheaper to, for example, heat or illuminate your home. But people respond to that change in part by using more heat and light. This is the so-called rebound effect, which in the long run, the evidence suggests, negates virtually all the initial gains from tighter energy-efficiency rules. But even if I assume a low rebound effect in the macro model, the emission reductions are only about one per cent by 2030. Since GDP contracts by almost two per cent, the emission intensity of Canada's economy actually increases. And the emission reductions we do get cost about 50 times more per tonne than the proposed carbon tax(https://financialpost.com/tag/carbon-tax/) rate. Adding regulations like this on top of a carbon tax destroys the economic efficiency of the emission pricing instrument.But won't households benefit from mandated improvements in energy efficiency? No, this is a common misconception. People who own or are buying a home already have the option to invest in energy-efficiency improvements - and they do, up to a point. But beyond that, the extra features are worth less to them than other things they can purchase. Some energy analysts assume that households are, in effect, too stupid to know how to spend their own money so regulations that force them to overinvest in efficiency improvements will make them better off. As I discuss in my study, this view is rejected in the economics literature both in principle and on the basis of analysis of the payoffs from government energy-efficiency programs.'Woke' ESG regulations leading to policy chaos(https://financialpost.com/opinion/woke-esg-regulations-create-policy-chaos)What Liberals should be doing to encourage home building(https://financialpost.com/opinion/what-liberals-should-do-encourage-home-building)Back off, premiers, and let Bank of Canada do its job(https://financialpost.com/opinion/back-off-premiers-bank-of-canada-job)Canada faces a housing crisis of historic proportions. Young people and newcomers, even those with decent jobs and substantial savings, have been priced out of the housing market(https://financialpost.com/tag/housing-market/) and face a future with no realistic hope of homeownership. Our focus needs to be on how to fix this crisis - in part by cutting the cost of new home construction. The radical energy-efficiency requirements in the federal Emission Reduction Plan will do the opposite while yielding virtually no environmental benefit. It's the wrong move at the wrong time and should be rescinded.Ross McKitrick, professor of economics at the University of Guelph, is a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
