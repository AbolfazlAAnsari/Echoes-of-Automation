            "inputText": "By Peter Jon Mitchell ?Canada's $10-a-day childcare(https://financialpost.com/tag/child-care/) program is failing. The federal government and its provincial partners face a real mess. The provinces have rapidly reduced fees but are falling short in creating new spaces. To address the accessibility problem, Quebec is sacrificing quality to increase quantity. If the other provinces don't change course now, they're likely in for the same fate as Quebec.Some provinces and territories have reached $10-a-day ahead of schedule. But unclear funding mechanisms(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontario-changes-funding-rules-in-bid-to-boost-10-a-day-child-care/) and cost-control frameworks(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-alberta-child-care-operators-say-there-is-a-lack-of-information-around/) have increased uncertainty for many childcare providers. Without long-term stability many won't create new spaces.The rapid reduction in fees is driving up demand(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/now-that-daycare-is-cheaper-in-ontario-demand-is-up-are-working-parents-getting-squeezed-out-1.6757416) for highly subsidized licensed care, including from families wishing to switch from non-subsidized options. One recent estimate suggests there are only three licensed spaces for every 10 children(https://childcarecanada.org/sites/default/files/Early-Childhood-Education-and-Care-2021_0.pdf) whose families want one. Federal-provincial agreements specify annual space-creation targets, but what data are available suggest most provinces(https://parl-gc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/delivery/01CALP_INST:01CALP/12153471040002616?lang=en) haven't come close to hitting their targets yet.Like many sectors, childcare faces a labour shortage(https://financialpost.com/tag/labour-shortage/). Providers struggle to find qualified staff(https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/daily-quotidien/230322/dq230322b-eng.pdf?st=Yqc2RpO9). The YMCA reports(https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2023/06/08/ontario-to-boost-early-childhood-educator-wages-in-bid-to-ease-staff-shortage.html) that staffing shortages mean none of its Ontario childcare facilities is running at capacity so expansion is out of the question for now. Provinces are trying to fix this by improving salaries(https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2023/06/08/ontario-to-boost-early-childhood-educator-wages-in-bid-to-ease-staff-shortage.html) and subsidizing tuition for students in early-learning and childcare training programs.The shortage of licensed spaces is also self-inflicted. Federal-provincial agreements either limit space creation funding or deny it altogether to providers who operate as businesses. Not only does this prevent independent operators from expanding, it's slowly starving them out of business. In effect, the provinces have agreed to tie one hand behind their backs just when they need all the help they can get.Quebec is facing the same problems despite two decades of operating the childcare system that became a model for the national plan. As others have pointed out(https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/may-2023/early-childhood-spaces-quebec-lessons/), Quebec's 2021 action plan trades quality for accessibility. While there is no consistently agreed-on definition of childcare quality, staffing qualifications and child-to-staff ratios are usually considered key indicators.By these measures quality continues to suffer in Quebec. The province has some of the highest caregiver-to-child ratios in Canada, including one caregiver for every five infants.?And its current plan increases the number of children a facility can legally accommodate, while lowering the requirements to become a qualified early childhood educator. Childcare is prone to overregulation, but some quality measures such as smaller ratios make sense. Childcare centres can expand their capacity from 80 children to 100 while there are incentives for home childcare providers to increase the number of kids in their care from six to nine. To increase the number of qualified early-childhood educators, the province offers several different levels of qualification. The highest requires nearly 2,500 hours of training while the minimal option is a mix of classroom and work experience totalling 975 hours.Quebec daycares can employ uncertified staff but must maintain a ratio of two certified staff to one uncertified employee. Responding to staffing shortages during the pandemic, the province temporarily changed the ratio to one certified staff member to two uncertified employees. The current ratio allowed is now one certified caregiver to one uncertified worker. Uncertified caregivers remain essential to the system.All this flexibility allowed Quebec to add over 9,000 spaces in about a year. Will other provinces again follow its lead?Although the national program is now in year three of its five-year, $30-billion kickoff, most families continue to see no benefit from it. The provinces are feeling the pressure to increase highly subsidized spaces and the path of least resistance is to lower standards. For its part, the federal government both failed to grasp the complexity of provincial childcare programs and seriously underestimated costs. The result will be the entrenchment of a poor-quality program most families end up not using. Even if sacrificing quality increases enrolment, parents engaged in shift work or with other needs not met by the one-size-fits all model will miss out.In Canada's airline industry, real competition means fewer competitors(https://financialpost.com/opinion/canada-airline-industry-real-competition-fewer-competitors)The last thing we need is Ottawa taking on the productivity problem(https://financialpost.com/opinion/ottawa-productivity-problem)Net zero's march to impoverishment: How is lower GDP an 'opportunity'?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/net-zero-impoverishment-how-lower-gdp-opportunity)The federal government could instead have offered families a package of policies to address affordability that accommodated the variety of care parents use. Provinces should change course to force the federal government's hand. And parents should demand no less.Peter Jon Mitchell is family program director at the Cardus think-tank. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved."
