Theaveragegrade point average at Harvard today is 3.8 and the university brags about its 96% graduation rate. The lesson here is that once students get into Harvard, they get A’s and they graduate. Period.More than two decades ago, Harvard philosopher Harvey Mansfield developed the practice of issuing students two sets of grades: One that reflected an honest assessment of their performance and another designed to mesh with \"Harvard’s inflated grades.\"ELITE AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES RECEIVING BILLIONS IN FEDERAL FUNDS SEE RISE IN ANTISEMITISM: ‘GAMED THE TAX CODE’It’s long been presumed that it’s valuable for colleges like Harvard to curate \"diverse\" communities of future leaders.

And they get celebrated for it.So, no, Harvard’s students are not \"all right.\" And that matters greatly, for all of us.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM FREDERICK HESSGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
