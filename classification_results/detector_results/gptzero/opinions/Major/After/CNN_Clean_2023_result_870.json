The world ignores our plight and denies our humanity, blaming us for our own oppression. I feel like I'm trapped in an alternate dimension, struggling to process my surroundings without losing my sanity or my soul.The bias and selective outrage of Western governments isn't new. They have never seen or cared about us as we have suffered under Israel's occupation, violence and discrimination, year after year, decade after decade.The question is, where do we go from here?As I navigate the minefield of self-censorship and external oppression, I ponder the worthiness of Palestinians denouncing violence and pleading for a just peace. In a world that ignores our cries, I question whether my words can break through, knowing well that if they don't, it will likely be because I'm Palestinian.During every escalation of violence, US media reveal their bias towards Israel, largely omitting Palestinian voices from the equation. The loss of life reported on the news is horrific, yet Western journalists and politicians show much less concern when Israel has inflicted mass violence and casualties on Palestinians repeatedly over the past decades.I yearn for the world to see us, too - to hear us, and acknowledge our humanity and our right to live in freedom and safety like everyone else. Is there still space for raw humanity and aching hearts amid conversations about power dynamics and political victories? If there were, we would have been free long ago.The relentless, brutal Israeli military assaults and the oppressive conditions of the blockade of our borders have failed to desensitize me. It's impossible to forget or ignore that these decades of Israeli military occupation color every facet of our existence and fragment our land and our people.For many of us, this, however limited, is our greatest power: to dream and to feel pain in a world that seeks to dull our edges and dim our brightest lights. For now, I raise my voice, I continue to read, I continue to write, and I continue to hope.Opinion by Omar GhraiebTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
