And an endorsement fromour shortest-ever serving PMis hardly a shining credential.Maybe I am out of step: Are these really the people who should be our leaders? God help us all.Alastair DuncanWinchesterWe blame men when society fails themOn reading The Independent’s request for readers to share their viewson the Sydney stabbing, I felt compelled to write.From the news reports, it seems clear that the perpetrator of the stabbings was suffering from a serious mental health condition. However, his reported anger about“not being able to find a girlfriend”is common to many other men, too – we need look no further than theonline “incel” communitiesthat have formed in recent years.Having embarked on my own personal development journey, I am of the opinion that, due to a lack of guidance and education, many modern men lack the required skills to manage their emotions – in short, many of us walk through life with extremely low levels of emotional maturity. The blame for this should not be put on men, as how can we know what we have never been taught?I am of the opinion that society in general fails to give men the tools they need to be the best version of themselves. This is further compounded by cliched tropes such as “be a man”, “man up” and “boys don’t cry” – we are still being told to “bottle it all up”.As with so many problems in the world, I believe the solution to this lies withinproviding better educationand mental healthcare. At school, I was taught so many skills that have never proved any practical use in life. For the sake of everyone in society, the way we educate children about emotional regulation desperately needs a complete overhaul.David WooldridgeAddress supplied"
