And I sleep well at night.Anthony Michael KreisAtlantaCondemn Trump’s Mockery of Biden’s StutterTo the Editor:Re “Trump Blasts Biden’s Speech and Mocks Stutter” (news article, March 11):I am a longtime stutterer. Donald Trump’s mockery of President Biden’s stutter must be quickly and strongly condemned by everyone across the political spectrum. It is unseemly and bullying, venal and unacceptable.We can differ on the issues, even forcefully, but going after a personal disability that affectsan estimated nearly three million Americans— even Republicans! — is cruel and heartless, and must be forcefully denounced.Jerry SlaffRockville, Md.Biden EnthusiastsTo the Editor:Re “Gladly Going Against Grain to Love Biden” (front page, March 5):I noted with interest your article about the people who feel isolated because they are still positive about President Biden and about re-electing him.I must report that I have had the opposite experience: In my social circle of well-informed and civically engaged friends, there is widespread enthusiasm for him. We’re aware that he’s the most pro-labor president since F.D.R. and that much historic legislation has become law during his administration.Glenna MatthewsLaguna Beach, Calif.Medications to Combat AlcoholismTo the Editor:Re “Alcohol-Related Deaths Surge to Nearly 500 a Day, C.D.C. Says” (news article, nytimes.com, Feb. 29):As a physician treating many people with addiction, I appreciate the recent coverage of the increased rates of alcohol-related deaths. The reporters cite several strategies to reduce harms from alcohol. One unmentioned and highly effective approach is to educate people on medications that can reduce alcohol cravings, and the amount people drink.Naltrexone and Acamprosate are two F.D.A.-approved medications for alcohol use disorder that can help people who binge drink or drink heavily on a regular basis. Neither drug makes someone physically ill if they consume alcohol while taking it, unlike the medication that was most commonly prescribed in previous decades:disulfiram (also known as Antabuse).Unfortunately, many people believe that they can quit drinking using willpower alone. While this approach may work for some, the vast majority of people with an alcohol use disorder will benefit from one of these two medications.I encourage every person who is concerned about their own drinking to talk with their doctor about receiving medical treatment to help them cut back or quit. People who are worried about their loved one should talk with them about how they may want to speak with their doctor about this type of care.Eileen BarrettAlbuquerqueReading the GreatsTo the Editor:Re “We Need to Read the Forgotten Geniuses, Not Rescue Them,” by Apoorva Tadepalli (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Feb. 28):When I retired from teaching English and moved to Charlottesville, Va., I missed the classroom and taught three courses at what was then the Jefferson Institute for Lifelong Learning.The classes on poetry and James Joyce’s “Dubliners” were well attended, but the surprise came when I offered Robert Fagles’s translation of Homer’s “Iliad.” I had 32 people sign up for it, and when the six weeks of class ended, they demanded that I go on to teach the “Odyssey.”I saw no reason for them to pay to hear the same historical background on Homer and ancient Greece, so I booked a meeting room at the central library and we began a literary odyssey of our own that has continued for 15 years, reading the world’s great literature, from classical authors to Dante, “Beowulf,” “Canterbury Tales,” the great Russians and beyond.I don’t teach it. We teach ourselves, spending weeks on a book, each person bringing to the group the thoughts we have while reading the canon. The pleasure we get from reading “the greats” has enriched our lives and given us a strong bond. I no longer teach. I share.Carolyn McGrathCharlottesville, Va.This article appeared in print on page A19."
