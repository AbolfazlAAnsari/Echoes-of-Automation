Those who opt not to run should get behind the best viable alternative, preferably before the end of the summer.The example set by Democrats last presidential election is instructive: Recognizing the rising threat of Vermont socialist Bernie Sanders in 2020, the Democrats fell in line behind a flawed Joe Biden, even after his drubbing in the New Hampshire's primary. The results speak for themselves.The second lesson is, prosecute Trump from his right flank with an honest evaluation where he is most vulnerable on conservative issues.Yes, his conduct around the 2020 election and the January 6 riots at the US Capitol - which just last week led to the convictions of four members of the Proud Boys forseditious conspiracy - will be seen as disqualifying for many voters. And his numerous legal entanglements will give no doubt many other voters pause.There is, however, a litany of other issues demonstrating that Trump failed to execute a conservative policy agenda when he had the ability to.The national debt rose nearly$8 trillion dollarsunder the so-called businessman president. Mexico has yet to fund the wall, and our southern border remains wide open, fueling the surgingopioid and fentanyl crisis.Meanwhile,test scoresfor American students are dropping at rates not seen in decades. Americans remain rightfully angry at school lockdowns that lasted far too long - and should remember that Trump outsourced many public policy decisions to unelected health figures during the throes of the pandemic. It's easy to criticize Covid decisions with the benefit of hindsight, but that does not absolve Trump.Finally, we would do well to remember Trump's greatest perceived strength: He bills himself as a fighter.

Powelldeclares the systemis \"sound and resilient\" even with a fiscal cliff looming and our leaders taking cuts to the biggest drivers of spending off the table.This economic landscape is tailor-made for a change agent promising to upend the status quo. Trump's challenge however is that he had his chance. He blew it, and he knows it: That's the reason he'sbalkingat the schedule of upcoming Republican debates.The GOP has lost three consecutive elections with Trump as its de facto leader. The sameWashington Post/ABC Newspoll Republicans are touting because of Biden's horrible numbers, shows that only 33% of voters calling Trump \"honest and trustworthy.\"Conservatives appear not to be ready for a return to the White House of a soon-to-be 77-year-old failed businessman who is facing the prospect of multiple legal investigations.Republicans need to clean up our own house - and it's going to take more than abysmal approval numbers by the Democratic incumbent president to make things right.Opinion by Geoff DuncanTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
