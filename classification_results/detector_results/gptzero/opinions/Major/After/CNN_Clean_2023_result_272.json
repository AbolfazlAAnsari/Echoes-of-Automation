Perhaps the most notable aspect of the indictment is how egregious the alleged wrongdoing was.

In so doing, it is our view that it makes an overwhelming if not yet proven criminal case against the congressman. He has responded with an initial \"not guilty\" plea and proclaimed his innocence. We do not yet know whether Santos will follow that by attempting to negotiate a plea deal. But that is what most criminal defendants in federal court ultimately do.
