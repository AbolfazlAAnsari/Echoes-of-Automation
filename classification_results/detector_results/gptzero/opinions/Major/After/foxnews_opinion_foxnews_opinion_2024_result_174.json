Team Kamala believes they can simply ride the current sugar high for the next 95 days or so without doing one single press conference or real interview. But here's the thing: She still trails Trump on average nationally and in almost every swing state. The Harris team is allowing Trump to define her, which is quite easy to do, given her own comments in the past.A microcosm of Trump's strength versus Harris' weakness was on display once again in Chicago during theNational Association of Black Journalists' conventionon Wednesday afternoon.The Republican nominee was treated with outright hostility by Rachel Scott of ABC News straight out of the gate, but Trump hammered home his points around illegal immigration impacting minorities through social services being drastically cut regarding sanitation, education and police to help pay to support those in the country illegally. Trump also underscored the cruel tax that inflation is to all communities, regardless of color.Meanwhile, Harris decided to blow off the event and instead will do it by Zoom instead.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONWhy? Because her people know that if she ever had to take questions from an objective, prepared moderator, someone for example, like Fox News’ Harris Faulkner, it would be utterly disastrous to her campaign.She simply does not have the ability to think or speak extemporaneously. And her policy positions are almost indefensible.Ultimately, this race will come down to any debates Trump and Harris have. But here's a prediction: Trump is arguing, rightly so, that he agreed to debate Biden, not Harris, on ABC in September. But now Harris is saying the debate agreement still stands.No, it does not. Trump and Harris are supposed to debate now, making the prior agreement with Biden null and void.Harris says she'll still show up to the ABC debate regardless if Trump is there. I predict theformer presidentwill hold his ground, and the vice president will declare he chickened out while also declaring that there will be no more debates because Trump is \"afraid\" of her, with the media cheering her on every step of the way.And that's the goal: Avoid Trump, and any substantive questions, at all costs. And try to eke out a win without ever being held to account.So, who is Kamala Harris?We may never truly know. At least not until after Election Day.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JOE CONCHAJoe Concha is a FOX News contributor who joined the network in 2020.
