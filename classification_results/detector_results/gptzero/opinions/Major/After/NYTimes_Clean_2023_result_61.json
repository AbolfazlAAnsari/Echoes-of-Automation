Also: Ron DeSantis and immigration; trans athletes; alternatives to opioids; tips for food deliveries.To the Editor:Re “I Am Going Blind, and I Now Find It Strangely Exhilarating,” by Edward Hirsch (Opinion guest essay, April 1):I cannot begin to tell you how disturbing Mr. Hirsch’s article was for me. His loss of vision has been gradual, and he knew what was happening. Mine was sudden, and I did not have a clue. Suddenly I had flashing lights in my left eye and my vision was dimmed.Now I am trying to adjust. Reading my New York Times every morning with a magnifying glass is a frustrating, unsatisfying experience. Gone are the hours I have spent buried in books. Writing checks? Forget it.Suddenly I must walk with a cane because seeing the sidewalk is difficult. I have had to hire an aide because I can no longer drive and I want to get out of the house for errands. As I type this letter I can see, but all the letters are blurred.And I live in terror that this can happen again. No, I do not find loss of vision exhilarating.Ruth MessineoWoodland Park, N.J.To the Editor:Thank you for Edward Hirsch’s guest essay.I, too, am going blind. I am angry and scared, and feel as though my life is useless and basically over.Maybe tomorrow I will wake up and look beyond my despair to the possibility of excitement in my life and approach it with the vigor I once had.Mr. Hirsch’s essay lifted my spirits and gave me hope. I would like it to touch others in the same way.Sandra Smith-WiesePortsmouth, N.H.To the Editor:I was a disability rights lawyer and brought many cases implementing the Americans With Disabilities Act. I have recently become a person with a disability, though not blind: I can no longer stand or use steps, and I am at tremendous risk of falling.Yet the process that Edward Hirsch describes is exactly what I went through: denial, shame in accepting my disability and an occasional dependence on others.If a person like Mr. Hirsch can deal with disability, so can I and others as we age and our bodies fail us. I hope the barriers to equal access — steps, cracked pavements, broken elevators to subways — are rapidly repaired, so that people with disabilities like Mr. Hirsch and me gain the equal access that our country promised us when the A.D.A. was enacted.Steve GoldPhiladelphiaThe DeSantis Crackdown on ImmigrationTo the Editor:Re “DeSantis Seeks Tightest Clamp on Immigration in the Country” (front page, April 11):The most immediate effect of this package of exclusionary measures may be on those seeking health care. I see immigrants every day during my hospital rounds. I wonder how many would be there if they were forced to report their immigration status.The chilling effect could be huge, and this would have significant adverse consequences for the health of Floridians in general: Parents who are discouraged from getting children vaccinated for communicable diseases. Young mothers who don’t get prenatal care or hospital-based deliveries and have negative birth outcomes. People who get a late cancer diagnosis (think: melanoma, in Florida!) and whose life expectancy is dramatically shortened. The list of possibilities is endless.It’s entirely possible that Florida taxpayers would end up paying far more to treat immigrants in extremis and nonimmigrants whose health is damaged by contact with untreated immigrants than they would save by discouraging the undocumented from getting preventive care. That’s precisely the calculation made by the states that have expanded access.The actual impact will be determined partly by the capacity of community clinics and other providers that “don’t ask” when immigrants appear. Does Florida have enough such capacity to take up the slack when hospitals start enforcing Gov. Ron DeSantis’s new edict?Wayne A. CorneliusPortland, Ore.The author is emeritus professor of global public health at the University of California, San Diego, and volunteers in critical care hospitals.A Good Compromise on Trans AthletesTo the Editor:Re “Trans Athletes Facing Limits in Biden Plan” (front page, April 7):This is the compromise that I, a proud feminist, have been hoping for. It balances inclusive participation with competition.I’m dismayed by comments about “men’s” and “women’s” sports, when what this policy really addresses is school sports for kids before gender plays a major role in physical development.Do we really want to prevent a 10-year-old trans girl from being on a team with her friends? By the time girls and boys become women and men they will be governed by regulatory bodies like the N.C.A.A., which already have rules in place to promote fair competition.The tricky time is high school, when sex differences become more pronounced and when athletes are potentially competing for college scholarships. This policy gives local school officials flexibility without making a blanket ban.Also, some perspective please: There aren’t that many transgender athletes, so cisgender girls will rarely be competing with trans girls in K-12.Susan BrownArlington, Mass.Alternatives to OpioidsTo the Editor:Re “F.D.A. Will Make Anti-Opioid Drug Widely Available” (front page, March 30):I applaud the Food and Drug Administration for authorizing over-the-counter Narcan. However, this step, while important, is unlikely to make a dent in the current opioid epidemic on its own. While overdose death prevention is critical, we must also look upstream at solutions we can enact now to prevent addiction before it begins.Last year Congress showed its commitment to fighting the opioid epidemic upstream bypassing the Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation (NOPAIN) Act. It will expand access to non-opioids in outpatient surgical settings and prevent millions of new cases of persistent opioid use that begin every year following a surgical procedure.Unfortunately, the NOPAIN Act doesn’t go into effect until 2025, leaving tens of millions of patients without nonaddictive options, including those who may undergo a surgery as common as wisdom teeth removal. To finish this fight, the Biden administration must work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to accelerate implementation of the NOPAIN Act to 2024.A year lost puts millions of Americans at unnecessary risk for addiction.Chris FoxWashingtonThe writer is the executive director of the Voices for Non-Opioid Choices Coalition.Tips for Food DeliveriesTo the Editor:Re “$388 in Sushi. A $20 Tip” (Sunday Business, April 9):It is unfortunate and unfair that those who deliver food are poorly paid and that their income depends on the generosity of customers. It is also illogical that their expected pay is linked to the price of the food that has been ordered.Whether food is “delivered” in a restaurant or to a home, the effort is in no way commensurate with the price. An expensive small dish of caviar and an inexpensive plate of pasta require the same effort to reach the customer, yet the expected tip would differ by orders of magnitude.It is past time for servers or deliverers to be paid fairly for their time and effort rather than as a percentage of the price of the food.Ed SchorMenlo Park, Calif.This article appeared in print on page A23."
