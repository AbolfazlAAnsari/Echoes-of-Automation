A good deal of that is likely because the whole issue of the pandemic is so politicized -- but so too were the debates about whether the George W. Bush administration might have done a better job thwarting the9/11 attacks.The Bush administration initially blocked a commission to investigate 9/11. Following intense public pressure, the administration finally agreed to allow a commission to be formedmore than a year afterthe attacks.The 9/11 commission not only told the whole backstory of the attacks, but it also proposedlasting reformsthat made Americans safer when they were implemented, such as the creation of aNational Counterterrorism Centerthat coordinates all counterterrorism intelligence across the US government and the creation of a newOffice of the Director of National Intelligencewhich coordinates the work of all of the US intelligence agencies.A similar Covid-19 commission must be formed to investigate how the virus emerged, which responses to the virus worked or didn't work as it spread across the United States and the lessons learned for how best to prepare for the next pandemic.Each party should appoint subject matter experts on pandemics, epidemiology and emergency response to take part in this Covid-19 commission.  It should have sufficient staff and money and subpoena power to investigate questions such as, \"How did we get here?\" And, \"What can be done to mitigate the next pandemic?\"Of course, some questions may never be completely settled, like the lab leak theory vs. the natural transmission theory.Still, there are pressing questions that the Covid-19 commission should address so that we are better prepared for the next pandemic, which will inevitably eventually happen.Here are eleven questions that a Covid-19 commission could try and answer:Where did the coronavirus originate from?After 9/11, the US spent manybillions of dollars preparingfor a possible bioterrorism attack. Where did all that funding go and why were those defenses against bioterrorism not more helpful in responding to the pandemic?Why did theTrump administrationeliminate the National Security Council'spandemic unit in 2018? What effect did that have? An early decision by former President Donald Trump during the pandemic was to bar non-US citizens who had recently visited China from entering the US. What kind of effect did that have on mitigating the spread of the virus? Why didn't the US government ensure there were enoughmedical-grade masksto cope with the pandemic when it started?Why was there so little federal leadership on containing the virus in the early months of the pandemic?Those decisionswere primarily left to individual states. What effect did this uncoordinated response have?Trump said on February 26, 2020, that the number of Covid-19 cases would soon be close to zero. He alsoclaimedthat the coronavirus was no more dangerous than the flu. What effect did this have on the behavior of the American public and how did that behavior impact the spread of the virus?What role didright-wing mediaplay in downplaying the pandemic and how did that affect sentiments among some Republicans that the coronavirus was being hyped?Dr. Deborah Birx, Trump's coronavirus response coordinator,told a congressional committeein closed-door testimony in 2021 that \"we probably could have decreased fatalities into the 30-percent-less to 40-percent-less range.\"  How did she come to that conclusion?To its credit, the Trump administration launched \"Operation Warp Speed,\" which saved many lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. As part of that effort,the US invested $2.5 billionin Moderna, which produced a testable vaccine on humans in only two months. Why did Operation Warp Speed work so well? And what are the lessons for future vaccine development? Covid-19 mortality rates per capita in the US aremuch higher than in other wealthy nationssuch as Canada, France, Germany and Japan. What went right in other countries that didn't go right in the US?If we get some reasonable answers to these and other questions, the next pandemic that rolls around may not claim more than a million American lives.Opinion by Peter BergenTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
