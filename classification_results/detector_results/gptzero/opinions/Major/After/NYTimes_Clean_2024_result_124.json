Their protest will be successful if it moves everyone to take a moment to rethink their “investment strategies.”Elaine HessBethlehem, Pa.To the Editor:Spot on, Nicholas Kristof. It’s unbearable to watch the wrong-turn activism turn people away from the rightness of this justified protest. So much more could be accomplished — helping “real people in desperate need,” as Mr. Kristof puts it — by raising funds or putting educated boots on the ground.Maggie HillQueensTo the Editor:Re “On Campus at Columbia, in 1968 and Now,” by Serge Schmemann (Opinion, April 30):I second Mr. Schmemann’s view of the benefits of college demonstrations. Sixty years ago this December, I was part of an 800-student sit-in at Sproul Hall on the University of California’s Berkeley campus.The Free Speech Movement, as it became known, was protesting a policy that prohibited students from placing card tables on campus to solicit money and volunteers to work for voting rights and against racial bias in hiring at restaurants in Jack London Square in Oakland. Yet card tables to sell tickets for school events had been regularly allowed.Officials called the police, and we were arrested in the middle of the night. We were tried en masse, convicted of trespass and fined.I learned two lessons. First, calling the cops on students is almost always a bad idea regardless of the disruption. We would have been gone after a day or two of sleeping on Sproul Hall’s dirty floor and using its backed-up toilets.Second, watching the trial led me to switch from grad school to law school, where I learned that the university’s policy discriminated based on viewpoint and content, in violation of the First Amendment. We might have achieved the same goal with a federal court injunction, but then we would have missed out on all the student camaraderie.Stephen GillersNew YorkThe writer is emeritus professor at N.Y.U. School of Law.Trump LogicTo the Editor:Re “Trump, Seeking Presidential Immunity, Wants to Prosecute Biden” (news analysis, May 1):While it’s logically inconsistent for Donald Trump, out of one side of his mouth, to demand presidential immunity for himself while out of the other side of that same discordant mouth threaten to have Joe Biden indicted, Mr. Trump is speaking not as a logician (LOL) or a lawmaker, but as a politician rallying his base by simultaneously stoking his own anger and that of his followers.Mr. Trump has never shown the slightest ability or need to traffic in logic or consistency, knowing that the right-wing media will have his back, regardless of his unending emittance of fallacious foibles, and knowing, too, that his essential appeal to his base is built upon anger and rage, not logic and consistency, nor even a passing resemblance to facts or truth.Richard J. BrennerMiller Place, N.Y.Another Civil War in the U.S.?To the Editor:Re “How the Movie ‘Civil War’ Echoes Real Political Anxieties in America” (news article, April 24):I do believe, sadly, that political violence or even a civil war could erupt, depending on the whims of Donald Trump. Mr. Trump is running a campaign based on revenge and retribution. Look at how he tries to intimidate witnesses and court personnel regarding his various legal matters.He has said that if he wins the presidency again he will install only people completely loyal to him to run government offices, and he will use these offices to go after people he does not like.The threat of violence is a useful tool for Mr. Trump in his quest to become president again and continue to try to destroy our democracy, our governing systems and the rule of law.Do not ever underestimate him; take him at his word. If he orders his supporters to take to the streets, there is a strong possibility that enough will comply so that damage and harm will ensue, possibly marking the beginning of a civil war.We are in this dangerous moment courtesy of Mr. Trump. And he cares nothing about the consequences.Howard HermanSkokie, Ill.The Four LessonsTo the Editor:Re “The Most Important Lessons Aren’t on the Syllabus,” by Frank Bruni (Opinion guest essay, April 21):I could not agree more with Mr. Bruni’s piece. I tell my students at the New School that they may forget the content of the course, but I hope they remember three things they will learn in class: how to think, how to write and how to present an idea with enough humility that others will listen.I now have to add a fourth: the courage to stand up for what you think is right respectfully. If they accomplish this, they can consider themselves educated.Alan McGowanNew YorkThis article appeared in print on page A25."
