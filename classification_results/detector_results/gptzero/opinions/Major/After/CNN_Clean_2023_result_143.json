Hooverwroteabout his search to find a charge that would allow the government to deport Garvey, settling on mail fraud when other grounds for charges were unsuccessful.Afterthousands of Garvey's followers(the supposed victims of the fraud) petitioned for his release, his sentence was commuted in 1927. Ultimately, after Garvey's political vision had been silenced, advocates for racial justice in the United States and abroad began to focus less on economic justice and more on civil and political rights for most of the 20th century. Today, thewidening wealth gapand other indicators of inequality suggest that this shift in focus was costly.Now Democratic Rep. Yvette D. Clarke of New York, first vice-chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia are trying to set the historical record straight, recognizing the weight of evidence supporting Garvey's innocence and identifying him as a champion for the liberation of people of African descent.\"The world deserves to know the truth about Marcus Mosiah Garvey and the truth about Black history,\"Clarke declared in introducingthe resolution to exonerate the civil rights leader. Johnson added that \"it's time to right this fundamental wrong\" given the \"utter lack of merit to the charges on which he was originally convicted, combined with his profound legacy and contributions to Black history in our country.\"To be sure, Garvey's record involves some controversial decisions. This includesmeeting with the KKK, assertingcorrectlythat, during the 1920s, they had a strong voice in the US government. But this cannot stand in the way of learning about Garvey's true history and exonerating him. This is more than simply an exercise in historical truth telling and providing justice for his family, although both are immensely important.Garvey's legacy is also relevant today because we see thesame tactics- espionage and politically motivatedcharges- being deployed against Black leadersattempting to organizeagainst the status quo. For example, Black Lives Matter protesters were designated asBlack Identity Extremistsby the FBI, and informants were inserted into their movement spaces in 2020 after the George Floyd uprisings.As a society, we have failed to learn from Garvey's story. That's largely because mainstream narratives rarely teach about his legacy, and when they do, they usually fail to correct the historical inaccuracies promulgated by his wrongful conviction. By failing to learn the lessons from Garvey's case, and by underestimating the harm of politically motivated infiltration and prosecution, we open the door to continuing these policies and practices. And this will result in shame for years to come.Posthumous vindication for Garvey would begin the process of acknowledging that political sabotage from the government is antidemocratic and inherently wrong. And at a time when a battle is being waged against teachers and schools that dare discuss the African American experience, including threatening thebanning of AP African American Studies in Florida, exonerating Garvey would be an important response. It would be a clear sign of resistance to revisionist history and the urge to promote versions of the past that fail to look critically at our path to the present.Opinion by Justin Hansford and Shaq Al-HijazTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
