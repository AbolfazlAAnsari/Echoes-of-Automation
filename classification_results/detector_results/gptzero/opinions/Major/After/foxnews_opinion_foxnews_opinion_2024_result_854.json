So,Biden, Warren, Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders,et al., are trying to float the wealth tax again to see if they can trick people by saying it is targeted at the wealthy.Itâ€™s reminiscent of when the government wanted to monitor and report $600 Venmo and Etsy transactions \"for the billionaires.\"The reality is that the middle class has trillions of dollars in hard-earned wealth tied up in 401(k)s, pensions,homes, businesses and other assets.Thatâ€™s money that politicians see and are salivating over to expand their government directives.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThey hope that they can pass off lies like the White Houseâ€™s assertion that the wealthiest pay single-digit tax rates (based on their own misleading study of unrealized wealth estimates, not income).
