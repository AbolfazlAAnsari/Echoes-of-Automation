While this risks escalation, it might be necessary - and a lack of resolve is also a risk in the face of ongoing attacks.In important respects, the Middle East of the moment resembles Europe on the eve of World War I, in which entangling alliances and secret commitments pushed a cascade of combatants to tumble together into war after the first shot was fired in Sarajevo.There is a history here that goes beyond the fact that the US is allied with and supporting Israel in its war on Hamas. Iran and the US have been on the brink of open conflict since early 2020 when the USassassinatedthe notorious commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC)Qods Force, Qassem Soleimani, the man widely believed responsible for enabling attacks against American troops throughout the region.Iran has a long memory, and earlier this yearrenewedits call for revenge. For months Tehran apparently has been planning amore aggressive strategyaimed at US troops in the region.Last February, Reuters reported that Iran used earthquake relief flights to Syriaas a coverfor secret weapons shipments, and The Washington Post reported thatdocumentsleaked as part of theDiscord troverevealed plans by the IRGC Qods Force to equip and train militias with devastatingadvanced IEDs.All this may be part of an effort coordinated among Russia, Iran and Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad to expel the900 US troops in Syria, who are there to counter the Islamic State. The2,500 American troopsstill in Iraq on anadvise-and-assist missionwill also present tempting targets.That means at the very least thatIran is well-positioned to heighten already roiling tensions in the Middle East after spending decadesbuilding a network of proxies and terror cells in Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere to act as a forward line of defense for a clerical regime that sees itself as surrounded by external threats. Most important - especially in the case of Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon - these furnish a direct front and capable forces in the armed fight for Israel's destruction.But there's also a deeper question of what exactly Iran did to bring about this crisis in the first place with the October 7 attacks - and what that says about where it goes from here.In Gaza, Iran has helped transform and expand the capabilities of Hamas (and its smaller cousin,Palestinian Islamic Jihad, also involved in the recent attacks on Israel) almost since the group's inception in 1987. Tehran has supplied a wide array ofrockets, missilesandother weapons, while Israeli intelligence has assessed that it manages asophisticated and complicated ratlinesmuggling weaponry from Iran to Yemen to Sudan by sea, to Egypt by truck, through the Sinai courtesy of Bedouin smugglers, and from there into Gaza via Hamas' extensive network of cross-border tunnels. In addition, Iran hasprovided Hamas up to $100 millionannually, according to a 2021 State Department report.Given that largess, some Biden opponents have charged that the $6 billion inembargoed oil sales\"released\" to Iran in exchange forfreeing five American hostagesin September played a role in financing the Hamas attack. But thefunds are held in an accountcontrolled by Qatar and carefully monitored for humanitarian purposes, and none of those funds (now frozen) had been released at the time of the attack.It's also important to note that Iran has never been at a loss for funds to support its clients, notwithstanding internationallyfrozen assets, heavy international sanctions and abiding economic problems. Ironically, such spending is controversial even in Iran itself; revelations concerning the substantial billions Iranspends on foreign adventurismhelped fuel anti-government protests in 2018.There has been much speculation about whether, given these well-documented ties, Iran ordered the Hamas operation in southern Israel. The White House has tentatively concluded that while Tehran has provided material assistance that could facilitate such an operation, it hasno informationto suggest that Iran did so.Despite a story in The Wall Street Journal of Hamas sources claimingIran helped plan the attack,there is no analytical unanimity, and no firm public evidence, verifying this report. Other intelligence reported in the WSJ thatHamas militants recently receivedsome specialized training in Iran hasn't been linked specifically to the October 7 attacks.WhileIran shares an anti-Israel agenda with Hamas, manyexperts assessit has never had the ability to control it and doesn't require prior authorization for its activities. It is reasonable to assume, as the US has said, thatIran was surprised(albeitpleased) with the October 7 operations.All of which is consistent with the fact that neither Iran nor Hezbollah appear to have committed to more intensive involvement - yet Iran is reportedly fearful of a harsh responseif it crosses Israel's red lines. Meanwhile, Hezbollah'sprobing attacksin Israel's north over the past two weeks may be intended as signs of solidarity with Hamas and to keep Israel distracted from Gaza. And while the Iran-allied Houthis in Yemen havefired shotsat Israel in recent days, they haven't yet posed a serious threat to the Jewish state.Still, Iran and its allies have theirred lines, too. Iran-backed forces in Iraq and the Houthis in Yemen haveboth threatenedAmerican targets if the US intervenes; Iran has warned against Israeli strikes on Iranian soil; andHezbollah has hintedthat any attempt by Israel to eliminate Hamas would be met with a major response.The situation could tip in a number of directions depending on the smallest actions, and even the domestic considerations, of the parties. For example, the alleged beating-induced coma in Iran of 16-year-oldArmita Geravandfor refusing to comply with Islamic dress laws earlier this month recalls thedramatic nationwide demonstrationsagainst the morality police last year that authorities were hard pressed to put down. If a distraction is needed, could Iran's clerical leaders look to a dramatic foreign crisis?Miscalculations - whether by Iran, Israel, Hezbollah or even the US - could rapidly lead to a multifront regional war with casualties easily numbering in the tens of thousands. None of the major parties involved appears to have a compelling strategy to address the long-term dangers. The key players might benefit from a pause for reflection, before it's too late.Opinion by Charles DunneTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
