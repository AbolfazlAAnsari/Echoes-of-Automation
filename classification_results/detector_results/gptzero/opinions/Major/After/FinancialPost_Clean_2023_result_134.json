            "inputText": "By Ian IrvineCanadian smokers have been staring at warning labels on their cigarette packs for more than half a century. And while these labels have metastasized in size and grotesqueness over the years, millions of smokers still haven't kicked the habit. Now Health Canada thinks one more warning will finally do the trick.Starting next year, printed slogans such as \"Poison in every puff\" will be required on each and every cigarette. Canada is the first country to make such a move. Carolyn Bennett, federal minister for mental health and addictions when the new policy was announced, called it a \"bold step.\" Such confidence seems misplaced.Two out-of-date impulses define ongoing federal efforts to convince Canadians to give up smoking. One is a view of smokers as misguided consumers who can be hectored into quitting if presented with a sufficiently stern and unmissable message. The other is a desire to destroy the legal tobacco industry by any means possible. Both impede efforts to improve the health of smokers.Fact: most of the toxins and carcinogens associated with smoking are the result of tobacco combustion. Fact: most smokers are not willfully destructive or stupid; rather they crave nicotine to satisfy a powerful addiction. Put these two facts together and it follows that our public health goal should be to separate nicotine consumption from tobacco combustion.\"When nicotine is decoupled from the deadly toxins in inhaled smoke, it is substantially less harmful,\" states a 2018 study in the Annual Review of Public Health(https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040617-013849). Its conclusion: \"Alternative nicotine delivery systems may provide a means to compete with, and even replace, combusted cigarette use, saving more lives more rapidly than previously possible.\" The \"alternative nicotine delivery systems\" referred to are vaping devices, e-cigarettes, snus (a variety of snuff) and other non-combustible tobacco products.If smokers can be encouraged to switch to these lower-risk products, national aggregate health outcomes will be vastly improved. The problem is that encouraging such a shift requires a big change in cultural norms and Canadian public health policy. And that seems beyond the ability of the federal Liberals.Surveys suggest most smokers are unaware of the relative risks of consuming nicotine in different forms. An even bigger problem is that a majority of doctors seem similarly misinformed. A poll of over 1,000 U.S. doctors(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8642586/pdf/11606_2020_Article_6172.pdf) published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine in 2020 found a stunning 80 per cent of physicians thought nicotine directly causes cancer. It does not.Adding to the confusion, many anti-tobacco advocacy groups vociferously argue against lower-risk alternative nicotine devices. The Heart &; Stroke Foundation(https://www.heartandstroke.ca/articles/vaping-what-you-need-to-know), for example, calls vaping \"a public health nightmare.\" Such views impede efforts to convince smokers to shift away from cigarettes. The same goes for provincial regulations, municipal bylaws and corporate policies that conflate smoking with vaping, as witnessed by the proliferation of \"No Smoking, No Vaping\" signs in public spaces, stores and elsewhere.The other big problem lies in the near-religious fervour with which governments and the public health community seek to destroy the legal cigarette industry in this country. There is no doubt that Big Tobacco is responsible for the premature deaths of countless Canadians over many decades. But the arrival of new, lower-risk nicotine delivery systems means attitudes need to evolve. Rather than crushing Big Tobacco with lawsuits, new regulations and ever-higher taxes, it would make more sense to allow it to transform itself into Big Nicotine and join the campaign to turn smokers into vapers. Plus, traditional cigarette manufacturers account for only a small portion of the vaping sector, which is dominated by new, smaller firms.But old animosities die hard. The Canadian Public Health Association, for example, forbids representatives from the nicotine industry or individuals who have had any professional relationship with that industry - including doctors - from registering at their conferences or even listening to what its members promote. By financially supporting these conferences, Health Canada is giving its tacit approval to such policies. This does more harm than good, especially considering the vast level of ignorance and disinformation in the advocacy and medical communities as well as the public at large.Even if the legal tobacco industry were eliminated, that would not put an end to smoking or nicotine addiction. It would simply force smokers into the black market(https://c2cjournal.ca/2023/06/best-friends-forever-how-ottawas-payday-loan-crackdown-will-help-canadas-black-market/), which now supplies an estimated one-third of all cigarettes in Canada and shows no regard for anyone's health.As an alternative to Ottawa's blinkered approach to tobacco policy, consider recent events in the U.K. Last year, a major report on tobacco policy declared that \"The government must embrace the promotion of vaping as an effective tool to help people to quit smoking tobacco.\"Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government has since turned this advice into active policy with its \"Swap to Stop(https://www.euronews.com/2023/04/12/swap-to-stop-uk-launches-scheme-to-encourage-smokers-to-switch-to-e-cigarettes)\" program, under which a million vaping starter kits will be provided to smokers. That's right: the British government is giving away vaping devices.Progress in economics isn't like progress in vaccines but it helps(https://financialpost.com/opinion/progress-economics-vaccines-helps)Making supply management untouchable would be a big mistake(https://financialpost.com/opinion/supply-management-untouchable-big-mistake)Liberals turning grocery competitors into statist cartel(https://financialpost.com/opinion/liberals-grocery-competitors-statist-cartel)Backed by science and an understanding of basic human nature, this new British effort has a much better chance of improving the health of smokers than Canada's stale attempt at yet another warning label. It's time for Canadian smoking policy to listen to the science, not to mention good common sense.Ian Irvine is a professor of economics at Concordia University in Montreal.
