After Putin's attacks ground TANA's business to a halt, USAID helped it relocate to a safer area and acquire equipment so it could resume operations.Today, TANA has found a new niche developing window seals that are badly needed to repair damaged windows from Russia's constant shelling. USAID has supported over 20,000 small and medium sized enterprises like TANA to withstand Russia's brutal bombardments - businesses that employ millions of people and pay taxes that go directly to supporting the country's self defense.After investors pulled hundreds of millions of dollars from Ukraine in the first months of the war, we also started working with the Ukrainian government to match foreign financiers with Ukrainian companies looking to attract funds.

These efforts are particularly critical for the agricultural sector that ships food to hungry communities in Africa and beyond, helping to keep prices stable amid the global food crisis.USAID has worked with private sector partners and other donors to build up alternative transport routes - via road, via rail, via river ports. We are providing equipment like grain elevators that speeds up the process of getting grain onto transport. We are helping Ukraine create and scale an app called E-Queue that reduces border wait times for trucks entering the EU from as long as two days to just two hours.This month, thanks to the buildup of these alternate routes and Ukraine's success in establishing a humanitarian corridor in the Black Sea, total food exports nearly reached the average levels they were at before Putin's full-scale invasion began. And we are helping upgrade border crossing points to export more grain in years to come. Improvements to the first nine border crossing points will increase grain export capacity by an estimated 2.5 million metric tons, meaning our one-time investment of $115 million should boost exports by at least $425 million a year. As new export routes like these expand, the World Bankpredictsthat Ukraine's total exports will grow by 15% next year, and 30% the year after that.And to keep corruption from sapping resources that should be going to the Ukrainian people, we're conducting an unprecedented level of oversight on our budgetary support - working with the World Bank to provide funds on a reimbursement basis, only after expenses have been verified; enlisting Deloitte as a third party monitor; and working with KPMG to conduct a comprehensive audit of US assistance dollars, while also building Ukraine's capacity to conduct its own audits through a partnership with the US Government Accountability Office.We have also invested heavily in strengthening independent anti-corruption institutions, media, and civil society to help root out corruption more broadly-vital not only to secure the integrity of our assistance, but also to give foreign companies more confidence that their investments will be secure. The Ukrainian government told USAID that it has saved nearly $9 billion, thanks to work we've done together since 2016 to build a more open, transparent, and competitive procurement system. And recently, with our support, Ukraine launched a new platform for whistleblowers to anonymously report corruption while staying protected against retaliation.Without the additional resources President JoeBiden has requested from Congress, American economic support to the Ukrainian government will come to an end, and potentially so will the progress we are seeing.And because we have leveraged our support, with State Department data showing that every dollar in economic and development assistance from the US has drawn in $2 more from other donors, a halt to our funding would likely cause billions of dollars of support from multilateral organizations and allies to dry up as well. A Ukrainian economic collapse would be every bit as devastating as the fall of Kyiv would have been in the early days of the war.The US cannot surrender in the battle for Ukraine's economy. Putin's victory would be a danger to us all, and it makes no sense to give up on a strategy that is working. If we can continue our work, Ukraine will continue on its path toward self-sufficiency - and emerge from the conflict with a growing economy, one that is thoroughly integrated with its European neighbors and that offers Ukrainians the prosperous, democratic and independent future they deserve.Opinion by Samantha PowerTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
