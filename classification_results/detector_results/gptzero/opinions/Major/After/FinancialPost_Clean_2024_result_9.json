And it wasn't just any vacation: they stayed at a 5,000-square-foot villa, with six bedrooms and a private swimming pool just steps away from a private, secluded beach. The villa was staffed by a cook, housekeepers and butlers.Mr. Trudeau didn't have to pay a cent: the resort is owned by Peter Green, a longtime friend of Trudeau's late father, and was provided at no cost. Had the prime minister been charged the going rate, he would have paid about $84,000 for the nine-day stay. While no one begrudges a hard-working Canadian a Christmas vacation to escape the cold and snow, Mr. Trudeau is an employee of the federal government, and so the tax question is whether he received the $84,000 as a taxable employment benefit.Under our tax act, employees are taxed on the value of almost all employment benefits. For example, if you attend your employer's holiday party and the employer's cost is more than $150 a person, you are taxed on the entire amount, whether you wanted to attend or not. So is Mr. Trudeau taxable on the $84,000?He's not employed by Peter Green, of course. But that's not actually relevant. An employment benefit is taxable whether provided by an employer or a third party, a fact the tax authorities have confirmed time and time again. In 1968, for example, Canada's Exchequer Court considered a situation where an employee and his wife received an expense-paid vacation - a Caribbean cruise arranged and paid for by a supplier of the man's employer. The court decided that the entire cost of the vacation - a cost of $1,384 at the time, which is about $13,400 in 2023 dollars - was a taxable employment benefit.The Supreme Court has said that, to be taxable, a payment does not have to be for specific services: the test is simply whether there is some connection between the payment and the recipient's employment status. In Trudeau's case, the question is whether the vacations were given in his capacity as prime minister, with the transferor expecting something in return - in which case the benefits are taxable. The other possibility is that the vacations were personal, tax-free gifts, with the transferor having no expectation of receiving anything back.In 2016, the Trudeau family enjoyed a Christmas vacation at a private island in the Bahamas as a guest of the billionaire Aga Khan. The vacation cost Canadian taxpayers more than $215,000.The Aga Khan Foundation Canada had received nearly $330 million in grants from the federal government since 1981, and the foundation was registered to lobby the Office of the Prime Minister. In 2017, the late Mary Dawson, Canada's smart and accomplished ethics commissioner, issued a 74-page report concluding that Trudeau had contravened conflict-of-interest rules when he accepted the free vacation, and stating the vacation \"might reasonably be seen to have been given to influence Mr. Trudeau.\"The issue went further than a slap on the wrist from the commissioner. It was reported(https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/conservatives-demand-to-know-if-trudeau-used-loophole-to-avoid-fraud-charges) that the RCMP considered pursuing criminal fraud charges against the prime minister, but ultimately decided to drop the case.Under Canadian tax rules, an amount is not a gift if there are strings attached. Given the fact that the commissioner concluded the vacation was meant to influence Mr. Trudeau, its value was almost certainly a taxable employment benefit, not a gift. Whether Mr. Trudeau paid tax on the benefit is not known.The proper characterization of Trudeau's most recent family vacation in Jamaica is not as clear. Peter Green is a resident of Bermuda and has few ties to Canada. There seems to be little he could expect to receive in return for his generosity (apart from some free publicity that might attract a few more paying customers to his resort).All Friedmanites now? If only!(https://financialpost.com/opinion/william-watson-all-friedmanites-now-if-only)Milton Friedman, keeper of the conservative flame(https://financialpost.com/opinion/milton-friedman-keeper-conservative-flame)Better start hoarding Pepsi and Frito-Lays(https://financialpost.com/opinion/better-start-hoarding-pepsi-frito-lays)If your high school buddies invite you to their Muskoka cottage for the Canada Day weekend to barbecue hamburgers and enjoy the fireworks, you know the stay is not taxable because it has nothing to do with your employment. Perhaps the same conclusion applies in the case of Trudeau's Jamaican vacation, notwithstanding the opulent locale. We don't have enough of the facts to know.Unless Trudeau declares a taxable benefit for the getaway on his personal tax return, Revenue Canada should complete an audit and come to its own conclusion.Allan Lanthier, retired partner of an international accounting firm, has been an adviser to both the Department of Finance and the Canada Revenue Agency.Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the business news you need to know - add financialpost.com(https://financialpost.com/ ) to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here(https://financialpost.com/newsletters/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2024 Postmedia Network Inc.
