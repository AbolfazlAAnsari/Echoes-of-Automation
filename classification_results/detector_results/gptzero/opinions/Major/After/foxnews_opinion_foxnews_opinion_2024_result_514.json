What a coincidence.Incredibly, Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro have both been sentenced to jail time on contempt of Congress charges, having refused to testify before the January 6 Committee. Incredibly, because in the history of our nation, they are among the very few who have actually been sentenced to serve time for that crime.BIDEN URGES RESPECT FOR LEGAL SYSTEM AFTER TRUMP CONVICTION WHILE PUBLICLY FLOUTING SCOTUS RULINGSBoth have appealed their cases, with Navarro, the first White House official ever to be imprisoned for contempt, arguing that the case against him represented an \"unprecedented assault on the constitutional separation of powers.\"Some may remember that duringBarack Obama’s presidency, Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress by a bipartisan vote for withholding information about Operation Fast and Furious, a gun-trafficking investigation that resulted in the deaths of several Americans. Because his department would not likely pursue legal charges against him, it was a show-vote that went nowhere.Contempt charges are threatened in order to force people to appear before Congressional committees; they are not used to lock people up…until now, underJoe Biden.Elsewhere, Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the FBI to crack down on what education authorities dubbed \"domestic terrorism\", but was actually a grass-roots movement of parents protesting COVID rules that impacted their children’s schooling. Republicans in Congress were furious at what some called the DOJ’s intimidation tactics after dozens of parents were investigated.DOJ'S OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL TAKES HEAT FOR ALLEGEDLY 'TARGETING POLITICAL OPPONENTS'Biden’s DOJ has also been investigating and spying on traditional (conservative) Catholics. Areport from the House Judiciary Committeestates that in the notorious Richmond memorandum, brought to Congress’ attention in 2023 by whistleblowers, \"the FBI singled out Americans who are pro-life, pro-family, and support the biological basis for sex and gender distinction as potential domestic terrorists.\" Was the effort justified? No, it was political.  The [FBI] memorandum recognized ‘the run-up to the next general election cycle’ as a key time frame and cited the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision that overturned Roe v. Wade as a flash point.\"Just recently, 75-year-old Paulette Harlow was sentenced to 24 months in jail for blocking access to an abortion clinic; when her husband pleaded for mercy, the judge mocked Paulette’s Catholicism. Harlow is just the latest pro-life advocate to be jailed by Biden’s DOJ for protesting near and in some cases blocking access to abortion clinics, accused of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or FACE Act.  Meanwhile, following the overturning of Roe by theSupreme Courtthe House Judiciary Committee reported at least 87 attacks against pregnancy resource centers and 152 attacks on Catholic churches. Only four people were indicted for violence in connection with these attacks, which also violate the FACE Act.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONMillions of voters believe that  – yes – there are two systems of justice. In 2022, the Federal Election Commission fined presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee over $100,000 for lying about payments made to finance the fraudulent Steele Dossier, used to discredit Donald Trump during the 2016 election. Politico reports the FEC found \"probable cause to believe\" that both the campaign and national party \"misreport[ed] the purpose of certain disbursements\" when they claimed the funds paid to the Democratic law firm Perkins Coie were legal expenses, when some of the money actually went to \"paying Fusion GPS through Perkins Coie to conduct opposition research on Donald Trump.\"Neither Clinton nor the DNC officials involved was ever tried for this financial and political hooliganism, for deceiving the public and using lies to subvert the election. Trump has just been convicted for arguably less fraudulent behavior.Similarly, former President Trump has been indicted for mishandling secret documents, while Joe Biden, who also kept classified materials, was let off by dint of being an old man with \"diminished faculties.\"  Remember that Attorney General Merrick Garland actually concealed the discovery of Biden’s wrong-doing, which occurred six days before the midterm elections, until after that crucial vote. The discovery was embarrassing sinceBiden had slammed Trumpweeks earlier for his \"irresponsible\" handling of the nation’s secrets.Call me crazy, but that looks like election interference.Donald Trump recently said, \"They’re not after me, they’re after you, and I just happen to be standing in the way.\"Very true.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEKGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
