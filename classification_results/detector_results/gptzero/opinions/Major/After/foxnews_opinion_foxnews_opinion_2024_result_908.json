The Select Subcommitteeuncoveredemails showing that Stanford University set up something called the Election Integrity Partnership in the summer of 2020 \"at the request of\" the Department of Homeland Security. This partnership submittedthousands of postsdirectly to Big Tech to be censored in the lead-up to the 2020 election, including true information, jokes, and even speech by Members of Congress.As concerning as this all is, what comes next is even scarier. The government has now turned its attention to supercharging the censorship process by funding the development of AI-powered tools to do it at scale.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONOurlatest reportrevealed how the National Science Foundation issued multi-million-dollar grants to university and non-profit research teams to develop AI-powered censorship and propaganda tools to combat alleged misinformation. One NSF-funded research team said the quiet part out loud when ittoldNSF that its AI-powered tool could help social media platforms more comprehensively enforce their misinformation policies and thus \"externaliz[e] the difficult responsibility of censorship.\" Non-publicdocumentsalso reveal the condescending way the censors privately talk about Americans, particularly military families, the elderly, rural and indigenous communities, and Americans who hold the \"the Bible and the Constitution\" as \"sacred.\"We’ve made incredible progress fighting government-induced censorship over the past year. Americans today can search onour websiteto see if they were one of the thousands of victims of the censorship-industrial complex. We owe tremendous gratitude to the many Democrats, progressive journalists, and other left-of-center witnesses who have bravely been willing to testify in front of the Select Subcommittee—even when facing baseless, personal attacks from Democrats on the Subcommittee.Our work is not finished. We will continue to press for information and reforms. The Select Subcommitteedefendedfree speech in an amicus brief in the landmark case currently before the Supreme Court. We attended oral arguments on Monday morning, where emails uncovered by the Select Subcommittee were discussed as evidence of government coercion.But no matter what the Court does, Congress must act. To that end, we have introduced theFree Speech Protection Actand theCensorship Accountability Act, which will hold federal employees accountable for violating Americans’ First Amendment rights. More legislative remedies will be introduced in the coming months.Our members understand the importance of this issue: if we lose our freedom of speech, our other cherishedFirst Amendmentrights—to practice our faith, to publish and report, to assemble peacefully, and to petition our government—are vulnerable too.
