Almost half a million children have already been exposed to educational tablets, and the goal is to extend adaptive learning on tablets to all 3.5 million children in the first four grades in this decade.Tablets are not the only way, however. India has embraced a cheaper, lower-tech solution in which schools shuffle students' classes for one hour each day so that all students go to the class that is at their actual learning level. This can certainly lead to awkward social interactions among children of different ages but because it needs no new technology it is also much cheaper. One year of this approach, research shows, has the learning equivalent of two years of normal schooling. Colombia is also piloting(https://palnetwork.org/english-es/kolibri-implementation-for-teacher-training-using-tarl/) this approach so as to improve literacy in low-income communities and rural schools.Getting government online is another way to raise efficiency dramatically. Research(https://copenhagenconsensus.com/ghana-priorities) involving the National Development Planning Commission in Ghana shows the power of digitization in streamlining bureaucracy and reducing both uncertainty and waiting times for citizens. Ghana's local governments, which are responsible for infrastructure and service delivery, still depend on central government transfers to fund their development, generating only about 20 per cent of their total budget with their own resources. Streamlined, digitized revenue collection has the potential to improve their autonomy. Digitizing property and business fees can make tax collection much more efficient, which can help municipalities provide the best possible services to citizens. Given the time and money saved, each dollar spent yields a return nearly nine times higher.Other countries are also prioritizing digitization, including through e-procurement - putting all their purchasing online. Governments are often the largest buyer in a country and procurement is often very corrupt, so transactions that are more transparent can deliver less corruption and more value for taxpayer's money. Brazil has shifted to an e-procurement system that has been recognized(https://www.ippa.org/IPPC4/Proceedings/05e-Procurement/Paper5-8.pdf) for reducing losses to bribery, while Indonesia's reform has led to a \"significant decrease(https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01900692.2022.2093900)\" in corruption. E-procurement was recently implemented in Ghana and is underway in Malawi.Immigration is all about freedom(https://financialpost.com/opinion/immigration-is-about-freedom)Canadians will ignore new trust reporting rules.

Instead of pretending to achieve everything for everyone by promising all good things, we need to shift to a sharper, smarter focus and start with the policies that offer the most bang for the buck.Kodjo E.
