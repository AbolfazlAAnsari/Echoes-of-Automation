These vulnerable people are being used as props in a series of cruel stunts to put blue states and cities on the spot, essentially telling them, if you're so compassionate, you take them. It's a despicable tactic to amplify right-wing panic messaging - and it's particularly sad to see it working in my own state of New York.In New York City, a metropolis built by and premised on welcoming immigrants, tens of thousands ofasylum-seekers have arrivedin the past year after crossing the southern border. Democratic Mayor Eric Adams responded by echoing right-wing talking points, complaining that \"the city is being destroyed,\" though he has at times hadsome kind wordsforasylum-seekers. At first he pinned the blame for the influx onSouthern Republican governorsand then shifted his anger tothe Biden administration, though he has also found himself struggling with post-Covid budget challenges.. He has beentrying to find waysto ship the newcomers around the state, shifting the burden to other municipalities, but officials across New York have essentially told him: Hell no.Long Island'sNassauandSuffolkCountiesare among the places that have declared emergencies or otherwise refused to help the relocation.Lawsuitshave been filed against New York City seeking to keep them out, andofficialshave threatened blockades. On Wednesday the Adams administration struck back in court, announcing thatit was suingmore than two dozen counties fortrying to blockits efforts to relocate migrants outside the city.One of the lawsuit's targets isRiverhead, on eastern Long Island, which has been in a quasi-lockdown since May 16. That's when Riverhead Supervisor Yvette Aguiar declared astate of emergency, using language that instead suggested a state of panic. Migrants are \"overwhelming the southern border,\" she wrote in her executive order. \"The Federal government has failed to defend the sovereignty of the Nation, resulting in thousands of migrants and asylum seekers crossing the U.S. border virtually unchecked.\"If any of those sovereignty-destroying migrants were headed her way, Aguiar was not going to let them topple Riverhead.Her order forbidsall hotels, motels, B&B's, inns, cottages, campgrounds - any conceivable temporary shelters - from taking in asylum-seekers.Yet the streets of Riverhead didn't look anything like a looming disaster area just days ago over Memorial Day weekend. Breezes rippled the streetlight banners bearing military portraits of hometown heroes. Folks puttered in the community garden. The Peconic River moseyed behind Main Street. The downtown atmosphere was one of mellow spring sunlight and business as usual.I asked Aguiar last Wednesday how she knew Riverhead was going to be a migrant dropoff spot. She said she had heard it from \"confidential\" sources she wouldn't identify, and also from the radio host Curtis Sliwa, whoseon-air and online rantingsabout migrant arrivals have been pouring gas on the fire for weeks. Sliwa has spun out an elaborate theory of a conspiracy among motel owners and slumlords, New York City politicians, even Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York's Catholic Archdiocese, to pull off a \"scam\" to profit from immigrant relocations.It's a drumbeat of paranoia and fear. Immigrants are coming to destroy your town. No one is welcome. Aguiar, who has roots in the Bronx andwhose parents came from Puerto Rico, says Riverhead has no room for displaced persons - not a single one. \"We need to take care of our own,\" she told me, drawing way too bright a line between us and them.New York, after all, has a long reputation for welcoming and absorbing newcomers. The city has a\"right to shelter\" lawthat requires the municipality to offer temporary quarters to people who would otherwise have to live on the street. Adams seems vexed by both of these things,presumablybecause New York has a lot of homelessness and unaffordable housing and sheltering poor people is expensive. New York is also one of many\"sanctuary cities\" that strictly limittheir cooperation with federal immigration enforcement - but now that a lot of people suddenly need that sanctuary, it seems nobody wants to supply it.New York's burst of xenophobia reflects an accumulation of misunderstandings and outright lies. Aguiar,Sliwaand others in the anti-migrant resistance have called the new arrivals \"illegal,\" though there isnothing illegalabout applying for asylum and living here while awaiting a court date. It's hard to see how people fleeing violence and instability in Central America and other troubled places - many of them mothers with young children - pose any credible danger. Fox News hyped (and later retracted) a despicable New York Post story about homeless veterans being forced out of hotels to make room for migrants. It wasa hoax.In a remarkable break from the general hysteria, Democrat Mark Poloncarz, the Erie County executive,declared last monththat his county had long welcomed refugees and would figure out how to handle any new arrivals, as it has for migrants from Afghanistan, Congo, Ecuador, Somalia, Ukraine, Venezuela and other troubled places.You would think any New Yorker in high office - not to mention a New York City mayor - would recognize that immigrants are a strength, an asset, a source of renewal - especially in Riverhead, home to adeep-rooted Polish community, many thrivingLatino-owned businessesand a Guatemalan consulate. Walk from the Polka Deli to Digger's Irish pub to Cielito Lindo taqueria to Haiku Sushi to Goldberg's Bagels, and you'll traverse less than half a mile of Main Street.Riverhead, a humble town tucked between the island's wealthy North and South Forks, would likely be struggling without immigrant labor. Long Island's immigrant communities and economic fortunes are inseparably intertwined -to the Island's benefit. Immigrant labor - by professionals, entrepreneurs, farmworkers and day laborers, among others - keeps the economy humming. According to theMigration Policy Institute, about 27% of New York State's 9.2 million employed workers are foreign-born. Nationally, the percentage of immigrants in the workforce reacheda record highlast year at 18.1%.Long Island has been an immigrant haven for decades.Tens of thousandsof Salvadorans fleeing a civil warresettled therein the 1980s. Earlier still, the children and grandchildren of immigrants found an escape from the slums of the city in new housing built there after World War II.Of course, this development also showcased the ways in which Long Island's streak of intolerance isn't new. The single-family subdivisions were oftenracially exclusive, though these second-generation Americans were willing to hire people of color to do work they didn't want to, as they continue to do today.Indeed, we have heard versions of toxic messaging in New York's White-flight suburbs for decades. Shame on every New Yorker who breathes new life into it and spreads it further. Sheltering migrants who are poor and pursuing their legal right to asylum can be a hassle. It costs money and uses resources. Ellis Island wasan expensive headache, too. Living up to principles is a challenge.
