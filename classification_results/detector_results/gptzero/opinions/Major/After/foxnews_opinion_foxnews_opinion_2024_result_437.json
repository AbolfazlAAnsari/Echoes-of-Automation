Habba called the $83 million judgment against Trump a \"violation of our justice system.\"(GWR/Star Max/GC Images)So there is an eerie feeling that theNew York legislaturemay have abruptly passed legislation that was aimed at the past conduct of Donald Trump but only after he entered the political arena.While these are not quite bills of attainder, there is something unsettling if they are post facto laws aimed at targeting the most famous and controversial man in America and the leading candidate for the presidency.In essence, they were targeted statutes designed to make Trump’s prior legally unactionable behavior suddenly quite legally actionable.TRUMP DEFENDS HIMSELF ON THE STAND, BLASTS E JEAN CARROLL TRIAL: 'THIS IS NOT AMERICA'Trump will be subject to such special treatment all summer and fall.Prosecutors Alvin Bragg, Letitia James, Jack Smith, and Fani Willis will synchronize their court business for maximum effect.Trump again will face left-wing big-cityprosecutors, judges, and juries on charges that are politically driven, involving alleged behavior that is either usually not criminalized or not to the same degree as in Trump’s case. (Do we remember the nearly $375,000 federal fine belatedly leveled at an exempt Obama but only five years after his 2008 efforts to avoid identifying all the names of contributors to his campaign?).The stakes are higher each day as Trump closes in on theRepublican presidential nominationand thus becomes the hope of half the country to end the Biden madness.Somehow, Trump will have to stay calm and give no opening to his legion of hostile prosecutors, all while conducting a nonstop campaign against Biden (and for a while, Haley), and while fighting to keep his name on various state ballots.So what we are witnessing is not even the extralegal efforts of Steele/Fusion GPS, Perkins Coie/DNC/Hillary Clinton in 2016, or the 2020 \"Russian disinformation\" ruse/change the voting laws/infuse half a billion dollars to absorb the work of the registrar machinations against Trump.We are way beyond all that. The legal system itself, hand-in-glove with left-wing politicos (compare campaign boasts of James and Willis, or prosecutorial visits to the January 6 committee and the White House) is turning the process of balloting and elections into an embarrassing farce.Still, Trump will have to soldier on. He must stay controlled amid the tsunamis, not play into the hands of his accusers, and remember that he may soon be the only eleventh-hour hope to stop this mockery of American law, customs and traditions.This op-ed was originally published on X and republished with permission, with edits for clarity.Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author most recently of \"The Dying Citizen.\""
