But it is up to the candidates to make their case as to why they are the best one for the job.Here’s a glimpse into what’s on my mind as we prepare to take thedebate stage:In the 1980 campaign, Ronald Reagan posed a fundamental question to the American people:\"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\"The resounding answer was no, they were not. Reagan went on to win that election, unseatingJimmy Carter. Four years later, President Reagan asked that same question when running for re-election and this time the American people responded with a resounding yes. He went on to trounce his Democratic challenger, winning 49 states for another term as president.BIG QUESTIONS FOR 2ND REPUBLICAN DEBATE CENTER AROUND 1 MAN, 1 WOMANFast forward. This week, President Biden broke another record. One that should not go unnoticed. The most telling statistic for me from recent polls is that a staggering 44% of Americans say they are NOT better off than they were four years ago, the worst result for any president in ABC/Post poll history. This is in line with ourlatest Fox News poll, which shows that only 35% of American voters approve of the way Biden is handling our economy.On Wednesday night, Republican candidates will share their vision for a brighter future, aiming to convince you, the American people, how they would make you better off than you are right now.I have always been one to strictly follow the rules, but sometimes the same can’t be said for presidentialcandidates on the debate stagewho are yearning for a breakout moment.FRAME THE DEBATE, WIN THE DEBATE: WHY WEDNESDAY'S REPUBLICAN DEBATE MATTERSOne crucial piece of advice I've shared with the candidates is that if they all talk over each other, the viewers at home won't be able to hear any of them. There's immense value in patiently listening and seizing the right moment to make a powerful point. Let's hope they keep this in mind tonight!It's essential to distinguish between what makes a good question for an interview and agood question for a debate.When a moderator asks a question that all the candidates agree on or one that's straightforward to answer, that's better suited for an interview format.In a debate, the aim is to showcase the contrasting ideas and opinions of the candidates.So, if you're watching from home and wondering why a specific topic wasn't brought up, remember that candidates will appear on Fox News to answer all your pressing questions.Big moments in a campaign are a fantastic way to bring people together and let them experience democracy in action.
