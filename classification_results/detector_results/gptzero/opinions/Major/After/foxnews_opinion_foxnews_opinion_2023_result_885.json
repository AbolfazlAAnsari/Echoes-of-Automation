ICE is the agency that detains violent criminal aliens and returns them to their home countries.  ICE is the agency that does the most to detercross-border crimeand illegal immigration by enforcing immigration law in the United States.Instead of protecting American communities, this provision would allow all past, present, or future ICE dollars to be used to buy airplane tickets and hotel rooms for illegal immigrants as they are permanently resettled across the United States. Airplane tickets that ICE had been buying to return violent criminal aliens to their home countries will be converted into airplane tickets to fly them to a community near you.Biden, serving as a Trojan Horse for the radical left and having set the stage for the abolition of ICE since taking office, is now using the chaos of a government-shutdown fight to sneak it across the finish line.Biden’s scheme would also specifically allow ICE’s remaining resources to be sent to sanctuary cities for resettlement.  These ICE taxpayer dollars will only add to the $104.6 million mountain of federal funds thatNew York Sen. Chuck Schumerand New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries slipped in earlier this year for New York City Mayor Eric Adams to resettle illegal aliens.Despite being among the most radical immigration proposals ever cooked up, Biden’s request has received little attention from major media outlets. How?Because the Democrat party has been hijacked by its radical wing, which has been setting the stage in plain sight, and without scrutiny from a compliant media, for a dramatic \"transformation\" like this since Biden took office.Immediately upon taking office, President Biden dismantled the commonsense border security measures put in place by the Trump administration. These actions included halting construction of the border wall, eliminating the \"Remain in Mexico\" or Migrant Protection Protocols,\" lifting prohibitions on sanctuary cities.  Biden has even proposed legislation granting U.S. citizenship to illegal immigrants.  He has removed enforcement and removal tools from law enforcement agents and blatantly disregarded requirements for detaining and removing criminal illegal immigrants in the United States.  All this while dramatically cutting the deportation of illegal aliens.In place of immigration enforcement measures, President Biden launched the Case Management Pilot Program (CMPP), which diverts funding from immigration law enforcement to provide \"services\" to \"noncitizens in removal proceedings.\" It’s managed by Church World Service, a left-wing organization that supported the \"Abolish ICE\" movement, a close cousin of the\"Defund the Police\" movement.Similarly, Biden secured record funding for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program – Humanitarian Relief (EFSP-H), which then used the good reputations of well-meaning charities to launder hundreds of millions of dollars—not just for food and shelter—but to purchase bus, train, and plane tickets to resettle illegal aliens throughout the United States.  One of the program’s only limitations was that aliens couldn’t be transportedby limousine.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONAddressing the record-shattering illegal immigration crisis that these measures unleashed, theBiden administration’s pending funding requestreplies: \"The Administration’s plan is working as intended.\" What’s the next step?Biden, serving as a Trojan Horse for the radical left and having set the stage for the abolition of ICE since taking office, is now using the chaos of a government-shutdown fight to sneak it across the finish line.As Democrats have learned from the \"Defund the Police\" movement, you need not alwaysliterallyeliminate the police. Sometimes, destroying morale and diverting funding away from law enforcement will do the job just as well.The White House took a page from this playbook and slipped it into draft legislation marketed as noncontroversial and routine. Just sign here, and the government won’t shut down.Biden is demanding the ability tototally neuter ICEin exchange for simply keeping the government open for several weeks. This is unthinkably radical brinkmanship and political exploitation.Ironically, these are the very words that Democrats will use against Republicans in the coming weeks as they try to lay blame for a possible government shutdown.So when President Biden, Chuck Schumer, andHakeem Jeffriesstraighten their ties, straighten their faces, look directly into the camera, and tell Americans that the radical Republicans should stop using a routine government funding bill to extract policy outcomes—and that they should instead agree to Democrats’ \"clean\" proposal—they ought to look in the mirror instead.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.
