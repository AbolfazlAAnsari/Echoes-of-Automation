Then, you can use that money to do something else you enjoy or leave that money to your heirs.Or, if you want to keep the collection, make sure you let your heirs know of its value by documenting what you have and leaving clear instructions on how to dispose of it after you pass. There are auction houses, dealers or other collectors that can help make sure it is placed with someone who values it appropriately.Put those instructions in your legacy and wishes planning system (like ourFuture Filesystem) to make sure your loved ones follow your own wishes for your collection and can receive an appropriate monetary value for the items.For other family heirlooms, do the same. And don’t have hurt feelings if something that has been in your family for generations doesn’t appeal to the younger generations. Let those items start a new life with a family who will treasure them and make their own set of good memories with them.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CAROL ROTHCarol Roth is a former investment banker, entrepreneur and author of the new book\"You Will Own Nothing\"Broadside Books.
