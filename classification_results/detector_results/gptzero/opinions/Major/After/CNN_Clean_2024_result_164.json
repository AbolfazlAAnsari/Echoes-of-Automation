It is centered on the story of my Ukrainian Jewish grandfather who'd kept a lifelong secret about his traumatic experience of WWII due to his fear of the Soviet government's persecution. I wanted to explore the role that fear and silence play in an authoritarian society, then and now.Having grown up with Russian history books that peddle a patriotic narrative, researching my novel taught me there were a lot of darker sides to Soviet history that had been hidden away. My grandpa's story was both unique and simultaneously one of millions of similar stories that could have combatted that revisionist history, but instead died with them. I dreamed of one day publishing the book in Russia and Ukraine because, I felt, most families there have kept similar secrets spawned by the Soviet culture of repression.I was editing the last chapter, when Putin ordered the invasion in February 2022, thereby giving my novel an eerier gravitas.As Russian tanks rolled through Ukraine, life quickly turned upside down. Most of my relatives - both in Russia and Ukraine - became refugees (some for the second time in just a decade), while my novel was acquired in several countries. Ironically, though, it won't be available in Ukraine or Russia: in Ukraine because they are busy fighting a war and don't want to read about one and in Russia because the novel counters several of Putin's laws.In light of all this, the invasion has forced me to rethink my own relationship to my two homelands. Though I'm not ethnically Russian, before the invasion I used to call myself RussianAmerican, a catchall moniker for all Soviet emigres (many of them Jewish, and many from Ukraine) that I had used since I had landed in the United States in the 1990s.But, unlike Putin, I can no longer hold on to the past. The world where Russia plays the role of the big sister to Ukraine has been shattered. Calling myself Russian now means feeling deeply ashamed for aiming to destroy a place that has every right to exist. It also means being afraid for what would happen to me if I ever stepped foot in Putin's version of backward-looking Russia.In the past two years, I've sometimes referred to myself as \"post-Soviet.\" As an identity that stems from the same past that Putin is trying to recreate, it's far from ideal. And so, now when people ask me where I'm from, I say I'm from Ukraine and Russia. I say I had family in both countries, but now they are scattered.I say this war will last forever unless we recognize where Putin is trying to lead us and stop him before it's too late.Opinion by Sasha VasilyukTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
