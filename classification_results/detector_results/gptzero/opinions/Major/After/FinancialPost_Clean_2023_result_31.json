One of the women who was with the former Marine quite incredibly posted the following message on her public Instagram account: \"I'd like to personally thank the country of Canada for an unforgettable and complimentary girls trip.\" She considers this event, one from which she suggests she has financially benefitted from, as a joke. Her travelling companion commented, further undermining their collective credibility, by posting a series of emojis which included two fists and ending with a bag of money. (The initial post was later removed for \"user safety purposes,\"(https://www.instagram.com/p/CoKTCn2ujfd/) but screenshots of the original exist.)Disorder in the court: What happens when scandal hits the Supreme Court of Canada(https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/supreme-court-canada-russell-brown-scanda-explainer)Michael Higgins: Why Canadians were never good enough for Justin Trudeau(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/michael-higgins-why-canadians-were-never-good-enough-for-justin-trudeau)The Judicial Council has had six weeks to review and investigate these petty \"allegations.\" Whatever more time and effort is required for the Council to conclude its investigation, that should no longer keep Justice Brown from returning to the bench where he belongs. The media must stop perpetuating falsehoods, and relying upon what Justice Peter Cory once characterized as \"an innuendo of suspicion.\"The facts, properly investigated and sensibly considered cannot possibly lead anyone to suggest that Justice Brown should be subject to discipline. The cases before the Supreme Court are obviously of national importance and the Court's rulings can set legal precedents that stand for decades. We are entitled to our full complement of justices to hear cases, participate in deliberations and to render judgments. The public interest is served by returning Justice Brown to the work he is eminently qualified to do.Brian Greenspan practices criminal law at Greenspan, Humphrey Weinstein LLP, Toronto, is the founding chair of the Canadian Council of Criminal Defence Lawyers and the recipient of an Honorary Doctor of Laws from the Law Society of Ontario.
