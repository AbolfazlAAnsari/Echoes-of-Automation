I hope these findings will prompt our society to radically rethink the way parents - but, let's face it, especially mothers - are instructed, judged and shamed for our parenting practices.The new research, published Wednesday in theJournal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, finds that children who have genetic predispositions for insomnia are more likely to have trouble falling asleep and tend to wake up more throughout the night.This makes perfect sense to me because, as a baby, my first child was a terrible sleeper. For the first several years of her life, it took her an incredibly long time to fall asleep, and she woke up regularly all night long. Reading this study, I have to wonder if maybe the reason was genetic.Of course, as a new mom, I was asked by everyone - pediatricians, family members, fellow mamas, strangers I passed on the sidewalk - how my baby was sleeping, and when I said it wasn't going well, I almost always got the same answer: I needed to try harder to sleep train her. The problem, most people seemed to assume, was that I wasn't tough enough to let her cry it out for a few nights until she got the hang of things.Sleep training - or letting a baby cry until they learn how to sleep - feels like the predominant advice given to parents these days, though there are alsoplenty of peoplewho will shame parents for doing so (of course).

This new study suggests it's possible that it wasn't my parenting after all - maybe my kid's genetics just make it difficult for her to sleep.There's a bigger lesson here that goes far beyond what parents should be taught about getting kids to sleep.
