He can then generate thousands of donations, mostly small ones to avoid raising any red flags, to multiple candidates, using real names and addresses of individuals without their knowledge.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONMiyares’s letter to ActBlue claims that \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" in contributions have been made through ActBlue in Virginia \"that are facially implausible and appear suspicious.\" \"Virginia donors,\" says Miyares, \"are reported as making multiple daily contributions…amounting to tens of thousands of dollars in aggregate.\" Yet many list their occupation as \"not employed\" or \"retired,\" and circumstances make it appear as if they \"are being made from fictional donors or dummy accounts\" and \"without the reported donors’ consent or awareness.\"Sen. Rubio has also questioned these transactions in a complaint letter to the FEC; specifically, the fact that ActBlue does not \"require CVV numbers as part of making an online transaction.\" CVV numbers are the three-digit \"card verification value\" numbers we all have on the back side of our credit cards that are used to verify the legitimacy of credit-card transactions. Rubio says that not requiring a CVV number amounts to \"an intentional lack of security engrained within\" ActBlue’s donation process.ActBlue has strenuously denied these charges both in a response to aninvestigationby the U.S. House Committee on Administration and toJason Miyares, who ActBluesaysis engaging is \"a partisan attack and scare tactic\" intended to undermine \"small-dollar\" Democrat donors.The only way to get to the truth is for these questionable donations to be investigated. That means both the FEC and the Justice Department – and state attorneys general under applicable state fraud laws – need to get busy, including talking to the donors listed in the filed reports to see if they actually made these donations and were not barred from making them.All of these law-enforcement agencies have an obligation to determine if there are \"Smurfs\" out there using money laundering to illegally interfere in our elections.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM HANS VON SPAKOVSKY"
