            "inputText": "When the COVID pandemic hit, the whole world urgently needed to buy protective gear, oxygen and ventilators. The countries that moved fastest and made the best spending decisions had electronic procurement systems in place. These systems not only help in a crisis but are crucial for reducing corruption and saving governments billions of dollars.How governments spend money is something most of us seldom consider. Yet this money adds up to a fortune. Governments are by far the largest buyers of goods and services from the private sector. Public procurement amounted to US$11 trillion in 2019. That's around 12 per cent of global GDP. In the countries where the poorer half of the world's population lives, procurement makes up an astounding one-half of all government expenditure.E-procurement speeds up this important spending, and speed is crucial in crises like COVID. In South Korea, introducing e-procurement meant the time to process bids was cut from an average of 30 hours to just two. In Argentina, the time saved in the average procurement was more than 11 days.But e-procurement does far more than just let governments move more quickly. It makes government spending less corrupt and more effective. This is crucial, because around the world corruption is a trillion-dollar problem(https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/05/1136282) each year, with very few answers. According to Transparency International(https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021), the world is doing just as poorly on corruption now as it was a decade ago.My think tank, the Copenhagen Consensus Center, has identified e-procurement as a key policy for the four-in-ten low-income governments that still haven't implemented it. Our research(https://copenhagenconsensus.com/halftime-sustainable-development-goals-2016-2030/e-government-procurement) on it is part of our multi-year project(https://copenhagenconsensus.com/halftime) working with dozens of the world's leading economists to identify the global best policies to speed up achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. These goals run from 2016 to 2030, so this year we are at halftime - yet we are failing on nearly every one. On the target of eliminating corruption, we are making zero progress at all.Because of its size, public procurement is one of the biggest corruption sources for every country, so introducing e-procurement can be a very effective way to tackle corruption. It can also end up making countries billions of dollars richer.Our research shows that over the first 12 years of designing, building and maintaining an e-procurement system, costs will average US$16.7 million, irrespective of a country's size. That's a trivial sum compared to most government budgets. And, as COVID showed, such systems have many benefits. E-procurement not only speeds up governments' ability to act, it also increases the number of bidders. The Indian state of Karnataka found that the number of suppliers increased from 130 to 4,800 in the first three years of e-procurement, while South Korea saw the number of bidders double from 70,000 to 147,000 over the same period.Transparent, widely accessible systems also enable governments to spend less on advertising for bids. The Indian state of Andhra Pradesh saved half a million U.S. dollars a year on advertising. The Philippine government saved US$9 million annually just on newspaper ads.There is also evidence that digitizing procurement means better oversight and improved service delivery. A good example is India, where there was a 12 per cent increase in road quality grade after shifting to an e-procurement system. Reforms in Paraguay reduced the percentage of contracting processes that needed amending from 19 per cent in 2013 to just three per cent in 2016.The most obvious, immediate and well-documented consequence is that e-procurement simply saves the government money. Our research shows that cost-cutting across all procurement averages 6.75 per cent. For the average low-income country, this means the benefits across the first 12 years amount to more than US$600 million. For each dollar spent, the low-income country realizes savings worth $38. For lower-middle income countries, the average benefits are more than US$5 billion over the first 12 years, meaning each dollar spent creates more than $300 of social benefits. This makes e-procurement an exceptionally effective policy.And it's not just during pandemics like COVID that an e-procurement system can show its true worth. Having an e-procurement system helped Ukraine's government to continue to function after the Russian invasion. Transparency International reported in March 2022 that \"the procurement system and all platforms continue to operate,\" even as much of the country was under attack.Dollarizing Argentina could reverse 'pink tide'(https://financialpost.com/opinion/dollarizing-argentina-reverse-pink-tide)Everything is tax-financed, union-produced in progressive heaven(https://financialpost.com/opinion/progressive-heaven-everything-tax-financed-union-produced)Alberta should take a 'random' walk out of the CPP(https://financialpost.com/opinion/alberta-random-walk-out-cpp)As many countries face threats that may require large-scale spending over short periods, e-procurement enables governments to respond more quickly and efficiently and with far less corruption. Introducing an e-procurement system is not only a proven way to cut waste and graft in public spending, but also to build resilience and be better prepared for the challenges ahead. It's a policy every country should pursue.Bjorn Lomborg, president of the Copenhagen Consensus, is a visiting fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.
