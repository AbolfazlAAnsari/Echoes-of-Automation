While the jurors are likely unaware of these facts, everyone \"around the table\" has controversial connections. Indeed, for many, the judge, prosecutors, and witnesses seem as random or coincidental as the cast from \"Ocean's Eleven.\" Let's look at three key things.First, there are the prosecutors. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg originally (as did his predecessor) rejected this ridiculous legal theory and further stated that he could not imagine ever bringing a case where he would call former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen, let alone make him the entirety of a prosecution.Bragg's suspension of the case led prosecutor Mark F. Pomerantz to resign. Pomerantz then wrote a book on the prosecution despite his colleagues objecting that he was undermining their work. Many of us viewed the book as unethical and unprofessional, but it worked. The pressure campaign forced Bragg to green-light the prosecution.Pomerantz also met with Cohen in pushing the case.Jurors may also suspect that there is more to meet the eye about the players themselves. While the jurors are likely unaware of these facts, everyone ‘around the table’ has controversial connections.Bragg then selected Matthew Colangelo to lead the case. Colangelo was third in command of the Justice Department and gave up that plum position to lead the case against Trump. Colangelo was also paid by the Democratic National Committee for \"political consulting.\" So a former high-ranking official in the Biden Justice Department and a past consultant to the DNC is leading the prosecution.Judge Juan Merchan has been criticized not only because he is a political donor toPresident Bidenbut his daughter is a high-ranking Democratic political operative who has raised millions in campaigns against Trump and the GOP. Merchan, however, was not randomly selected. He was specifically selected for the case due to his handling of an earlier Trump-related case.Michael Cohen's checkered history as a convicted, disbarred serial perjurer is well known. Now, Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., is under fire after disclosing that \"I have met with [Cohen] a number of times to prepare him.\"Goldman in turn paid Merchan’s daughter, Loren Merchan, more than $157,000 dollars for political consulting.Outside the courtroom, there is little effort to avoid or hide such conflicts. While Democrats would be outraged if the situation were flipped in a prosecution of Biden, thecross-pollination between the DOJ, DNC, and Democratic operatives is dismissed as irrelevant by many in the media.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONMoreover, there is little outrage inNew Yorkthat, in a presidential campaign where the weaponization of the legal system is a major issue, Trump is not allowed to discuss Cohen, Colangelo, or these conflicts. A New York Supreme Court judge is literally controlling what Trump can say in a presidential campaign about the alleged lawfare being waged against him.Michael Cohen testifies during former President Donald Trump's criminal trial on charges that he falsified business records to conceal money paid to silence porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016, in Manhattan state court in New York City, U.S. May 14, 2024 in this courtroom sketch.(REUTERS/Jane Rosenberg)The most striking aspect of these controversial associations is how little was done to avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interests. There were many judges available who were not donors or have children with such prominent political interests in the case. Bragg could have selected someone who was not imported by theBiden administrationor someone who had not been paid by the DNC.There was no concern over the obvious appearance of a politically motivated and stacked criminal case. Whether or not these figures are conflicted or compromised, no effort was taken to assure citizens that any such controversies are avoided in the selection of the key players in this case.What will be interesting is how the jury will react when, after casting its verdict, the members learn of these undisclosed associations. This entire production was constructed for their benefit to get them to convict Trump despite the absence of a clear crime or direct evidence.They were the marks and, like any good grift, the prosecutors were counting that their desire for a Trump conviction would blind them to the con.Bragg, Colangelo and others may be wrong. Putting aside the chance thatJudge Merchancould summon up the courage to end this case before it goes to the jury, the grift may have been a bit too obvious.New Yorkers are a curious breed. Yes, they overwhelmingly hate Trump, but they also universally hate being treated like chumps. When they get this case, they just might look around the table and decide that they are the suckers in a crooked game.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JONATHAN TURLEYJonathan Turley is a Fox News Media contributor and the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University. He is the author of \"The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage\" (Simon & Schuster, June 18, 2024).Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
