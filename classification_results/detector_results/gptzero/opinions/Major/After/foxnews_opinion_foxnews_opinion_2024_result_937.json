It will require the utmost grace to forgive Harry such blistering insults to Queen Camilla as he fired off in his biography, \"Spare,\" calling her \"dangerous,\" and \"a villain.\"As the Sussexes labor tirelessly to stay relevant, they have failed to impress or inspire by their own efforts. Absent ties to Harry’s family, there seems to be little interest in the former working royals. The pattern of their published attacks and betrayals of Harry’s family has been tamed by the distance finally imposed by the royal family, who have denied the Sussexes access by rightfullyevicting them last Marchfrom their only British residence, Frogmore Cottage.The Sussexes must be decisively forbidden any further exploitation of Harry’s family for personal gain, particularly at this trying moment for the king’s health. It will only be the best of outcomes if Harry's journey is purely out of sincere concern rather than opportunistic motives.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONDuchess of Sussex Meghan Markleshould be treated differently than her husband. While Harry must be given the benefit of the doubt expressing concern for his father’s health, Meghan’s history of seeking to damage the royal family renders her beyond redemption.The sudden visit has stirred a frenzy of public speculation. While some view his visit as a genuine expression of concern for his father's health, others, mindful of Harry and his wife’s checkered history, suspect ulterior motives, accusing him of seeking to redirect attention to himself.A new biography of Elizabeth and Prince Philip’s relationship by Majesty Magazine editor Ingrid Seward reveals Harry’s grandfather’s wariness of Markle. According to Seward, Philip nicknamed Markle \"DoW\" because he felt her capacity to harm the monarchy reminded him of the duchess of Windsor, whom the queen mother blamed for the 1936 abdication of King Edward VIII and the early death at 56 of Elizabeth’s father, George VI.The fallout of Meghan’s scheming, malevolent behavior, including the blockbuster Oprah interview in which Meghan suggested the royals were a racist family, ensured that Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip were denied the peace they so richly deserved in their final years. Harry’s grandfather’s comparison of Meghan to the infamous duchess of Windsor adds a peerless insight to the narrative, emphasizing the gravity of Markle’s transgressions.The irony is cruel. Charles waited a lifetime to be king, and only a year into his reign, faces his own mortality. The global concern expressed for his welfare, comes from every corner of the globe, including even both presumptive U.S. presidential candidates.The king has done a superb job during a tough first year,expressing sound, moral clarity,earning respect and affection at home and abroad. He has even found a way to use his health crisis as a means to help others to seek early diagnosis and treatment. Let us send him every good wish for a full and speedy recovery. May his days of convalescence be peaceful and, hope against hope, free of further Sussex psychodrama.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LEE COHENLee Cohen, a senior fellow of the Bow Group and the Bruges Group, was adviser on Great Britain to the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee and founded the Congressional United Kingdom Caucus."
