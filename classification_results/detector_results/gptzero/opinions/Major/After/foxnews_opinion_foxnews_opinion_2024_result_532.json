That’s basic psychology.The ICJ, ICC, Ireland, Norway and Spain are incentivizing continued attacks on the Jewish state and fueling antisemitism, and are not operating within the bounds of reality.The ICC was created to reign in rogue nations like Vladimir Putin’s Russia and bring about justice in ungoverned spaces. It is bound by the Rome statute, which includes the principle of complementarity. Complementarity limits ICC jurisdiction to situations when a nation is unable or unwilling to proceed with an investigation or if the investigation is conducted in bad faith.But with these arrest warrants, the ICC acted before Israel’s own judiciary, violating its own statute. Not only is Israel not a party to the ICC, but they have a long history as a functioning democracy with a robust, independent judiciary and military justice system.To put it plainly, Israel is not Russia, and Israel’s democratically elected leaders are not Hamas. The ICC should be applying for warrants to arrest despotic dictators such as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un – not the democratically elected prime minister and defense minister of Israel.Anti-Israel protesters rally outside of New York University’s campus in New York on Friday, May 3, 2024.(Rashid Umar Abbasi for Fox News Digital)Before the arrest warrants were announced, I was encouraged to hear that the ICC was going to visit Israel on May 20 to set up further meetings with the appropriate legal officials within Israel.But the scheduled meeting never happened, and the decision to apply for arrest warrants for the prime minister and the defense minister was announced on CNN without any consultation with Israel.It is clear now that the ICC never intended to cooperate with Israel and hear their side of the story as the CNN interview was taped before the meeting took place.The ICC has gone rogue.Meanwhile, Ireland, Norway and Spain’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state is appalling and dangerous, and it leaves several questions unanswered. What are the boundaries of the Palestinian state these countries recognized? What is its governing model? Who is the president? Is there a prime minister? Is it a democracy? Is it their policy to destroy the state of Israel the same as Hamas’?By unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state – without definition – these countries have thrown gasoline on the raging fire of antisemitism and made every problem in the Middle East worse.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONNow, Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran are emboldened. Bad actors in Russia, China and North Korea remain unchecked. And the radical ideology spreading across college campuses only continues.If there is anything positive, it is that there was swift andstrong bipartisan condemnationof the ICC’s action against Israel – from the U.S. president and secretary of State, to my colleagues in the capitol.It is now time for the United States Congress to go on record with sanctions against the ICC. If we don’t, we’re next.I will work with my Democrat and Republican colleagues to sanction the ICC and anyone who cooperates with them against Israel.Supporting Israel unequivocally is the United States’ best interest.We will fight back.It is time to stop the madness. Murderous, religiously fanatic terrorists are the problem, not Israel.CLICK HERE FOR MORE ON SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAMGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
