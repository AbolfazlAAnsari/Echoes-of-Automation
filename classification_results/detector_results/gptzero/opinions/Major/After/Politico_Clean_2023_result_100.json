The court did not address nor upset decades of established employment law, by which companies may use DEI programs to counter conspicuous racial or gender imbalances in their workforce, but may not use quotas or discriminate against individuals. As 21 Democratic state attorneys general clarified in their own letter to Fortune 100 CEOs, removing barriers to employment for historically underrepresented groups does not constitute racial discrimination. At their best, DEI programs help identify problems that have created racial and other disparities and develop strategies to redress them.How did JP Morgan increase its Black summer interns by two thirds, from 11 percent to 18 percent, in one year? Not with racial quotas - but with innovation that expanded possibilities for all kinds of people. Rather than continue to recruit primarily from the same 18 prestigious universities, they automated the first round of candidate interviews with a video software program that enabled them to consider more candidates than in the past. They also deployed a software program that objectively screened for cognitive skills and competencies for the role, rather than assuming such competency based on the school a candidate attended. And they created relationships to tap talent at historically Black colleges.That Republican AGs seemed most agitated by large banks' efforts to help Black people is telling and ironic. Black and Hispanic borrowers are often denied traditional mortgages while white borrowers with similar qualifications are accepted. Large financial institutions have preyed on Black and brown neighborhoods with subprime credit products, contributing to foreclosure crises and a widening Black-white wealth gap, itself born of intentional pro-white and anti-Black practices in credit, housing, employment and education.The GOP's answer to such racial realities is a formal color blindness that denies they exist and casts efforts to redress them as discrimination. Ever since Richard Nixon's embrace of a \"southern strategy\" to woo white voters by stoking resentment about Black people's civil rights gains, many politicians have pursued a divide-and-conquer politics suffused with white racial grievance, appeals to Christian nationalism and resistance to feminism. Lately that politics has devolved into autocratic meanness, with Republican-led legislatures passing laws to suppress democracy, control women's bodies, constrain LGBTQ rights, ban books and drag performances, prevent accurate teaching of racial history - and attack DEI programs.But diversity in America is a given and all institutions have to get better at cultivating successful shared cultures in which everyone feels valued, heard and represented. Pretending race is not relevant to that enterprise is as artificial as pretending that separate was equal for six decades. In a context of omnipresent demographic change and multiple existential challenges, the Republican Party, founded on an anti-slavery plank, offers culture-warring to distract from its anti-tax and anti-worker policies that largely make rich people richer.It doesn't have to be this way. I am a great granddaughter of a proud, Radical Republican who attended four Republican national conventions as a delegate. I married into a family of Black Republicans, a few card-carrying members of the NRA, but most of whom no longer vote for the GOP. I have been waiting for the day when this party might compete for our votes with a policy agenda of true freedom and opportunity for all. I am not holding my breath."
