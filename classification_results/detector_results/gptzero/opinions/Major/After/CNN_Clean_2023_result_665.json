She took a deduction for having her coach, Laurent Landi, standing nearby. Why was he there? Because it's the nuttiest vault ever, her scores are so high she has more than a few points to spare, and - wait for it - it helped her feel safe doing something that no other woman does. On Thursday, Biles, who has remained mostly evasive about future plans, told the Today Showthat competing in another Olympics in Paris in 2024 \"would be the path I would love to go.\"Maybe referee Barbie could see about changing those rules about spotting before that happens?Or maybe tennis star Coco Gauff, currently lighting up the US Open, could use some help from Coach Barbie so that she wouldn't have to tell the men in her players box, namely Brad Gilbert, to \"stop talking\" in the midst of her turning things around in her fourth-round match against Caroline Woznacki.  Gauff said later that she liked to \"think and figure out matches my own way,\" something pathbreaker Naomi Osaka has praised her for, seeing Gauff as \"a role model\" for her infant daughter because she is someone who speaks out.  And with the ability of coaches to now communicate with their players during matches from the courtside box, and the focus the coverage gives to those conversations, the narrative of women's tennis has a more distinct male voice, as the overwhelming majority of those coaches don't look like Coach Barbie.These moments exemplify how these athletes live in a world of contradictions and mixed messages, negotiating autonomy while trying to win. But if soaring ticket prices for Gauff's final against soon-to-be world number one Aryna Sabalenka (who clawed her way into the final against both Madison Keys and a very partisan New York crowd) are any indication, women's sports continue to be something of value, culturally, socially and - oh yes, go get that General Manager Barbie now! - economically. That said, Mattel may well sell more of those dolls than there are women in those respective positions, at least for now.Opinion by Amy BassTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
