In the US, there's apparently a young (also predominantly male) demographic that isembracing manualdriving - championing it as retro, much like Gen Z's affinity to typewriters and vintage cameras. They feel there's something authentic about it: a connection between driver and vehicle that automatization cuts out.They may not know it, but both these European connoisseurs and young Americans are of a mind with Robert M. Pirsig's protagonist in his classic 1970s philosophical novel,\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,\"who feels at one with his motorbike because he understands how it functions. Just pushing a button is a superficial copout.Well, Zen or not, the day of manual transmissions is speeding to an end - and this layman is shedding no tears.It's not just that I cringe at the grating screech of a botched downshift, that high-pitched sequel worse than fingernails across a chalkboard. The sound upbraids and shames me for having wronged the drivetrain. But this obviously never happens to alpha men, the kind who love their engines and coax them to purr.The superfluous clutchToday, however, there are knockout reasons - beyond the transmission's wellbeing - for the end of the stick shift era, and why we should applaud it, too.For one, the oft-repeated benefits of a stick shift over an automatic have been redundant now for years.Twentieth century wisdom was that because manuals had more gears than automatics - the latterusually just three- an adroit shifter with five on the floor could operate the engine more efficiently, and thus get more miles to the tankful.But technology has moved on and automatics with as many asninegears are common. And they chalk upbetter mileage and drive fasterthan their stick-shift counterparts. The explanation: automatics select the right gear for the vehicle, usually the highest gear possible. The average manual driver is not always so proficient. In getting the gear right, automatics consume less fuel, save money and emit fewer emissions.These are among the reasons why it's ever harder to buy a new manual-transmission model of any kind in many countries. In the US, less than 1% of new models have stick shifts (compared to 35% in 1980),according to the Environmental Protection Agency.It's really only sports cars, off-road truck SUVs and a handful of small pickups that still have clutches.In Europe, Volkswagenis dropping allof its manual-gearbox vehicles in order to comply withEU regulationsto reduce emissions.Gearboxes as such are outWhile all gasoline-run cars and trucks are climate killers with stick shifts being theslightly worse of two evils, combustion-engine automatics themselves are on their way out. They are tooling along the highway side-by-side with their stick-and-clutch counterparts toward the junkyard of history.Electric vehicles have gear systems, too: a single speed transmission that transmits energy from the motor to the wheels. But because only one gear exists, there is no switching of gears, neither automatically nor manually.For the gear-shifting self-appointed connoisseurs, the EVs' whoosh to higher speeds probably irks them even more than automatics. But fossil-fuel-burning engines of all kinds are on their way out - as a result of the climate crisis - and the sooner we're rid of them, the better.Road transportation accounts for 15% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, according toOur World Data, as well as being a huge contributor to the air pollution that claims aroundnine milliondeaths a year from respiratory and lung diseases.Transportation noise,though less deadly, also contributes to stress and sleep disorders.EVs to the rescueThankfully, there's a convenient way to circumvent these blights: electric vehicles.Last year, the sales of electrics tripled over the proceeding three years,according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).It added that if the trend continues - which hinges upon the rollout of charging stations - the EV revolution will save the planet five million barrels of oil a day by 2030.Positivesurveys seemto jibe with my own and friends' impressions of the ride one gets with the EV. It's quiet and as smooth as creme brulee. \"My husband and I actually fight over who's going to drive the EV to work,\" my friend Cristine in upstate New York told me. And my brother in San Francisco is into his fourth year of leasing an EV.In cities like Oslo, Norway, where new EV sales arethe rule rather than the exception, the air is cleaner, noise is less and overall emissions are down, too. So successful has the electric push been, Norway is ending the sale of gasoline cars in 2025.But for those aficionados who really can't go without a clutch and gear shifter, Toyota is planning arealistic-feeling fakemanual transmission for some EV models.It serves no purpose whatsoever - save to comfort bruised egos.Opinion by Paul HockenosTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
