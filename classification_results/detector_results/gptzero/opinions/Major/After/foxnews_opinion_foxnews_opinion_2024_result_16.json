If this sounds far-fetched, keep in mind that Facebook has already banned several Punjabi-American Sikhs from the platform specifically because of their racial and religious identity.To be clear, any of the Big Tech firms covered by the Texas law can choose to stop being common carriers whenever they like. All they would have to do is say that they are publishers, no different than newspaper or book editors and entirely protected by the First Amendment. Being a publisher, though, means accepting liability for the content on their sites.Of course, platforms like YouTube and Facebook know many of their users are uploading defamatory, fraudulent and even violent content, and they do not want to face any responsibility for that. Therefore, instead of choosing to be publishers, they are asking activist judges to let them enjoy all the benefits of being a common carrier (total immunity for customers’ conduct) while avoiding any of the responsibility (the obligation not to discriminate).The Fifth Circuit rightly rejected Big Tech’s laughable argument, saying that it was \"staggering\" for \"platforms [to] argue that buried somewhere in the person’s enumerated right to free speech lies a corporation’s unenumerated right to muzzle speech.\" Nevertheless, there is a genuinedanger that the Supreme Courtwill side with Big Tech and rewrite the Constitution to enshrine censorship.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONOne justice who is unlikely to join in such an effort is Justice Clarence Thomas. Many believe the Texas law was, in part, inspired by an opinion he wrote in 2021, where he remarked that \"[i]n many ways, digital platforms that hold themselves out to the public resemble traditional common carriers\" because they \"are at bottom communications networks, and they ‘carry’ information from one user to another.\"The New York Post's bombshell reporting during the 2020 presidential election was one of many topics heavily censored by Big Tech.(Getty images  |  New York Post)Justice Elena Kagan, an appointee of then-President Barack Obama, joined Thomas in contending (unsuccessfully) that the Texas law should have remained in place while the court decides its fate. A justice is unlikely to allow a law to go into effect if she believes that, on appeal, it will be ruled unconstitutional.While Kagan may surprise court observers by siding with Texans’ free speech rights, Justice Brett Kavanaugh remains an enigma. When he was a circuit court judge, Kavanaugh claimed some common carriers possess \"editorial discretion\" to censor in violation of federal law. If Kavanaugh still believes in this invisible \"editorial discretion\" loophole to duly enacted civil rights statutes, then he could well side with Big Tech against free speech.If Kavanaugh and four other justices take this drastic step, the ramifications for America will be devastating. Only once in history has the Supreme Court limited a common carrier law. That was in the now discredited Plessy v. Ferguson case, where the Supreme Court allowed a railroad to deny service to a Black man.Choosing to uphold Texas’s free speech law ought not to be difficult for the Supreme Court. Centuries of precedent reiterate that Americans’ fundamental liberties can be protected with common carrier laws. It would be much better for the justices to follow these rulings rather than create a new constitutional right for the world’s largest corporations to discriminate.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAN SCHNEIDERTim Kilcullen is counsel for investigations at the Media Research Center.Dan Schneider is vice president of MRC Free Speech AmericaGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
