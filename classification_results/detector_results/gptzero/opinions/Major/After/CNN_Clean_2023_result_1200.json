As a business strategy, it's logical, but it doesn't mean policymakers should play along.One of the most egregious examples of this thinking is \"Certificate of Need\" laws, a relic of the 1970s that require new health care facilities to obtain permission from state agencies, who areoften influencedby incumbent stakeholders, to open. As Aubrey Wursten of the Independent Women's Forum recentlyreported, only 15 states have fully repealed laws that restrict competition in health care in this way.There are other examples of policy-created impingements on allowing the health care market to work better. As policy analyst Robert Orrwrote, fears of a \"physician surplus\" lead to an artificial cap on medical school enrollments.In 2020, he found that \"the number of practicing physicians per person in the United States is lower than in just about any other developed country.\" On top of that, physicians groups like theAmerican Medical Associationlobby against laws that would allow nurses and physician's assistants to perform a wider array of routine tasks, ensuring less competition for these procedures.Policymakers should push for greater competition by allowing skilled nurses and physicians assistants to perform routine tasks, as well as exploring greater funding for seats in medical schools, revisiting the length and structure of medical schools or allowing more medical professionals from overseas to practice in the US.More recently, the Affordable Care Actaccelerateda growing wave of hospital consolidations and anti-competitive behavior from major health systems. Republicans, traditionally the party that tended to defer to big business, have increasingly signaled frustration at hospitals and doctors' groups they see as on the wrong side of Covid-19 policies and theculture war.Supporting efforts, likethe bipartisan legislationfrom Republican Reps. Michael Burgess from Texas, Drew Ferguson from Georgia, and Democratic Rep Debbie Dingell from Michigan to investigate the effects of these mergers should be an easy lift for many Republicans, even the most politically risk-averse ones.The second track where Republican health care policy thinking is developing is a long-term project. Arecent reportby the Washington-based consultancy Baron Public Affairs traces some of the health care ideas and principles percolating among the so-called \"New Right.\" As evidenced by Vance's interest in making childbirthmore affordable, younger and more ideologically flexible, Republicans are looking for ways to make health care more family-friendly.Their assessment of trends among younger conservatives suggests a growing realization that even with insurance, health care costs and complexity causes too many headaches for too many Americans. As the report notes, \"A straightforward step toward improving health care for workers and their families could be making the health care experience - especially billing and customer service - simpler and easier to understand.\"This would require more aggressive regulation and willingness to buck the interests of the health care industry than most elected Republicans have the stomach for now.Even some of the more modest pro-competition moves face the headwinds of a status quo bias and the unavoidable reality that major industry groups for policies that push costs upward without making health care better - and those groups tend to be generous campaign donors.America's convoluted system of health insurance and health care could stand a ground-up reform, but as the political backlash to the - in all, fairly modest - reforms in the Affordable Care Act suggest, that day will be a very long time coming.In the meantime, Republicans will suffer politically if they return to the messaging of repealing Obamacare. And more importantly, health care will continue to be an albatross around their neck if they aren't able to offer some solutions that can make finding and paying for health care less of a pain in the neck for individuals and families.Opinion by Patrick T.
