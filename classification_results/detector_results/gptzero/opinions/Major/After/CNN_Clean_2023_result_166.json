The 2016 election was aclose one.In the wake of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape of Trump proclaiming that he was free to sexually assault women, whichthreatened his candidacy, another disgraceful revelation could have altered the outcome of that contest -- and American history.The alleged election misconduct also seems like it might have been a gateway drug for Trump's even more extensiveattempted electoral tamperingwith respect to the 2020 contest.Nevertheless, the indictment has been greeted by decidedly mixed reactions -- including from some who are usually critical of the former president. They have argued that the hush money caseappears too political, it'stoo thornylegally and should have been brought by federal authorities -- ornot at all.There are a number of important critiques of the case in the furor and they are worthy of consideration. But ultimately, they are all wrong.Bragg's case is a strong one and should not be resisted merely because it involves a controversial political figure. Nothing is tougher than a legal imbroglio involving a president -- we know that better than anyone, from our experience with theinvestigations of President Richard NixonandTrumphimself. But that same experience has only reinforced what our experience with rogue presidents has taught us is the bedrock of our democracy: No president is above the law.Perhaps the single most repeated critique of the case by Trump and his allies is that the DA -- a Democrat -- is motivated by politics. Trump's lawyer Jim Trusty has argued for example that because Bragg discussed his experience investigating Trump during his campaign, this prosecution is \"not the rule of law\" and represents \"an upside-down world of criminal justice where we don't follow evidence.\"That's nonsense. There's no good reason to exempt Trump from prosecution when his former lawyer Michael Cohenwent to prisonfor his role in surreptitiouslymoving these fundsto benefit the campaign, as have others forsimilar conduct.The violation forfalsifying books and recordsis a clear one: These were alleged hush-money payments by Trump and his entities that they are accused of falsely entering into their records aslegal fees.New York law allows the elevation of the misdemeanor to a felony if the cover-up was to hide or advance another crime.

Our answer is that it takes time to charge a president, or even a former one.
