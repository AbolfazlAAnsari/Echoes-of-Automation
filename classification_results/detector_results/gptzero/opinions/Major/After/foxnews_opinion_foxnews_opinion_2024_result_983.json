Taking them at their word, a bipartisan group of lawmakers wrote a bill to both fund our allies and address border security.Here is where it becomes bizarre. Before they even read the new bill, Republicans reject it out of hand. Why? Because it includes provisions to address the border, it would have bipartisan support in the House, and the last thing Trump wants is progress with this issue before the November election.It gets worse. The Senate then passes a bipartisan foreign aid bill that removes border provisions, and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., refuses to bring it to the House floor because it doesn’t address the border. All this flip-flopping is enough to make your head spin.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONHouse Republicans are making it clear that they are not serious about governing and have no interest in pairing border security with assistance for our allies. Instead, they’d rather use the border as a political bludgeon.But our allies can’t wait – they’re depending on American leadership. We must send a message to the world that the U.S. stands for freedom and democracy and against tyranny and terror. It’s time for House Republicans to join us. Without further delay, we must work together to pass a critical aid package for our allies that includes humanitarian assistance for those affected by war.We risk emboldening our adversaries, starting with Eastern Europe. The most recent example is Alexei Navalny, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most ardent and vocal critic, who recently died while in the state’s custody. Regardless of the exact circumstances of his death, Putin is responsible.For too long, Republicans have dominated the conversation around immigration and the border, but it’s a new day. The New Democrat Coalition, a group of 100 center-left lawmakers dedicated to making tangible progress for our nation, has unveiled a 10-pointframeworkfor practical bipartisan immigration reform, and call on Republicans to join us at the negotiating table.We are dedicated to protecting our national security, both by restoring order at the border and by supporting our allies. But the ideal path forward is a bi-partisan one. At this critical moment, both sides of the aisle must come together so Americans can trust their government to deliver, and so the world can trust us to stand firm by our commitments.We call on Speaker Johnson and House Republican leadership to honor their oath of office and put the American people and our allies above politics.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MARILYN STRICKLANDMarilyn Strickland represents the 10th Congressional District of Washington state, and is chair of the New Democrat Coalition’s National Security Task Force.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
