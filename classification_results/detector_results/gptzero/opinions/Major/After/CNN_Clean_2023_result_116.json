In 1976, Congress re-designated the area explicitly for environmentally responsible resource development. That occurs based on sound science and the best available technology, and is carried out in careful balance with the subsistence and economic needs of Alaska Native communities on our North Slope.The project's developer, ConocoPhillips, says it has paid approximately $120 million to the federal government for lease acquisition and rental costs, which itstarted to acquireduring the Clinton-Gore administration. After a decade of preliminary environmental studies, the company listened as the Obama-Biden administrationurged developmentin the petroleum reserve andultimately appliedto develop Willow in 2018.More than five years later, after several rounds of environmental analysis, career civil servants at the Bureau of Land Managementhave recommendedWillow's approval with some modifications to reduce the project size and footprint.Now, the question is whether the Biden-Harris administration recognizes that Willow will dramatically benefit the Alaska Native people who live on the North Slope, our state's stagnant economy and our nation's energy security - allwhile creatinghundreds of permanent jobs and thousands of temporary ones, andgenerating fewer emissionsthan imported oil.This should be an easy decision. The administration hasmade combatingclimate change a priority, whilealso acknowledgingthat the transition to cleaner energy will take time. In the meantime, we need oil, and compared to the other countries we can source it from, we believe Willow is by far the most environmentally responsible choice.In total, the Bureau of Land Management's preferred project will impactjust 429 acres, which is a tiny fraction of the 23-million-acre petroleum reserve. The Biden administration hasseparately blockedsurface development on 11 million acres of NPR-A, meaning that Alaskans are asking to develop an area of land 25,600 times smaller than what has been placed off limits.Willow is meticulously planned and will be developed safely. It will adhere to hundreds oflease stipulationsand best practices - including theuse of ice roadsandunderground extended reach drilling-  to minimize impacts.Despite its small size, the project will still deliver immense benefits. According to ConocoPhillips, itwill provide2,500 construction jobs, 75% of which will be union jobs. According to theBureau of Land Management's estimates, the government revenues it generates over the life of the project,up to $17 billion, will be split among the federal government, the state of Alaska and indigenous North Slope communities - helping to pay for roads, schools, medical clinics and basic infrastructure, and potentially contributing tofurther gainsin the life expectancy of Alaska Natives.Because of its small footprint and enormous benefits, many indigenous subsistence hunters and whalers in the region strongly support Willow. North Slope residents,primarily the Inupiaq people, have voiced their strong desire to see it move forward, as have theAlaska Federation of Natives, the bipartisan Alaska State Legislature, and state and national labor groups.The administration has madesocial justice and racial equitypriorities. There is no greater example than the indigenous population of the North Slopeasking for this economic developmentto benefit all their people through self-determination.Another reason to approve Willow is that it will boost our nation's energy security. We can learn not just from Europe's example with Russia but also from California, whichhas importedmore as Alaska's production has declined. California's recent actions - importing from Saudi Arabia, then Russia, and most recently from countriesdrilling in the Amazon rainforest- are a recipe for the empowerment of OPEC+ and needless environmental devastation beyond our borders.The reality, as President Joe Biden has acknowledged, is that the world will need oil for some time to come. Even under best case net-zero emission scenarios, the world isprojected to use75 million barrels per day in 2030 and nearly 23 million barrels per day in 2050.If Willow is rejected, emissions won't magically go down. That's because the US will have to import more oil from elsewhere - like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia - at higher cost, with greater environmental impact, and at untold risk to our national security. This is clearly reflected in the Department of Interior'senvironmental assessment.The reapproval of Willow is not a violation of President Biden'spledge to restrictnew oil leasing, either. The projectwas already approvedwhen he took office. Its reapproval, following a lawsuit, would help signal the administration is serious about both climate and energy policy, understands Alaska's economic needs and has heard the vast majority who support it.Alaskans are not ignorant about our changing climate. We are on the front lines and see the impacts every day. Still, we know that clean energy cannot manifest overnight. We have to work our way there.As we do, we must prioritize American energy to meet our continuing needs. There's no better way to do that than through oil responsibly produced from a petroleum reserve in Alaska, with a small environmental footprint, that significantly benefits the people who live there and support it as well as the rest of our great nation.We hope President Biden and his team agree.Opinion by Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan and Mary PeltolaTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
