            "inputText": "Being finance minister in the Trudeau government is not easy. Ottawa has already added more than $600 billion in new net debt since Mr. Trudeau came to power, and new spending commitments on housing, defence, and social programs will add billions to deficits for years to come. Meanwhile, interest charges on the federal debt will reach $40 billion this year for the first time since the \"bad old days\" of the Chr√©tien government.If the government can't control spending, and if taking on even more government debt is a bad idea, then one choice remains: taxes have to go up. On Tuesday, Chrystia Freeland announced her plan to increase taxes on capital gains for the wealthiest Canadians. That will help stanch the flow of red ink in Ottawa, adding an estimated $3 billion a year in new revenues. Provincial revenues will rise too, by something like $1 billion or more.Capital gains are income flows that result from the rise in value of corporate shares and other assets. Since 2001, only half of realized gains have been taxed. In the 1990s, three-quarters were. Before then the \"inclusion rate\" varied between zero, one-half and two-thirds. The effect of the current 50 per cent rate is to make the maximum tax rate on gains only about 26 per cent.Under Freeland's plan, the effective rate will rise to two-thirds, but only on capital gains over $250,000 per year. At the same time, the lifetime exemption for gains on small businesses will increase to $1.25 million and be indexed to inflation. These changes will help fix a loophole in our existing system that benefits the wealthiest among us(https://financesofthenation.ca/2023/04/04/a-capital-gains-tax-reform-simulation-model/). By my estimates, about 70 per cent of the new revenues will come from just 5000 Canadian families in the top 0.1 per cent, with average family incomes over $2.5 million a year. Like all of us, those families deserve to profit from their investments. But why should they pay a lower tax rate than many Canadians pay on their salaries or overtime pay?The Department of Finance says(https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/services/publications/federal-tax-expenditures/2020.html) that low capital gains taxes are meant \"to encourage or attract investment (and) to support competitiveness.\" But a tax provision that only domestic shareholders benefit from is unlikely to have much impact on investment in Canada's open economy(https://financesofthenation.ca/2020/11/19/the-taxation-of-capital-income-in-canada-part-ii-the-corporate-income-tax/).One common critique of capital gains taxes is that they discourage risky investments(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/economic-costs-of-capital-gains-taxes-in-canada-chpt.pdf). But economists have shown that a capital gains tax that treats losses and gains symmetrically should have no impact on risk taking. In most cases, losses can be used to offset other taxes, so investors who made bets that lost are not punished by our tax system.It's true that in addition to paying personal taxes on the income they receive from corporate shares, shareholders also effectively pay corporate taxes on the underlying earnings. But, even factoring in these corporate taxes(https://financesofthenation.ca/2021/01/07/its-time/), the effective rate on capital gains is still lower than on top labour incomes. It is also substantially lower than what shareholders pay if they take profits as dividends rather than capital gains, after accounting for the dividend tax credit. As a result, corporations have an incentive to reduce dividends and pay out earnings through share repurchases and corporate acquisitions that attract capital gains tax treatment. When business decisions are driven by tax planning considerations, that is never good for business productivity.For small businesses, the tax advantage for capital gains over dividends is even larger. And so, owners of small businesses have strong incentives to find ways to take their profits as capital gains rather than dividends or salaries, a strategy known as \"surplus stripping.\" Surplus stripping creates real economic costs. The expertise and resources that go into tax planning create no overall social benefit. Meanwhile, tax authorities must devote considerable resources to finding and eliminating novel tax shelters, leading to unneeded complexity in tax rules.The NDP has proposed a new tax on high-wealth Canadians(https://www.pbo-dpb.ca/en/publications/RP-2021-017-M--net-wealth-tax-canadian-resident-economic-families--impot-patrimoine-net-familles-economiques-residant-au-canada). That would be much worse for the economy than hiking capital gains taxes. It would have significant administrative costs and enforcement problems, and it would exacerbate inter-asset tax distortions(http://www.columbia.edu/~wk2110/bin/BPEASaezZucman.pdf), harming productivity.This federal budget is 'one of the worst in decades'(https://financialpost.com/opinion/chrystia-freeland-unaffordability-budget)Ben &; Jerry's woke chickens are coming home to roost(https://financialpost.com/opinion/ben-jerrys-woke-chickens-come-home-to-roost)In post-disaster rebuilding, government needs to get out of the way(https://financialpost.com/opinion/disaster-rebuilding-government-needs-to-get-out-of-the-way)The new, targeted increase in capital gains tax is a better way. It helps level the playing field for all investors, and that will boost productivity in the long run. And the extra revenues will help put Ottawa's finances back on a sound footing. The case for it seems clear.Financial PostMichael Smart teaches economics at the University of Toronto.Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the business news you need to know - add financialpost.com(https://financialpost.com/ ) to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here(https://financialpost.com/newsletters/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=¬© 2024 Postmedia Network Inc.
