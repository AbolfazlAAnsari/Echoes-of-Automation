With that coalition pushing for it, Netanyahubacked judicial-reform legislationthat later threatened to tear apart the country. And that was before the October 7 calamity.Now, it's time for Bibi, as he is known, to step down for the sake of the country.Maybe by voluntarily surrendering power, which undoubtedly would be painful for him, he can start scraping some of the thick tarnish off his legacy.The terms of the negotiations would be straight forward. Netanyahu should resign in exchange for immunity over thecriminal charges he facesfor fraud, breach of trust and bribery - all accusations he vehemently denies.Even before Hamas terrorists rampaged into Israel on October 7,massacringsome 1,200 people - the worst slaughter of Jewssince the Holocaust- kidnapping more than 240, and launching what looked like acalculated campaign of rape, mutilation and sexual violence; even before what was unquestionably one of the worst days in Israeli history, Netanyahu had already created divisions in the country that were unprecedented since the founding of modern Israel.His agreement with theextremist legislatorsin his coalition - Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich - negotiated as a last-gasp effort to keep power and possibly stay out of jail, included a judicial overhaul proposal that would severelyundermine the power of the courts, opening a path to all manner of changes to the country's character.In total,hundreds of thousandstook to the streets, protesting week after week for eight months. The demonstrations ended only after Hamas attacked and attention turned to helping the families of hostages and the tens of thousands of Israelis evacuated from their homes.The longest-serving prime minister in Israel's history, Netanyahu could have walked away years ago with a respectable list ofaccomplishments. He had helped transformed tinyIsrael's economyinto a powerhouse, setting the stage for its emergence as one of the world's most resilient and innovating countries, atop incubatorof new technologies. And he presided over the end of the country's regional isolation, helping build ties between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors.Israelis were rightly proud of their accomplishments, and many did credit Netanyahu for his part in them.And yet, that was secondary. In Israel, arguably more than in any country on Earth, the absolute top priority is security. And there, Netanyahu failed catastrophically.He has also failed since October 7 in refusing to take responsibility for the disaster, repeatedly affirming, \"We're going to answerall these questions,\" about what went wrong. But now, \"Let's focus on victory.\"The fact that Netanyahu expects the reckoning to come after the war creates an incentive for him to prolong it. As Israel decides how to pursue the conflict with Hamas going forward, that's a conflict of interest that is unacceptable and dangerous.The Hamas attack has been a disaster for Netanyahu. A year-end poll by the Israel Democracy Institute foundonly 15% of Israelis want him to stay in officewhen the war ends. The favorite to take the job is Benny Ganz, the retired IDF general and a leading opposition figure before the Hamas assault, when he joined Netanyahu's emergency war cabinet.Netanyahu has no legitimacy to preside over the vital questions coming at Israel with relentless velocity.How long will Israeli forces stay in Gaza, and in what capacity? Who's going to govern the strip after the war ends? Will Israelis and Palestinians restart negotiations toward the creation of two states? Can Israel trust the Palestinian Authority and President Mahmoud Abbas - largelydistrusted by Palestinians- to help govern Gaza?What about Hezbollah in Lebanon? As the Iran-linked militia, far stronger than Hamas, continues firing into northern Israel, should Israel try to destroy the estimated200,000 rockets Hezbollah has aimed at Israel, or is it better to avoid opening a second front? Netanyahu's former strategy of allowing Hamas to stay in power proved disastrous; is that a lesson that should apply to Hezbollah?Then there's another crucial question about the character of Israel's democracy, a question that was only paused by the Hamas onslaught.The proposed judicial overhaul prompted huge numbers of Israelis to protest because they believed it would ultimately destroy Israeli democracy. On January 1, theIsraeli Supreme Court rejecteda key piece of that plan. The so-called \"reasonableness\" law, which banned the court from blocking legislation it viewed as too extreme, would have essentially given control of the two most powerful branches of government to the ruling parties.Israel's system, based on British common law, does not have a written constitution. It urgently needs one. The Court's decision was 8 to 7. That's a recipe for continuing constitutional crises in a country facing so many challenges.I happen to believe that one of the reasons Hamas attacked when it did is because it saw the depth of Israel's division.Israelis came together after the horrors of October 7, but they are under no illusion that the problems that existed before have suddenly vanished. Some have been postponed, but many more have come to the fore.Benjamin Netanyahu is the wrong man for the moment. He should walk away for the sake of Israel.Opinion by Frida GhitisTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
