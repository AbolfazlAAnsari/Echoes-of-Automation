There is no such thing as an illegal human. I am Kamala Harris. My pronouns are she and her and I'm a woman sitting at the table wearing a blue suit.Ahhh! But there's more than one kind of woke. If you define woke, it's someone who's awake, perhaps with an angrier consciousness. Of course, they have to share this newfound rage with everyone as they seek to infect every crevice of society with their unbridled ignorance. The woke had a few good years now to undo society, attacking traditional family structures, societal safety and security. But like Jamie Lissow at his own home, it's no longer welcome. And it's created a rebound woke which is come in the shape of something monstrous, powerful and really scary.

Oh, the things I did for money. But true moms are back belligerent and buzzed on watermelon margaritas. But first, let's look how the woke first targeted them. First, they said men can get pregnant. That's total B.S. I've tried many times. I just don't have the hips for it. The woke also maintain men can have periods, which is baloney, too. The closest I've come to having a period is spilling marinara on my khakis.University of Pennsylvania transgender athlete Lia Thomas swims in a preliminary heat for the 500 meter freestyle at the NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships Thursday, March 17, 2022, at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. ____ Transgender woman Lia Thomas (L) of the University of Pennsylvania stands on the podium after winning the 500-yard freestyle as other medalists (L-R) Emma Weyant, Erica Sullivan and Brooke Forde pose for a photo at the NCAA Division I Women's Swimming &amp; Diving Championshipon March 17, 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia.(AP Photo/John Bazemore  |   Justin Casterline/Getty Images)They also say men cancompete against your daughters in sports, but this apparently only goes one-way. Trans women can swim and wrestle. But good luck seeing trans men in the NBA. Follow the money and the trans experiment dries up like my elbows in January. Meanwhile, look at the biological man who barged into women's sports and women's locker rooms. That's masculinity more toxic than anything Kamala's husband can point to. And he lives with a cackling chemical spill.Third, they believe the relationship between mother and child could be intruded upon by a stranger and not even one in a van. It's one with an agenda under the guise of right to privacy, meaning you have no idea that a teacher fresh out of college who's soaked in oppression lingo and hair dye can imprinthis/hers/them/theyson your kids and parents shall not be informed. Right to privacy is code for 'don't tell Mom and Dad that for dodgeball we now throw ****.'They claim it takes a village to raise your child and they're just the village idiots to do it. And so wokeness became a political mutation of Munchhausen by proxy, where people suffering from a manufactured delusion transfer it onto children for attention, sympathy and now tenure.So I'm now non-binaryand you are too. I believe the planet is about to die and so shall you. I have more nose rings than a shower curtain. So shall you. I have more face piercings than someone who tried to commit suicide with buckshot.

And the newly infected has no immune system for it because it is a child. But there is an effective booster for it. It's called an angry mom, and it's perfect forfighting the wokeness.True, moms might make you cringe, but that's what moms do. But so do third-graders being forced to look at a drag queen's suspicious package. So this new woke are Republican moms, independent moms. And over time, more and more Democrat moms and some of these women, God forbid, have become governors.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, governor of Arkansas, speaks while unveiling the Arkansas LEARNS education bill at the Arkansas State Capitol in Little Rock, Arkansas, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2023.

It's all about practical concerns concerning a struggle, for the minds of their own children. That's worth waking up for. And our moms never let anybody sleep late. And these moms won't either.
