            "inputText": "A year later, the consequences for women have been alarming.Because Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that saluting the flag or reciting the Pledge of Allegiance amounts to worshiping secular authority, they prohibit their school-age children from engaging in the practice. In 1940, with war raging in Europe and patriotic fervor rising at home, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution provided no religious exemption from what many public schools deemed an essential civic duty. Thedecisionupheld a Pennsylvania school district’s expulsion of a Jehovah’s Witness brother and sister. A single member of the court dissented.A mere three years later, even though the United States itself was now at war, the court reversed itself. In a new flag-salute case from West Virginia, three members of the original majority switched sides and two justices who had joined the court since 1940 voted with them. One of those two, Robert Jackson, wrote the new majority opinion, strategically avoiding the contested question of religion in favor of an eloquent defense of free speech. “Compulsory unification of opinion achieves only the unanimity of the graveyard,” he wrote inWest Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette. The new decision vindicated the initial 8-to-1 ruling’s lone dissent by a vote of 6 to 3.Historians understand that what impelled such a stark reversal was the justices’ dismay at the violence and prejudice that the first decision, Minersville School District v. Gobitis, had unleashed; some people, and not only a few, had evidently taken the court as having labeled Jehovah’s Witnesses as un-American and disloyal. Mobs attacked individual Witnesses and destroyed their places of worship. More than 2,000 Witness children were thrown out of school, and some of their parents criminally prosecuted. The consequences of the decision were alarming, and the country paid close attention as the court took up the issue for reconsideration. The public relief that greeted the second decision was captured by Time magazine’s headline on its account of the ruling: “Blot Removed.”What brings this historical episode to mind is the approaching anniversary ofDobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the decision last June 24 that eradicated the constitutional right to abortion. About 40 percent of states have bans that make abortion illegal or functionally unavailable, though in some of those states the proscriptions have been blocked pending the outcome of court challenges. The crisis in reproductive health care that Dobbs propelled is acute and growing. There have been, in other words, alarming consequences.Areporttitled “Care Post-Roe: Documenting cases of poor-quality care since the Dobbs decision,” published in mid-May by teams of experts from the University of California at San Francisco and the University of Texas at Austin, documents the experience of health care providers in states that have banned or strictly limited abortion for women whose troubled pregnancies required medical intervention that the doctors felt unable to provide.The 24-page report consists largely of excerpts from submissions by 50 health care providers, many of whom felt, as one wrote, that “our hands are tied” as they waited anxiously for their patients’ conditions to deteriorate to the point where the pregnancy could be terminated within the narrow exceptions permitted by the state laws. When doctors turned women away, their next encounter was sometimes in the emergency room or intensive care unit as the patient lay bleeding or even near death. Sometimes doctors arranged to transfer their patients to other states, but this was not always possible and in any event consumed precious time. “This delay in care was a ‘near miss’ and increased morbidity,” one doctor wrote in a mixture of clinical and everyday speech.“It is important to note that these are not ‘one-off’ situations,” the report’s authors wrote. “Similar scenarios were reported in many of the states that have imposed new restrictions on abortion care since the Dobbs ruling.” This public health crisis makes no distinction on the basis of race or class; half the cases reported involved women who were nonwhite or primarily Spanish-speaking.And so the question: A year after sowing so much chaos and misery, are any of the five members in Justice Samuel Alito’s Dobbs majority sorry? Even a little? I’m not so naïve as to think there is even a slim chance they would reverse themselves. I just wonder whether they feel even a twinge of regret.Unlike the justices in 1940, these justices — Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh in addition to Alito — can’t claim surprise. Refusing to join the decision for Roe’s overruling, Chief Justice John Roberts warned in his separate opinion that the majority opinion would cause “a serious jolt to the legal system.” The Alito five would have known from reading the briefs that about a dozen states had enacted “trigger laws” designed to ban abortion as soon as the Supreme Court opened the gate. Valuing fetal life over the lives of women and girls was no doubt a feature, not a bug, in the majority’s view; that was, after all, the point of Dobbs.And Justice Alito himself was well aware of the pair of flag-salute cases. He invoked West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette in an effort to show that overruling precedent has a noble lineage. He fudged the point, however, in his bland description of what had impelled the court’s reversal in 1943, saying only that “Barnette stands out because nothing had changed during the intervening period other than the court’s belated recognition that its earlier decision had been seriously wrong.”For Barnette to be useful to Justice Alito, he had to make it stand for “nothing had changed” because during the 50 years between Roe v. Wade and Dobbs, nothing really did change. Nothing, that is, except the steady accumulation of justices put on the court by presidents who had pledged, in the Republican Party platform that all the party’s presidential candidates ran on from 1980 to 2020, to appoint judges and justices who would overturn Roe. Finally, on last June 24, there were enough of them.Another difference between Barnette and Dobbs is that the three justices who changed their minds after the first flag-salute case were motivated by facts, not by ideology or by passing a nomination litmus test. Justices Hugo Black, William O. Douglas and Frank Murphy were appointees of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who it’s safe to assume during the early 1940s had other concerns than how his appointees might vote on whether children could be compelled to salute the flag. Donald Trump, by contrast, announced during his presidential campaign that his Supreme Court appointees would overturn Roe v. Wade “automatically.” All three of his nominees, Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett, did just that when the moment arrived.So no, I don’t think the Dobbs justices are sorry. They did what they were put there to do, what they wanted to do, and they were quite explicit in washing their hands of the consequences. The issue of abortion, Justice Kavanaugh wrote in his concurring opinion, “will be resolved by the people and their representatives in the democratic process in the states or Congress.” And if “the people” in whose hands the court placed the issue are sorry about Dobbs? They can follow Justice Kavanaugh’s advice and take their sorrow, or their fury, or their despair to the polls.Linda Greenhouse, the recipient of a 1998 Pulitzer Prize, reported on the Supreme Court for The Times from 1978 to 2008 and was a contributing Opinion writer from 2009 to 2021.The Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.
