NCAA President Charlie Baker admitted to Congress that the NCAA has never even studied the harm done to women when biological males are able to compete in female sports.Earlier this month, a Reduxx exclusive exposed another male dominating female athletes on San Jose State University's Division 1 volleyball team. Blaire Fleming, formerly Brayden, is a 6-foot-1 redshirt junior male athlete wielding insurmountable advantages over the female athletes he competes against.HOUSE REPUBLICANS DEMAND NCAA BAN ON BIOLOGICAL MEN IN WOMEN'S SPORTSFleming is known to be \"unstoppable\" by his female competitors. The net in the men's competition is seven inches higher than in female competition, proving the biological reality  between men and women.Fleming previously played at Coastal Carolina University in South Carolina during the 2020-2021 season his freshman year. As a South Carolina native, I testified on a \"Save Women's Sports\" bill, asking the South Carolina legislature to clarify the requirements for female sports in the state – that the participants… be female. The legislation passed the next season and Fleming transferred to his new school in California.The claim that this \"is not a real issue\" is promoted by adversaries of sex-based protections. TheNCAA's silence plants seedsfor misunderstanding. San Jose State administration reportedly did not know of Fleming's biological sex.WHAT THE NCAA'S BLOCKBUSTER ADMISSION SAYS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF WOMEN'S SPORTSIf the rule makers don't care about the sex of the athlete, why would the school feel a need to investigate? Their job is to win, and these are the rules. That's the landscape the NCAA created.The denial of women’s rights is not just about sports, but future education, safety, dignity and more. Fleming and I both played USAV club volleyball and definitely had to compete against one another before college recruiters. They had to compare the skills I spent my whole life building to something I would never be, a biological male with larger lung capacity, greater height and jumping ability. This could have cost me my college education.The ultimate betrayal for female athletes is that we work our whole lives to attain our peak athletic capacity just for the NCAA to replace us with men.This past year, women's indoor volleyball broke attendance records with 92,000 fans at one game. This month, Caitlin Clark continued to kindle the fire, smashing records and bringing a surge towomen's Final Four viewership. This bright light is fueled by one thing: Americans' interest in women's sports.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONWhen the light grows brighter, the things hidden in the dark start to surface. Americans are clearly on the side of keeping men out of women's sports. But the NCAA refuses to budge.As the NCAA Board of Governors convenes this week, they must take this issue seriously. They are now being sued by 16 former athletes, including myfriends in the cause, Riley Gainesand Kylee Alons, who competed against Lia Thomas and had to stand aside while a man took the podium and dress in a storage closet to keep their dignity as a biological male invaded their locker room.The NCAA's silence speaks volumes to female athletes. In January, when I had the opportunity to discuss the issue with the Chairman of the Board, Baylor University's Dr. Linda Livingstone, at the annual NCAA meeting, I was shut down and told that it was not the \"time or place.\"When is the time? Where is the place? We will be there to tell the NCAA of the betrayal happening inside, the betrayal female athletes have felt for years.The next generation of girls should be excited for the opportunities that lie ahead, but only if this generation does what is right – demand theNCAA follow the leadof the NAIA and keep girls' sports for girls only.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MACY PETTYMacy Petty is an NCAA college volleyball player and a leader of Young Women for America, the collegiate program of Concerned Women for America.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
