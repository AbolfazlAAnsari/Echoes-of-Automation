Yes, the majority might not ever earn more than £40,000 in today’s money, but top artists and writers will and, for those who don’t, their lives may be enriched in other ways.If certain degrees do indeed fail to grant students large salaries, perhaps the government should resolve to make thosecourses less expensivein the first place, rather than artificially capping student numbers.Sebastian MonblatSurbitonWimbledon wonderI fully admit I am no tennis aficionado and the finer points often leave me bereft of technical knowledge. But for once I took my head out of the Sunday newspapers and watched the singles final betweenCarlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic.I was captivated by this seemingly done deal that the reigning champion would win. I was on the edge of my settee and it was really an epic battle. To think that a20-year-old could defeatthe master in this way, confounded us all. It was so evenly pitched and in the end so hard to call, because Alcaraz didn’t give up for a single second or shot.Lovely too, that Djokovic was pleasantly unassuming in his speech afterwards with a gracious nature. I have lined up myWimbledonsettee position for next year.Judith A. DanielsNorfolk"
