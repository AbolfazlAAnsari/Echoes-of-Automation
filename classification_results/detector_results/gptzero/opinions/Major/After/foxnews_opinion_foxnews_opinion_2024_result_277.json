Perhaps Vance, the V.P. pick, will take on a traditional attack-dog role, signaling that Trump’s more restrained stance of the last month is here to stay.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONVance is undoubtedly smart and impressive, as his life’s arc attests. He served his country honorably as a Marine, joining in the post-9/11 era. He will be the only veteran on either ticket and brings special knowledge of that community.He is arguably the best public speaker, when it comes to policy specifics, of any of the four people on either of the major tickets.His inspiring life story has been introduced to many an American via a best-selling book and aRon Howard film. You can’t underestimate the import of a pop-cultural connection to Trump or to everyday voters, who will know him as the \"Hillbilly Elegy\" guy first and then will get to know him as Trump’s running mate. Indeed, a couple of my non-political friends immediately texted me after seeing his name in news alerts to clarify if this was the guy from the Glenn Close movie and book they read a couple of years ago.It would not have been my strategy, but Trump's strategy rarely is.So, I guess maybe the surprise is, by the end of writing this, I’m open to being surprised.
