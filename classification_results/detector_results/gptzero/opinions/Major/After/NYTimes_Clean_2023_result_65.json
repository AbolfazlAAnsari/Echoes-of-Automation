When I was married, my wife and I spent many weekends combing the fabric stores in Manhattan’s garment district. And I once took a night class at Parsons School of Design, where, after working at The Times all day, I would drape muslin over dress forms.I can make no sense of my life without design being central to it, and it never feels to me like a distraction, waste of time or diminution of gravitas. It feels like an expression of freedom.I have become consumed with the idea of freedom, with running toward it, with embracing it. I want freedom in all things: thinking, working, loving and living.That’s one reason I look forward to becoming one of those men with the quirky suspenders, bow ties and orange socks. I’ve often been delighted by how older men lean into sartorial whimsy when they exit workplace life, when the uniform becomes irrelevant, when the testosterone coursing through their systems slows to a trickle.They become emancipated in this delightful way. I assume it’s the same way some women, often older, will wear all their bracelets at once. They return to that magic that we all enjoyed as children, in which dressing up and donning costumes were the expectation rather than an aberration.So I bide my time‌‌, but if the years are kind and life allows, I want one day to be the old man with the orange socks.The Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.
