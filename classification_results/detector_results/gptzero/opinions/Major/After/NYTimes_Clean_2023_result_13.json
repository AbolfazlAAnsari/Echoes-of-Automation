            "inputText": "Readers discuss the pros and cons of clutter. Also: Finding a public bathroom in New York; casual work clothes; a contrast of poverty and wealth.To the Editor:Re “Clutter Is Good for You,” by Rob Walker (Opinion guest essay, Jan. 1):In his essay dissenting from the orthodoxy that clutter is uniformly undesirable, Mr. Walker argues that clutterers’ possessions are meaningful to them. That may be true for a few dozen items on display. But the vast majority of clutter is litter — objects treated with disregard.Much clutter is squirreled away in closets, basements, attics and garages. Most of the hoarded objects are never thought of, and many have been long and totally forgotten. Clutterers keep decades-old newspapers and magazines in waist-high (or higher) stacks. Clutterers likely aren’t saving them for the unread articles; they probably no longer even remember the periodicals’ contents.Clutterers hold onto inoperative and broken devices. They keep these useless items even after they buy their replacements. Who finds meaning in a frying pan with a missing handle or a sock with no mate?Clutterers don’t cling to their articles because the articles are meaningful to them. They cling to them despite their lack of meaning.That is the riddle at the heart of clutter, and Mr. Walker never addresses it.Daniel FleisherBaltimoreTo the Editor:My husband died over a year ago, and I am comforted by Rob Walker’s essay.I have felt mounting pressure to declutter and at the same time a strong desire to keep our rooms looking mostly the way they did on the day he passed. Mr. Walker’s essay helps me validate and understand my desire.As I look around at all I shared with my husband for over 50 years, these objects feel like friends still alive with stories. Why should I want to throw any of them out? They have silently borne witness to our happy times and sad.Through them, I feel his spirit is still here, and they help me go forward each day without him. Why should I want to exchange my inimitable mélange for rooms looking like advertisements for minimalism — kitchens and living rooms so devoid of human life, personality and, as he rightly says, uniqueness?Is decluttering just another pressure to conform?Carolyn Russell StonewellCambridge, Mass.To the Editor:Rob Walker’s essay hit home for me. After my daughter Jennifer’s death, I was encouraged to downsize and purge or donate anything unnecessary. It was difficult, since as Mr. Walker mentions in his essay, many things held no meaning for anyone but me.I realized later that I’d given away a treasure, a book about a girl named Jennifer that illustrated, ironically, the consequences of being disorganized, like me, with too much clutter.Before my Jennifer could read, I would lie down next to her at night, close my eyes if I was tired and recite the entire book to her by heart, while she turned the pages in sync, since she knew that book by heart as well.It began, “Jennifer knew, as well as you, that everything has its place, but she just didn’t care a whit, a bit, so her room was a real disgrace.”Now I can listen to the book on YouTube with my granddaughter, but still long to hold it in my hands, close my eyes and remember my Jennifer.Dorothy E. CorkeryOregon City, Ore.To the Editor:I loved the article, and want to add it to my clutter.Betty M. MossBensalem, Pa.So You Need a Public Toilet in New York City. Good Luck.To the Editor:Re “New York City Doesn’t Have Nearly Enough Free Bathrooms,” by Theodora Siegel (Opinion guest essay, Jan. 17):In Tokyo, which my wife, daughter and I visited four years ago, you are never far from a public toilet. They are not only free, they are also clean, well equipped, properly maintained and often heated.They routinely have hygienic seats that wash your posterior, and it is not unusual that they provide quiet music as well. Their ubiquitous nature means that as a visitor you can explore the city free of anxiety, knowing that this essential need will be met, and met well.New York is also a city that hosts thousands of visitors daily. It seems a glaring omission in the city’s culture of hospitality that it does not dependably provide a place to go, wherever you happen to wander.David BaldwinPetaluma, Calif.To the Editor:Theodora Siegel is indeed correct in describing New York City’s persistent shortage of public restrooms as a public health crisis. For many people, toilet access is no mere convenience; 30 percent of the 1,500 people we polled nationwide in a2022 Crohn’s &amp; Colitis Foundation surveysaid they have had a chronic gastrointestinal or digestive issue.For those dealing with gastrointestinal conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, prompt bathroom access is an urgent medical necessity.We strongly believe that New York City’s businesses should be encouraged to open their restrooms to the public — not just paying customers.New York City has long prided itself on its walkability, but the lack of public bathrooms seriously undermines that claim. New York already has the restroom infrastructure necessary to solve this problem. Our legislators and businesses now must come together to make it happen.Michael OssoNew YorkThe writer is president and C.E.O. of the Crohn’s &amp; Colitis Foundation.Casually Dressed at WorkTo the Editor:Re “The Hour Between Babe and Hag,” by Jessica Grose (Opinion, nytimes.com, Jan. 4):Those deriding the tech bro look as “disheveled” and “slovenly” while wishing for an end to appearance-based discrimination have clearly never paid much attention to the movement’s motto: My work speaks for itself.Past scarcity of qualified technologists has allowed us to negotiate laxer dress codes and show up to business casual interviews in shorts and flip flops, an unofficial uniform of badly sized free hackathon and conference tees that keeps new grads safe from the obligation to buy a new white-collar wardrobe their first week on the job.It’s not just for rich white crypto scams! The trans community is disproportionately represented in software, thanks partly to this lack of appearance policing. Globally distributed teams as the norm keep face-to-face time low enough that even working from offices, team members’ faces are revealed months into collaboration, not as first impressions.So as a woman in computing, I need to defend the tech bros on this one thing. Thankfully I’m not paid to be pretty.Madison WernerColumbus, OhioA Stark Contrast of Poverty and WealthTo the Editor:I was taken by two columns that appeared next to each other in the Jan. 12 print issue: “This Slum Has Something to Teach the World,” by Nicholas Kristof, and “Noma and the Fizzle of Too-Fine Dining,” by Frank Bruni.Mr. Kristof reported on the hope emanating from Kibera, a squalid village in Kenya. There he had to dodge discarded plastic bags of excrement that are used because of the lack of toilets.Meanwhile Mr. Bruni wrote about Noma, a top-ranked Copenhagen restaurant that charges $500 or more per person. He recalled being unsettled by eating a live shrimp there.The adjacent articles captured the bookends of our age.George KlasNew YorkThis article appeared in print on page A19."
