Children cancircumventparental monitoring, sometimes pushing them to pursue their curiosity in dangerous spaces.The problem with restriction and monitoring is that they undermine trust. Researchersdiscoveredthat teenagers want to be trusted, and therefore generally don't respond well to restrictive parenting. In a qualitative analysis of mobile safety app reviews posted by 8- to 19-year-olds, 76% gave the apps a one-star review, describing these apps as invasive of their privacy and negatively impacting their relationships with their parents.But children also don't want full independence online, and theyexpect adults to be involved. Atthe Center for Democracy & Technology, we worked with 14- to 21-year-olds to understand the negative encounters they faced when using online messaging services. Respondents told us that they would turn to a trusted adult when they found themselves in hairy situations but wanted to exercise their discretion of when that would be.Instead of attempting to fully shield kids,scholars have advocatedfor policymakers, companies and parents to focus on equipping young people to navigate the web safely, knowing that caregivers, educators and other support networks are there to help them as they grow.Policymakers, for their part, can advance privacy legislation like the bipartisanAmerican Privacy Rights Act(APRA) introduced earlier this year. APRA aims to minimize data that is collected and processed for all individuals and deter bad actors from targeting harmful content at children and exposing them to unwanted encounters.Policymakers can also strengthen APRA by banning ads targeted to those under 17, a provision backed by lawmakers, child rights groups, digital rights groups andthe Federal Trade Commission. Conversely, enacting a \"parental panopticon,\" assome havecalled models of full control over kids' interactions online, will undermineexpectations of privacy, putting the most marginalized kids at risk.Social media companies are essential in strengthening children's safety online, too. They can provide kids and parents with more tools to control content and interactions on their platforms, likeThreads' new featurethat allows users to filter content based on chosen keywords.But that's not enough - social media platforms should continue takingactive stepstoward more thoughtful designs for young people. In our research, we identified somespecific waysof doing so, such as making private profiles the default, reducing interactions with strangers (such as through notifying users that they have no mutual friends with someone and asking if they would like to proceed), improving user reporting features and providing content warnings when possible, like the onesAppleandInstagramrecently introduced for images with nudity.Instead of forcing restrictions, parents can build on these foundations through\"active mediation,\"which suggests that trusted adults should serve as the connective tissue between unwanted content and negative outcomes. A parent might talk to their child about what they are doing online or respond to something they post on social media. With the support of their parents, young people can learn that risky content exists and develop tools to promote their own safety online.Eroding children's privacy will never do the job of keeping them safe. We cannot divert our attention to policies that feel good when they do little to protect kids. Results matter - especially when there's so much at stake.This story has been updated to reflect news developments.Opinion by Michal Luria and Aliya BhatiaTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
