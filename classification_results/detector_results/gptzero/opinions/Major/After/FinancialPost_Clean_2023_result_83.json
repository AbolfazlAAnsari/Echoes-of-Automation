            "inputText": "Markets are stubborn things. Consumers and providers acting in their own perceived best interests are surprisingly resistant to crusading governments and their moral posturing. What governments can do, however, is make things worse.In this year's federal budget, the Trudeau Liberals declared they were \"cracking down\" on \"predatory lenders ... who take advantage of some of the most vulnerable people in our communities.\" Their crackdown consists of a new national fee limit on the payday loan industry(https://financialpost.com/opinion/ontario-has-a-great-idea-to-help-people-trapped-by-expensive-payday-loans).In 2007, the Harper government allowed provinces to assume oversight for payday loans - short-term loans for up to $1,500 that have to be paid back within two months. They provide cash-strapped workers with immediate access to credit to cover unexpected expenses. Fees are calculated as dollars per $100 borrowed, with current rates ranging from $17 in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia to $14 in Newfoundland. Ottawa now plans to impose a $14 limit across the country.Given their high risk and unsecured nature, the effective rate of interest(https://financialpost.com/tag/interest-rates/) for payday loans is very high. On an annual percentage rate basis, even Newfoundland's $14 rate works out to a staggering 364 per cent. \"Payday loans are a terrible option,\" admits Brian Dijkema, vice-president of external affairs at Cardus, a Canadian social policy think tank. \"But,\" he admits, \"they are often better than the alternative.\"Approximately eight million Canadians are \"non-prime\" borrowers because of their poor credit scores, with an additional 300,000 having no credit score at all. This means a sizeable chunk of Canada's population cannot simply walk into a bank and get a loan or credit card whenever they need it. Going to an alternative lender who charges exorbitant rates can thus make perfect sense. \"If you're about to lose your job because you can't get your car fixed, or your electricity is about to be cut off, then a payday loan can be a very rational choice,\" says Dijkema.The payday loan industry agrees. \"Our members exist because there is a demand for credit that is not fulfilled by banks and other traditional lenders,\" the Canadian Consumer Finance Association (CCFA) said in a statement.Asked about the implications of a new $14 national rate, the CCFA predicts \"borrowers will lose access to licensed, legal lenders.\" The group points to Newfoundland as proving its case. \"No company to our knowledge is solely a payday lender in Newfoundland. They would not be able to survive.\" In 2018 an academic analysis concluded a $15 fee was likely the minimum sustainable rate for the industry. It thus appears Ottawa's plan is to eliminate payday lenders by stealth.But rendering legal payday lenders permanently unprofitable will not improve consumer protection or resolve the underlying problem that many Canadians cannot get a bank loan or credit card. It will simply force them elsewhere in times of financial crisis.Consider Quebec, which never participated in the provincialization of payday loans and therefore does not have a legal payday loan industry. Of course, this doesn't mean Quebeckers don't need - or don't have access to - short-term, high-interest loans. It just means all such transactions occur illegally in the unregulated black market.A web-scraping investigation going back to 2013 by the Canadian Lenders Association (which represents alternative lenders not including the payday loan industry) identified a total of 68 unregulated lending websites targeting Quebeckers with payday-style loans over this time with names such as ouiounon.com, quebec-courtage.com and rapidecashpret.com. Some appear to originate within Canada, while others were hosted in Malaysia, Panama and France. Posted interest rates range as high as 634 per cent - far in excess of what legitimate payday lenders are allowed to charge in other provinces.And it's not just Quebec. Doug Hoyes, a principal at Ontario-based insolvency trustee Hoyes, Michalos &; Associates, says he's dealt with thousands of clients who owe money to illegal, online lenders. Where old school loan sharks once used the threat of broken kneecaps to extract repayment, Hoyes says this new breed of loan badgers prefers verbal violence by phone. \"They will call your home, they will call your mother, they will call your boss,\" often hundreds of times a day, Hoyes says. \"They will keep badgering you until you pay.\"And despite ample evidence that the real predatory lenders are illegal, online operators, Ottawa shows no interest in cracking down on them. Hoyes says he recently submitted proof to federal authorities that a client had been paying an illegal rate of interest. \"I never heard back,\" he reports.No, you won't tame inflation with more government spending(https://financialpost.com/opinion/wont-tame-inflation-more-government-spending)Forget the 'just transition.' It's the Boondoggle Transition(https://financialpost.com/opinion/forget-just-transition-boondoggle-transition)LIV-PGA hearings: Now the government owns golf, too?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/liv-pga-hearings-golf-no-place-for-government)The Liberals' determination to punish legal lenders will not make things better for vulnerable, credit-constrained Canadians. Rather, it will push them into the arms of unregulated, illegal operators who charge higher rates and regularly abuse their clients. Such a perverse outcome is not limited to payday loans. Lax federal enforcement of tobacco smuggling laws alongside public health measures meant to make life impossible for legal cigarette manufacturers has been a boon to the black market in smokes as well. And curiously enough, the legalization of marijuana, while sold to Canadians as a way to eliminate the criminal element in pot sales, has actually made little dent in the illegal market(https://financialpost.com/cannabis/canada-eyes-tighter-rules-for-grow-your-own-pot-producers-to-clamp-down-on-black-market) thanks to exceedingly onerous tax and regulatory policies imposed on legal weed producers and sellers.Always eager to strike a pose and ideologically opposed to the authority of market forces, the Trudeau government is proving to be the black-market lender's best friend.Financial PostPeter Shawn Taylor is senior features editor of C2CJournal.ca, where a longer version of this story first appeared. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
