The map identifies census tracts that are \"overburdened and underserved\" on a variety of measures.These \"Justice40 communities,\" as the administration calls them, are targeted because they, among other things, have higher dependency, have fewer English speakers, struggle with health conditions like diabetes, and are generally \"distressed,\" among other considerations.This is a thinly veiled attempt to direct money to minority communities – a fact that the Biden administration never explicitly says but effectively admits with language about \"equitable distribution,\" \"environmental justice,\" and references to tribes and segregation.In effect, Justice40 relies on a crude form of racial profiling to decide who gets billions of dollars in taxpayer money. Most minority communities vote Democratic, some of them overwhelmingly so.BIDEN'S TRILLION DOLLAR CLIMATE AGENDA IS BLOWING UP AND JOHN KERRY HAS A LOT TO ANSWER FORThe dollars are already flowing. The first Justice40 programs were 21 pilot programs launched in Biden’s first year in office. The list included Housing and Urban Development’s Healthy Homes Grants, Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office, and Homeland Security’s Flood Mitigation Assistance Program, among others. Many of the programs were either tangentially related to climate change or not related at all.The bait-and-switch became even more obvious in 2022 when the Biden administration expanded Justice40 to cover more than 400 federal programs. The list includes everything from rural rental assistance to minority workforce training, elderly housing to passenger ferry grants,the Job Corps to lead exposurein Flint, Michigan, and more.The Biden administration has also said that Justice40 covers a wide variety of programs that provide \"federal financial assistance,\" including grants, loans and benefits to individuals. Huge swaths of the federal government are now funding the communities Biden needs for re-election.BIDEN ADMIN FUNNELS $1 BILLION FOR CLIMATE PROGRAMS AT BORDERS AMID ONGOING MIGRANT CRISISWhile the Biden administration has listed eligible funding streams, it hasn’t said where each dollar is going – a major violation of government transparency. Dozens of federal agencies are now spending billions of dollars outside the public eye, raising obvious questions about political motivations and machinations.But the bigger problem is that Congress didn’t authorize Justice40 or any such focus on\"disadvantaged communities.\"When Congress created the Dairy Margin Coverage program, lawmakers didn’t intend it to subsidize minority farmers or any other specific group beyond farmers generally. When they tasked the Forest Service with building recreation sites, they didn’t have ethnicity or income in mind. When the Rural Housing Service was given authority to hand out single-family-housing direct loans, the goal was to help needy people of all backgrounds, not prioritize some groups over others.In program after program, the Biden administration is taking what Congress made and turning it into what the president wants.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONBut what does Biden want most, but asecond term in the Oval Office? America is witnessing a whole-of-government effort to reward communities that are vital voting blocs for the president. More taxpayer money heads their way every day, with billions of dollars in the queue.And if Biden wins re-election, this campaign will continue well into the future. His administration has already made clear that the list of Justice40 programs will \"evolve over time as new federal programs are created,\" and existing programs will likely receive ongoing funding.You can bet Biden will continue to extend and initiate programs that can funnel more money to potential political supporters.But at what cost? This isn’t about climate change, nor is it about helping disadvantaged communities. It’s about giving an unprecedented political advantage to the president of the United States.Biden isn’t just buying voteswith taxpayer money. He’s buying votes at the expense of constitutional government.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SAM ADOLPHSENEric Bledsoe is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Government Accountability.Sam Adolphsen is the policy director at the Foundation for Government AccountabilityGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
