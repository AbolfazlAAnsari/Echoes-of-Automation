At stake: whether Google is exempt from content liability afterYouTube, its subsidiary, allegedly promoted terrorist videos through its algorithm.The case was brought by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, an American student who was killed in Paris in a 2015 ISIS attack. Google's attorney, Lisa Blatt, said that protecting platforms fromlegal liabilityis what has allowed the Internet to get off the ground.And on Wednesday, the Court heard a collateral case,Twitter v. Taamneh, which examined the potential liability of social media companies for aiding and abetting terrorism by hosting content that expresses support for a group behind an act of violence. Twitter's attorney, Seth Waxman, argued thatTwittercould have been liable if the company were warned that specific accounts were planning an attack, but that in the absence of such warnings, Twitter was not liable.Social mediacompanies must no longer have their cake and eat it too. They must be held to account for failing to quickly deploy the resources and technology to prevent extremist content from inciting violence despite earning a financial bonanza across their platforms.Section 230 has shielded their need to make that investment. Passed at the dawn of the internet age in 1996,Section 230was intended to immunize social media companies from third-party content posted on their platforms. It absolves an \"interactive computer service\" from being treated as a \"publisher or speaker.\"In other words, the platforms are treated as benign providers of digital space and have limited liability exposure to whatever customers decide to upload onto that space.

They have beenusedto incite racially and religiously motivatedattacksacross the US. And the American people are paying the price in terms of lives lost.The crux of the problem is that social media companies earn revenue from digital advertising. Corporate advertisers will pay premiums for placing so-called amplified ads - digital ads that a platform's algorithm posts to a user account that draws the attention of a large number of other users - on content targeted at users who return time and again to their same online interests. And if those interests happen to focus on extremist content, social media companies still increase their profits from repeated user engagement with that content.Advertisers have to rely either on the platforms' assurances they will delete offensive content, or hope that watchdog groups or community members will flag extremist content that they surely would not want their brands to be associated with.
