Nor are “liberal” students who scream at conservative legal scholars interested in the policies of Franklin Roosevelt or the ideas of Michael Harrington and Michael Walzer.The problem is not that either group has been poorly educated. It is that both groups have been all too well educated by social media algorithms.Jesse LarnerNew YorkTo the Editor:Prof. Jon A. Shields’s overly sunny view of conservatism leaves much to be desired. He ignores the fact that throughout the history of the United States — well, the world, actually, but let’s keep it local — most conservatives have been on the wrong side of every single significant social or political issue. In fact, if conservatives had their way, there wouldn’t be a United States: The Tories did not want to separate from England.Conservatives opposed abolishing slavery; they opposed child labor laws, women’s suffrage, Social Security, Medicare, gay marriage and working to stop climate change — among other issues. Throughout history, liberals — usually labeled radicals or socialists or another name meant to alienate them from the majority — have proposed ways to improve society for all, and conservatives have strongly opposed them. Then the majority of the population agreed with the liberals and eventually most conservatives changed their minds and also agreed.Often this agreement has to do with people coming to understand the issues and the ethics involved in making society more equitable. The more one knows about politics and society, the more one will reject conservatism, which is why, as Professor Shields notes, most college professors are not Republicans.Michael SpielmanBronxTo the Editor:What about directing all students away from the crazies and toward solid writings about conservative principles?I am a conservative down in Texas. I read The Times to listen to and understand liberal viewpoints with which I often do not agree (and because y’all are the best war correspondents), but I recognize that liberals and conservatives need each other to check each other’s excesses.We should always try to do better but we should not always presume we know better. America needs good Democrats and Republicans to accomplish this. Neither are evil. Each brings something to the table with enough humility to know that the other does, too.Brian CorriganRichardson, TexasTo the Editor:The unusually thoughtful essay by Jon A. Shields is a welcome antidote to the shrillness of so much discourse in today’s media. Its appeal for college courses that challenge conventional “liberal” thinking is sound and urgent. It is a model of the sort of conservative opinion pieces I would like to see more frequently in The Times.Charles MichenerPalm Beach, Fla.To the Editor:As a lifelong conservative, I am sad to watch the G.O.P. devolve into a populist party and forget the ideals that drove us. I look forward to checking out some of the books Jon Shields recommends.As a high school math teacher, I have a lot on my plate sponsoring our math club and coaching STEM events, but this makes me wonder about sponsoring a high school conservative club and sharing these resources.Azucena OvermanRound Rock, TexasRussia’s Abduction of Ukrainian ChildrenTo the Editor:Re “Russia Signals Intention to Deport More Children” (news article, March 19):Many of the teens and toddlers abducted by Russia from Ukraine have been taken from orphanages, but are not orphans at all. They have parents and extended families.Most end up in these custodial settings because families lack the support to take care of a child born with a disability. Or, mired in poverty, they wish for a better life for them in an orphanage.Sadly, children across the world —an estimated eight million living in institutions— are also in grave danger of being illegally adopted or trafficked for pornography, organs and labor. And those with disabilities in these facilities are often left to die — lonely and painful deaths.These nefarious horrors are only exacerbated during times of conflict.All children need the love and protection of a family. And most families would keep their children if they could.As Russia continues to kidnap children from Ukrainian orphanages, governments, donors and international aid agencies should shift funds to support families.Laurie AhernWashingtonThe writer is president of Disability Rights International.Have Hard Conversations With Your TeensTo the Editor:Re “12 Teens and Tweens on America Today” (“America in Focus” series, Sunday Opinion, March 26):The youth mental health crisis is an urgent, multifaceted issue that requires creative solutions, such as interactive conversations like this one, which give adults a glimpse into the lives of teens today.In February, the C.D.C. released areportshowing, among other concerning statistics, that nearly one in three teen girls in the U.S. seriously considered attempting suicide in 2021, an almost 60 percent increase from 2011. All groups of teens who participated in the study reported increased mental health challenges, and more than one in five nonheterosexual teens attempted suicide in the past year.The 12 kids who participated in this conversation demonstrate how often teen despair can be fueled by factors that can also have a positive impact on kids’ lives, such as phones, remote learning and an understanding of the news cycle. This creates a host of difficult decisions for parents and teens alike.I therefore encourage parents to have similar exploratory conversations with their children. When it comes to school shootings and other distressing subjects, children can often sense fear from adults around them, and avoiding the topic only makes it more frightening.All around us, our children are seeking solutions and asking for help. It’s up to us to not only listen, but also to initiate conversations around these topics.Harold S. KoplewiczNew YorkThe writer, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, is the founding president and medical director of the Child Mind Institute.Scams Against ArtistsTo the Editor:Re “Fake Buyers Are Phishing in Art World” (Arts, March 20):Preying on the vulnerabilities of artists is a heartless occupation. As a working artist, I have had an untold share of phishing emails and more recently phishing DMs through my Instagram account. Your article was an excellent forensic examination of a typical scam.This type of phishing can take a psychic toll, and it also requires artists to spend valuable time  (when they could be creating) trying to determine whether or not an inquiry is legitimate or fake. It’s exhausting!I often think that if the time and energy scammers devote to their trade were applied to something legitimate, they might be successful entrepreneurs.Carrie MeganWellesley, Mass.This article appeared in print on page A19."
