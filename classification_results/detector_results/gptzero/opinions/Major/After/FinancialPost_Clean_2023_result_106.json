Only one problem: saving money means something completely different in Ottawa than it does in the rest of Canada.\"The budget ... includes that $15 billion of savings so we could fund the programs outlined in the budget,\" Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland recently said(https://www.blacklocks.ca/says-savings-will-be-spent/ ). \"It is not new savings.\" In other words, the \"savings\" are going to be spent - and then some. But only people living in the shadow of the Peace Tower think cutting back on Big Macs so you can spend more on Beef Wellington constitutes \"saving money.\"Budget 2023(https://www.budget.canada.ca/2023/pdf/budget-2023-en.pdf) shows federal spending was $470 billion in 2022. By 2027, Ottawa plans to spend almost $556 billion. When you increase spending by $85 billion, that's not \"saving money.\"This has been a problem for a while. The Trudeau government was spending at all-time highs(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/blogs/prime-ministers-and-government-spending-2021-edition) before the pandemic, even after controlling for inflation and population growth. The 2019 budget(https://www.budget.canada.ca/2019/docs/plan/budget-2019-en.pdf) then projected spending this year of $402 billion. But that was then. Now the government plans to spend $491 billion this year, almost a quarter more than it solemnly said it would just four years ago.After years of a debt-fueled spending binge, real cuts are needed. Here's a blueprint for any politician serious about cutting spending:The place to start is at the top. That means ending automatic pay raises for members of parliament, as the Harper government did following the 2008-09 recession(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-liberals-mum-as-tories-ndp-say-they-would-support-mp-pay-freeze/). Unlike most Canadians, MPs have had four raises(https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/Salaries) since the beginning of 2020, ranging from an extra $15,700 for a backbencher to an extra $31,400 for the prime minister. As for the governor general, after a $48,800(https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/gov-gen-pockets-9500-pay-raise) pay bump during the pandemic, she can probably get along on her $351,600 salary for a while.Since Justin Trudeau became prime minister the cost of running the Senate has soared roughly 70 per cent(https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/senate-costs-up-70-per-cent-in-seven-years-1.6688926). Senators can also make do for a year or two or even cut back.The feds also need to eliminate extravagant travel expenses. That means no more $6,000 per night(https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/lilley-canadas-delegation-to-queens-funeral-spent-almost-400000-for-hotel-rooms-alone) luxury hotel suites for the PM, no more $71,000(https://nationalpost.com/news/71k-in-limo-service-for-governor-generals-2022-four-day-iceland-trip) \"ice-limos\" for the GG or $18 million(https://www.blacklocks.ca/18m-for-frankfurt-high-life/ ) trips to attend a four-day German book fair.These savings won't balance the budget on their own. But they would give our leaders the moral authority they need to cut spending within the bureaucracy. It consumes half the government's day-to-day spending. According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, spending on it increased by 31 per cent(https://distribution-a617274656661637473.pbo-dpb.ca/b6aaf0274b613d1d86debb6e038f8794194733225f5dc2b4bc99f712c6c6f343) over the past two years. The government has hired an extra 98,000(https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/trudeau-government-increased-federal-employees-since-2015) employees since it took power in 2015, an increase of roughly 40 per cent.The feds have dished out $1.3 billion(https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/federal-executives-took-in-1-3-b-in-bonuses-2015-2022) in bonuses since 2015, despite the PBO finding(https://distribution-a617274656661637473.pbo-dpb.ca/bebf87487d1ff5ca83cf40817fc2a4d8f18632d0c9ba4e3e68e951fc41990f29) that \"less than 50 per cent of (performance) targets are consistently met.\" Add 800,000(https://www.taxpayer.com/newsroom/feds-hand-out-more-than-800,000-raises-in-past-three-years#:~:text=The%20federal%20government%20handed%20out,access%2Dto%2Dinformation%20request. ) pay raises over the last three years and it's easy to see how costs balloon.The Bank of Canada rubber-stamped $20 million(https://www.taxpayer.com/newsroom/-20-million-in-bonuses-at-bank-of-canada-despite-40-year-high-inflation) in bonuses last year despite failing to keep inflation anywhere near its two per cent target. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has handed out $75 million(https://www.taxpayer.com/newsroom/cmhc-hands-out-75-million-in-bonuses-during-housing-affordability-crisis) in bonuses since the beginning of 2020, even though many Canadians are struggling to afford homes. A simple way to save money would be to take a tip from Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g863vuV4hQ&;t=372s) and \"cancel bonuses for failing government authorities.\"The feds should also cancel corporate welfare, like the more than $20 billion(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-stellantis-lg-battery-plant-deal-ontario/) for multinational automakers Volkswagen and Stellantis. There are also lesser-known subsidies: $420 million(https://northernontario.ctvnews.ca/feds-provide-up-to-420m-to-make-algoma-steel-greenest-steel-producer-1.5497090) for Algoma Steel, $700 million(https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/transat-refunds-1.6006792#:~:text=Business-,Transat%20deal%20for%20%24700M%20government%20bailout%20includes%20cash%20for,off%20because%20of%20COVID%2D19. ) for Transat, $295 million(https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ford-oakville-government-1.5754974) for Ford Motor Company, $110 million(https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/toyota-canada-plants-to-get-1-4b-upgrade-ottawa-ontario-to-pitch-in-1.3916069) for Toyota, $41 million(https://torontosun.com/2017/01/09/feds-province-give-grants-of-42m-each-to-honda-for-ontario-plant) for Honda, $372 million(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bombardier-announcement-feds-1.3971263#:%7E:text=The%20federal%20government%20says%20it,7000%20and%20CSeries%20aircraft%20projects. ) for Bombardier and $12 million(https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2019/04/government-of-canada-supports-climate-action-by-loblaw.html) for Loblaws.Opinion: Don't believe teachers' unions about Ontario schools(https://financialpost.com/opinion/dont-believe-teachers-unions-ontario-schools-underfunded)Opinion: Tax incentives could help solve the rental housing crisis(https://financialpost.com/opinion/federal-tax-incentives-solve-rental-housing-crisis)Opinion: Liberals should take accountability lessons from Bank of Canada(https://financialpost.com/opinion/trudeau-liberals-accountability-bank-of-canada)Bigger savings can be found by asking bigger questions:Is equalization a forever program? Will taxpayers in the higher-income provinces be subsidizing other provinces' politicians for the rest of Canada's existence?Why do the feds need to own a train company (VIA Rail) that loses hundreds of millions of dollars(https://media.viarail.ca/sites/default/files/publications/VIA%20Rail_2022%20Annual%20Report_0.pdf) every year?Why do Canadians pay more than $1.2 billion annually for a state broadcaster (the CBC) that's rapidly losing relevance but still competes directly with other media?Why does the loser of an election (the Leader of the Opposition) get a taxpayer-funded mansion for an official residence?The government says it's looking for $15 billion in savings over the next five years. Its track record suggests it won't find them. But given the bloat in Ottawa, cutting $15 billion should only be the start.Franco Terrazzano is federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
