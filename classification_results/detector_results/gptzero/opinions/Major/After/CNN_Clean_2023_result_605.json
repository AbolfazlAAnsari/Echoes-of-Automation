Learning beside my older brother, I've acquired some basic coding skills over the last few years. And coding is something that I would love to explore more in college. I think I could translate some of my coding knowledge into developing AI tools that would help artists expand the breadth and reach of their craft, without displacing them from the creation of it.Yet, as I stare at my computer screen wondering in what direction to take my college essay, I am struck by the fact that not including my racial identity - and the financial challenges that accompanied it - could be a disadvantage.As my mother worked hard to care for my two siblings and me, she did not have the means to pay for advanced academic classes or expensive tutors. Consequently, my college transcript is not full of honors classes, perfect standardized test scores or half a dozen AP courses.The reality is neither she nor I ever had the luxury of time. I work every summer to earn enough money to help contribute to my family's household, to pay for gas and to cover some basic amenities. I want colleges to understand that - and in the absence of a box that might begin to hint at the reason why, I know the Indo-Fijian essay is the one I will ultimately submit.But there's an added layer of frustration, even if I choose to write about my racial identity, there is no guarantee the college I attend will reflect the diversity of my generation. When Californiavoted to eliminate affirmative actionat state colleges and universities in the 1990s, there was an immediate drop in Black and brown enrollment, and even today it has not fully returned to its pre-elimination of affirmative action levels.If we continue to force minorities to choose between sharing their passion or sharing their struggle, the campuses of our most elite academic institutions will likely become more and more White and less and less reflective of the richness of identities that has come to define our country.Opinion by Sivaan SharmaTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
