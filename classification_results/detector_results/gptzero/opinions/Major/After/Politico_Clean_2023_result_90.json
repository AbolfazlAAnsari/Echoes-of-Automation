            "inputText": "Any further delay will only invite more Russian aggression.The following open letter was signed by 46 foreign policy experts whose names and affiliations are listed below.The upcoming NATO summit in Vilnius that begins July 11 will take place at a time of danger and opportunity. Russian President Vladimir Putin's revisionist ambition to remake the security order in Europe has foundered in Ukraine and exposed cracks in the foundation of his regime. But Putin has yet to abandon his goal of establishing control of Ukraine or his belief that he can outlast Kyiv and the West. Leaving Ukraine in a gray zone of ambiguity invites Russian aggression.The alliance will convene in Vilnius as Kyiv's counteroffensive enters its second month. It now seems that most NATO allies, not just the Central and East European states that have long understood the dangers of the Kremlin's revisionist policies, lean toward a more ambitious agenda for Vilnius. We present these ideas to help the administration and NATO allies move toward a successful summit, one that brings us closer to restoring a stable and secure Europe.This means taking steps to ensure that Ukraine 1) wins this war and reestablishes full control over its internationally recognized 1991 borders; and 2) is fully anchored in the security and economic arrangements that from 1945 until 2014 made Europe a continent of peace, prosperity and cooperation. The transatlantic community can only be stable and secure if Ukraine is secure. Ukraine's entry into NATO, fulfilling the promise made at the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, would achieve that.In Vilnius, NATO heads of state and government should offer an unequivocal statement of alliance support for Ukraine and for Kyiv's aim of regaining sovereignty and territorial integrity within its 1991 borders. They should further underscore their readiness to supply Ukraine weapons - including longer-range missiles such as ATACMS, Western fighter planes and tanks - in sufficient quantities to prevail on the battlefield. This will demonstrate the allies' unequivocal commitment to Ukrainian victory and send a clear message to Moscow that its military situation in Ukraine will only grow worse the longer the conflict continues.In Vilnius, the alliance should launch a roadmap that will lead clearly to Ukraine's membership in NATO at the earliest achievable date. As with Finland and Sweden, the process can bypass the Membership Action Plan in light of the close and ongoing interactions between NATO and Ukraine. NATO heads of state and government should task the Council in permanent session to develop recommendations on the timing and modalities of an accession process for Ukraine for decision at the next NATO summit in Washington in 2024.To enhance Ukraine's security until it joins NATO, NATO and Ukraine at Vilnius should establish a deterrence and defense partnership under which:· the allies will provide all necessary arms, training, equipment, and intelligence and other support to deter or defeat ongoing and new aggression by Russia; and· Ukraine will continue to carry out essential steps to expedite its integration into the alliance and its command structures.At the Vilnius summit, the allies and Ukraine should upgrade the NATO-Ukraine Commission to a NATO-Ukraine Council. The Council will oversee the deterrence and defense partnership and serve as a crisis consultation mechanism - in the spirit of Article 4 of the Washington Treaty - in the event of a threat to the territorial integrity, sovereignty, or security of Ukraine or any of the NATO member states.In Vilnius, the allies should reaffirm their commitment to enhance coordinated measures to meet Ukraine's urgent needs for military and defense equipment, focusing directly on air defense systems, long-range missiles and necessary ammunition, tanks and advanced combat aircraft.To expand practical assistance to Ukraine, the allies should invite Ukraine to assign additional liaison officers at NATO headquarters and commands to support the launch of a joint process of developing a Ukrainian long-term national security strategy, national defense strategy, and national defense posture compatible with NATO standards and planning.The allies should also approve the updated Comprehensive Assistance Package to facilitate Ukraine attaining full interoperability with NATO forces and making a comprehensive transition to NATO standards. The focus should be on the transition to Western weapons systems; creation of a modern, NATO-compatible air and missile defense system; creation of a medical rehabilitation system for wounded soldiers, as well as a system for soldier reintegration into civilian life and a comprehensive demining effort.Vilnius can be a historic NATO summit. The above steps would bring closer NATO membership for Ukraine and, with it, the elimination of gray zones and ambiguous security situations that have proven to be an invitation to aggression. The result would be a more stable, secure, and prosperous transatlantic community.Signed:Stephen E.
