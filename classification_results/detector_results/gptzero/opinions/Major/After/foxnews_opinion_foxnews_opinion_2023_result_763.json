Yet again our world feels wounded, worried, and weary.  It feels surreal, doesn’t it? How are we to respond? How are we to cope? How should we process all this chaos?Jesus told us this would happen.  \"And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.\" (Mt. 24:6-7)I'M IN THE FIELD FOR FOX IN JERUSALEM. I'VE SEEN HAMAS HORRORS AND IT HIT ME VERY HARDOf the past 3,400 years of recorded history, humans have been war-free for only 268 years, or 8% of them.Cain was violent first. We are violent still.  Yet in the last few decades, the world has seen violence escalate to new levels. The phrase \"nation against nation, kingdom against kingdom\" is a Hebrew  idiom for a world war. A global conflict is a signal of the coming end of this age.Have we seen this? Yes. Twice in the last century the conflict was so universal it earned the phraseWorld War. More people died from war in the 20th Century than in all other centuries combined.We live in ever-present fear of worldwide destruction. Let one person press one button and nuclear disaster could happen. Russia has invaded Ukraine.China is threatening Taiwan. Israel feels pinched by Hamas to the south and Hezbollah to the North.We live in ever-present fear of worldwide destruction. Let one person press one button and nuclear disaster could happen. Russia has invaded Ukraine. China is threatening Taiwan. Israel feels pinched by Hamas to the south and Hezbollah to the North.I do not have a national security clearance, but I can Google. So, I googled the question ‘How Many Nations Have Nuclear Weapons?\" The answer: nine!  According to one report, \"The warheads on just one U.S. nuclear-armed submarine have seven times the destructive power of all the bombs dropped during World War II, including the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan.\"I’m just full of good news, aren’t I?OUR AMERICAN-ISRAELI 21-YEAR-OLD SON WAS MURDERED IN THE HAMAS ATTACKS. THIS IS WHAT WE WANT THE WORLD TO KNOWI actually have good news, great news.Here it is:Jesus, the onewho warned of these days will deliver us from these days. The birth pains will continue. The frequency of deception and division will increase, but Jesus will protect us until he comes, and He will deliver us once he comes. For that reason, Jesus spoke this next phrase, \"See to it that you are not troubled\" (Mt.24:6).How can we do this?First make sure that you are saved. Jesus Christ died on the cross for sinners like you and me. \"He does not want anyone to be lost, but he wants all people to change their hearts and lives.\" (2 Pet. 3:9).Have you surrendered your heart to him? If not, do so. He loves you. You were not made to experience the coming chaos. We are nearing the end. You do not want to face thefinal hours with no Savior. Tell him that you are a sinner, and He is a Savior. \"…everyone who calls upon the Lord shall be saved…\" (Rom. 10:13).CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONNext, \"Pray for peace in Jerusalem\" (Ps. 122:6.)
