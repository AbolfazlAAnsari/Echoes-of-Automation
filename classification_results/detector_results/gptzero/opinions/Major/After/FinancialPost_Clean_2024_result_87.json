It was that inadvertent chill ... that led me not to say anything publicly.\"O'Toole now regrets his silence, particularly because, as he puts it, the \"approach the government(https://foreigninterferencecommission.ca/fileadmin/user_upload/PIFI_-_Public_Hearings_-_Volume_9_-April_3__2024-English_interpretation.pdf) was taking complemented ... narratives that were being advanced by ... China and its agents in Canada. And I think in the election, we saw that explode into a campaign of misinformation on social media, but also in in-person miscommunication to intimidate voters, to mislead voters with respect to me, with respect to certain candidates and to our policies in general.\"Rather than go public, O'Toole testified(https://foreigninterferencecommission.ca/fileadmin/user_upload/PIFI_-_Public_Hearings_-_Volume_9_-April_3__2024-English_interpretation.pdf), \"We worked with the mechanisms, we worked with SITE\" (the Security and Intelligence Threats to Election task force), i.e. the web of committees, agencies and task forces - some 15 in total - the Trudeau government set up to monitor election interference and other election-related illegalities. Those committees kept reassuring the Conservatives nothing was amiss. Yet the Conservatives knew these bodies, which all reported directly or indirectly to Trudeau, were powerless to take any action without his agreement. Unsurprisingly, complaining to Trudeau came to naught.A CSIS whistleblower finally did expose SITE's failures. That led to Justice Hogue's commission and its eventual confirmation of what the Conservatives had known but never revealed: that the CCP's election interference may have led to seats being stolen in the 2021 election.In the next federal election, expected in 2025, both Trudeau and the CCP may well employ the same Trump-and-racism playbook. The Liberals are already likening Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre to Trump(https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-testing-videos-targeting-conservative-leader-1.7018171) and changing(https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/bill/C-65/first-reading) Canadian election laws to include, among other things, greater use of mail-in ballots. Because of their susceptibility to fraud most countries ban such ballots(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3666259). But Trump and the Republicans blame them for election skulduggery, so if the Conservatives object to them - as all Canadians concerned about election integrity should - the Liberals will paint them with a Trumpian brush.Build back common sense(https://financialpost.com/opinion/build-back-economic-common-sense)Let pension funds decide for themselves where to invest(https://financialpost.com/opinion/let-canadian-pension-funds-decide-where-to-invest)The challenge for Poilievre will be to show more spine than O'Toole in standing up for his candidates and country and this time blowing the whistle on CCP fraud.Financial PostPatricia Adams, an economist, is executive director of Probe International, a China watchdog.Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the business news you need to know - add financialpost.com(https://financialpost.com/ ) to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here(https://financialpost.com/newsletters/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=¬© 2024 Postmedia Network Inc.
