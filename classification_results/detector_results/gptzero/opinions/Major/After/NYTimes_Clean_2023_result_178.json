Allow the proceedings to continue without live in-court coverage. Reporters, sketch artists and the public can be there. Then when the verdict is reached, the trial tapes could be released.This way we would have as fair a trial as possible, while also being able to see everything in detail later.James BettlesSacramentoTo the Editor:As a retired appellate attorney in federal criminal court, I found Steven Brill’s essay about televising Donald Trump’s trial compelling. However, knowing well the federal court system’s rigid rules against televising proceedings, I suggest an admittedly inferior alternative: Court TV (or any channel) could stage a duplicate trial using court professionals that literally tracks the daily trial transcript and follows only slightly behind the actual court schedule.Gwen SpiveyTallahassee, Fla.To the Editor:Re “Televising the Trump Trial Is a Bad Idea,” by Nick Akerman (Opinion guest essay, Aug. 11):The points raised by Mr. Akerman against broadcasting the trials Donald Trump is facing with respect to juror and witness safety seem valid as presented. But these are no ordinary trials, and Mr. Trump is no ordinary defendant.Courts routinely balance potential adverse impacts with the public’s right to know, and in these cases, visibility and transparency tip the balance to broadcast.But there is a middle ground that will achieve all aims: livestream audio. It works for the Supreme Court, and it will work for these trials.Mark AbrahamsOyster Bay, N.Y.The Republican Loyalty PledgeTo the Editor:Re “Ex-President Says He Won’t Sign Pledge Needed for Debate” (news article, Aug. 11):Will anyone believe a pledge by Republican candidates to support the eventual party nominee, as a requirement to participate in the first Republican presidential debate?It’s hard to imagine that Mike Pence, Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson would not “rethink” their pledge should Donald Trump be the nominee.As for the ex-president, it’s no surprise that he won’t sign the pledge (for once he is being honest) since he was probably not planning to engage in the debate in the first place.Since the Republican National Committee sets the rules, and Mr. Trump leads in the national polls and more than qualifies for the stage, perhaps it should place a lectern on the stage with a picture of Mr. Trump. The elephant in the room should have a fake presence at the least. It will highlight the absurdity of it all.Eddy A. BresnitzBala Cynwyd, Pa.The Cruelty Behind Cheap PorkTo the Editor:Re “The Truth About Your Bacon,” by Nicholas Kristof (column, Aug. 6):I want to thank you for bringing attention to the grave ethical concerns surrounding pig farming and slaughter practices. The treatment of these sentient beings in the meat industry is a matter that demands immediate reflection and change.The standard practices in factory farms, where pigs endure a life of confinement, neglect and cruelty, contradict the principles of compassion and nonviolence most people aspire to. The indiscriminate killing of these intelligent creatures is not only morally troubling but also contributes to environmental degradation.As a society, we must re-evaluate our relationship with animals and move toward plant-based alternatives to end this cycle of suffering.James CorcoranGlorieta, N.M.To the Editor:It’s interesting how just about every time an animal rights organization is able to sneak a camera into a factory farm, the footage obtained is enough to make you lose your lunch. Thanks, Nicholas Kristof, for giving readers a glimpse of where their food comes from.Vegans are often characterized as extremists, but what I find extreme is brutally torturing animals in order to provide cheap food and huge profits. It prompts the question: If you wouldn’t abuse an animal, why are you comfortable paying others to do it for you?Stewart DavidVenice, Fla.Driverless Cabs in San FranciscoTo the Editor:Re “Spread of Driverless Cabs Is Approved in San Francisco” (Business, Aug. 11):One of the best things about living in San Francisco for the past five decades has been the ability to bicycle everywhere: to stores, restaurants, films, even to the hospital on occasion.I’ve been happily pedaling the streets of San Francisco at age 80-plus, but now that the California Public Utilities Commission has given the green light to the expansion of service by the ghostly driverless cars, I will venture forth by bike no more.I’ve already encountered too many Waymos making wrong turns and ignoring pedestrians in crosswalks.Caroline Cooley CrawfordSan FranciscoHomesick at CampTo the Editor:Re “Sleepaway Camp Staples: Sun, Fun, Games and Now Therapy” (front page, Aug. 6):When my youngest daughter was a preteen, I sent her to a weight-loss sleepaway camp. In the snail-mail era, we received letters dripping with homesickness and sadness. She begged to be brought home. “What’s more important, how your child feels or how much money you spent?” she asked us.We and she stuck it out. But she has never sent her own daughter to a sleepaway camp!Norma A. OrovitzBay Harbor Islands, Fla.This article appeared in print on page A19."
