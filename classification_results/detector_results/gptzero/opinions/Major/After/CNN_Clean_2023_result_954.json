For the first time since the Mubarak days, the Egyptian governmenthasorganized anti-Israel proteststo try to come out ahead of public opinion on supporting the Palestinians and better control the demonstrations.The very staunch US support for Israel, which reflects longstanding American policy, sharpened further by the brutal nature of Hamas terror and Biden's own convictions about it, has inevitably created additional tensions in the Arab world. The view that the US is complicit in the human suffering in Gaza is widely held in the Arab world, partly out of compassion and partly out of political opportunism. This, naturally, complicates Egypt's engagement with the US and helps explain why the meeting with Biden last week was canceled, after (later disproven) reports of Israeli targeting a hospital in Gaza circulated.However, the delicate way the US approached the cancellation, framing it as a response to theperiod of mourning announcedby the three Arab countries and expressing sympathy for the victims, helped ease pressure on Sisi, who would have been criticized by his public for appearing with the US president at such highly charged times, and was no doubt appreciated in Cairo. Subsequent US policy, focusing ondelivery of aid into Gazaalso signaled support for Egypt's position, buying some goodwill from Cairo.Still, if Washington is committed to the objectives of both supporting Israel in its campaign to degrade, if not eradicate, Hamas and at the same time providing critical humanitarian support to Palestinian civilians, the US will need to coordinate with its Arab allies. For reasons of geography, history and diplomatic heft, Egypt is the linchpin.Opinion by Ghaith al-Omari and David SchenkerTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
