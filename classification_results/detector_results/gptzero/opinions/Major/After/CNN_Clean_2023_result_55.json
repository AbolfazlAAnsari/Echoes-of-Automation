It will take federal legislation, Pruitt concluded.\"Proof of success will come when we never again hear the plaintive cries of a Black man calling for his mother while being brutalized.\"Van Joneswrote,\"Learning that your child's life was senselessly stolen from him is every Black parent's nightmare. But - surprisingly to many people - the five officers charged with viciously beating him were also Black.\"\"How do we explain Nichols' horrific killing, allegedly at the hands of police who looked like him?\"\"One of the sad facts about anti-Black racism is that Black people ourselves are not immune to its pernicious effects,\" Jones noted. \"Society's message that Black people are inferior, unworthy and dangerous is pervasive. Over many decades, numerous experiments have shown that these ideas can infiltrate Black minds as well as White. Self-hatred is a real thing...\"California's painOnly four weeks into the new year, America has alreadyexperienced44 mass shootings.Eleven people were killed in a shooting at a Monterey Park, California, dance studio, as the city's majority-Asian population was celebrating Lunar New Year. It hit close to home forJeff Yang. \"Dozens of people in my immediate friend network shared that they were 'marked safe,' detailed how they had been near the dance studio hours or even minutes before the attack or noted that they were connected to people among the wounded or dead,\" Yang noted. \"These incidents feel like they're looming ever nearer, like a specter from a 3D horror movie drifting inexorably toward the camera.\" The 72-year-old Asian man suspected of the killings died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\"It's understandable that Asian Americans might have,once upon a time, thought that our ethnic communities were insulated from the realities of this country's spiraling epidemic of gun violence.After all, parts of Asia have among the lowest gun homicide rates in the world,\" Yang wrote, citing very low numbers in Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore.\"What's interesting is that gun use is very much a part of all three of those cultures since they each require compulsory military service for every able male.\" While people were mourning the Monterey Park victims, a gunman in Northern California opened fire at two locations in San Mateo County on Monday, killing seven. A 66-year-old farmworker was charged in what the police called a \"workplace violence incident.\"Weapons for UkraineWhen Winston Churchill served as the minister overseeing the British Royal Navy as First Lord of the Admiralty, he formeda committee in 1915that would have a major effect on the future of war: its purpose was to explore the potential of\"landships\"- armored weapons of war that we know today as tanks.More than a century later, tanks are still viewed as central, and they could possibly be decisive in the outcome of the war between Russia and Ukraine. AsDavid A. Andelmanobserved, \"Going into the war in Ukraine a year ago, conventional wisdom suggested that tanks had seen the best of their days - outflanked and vulnerable to drones or fire-and-forget missiles.\"\"Conventional wisdom is clearly wrong. It's becoming quite apparent that armored dominance on a battlefield like Ukraine could turn the tide, dramatically.\" The US, Germany and other European nations announced last week that they are sending tanks to help Ukraine's war effort as it gears up for a possible Russian offensive in the spring. \"The West needs to get the latest generation of tanks in place quickly,\" Andelman wrote.\"The clock is ticking loudly.\"There are 21st century weapons in use too. \"The fighting in Ukraine represents the first long-term, sustained conflict where all the currently available uses for drones are an indispensable part of combined operations - and on both sides,\" wroteKeir Giles.\"With the speed at which drone technology is advancing, Western militaries should have decisions in place now for how they are to deal with both the operational and moral challenges of their own or their enemies' dronesbeing able to kill without human supervision.\"Doomsday clockThe risks of worldwide disaster are growing, in part due to the Ukraine war. So on Tuesday \"the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists' Science and Security Board moved the hands of the Doomsday Clock closer to midnight than they've ever been. It marks the first change in three years to the Clock's time; it now stands at 90 seconds to midnight,\" wrote former California Gov.Jerry Brown, Sharon SquassoniandDaniel Holz.\"Never in the Doomsday Clock's 76-year history have we been so close to global catastrophe.\"Earth's coreHere's one global change we probably don't need to worry about: The rotation of the Earth's core is slowing.\"This is scientifically interesting,\" observed physicistDon Lincoln, \"butrather less dramatic than some of the headlines have suggested.\"\"Researchers have seen this periodic change in the speed of the rotation of the Earth's core before and they still debate the rate at which it occurs, with some suggesting a 70-year cycle, while others suggest a much faster one.\"What's fascinating is the complexity of the planet's innards: \"The Earth is not a solid ball,\" Lincoln noted. \"There is the innermost core, which is a solid sphere about the same size as the planet Mars. Surrounding that is the outer core, which is liquid rock. The next layer is the mantle, which is sort of taffy-like in consistency. Finally there is the crust, which is the outermost layer - the place where we live.\"Near-death experienceThe restaurant where Dr.Kevin G. Volppwas dining with friends didn't have a defibrillator, but when he suddenly collapsed, they started CPR right away. And Cincinnati first responders soon arrived with the equipment and medications to \"to jump-start my heart. I was fortunate to be near a major university hospital with highly skilled personnel (the same hospital that initially treated Damar Hamlin),\" Volpp wrote.Only 10% of the roughly 1,000 Americans who experience cardiac arrest outside hospitals each day survive, he noted. \"Signing up for a CPR course, advocating for greater defibrillator access, training people in telecommunicator CPR use and participating in the CARES registrywill improve survival chances for people in your community who experience cardiac arrest.\"Pence's lifeline for BidenAmid the controversy over misplaced classified documents - which started with the discovery of former President Donald Trump's large cache of papers at Mar-a-Lago - former presidents and vice presidents are checking their files. One of them, Mike Pence, has already inadvertently thrown a lifeline to President Joe Biden, whose handling of secret documents, like Trump's, is under investigation by a special counsel.AsJulian Zelizerwrote, \"Biden, who has struggled for weeks to contain the fallout surrounding the discovery of classified documents at his home and former office,must have sighed with reliefwhen former Vice President Mike Pence announced classified documents were also found at his home in Indiana.\"Still, Zelizer added, \"Biden, who established himself as the responsible foil to Trump in 2020, has now squandered the political high ground on this issue. And with Pence thrown into the mix, Trump's team believes the latest developments could help support their argument that this should be treated as an administrative issue, rather than a criminal one. Biden also has more to lose when it comes to the issue of reputation...\"For more on politics:Patrick T.

But bakers don't need to despair, according to food journalistSusan Puckett.\"Lately, savvy vegan bakers have mainstreamed the idea of whipping aquafaba, the liquid drained off a can of chickpeas or white beans, as they would egg whites, and folding them into batters to lighten them,\" Puckett noted.\"Also in baking, bananas, dates, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, and avocado can sometimes be substituted for eggs.Silken tofu, yogurt, and chia or flax seeds, which turn to gel when soaked in liquid, can also do the trick.\"And don't forget another kind of ersatz egg: Puckett tried her great-grandmother's recipe for a cake using applesauce: \"It turned out beautifully: denser than egg-leavened cakes, but moist and highly scarfable, even more so with the thick layer of caramel icing encasing it.\" The recipe says the cake will last four days -- but in a lot of households, it's going to vanish much sooner.Opinion by Richard Galant, CNNTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
