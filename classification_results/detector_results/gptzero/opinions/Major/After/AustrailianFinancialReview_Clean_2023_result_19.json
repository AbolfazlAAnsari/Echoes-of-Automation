            "inputText": "Case study The Liberal Party should study British PM Rishi Sunak rather than tacking like a yacht to accommodate fads and fashions.I've had two conversations over the past three weeks that have particularly struck me. The one was with a former Liberal cabinet minister who told me that Australia like the rest of the Western world has shifted substantially to the left in recent times and the Liberal Party had to shift to the left as well to embrace the zeitgeist of the era. If the Liberal Party didn't swing to the left, then it was doomed as a political movement because young people were embracing leftist dogma and would not change as they aged.The other conversation was with one of my friends who is a passionate campaigner for the Yes case in the Voice referendum. He told me that the Yes camp had assumed that Australia had shifted to the progressive left over the last few years and that the public would embrace a progressive proposal like the Voice. As the Yes campaign was stalling, what did I think they should do now to defeat the No campaign.These two people, who incidentally know each other very well, are being driven in their opinions by the latest political and policy fads that have always been favoured by the herd in the Canberra press gallery.In both cases, I told them to study the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak. Read the media and they'll tell you his Conservative Party is in for a hiding at the next British election - due in around 15 months.Maybe they're right. After all, the Tories have been in power for 13 years and have presided over Brexit, the pandemic and the inflationary surge triggered by pandemic over-reach. And they've been led by four prime ministers, with all the drama that has involved. But I'm not so sure they'll do as badly as many commentators hope. The reason is Sunak.Sunak is an interesting person. He's highly intelligent - I'd say he's one of the two or three smartest leaders I've ever met - and he's a workaholic. He's not an ideological leader driven by starry-eyed visions of an ideal society like Robespierre, Lenin, Stalin or Mao. But he's not unprincipled. His lodestar can be summed up in one word: reality. After all, there is an old saying: the greatest ally of conservatives is reality.Sunak measures issues carefully and looks at what can realistically be done to address a problem. And instead of spinning through a gullible media a load of idealistic nonsense, he gives people the facts.Over the last few weeks, the British prime minister has done what few leaders have had the courage to do. He's launched a policy attack on vacuous climate change sloganeering by telling the public the truth.He knows that to achieve net zero by 2050 will require huge costs and sacrifices, if it's to be achieved at all. And it's low-income people who will bear the greatest pain from crippling increases in energy bills, forcing motorists to buy expensive electric vehicles, charging people to drive their cars in built-up areas, forcing people to buy expensive boilers, insulate their homes and so on. Sunak has told the public the truth and announced policy changes to make the cost of climate action more affordable and less painful. Target years banning new petrol and diesel car sales have been extended, lower income people have been exempted from installing heat pumps rather than gas boilers, plans to tax meat sales have been canned and so on.Sunak is being honest. Ultimately, all these ambitious climate targets - laudable as they may be - may be achievable, but not if we trash the place. He isn't going to trash the place with spiralling costs, unemployment and poverty. There's a neologism in the UK, \"cakeism\", which means you can't have your cake and eat it! Remember that. Nothing is for free!There are other policy areas where Sunak is starting to apply the blowtorch of reality. He says politicians have treated people to \"fairy tales\", that policies don't add up and the political class haven't levelled with the public. They've done the polling and promised nirvana. It's a fraud. It's a novel strategy, but inspiring.So back to my two friends and their questions. My judgment is the public won't write off the Liberal Party if it sticks to common sense and reality rather than tacking like a yacht to accommodate trends, fashions and fads. I don't know how many commentators have met young people, but my experience tells me they're not sure what the Liberal Party is about.How will it address climate change without imposing crippling costs on lower income people, how will it get young people in to their own homes rather than rentals including from the state, how will it encourage investment including into new technologies, and how will it ensure our creative arts and sports become a still more exciting part of our lives?As for the Yes campaign for the Voice, it's a related problem. They've run a campaign based on feelings and ideology, not reality. I noticed Yes posters springing up on Adelaide streets over the weekend. What do they say? Yes. That's it. Just the word Yes. Why is that persuasive? The Yes campaign needs to link the Voice and how it would work with outcomes. But they don't want to say how it would work, so how can voters link it with outcomes?I'm voting No anyway because I've seen the consequences in too many countries of ethnic and racial divisions. I want a diverse society built around a few core values and equality under the law. But that's just me. Many voters aren't familiar with ethnic rivalry in what was once Yugoslavia or religious divisions in India, nor are many familiar with the history of racial tensions nearer to home in Malaysia and Indonesia. For me, that explains why I'd never vote for a race-based chapter in our Constitution.But for most voters, they're looking for reality. They won't care what happens overseas. I understand that. And John Farnham and Cathy Freeman like it, but so what? One is a great singer and the other a great athlete. And Cathy Freeman beat the whole world without the Voice! So I told my friend, keep away from virtue signalling, moralising and sanctimonious lectures. Give the punters the facts.One of the greatest characteristics of Australians is their commitment to common sense. They don't like ideology and fancy theories. It's the best advice I can give to campaigners for political causes.Alexander Downer was Australia's longest serving foreign minister (1996-2007) and most recently Australian High Commissioner to the UK."
