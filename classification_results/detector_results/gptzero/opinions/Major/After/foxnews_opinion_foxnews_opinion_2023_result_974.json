But, as a presidential republic, America lacks a respected apolitical voice of integrity provided in Britain by its monarchy. Our often-misguided celebrities and social influencers let us down in this regard, more often than not.BBC ANNOUNCES POLICY CHANGE AFTER BACKLASH, WILL NOW LABEL HAMAS 'TERRORIST ORGANIZATION'The horrors committed by Hamashave focused the minds of many around the globe, sometimes in alarming ways. Consider the egregious handling of the conflict by many of our universities, and some of our U.S. news outlets.The royals showed their majesty by standing behind Israel in its time of need.

But electoral winds could challenge his laudable stance at any juncture.'BARGAINING CHIPS:' FAMED UK SPECIAL FORCES UNIT OFFERS HELP TO FIND HAMAS HOSTAGES, REPORT SAYSBritain is fortunate in its royal family to have a clear-eyed, benevolent element of society that reminds its people of their noble shared values. These values, under threat by extremists like Hamas, are the very principles of fairness and humanity that underpin liberal Western civilization.The royal family moved swiftly and courageously to condemn the appalling terrorist acts, and, unlike the BBC, did not hesitate to identify them as such. The palace’s statement reported that the king was: \"appalled by and condemns the barbaric acts of terrorism in Israel.\"Charles personally called Israeli President Isaac Herzog to express his condolences and solidarity. Herzog rightly expressed that the king’s call was an important gesture to Jewish people around the globe. This acknowledgment by Israel’s president underlines the king’s standing as a critical figure of global leadership, beyond just the borders of Britain or the commonwealth.Faithful to his role as head of nation, the king also held a private audience with Britain’s chief rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis to express his care and concern for the U.K.’s Jewish population.For their part, Prince and Princess of WalesWilliam and Kateissued a heartfelt statement condemning the Hamas attacks while recognizing, Israel’s \"right of self defence.\" Their distress over the unfolding events was palpable. Prince William went a step further by writing a letter to Ephraim, underlining his own solidarity with the Jewish community.The support for an embattled Israel was not limited to the royal family. It has been affirming to witness Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and a huge swathe of British parliamentarians, authors and public intellectuals express vocal and unambiguous support for Israel since the murderous Hamas attacks commenced. Along with the royal family, these enlightened voices also reinforce our great ally’s position and values in these times of global anxiety and despair.Princess of Wales Kate Middleton and the other royals have been willing to speak out for Israel and against terrorism.

An outstanding illustration is the lateQueen Elizabeth II’s responseto the 9/11 attacks.Just two days after the 2001 attacks, Queen Elizabethbroke with traditionand ordered the band of the Coldstream Guards to play \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" during the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace.Her majesty further demonstrated solidarity by attending a service of remembrance at St. Paul's Cathedral, where she ordered \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" to be played, wiping away a tear as thousands of churchgoers sang along.For their part, Prince and Princess of Wales William and Kate issued a heartfelt statement condemning the Hamas attacks while recognizing, Israel’s \"right of self defence.\" Their distress over the unfolding events was palpable. Prince William went a step further by writing a letter to Ephraim, underlining his own solidarity with the Jewish community.These actions, like the present royal family’s gestures of solidarity with those innocents — both Israelis and Palestinians — enduring loss and violence in the aftermath of the Hamas attacks, will never be forgotten.In turbulent times, the world craves moral clarity and a restored sense of stability. Risking public scrutiny, King Charles III and his family have risen to the occasion to shine a light on what is right, just and compassionate. The horrors of the October 7 attack are stark reminders that, though we live in relative peace and security, evil is very much at work remotely.In a world filled with complexities and chaos,the British monarchyserves an important purpose in reminding citizens of all civilized nations of our fundamental values, and the necessity to defend them at all costs.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LEE COHENLee Cohen, a senior fellow of the Bow Group and the Bruges Group, was adviser on Great Britain to the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee and founded the Congressional United Kingdom Caucus.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
