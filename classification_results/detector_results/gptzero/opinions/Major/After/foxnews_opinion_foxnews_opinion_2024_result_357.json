But he was absolutely correct.Will these same people laugh when I say my South Side neighborhood was better off in the 1960s? Look no further than former first ladyMichelle Obamafor evidence. Her first home was the Parkway Gardens, a massive living community next to my church. Back then, it was a working class community. Today, it is the projects.IF DEMOCRATS SAY THEY STAND WITH MY COMMUNITY, WHY ARE SO MANY STILL FAILING TO LEARN HOW TO READ?Theseliberal policies disincentivized marriage, steered us toward dependency on the government instead of upward mobility, and undermined the virtues of personal responsibility and agency.
