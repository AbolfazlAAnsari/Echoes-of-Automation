When will we rise from our sleep and take concrete actions to stop genocide unfolding in front of our eyes?Dr Munjed Farid Al QutobLondonClockwork OrangeI gather that a fast food chain is to play classical music to deter anti-social groups of youths. Let’s just hope the said disruptive types haven’t got round to reading A Clockwork Orange. (Anthony Burgess’s characters are immensely violent while also appreciative of fine music.)Cole DavisChalk Hill Road, NorwichThe Independent is telling it like it isTrying to work my way through the sludge and mire emanating from our government on a daily basis, and at the moment sadly from our police forces as well, it’s very refreshing to see The Independent, in its customary campaigning style, dare to say what should have been blindingly obvious long ago, that if we want satisfactory public services, we need to pay for them. And we can’t just keep on endlessly borrowing.I’ve been wondering recently whether it could be possible to redefine tax, to express it rather as a share, an investment bought, to fund the needs of our national community. Obviously not as simple as that, and the relationship between cost and value would be complex, but at least to approach the idea that a tax is not just money taken away from you, but your contribution towards making our country a safe, efficient and fair place for us all to live. And of course it would require a realistic belief in the ability of our government to spend it wisely, efficiently and effectively. A big ask.How much would it cost to enable our health service, our social care, our police, and all the other services currently provided by government to work efficiently and effectively, and ensure that no one has to live on a wage that cannot support a safe and secure standard of living? As you say, it doesn’t have to be world-class, we’re not in a competition trying to prove we’re better than everyone else. That can’t be achieved by shouting about it.We just need all these systems to work well enough. I’m fortunate not to have to worry about daily expenses and would happily pay more tax, buy more shares, if I could be confident that the requirement – could we drop the word burden? – would be fairly spread, and be genuinely related to our individual real wealth, not just the amount we’re prepared to admit to.We’re often told the rich and powerful, including the wealth creators, would leave the country if they were asked to pay more than they want to. I’m inclined to say if they don’t value their country any more than that, let them go. With a fairer society there could be many more entrepreneurs, creative people, and wealth creators who given the chance could take their places.David BucktonLinton, CambridgeDoes it matter if people choose private healthcare?This article is importantbut I fear it ignores a category of NHS funding patients who do not have any option of going private: those with chronic health conditions.I have haemochromatosis, a chronic condition, and currently, I am awaiting a much-needed hip replacement operation. I did seek a private consultation last year and the surgeon concerned straight away stated having the operation privately was out of the question due to my condition and the potential need for post-operative interventions if complications arise; something not possible in a private facility. So, my big worry is that by increasingly devaluing and diminishing NHS capability without a joined up approach covering both NHS and private provision we will end up with a NHS incapable of delivering vital emergency and elective procedures.Presently, I have been told my elective pathway is shut due to winter and strike pressures and I have no idea when my operation can take place. It is beyond time that the current problems facing medical and social care providers should have been addressed to achieve sustainable and effective service provision! The government’s excuses over strike resolutions and the plans for resolving matters are just plain pathetic.Meirion ReesWiltshire"
