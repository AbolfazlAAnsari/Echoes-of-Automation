And Alomar calmly described how hours earlier he had been woken by one of the strongest earthquakes to hit the region in more than a century.Once the initial quake had passed, the family fled their apartment building for snow-filled streets, dressed in their pajamas and armed with little more than mobile phones.For Alomar, a senior health adviser with theSyrian American Medical Society(SAMS), the priority now is providing medical assistance to northwest Syria.A decade of civil war has decimated infrastructure and impacted medical supplies in this region, Alomar told CNN. He said that vulnerable facilities will be tested further by an earthquake which has already claimed thousands of lives - and is expected to claim many more.This interview has been lightly edited for clarity. The views expressed in this commentary are Alomar's own.CNN:Describe the moment the earthquake struck.Dr. Abdurrahman Alomar:It happened at 4:17 a.m. I was here in Gaziantep, sleeping with my family.

Then we and other people in the building left in a hurry to the surrounding streets.There was no time to take anything - only my mobile phone and ID card.

About 45 minutes after the initial earthquake, there was another major aftershock, then a second and a third. And this was really very scary.Now I'm in my car, in an open place, far from the buildings and with my family.
