Portugal, Spain, Holland, France and Great Britain, burdened by debt, all experienced the sequencing of financial stress, armed services denigration and loss of reserve currency status. TheBiden administrationis propelling the U.S. toward this fate.The current administration's willingness to test the U.S. dollar's reserve currency status by ignoring our ballooning national debt is making the world a more dangerous place.To fix the problem, Congress must first send a signal to the markets that it is serious about fiscal responsibility. This will help improve our borrowing costs and gain us time.There are certainly outstanding questions about entitlement spending, but markets respond to signals first.  Committing to stringent long-term caps on discretionary outlays, ex-defense, would help calm debt markets, reassure allies, and bridge the gap to more responsible fiscal levels.America must remedy this internal financial threat before our adversaries move to test our capabilities on the battlefield and in the financial markets.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SCOTT BESSENTScott Bessent serves as chief executive officer and chief investment officer for Key Square Group LP,  a Connecticut-based investment partnership that he founded in 2015.
