Israel iscredibly accused of starvingthe 2 million people who remain, according to the UN special rapporteur on the right to food; a group of charity leaders warns that without adequate aid,hundreds of thousandsmore will soon likely join the dead.Yet Israel is still planning to invade Rafah, where themajority of people in Gaza have fled; UN officials have described the carnage that is expected to ensue as \"beyond imagination.\" In the West Bank, armed settlers and Israeli soldiers have killed Palestinians, includingUS citizens. These actions, which experts on genocidehave testifiedmeet the crime of genocide, are conducted with the diplomatic and military support of the US government.For the past year, I worked for the office devoted to promoting human rights in the Middle East. I believe strongly in the mission and in the important work of that office. However, as a representative of a government that is directly enabling what the International Court of Justice hassaid could plausibly be a genocidein Gaza, such work has become almost impossible. Unable to serve an administration that enables such atrocities, I have decided to resign from my position at the Department of State.Whatever credibility the United States had as an advocate for human rights hasalmost entirely vanishedsince the war began. Members of civil society have refused to respond to my efforts to contact them. Our office seeks to support journalists in the Middle East; yet when asked by NGOs if the US can help when Palestinian journalists are detained or killed in Gaza, I was disappointed that my government didn't do more to protect them. Ninety Palestinianjournalists in Gazahave been killed in the last five months, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. That is themost recorded in any single conflictsince the CPJ started collecting data in 1992.By resigning publicly, I am saddened by the knowledge that I likely foreclose a future at the State Department. I had not initially planned a public resignation. Because my time at State had been so short - I was hired on a two-year contract - I did not think I mattered enough to announce my resignation publicly. However, when I started to tell colleagues of my decision to resign, the response I heard repeatedly was, \"Please speak for us.\"Across the federal government, employees like me have tried for months to influence policy, both internally and,when that failed, publicly.My colleagues and I watched in horror as this administrationdelivered thousands of precision-guided munitions, bombs, small arms and other lethal aid to Israeland authorized thousands more, even bypassing Congress to do so. We are appalled by the administration's flagrant disregard for American laws thatprohibit the US from providing assistance to foreign militaries that engage in gross human rights violationsor thatrestrict the delivery of humanitarian aid.The Biden administration'sown policy states, \"The legitimacy of and public support for arms transfers among the populations of both the United States and recipient nations depends on the protection of civilians from harm, and the United States distinguishes itself from other potential sources of arms transfers by elevating the importance of protecting civilians.\" Yet this noble statement of policy has been directly in contradiction with the actions of the president who promulgated it.President Joe Biden himself indirectly admits that Israel is not protecting Palestiniancivilians from harm. Under pressure from some congressional Democrats, the administration issued a newpolicyto ensure that foreign military transfers don't violate relevant domestic and international laws.Yet just recently, the State Department ascertained thatIsrael is in compliancewith international law in the conduct of the war and in providing humanitarian assistance. To say this whenIsrael is preventing the adequate entrance of humanitarian aidand the US is being forced toair drop foodto starving Gazans, this finding makes a mockery of the administration's claims to care about the law or about the fate of innocent Palestinians.Some have arguedthat the US lacks influence over Israel. Yet Retired Israeli Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Bricknoted inNovember that Israel's missiles, bombs and airplanes all come from the US. \"The minute they turn off the tap, you can't keep fighting,\" he said. \"Everyone understands that we can't fight this war without the United States. Period.\"Even now, Israel isconsidering invadingLebanon, which brings a heightened risk of regional conflict thatwould be catastrophic. The US has sought to prevent this outcome but shows no appetite for withholding offensive weapons from Israel in order to compel greater restraint there or in Gaza. Biden's support for Israel's far-right government thus risks sparking a wider conflagration in the region, which could well put US troops in harm's way.So many of my colleagues feel betrayed. I write for myself but speak for many others, including Feds United for Peace, a group mobilizing for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza that represents federal workers in their personal capacities across the country, and across 30 federal agencies and departments. After four years of then-President Donald Trump'sefforts to cripple the department, State employees embracedBiden's pledgeto rebuild American diplomacy. For some, US support for Ukraine against Russia's illegal occupation and bombardment seemed to reestablish America's moral leadership. Yet the administration continues to enable Israel's illegal occupation and destruction of Gaza.I am haunted by thefinal social media postofAaron Bushnell, the 25-year-old US Air Force serviceman who self-immolated in front of the Israeli Embassy in Washington on February 25: \"Many of us like to ask ourselves, 'What would I do if I was alive during slavery? Or the Jim Crow South? Or apartheid? What would I do if my country was committing genocide?' The answer is, you're doing it. Right now.\"I can no longer continue what I was doing. I hope that my resignation can contribute to the many efforts to push the administration to withdraw support for Israel's war, for the sake of the 2 million Palestinians whose lives are at risk and for the sake of America's moral standing in the world.Opinion by Annelle ShelineTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
