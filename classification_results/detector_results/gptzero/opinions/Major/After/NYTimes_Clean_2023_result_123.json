            "inputText": "It's been a year since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. How are women across America's ideological spectrum thinking about abortion today? What's changed for them, and what hasn't? How does a person's relationship with a political issue change after such a surprising swerve like the end of a decades-old precedent?Those were some of the questions that led us to organize our latest Times Opinion focus group, which we decided to set in Kansas, a traditionally conservative but politically dynamic state that stunned the nation last August by voting in favor of abortion rights.A sense of genuine surprise surfaced time and again during the conversation with nine women, a mix of independents, Democrats and Republicans. There was the still-palpable surprise that the Supreme Court reversed Roe, surprise that a whopping 59 percent of voters in Kansas (which a couple of the women referred to as a Bible Belt state) affirmed support for abortion rights in a referendum and, in a few intense moments, surprise among some of the women about their own feelings and reactions to the issue of abortion.One Republican in the group, Margaret, spoke about her happiness after the court's decision but then described more complicated feelings as she listened to the news ''from the perspective of being a mom and having a daughter that was raped and having to advise her to take the pill to abort the baby.''Other women said the issue was not black-and-white for them. ''There's a lot of gray,'' said Allison, an independent. The women described how they grappled with the matter and how the Supreme Court's action changed both so much in terms of policy and political activism and so little in terms of divisions and arguments in the country.''It's been hard to kind of get back to where we were, because everybody had such strong opinions one way or the other,'' said Debbie, another Republican. Abortion, she said, ''does factor into how I'm going to vote, but at this point, I'm so confused as to how I'm going to vote. It's kind of all up in the air.''How do you think things in Kansas compare to the rest of the country?Margaret: I think Kansas is a control-freak state. They go against the will of the people on things like medical marijuana, crime, poverty.Sarah: We're a Bible Belt state. I was raised deeply, deeply Catholic in rural Kansas. Now I'm in Kansas City. There's more forward thinking, more open-mindedness. I love it here. But then there's also that dark kind of side of not talking about certain things. Nobody wants to deal with those darker issues. And I think a lot of them stem from religion, to be honest.Kyrna: I feel like Kansas itself doesn't really know who it is. There's lots of progressive thoughts trying to take root. People want to hang on to conservative roots that were there before.Moderator: Do you think of yourself as more pro-life or pro-choice? Do you feel either of those labels fits your view?Debbie: ''Pro-choice'' speaks for itself. I would get to make my own choice.Stacy: Pro-choice. It should be between a woman and her doctor.Molly: Pro-choice, except I don't like it being used for birth control. But I think a woman should be able to decide, especially if it's a 14-year-old or a victim of rape.Margaret: I really believe that the choice should be made before the baby is made. And if you make a baby, I think that baby should be allowed to come all the way to term. But I have a daughter that went into a third-trimester abortion. And I also have a daughter that took the -- what's that pill that they take after you've been raped? Like Molly said, if it's a situation where they've been raped, a teenager, I don't think she should have to bear that. I mean, I think that if she wants to, then we can help her.Allison: If I had to pick, I'd definitely say pro-choice. But those labels make it a very black-and-white situation. There's a lot of gray -- personal choices, religious choices, personal experiences.Ruby: I'd probably say pro-life. A lot of people are just using abortion as a form of birth control. There's also the choice of adoption.Adriana: I'm more pro-choice. I have also seen a video of a doctor performing an abortion. It's a horrible thing to see. But it's not my choice. It's that person. That's something they have to live with.Kyrna: I absolutely believe that the baby deserves the opportunity to live. I agree with Margaret, who said that choice should have been made before the baby was ever conceived.Sarah: I fall in the middle. You can call it Catholic guilt. I have five kids. I'm all about babies -- love them -- but the older I get, the more experiences I have, and the more trauma and suffering I see. And I wouldn't want my child to go through that. It becomes a personal choice.Moderator: We are coming up on the first anniversary of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, better known as the Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. Think back to last summer, when this decision was announced. How closely, if at all, did you follow the issue before Roe was overturned?Debbie: I didn't think about it before. But then when everything was in the news and people were putting signs in the yards, it definitely split up neighborhoods and neighbors and friends. And it's been hard to kind of get back to where we were, because everybody had such strong opinions one way or the other.Ruby: I didn't think about it as much before, either. All my friends, they're totally against what I think. I grew up in a Catholic family. We know in the Bible, that's not what God wants us to do.Stacy: I didn't think about it because everybody just had that right. It made me mad when they took it away. My daughter-in-law had an ectopic pregnancy two days before the ruling. If it would have happened after, they said they would not have known what to do. She could have died.Kyrna: I didn't really think about it. I never expected it to be overturned. The ruling very, very strongly affected the vote that we had in August. Signs were in yards.Sarah: Abortion has always been a part of a conversation in my life. My mom is a super-active pro-life person. I didn't think Roe v. Wade would be overturned, so I was kind of surprised after they took it away.In your view, what are the reasons some women might seek an abortion?Sarah: They're young, they were raped, there was incest, there are complications that are life-threatening.Allison: I know a young person who had an abortion two months ago. She was irresponsible. She had a boyfriend, and they had unprotected sex. And she used it as a form of birth control. But she said to herself, ''I'm not ready financially. I'm not ready with my college. I'm not ready to have a kid yet.'' So at least she made, in my opinion, a very responsible choice, to abort the child before she had it. Because I also teach in an area where I've got a lot of young, really, really young moms that had kids young. And now I teach those kids. The families are a mess. They're supporting the kids. They are working two or three jobs because they never went to college to further their careers. So it's difficult as an educator to be pro-life when I know not everybody is ready for children, even though children are my life.Molly: I would tag on to what Allison said. Lack of financial or family support are probably big reasons.Margaret: You could also have a family that's not receptive to your baby. That can cause a lot of problems.Stacy: People say, ''Oh, well, you can put it up for adoption.'' But maybe they don't want to put their body through that. Women die in childbirth. It's hard to carry for nine months, especially for a younger girl. And then to give up a born child to somebody is a lot on your psyche.Allison: I think that a lot of women turned out to vote who maybe had never voted before. I remember the county had lots of signs in the yards, lots of social media posts and all of that sort of stuff. A lot of them were suburban house moms that were feeling affected by the situation.Moderator: Have you or any of your loved ones, whether family members or close friends, experienced any changes in your life after this Supreme Court decision?Debbie: I have a 22-year-old daughter who was in a sorority at University of Kansas. They had so many friends that registered to vote because they wanted to vote on the issue.Kyrna: My husband works in a very liberal environment. He is pro-life like myself. And so that's been really weird. He had a pro-life magnet on his vehicle. And he had to remove it, while other people had the contrary magnets and weren't necessarily asked to remove them. So I feel like there's acceptance on one side but definitely not for both sides, which is really frustrating.Allison: My sister lives in California. She has a very skewed view of Kansas and how we vote. She was shocked that Kansas voted to keep it legal. She thought, ''No way was that going to happen, because of the podunk countryside of Kansas.''What are some other circumstances people think might warrant an exception to abortion being illegal?Ruby: If it's, like, the health of the mother, like ectopic pregnancy or something like that puts her life in danger.Margaret: Rape, incest and when the baby will be born with serious defects, like it doesn't have its arms or legs or its brain. I know that sounds so cruel. But by the same token, I just think that if you're raped, if you have incest, there's so many things that can go not right with that.Molly: Rape and if the mother's life is in jeopardy. And to Margaret's point on if there were abnormalities, I think that's where it's based on the individual. Some mothers -- and no judgment at all -- may not want to bring in a child with no arms or no legs. Other mothers might be like, ''This is a blessing,'' and look at it more as a ''glass half full'' situation. That's why it should be a woman's choice.Moderator: Is there anything that you wish more people knew about the way that someone like you thinks about this subject, something that you think would be surprising or maybe it doesn't get talked about that much?Kyrna: Some of the discussion we've had tonight has been about if someone were to get pregnant and it wasn't the right time or if they had been raped or just had unprotected sex, that maybe the emotional toll or positive mental well-being of them could be a factor in them choosing to get an abortion. But I absolutely see the flip side of that. They have to live with that decision for the rest of their life. I have a close friend who did get an abortion when she was 18. And she regrets it every single day of her life. She now is married and has four kids of her own. And life moved on. But she absolutely is still affected by that decision 20 years later and probably will be for the rest of her life. So I don't see the mental well-being necessarily being wholly improved by choosing to have an abortion.Sarah: I think a lot of times, the discussion around abortion is a distraction. I feel like when we are divided on a topic in our country, we should look deeper into what is going on in politics. These hot-button issues that are old and rehashed constantly, they want us to bicker and fight over. And it gets us all going. So look deeper into the underlying things.Moderator: How important is this issue to how you vote?Molly: I always vote, so it didn't really change the way I voted. But it made me kind of want to talk to people who maybe agreed with my politics who a lot of times didn't go vote. Like my mom, God love her. I would say: ''Please go vote. Make your voice heard.''Debbie: It does factor into how I'm going to vote, but at this point, I'm so confused as to how I'm going to vote. It's kind of all up in the air. My opinions are still the same, but the options that are out there -- I don't know what the heck I'm going to do.Sarah: Women are very important. But there are a lot of other issues. I'm not going to not vote for someone because they're pro-life or not vote for someone because they're pro-choice. I've moved on.Kyrna: Abortion has made me pay attention to politics differently. When it was overturned, Kansas then had to determine how we handle abortion versus it being a federal right. I pay more attention to the state and local level, right down to our City Council members, which I didn't necessarily do before.Allison: It's not a huge topic for me. There's a lot of other things going on in our country and in our state that are more of a top priority. But it definitely got a lot of people out there to vote, which I appreciate.Margaret: Abortion plays a pretty heavy role for me. I feel like the women in our country are being attacked, even trans women. It doesn't matter what kind of woman. Everybody else wants to make decisions for us. Why don't we get to make our own decisions?Stacy: I am past childbearing age, but I do have daughters-in-law. And so I would never vote for a non-pro-choice person, ever, because I feel it's about control."
