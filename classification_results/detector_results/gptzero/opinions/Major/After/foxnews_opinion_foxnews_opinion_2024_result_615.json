Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, or Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Congressman Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., or former national security adviser Ambassador Robert O’Brien. The last two can deliver the fundraising and the messaging as well as votes in Gallagher’s Wisconsin or the states of Arizona and Nevada, where O’Brien’s membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints brings some LDS votes to Trump, and it is a block with which he has trouble.If Trump goes the Full Monty and drops \"the list\" from which most, if not all, his senior appointees will be drawn — and yes, it is legal to do so — he will supercharge the election with surrogates who matter and who flood media platforms and fundraisers.TRUMP COULD WIN IOWA BUT VOTERS' SECOND CHOICE IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICALHere’s my fantasy draft of folks who couldhelp Trumparound the margins immediately, raise dough, appear on cable and could begin as early as Trump wills it. (Note: I’ve used all of the potential VPs in other jobs as only one can be down the hall from the Oval):Former President and Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump departs after speaking at a \"Commit to Caucus\" rally in Clinton, Iowa, on Jan. 6, 2024.(Tannen Maury/AFP via Getty Images)Secretary of State:O’Brien,Nikki HaleyDepartment of Defense:Pompeo, Gallagher, Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla.Secretaries of Navy, Army, Air Force:Gallagher, Waltz and Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, who are veterans of these services and know their own service. Whomever comes in should commit to four years of setting these branches right, deep selecting military leadership where necessary.Director of National Intelligence and Director of Central Intelligence:Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, Gallagher or WaltzAttorney General:Cotton, Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Josh Hawley R-Mo., or Eric Schmitt, R-Mo. (This has got to be a senator to assure rapid confirmation and they have to be indifferent to Beltway critics).Deputy Attorney General:Daniel Cameron, former attorney general of KentuckySolicitor General:Former Ambassador Christopher Landau2024 TRUMP-BIDEN REMATCH WILL BE AN ELECTION LIKE NO OTHERFBI:A former U.S. attorney like Stephen Cox or Tim Garrison (There are plenty of great former USAs who held office under Trump like these and who would, like these two, clean house on the top floor on day one and would not indulge agents with vendettas against Trump as James Comey permitted or encouraged).Treasury:Former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin or Virginia Gov. Glenn YoungkinFormer President Donald Trump on the campaign trail.(Scott Olson/Getty Images)OMB:Robert Lighthizer, former U.S. trade representative, Kevin Hassett, former senior adviser to the president, or Russ Hauth (provided Hauth committed to a 4% GDP defense budget).HHS:Dr. Jay Bhattacharya (and listen to him for the CDC and FDA).Department of Education:Hillsdale President Larry Arnn (There’s a reason the college’s monthly newsletter has 2 million subscribers), Arthur Brooks, Sen. JD Vance, Youngkin.Agriculture:North Dakota Gov. Doug BurgumCommerce:Former Ambassador Lewis Eisenberg, YoungkinWILL 2024 BE A CONTEST BETWEEN TWO LIGHTWEIGHTS PRETENDING TO BE HEAVYWEIGHTS?EPA:Andrew Wheeler, former EPA administratorOffice of the Trade Representative:Lighthizer or Matt Pottinger, former deputy national security adviser. Lighthizer did it before. If he gets promoted, Pottinger can deal with the Chinese better than anyone else.Office of Personnel Management:Stephen Miller, formerly Trump's senior adviser for policy. You would need a Senate majority, obviously, but if you are going to take on the administrative state, take it on. Visibly. With flags flying.Interior:Former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. He knows the issues and is extremely competent.Labor:Schmitt or Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.Energy:Dan Brouillette returns.HUD:Ben Carson returns or former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, who tackled homelessness in America’s finest city.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONTransportation:B. Marc Allen from Boeing or another senior and extremely competent and experienced transportation executive.The SCOTUS short list:Circuit Court Judges Amul Thapar, James Ho, Barbara Lagoa, Neomi Rao, Don Willett, Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, or Paul Clement (at 57, Clement is older but far and away the best qualified).Ambassador to China:Pottinger or LighthizerNational Endowment for the Humanities:Brooks orChristopher RufoNational Endowment for the Arts:Brooks or Carol Platt Liebau. (These two jobs are missionaries to the culture, high-profile ambassadors to the elites who have to out think the left every day and all three are extremely able to carry out that mission. Liebau was the managing editor of the Harvard Law Review when former President Obama was its \"president.\" She knows the score).White House Staff:Chief of Staff:Former AmbassadorRichard Grenell (You need an enforcer)National Security Advisor:O’Brien, Pottinger, John Noonan, Omri Ceren, Mary KisselCounsel to the President:(Ask Leonard Leo for a reliable D.C. heavyweight as a Don McGahn and Pat Cipollone were in the first term.)Comms Director:Jason MillerPress Secretary:Guy Benson and Mary Katharine HamCounselors to the President:Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Chris LaCivita, Susie WilesDomestic Policy Council:Lanhee ChenEconomic Policy Council:Larry Kudlow, Stephen MooreChair of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board:Retired Army Gen. Jack KeaneName them. Turn them loose on cable and to campaign and raise money. Win big. Trump gets the second term he wants and needs and the \"dictator is coming\" crowd looks really stupid.Hugh Hewitt is one of the country’s leading journalists of the center-right.
