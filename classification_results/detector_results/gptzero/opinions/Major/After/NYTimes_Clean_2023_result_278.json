Ukraine was the victim of unprovoked Russian aggression, while Gaza was the launching point for the most deadly attack against Jews since the Holocaust.Terrorizing civilians with missile strikes and other attacks is a core part of Russia’s war strategy, while Israel is forced to root out Hamas terrorists operating from civilian areas including schools, hospitals and mosques. The goal of the Ukrainians is to protect civilian lives and defeat the Russian military, while thegoal of Hamasis to provoke attacks against its own civilians to inspire worldwide condemnation.Gazan deaths are as tragic as Israeli deaths, and the goal should be to minimize or eliminate both. But to scoreboard this conflict based on death count, rather than Hamas tactics seeking to escalate it on both sides, misses the story, and helps prolong the tragedy.Stuart GottliebNew YorkThe writer teaches American foreign policy and international security at Columbia University.College in Prison ‘Changed My Life’To the Editor:Re “An Educational Revolution Is Beginning Behind Bars,” by Max Kenner (Opinion guest essay, Nov. 18):Mr. Kenner’s essay should prompt a dialogue about the many ways to reduce crime.I was a high school dropout with no prospects other than selling and using drugs. I went to prison and was convinced I should get my G.E.D. there. A program counselor saw my test scores and suggested I try a college class. That was all it took.Every book I read was another door opening. When I was released in 1991, instead of going back to the streets, I went tothe Fortune Societyand found a job while continuing my college education at Hunter.I could never have predicted what was ahead. I was honored as aChampion of Changein the Obama administration and appointed by the City Council to serve as vice chair on the Board of Correction, later becoming the first formerly incarcerated person in New York history to be namedfirst deputy commissioner of the New York City Department of Correction.And on Jan. 1, I will begin a new chapter as president and C.E.O. of the Fortune Society, the grandfather of re-entry programs, with a staff of 500 serving over 11,000 people.College in prison changed my life.Stanley RichardsBronxWhen the Office Is Too ComfortableTo the Editor:Re “The Allure of the Instagrammable Office” (Sunday Business, Nov. 26):Although an office should be designed to make it conducive to getting work done, sometimes the way to do this is not obvious and can backfire.When I was a graduate student, the department head purchased some very elegant chairs for the library. I assume he thought these chairs would induce students to spend more time studying in the library.Unfortunately, those chairs, as well as being elegant, were also very comfortable. They did, in fact, get me to spend more time in the library. But I spent most of that time not studying but asleep (with a book in my lap).Alice L.
