Mainly poor government policy. Consider the province's business tax system, which includes the highest total tax rate on businesses in Canada. In 2020, B.C.'s total business tax rate(https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/FMK2_2020-Tax-Competitiveness_Bazel_Mintz.pdf), including federal business taxes, was 25.6 per cent, almost two-thirds higher than the national average (15.6 per cent) and more than double the rate in neighbouring Alberta (12.1 per cent).On the regulatory front, a 2022 survey(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/annual-survey-of-mining-companies-2022) of mining companies ranked B.C. 27th of 62 jurisdictions around the world for mining investment attractiveness. A 2023 survey(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/canada-us-energy-sector-competitiveness-survey-2023) of petroleum companies ranked B.C. 15th among 17 jurisdictions in Canada and the U.S. in terms of its investment attractiveness. Survey respondents repeatedly cited the same three deterrents to investment: land claims, protected areas and environmental regulations.According to the B.C. government's own economic estimates(https://bcbc.com/insight/governments-own-modelling-shows-its-cleanbc-plan-will-dampen-economic-growth-and-set-b-c-s-prosperity-back-more-than-a-decade/), its regulations reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), known as CleanBC(https://cleanbc.gov.bc.ca/ ), will cost the province $28 billion in lost economic activity by 2030, which means that by the end of the decade British Columbians will be $4,600 poorer per person than they would be without these regulations.Which brings us back to the Eby government's plan(https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/vaughn-palmer-bc-ndp-quietly-consult-sweeping-changes-managing-public-lands) to co-manage all Crown land - which comprises 94 per cent of all land in province - in partnership with more than 200 First Nations.Right now British Columbians, via the provincial government they elect, are the final decision-makers about what happens on public lands - from how land is used for communications and electricity transmission towers to what sorts of mining, tourism, agriculture and transportation infrastructure can be built on it. The Land Act also covers lakes, rivers and the coastline, which impacts anything built on or having to do with water, including future hydro projects.It's hard to overstate how the proposed change would affect B.C.'s investment climate, particularly given the concerns that land claims and regulations have already created among potential investors. The province will become essentially out-of-bounds to investment in many industries that do business on Crown lands or water.Both the sheer magnitude of this plan and the uncertainty it will create deserve closer scrutiny by British Columbians, who should have a greater say in whether such revolutionary changes should go ahead. The Eby government clearly hopes to ram the bill through the legislature, with less than complete transparency and little public input and, crucially, without disclosing any analysis of the economic impact, which - make no mistake - will be widespread and profound.Stop China's neo-Marxist EV trade war(https://financialpost.com/opinion/stop-china-neo-marxist-ev-trade-war)Ottawa's EV timeline is way too optimistic(https://financialpost.com/opinion/ottawa-ev-timeline-way-too-optimistic)Cutting university budgets is messy and political(https://financialpost.com/opinion/cutting-university-budgets-messy-political)At a minimum, the government should delay these changes and allow a robust debate to occur. More fundamentally, British Columbians should decide on changes of this significance through the electoral process - with either an election or a referendum. That's how unprecedented and profound the move towards de facto First Nations co-ownership of all Crown land is to the future of British Columbia.Niels Veldhuis and Jason Clemens are analysts at the Fraser Institute.Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the business news you need to know - add financialpost.com(https://financialpost.com/ ) to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here(https://financialpost.com/newsletters/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2024 Postmedia Network Inc.
