He told me \"It’s nice, but there’s so many addicts, and we don’t know what to do about it.\"When I asked if the city could be doing more, he told me \"Maybe, but a lot of these people don’t want help.\"About 15 minutes later the ambulance pulled up. By that time the young man on the sidewalk had regained something resembling consciousness, his hand gently scratching the open sores on his neck.Casting an accusing glance at Andrew the paramedic barked, \"Did you call this in?\"\"No,\" the young man protested.\"I did,\" I said, \"He wasn’t moving, I couldn’t tell if he was breathing,\" almost forgetful that I was describing a human life.The EMT guy sighed, he pointed down the street to the sea of prone bodies as if to say, \"That’s everyone here.\"It was hard to blame him.SINALOA CARTEL EXPORTS FENTANYL ‘KITCHENS’ FROM MEXICO TO COLOMBIA AMID INTERNATIONAL CRACKDOWNHomeless people are seen on streets of the Kensington neighborhood as homelessness and drug addiction hit Philadelphia.((Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images))Making our way down the block towards the elevated train overpass you could see what he meant, a slow motion tragedy of people with loved ones somewhere who barely seemed awake or alive.One woman very clearly did not want to be on camera, \"Stop filming!,\" she yelled, \"Do you want to get kicked in the balls?\"I’d have taken the threat more seriously had I thought she was capable of standing up. As it was, I simply replied, \"I’d prefer not to.\"Incredibly, beneath the rattle of the elevated train above, rushing commuters beyond this nightmare, a hodgepodge of small businesses eke out some kind of impossible beat existence.Sneaker stores, a nail salon, some kind of dollar store with a sign in the window announcing \"no credit cards,\" they all sat like the set of some horrible play in which the actors were slowly dying out front.A small ways away, near McPherson Park I spoke to the son of the owner of J&R Grocery, he told me that yes, the diaspora of addicts mingling all about were an issue, but that, \"I make sure they stay off the stoop, we run a safe place for our customers.\"CRISIS IN KENSINGTON: IF 'GOOD OLD FASHION HEROIN' WAS BACK, LIFE WOULD BE BETTER RECOVERING, ADDICT SAYSRich and Peg shoot-up a mix of heroin and fentanyl on a street in Kensington on July 19, 2021 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.((Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images))To this son of a Kensington entrepreneur, and to so many who live in this place, it was all just so normal, just the wallpaper of their neighborhood, as if it is all just an inevitable reality.We all know there are no easy answers, butin Kensingtonthere are no answers at all, aside from two beat cops, which in fairness in more than I’ve seen in places like San Francisco and Los Angeles, where there was no semblance of city government.It was as if this place is meant to be its own kind of prison or asylum, where the destitute addicts are simply left alone to wither, and to die.Am I standing in the greatest nation on earth, one has to wonder amid the dark squalor and pain?
