The COVID-driven shift to remote work further exacerbated this trend and, thus far, higher oil prices have done little to move the needle in the opposite direction. Today, nearly a third(https://www.airdriecityview.com/alberta-news/alberta-ndp-promises-200-million-to-create-post-secondary-campus-in-downtown-calgary-6866836) of Calgary's downtown office space sits empty - almost twice the national average.Meanwhile, Calgary faces a crisis of a different sort in its residential housing market. With rental vacancies at a decade-long low(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-vacancy-2-7-percent-1.6727738), Calgary saw the largest increase(https://calgary.citynews.ca/2023/03/22/calgary-rent-growth-largest/) of rental prices among any major Canadian city this year. The average two-bedroom apartment in Calgary now goes for more than $2,000 per month, over 40 per cent more than the same space in Edmonton.The obvious way to \"square the circle\" would be to convert some of downtown Calgary's unused office space into affordable rental housing. Indeed, city hall has sought to do just this.The City of Calgary's Downtown Development Incentive Program(https://settlementcalgary.com/2021/08/18/calgarys-downtown-development-incentive-program/), launched in the summer of 2021, aims to \"support the revitalization of Calgary's downtown core\" by providing developers with grants to convert idle downtown office space into residential units. Earlier this year, the program was expanded to support the conversion of underused office space into hotels, schools, post-secondary campuses, and cultural spaces - as well as the demolition of unsalvageable office buildings.The city has set aside $153 million of taxpayer money(https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/city-announces-five-more-office-buildings-up-for-residential-conversion) for the conversions. Qualifying developers can get up to $75 per square foot for conversions, up to a limit of $15 million per project.Needing to make a big splash in Calgary, the Alberta NDP threw its weight(https://livewirecalgary.com/2023/05/11/alberta-ndp-promises-1-2-billion-in-capital-improvements-for-calgary/) behind this initiative last week; pledging $150 million for downtown revitalization as part of a three-year, $1.2-billion investment plan for the city. (The plan includes a further $205 million for affordable housing).\"There are fewer head offices here in Calgary than there were in 2019, and the city now has the highest downtown office vacancy rate in the country,\" NDP leader Rachel Notley said at an event in northwest Calgary last Thursday. \"We'll build a more vibrant downtown that attracts people to live here, to work here, to play, and to connect downtown.\"This all makes for great optics but, in practice, pouring more taxpayer money into \"downtown redevelopment\" will do little beyond lining the pockets of already well-heeled developers. The initiative will also add insult to injury for the owners of existing downtown residential spaces, who are just now seeing their property values recover after the double-whammy of collapsing oil prices and COVID.If there is a genuine business case for downtown residential projects, developers should be able finance these projects without government handouts. The city (much less the provincial government) has no business playing developer and interfering with the operation of free markets. City hall's role in downtown development should be limited to making the relevant zoning decisions.The best thing for vacant office space is vacant office space. With COVID now in our rear-view and work-from-home fatigue(https://fortune.com/well/2023/02/28/what-remote-work-does-to-your-brain-and-body/) setting in across multiple fields, demand for prime office space is expected to rebound strongly(https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/research/return-to-the-office#:~:text=Estimated%20demand%20for%20prime%20office,and%205.1%20million%20in%202025. ) over the next several years. Companies the world over will be looking for cheap urban office solutions. Calgary, which just last year was named the best place to live(https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/08/05/the-best-places-to-live-in-north-america) in North America by The Economist, will be a top destination for many of these companies.Like any major city, Calgary needs a balanced tax base to thrive. A property mix that skews too heavily toward residential housing will cause property taxes to skyrocket and young people to flee. (Look no further than Vancouver(https://globalnews.ca/news/9517073/city-of-vancouver-property-tax-increase-proposal-2023/) for an example). Calgary must grow its commercial tax base if it wants to remain a world-class city. To do this, it must continue to make its downtown core a welcoming space for corporate offices.Election year or not, the government has no cause to interfere in a fluid and fast-evolving post-COVID downtown Calgary. The city's downtown offices are already on the road to recovery(https://calgaryherald.com/business/local-business/downtown-offices-recovery-despite-headwinds) and ham-fisted intervention will only jeopardize this process. The government's role is to facilitate the functioning of the free market, not to choose which projects to develop.For now, the best way that Calgary's city hall and the Alberta government can help is by continuing to make critical investments in public safety(https://globalnews.ca/news/9601139/alberta-government-transit-street-safety-measures/) and crime reduction. Safe streets will do more than any government incentive program to revitalize Calgary's downtown core.Rahim Mohamed is a freelance writer based in Calgary.
