It has become a proxy for all kinds of issues where people feel that elites simply don't get the concerns of average people. And the concern is rooted in real facts on the ground.The US has taken in huge numbers of immigrants over the last five decades. In 1970, foreign-born people made up5.7%of the country. As of 2020, that number was 15.3%. And it's not just America. In Sweden, that number went from 6.6% in 1970 to 19.8% in 2020; in the UK, from 5.3% to 13.8%. As I note in my new book, \"Age of Revolutions,\" the Western world has seen a wave of unprecedented migration. Considering the numbers and the cultural diversity of the immigrants, people have been remarkably tolerant.In both the EU and the United States, gangs and cartels have recognized that they can game the asylum system by bringing in migrants who are moving for economic reasons but who apply for asylum, claiming that they are being persecuted at home - and thus get the right to stay, have legal hearingsandeventuallywork. Last fiscal year, nearly a million peopleappliedforasylumin the US. In the EU last year, that number was more than1.1 million.The waves of recent migrants have produced problems as anyone on the ground can confirm, from New York City toEl Pasoto Stockholm. Sweden today is home to one of the highest gun crime deathratesin Europe. And it is not a coincidence that its second largest political party is one that traces itsrootsto World War II-era fascism.The Biden administration has made the case that it has put in place a set of well-craftedpoliciesto limit asylum-seekers, that it needs Congressional action to do more and that Republicans want thisproblemto fester so that they can reap its electoral benefits. (They even tried to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on utterly bogus charges. The Democratic-majority Senatequickly put a stop tothat effort.) All true.But Biden must show he can fight. He should declare a national security emergency, send the National Guard to the border, work with Congress to suspend the asylum process and propose a new one that basically makes it impossible to get asylum if you just show up at the border. Many will scream, and it will all be challenged in court. But it will signal that Biden is taking the problem seriously.Bill ClintonoftensaysthattheAmerican people don't always need you to succeed, but they want to catch you trying. Joe Biden needs to be caught trying to solve the immigration crisis.Opinion by Fareed ZakariaTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
