But what about art and creativity?Arts education in schools has been cut to shreds. No paint, no materials, no status, no nothing. A situation made worse by the government’s50 per cent funding cutto university arts subsidies in 2021.Last summer, Labour committed to make creative education compulsory to the age of 16. Now we need some detail to back that up.Let’s recognise the potential of all the arts to nurture self-esteem and creative expression in young people, and help them find their voice in the world. High-quality arts education is indispensable. It’s part of the reason why our creative industries are sensationally good. And it shapes our society for the better.In two weeks’ time, the winner of this year’sYoung London Print Prizewill be revealed. This is a competition where young Londoners express their personal response to the climate crisis through the medium of printmaking.Seeing their art shone onto the lights at Piccadilly Circus shows us a future full of colour and hope. That’s what you get by investing in art.Matt BellChair of Woolwich Contemporary Print Fair and co-founder of the Young London Print PrizeProtect the innocent – everywhereYou don’t need to have any particular connection with the people ofIsraelto be horrified by the latest Hamas attack.But the harm done by the Israeli government to the trapped occupants of Gaza is now comparable, and you also don’t need to have any particular connection with the people ofPalestineto be horrified by that either.Forgive the cliche, but two wrongs really do not make a right. There are grievous wrongs being perpetrated by both sides. The government of Israel, supported prominently by the US, is committing war crimes. And the victims are innocent civilians, Israeli and Palestinian.It’s incumbent on the rest of the world to use any legal and humane means possible to prevent further bloodshed.Susan AlexanderSouth GloucestershireWhen blue sees redIf Labour have proved anything this week it is that they are now clearly a government in waiting.Speaker after speaker (from Angela Rayner on Sunday to Ed Miliband on Monday and Sir Keir Starmer on Tuesday) have boldly presented what amounts to a clinical “timetable for action”. Action on waste. Action on fraud. Action on dodgy contracts. AnEnergy Independence Act.  Cutting NHS waiting lists. Building 1.5 million new homes. Breaking down barriers to opportunity. And instead of looking after the richest one per cent, looking after everybody in all walks of life.No wonder former Tories like me are turning to Labour in their droves.Downing Street under the Tories is a war zone. Downing Street under Labour will be an action zone.Geoffrey BrookingHampshire"
