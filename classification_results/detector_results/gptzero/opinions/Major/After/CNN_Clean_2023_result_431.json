            "inputText": "(CNN) &#8212; Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis recently attacked his leading competitor for the Republican presidential nomination, former President Donald Trump, from an unusual angle. In an interview earlier this month with radio host Hugh Hewitt, DeSantisvowedto do \"better\" than Trump in making Supreme Court appointments: \"I respect the three appointees he did, but none of those three are at the same level of Justice (Clarence) Thomas and Justice (Samuel) Alito.\"Liberals may be tempted to dismiss these comments as meaningless campaign bluster. They shouldn't.DeSantis has appointedfar more extreme justices to the Florida Supreme Court than Trump did to the US Supreme Court. And DeSantis's appointees - not Trump's - reflect theascendant wingof theconservative legal movement.DeSantis' judicial appointments don't follow the molds of the justices Trump appointed: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Instead, theyemulate Thomas and Alito, appointed by Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, respectively.According tojudicial ideological assessments, the pair is clearly further to the right. Trump's trio, despite being among the most conservative justices in Americanhistory, are comparative moderates in their temperament, constitutional philosophy and conception of the judicial role.The divide was clear in a ruling made earlier this month. In Haaland v. Brackeen, Barrett wrote the decision upholding a 1978 law aimed at preserving Native American adoptees' ties to their tribes and traditions. She was joined byKavanaugh and Gorsuch, with Thomas and Alitosharply dissenting.Consider these justices' varying views on stare decisis, the legal doctrine that holds courts should adhere to previously decided cases. Thomas has made clear that hedoesn't believe in it. If a past ruling is \"demonstrably erroneous\" - i.e., it conflicts with his personal understanding of the \"original meaning\" of constitutional provisions - Thomassaysit should be cast aside.Alito's rulings, alternatively, put apartisanpatinaon Thomas' approach: When stare decisis has stood in the way of reaching a desired outcome - as 1973'sRoe v. Wadedid to Alito's decades-longquestto wipe away the right to abortion, or as1977's Abood v. Detroit Board of Educationdid to hislong-standingskepticismof labor unions - he has ignored it. When stare decisis has facilitated a desired outcome - asApodaca v. Oregondid for hispushto make it easier forprosecutorsto secure criminal convictions - hehas applaudedit.LikeTrump's appointments, DeSantis' appointees -Carlos Muniz,John Couriel,Jamie Grosshans,Renatha FrancisandMeredith Sasso- have ties to the Federalist Society. But DeSantis' appointees to the Florida Supreme Court embrace the Thomas-Alito wing of the organization.Throwing caution to the wind and legal precedent to the bonfire, they've quicklyoverturnedscores of decisions, remaking everything fromdeath penalty jurisprudencetotort law. In 2020, they officiallyabandonedthe legal framework that required a special justification to overturn precedent,citingThomas' writings.Kavanaugh and Barrett aren't paragons of restraint when it comes to precedent. Both joined Alito'sopinionoverturning Roe. But they don't exhibit the same slash-and-burn arrogance. Kavanaugh hasdirectly challenged Thomas' viewson stare decisis. Barrett has alsoeschewedthe Thomas-Alito-DeSantis playbook. Overall, both show a bit morehumility,deliberationandmoderationand a lot less belligerence.Kavanaugh's commitment to stare decisis has led to surprising outcomes this term. In late May, he refused to sign on to Alito'sopinioncurbing the EPA's authority to protect wetlands, arguing that Alito's opinion departed from precedent. And, last week,Kavanaugh joined the majorityto hold that the Voting Rights Act required Alabama to draw another majority-Black congressional district. Why? Stare decisis, as he explained in his concurrence.DeSantis' appointees, in contrast, have jumped at entrenching conservative electoral domination and curtailing Black political power. Ignoring existing law, DeSantis' justices haverubber-stampedthe governor's extreme gerrymandering of congressional districts, which dismantled a majority-Black district;blessedDeSantis' plot to gut a voter initiative that restored voting rights to felons; and blocked progressive initiatives, includinglegalizing marijuanaandbanning assault weapons, from appearing on the ballot.Imitating Thomas and Alito, DeSantis' appointees have rushed into gratuitous political controversies, writing opinionsheavyon theory andlighton practicality. Barrett and Kavanaugh have been more pragmatic, taking into account functional considerations as well as outcomes.In January 2022, Kavanaugh joined anopinionallowing theBiden administrationto require certain employees at facilities receiving federal funding to get vaccinated against Covid-19. The decision stressed the \"scale and scope\" of the pandemic. And in the recentdecisionaffirming Congress' power to enact a federal law that gives relatives and tribes priority in the foster care and adoption of Native American children, Barrett carefully reviewed precedent and the complexities of America's child welfare system.Similarly, in 2020's Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, they bothrejectedAlito's fierce pleading to slay Employment Division v. Smith, aprecedent loathedby thereligious rightbecause itmakesit harder for people and institutions to demonstrate they are entitled to religious exemptions. As Barrett wrote, \"There would be a number of issues to work through if Smith were overruled.\"By contrast, the DeSantis court has indulged the most outlandish theories of the legal right. In December, itapprovedDeSantis' breathtaking request to impanel a statewide grand jury to investigate unspecified \"wrongdoing\" related to the Covid vaccines. Alito and Thomas have similarlypromoted anti-vaccinerhetoric. Thomas (and to alesserextent, Alito) alsoagitatedto hear cases based on Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" delusion that he had won the 2020 presidential election. Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett have hadnopatiencefor these canards.Gorsuch, for his part, is more closely aligned with Alito and Thomas than with Barrett or Kavanaugh. But he's shown a type of unpredictability alien to DeSantis' nominees, whovote togetherin politically charged cases. He'semergedas the court's strongest champion of Native American rights and, over thedissentsof Thomas and Alito,votedrepeatedlyto let legal investigations into Trump proceed.Gorsuch's rigidtextualismhas also led him away from the party line in a seminalLGBTQ rightscase and in cases involvingcriminal procedureandimmigrants.DeSantis loathes this independent streak,sayingin 2022 that one of the \"frustrating things\" about today's Supreme Court is that \"in these high-profile cases, you know those three liberal justices will vote the same every single time,\" whereas on the conservative side, there aren't \"the same guarantees.\" His claim of liberal groupthink wasoff-basebut still revealing: DeSantis wants conservative judges to rule in lockstep.I write asno fanofTrump's appointees. We shouldn't downplay a forest fire by pointing to the explosive bursts of a fiery volcano; both will burn. Yet it's a mistake for my fellow liberals to think of the conservative legal movement as a monolith, or assume the Supreme Court has reached rock bottom just because the current court is a horror show largely of Trump's making. It's not just intellectually lazy but also increasingly dangerous to lump all of theFederalist Society's factions together.Animperialflank of this movement wants to use the courts to impose a conservative agenda that has until now not been unachievable through legislation, and empowers the judicial branch above the others in enacting it. Thomas and Alito are in this vanguard, as are DeSantis' appointees and some of Trump's lower court appointees, with which DeSantis isaligned.Signssuggest a vengeful Trump could be, too, if returned to the White House.Trump's three appointments to the Supreme Court haven't fully joined the crusade. This isn't a testament to their moderation; it instead reflects the extremism of the others. But it doesn't make this distinction any less real.
