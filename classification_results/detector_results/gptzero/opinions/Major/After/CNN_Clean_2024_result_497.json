It was a fair point, and once again the lawyer landed blows.Cohen wavered, replying that he \"believe[d]\" he spoke to Trump. Like a punch landing, it staggered him - but he ultimately maintained his position about nature of the call. It happened. \"That was a lie, you did not talk to President Trump - you talked to Keith Schiller, you can admit it,\" Blanchesaid, voice raised. \"No sir, I don't know that it's accurate,\" Cohen responded, standing his ground.I was watching the jury throughout the day, and in particular when the cross-examination was at its most intense, as on this point. Their scrutiny of Cohen and of Blanche was as intense as the questioning itself, at least at its hotter moments. Unlike prior points when their attitudes appeared more transparent - such as when Cohen candidlyspoke directly to jurorsTuesday about his regrets for things he did out of loyalty to Trump - I could not read what they thought today.Trials, like boxing matches, are about momentum - and the defense got some in that exchange. But no further punches landed on the chin in the afternoon as Cohen better withstood the onslaught. Moreover, my experience has been that juries don't decide based upon one moment - they base their judgment on an overall view.And we are not done with Cohen. The prosecution on direct examination and throughout the case hasmeticulously corroboratedhim. On Monday, cross-examination will finish. When the prosecution comes back on redirect, they will refresh that corroborating evidence once more.Today was not sufficient to reverse theproof beyond a reasonable doubt that has been establishedover the weeks of the case in chief. The defense needed a knockout punch because they were behind on points and didn't get one. But it is a closer case.Opinion by Norman EisenTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
