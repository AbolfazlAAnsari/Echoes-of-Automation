Millions of people around the globe used them. Jobs was an actor-portrayed character but just one of a bunch of tech characters in a TV-movie \"Pirates of Silicon Valley\" in 1999; and he was central in apanned2013 film \"Jobs.\" But he only got the full-on Hollywood treatment in 2015's \"Steve Jobs\" - Sorkin wrote that one too.The TV series about Elizabeth Holmes, \"The Dropout,\" which Amanda Seyfried won anEmmyfor, is what really put a new spin on the tech tale: total failure. Holmes was the tech/disruptor/money-magnet wunderkind whose invention - a device to diagnose every illness short of hangnails from one drop of blood - was actually relying onthird-party devices. She faked her way into becoming a talked-about cultural phenomenon.The added element was the scam: Get the greedy suckers to buy into the faux innovation and fleece your way to fame and fortune.SBF is just the newest entry in that category. His defenders, including, at least in a mixed way, Lewis, see that as somewhat unfair. (A review of his book inThe New York Timesnotes that \"Lewis seems so attached to the protagonist of his narrative that he takes an awful lot in stride.\") Lewis, in the \"60 Minutes\" piece, suggested SBF was no Ponzi-schemer; he said Sam had a real business that would still be making fistfuls of money if there hadn't been a run on customer deposits. And after all, Sam was trying to use his wealth for good, funding all kinds of causes, and even trying to keep Donald Trump from destroying democracy. (SBF's alleged plan was to buy Trump off from running again with a $5 billion check.)As for the charges of self-dealing in selling and buyingcryptocurrency, resulting in the disappearance of$8 billion, the defense seems to come down to Bankman-Fried was not venal but sloppy, not evil but weird.In the interview \"60 Minutes\" did with Lewis, SBF was seen jiggling his leg and shuffling playing cards excessively, while he never made eye contact. And then there was the account from his ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison (now expected to be thestar witnessagainst him) that Sam described himself as lacking asoul.Of course, if FTX hadn't flamed out, all that would have just been part of the adorable legend of the richest guy under 30.Opinion by Bill CarterTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
