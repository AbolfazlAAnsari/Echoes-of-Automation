The number wasn’t huge, which is thought to reflect the cost and the taboo of the Zurich clinic, but it was telling: the majority of people going to Dignitas are from countries where there are laws against assisted dying – Germany, France, the UK (Germanyoverhauledits law in 2020, France is in the process of doing so). People who are given the choice of where and when to die do not go to Switzerland, they die at home.Giving evidence to the Commons investigation, one Dignitas employee described how medics tended to be in favour of assisted dying, but stayed quiet about it, “for fear of repercussions”. This code of silence is steadily breaking down: after surveying their members, the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons have alldropped their oppositionto assisted dying, and adopted a position of neutrality.Sarah Wootton, the chief executive of Dignity in Dying, hopes 2024 will be a tipping point, as legislation in Scotland, Jersey and the Isle of Man offers a realistic prospect that some Britons will have the right to die by 2025. There is no shortage of appetite for change, but the block, as Rantzen correctly identifies, is parliament. She is right to push for a free vote; she is right to speak openly about her experience, her wishes. Yet the real tragedy of this question is that it is left to people who are dying to spend their final months as their own beseeching advocates.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist                                                                                                           Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
