Even conservative media personality Megyn Kelly - who interviewed Trump one-on-one in September - recentlystatedon Glenn Beck's radio show that \"there's no question that Trump has lost a step, or multiple steps,\" as she ticked off some of his recent mental errors, including repeatedly confusing Biden with former President Barack Obama.Then there is Haley's demand that Trump debate her, a matter which in my view is not unrelated to the issue of Trump's mental acuity.If Trump were to take the debate stage, voters would have the chance to hear him responding live to questions and would be in a better position to assess his mental sharpness. Trump's refusal to debate during the GOP primaries so far has deprived the nation that opportunity. Indeed, before Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the GOP presidential race, his campaignsuggestedthat a lack of mental sharpness by the former president might be the reason \"his handlers won't let him debate.\"Trump's refusal to take part in any debates so far points to a broader issue: his repeated rejection of the trappings of our democracy. Trump became the first president inmore than 150 years to refuseto attend the swearing-in of his successor. He hastrafficked in falsehoodsandmocked the military serviceof war heroes.But Trump has gone well beyond rejecting democratic norms. He has rejected democracy itself with his alleged efforts after the 2020 election to prevent the peaceful transfer of power, for which he is now facing numerous felony charges in federal and state courts, although he denies having done anything wrong. It's a far lesser transgression, but Trump's refusal to debate Haley should be viewed by all Americans through that prism.With increasing frequency, \"SNL\" and late night comedians likeStephen Colbertare highlighting Trump's mistakes in their jokes, keeping the issue current in pop culture. Given that Trump would become commander in chief if he wins the presidency, journalists must also dig deeper on this topic.Reporters need to delve further into what's behind Trump's jaw-dropping gaffes and his alarming rejection of democratic norms. The stakes are far too high for our nation to overlook these issues.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
