For many Indian Americans and many Anglo Indians like me, Ramaswamy's line of attack might not seem particularly surprising.The sad fact is that Indians have beendenigrating one another for centuries, especially since colonial rule, when theBritish used the castesystem to divide and conquer the Indian subcontinent. A look at theterrible treatmentof India's200 million Muslimsby the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is a Hindu, shows us that the strategy continues to be employed in India with some effectiveness as he claims \"there's no place for discrimination in India.\"But why would Ramaswamy - himself the child of Indian immigrants - resort to an implied dig over race and ethnicity while running for the presidency of this country?
