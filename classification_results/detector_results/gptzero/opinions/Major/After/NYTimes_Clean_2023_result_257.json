However, I must disagree with him and Prof. Stephen Gillers that lawyers rarely face punishment for their transgressions.Every state has adopted a written code of ethics and established an independent professional responsibility board. Supported by annual bar dues, these agencies investigate and prosecute cases of lawyer misconduct, and they do so robustly and impartially. The days of the legal “club” are long over.Joseph BermanBostonThe writer is general counsel for the Board of Bar Overseers of Massachusetts and former president of the National Council of Lawyer Disciplinary Boards.To the Editor:The headline on Jesse Wegman’s excellent article obscures one critical thing. Donald Trump’s lawyers did know better, as did Nixon’s. The problem was not that they did not know; it was that they did not care.That is the problem that the legal profession and the public face.Don DoernbergPenn Valley, Calif.Trump Fraud TrialTo the Editor:Re “Trump Son Denies Ties to Reports on Finances” (news article, Nov. 2), about Donald Trump Jr.’s testimony in a fraud case:I ask you … where can I find a job as an executive vice president of a company without having to know anything about the company’s financial statements?Clifford ReissRiverview, Fla.Health Care BurnoutTo the Editor:Re “Burnout Among Health Care Workers Soared After Pandemic Hit, C.D.C. Finds” (news article, Oct. 26):We appreciate the growing recognition that supporting the mental health and well-being of the health care work force has reached a crisis point and requires both individual and systemic interventions. Fortunately, there are concrete actions that individuals and organizations can take.For example, one of the often cited reasons health care workers express hesitation in seeking mental health services is perceived professional repercussions.Many health care leaders and state medical boards are removing stigmatizing language regarding mental health care from health system credentialing and state licensure applications to help address this — but not enough.We encourage every individual, licensing board and health system that has made public commitments to supporting health care work force well-being to review, and revise as necessary, how questions related to seeking mental health care are asked within their organizations and by their state medical board.We believe that this action would remove at least this specific barrier to seeking mental health care for a vast number of physicians and nurses in the United States.Saranya LoehrerEileen BarrettThe writers are physicians.Hasan Minhaj, Truth and ComedyTo the Editor:“Hasan Minhaj Addresses Embellished Stories Detailed by The New Yorker” (Arts, nytimes.com, Oct. 26) covers the backlash to Mr. Minhaj’s artistic liberties in his comedy specials. While I understand getting mad, doing so misses the point. When I buy a ticket at a stand-up show, I’m not paying for news. I’m paying to laugh.Mr. Minhaj changed some details about real-life events to make difficult stories understandable and entertaining. Critics cite his participation in “The Daily Show” and the Netflix show “Patriot Act,” but this doesn’t mean that every performance of his must be factual news. In stand-up, if it’s funny, it’s fair game. They’re different formats, and audiences can tell the difference.When poets or authors or painters evoke emotional responses to real-life issues as effectively as Mr. Minhaj did, they’re celebrated for their brilliance. Why is it suddenly wrong when it’s a comedian?Alexander K. MatherFairfax Station, Va.This article appeared in print on page A19."
