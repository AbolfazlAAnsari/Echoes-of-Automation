And never mind that a forced Ukrainian peace plan wouldn't appear to be matched by any overtures from the Kremlin, likely resulting in more war later just as the West's failure to firmly respond to Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014-2015 set the stage for its invasion in 2022.All of which means that the West needs to plan for the possibility of the war lasting several years to maximize the chances of either driving Russia out militarily or convincing Russian President Vladimir Putin that his waiting game is a losing one.Giving up after a lackluster summer would be a mistake, even if elements of theGOP are being less supportiveand the recent India-hosted G20 summit, whichfailed to issue a communique reiteratingthe prior year's explicit condemnation of Russia's invasion, underscored the challenge of international assistance beyond the West.It's true that the Ukrainian counteroffensivedebuted with conspicuous setbacksandhasn't advanced as much as hoped. Russia's military didcorrect some mistakes from 2022, and whenUkraine's newly Western-trainedand -equipped (but inexperienced) brigades launched the counteroffensive in June, they discovered that Russian minefields weretoo dense and deepto breach quickly enough using mine-clearing vehicles before Russian drones, artillery andattack helicopterscould detect and target them. Above all, Ukraine didn't have nearly enough vehicles to absorb the losses.But then, Ukraine's military quickly switched to the slower attrition warfare to which it was accustomed. Engineers carefullycleared lanes through vast minefields on foot. Meanwhile, Kyiv's troops used artillery superiority, newly won thanks to Western deliveries of weapons, to methodically grind away at Russian batteries and manpower. Ukrainian troops manage to advance an average of700 to 1,200 meters every five daysusing these methods, according to a special report by the British  Royal United Services Institute think tank.Entering September, the counteroffensive still has the potential to achieve important intermediate goals. At present, Ukraine has a couple of months left before it risks running out of the needed artillery shells, fresh combat units and time beforemuddy fall weatherrenders further major offensive operations at least temporarily unviable.Ukraine's slow progress in part reflects arisky Russian strategy to \"defend forward\"rather than taking advantage of the multiple layers of their defenses to fall back. This denied Ukraine initially easier territorial gains at the cost of heavier Russian losses. But some analysts believe Russia may finally be running low on units to hold the line, and that deeper defensive lines are much less robustly defended than the forward ones.In August, Ukraine also finally committed elite brigades it was holding in reserve, in hopes of breaking through Russian lines first. In a large battle over the small village of Robotyne, theyovercame Russian forces there and then began flanking eastwardstoward Verbove, which could help Ukraine chisel a path towards key cities including Tokmak and, ultimately, Melitopol.At the same time, Russia's ability tocapture or recapture Ukrainian territory this winter seems limited, giventhe failures of its previous, wasteful winter offensive, its losses suffered this summer and thereliably poor leadership of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and general staff chief Valery Gerasimov.Thus, if Kyiv can retain its gains and avoid excessive losses and shell expenditures, it could continue to creep south toward Melitopol to cut the land bridge to Russia's strategic bases and port in Crimea.To be clear, Kyiv's desire to liberate territory isn't some quixotic quest of national honor. Ukrainians in occupied communities have reportedly been subject totorture, mutilation, sexual violenceand execution, while thousands of children have beenforcibly removed from their families and deported to Russia. Moreover, land seized by Russia earlier has been used to strikeever deeper into Ukraine, making restoring defensible borders an existential concern.To give Ukraine its best shot at liberating regions occupied by Russia since 2022, Washington and NATO need to work out multi-year plans to sustain military assistance - above all artillery systems and ammunition, followed by air defenses, drones and armored vehicles. As stores ofeasily donated equipment from the West dry up, new large-scale production and procurement orders funded by the US and its allies must be stepped up.Western assistance, combined with Ukrainian courage, have helped Kyiv's forces persevere in an exceptionally tough fight. Following on its boost to Ukraine's artillery, in July the Biden administration began crucial supplies to Ukraine from itslarge stocks of controversial cluster artillery shells- a difficult decision as cluster shells leave behind long-lasting hazards to clear post-battle. But Kyiv got the ammunition needed tosustain the counteroffensive longerwhile awaiting expanded factory production of conventional shells in 2024.Meanwhile, Western armored vehicles sharply reduced casualties to crew and passengers in vehicles that were hit, whileFrench and British cruise missilesdelivered effective strikes on Russian command centers and ammunition dumps as far as Crimea.Looking ahead, the US should sustain deliveries of shells and rockets as well as Bradley fighting vehicles (credited with playing a key role at Robotyne). And thebattalion of 31 Abrams tankssoon arriving in Ukraine should be followed by many more.Those tanks will come with depleted uranium ammunition, but despite widespread claims to the contrary, multiple studies havenot found these to pose health risksworse than regular anti-tank shells. Washington should also consider contributing longer-range missiles like the ATACMS missilethe Biden administration,according to some insiders, may be on the verge of authorizing.Then there's the matter of overcomingendemic foot-dragging in rebuilding Ukraine's air forcedespite commitments to finally give UkraineF-16A jets. These arenot wonder weapons, but a vital steppingstone to helping Ukraine eventually build a modern, Western-equipped air force. NATO training must alsoimprove in both quantity and quality, including crash courses for senior Ukrainian command staffs on planning large, complex operations thatUkraine's military struggles to execute.Let there be no mistake - the war ahead remains a horror. But by helping Ukrainians liberate their territory, the US furthers its own interests in defeating Russian aggression in Europe and demonstrating the high potential costs of wars of conquests targeting US partners.Putin miscalculated disastrously when he invaded in Ukraine, so he's now hoping to outlast Western support for Ukraine to rescue what spoils he can. Moscow's elite particularlywant to hold out through 2024in hopes that former President Donald Trump retakes office and cuts aid asopposition to support Ukraine growswithin the GOP.But folding in the face of manageable setbacks can be fatally self-defeating. During the American Civil War, Gen. George McClellan famouslyran against Lincoln on a platform favoring peace with the Confederacy- even though the South's total surrender at Appomattox followed just months later. Imagine how a successful McClellan \"peace\" plan could have inevitably led to more wars, indefensible oppression and bloodshed.The high cost of defeating Putin's invasion is lamentable. But failing to do so now could entail the US, Europe and Ukraine paying a much higher price later.Opinion by Sebastien RoblinTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
