I asked about similar reviews of Ford(https://www.taxpayer.com/media/FOI%20-%20Ford%20Emissions.pdf) and Bombardier(https://www.taxpayer.com/media/FOI%20-%20Bombardier2.pdf) before Ottawa handed them millions of dollars in subsidies and loans. The two firms literally create vehicles that burn oil and gas products, but Ottawa was not concerned about their emissions.That was six years ago. More recently, SecondStreet.org filed new requests with Ottawa to see if anything had changed in terms of upstream and downstream emissions reviews for foreign oil and gas. The answer from Ottawa was still \"no.\"(https://secondstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Upstream-and-Downstream-Emissions-%E2%80%93-Environment-Canada.pdf) They have no such records. Foreign oil continues to receive a free pass.A different and wiser approach for Ottawa would be to build more pipelines, not only because they're more environmentally friendly than rail, but because selling our natural gas to coal-dependent countries helps them reduce their emissions; generating power with natural gas produces about half the emissions that using coal does.Opinion: Alarming drop in mining derails drive for Net Zero(https://financialpost.com/opinion/mining-decline-derails-drive-net-zero)Opinion: New rail regulations will hurt the freight delivery system(https://financialpost.com/opinion/canada-new-rail-regulations-hurt-freight-delivery-system)Opinion: Ottawa's fertilizer controls may mean 'no business case' for feeding the world(https://financialpost.com/opinion/ottawa-fertilizer-controls-may-mean-no-business-case-feeding-world)Ottawa could even devote some of the billions in tax dollars these projects would raise to reducing emissions. Entrepreneurs have found ways to take captured CO2 and turn it into useful products, such as diamonds, vodka, plastics and carbon fibre. The federal government could assist these budding industries, not through subsidies, which are notoriously ineffective, but by paying companies based on the CO2 they reduce. No one would complain if the government hired a company to remove litter from a city park; the same approach could be used for the atmosphere. The government could tender contracts for CO2 removal, paying firms that were most effective at reducing emissions.But that's a big, bold plan. Let's start by removing Ottawa's free pass for foreign oil.Colin Craig is president of SecondStreet.org, a public policy think-tank. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved."
