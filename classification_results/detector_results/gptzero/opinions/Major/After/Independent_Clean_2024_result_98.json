How do we hold politicians to account if they control the media narrative? Even when they’re not presenting news but acting as interviewers?Zafar JamatiStaffordPutting the cart before the horseThe problem with the Scottish government’snew “hate crime” lawisn’t that it is wrong, but that it isn’t balanced by parallel legal measures to define and defend the right of freedom of expression or provide meaningful protection to those engaging in fair debate. In this regard, the Scottish government has allowed the “cart to go before the horse”, by not first putting in place properly enforceable legal protections.The role of “hate crime” legislation (as with the existing laws on privacy, libel and slander) should be to temper and moderatethe right of free expression, by placing reasonable and sensible legal limits, without stifling fair and open public debate. But it is hard for it to do this when there is no easily enforceable or adequately defined right to freedom of expression in the first place!“Hate Crime” legislation without balancing laws in place on freedom of expression risks exacerbating the harm already done by the UK’s unduly harsh and punitive civil laws on slander and libel, in scaring off the press and public alike from engaging in fair debate and making disclosures on genuine matters of public interest.All this matters because the implications go well beyond the current fracas ongender identityand extend to more general rights of political debate, press freedom and disclosure of wrongdoing (whistleblowing). As such, it is vitally important for our country to get this right (be it the Scottish parliament or Westminster that finally grasps the nettle).Although theHuman Rights Act1998 gave us (UK citizens) plenty of “rights”, it failed to enact any real criminal law provisions to enforce them.The result is that while paying lip service to the right of freedom of expression, it is only really enforceable against government bodies, not private organisations/companies or individuals. (And then only through lengthy civil/private prosecution, whose costs and financial risks lie well beyond the means and appetite of most members of the public.)The loose and largely unenforceable provisions within the Human Rights Act 1998 do little to protect those who dare speak out from unfair consequences, or from misapplication of “hate crime”, slander, libel and privacy legislation.Ultimately, the protection of freedom of expression is not solely a Scottish issue, but one that affects the whole of the UK, and it is shameful that successive Westminster governments since 1998 have skirted around and failed to address this issue (due, one suspects, to the broken system of political patronage at Westminster).The Scottish government’s new legislation has proved a highly charged issue but has also sparked some healthy debate. For my part, it is worth being clear that nothing in any of the above is intended to detract from the guiding principles of tolerance and respect all minority groups in society deserve, nor in any way encourage or protect thosewho peddle hate and intolerance.Mark Campbell-RoddisDunblaneDisconnected establishmentIn his article in Mail Online recently,Boris Johnson objectedto banning arms sales to Israel and evensupported the idea of the Israelisinvading Rafah, thus sanctioning more mass killing of Palestinians.Does this man have any conscience or principles? Is he not aware that atleast 33,000 Palestinianshave already been killed by Israel, at least 14,000 of them children, some deliberatelytargeted by Israeli snipers?The seemingly unwavering support for Israel’s genocidal acts by many in the UK media and political class isevidence of the disconnectbetween the British establishment (represented in this case by a failed, has-been politician) and the British public, with theirinherent sense of justiceand fairness.Riyad TibiMarlowA lost generationThe haunting images fromGazaare of children scarred by conflict, displacement and deprivation.Children have beenwitnessing their past, present and their futures decimated amidst the rubble of Gaza.This is a city that prided itself once on havingthe highest literacy ratesin the Arab world. No words can describe the ongoing plight now.I wonder whether those who continue to inflict such savagery on the people of Gaza still have words to justify their senseless bloodshed. For the sake of humanity, the international community must rescue these children from becoming a truly lost generation.Dr Munjed Farid Al QutobLondon"
