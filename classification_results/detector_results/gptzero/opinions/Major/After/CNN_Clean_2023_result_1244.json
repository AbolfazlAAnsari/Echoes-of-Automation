Elise Stefaniklambasted the university presidentsfor not saying that calls for genocide of Jews was against their codes of conduct andchastised themabout some students' use of the word \"intifada,\" which she defined the word as a \"call to commit genocide against the Jewish people.\"As an Arabic speaker who has written twobookson Palestinian intifadas, I know that it means \"popular uprising,\" and is especially associated withnonviolent grassroots protest.When I was in SJP, I never imagined that powerful entities would care about what we did. But since October 7,Wall Street financiersandCEOshave pressured universities to blacklist student activists.The Anti-Defamation League and Brandeis Center urged administrators toinvestigate SJP chapters, suggesting that students are \"materially supporting\" terrorists. Some schools, among themBrandeis,George Washington UniversityandColumbia,banned or suspendedtheir SJP chapters. Columbia alsosuspendedJewish Voice for Peace, a Jewish anti-Zionist organization in solidarity with Palestinians' freedom struggle.For sure, some individuals and groups over the past two months have expressedcriticism of Israel in ways that are questionableor perhaps even objectionable, leaving some Jewish students feeling unsafe. But there have also been a lot of unfair and inaccurate accusations against pro-Palestinian activism, as last week's hearing illustrated.Meanwhile, there have been alarming reports of nationwideinformation-gathering operationsagainst pro-Palestinian student activists. Some have beendoxedor seen their faces plastered on billboard trucks. Others have seenjob offers rescindedordenied. Some have even receiveddeath threats.For weeks, students criticizing Israel's military actions have spoken about beingafraid to show their faces,express themselves on social media,wear keffiyehsorspeak Arabic in public.Their fears took on alarming resonance after the shooting in Vermont of three Palestinian undergraduates, whichleft one paralyzedand is being investigated as a possible hate crime.University administrators have givenfar too little attentionto dangers faced by students who stand with the Palestinian cause. What they have done is denounce antisemitism.That has been the focus in Washington as well. Both theSenateand theHousehave passed resolutions condemning student activities that they labeled as antisemitic and \"pro-Hamas.\" TheBiden administrationannounced a raft of measures to combat antisemitism at schools and universities. And numeroustop law firmssent a joint letter to law school deans across the country last month, threatening not to hire their students unless deans addressed antisemitism on campus.Why so much attention to universities right now? I would suggest that those who want to preserve US support for Israel view today's college students as a looming threat.Surveys have shownthat young Americans are far more critical of Israelthan are older Americans. Gen Z students, coming of age in an era of mass action on Black Lives Matter, climate change and gun safety, are rallying broad coalitions in support of Palestinian freedom.This generational divide reflects atidal shiftin American politics and the uproar since last week's hearing shows the lengths some are going to shut that down. This must not stand.Shifting the conversation from Israel to antisemitism stymies much needed public debate on US policies, such as a proposal for an additional$14.3 billion in military aidto Israel or last week'sveto of a UN resolutiondemanding a humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza.Backlash against pro-Palestinian voices also undermines the vital role of academic institutions as places where students engage with each other, wrestle with complicated questions and learn how to act on their principles in a fraught world.The role of colleges is to empower students with the knowledge, skills and freedom needed to understand and improve the world. Institutions of higher learning must provide spaces that are safe from violence and intimidation, not from ideas that are challenging or even distressing.Criticism of Israel will leave some feeling uncomfortable; confronting perspectives different from one's own usually does. But that is, after all, what college is all about.Opinion by Wendy PearlmanTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
