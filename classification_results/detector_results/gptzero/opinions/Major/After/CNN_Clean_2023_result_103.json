But projects such as Plain Sight are more desperately needed than ever before. It is clear that the right wing  will continue to ramp up the culture wars, using theirattacks on teaching the history of racerelations to energize the Republican Party's base.Teachers, writers, documentarians and civic organizations arerefusing to be intimidatedand areengaging in the hard workof trying to uncover the ways in which the Black-White fault line has shaped our politics, economy and culture.The project builds on a growing body of scholarship that has looked northward in putting together the history of slavery. Professor Wendy Warren, a colleague of mine at Princeton, was one of the pathbreaking figures in this scholarship, demonstrating in her book \"New England Bound: Slavery and Colonization in Early America\" the strong economic ties between New England farmers and the West Indies, as well as the presence of slavery in the region.Museums have also been part of this conversation. In 2019, the New York Historical Societylaunched an exhibitabout slavery in New York City. They also have a virtual gallery from an earlier exhibit available to the public foronline viewing.In contrast to the South, northern slaves oftenworked within homes or small places of work, alongside their owner rather than on farms. They lived, for example, in tiny rooms within the distinctive saltbox houses that line the main street of Sag Harbor. They helped build the town that became well-known in the 19th century as a whaling port.The project has uncovered a great deal about the journey ofDavid Hempstead Sr., born in 1808, who eventually obtained freedom, growing a family that would help to establish the historic Eastville neighborhood in Sag Harbor, still known for its multi-racial population.When residents or visitors stand at the crossroads of Liberty and Hempstead, they should have a new understanding of the legacy around them. The research has shed light on the history of St. David Church, built by African Americans and Native Americans in 1839 and which provided an important site ofcultural interaction.In 2020, high school student Jon Kuperschmid, who was working with the project, learned through his investigation of an 18th-century estate inventory that an assortment of cheese was valuedmore highly than an enslaved woman. (Phillis was deemed to be worth 8 pounds as opposed to the 15 pounds for \"sundry cheeses\").Before becoming known for its whaling industry, Sag Harbor'seconomy depended on exportingessential materials to sugar-producing islands in the Caribbean -- food, cloth, wood, salt beef and fish and more -- which plantation owners needed to sustain their slave-based economy.Conceived in 2017, the project is the brainchild of Donnamarie Barnes, the curator for Shelter Island's Sylvester Manor, and David Rattray, the editor of the East Hampton Star. Rattray learned that he himself descends from slaveowners; \"It hit me like a ton of bricks,\"he said. He and Barnes recruited high school students to help with the project. They worked with the staff of the Sag Harbor Cinema to secure financial support for the undertakingThe team has been using maps, correspondence, accounting books and tombstones to learn about \"the history we forgot to remember, and remembered to forget,\" according to Barnes. The project, nowbacked by a $200,000 grantsupported by Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, is trying to create a template for local history that can be easily replicated in other parts of the state and country.For many younger residents of places like Sag Harbor, the history is eye-opening, shattering myths they learned in school about an area supposedly disconnected from the evil institution of slavery. \"Now that I know, it's impossible to unsee it,\" noted Julian Alvarez, a local filmmaker who co-created the video about the project.The power of the project comes from its being rooted in the local. As NYU Professor Jennifer L. Morgan explained in an email: \"The Plain Sight initiative... offers people a corrective to the history of where they live. If you are walking down the street in a fancy summer community and confront a brass-brick marker in the sidewalk saying that a Black child worked here, or a Black family lived here, or a Black woman was enslaved here, you are forced to think about the impact of those people on this place. It's powerful to confront the local manifestation of huge historical forces.\"Barnes wrote to me that \"the histories and horrors of enslavement are inescapable, but the stories of the enslaved as individuals, as part of our communities, as our Founders, is one of strength, resilience and survival. These are stories to celebrate.\"The project is the antithesis of theclosed-mindedapproach that Gov. Ron DeSantis is championing in the Sunshine State.\"The fact that40% of householdsin New York City in the colonial era enslaved a Black person is still a shock,\" Morgan wrote me. So is the fact that New York was \"thesecond to last state to abolish slavery in the North, did not do so until 1817, setting the final abolition of slavery in the state to 1827. These basic facts are part of our national history, and the effort to pretend that slavery and Black life had only a tangential impact on our nation is an obscenity,\" Morgan wrote.They refute the notion that it is possible to bury this history and still understand America. Most historians, including those who have beencritical of parts of The New York Times' 1619 Project, appreciate the way in which the profession has vastly strengthened our understanding of American history by incorporating race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality and class into our analytical framework.The new history hasn't hidden the ugliness, struggles and contradictions that have been as integral to our past as the nation's grandest ideals and greatest accomplishments. As a result, teachers and students now start their discussions with a much more accurate and complex base of knowledge.The support for high-quality historical education has survived other moments when education was politicized, such as theJim Crow erawhen learning about race was banned from Southern  classrooms, or the early years of the Cold War when there wasintense pressureagainst writing and teaching that could be smeared as \"socialist\" (which usually meant non-conservative perspectives).The Plain Sight Project is one exciting example of how local communities and educational institutions are figuring out ways to keep moving this important work forward.Opinion by Julian Zelizer, CNN Political AnalystTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
