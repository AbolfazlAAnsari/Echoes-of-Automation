The first, obviously, is to deter Iran andconstrain Iran's tactical optionsas the mullahs mull their retaliation plans.  But the specific choice of these forces is to provide Central Command with capability for sustained, precision strikes against military targets in Iran or among Iran’s militia groups.Don’t forget that U.S. B-2 bombers can reach any spot on the globe.  Also, B-1 bombers were used by Central Command in attacks on Syrian targets. I would not be surprised to see the B-1s in action again with their joint stand-off missiles.Beyond this, expect Britain, France, regional allies like Jordan, and others to have forces in play.Of course, China is taking note of this firepower display.China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yiissued a statement on Saturday supporting Iran’s \"dignity\" and right to self-defense, whatever that means.  Iran is the center of Mideast terror and China is Iran’s top ally.Gen. Erik Kurilla at U.S. Central Command will soon have all he needs to defend, deter or strike back.As they strive to keep a lid on this crisis, we owe a big debt of gratitude to the American men and women making these crisis deployments in the Middle East.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REBECCA GRANTDr. Rebecca Grant is vice president of the Lexington Institute."
