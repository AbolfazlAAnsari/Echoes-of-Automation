These organizations supported the policy change on the grounds that any oil and gas industry advertising that placed fossil fuel production or consumption in a positive light would have grave adverse effects on both human health and the Canadian economy. With one voice they compared advertising that favoured hydrocarbons to cigarette advertising and recommended a similar ban. Other city governments will probably face similar lobbying campaigns.I had only five minutes to speak. I used that brief time to question the premises behind the proposed change. I pointed out that climate change is a global, not local, phenomenon; that Ottawa annually produces only 0.015 per cent of global GHG emissions; that global emissions are mainly driven by economic and population trends in developing countries, which Canada has no influence on; and that blocking ads would in no way affect the climate, temperatures, the weather or their health effects.I also observed that questioning the ethics of oil and gas producers implicitly impugned the actions of consumers who used the industry's products to heat their homes, move people and goods and use the more than 6,000 products that would not exist without hydrocarbon energy and feedstocks - including pharmaceuticals, diagnostic equipment, antiseptics and others important to health.Time did not allow me to comment properly on the comparison of publication bans concerning cigarette smoking and oil and gas consumption.

Climate activists generally regard the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the leading scientific authority on the causes and impacts of climate change. It published its Working Group 1 Sixth Assessment Report(https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/) (AR6) in 2021. That report examined thousands of issues, including the frequency of disasters and \"extreme weather events\" potentially related to climate change, as well as their attribution to natural or human causes. The potential impacts examined included precipitation levels, floods, droughts, erosion of coastlines, frost, heat waves, ocean alkalinity, sea levels, cyclones and hurricanes, to name the most important.
