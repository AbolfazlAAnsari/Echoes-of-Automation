Many researchers believe that Covid-19 may have started in a similar way -spreading from animals to humansby first gaining the ability to spread among mammals that came into contact with humans, and then evolving to transmit directly between humans.The US and other governments around the world need to take H5N1 seriously and demonstrate that we've learned the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic that turned our lives upside-down for years. They should take immediate steps to get out ahead of this risk rather than taking a \"wait and see\" approach.In the short term, governments should act now to deploy the capacities at their disposal to guard against the uncontrolled spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus if it evolves to spread between people. This includes funding research on vaccines that are likely to be effective against the virus, stepping up surveillance of livestock and humans and wider emergency response planning.It has been encouraging to hear that the US Department of Health and Human Services has stepped up surveillance systems and supported testing of potential vaccine candidates that could be more effective against this strain of bird flu than the existing, limited stocks of H5N1 vaccine developed many years ago.Moving forward, it will be critical for human and animal health sectors - including theCDC and the US Department of Agriculture - to work together on bio-surveillance, including by developing a shared approach to monitoring human and animal populations and by exchanging data, to keep tabs on how the virus is evolving.Additionally, if the US government succeeds in identifying an effective vaccine for the new bird flu, it will be important to draw up plans to rapidly produce the vaccine, so that it is ready to go if needed. Further, the US and other governments should think through how to update and act on their existing pandemic flu response plans in case H5N1 begins to spread among humans.To be prepared for a possible outbreak of bird flu, governments around the world need to take these steps now, even in the face of uncertainty. If they wait for a confirmed outbreak among people, it will be extremely difficult to prevent the uncontrolled spread of the virus.It's also time to reassess the long game and make sure that countries around the world have the capacity to detect and respond to future epidemics and pandemics. According to theGlobal Health Security Index, there are significant gaps in countries' pandemic preparedness capabilities.During the Covid pandemic, we witnessed firsthand that capacity matters when it comes to saving lives. According to astudyreleased last year by experts from the Brown University Pandemic Center, the Gates Foundation and NTI, almost all countries that had strong pandemic preparedness capacity at the outset of Covid had lower death rates than less prepared nations.A broad range of capacities have been shown to be effective, including disease detection systems, systems for distributing medical countermeasures and public health infrastructure to deploy non-pharmaceutical interventions.Playing the long game means investing now to make sure that countries have the capacity they need to respond to a worst-case H5N1 pandemic or to be prepared for the next one. Given the impact of Covid, it is deeply disappointing that national governments are not investing the necessary resources to build life-saving pandemic preparedness capacity. This just doesn't make sense.In the United States, federal funding for pandemic influenza is far below what we need to effectively tackle this threat. Government experts have called for$1.15 billion in funding for pandemic influenzafor 2025, but the Biden administration has requested only $335 million. Making matters worse, Congress has made major cuts to pandemic preparedness funding, as part of the ongoing appropriations process.This is also an issue internationally. Most countries - even those with ample resources - have not made financial investments in strengthening pandemic preparedness. The 2021Global Health Security Index- which measures national-level pandemic preparedness capacity and which was collaboratively developed by NTI, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and Economist Impact - found that 155 out of 195 countries have not allocated funds within the last three years to improve capacity (aside from public health emergencies) to address epidemic threats.The White House justannounceda new Global Health Security Strategy, which includes a commitment to work with 50 countries to build pandemic preparedness capacity. This is a great step in the right direction, but the US government and their partners will need to make sure they have the financial resources and political will to follow through on this pledge.Playing the long game also means supporting theWorld Bank Pandemic Fund,which is designed to invest in long-term pandemic preparedness capacity of low- and middle-income countries. The fund received $1.9 billion dollars in pledged resources from national governments, philanthropic organizations and other groups, but it is making grants to support valuable capacity building efforts and will soon run out of funds. Experts estimate that it will take approximately $10 billion per year for at least five years to provide the funding that will allow countries to build infectious disease detection and response capacity that will be needed to guard against pandemics. We must do better.Covid made pandemic risks clear, and unfortunately in many parts of the world, we witnessed the deadly consequences. Governments need to act quickly and decisively now, to get ahead of the growing H5N1 flu public health threat, while also investing in long-term capacity building to make sure the world is better prepared for the next pandemic.Opinion by Jaime M.
