But of course I have, or at least some who desperately wished they could acknowledge their true selves but didn’t dare to.I still struggle with understanding, but Mr. Henig’s riveting piece helped me grasp how difficult or impossible it is to live as the wrong gender, the enormous work it takes to transition and most of all the courage to do it.Things have changed in so many ways since 1950, many for the good. Thank you, Mr. Henig, for illuminating one of them.George HagerWashingtonWriting and ThinkingTo the Editor:Re “Fourth Grader or Chatbot?” (The Upshot, Jan. 4):To learn to write is to learn to think.During my 15 years in a high school English department, one of our standard assignments was: “Choose a passage from tonight’s reading assignment that is interesting, significant and meaningful, and in one page of writing, explain why it is interesting, significant and meaningful.”The beauty of this is that it gives teenagers great freedom, while putting the burden on them to develop insights, recognize meanings, make connections. Putting these into the best words is vital — but only a close second to having the best thoughts.My teenagers were simultaneously joyous and freaked out by this assignment; nobody was telling them what to write about!Wails I would hear (and it was always music to my ears to hear my teenagers say what they were feeling) in connection with, say, “Macbeth” or “1984” might be, “Mr. V., I never know what to write about!” or “Mr. V., nothing in this book is interesting!” or “Mr. V., whaddaya mean by ‘meaningful’?”No chatbot will ever help kids with this most necessary and enduring of writing tasks: to have an idea entirely on one’s own and to make it clear to others.Marc VincentiPalo Alto, Calif.This article appeared in print on page A21."
