New York State leaves unused its regulatory authority to require the inclusion of midwives on hospital staff and to eliminate unnecessary barriers to establishing midwifery-led birth centers.Gov. Kathy Hochulsigned a law in January 2022that was intended to support expansion of midwifery. Butproposed regulations, for which public comments end on July 31, make clear that New York continues to place obstacles to integration of midwives into pregnancy and birthing care.Safe, joyous pregnancy and birth require midwifery and other improvements that Dr. Gillispie-Bell describes, not more bureaucratic barriers. We hope that New York will modify its regulations and be on the right side of this still tragic story.Mary T. BassettRichard N. GottfriedDeborah L.

An increasingly assertive and confrontational China was the result, as seen in its more openly aggressive style abroad, and repressive tactics at home.What the new crop of leaders apparently failed to recognize is that China’s dramatic growth over the past 30 years was because of its integration with the West, and the Western-led liberal economic order, not despite it.In 1992, the reformist leader Deng Xiaoping cautioned his countrymen to remain poised during a period of explosive growth, urging China to “hide its strength, bide its time and never take the lead.”The United States and the West should certainly welcome China’s newfound realization that it is not on a linear path to global supremacy. And they should work to reinvigorate multilateral engagement. But they should also be cleareyed that Deng’s words have been lost on a new generation of Chinese leadership, and move forward with due and proper caution.Stuart GottliebNew YorkThe writer, a former Senate foreign policy adviser and speechwriter, teaches American foreign policy and international security at Columbia University.‘Underpaid and Undervalued’ TeachersTo the Editor:The headline of Paul Krugman’s July 11 column, “No, ‘Socialism’ Isn’t Making Americans Lazy,” could have been followed by the subtitle “But Neoliberalism Is Making Them Sick and Tired.”In the field of education, where we are experiencing a serious shortage of highly qualified teachers, especially in the most disadvantaged schools, teachers are leaving the profession not because they are lazy and/or don’t want to work, but because they are sick and tired of being underpaid and undervalued.Beyond education, the broad attack on unions over the past 50 years, which has helped create workers’ discontent across the work force, adds to the misperception of the lazy worker. Workers who are grossly undercompensated and undervalued, like the majority of teachers in our schools, will not work with the same enthusiasm as those who earn a living wage, have the power to collectively bargain and have full benefits.Yes, Americans are hard workers, as Mr. Krugman illustrates, and will work for food, shelter, health care and the well-being of their family in spite of lousy working conditions. But many of them have little reason to be happy about the work they are being inadequately paid to do.Eric J. WeinerNew YorkThe writer is a professor of education at Montclair State University.Admissions at HarvardTo the Editor:Although I am retired and currently have nothing to do with the Harvard Admissions Office, I worked in that office for 50 years. I learned that three-quarters or more of the applicants to a typical class are qualified to do the work — and many would graduate with honors. The children of alumni present credentials better than the average overall qualified applicants.During that half century, I occasionally had to advise new staff members who, like some of today’s critics, misinterpreted the extent of Harvard’s consideration of alumni children.Two or three times when a new staff member was presenting the application of an alum child who had sterling standardized test scores, but had wholly underperformed in the classroom or was poorly recommended by their school, I occasionally shared some of my Southern Black folk wisdom:Being the child of an alum can “heal the sick, but it can’t raise the dead!”That wisdom still holds and applies especially to applicants who have seemingly not worked up to their own potential.David L. EvansCambridge, Mass.End the Senate ‘Hold’To the Editor:Re “Blinken Says Senate Delay on Nominees Risks Security” (news article, July 18):It is high time that the Senate eliminate the “hold” privilege, which allows one senator to block nominees and military promotions. It is a harmful relic, like the filibuster, and thwarts the will of the majority.No wonder people think that democracy is inefficient. This practice is anti-democratic at its core.Seth M.
