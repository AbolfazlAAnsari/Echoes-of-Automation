As The Atlantic's Ron Brownsteinhas written, the president's focus on blue-collar work harkens back to an older tradition among Democrats and \"separates Biden from the past two Democratic presidents, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.\"At the same time, Biden has prioritized some Clinton-esque quality of life issues that could appeal to political agnostics, such as strong-arming airlines into letting familiessit togetherand encouraging Congress totake actionto protect kids' privacy online.It's a mix of big-picture rhetorical shifts and smaller, tangible initiatives - a close cousin to Clinton's successful triangulation in the mid-1990s. And it should make Republicans think a little harder about how they might campaign against a second Biden term in next year's general election.Republicans will likely turn to some familiar tools in the playbook. Congressional Republicanswill hold hearingsinto Hunter Biden's financial dealings and anything else that has the whiff of scandal. They will continue to make hay with any steps that suggest the administration is beholden to activists outside of the ideological mainstream,like replacing\"mothers\" with \"birthing person\" in federal documents. And they will continueto slowly ratchet upthe rhetoric around Ukraine, trying to find fault with the Biden administration's handling of the war as it grinds into its second year.But the tried-and-true messaging that excites the base will not be sufficient to combat Biden's political pivot to the center. And on the campaign trail, former President Donald Trump is promising to be \"retribution\" against the \"Deep State,\" overshadowing his more creative andlaudable policieslike new cities and baby bonuses.To muster an effective response, Republicans need not and should not be afraid to counter with their own proactive agenda. If Biden is going to propose popular, even populist, economic policies like infrastructure spending andcurbing \"junk fees,\"the GOP should prioritize politically-salient issues of their own.A strong federal effort to give familiesmore toolsto keep their kids safe online would resonate with a majority of parents across the political aisle. Committing to extending or improving theChild Tax Creditwould give parents peace of mind and a positive reason to vote for Republicans.In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantishas proposedeliminating sales taxes on baby supplies, diapers, wipes and strollers, and states with Republican legislatures, likeTexasandGeorgia, are contemplating similar bills. Those are the type of visible, tangible policies that can connect with voters' values and their pocketbooks. Trump's futuristic agenda, if it could be plausibly spelled out in detail, offers another forward-looking approach.Republicans in the mid-1990s thought Clinton was up against the ropes, only to see him recover and win convincingly. Those who expect Biden to fade quietly may be similarly disappointed.Pointing out the flaws in the White House's agenda and priorities is the basic blocking and tackling of politics. To truly make a play for independent and moderate voters, the GOP will need to develop a policy agenda that similarly goes on the offensive.Opinion by Patrick T.
