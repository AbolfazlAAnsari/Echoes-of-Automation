It's Me, Margaret,\" a film adaptation of Judy Blume's beloved 1970 novel, is getting rave reviews, with a near-perfect score onRotten Tomatoes. The classic young adult book has been translated by director Kelly Fremon Craig into an oh-so-slightly modernized movie, still set in 1970, chronicling a year in the life of pre-teen Margaret. It's a big year, too: Margaret's parents move the family from Manhattan to suburban New Jersey; she's growing anxious about the onset of puberty and whether she's developing quickly enough to be \"normal\"; and she's grappling with big questions about religion, as her nonreligious parents have told her she can choose her own faith when she's old enough.The movie's arrival makes for a darkly absurdist cultural moment.

But I think there's a bigger reason why the GOP might consider \"Margaret\" a dangerous movie: It takes a wholly realistic view of toxic people and how to deal with them. Blume has an unmatched ability to dive into the messy complexity of human relationships in her young adult books. In \"Margaret,\" one of the most interesting plotlines is the title character's social circle, starting with her domineering neighbor Nancy Wheeler (played with great aplomb by Elle Graham). She's bossy, she's insensitive, she's capable of being cruel to easy targets... and she's a lot of fun.Blume rendered this portrayal of frenemy-hood long before that was a word; it may still be set 50 years ago, but it feels as fresh as ever. (A parallel storyline, which I believe has been added to the film, follows her mom's more cautious relationship to Nancy's alpha-mom character.) Then, of course, there are Margaret's antisemitic grandparents, who show up hoping she'll come into the Christian fold and - spoiler alert - are sent packing. If kids come away from the movie, or book, better prepared to navigate relationships with a-holes, maybe they'll also be better prepared to push back against the bigots trying to take away their rights and their education.There's even a plot point in \"Margaret\" that functions as a direct response - albeit a coincidental one - to the latest piece of backwards GOP legislation. In the film, Margaret's much-anticipated trip to Florida to see her grandmother (Kathy Bates) has to be scrapped. And that's just as well, because in our present-day reality, Florida Republicans think students in fifth grade or younger shouldn't be educated about, or allowed to talk openly about, their period or anyone else's. In March, Florida Rep. Stan McClain introduced legislation that wouldbanany discussion of menstruation in schools before middle school (which starts at a later age than many girls get their first periods).The bill, currently in the Florida Senate, is cruel, offensive, misogynist and completely of a piece with the GOP's relentlesscampaign of censorship.Thankfully, one of Blume's greatest strengths is never, ever talking down to her young readers. She takes them and their problems very seriously, even when writing the comedic parts. And it is condescending in the extreme to tell today's embattled kids they aren't allowed to read books that make them feel understood.For better and worse, the GOP isn't trying to ban movies - yet. So I truly hope this one makes a killing at the box office, and that every single kid who wants to see it gets to. For one of the most lovely, gentle, good-hearted movies I've seen in years, \"Margaret\" makes for a hell of a battle cry.Opinion by Sara StewartTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
