Where is therecession? Each passing month, the consensus looks increasingly off-base. Yes, the economy will ultimately slump, but odds are fading that a recession is dead ahead.Who decides if we are in a recession? The accepted arbiter is theBusiness Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research. This group of highly respected apolitical academics define a recession as a broad-based and persistent decline in economic activity. That is, there are significant declines in activity across many industries for more than just a few months.The pessimists have history on their side. When the economy struggles with high inflation and the Federal Reserve quickly increases interest rates to quell it,recessionalmost always follows. Some key markers that economists monitor for recession risks - such as theConference Board's index of leading economic indicatorsand aninverted yield curve- are also signaling a downturn.For several reasons - more or less unique to this time - we haven't suffered a recession, and the odds are that we won't. Here are my top five reasons:First,excess savings. Consumers could not spend as usual during the pandemic. They were stuck at home, forced toshelter-in-placeand they saved a lot of money by doing so. Consumers have been using those savings since then to supplement the purchasing power that was eroded by high inflation. They have not beenspendingwith abandon, but just enough to keep the economy moving forward. Consumers are the firewall between recession and a growing economy, and the firewall is holding firm.Second, labor hoarding.Businessesdesperately want toavoid layoffs. Even before the pandemic, they struggled tohireand retain talent. The pandemic made this substantially more problematic when workers could not work for fear of getting sick or finding child care. Now on the other side of the pandemic, businesses understand that labor shortages will be a persistent problem as theBaby Boomer generation retiresin the coming decade.Businesses also have come to rely increasingly onforeign immigrantsto fill jobs at all skill levels - a practice that has gotten tougher because our immigration system remains broken in more ways than one.Third, light debt loads. Households and businesses haveborrowedprudently since the global financial crisis over a decade ago. Households now shell out less of their income oninterest and principal payments on their debtsthan at any time recorded in history, except at the height of Covid-19, when pandemic relief included a moratorium on some mortgage and student loan payments.Businessesare also devoting a near record low amount of their profits to debt payments, freeing up cash to finance hiring and investment.It is especially encouraging that households and businesses also did a marvelous job locking in the previously record low interest rates and arelargely insulated from the currently higher rates. Some lower-income households have overdone it, taking on too much credit card credit and personal loan debt, and some businesses acquired byprivate equity firmshave taken on lots of debt. But these are exceptions.Fourth, anchoredinflation expectations. The key threat to optimism for avoiding a recession is that inflation may remain too high for the Fed's comfort, leading the central bank to raise rates until the economy breaks. The Fed has a tough job. It must raise rates high enough and fast enough to slow growth and quell inflation, but not so high and so fast that it undermines the economy.But the Fed's success so far in pinning down inflation expectations makes its job easier. If consumers and businesses believe the Fed will do what is needed to ensure inflation recedes, then they will behave accordingly. And that makes it more likely to come true.Fifth, lowoil prices. There have been a dozenrecessionssince World War II, almost all preceded by aspikeinoil prices. We are less dependent on oil than we have ever been, due to the fracking revolution and the move to green energy, but we are still dependent. And when Russia invaded Ukraine early last year and oil prices jumped, it did not augur well for our economy. Russia accounts for about one-tenth of the world'soil supply, andUSandEuropeansanctions on Russian oil suggested oil prices would remain high.But that is not what has happened. Globaloil markets have gracefully adjustedto pre-war levels.Oil pricesare down, and so too is inflation, both in theUSandglobally.Given history, there's no shame in the consensus that we would follow a familiar recession pattern now. However, this time is different. Yes, the economy is fragile and vulnerable to losing the script. And goodness knows we have been off script more often than not in recent years. But odds are that we will buck history and avoid recession.Opinion by Mark ZandiTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
