            "inputText": "By Daniel AbleserThe Rand Formula or \"mandatory check-off\" is a straightforward concept in labour law: employees in a unionized workforce must pay union dues. It was born of an arbitration decision by Supreme Court Justice Ivan Rand that ended a 1945 strike against Ford in Windsor, Ontario. Before Rand, unions could only collect dues from members on a voluntary basis and the employer did not assist in the collection. The UAW sought to make union membership mandatory and have Ford collect and remit dues to the union. Ford sought to keep union membership voluntary so as to limit the union's power. Rand ultimately ruled that while membership would be technically voluntary, employees had to pay dues whether or not they chose to formally join the union.The Rand Formula has been adopted in unionized environments across Canada and also enshrined in labour laws that the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled constitutional. Laws and collective agreements may notionally allow union members to conscientiously object on religious grounds and apply to the labour board for an exemption under which they pay an amount equal to the dues to an agreed-upon charity. However, that option is rarely used. Employees generally treat union dues as no different than income tax, EI and CPP source deductions.The concept that employees who receive benefits from collective bargaining cannot freeload is therefore well-founded. On the other hand, forcing union members to fund political activity they do not support is wrong.Following Hamas's attack on Israel, CUPE Local 3906, which represents 3,000 McMaster University academic staff, posted on X (formerly Twitter) \"Palestine is rising, long live the resistance\" and shared a post glorifying the attack. CUPE Ontario President Fred Hahn \"liked\" the CUPE 3906 post and shared his own support for the attacks on Israel, including a post that stated \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" - a well-known chant that in effect calls for Israel to be eliminated: from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.It might be argued that Hahn's actions were personal and not in his capacity as CUPE president.
