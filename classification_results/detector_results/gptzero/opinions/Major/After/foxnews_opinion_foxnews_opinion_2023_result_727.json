He has done neither.BIDEN HAS ANOTHER CALAMITOUS YEAR AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER IN 2023 AS RECORDS SHATTERIt should be obvious that Biden’s sudden interest in the border is a political stunt to look like action is being taken, get good press and write campaign ads about how tough he is onillegal immigration.In an aerial view, thousands of illegal immigrants, most wearing thermal blankets, await processing at a U.S. Border Patrol transit center in Eagle Pass, Texas, on Dec. 19. Major surges of migrants illegally crossing the Rio Grande have overwhelmed U.S. border authorities in recent weeks.(John Moore/Getty Images)Now Biden is adding insult to injury. Media reports indicate that the border is in such chaos that the Biden administration is using resources from the VA to facilitatehealthcare for illegal aliens.This is a slap in the face to our veterans and to the taxpayer.That’s why, last week, I introduced the No VA Resources for Illegal Aliens Act in the Senate. My bill does just what it says. It prohibits VA resources, whether healthcare or claims processing for healthcare, from being used for illegal aliens. The bill already has the support of the Chairman of the House VA Committee Mike Bost, and I’m hopeful that Congress can pass it soon.Biden flacks argue that since the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reimburses the VA for these services, there is no issue. But this is wrong. In reality, DHS is leveraging healthcare providers in the VA’s Community Care Network, which was established to ensure veterans could access doctors in their own town, for the care of illegal aliens.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONAs a result, veterans are forced to travel to VA facilities instead of relying on doctors in their communities. That means the administration is prioritizing the needs of illegal immigrants over the needs of our nation’s veterans. It’s hard to think of something more un-American than that.There was a similar scandal at the VA the last time Biden was in the White House. In President Barack Obama’s second term, dozens of veterans died while waiting for care. The VA then lied about it to cover it up. Some of those folks are being hired back by the Biden administration. VA leadership in the Obama years didn’t fire the offenders because of job protections for federal employees.It’s no wonder we have such a massive crisis at the border. People around the world know that they can simply waltz into our country, go to a blue state, and get free healthcare, free education, drivers’ licenses and even cash benefits. Meanwhile, the people of this country work hard, pay taxes and face rising prices for just about everything. Securing our border will require shutting off the magnet that is drawing illegals into this country.Our veterans earned their healthcare serving in uniform for the United States. Illegals haven’t earned a dime from the taxpayer — they shouldn’t even be in the country. The contrast couldn’t be clearer.There’s no reason this legislation should not become law. Following the law — whether at the VA or at the border — shouldn’t be a partisan issue, and neither should caring for our veterans. If Biden is serious about securing the border, he should urge Democrats to pass this common-sense legislation and sign it into law.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.
