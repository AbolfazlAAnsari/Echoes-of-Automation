Grant citizenship to every immigrant who works and pays taxes for seven consecutive years and avoids criminal activity. The American ideal of immigration entails responsible contribution to society; this approach would be a direct measure and reward for social responsibility. It would give immigrants a very clear goal to pursue, and would dramatically reduce the bureaucracy involved in the naturalization process.Immigrants have always been essential to American greatness. We should establish these principles to enshrine immigration in our social contract, extending our welcome, and clarifying our expectations of all newcomers.Ron MeyersNew YorkTo the Editor:I agree with Michael Bloomberg’s essay. Why can’t the feds house the immigrants seeking asylum in military bases with adequate supervision and food? We have unused military bases all over the country.James LeighSan FranciscoThe Purpose of CollegeTo the Editor:How refreshing to read Jonathan Malesic’s Sept. 5 Opinion guest essay, “College Is Not a Job. That’s the Whole Point”!Nearly 45 years after university graduation, I consider myself fortunate to have attended when I did: a time when learning was, perhaps, more valued for its own sake, rather than for the post-graduation job it might secure; a time when a liberal arts degree was valued for its inherent intellectual worth, rather than derided as the frivolous choice of a hard-to-define elite; a time when diverse points of view were valued — even if challenged and debated — rather than dismissed out of hand as the oppressor’s malevolent propaganda.As Mr. Malesic so aptly notes in arguing that college’s prime purpose should be leisure, not getting a job, “Life is much more than work.” Perhaps it is only when one is further along life’s path that this truth more easily is revealed. Life’s options — academic, professional, leisure — are there to be explored and savored, and what better time than when young, free of constricting obligations that may make it more difficult later.Mr. Malesic’s essay offers hope that someday we again will come to value a college education for its transformational impact, its ability to foster the curiosity, enthusiasm and drive that may, in fact, help change our world for the better.Marcie S. GitlinNew YorkRepublican HypocrisyTo the Editor:Re “Trump Is Nothing Without Accomplices,” by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt (Opinion guest essay, Sept. 10):The question that really needs to be asked of the Republican primary candidates is this: If Hunter Biden is convicted of whatever crimes he ends up being charged with, should that preclude Joe Biden from running for president as the Democratic candidate? Would you demand that Joe Biden step down from his candidacy?That will tell you all you need to know about the hypocrisy of most of the Republican candidates.Leslie RossCrystal Lake, Ill.This article appeared in print on page A23."
