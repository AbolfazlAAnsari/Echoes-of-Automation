Every college football decision has been made with solely short-term interests-rather than what's good for the sport, and higher education in general-in mind. No one's minding the store. So everyone's pulling up and selling anything not nailed down.This is bad enough for college football which is going to look up in 10 years and realize almosteverything people loved about it is now gone. But it's also bigger than college football. If you care about other collegiate sports, or just \"college\" as a concept-you need to know: there is collateral damage everywhere.First off, what may make sense for college football television contracts-the reason all this realignment is happening in the first place-is generally a disaster for every other collegiate non-revenue sport. (A non-revenue sport is one that doesn't make money for the university but is an essential part of the collegiate experience regardless-generally speaking, it's every sport but football and occasionally men's college basketball).It might not be a huge deal for Illinois football players to fly all the way out to Los Angeles for their one game a week, but it sure is for volleyball players or women's soccer players or the swimming team. The travel budgets for non-revenue sportsare already meager; expecting those teams to be able to afford constant cross-country mid-week trips is an unreasonable ask.That's not even accounting for how much in-class time these students-almost none of whom are training for any sort of career in professional athletics and are, in fact, in school to get a degree-miss with all this constant travel. (Softball players from Oregon and Arizona State, two of the schools leaving the Pac-12,have been consistently pointing this out.)College football has long helped fund these smaller sports, but now it has grown into a behemoth that threatens to eat them entirely.But there is an existential question here as well: At a certain level, if the primary driver of major university decisions-the other schools they align themselves with, the way they fund their operations, their primary public outreach that sports provide-is going to be college football (as it increasingly is becoming), well, that's not what this was supposed to be about, was it?You'd have to ask University of Arizona president Robert Robbins-whose decision to move to the Big 12 was the final dagger in the Pac-12's heart-if he imagined his career in higher education would lead to himdismissinga potential $23 million-per-school-per-year deal with Apple TV (which required fans specifically subscribe to the service to watch Pac-12 games rather than have them delivered via traditional cable channels) as \"selling candy bars for Little League or Girl Scout cookies.\" I doubt if that's what he got him inspired him to join the world of educating young minds in the first place.The changing nature of higher education-the pressures, internal and external, that have affected the industry over the last decade-has put presidents such Robbins in the same late-stage-capitalism, get-what-you-can-while-you-can bind as so many other administrators. Many see this as their only salvation. Which has led to the money involved in college football ultimately eating institutions from the inside out.Is there a solution here? One may have come, from all places, controversial basketball coaching legend Rick Pitino,who posted onX (formerly Twitter): \"Doesn't it make more sense for football to break away to separate leagues and allow the rest of the sports to compete regionally?\"Pitino is hardly the arbiter of what makes sense in life, to say the least, but he's right about this. College football has become so outsized-and so independent, at this point, from any other part of the college experience entirely-that connecting it to the university like it's just like every other student program is looking increasingly outdated.As Pitino suggests, perhaps college football just does its own thing, with its own rules (since the NCAA is not in charge of it anymore), and the rest of college sports, and university life, goes on like it always has. Oregon can play Rutgers all they want in football, but in basketball, the Ducks can stay in the Pac-12 and play schools that don't take a week to travel back and forth to visit.Universities in power conferences can treat college football almost like an endowment, a way to fund activities when you need it but not as something tied to the institution in the same way as basketball, or debate club, or the philosophy. Right now, college football is driving the car for universities, and it's in danger of recklessly sending it careening over a ravine. Perhaps it is time to let it go its own way-and let the rest of the schools do the same.Opinion by Will LeitchTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
