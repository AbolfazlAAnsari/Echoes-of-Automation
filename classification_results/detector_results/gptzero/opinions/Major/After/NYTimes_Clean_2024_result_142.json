Others may never get there, leaving loved ones to wonder how their “choose your own adventure” could have followed a different chapter. No journey is ever truly complete.Infertility may be behind me, but its wake — a stillborn son, a ruptured uterus, a C-section scar, new family members in our surrogates who carried our daughters — will reverberate for my lifetime.Many individuals will face infertility for the first time today, tomorrow or someday in the future. I always make time for those who reach out to me, hoping my experience can help them — or, at the very least, give them a chance to talk to someone on the metaphorical “other side.”Journeys can break us or make us into someone new. Whatever euphemism we use, the important thing is don’t make it your ending when you get to the other side. Make it a new beginning to help those who follow in your footsteps.Lia Buffa De FeoNew YorkTo the Editor:With respect to cancer, its patients and their families — and all those dismayed by what linguists call “semantic drift” — let’s agree to call cancer a “situation.” Not a sentimental, self-help journey. Not a grim or rousing battle. Definitely something fraught and serious: a situation that compels utmost attention and action over time, time that makes no promises.Karin Halvorson HillhouseWashingtonProviding Help for the Homeless and the Mentally IllTo the Editor:Re “Citing Safety, New York Moves Mentally Ill People From the Subway” (news article, May 11):As New Yorkers daily enter our transit system, the sight of men and women sleeping on station benches or in subway cars causes mixed emotions ranging from dismay to fear to disgust. The mantra from the riders, either mumbled or spoken aloud, usually goes: “Why can’t the mayor clean this up?”And it’s a mantra that has, for decades now, moved mayors, under the guise of compassion, to take aggressive action to remove from the subways those who are poor, more often than not homeless, and desperately struggling with mental health issues.Of course, the cynics in us understand the politics of the moment and the need for mayors to show strength and resolve, even if their actions provide only a short-term fix.Yes, these are difficult and seemingly intractable problems. But we’re never going to find lasting solutions unless we begin to understand and address the root issues.As a start, we need to understand how these folks were allowed to fall deeper and deeper into the cracks. How community-based health and mental health systems — often nonexistent or, at best, bare-bones in poor communities — were unable to provide any real, meaningful support before they became so lost to us.Most immediately, though, the city should engage with high-quality mental health teams to inundate the subway system, offering more than just a stay in a dilapidated shelter or an involuntary commitment to a psychiatric facility. And it should study the work of other cities, which have used programs such asHousing Firstto help address the mental health issues of those living on the streets by providing permanent housing.Arnold S.
