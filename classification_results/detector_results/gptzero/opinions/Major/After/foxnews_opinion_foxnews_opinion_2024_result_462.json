HERE'S WHY THEY'RE DEAD WRONGThis report arrives at a critical juncture inAmerican discourse on crime, coinciding with a heightened sense of unease felt across the nation. Recent findings from Gallup underscore a seismic shift in public sentiment: for the first time in two decades, a majority of Americans believe that the United States is \"not tough enough\" on crime.This sentiment marks a significant departure from previous years, with 58% of respondents indicating a belief that the criminal-legal system is too lenient, a notable increase from the 41% recorded in 2020.Such sentiments reflect a growing concern among American citizens regarding public safety and the efficacy of law enforcement measures. Against the backdrop of escalating crime rates in urban centers across the nation, the imperative for proactive intervention becomes all the more urgent. The need for robust policies and decisive action to address these challenges is critical.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONAt its core, this issue ofcrime transcends partisan dividesand ideological differences, or at least it should. Every American deserves to feel safe within their communities, shielded from the threat of violence and lawlessness that only serves to undermine the fabric of society.As the nation braces itself for what could be one of the most pivotal elections in its history, the issue of crime should be on the minds of many Americans. In just a few short months, voters will cast their ballots, not just for candidates, but for the very direction of their communities and the nation as a whole.This election is about more than just partisan politics; it's about the fundamental right of every citizen to feel secure in their homes and neighborhoods.In the five cities highlighted in recent reports, the disparity in approaches to tackling crime is glaring. This election will serve as a referendum on which party is truly committed to ensuring the safety and security of all Americans, regardless of where they live or their socioeconomic status. The outcome could shape the trajectory of crime prevention and law enforcement policies for years, even decades, to come, making it one of the most consequential elections in recent memory.In the United States,one party takes crime far more seriouslythan the other. With November fast approaching, all Americans would do well to remember this undeniable fact. JOHN MAC GHLIONNJohn Mac Ghlionn is a researcher and essayist. He covers psychology and social relations.
