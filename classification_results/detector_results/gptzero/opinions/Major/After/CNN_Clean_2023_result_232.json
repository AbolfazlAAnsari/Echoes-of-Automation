Aproposal for a Trans-Atlantic Anti-Corruption Council lays out the perfect  framework for such a body. It would bring together officials and experts to further align anti-corruption policy on both sides of the Atlantic, and is precisely what's needed if America, Britain, the European Union and Canada are to present a unified front on the sanctions regime.We know that the threat of being sanctionedstill strikes fearin the heart of Russian officials and oligarchs. It's possible that they recalled a similar case from over a decade ago, after the imprisonment and death in custody of Russian figure Sergei Magnitsky. That led US lawmakers to pass the well-known and broadly successful 2012 \"Magnitsky Act\" sanctions program which Russians came to revile.The law was signed by then-President Barack Obama as a retaliation against the human rights abuses suffered by Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer and auditor who discovered hundreds of millions of dollars in graft and fraud involving the Kremlin. Magnitsky, who was arrested without charge after blowing the whistle, ultimately died during his detention under suspicious circumstances.A 2016 measure, theGlobal Magnitsky Act, expanded on the original law, and has succeeded in targetinghundredsof corrupt individuals and entities around the world since its enactment, according to the US government. A number ofEuropean countrieshave also passed their own versions of the Magnitsky Act.Somehow it seems - despite all the attention Moscow has drawn over the past year for its invasion of Ukraine and the increasingly authoritarian leadership of President Vladimir Putin - that the West still treads gingerly with the Russian dictator, even amid his egregious human rights abuses and blatant violations of international law.The US senators have gestured at least toward trying to help Kara-Murza, a man who had survived two poisonings suspected to have been carried out by the Russian regime, and who as a result haslost feeling in both feet and one of his arms.The letter by US lawmakers is a small step, but it is at very least, a start. Washington should now follow it up with more robust action, including declaring Kara-Murza \"wrongfully detained.\"The US government should encourage Western allies to take similar stringent measures against Putin's regime and to pledge to improve coordination on sanctions moving forward. It might yield results in the form of fewer detained dissidents - and could even lead to the long-overdue freedom from prison for Kara-Murza.Opinion by Casey MichelTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
