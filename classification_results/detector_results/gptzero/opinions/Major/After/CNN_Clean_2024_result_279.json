And in the short run, it worked great. In 2012, 19% of operating cash flow was being returned toshareholdersin the form of dividends and buybacks. By 2015, this had ramped up to an astonishing 99%. It stayed in the 90% range until the two MAX crashes and the resulting MAX line shutdown. Between 2014 and 2018, the company rewarded investors with $53 billion in these returns. Senior executives, often compensated on the basis ofstock returns, also did quite well.The result of this strategy is plain to see: an under-resourced supply chain, and an equally under-resourced and badly alienated workforce. These have resulted inmissed production targets, seriousprogram delays,failed safety auditsand embarrassing instances ofshoddy workmanship. Regulatory and political scrutiny is increasing and will likely worsen.Boeing's brand is increasingly tarnished. Airlines are increasinglyvocal with their anger and frustration, as their fleet plans - and associated revenue forecasts - have been confounded by delivery delays. Technical issues, coupled with increased regulatory oversight, have jeopardized certification timing for two new variants of the 737 MAX, the737 MAX 7and 737MAX 10. Airlines likeSouthwestand United had pegged their fleet plans to these models, so the delays are sure to impact the number of flights they're able to schedule. And even Boeing'sstock pricehas begun to suffer - ironic for a management team accused of an excessive financial focus.All is not lost. Boeing still has good people, impressive technologies and great jetliners. The latter are in a duopoly with very high entry barriers, even if Airbus is quickly gaining market share. All that's needed is a new approach to management at the top.If there is a new management team, it would be wise for them to learn from history. Treating suppliers and workers as partners would be a great start. Senior executives need to engage directly with them, spending time in factories, talking with the suppliers, engineers and machinists engaged in the company's core business. Instead of denying the need for any new products - asCalhoun bizarrely did in November 2022when he said the company might not introduce any new models until the 2030s - they should be talking about new opportunities that would restore the company to industry leadership.A lot of this comes down to just showing up. The current approach of staying in office buildings and focusing on financial abstractions clearly isn't working.Opinion by Richard AboulafiaTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
