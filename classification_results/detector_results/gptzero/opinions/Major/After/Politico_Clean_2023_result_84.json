A pardon itself would be a flash point, as the Ford pardon of Nixon was, but it would at least take the unprecedented possibility of a former president behind bars off the table.There is some significant plurality of the country that simply isn't going to accept the legitimacy of the charges. Maybe this shouldn't matter - the law is the law. If the shoe were on the other foot, though, and if it were the Ron DeSantis Department of Justice prosecuting a Democrat with a significant chance of running against him, there'd be an outcry from the same people now dismissing any doubts about the Trump prosecution.Those doubts are based on more than the typical partisan suspicions of the other side. The Trump prosecution comes against the backdrop of the years-long Russia investigation by the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller that cast a pall over Trump's campaign and early presidency and that was based on gossamer thin, politically motivated information.It comes after Hillary Clinton got a prosecutorial pass over her \"home brew\" email set-up as secretary of State that was designed to evade government record-keeping rules and that transmitted and stored classified information and sensitive discussions, putting their security at risk.It comes as the Hunter Biden investigation has dragged on since 2018, with an IRS whistleblower now alleging a cover-up.It comes at the same time as the Department of Justice has failed to appoint a special counsel to probe whether the Biden family has used its influence to enrich itself.What we should want to avoid is a pattern of legal retribution and counter-retribution. That would distort our legal process beyond anything that's happened to this point, further subordinating it to politics and undermining public trust in it. Perhaps this prosecutorial tribal warfare has already been unleashed, but a Trump pardon has a chance of sapping some of the poison out of the system.It's also worth emphasizing that in any of these pardon scenarios, Trump has lost his latest bid for the presidency, either in the primary or the general election. This means he'd presumably be a much-reduced figure, whether he'd been rejected by Republican primary voters or lost a national election a second time (although I thought the same thing after the 2020 election). We aren't talking about a pardon clearing the way for another White House bid, but rather as a consolation prize for someone who is vastly diminished and looking at potentially losing his freedom, too.There are reasonable objections to all this. Pardoning Trump would mean entrenching a norm that high-flying political figures don't have to play by the same rules around the handling of classified documents that everyone else does. Also, usually someone asks for a pardon, and expresses remorse for their wrongdoing. It's impossible to imagine Trump doing that. Finally, we don't know what 2024 will look like, and it may be that by the end of it, Trump looks more unsympathetic to a Republican president and more loathsome to Joe Biden.At the end of the day, a Trump pardon would be about book-ending the Trump era, trying to get beyond a noxious chapter that both he and his often unscrupulous, overzealous pursuers contributed to. If Trump is a Nixon, it'd be best for the country if he found his Gerald Ford."
