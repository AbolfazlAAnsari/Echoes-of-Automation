Part of the goal is toscreen tens of thousands of individualsto make sure that they would follow his orders as president.Trump is also thinking of issuingmany pardonsto overturn the work completed by the Department of Justice under President Joe Biden prosecuting him, his advisors and his allies. He wants the authority toremove labor protectionsfor the civil service so that he can hire and firefederal workersat will, while dramatically extending his power into therealm of educationin particular. Federal prosecutors would be brought in to curb local crime, and the White House would tighten its grip over the Department of Justice, continuing to shatter the separation that emerged after Watergate.Just in case anyone is missing the President Richard Nixon comparison, Trump would start impounding congressional funds again - refusing to spend money that the House and Senate appropriated - which is exactly what caused Congress to pass major reforms in1974centralizing the budget process and constraining the use of impoundments.AsThe New York Timesreports, Trump and his associates want to \"alter the balance of power by increasing the president's authority over every part of the federal government that now operates, by either law or tradition, with any measure of independence from political interference by the White House, according to a review of his campaign proposals and interviews with people close to him.\"To do so, the Times continued, \"Mr. Trump intends to bring independent agencies - like the Federal Communications Commission, which makes and enforces rules for television and internet companies, and the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces various antitrust and other consumer protection rules against businesses - under direct presidential control.\"To be sure, the growing authority of the presidency is nothing new. Nor is it a Republican story. Executive power has steadily expanded since the founding of the republic, accelerating greatly the 1930s and 1940s when President Franklin Roosevelt vastlyexpanded the executive branch.Although liberals had once praised this power as a necessary source of centralization which would allow decisive leadership to address the nation's needs, hope turned to fear when Nixon revealed how that authority could be used for dangerous ends to go after opponents, reward loyal supporters and to conduct illicit and even illegal operations. As the Watergate investigation was getting underway, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. acknowledged that he had previously not fully recognized the dangers of empowering presidents until he wrote his 1973 book, \"Imperial Presidency.\"Although Congress passed a series of reforms in the 1970s - such as the 1973War Powers Act- that curtailed the presidency, the institution continued to expand its reach in the decades to come. Some reforms, such as a 1978 law that createdan independent prosecutorwho could investigate certain allegations in the executive branch, were allowed to expire. Others were overturned, and others proved ineffectual.Following the terrorist attacks on 9/11,President George W. Bushpushed for another vast expansion of executive power on the grounds that it was essential to protect national security.Presidential power has been a bipartisan affair. Democrats have used the authority for their own ends. Frustrated with the Republican Congress, for instance,President Bill Clintonused executive action to expand the environmental programs of the federal government. Most recently, Biden leaned on executive power to advance astudent loan forgiveness programthat the courts ultimately overturned.While presidents from both parties have deployed executive power, not all presidents have intentionally mapped out plans to go after their enemies without any legal justification. This is what Trump has in mind and it's downright Nixonian. It's also why he represents a threat to the Oval Office that goes beyond the typical issue of consolidating power.Trump has shown quite clearly how he is willing to ignore any institutional or normative guardrails that have been in place - fromleveraging foreign aidas a way to obtain campaign fodder on an opponent to rejecting thelegitimate results of an election. He has continually used hisbully pulpit, inralliesand on social media, to target opponents and inflame his army of supporters.The ability to manipulate the power of his position has been made clear, though, as the findings about January 6revealed. What many initially thought was yet another moment of Trumpian chaos was actually asystematic, carefully orchestratedand quite sweeping plan to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to multiple congressional and legal investigations.If it had not been for the action of key individuals, from formerVice President Mike Pencetonumerous federal judges, the plan could have been successful. The lesson should not be that the system worked, but how close we came to a total disaster and how our democracy depended on people doing the right thingat the right time.Voters should be paying close attention right now. When presidents use presidential power in dangerous ways, not only does this present a dangerous stress test at the moment, but it also means that over time, the expansions of power are rarely cut back. When Trump breaks governing norms, he also establishes dangerous new ones.Opinion By Julian Zelizer, CNNTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
