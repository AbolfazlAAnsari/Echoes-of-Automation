It almost makes me feel sorry for the few decent Tory politcians left, but it has gone too far. Corruption is a disease and there is no cure. Roll on the next election!Judith StaveleyAddress SuppliedMusical chairs at the SNPThe nextgeneral electionwill not be until 2024, yet alreadyseveral current SNP MPshave indicated their intention not to stand again as candidates. It is predicted that more will follow.Perhaps they have at last realised that their presence at Westminster is pointless. They are not there to represent their constituents, and certainly not there to represent “Scotland”. They are there to complain and agitate fortheir separatist cause, by asking grievance-laden questions and, from time to time, disrupting proceedings.If I were an SNP member I would be somewhat concerned. No doubt some of these retiring MPs will seek a seat at Holyrood. It’s as if there aren’tenough internal squabbleswithin the SNP as it is without contests for seats and places on lists.We mere spectators will be laying in the popcorn.Jill StephensonEdinburghThe British public deserves betterI don’t live inMhairi Black’s constituency. I don’t live in Scotland. I’m not even Scottish. But I am devastated that parliament haslost the amazing Mhairi Black.Black’s reasons for leaving make her decision to stand down as an MP at the next election even more devastating. She says that she is tired, but it’s the reason for that tiredness that holds the sting:toxicity.Black is one of the most eloquent, straight-talking members of parliament I have ever seen. Every time she stood up in the House, she would make a well-researched, well-thought-out speech that had the power to make others sit up and listen. They may not agree with her, but I would like to bet that she was admired across the floor.But the electorate has now lost her. Because of howtoxic politics has become.Parliament urgently needs a reset button. Yes, to get rid of the toxicity, but also to return to a more respectful discourse. As an avid watcher of Prime Minister’s Questions, I now find myself switching off. No longer do we hear the answer to the opposition’s question. Or even a partial answer. We are assailed with a pre-written, rehearsed word salad that bears precisely zero relevance to the question that has been asked only seconds earlier. If we’re lucky, there’ll be a few personal insults thrown in, with a sprinkle of mockery of the party opposite.The British public deserve better. We are living through the biggestcost of livingcrisis for decades, and when we turn to those we elected for answers, we see a bunch of people who seem more set on scoring political points against each other, than giving us some hope for the near future.It seems that those who entered political life to really try to make a difference to people’s lives, the Mhairi Blacks’ of this world, have been defeated by thosewhose toxicity makescontinuing in politics unbearable. And the losers are the British electorate.We are now left with what seems like a carousel of (mainly men) taking the top cabinet jobs. Having a go at all departments at some point in their political careers.Politics seems to be in as much turmoil as the whole of the UK at the moment. Something has to change. And fast.Karen BrittainYorkPoor, poor FarageWhen the private bank Couttsclosed Nigel Farage’s accountrecently and as a reaction, he posted a six-minute video on Twitter claiming he was the victim of “serious political persecution” by banks because he championed Brexit.Coutts have since explained that theirdecision had nothing to dowith Farage’s politics, he simply fell below their minimum financial threshold. They claim to have offered Farage aregular account with NatWest(which owns Coutts) but apparently, that wasn’t good enough for the supposed “man of the people”.The most disgusting aspect of the whole incident is that when confronted with Coutts’ decision, Farage said he considered leaving the UK.How interesting that Farage, who built his political career promoting ananti-immigrant platform, was considering emigrating abroad to escape his financial woes. How ironic.Sasha SimicLondon"
