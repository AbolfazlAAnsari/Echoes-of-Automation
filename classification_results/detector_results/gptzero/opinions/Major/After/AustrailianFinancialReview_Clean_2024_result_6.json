If superannuants receive the dividend, we will, through former prime minister John Howard's magic, end up with $1000 and the ATO with $0.While appreciating the tax commissioner's generosity, it's not apparent to me what the social, taxation or economic policy basis is for such largesse.Carlo UrsidaKensington, VicNuclear push is futileAlthough not the main reason nuclear power is unviable in Australia, voter resistance is an important factor (\"Voters don't want to live next to nuclear reactors\", May 7).Even though modern reactors are much safer than their predecessors, the public was assured that the earlier facilities were safe too. When this turned out to be wrong, people stopped trusting the nuclear industry. And with Fukushima still fresh in their minds, who can blame them?It's unlikely this sentiment can be turned around in Australia, so spending time and money trying to do so is futile - especially when cheaper sources of energy are available.Let's just go with renewables and avoid the spat over nuclear.Ken EnderbyConcord, NSWTake the hint fromLatrobe ValleyThe Coalition continues scoring own goals with its nuclear kite flying (\"Voters don't want to live next to nuclear reactors\", May 7).Nuclear energy may appeal to some for whom acting now on the climate crisis is too difficult, too expensive, and too damaging to coal and gas.However, people in the LaTrobe Valley, when faced with the prospect of a nuclear power plant, are saying no. Why would they welcome a hugely complicated technology, with about a 20-year build time, along with safety risks that put air pollution in the shade?Fiona ColinMalvern East, VicIsrael was right toclose Al JazeeraIsrael was totally justified in shutting down Al Jazeera (\" 'Dark day for media' : Netanyahu shuts down Al Jazeera's operation\", May 7).Al Jazeera is the mouthpiece of the autocratic Qatari government. Qatar hosts the leaders of and finances the Hamas terrorist group. Al Jazeera has acted as a mouthpiece for Hamas.In 2022, when the European Union banned the Russian state-owned media outlet RT over its constant misinformation about the Ukraine war, or in 2012, when the UK banned Iran's Press TV, that wasn't seen as a blow to democracy.Robbie GoreBrighton East, VicQuantum can lift usout of the quarryHere we go again, with Alex Downer sledging the Albanese government's efforts to stimulate the sluggish economy - which the Coalition government left behind. (\"South America shows Made in Australia in practice\", May 6).Fortunately, we now have a government that is proposing a quantum leap into the future, by supporting new manufacturing.When John F. Kennedy became US president, he showed what imaginative leadership could achieve when he vowed to put a man on the moon within 10 years. That objective was costing 5 per cent of their GDP. It was a hell of an investment, but the new technology led to myriad world-leading products, which created wealth for the US.Hopefully, our quantum leap will take us out of the quarry. We urgently need to start making world-beating products from our abundance of raw materials. Products that will make us all rich.Jeffrey NewmanIvanhoe, VictoriaWipe all HECS debtGiven that HECS/HELP debts total more than $74 billion and a significant percentage of that will never be repaid, perhaps it is time to consider wiping the debt altogether. (Labor to wipe $3b from students' HECS debt\", May 6).A well-educated workforce is essential. Investing taxpayers' dollars in our young is in the economic and social interest of this nation. It would be an election winner for any party too.Michael J GambleBelmont, Vic"
