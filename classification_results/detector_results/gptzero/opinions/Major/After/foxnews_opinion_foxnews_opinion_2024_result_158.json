Because where else could the daughter of immigrants rise to the highest office in the land, shattering glass ceilings all along the way? Only in America.Of course, she had plenty of examples to show her what was possible. Coming to America from India at only 19-years-old, her mother became a celebrated biologist. Her father had come from Jamaica, studied at UC Berkeley and became a renowned economist and professor at Stanford. So, they raised her not only to see what is and what has been, but to imagine what is possible -- not who we are, but who we can be.It worked because she thrived on that possibility. It took her to Vanier College in Montreal, Howard University and the University of California College of Law, San Francisco. It drove her to organize for justice. It helped her prosecute murderers and rapists as the District Attorney’s chief of the Career Criminal Division and eventually becomeSan Francisco’s district attorneyherself, then attorney general, U.S. senator and vice president.IT'S OFFICIAL: VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS GOES OVER THE TOP AND CLINCHES DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATIONIt gave her the moral clarity to fight the big banks who paid for their own misdeeds by foreclosing on working families. It gave her the strength to fight for students and veterans who were taken advantage of by a for-profit education company and it gave her the tools to win bringing rent relief and badly needed resources to low-income communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, to deliver student debt relief to countless American, to help create millions of new jobs and more.From campaign calls to rallies to local volunteers knocking on doors on a Saturday morning, folks are getting tuned in all across this nation like we’ve never seen before. It’s unprecedented. It’s historic.Now, because it’s her time and her turn, she is zooming through and into history and nobody deserves it more. Yes, we recognize that politics is a contact sport and we know that the attacks will come. In fact, some are coming already.But we also recognize that a lot of the folks wearing different jerseys than we are keep running the same old plays of racism, bigotry, misogyny, ignorance and hate. From birtherism 2.0 and dismissing the vice president as a DEI hire, to claiming she \"became Black\" and purposefully mispronouncing her name, it’s clear that the closer we get to history, the louder and sicker they become.2024 CASH DASH: HARRIS LAPS TRUMP IN LATEST FUNDRAISING FIGURESThat’s OK. She can take it because the contrast is easy to see.It’s not just about the prosecutor vs. the felon or even the undeniable truth vs. rapid fire lies. It’s about progress vs extremism. It’s about who we can be.Think about the landmark legislation Vice President Harris helped marshal through Congress and into law. Think about all the executive orders to raise wages, fight climate change, protect reproductive freedom and more that she helped make reality. Now compare that to the four years of deprivation and degradation we saw under Donald J. Trump.1 OF THESE 5 DEMOCRATS COULD BE HARRIS' RUNNING MATEOf course, elections are about the future forecast. So, compareformer President Donald Trump’s all but official endorsement of the plans laid out inProject 2025to President Harris signing a real bipartisan border security bill into law, protecting a woman’s right to control her own body and make her own health care decisions, extending the child tax credit that cut child poverty in half, building on the more than 15 million jobs she already helped create.Compare Trump’s plan to declare martial law to President Harris strengthening the middle class, growing small businesses, expanding health care, keeping medical debt off your credit report and making sure no one raises taxes on Americans who make less than $400,000 per year.While Harris knows that affordable internet is amustnot a plus for all Americans, theMAGA Republicansrefuse to fund the Affordable Connectivity Program. And while they’re screaming about imagined crises, we’re talking about raising wages, closing the wealth gap, lowering the cost of childcare and making sure getting sick doesn’t mean going broke.That’s just a hint of the differences.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONSimply put, Vice President Harris is a once-in-a-generation candidate who has generated more power and energy for this country than Duke Power.
