The president's son plead not guilty to federal gun charges after his original plea deal fell through in July.(The Image Direct for Fox News Digital)How do we know this? Because Weiss spent five years dithering in the face of compelling evidence that Hunter committed far more serious felonies of influence peddling, bribery, conspiracy, money laundering, foreign lobbying crimes, obstruction of justice, tax fraud andtax evasion.  Those schemes netted tens of millions of dollars from overseas adversaries by appearing to sell access to Joe Biden and promises of future influence.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONYet, no charges have ever been brought. Indeed, Weiss deliberately allowed the statutes of limitations to run on many of the suspected crimes.  Hunter’s lawyers were tipped off about a surprise interview.  A search of Hunter’s storage locker was halted despite probable cause being established. Privileged information was secretly divulged.  Investigators were blocked from asking aboutJoe Biden’s involvement, instructed to ignore Hunter’s incriminating laptop, and told to ignore the immense paper trail of overseas wire transfers.  A written agreement to bring six felony charges against Hunter was scuttled.Who does that?  A corrupt or incompetent U.S. Attorney who’s been running an obvious protection racket to shield his boss, the president, who is implicated as complicit in his son’s scams and schemes.Weiss almost got away with it untiltwo IRS whistleblowers stepped forwardto reveal the chicanery.  They informed Congress of the constant political interference and preferential treatment that slow-walked the investigation, suppressed evidence, and diverted the case.Now exposed, perhapsWeiss has experienced an epiphany.  Maybe he will suddenly embrace the rule of law and aggressively pursue the escalating evidence of pervasive crimes committed.But something tells me that lottery tickets are a better bet.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GREGG JARRETTGregg Jarrett is a Fox News legal analyst and commentator, and formerly worked as a defense attorney and adjunct law professor.
