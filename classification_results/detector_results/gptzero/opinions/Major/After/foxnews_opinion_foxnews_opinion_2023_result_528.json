He stated that his team submitted \"a targeting packet and a request to strike only a few days prior\" to the Abbey Gate attack, but the request was denied. The interview indicates that the target of the strike was an ISIS-K safehouse in Nangarhar Province that the miliary ultimately struck on the 27th — the day after the attack.One of the ISIS-K operatives killed in that strike was Kabir Aidi, a terrorist who was involved in \"attack planning,\" distributed \"explosives and suicide vests,\" and was \"directly connected to threat streams in Kabul\" throughout the evacuation.Aidi was \"connected to the ISIS-K leaders that coordinated\" the Abbey Gate bombing. McKenzie said the Nangarhar strike \"had an effect on quieting down\" ISIS-K and \"disrupted some of their plans\" for follow-on attacks — raising the important question of whether the strike might have disrupted the August 26 attack, too.Taken together, the statements from both officers indicate that the military identified the location of an ISIS-K operative who facilitated the Abbey Gate attack, but they declined to strike his location days before the bombing, apparently to avoid angering the Taliban.Similarly, an officer interviewed as part of the Abbey Gate investigation stated that \"intelligence officers at HKIA knew that ISIS-K was staging in a hotel 2-3 kilometers west of HKIA, and [General Donahue] asked the [Taliban] to conduct an assault on the hotel, but they never did.\"In this image from video provided by Omar Haidari and taken on Thursday, Aug. 19, 2021, which shows a baby being lifted across a wall at Kabul Airport in Afghanistan by US soldiers.(Omar Haidari via AP)This officer was responsible for briefing unit-level military intelligence officers about potential threats and thus would have had firsthand knowledge of the actionable intelligence known to U.S. forces.The statements of those three officers are consistent with Marine Sergeant Tyler Vargas-Andrews’s recent testimony to Congress that his sniper team was warned about an impending ISIS-K attack at Abbey Gate and received a detailed description of the suspected bomber.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONVargas-Andrews also testified that, \"around 2 am, [intelligence officers] confirmed the suicide bomber in the vicinity\" of Abbey Gate. Later that afternoon, the sniper team identified a man who matched the description and profile of the suspected bomber, and an Army PSYOPS team provided secondary confirmation.When they asked for permission to shoot, however, their battalion commander replied that he did not have \"engagement authority\" and that he didn’t know who did. The suspected bomber disappeared into the crowd, and carnage ensued soon after.The White House has never accounted for these facts, perhaps because no explanation is sufficient. It has never publicly identified Logari as the bomber — doing so would invite uncomfortable questions about who he was and where he came from.It has never discussed the intelligence it received before the attack, even though it publicly warned about an impending ISIS-K bombing for days beforehand. And it has never responded to Vargas-Andrews’s claims. Worst of all, Biden has never publicly spoken the names of the 13 Americans killed in the attack.The White House wants the public to forget about its deadly incompetence and move on without demands for accountability.
