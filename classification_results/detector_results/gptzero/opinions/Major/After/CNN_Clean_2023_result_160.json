In the 19th century, gravestones were often dedicated to a \"loving friend\" or \"devoted companion,\" suggesting pets were mostly considered important friends.By the early 20th century, pets had become members of the family -- evidenced by the appearance of family surnames on the gravestones, and loving epitaphs written by \"Mummy and Daddy.\"Society's changing attitude towards the role of animals in the afterlife can also be found. Fast-forward a few decades later, and gravestones were more likely to reference a reunion then earlier ones. For example, the owners of Denny, the \"brave little cat\" buried in an east London cemetery in 1952, wrote on his epitaph \"God bless until we meet again.\"I wonder what the epitaphs in Barcelona's new cemetery will reveal about modern Catalan relationships with animals.Over time, our ways of treating our animal dead appear to reflect an even closer relationship in life. Once strictly forbidden by law, the last decade saw many jurisdictions, like the state of New York, allowing theco-burial of cremated animals and people, which will undoubtedly lead to changing funerary and commemoration practices for both humans and animals.Modern mourningFor me, the most remarkable similarity between modern and historic pet cemeteries is the striking evidence for the heartbreak and taboos around grieving for animals.The connection that someone has with their pet can be just as strong and just as significant as their relationships with other humans. Yet today, as in over 100 years ago, individuals continue to struggle to find the appropriate outlet to express their pain, hiding heartache for fear of the social repercussions that might come with public acknowledgment of the existence of such a bond.The RSPCA reassures the publicon its websitethat they should not feel shame for their grief. In the UK, charities like theBlue CrossandRainbow Bridge Pet Loss Grief Centeroffer counseling to bereaved humans.Close relationships between people and animals have existed for millennia, but in western European cultures, there were few acceptable ways to mourn that relationship. As society becomes more accepting of the importance of human-animal relationships to our collective wellbeing, it is not surprising to see us follow rituals resembling those we use to mourn the loss of our closest human relationships.At an estimated cost of (EURO)200 ($217) per service at the new Barcelona cemetery, it is important to acknowledge that this opportunity to grieve will not be financially available to everyone in the city.This will not be a space for all of the city's pets. Pet owners may opt to keep cremated remains within their home or spread out ashes in a meaningful location instead. Online forums anddigital pet cemeteriesalso provide other opportunities to commemorate the relationship and express grief.Whether one chooses a pet cemetery or not, there are many acceptable ways to express your grief -- and to remember your relationship with the important animals in your life.Opinion by Eric TourignyTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
