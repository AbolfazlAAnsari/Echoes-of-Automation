After all, when the cry for independence and personal choice overwhelm the public good and saving lives, there is little or no hope.So, just as in other areas of our culture, money talks, racism flourishes and the disregard for those in need is again exposed. And the result is that Dr. Reinhart’s legitimate arguments will fall on deaf ears. Sad but true.James J. CullenYarmouth Port, Mass.The writer spent 40 years as a C.F.O. and C.E.O. for not-for-profit hospitals.To the Editor:While Eric Reinhart’s essay is a thoughtful assessment of the pitfalls of our free-market-based health system, he misses the mark on burnout. Doctors are burned out from overwork, period.In my role as a primary care physician leader in a large academic health system, I am a daily witness to the emotional toll of electronic inbox task overload, and I coach clinicians who are struggling.Never have I heard a clinician say they are on the verge of leaving medicine because of “dwindling faith” in the U.S. health care system. They leave because they are finishing chart documentation, reviewing data and responding to patient portal messages late into the evenings at home when they should be spending time with their families.Our health care system is ailing, yet any fix — including universal health care — is not going to suddenly simplify the grueling work conditions of primary care clinicians. Ideological relief will not fix burnout. Managing patient expectations, more efficient work flows, robust care teams and better work-life balance will.Jeffrey H. MillsteinWoodbury Heights, N.J.The writer is regional medical director at Penn Primary Care.To the Editor:I appreciated and can relate to Eric Reinhart’s essay on demoralized physicians. His concerns have wider application beyond physicians. Nurses have been working under increasingly dire circumstances of staff shortages, mandatory overtime, and large and sometimes unsafe patient assignments, to name but a few of the challenges my nursing colleagues face.Meanwhile, C.E.O. bonuses in some health care organizations are tied to how well the organization investment portfolio does with little accountability for quality outcomes and staff satisfaction.If physicians and nurses, and their professional organizations, would band together and rise up to demand a reorganization of the entire health care system, we would serve our patients better, decrease costs and find increased job satisfaction.Jane BarnsteinerMiramar Beach, Fla.The writer, a registered nurse, is professor emerita at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing and an editor for the American Journal of Nursing.This article appeared in print on page SR11."
