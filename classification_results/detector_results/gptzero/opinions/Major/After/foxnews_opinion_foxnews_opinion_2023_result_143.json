Trump's disgraced former lawyer, Michael Cohen, arranged the payment.In a February 2018 letter to the FEC he stated that \"the payment in question does not constitute a campaign contribution\" and that he acted on his own.In April of 2018, he told his ex-attorney, Robert Costello, that Trump had no involvement and was unaware of the transfer of money. This is reflected in contemporaneous notes maintained by Costello and turned over to the district attorney.Yet, Bragg appears to have concealed this vital information from the grand jury. When he testified, Costello says he was shocked that the panel has not been shown his voluminous files that corroborated Cohen’s original explanation and exonerated Trump. Withholding exculpatory evidence is an unconscionable act. It is the duty of a prosecutor to see that justice is done, not to gain an indictment and conviction. Hiding evidence is a serious breach of legal ethics.Bragg’s reliance on Cohen —an admitted liar who went to prison, in part, for perjury— is also ethically suspect.The disbarred lawyer is now peddling a different story and has made no secret of his hatred for Trump.Cohen has every motive to spinmore lies in his quest for retribution against his former boss. Is Cohen lying now or was he lying five years ago when he told authorities that Trump was never involved? Any half-decent defense attorney will easily shred such a dishonest witness on cross-examination, making Bragg look foolish.The ethical imperative of a prosecutor is to be fair and equitable. Bragg is neither. He ran for office vowing to pursue Trump. He had no access to evidence, yet he prejudged an indictment that had not been brought and pre-ordained the grand jury’s outcome. The district attorney now wants to engineer a conviction by contorting the law.The DA’s former assistant, Mark Pomerantz, who helped orchestrate Bragg’s feeble legal theory, penned a book openly admitting that Trump was targeted in a politically motivated investigation.Pomerantz vented his contempt for the former president because \"he posed a real danger to the country and to the ideals that mattered to me.\"Disagreeing with someone’s views or harboring personal animosity is not a basis forcriminal prosecution. But Bragg has chosen to abandon the duty of a prosecutor to adhere faithfully to the principle of \"equality under the law.\"In so doing, he has weaponized the law for political gain. It is a disgraceful abuse of power.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GREGG JARRETTGregg Jarrett is a Fox News legal analyst and commentator, and formerly worked as a defense attorney and adjunct law professor.
