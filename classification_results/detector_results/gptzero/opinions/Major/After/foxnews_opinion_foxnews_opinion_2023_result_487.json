The prosecution's priority is securing justice, not securing billable hours for big-city attorneys.\"Again, that’s as absurd as it is unseemly. Prosecutors do not drop charges just because defense lawyers file motions (which, to repeat, is the standard procedure, not a \"litigious distraction\"). They will only drop a charge, in this context, because it turns out that the defense lawyers were correct that the charge is legally invalid.The proper thing, moreover, is simply to drop the charge and move on. If a prosecutor says anything at all, it should be to fall on her sword. But far from admitting error, this prosecutor pretends that she is dismissing a charge because it would be too much of a bother to answer the defense motion – which would certainly make me angry if I were a member of the Hutchins family. And then she takes a gratuitous shot at Baldwin’s high-price \"big-city attorneys\" – which would certainly make me angry if I were the judge.It does not speak well of the district attorney in the case, Mary Carmack-Altwies, that she seems incapable of conceding error.I continue to believethat this accident should not be a criminal case. It should be settled in the civil justice system. On that score, we should note that Baldwin has already paid one settlement to some members of Hutchins’ family, and it now appears that others are poised to file suit.But this is not about whether the case should be brought criminally but about how it should be prosecuted. Incompetent and snarky is rarely a good combination, and it is an especially bad one in a prosecutor, whose job involves maintaining the court’s confidence and convincing jurors based on the strength of the state’s allegations.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANDREW McCARTHYAndrew C.
