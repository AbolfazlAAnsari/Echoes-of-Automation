            "inputText": "By Paige MacPhersonEvidence keeps rolling in that COVID school closures set students back significantly, harming disadvantaged kids most. To get back on track, Canadian kids need a scholastic \"power-up\" (to quote the countless numbers of them who spent too much time out of class and at home playing video games). Without it, research shows, they will make less money as adults, face greater inequality and live in a slower-growing economy.Even The New York Times now acknowledges that closing schools set children's progress in math and reading back two decades as measured by test scores, a reversal researchers(https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/opinion/pandemic-school-learning-loss.html) say may reduce the lifetime earnings of today's kids and significantly hamper the economy.Data modelling(https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/329961592483383689/pdf/Simulating-the-Potential-Impacts-of-COVID-19-School-Closures-on-Schooling-and-Learning-Outcomes-A-Set-of-Global-Estimates.pdf) from the World Bank estimates a global toll of learning losses in the trillions of dollars, with per-student reduced lifetime earnings in the tens of thousands of dollars, exacerbating inequality. In Canada, student achievement has declined post-COVID, which is not surprising considering how often governments and education administrators closed schools during the pandemic. In Ontario, schools were closed province-wide for 27 weeks, and that doesn't include individual school closures.Mental(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/covid-19-essay8-forgotten-demographic-benefits-and-cost-of-school-closures.pdf) health(https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/the-new-brain/202308/covid-19-school-closures-harmed-childrens-mental-health) suffering(https://www.science.org/content/article/pandemic-school-closures-were-especially-hard-mental-health-younger-more-vulnerable) among kids in Canada reached crisis levels, screentime soared(https://www.edweek.org/leadership/kids-screen-time-rose-during-the-pandemic-and-stayed-high-thats-a-problem/2023/02) and learning suffered greatly. According to research(https://www.aims.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AIMS-19003_Stormy-Days_JN0719_F2.pdf) pre-dating COVID, lost classroom time compounds absenteeism and harms student achievement and social growth. British research(https://educationhub.blog.gov.uk/2023/05/18/school-attendance-important-risks-missing-day/) shows that better attendance leads to better grades and increased well-being and overall development in both elementary and high school.We don't want to condemn Canadian children to living poorer lives in a worsened economy. So what can we do now to mitigate COVID learning loss? Here are four priorities.First, make sure kids are in class more often. Some education experts were warning(https://www.aims.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AIMS-19003_Stormy-Days_JN0719_F2.pdf) about lost classroom time even before the pandemic. Rain or snow, all provinces should pull up their boots and get their kids to school. When that's truly impossible, education consultant Paul Bennett advises, schools(https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/sorry-kids-it-s-time-to-cancel-snow-days-with-rise-of-online-learning-expert-says-1.5311600) should use the online techniques learned during COVID so education continues even when the weather outside is frightful.But it's not just bad weather that interrupts learning. Strikes and other work stoppages keep kids out of school on a rolling basis across Canada. This month it's schools in Quebec that are closed(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/teachers-strike-quebec-no-income-1.7030620) due to union action. In October(https://globalnews.ca/news/10034607/teachers-strike-vote-2023-explainer/), close to 100 per cent of Ontario's English-language elementary teachers voted in favour of a strike - after teacher strikes(https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/provincewide-strike-sees-two-million-ont-schoolchildren-out-of-class-1.4822131?cache=vpigvemdpalu) in Ontario shut two million kids out of their classrooms in 2020. In Nova Scotia(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/strike-halifax-early-childhood-educators-support-staff-wednesday-may-10-1.6838207) last spring, support staff strikes meant pre-primary kids and those with exceptional needs couldn't go to school. The vast majority(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/where-our-students-are-educated-measuring-student-enrolment-in-canada-2022) of Canadian students are educated in government-run schools. They should not have to accept teacher absenteeism. In charter and independent schools, where teachers are not required to join unions and pay dues, students largely avoid the learning loss associated with labour strife.Second, quality teachers matter. Union agreements make it hard for governments to reward excellent teachers based on merit. They also often make it difficult(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/provinces-should-fast-track-teacher-certification) to hire well qualified people, especially those with expertise in specific subjects, who may not have several years of formal teacher training. Provinces need to ensure that teacher certification isn't just protectionism for unionized teachers' jobs.Third, kids need to learn facts and be taught with tried-and-true methods. The swing toward \"progressive\" curriculum fads - history without facts(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/holocaust-education-in-schools-is-a-good-start-and-shows-why-facts-matter), \"discovery math,\" reading without phonics - and away from memorization and content-rich learning makes it harder for kids to thrive. For kids, facts form the basis of knowledge, critical thinking and understanding. Fads of the sort we see in British Columbia's new curriculum(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-bcs-new-curriculum-will-shortchange-students/) do not.Finally, testing matters. Standardized testing is on the decline(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/decline-of-standardized-testing-in-canada#:~:text=Even%20in%20the%20provinces%20where,is%20down%20to%20only%2010%25. ) across Canada. To help kids improve, we first need to understand how they're doing. Standardized testing is the only fair way to measure student performance. According to recent Leger polling, the vast majority of Canadian parents of kids in K-12 schools support(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/strong-parental-support-for-standardized-testing-across-canada) it.Opinion: One way to increase productivity - ensure all kids can read(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-one-way-to-increase-productivity-ensure-all-kids-can-read)Matthew Lau: Government-run daycare isn't delivering. Is anyone surprised?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/government-run-daycare-isnt-delivering-anyone-surprised)Philip Cross: Young people's unhappiness isn't older generations' fault(https://financialpost.com/opinion/young-peoples-unhappiness-not-older-generations-fault)Closing schools during COVID shortchanged our kids. A rigorous return to classroom learning, with trusted methods and empowered teachers, won't make up for this historic learning loss overnight. But it would be a good start.Paige MacPherson is associate director of education policy at the Fraser Institute. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved."
