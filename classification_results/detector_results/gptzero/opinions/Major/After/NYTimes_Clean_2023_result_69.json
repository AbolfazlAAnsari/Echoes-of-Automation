Also: An alternative to a Fox apology; aging lesbians; honoring subpoenas.To the Editor:Re “Fox News Ousts Carlson, a Voice of the Far Right” (front page, April 25):Tucker Carlson’s firing by Fox News is being covered as big news (everywhere except, of course, at Fox News). The coverage includes speculation about whether the firing heralds a change of direction for Fox News away from peddling sensationalist conspiracy theories to its primary audience.The trove of texts and emails made public in connection with Dominion’s lawsuit against Fox News revealed that Mr. Carlson’s private opinions sometimes diverged from what he voiced on his TV show. Knowing thatMr. Carlson’s résuméincluded previous work as a conservative voice with such liberal or reality-based news outlets like CNN, MSNBC and PBS, perhaps we should not be surprised that the more extreme Tucker Carlson who was presented on Fox News each night was to an unknown degree a performance.Fox News’s business model involves presenting sensationalist, conspiracy-laden fodder to appeal to America’s angry, frightened right wing. This has been so whether the characters have been named Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Bill O’Reilly or Tucker Carlson. The roles those people played have been the same.The actor Tucker Carlson has been fired by Fox News, but nobody should assume that Fox News has abandoned the character that he played on TV. His role will be filled by another actor with a different name but playing the same role.Paul JordanFlint, Mich.To the Editor:You state that Tucker Carlson’s ouster from Fox News “was an ignominious turn in the career of a man who had once been rumored as a possible presidential contender.”I wouldn’t be too quick to assume that such chances are dead in the water. Freed from the responsibilities of daily broadcasting, Mr. Carlson might well decide he has nothing to lose by throwing his hat in the ring, if not in 2024, possibly in 2028. Or further down the road. (He is only 53.)However fed up Rupert Murdoch and a lot of people at Fox may be with him, he enjoys massive popularity with millions of Americans. Watch him spin his dismissal into an injustice against a brave and patriotic truth teller persecuted by powerful and corrupt media figures.Americans relish the spectacle of individuals who fight back and triumph after devastating setbacks. Much as I hope Tucker Carlson goes away and never enters the public arena again in any capacity, that scenario seems unlikely.David EnglishActon, Mass.To the Editor:I’m disappointed that Fox News has parted ways with Tucker Carlson. I agreed with Mr. Carlson’s views more than I disagreed with them. And I appreciated his overall support for the anti-abortion and pro-family cause.Matt C. AbbottLake Geneva, Wis.The writer is a Catholic commentator for RenewAmerica.com.To the Editor:Tucker Carlson was Fox’s top ratings draw, so his unceremonious firing is news indeed. The full story will probably leak out, but among the obvious reasons are Mr. Carlson’s emails criticizing Fox’s top management, a pending lawsuit against Mr. Carlson alleging rampant sexism and antisemitic behavior, and his messages handing Dominion a wealth of evidence used in the $787.5 million settlement against Fox.But I suspect that Fox’s hand was forced by theinsurance carriersthat I assume will pay the bulk of that massive settlement. Those companies will also be on the hook for other potential Fox liabilities, such as theparallel lawsuit brought by Smartmatic. Those companies may understandably have concluded that Mr. Carlson was just too much of a loose cannon and had to go.Greg SchwedNew YorkThe writer is a lawyer.An Alternative to a Fox ApologyTo the Editor:Re “Dominion’s C.E.O.: We Settled the Lawsuit Against Fox News, but We’re Not Done Yet,” by John Poulos (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, April 21):Mr. Poulos may be right that an apology by Fox wasn’t worth obtaining because it would have been “forced, insincere and limited.”But there’s another remedy often applied in defamation cases: a simple retraction. Heartfelt or not, a retraction delivered during the same programs that spread falsehoods about Dominion and the 2020 election at least would have set the record straight.It would have told Fox viewers what they still don’t hear on Fox News, and apparently never will.Stuart AltschulerNew YorkAging Lesbians, Figuring Out Their Life PathsTo the Editor:Re “To Grow Old and Gay,” by Cris Beam (Opinion guest essay, April 9):Ms. Beam is right. There is no road map. But for many years we have found ways to carve our own map. Many of us live in cities to make it easier to blend in. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy.I feel very fortunate living in New York City. My partner (using “wife” has never felt OK) and I have been together for 44 years. We had our daughter in 1986. We had to “educate” many of her teachers and doctors and neighbors as she grew up.When she went to college she picked a school that was very progressive and easily shared that she had two moms. These days our granddaughter takes for granted that she has two grandmothers who are married.So, as we all (gay and straight) age, our hair turns gray and our needs are the same. We want to live with dignity and feel secure knowing whoever we love will be by our side.Beth RosenBronxTo the Editor:Cris Beam’s essay hit me in the heart. I’m a lesbian, 90 years old, living alone, never had a road map for this journey.She writes, “My future was void of vision.” That’s about how I’ve lived my whole life. Growing up in the 1940s I had no gay models; I didn’t even know that there was such a thing as women being attracted to women.After I met my future partner of 65 years in 1956 and we somehow managed to get into a relationship, we never talked about any commitment, any future together. We just got up each day and did it again. That lack of a plan resulted in our living the last 50 years of our lives together in a small town in one of the reddest counties in Idaho.When my love was 79 she had a fall, which caused brain damage and a slow deterioration until she died 12 years later.We loved it here in this isolated little town, but we certainly missed out on having any community with queer folk. As Ms. Beam says, “The trouble with not being seen is we don’t always know how to see ourselves.”At 90 I’m still learning how to see myself truly. Just the other day, I was able to say “I’m pretty butch” to friends and feel joyful about it.Instead of a road map, I’ve had the love of my life and a wonderful community of friends. That’s all I needed, but I was fortunate. We do need a society that sees us, appreciates us, and in which we have a full place at the table.Bernadine BerrySalmon, IdahoA Question for Jim JordanTo the Editor:Re “Judge Rules Lawmakers May Ask Ex-Prosecutor About Trump Inquiry” (news article, April 20):Given thatRepresentative Jim Jordan failed to honor a subpoenaissued to him by a congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, why should anyone be compelled to honor a subpoena issued by Mr. Jordan?
