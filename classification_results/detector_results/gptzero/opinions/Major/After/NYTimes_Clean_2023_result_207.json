Unfortunately, I have often cared for patients who, out of fear of being perceived as “old,” refuse the aide or assistive device that would let them do something they’d love to do.For society’s part, my votes are for: 1) changing Medicare’s mandate so that payment for hearing aids, dentures and home health aides gets priority over minimally effective, outrageously expensive medications for dementia; and 2) public transportation that is safe and accessible, enhancing the opportunity for all, not just older adults, to have an enjoyable, meaningful and connected life.This challenge isn’t easy. I suggest that our deliberations be guided by this familiar advice: Accept the things we really cannot change, have the courage to change the things we can, and have the wisdom to know the difference.Rosanne M. LeipzigNew YorkThe writer is a professor of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the author of the book “Honest Aging.”To the Editor:Any discussion about America aging gracefully should include the dimension of aging that is about responsible elderhood — an elderhood not focused on oneself, but on a responsibility to younger generations.For myself, a 78-year-old photographer, and for many other elders I know, there is a heightened awareness of the precariousness of the future, and a wish to do something toward helping that future be a better one, not just for our own grandchildren, but for all children, for all life.Personally, I put my art into service by producing an annual eco calendar with my nature photography, “In Love With Earth,” to raise money for a local climate and sustainability nonprofit, Daily Acts. Also, along with many other gray- and white-haired people, I volunteer for community programs, show up for town hall meetings, give talks to groups, attend protest marches, etc. Among us also are elders who are actively raising, minding and/or mentoring their grandchildren.I don’t think this is unique to my community. I suspect there are millions of older Americans who take actions on behalf of others in all kinds of ways, because they care about this beautiful world they will be leaving soon, and its vulnerable humankind. These elders need to be recognized for the grace of their intentions and actions.Leslie CurchackPetaluma, Calif.To the Editor:When I was a child, my mom insisted that I phone my great-grandmother Meme every Sunday, a task that I sometimes dreaded when I wanted to be playing games or watching TV. Over the years, I’ve realized the gift that my mom gave me with those phone calls and the relationship I built with Meme.As my grandparents age, I see the importance and necessity of seeing, listening to and honoring them. If given the opportunity, I would spend my days sitting in their living room or picking crabs on their porch.These are the opportunities we need to give young people: to build lasting relationships with older generations, to provide resources and information on how to care for them, and to show the simple power of picking up the phone and saying hello.Mary Alyson LynchBaltimoreTo the Editor:How stupid and/or prejudiced are we? We need young workers because of our aging population, and we have a reservoir of people who are exactly what we need. But we try to keep them out.I want to make a sign that says in Spanish, “Welcome to the U.S., and thank you for paying for my Social Security,” and hold it up at a border crossing. We need a rational immigration policy that screens Latinos to admit young people and/or professionals.Hardworking? Willing to take jobs that no one else wants to do? Ask anybody who employs Latinos about that.John M. FoggWilmington, N.C.To the Editor:As a mother (age 89) and daughter (58) who have frequent and lively conversations about the way our culture represents and treats the elderly, we were pleased to read the special section “Can America Age Gracefully?”Our discussion prompted a challenge for our favorite paper, however: How about starting a regular column about aging written by different people from the elderly demographic, especially from its upper end?While we applaud the insightful angles and significant issues treated in these pieces, we couldn’t help but notice that no article author was old. Rather than merely interviewing a few subjects, why not center this important and largely missing voice?As one article notes, many seniors say they feel invisible, and a forum in a significant newspaper would be a small step toward countering the vastly underacknowledged bias of ageism. Participant-observers in the late stage of life can offer unique field notes and analyses of their lived experiences, from which we would all benefit. Here’s to the Vox Senectutis!Anne E. MarshallNancy Rose MarshallTo the Editor:Thank you for “Can America Age Gracefully?” and for tackling a traditionally unpopular subject. In this country we have a certain amount of denial and misunderstanding about aging that, unfortunately, helps no one.What does help a person age gracefully? I would say common sense, good family relationships and a realistic attitude toward the subject. We are not going to live forever, and dealing with that concept can be difficult indeed.I am a retired gerontologist, and was delighted to teach the subject at one of our local universities. I will never forget the plaintive plea of a student: “I just want to learn how to talk to my grandma.” I suggested gently that he might listen to her first.Julie BartonSaratoga, Calif.To the Editor:Here’s my story: I’m 71 years old. Last year I sold my house, car and everything I owned. I took the money and moved to Italy to pursue my love for ballroom dancing.I’m an amateur ballroom dancer. In the past year I’ve competed with my professional partner (who is 32 years old) in Rome, Portofino, Paris and Blackpool, England.
