Even 41 percent of Republicans supporting other candidates think Trump would be strongest.In Iowa, belief in Trump's electability, despite the criminal charges, has been ticking up. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans say Trump can win, up from 65 percent in October.What is DeSantis supposed to do with this? He's still saying he will win and Trump won't, especially if the former president is convicted. But electability is a hard card to play when the Florida governor is trailing Trump by nearly 50 points nationally and he's matching up more poorly against Biden. Even if DeSantis is right, there's no way to convince any Republican of that when the polling from media outlets hostile to Trump shows him consistently ahead.Nikki Haley looks strongest of all against Biden in the polling, but for Republicans the threshold question is whether Trump can win. As long as they think he can, a few extra points for another candidate is unlikely to sway them one way or the other.The ideal scenario for Democrats is that Biden's weakness is illusory, and Republicans blithely nominate Trump based on the current polling only to be shocked to learn he isn't as strong against Biden as advertised next fall.This is plausible, but there's every possibility that Biden's political standing is as bad as it seems and he's on his way to not just helping Trump get the Republican nomination, but paving his way back to the White House.It's axiomatic among Republicans that Trump is fortunate in his enemies. Biden may be the best proof yet."
