In her own sermon, Rabbi Timoner offered strong criticism of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his policies and his allies. She calls the Israeli occupation and displacement of Palestinians \"shameful\" and deserving of \"full atonement.\"She supports allowing humanitarian assistance to the civilians of Gaza and agrees that the Israeli military must do everything possible to limit non-combatant casualties and save the hostages. She calls for a post-war plan that includes Israeli support for rebuilding Gaza and insisting on the creation of two states.Timoner's comments critiquing the left, however, should not be confused with the political efforts of conservatives who are capitalizing on antisemitic incidents to fuel a broader narrative  - one that they have been promoting for years - about American universities being an incubator forleftist radicalism.Not only have many of these claims been based onmisleading and inflated examplesbut the right's own standing on this issue lacks credibility, given the rise of extremists and nationalist groups on the far-right that have spouted antisemitic rhetoric. In 2017, the nation witnessed far-right groups at the Unite the Right rally shouting \"Jews will not replace us,\" before the deadly violence broke out inCharlottesville, Virginia, for example. And among those who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, one rioter had on a sweatshirt with \"Camp Auschwitz\" emblazoned on it.The rise of conspiracy theories has also propelledantisemitic myths, while high-level Republican officials, including former PresidentDonald Trump, have been accused of trafficking in antisemitic tropes, giving newfound legitimacy to these ideas in mainstream politics.More recently, CNN'sJake Tapperslammed Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene after she introduced a censure resolution against Michigan Democrat Rep.Rashida Tlaib over her criticism of Israel. He said, \"The degree to which some folks only pretend to care about antisemitism when they can weaponize it never ceases to amaze me ... This is the same Marjorie Taylor Greene who has pushed the great replacement theory in videos. The deranged notion that rich Jews are trying to replace White Americans and Westerners with Blacks and brown Muslims.\"Notwithstanding the hypocrisy and cynical moves by the right, progressives must, as Timoner rightly argues, respond to the antisemitism in their midst. A political movement committed to human rights can only preserve its legitimacy by rejecting such reactionary sentiment.Antisemitism is fundamentally antithetical to the progressive movement. Now is the time for those on the left to be crystal clear that social hatred, discrimination and violence toward Jews will not be tolerated within their own ranks. Should those on the left allow these ideas to fester, they will cause enormous long-term damage to the progressive agenda that so many have fought so hard to promote for decades. As the Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel once wrote, \"Some are guilty, but all are responsible.\"Opinion By Julian Zelizer, CNNTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
