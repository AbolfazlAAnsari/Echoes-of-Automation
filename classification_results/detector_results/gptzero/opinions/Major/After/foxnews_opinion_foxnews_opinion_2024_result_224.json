Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are also backed by Iran, struck an apartment building in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv on Friday with a drone, killing a man andprompting Israel to retaliatewith airstrikes against gas and oil depots and a power station at a port in Yemen.Even more alarmingly, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that Iran will be able to produce enough nuclear material in as little as a week or two to build an atomic bomb.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONNetanyahu is likely to call on the U.S. and Arab nations to work in partnership with Israel in their mutual self-interest to contain Iran with crippling economic sanctions and a credible threat of a military response to Iranian use of force.A Palestinian state would giveIran and its client terrorist groupsan additional base to threaten not just Israel, but America’s Arab allies and U.S. forces in the Middle East, and would allow terrorists to add to the devastation they have inflicted on Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen.It is unfortunate that Israel gets less support from Americans today than it did in years past because of propaganda successfully spread by those who hate Israel and Jews. I realize Netanyahu can’t instantly reverse this with one speech, but I hope he can make a strong case for why both Democratic and Republican officials and the American people should stand in solidarity with Israel and in opposition to its terrorist enemies and Iran.\\A resurgent Hamas ruling Gaza would inevitably lead to more suffering and death on the part of Palestinians as well as Israelis. The group must not be allowed to return to power.Rewarding Hamas, Hezbollah and others with thetype of Palestinian state demandedby Palestinian leadership and hand-wringing diplomats at the United Nations and elsewhere would benefit no one except bloodthirsty terrorists who callously sacrifice Palestinian lives on the altar of their hatred for Jews and the Jewish state.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JASON GREENBLATTJason D.
