Martin Cullip of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance's Consumer Center explains that the anti-tobacco gang at the WHO are very impressed with countries that erect high barriers to tobacco use, including smoking bans, high taxes, age restrictions and so on. Panama's legislators having followed this path, Panama was rewarded with the conference. Delegates have flooded in from around the world to support hotels, restaurants and the economy at large. After a day of listening to prohibitionists preach the evils of nicotine many presumably head off to sip margaritas and pinot noirs - though alcohol, a known carcinogen, is a much greater hazard than smokeless tobacco.But here's the thing: Panama has been so successful in its anti-tobacco and anti-nicotine policies that the illegal nicotine market now accounts for the lion's share of the total cigarette market. Cullip estimates that 90 per cent of trade is illegal. Imagine the foregone tax revenues! The city of Colon at the Atlantic end of the Panama Canal has become a South American distribution node for illegal cigarettes from China.The WHO wants a future of zero nicotine - not zero tobacco, though burning tobacco is where the real health danger lies. Some forms of nicotine contain less than one per cent the toxins cigarettes do, but in the WHO's view, all nicotine needs to be controlled and medicalized, thus creating well-paid government jobs and further empowering the medical profession.Conference discussion papers excoriate any low-risk products and recommend that e-cigarettes, heat-not-burn tobacco and modern oral products such as Zyn and Zonnic be treated as if they had the same risk as smoking. Yet Public Health England and the Royal College of Physicians have been telling us for two decades that low-risk products are a valuable off-ramp for smokers. And two former WHO leaders have just published the same message in the Lancet, effectively jumping ship.In contrast, tobacco-quitting aids produced by Big Pharma are just fine with the WHO - which may not be so surprising given the industry's many grants to medical researchers. Canada's small vaping businesses, who produce legal low-risk products and pay their taxes, are not so lucky. The WHO wants to eliminate them. Any person or group advocating nicotine is an infidel in its view.Here at home, Health Canada and Johnson &; Johnson have both have been platinum-level supporters of Canadian Public Health Association conferences on tobacco. That is the same J&;J that recently paid out about US$10 billion in the opioids scandal and another $10 billion in the talc scandal. The good doctors and other health professionals who run the CPHA evidently see no conflict of interest there. And the platinum sponsors themselves are apparently fine with the conferences' slant on vaping -people who represent or work with producers of reduced-harm products are simply not welcome. Your tax dollars help suppress the freedom of dissidents even to listen to what the CPHA presents as science.It's not that there are no smart people at Health Canada. But they cave to pressure. Advocacy groups with \"cancer,\" \"lung,\" \"stroke,\" \"heart\" or \"smoke-free\" in their names bully the timid bureaucrats. Health Canada admits on its website that vaping is much less harmful than smoking - which it is, by a factor of 20. But it washes its hands of any responsibility to inform Canada's four million smokers that e-cigarettes are the most successful quitting device since Sir Walter Raleigh first coughed. Our legislators are equally anal. The Tobacco and Vaping Products Act of 2018 prevents vape shops from informing their customers of the relative risks of different products - though these risks are recognized on Health Canada's website.Next week, our 15 delegates will return from their Panama travails, having heard endless prohibitionist catechism and supported motions about the evil of everything the WHO opposes. They will have participated in discussion groups and may even have contributed their thoughts. I would love to know what their value added will have been.The Libertarian's dilemma: How to make free people smarter?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/libertarians-dilemma-how-make-free-people-smarter)Reconciliation through Indigenous financial institutions(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-facilitate-real-reconciliation-through-indigenous-financial-institutions)Canada's Eagle Pass symbolizes unity; America's exemplifies crisis(https://financialpost.com/opinion/canada-eagle-pass-symbolizes-unity-america-exemplifies-crisis)If, as a taxpayer, you would like to know if your dollars were well spent, email Health Canada and ask whether Canada fought for the right of individuals to consume products that are much less harmful than alcohol or if instead we were bullied into supporting policies we know are contrary to the interests of millions of Canadians who seek a low-risk route to a drug that helps them fight depression, anxiety and even dementia.Ian Irvine, professor of economics at Concordia University, has worked on smoking and alcohol for the federal government.
