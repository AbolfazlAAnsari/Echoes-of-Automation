She told us that she couldn’t give it to him, that the Barbie was only for girls.The next day we bought him one.Nancy LubarskyCranford, N.J.To the Editor:I wasn’t allowed to play with Barbies as a kid, yet I saw the film wearing sparkly pink heels and a hot pink dress, excited to have a girls’ night out. I just didn’t expect to be weeping so hard I had to use my sunglasses case as a tissue.I was absolutely blown away by the giant everything of the film. “Barbie” was wildly imaginative, shockingly poignant, and brilliant in its expansive scope and execution.What surprised me the most was how much Mattel let the director, Greta Gerwig, take the wheel. It was a movie that looked unlike anything I’ve ever seen, tackling women’s roles with deft precision, heart and inventive humor.Brava, Greta!Heather Hach HearneManhattan Beach, Calif.To the Editor:Boy, is Barbie getting a lot of coverage (full disclosure: I owned two in the 1960s).In my view, “Barbie” the movie, and the concomitant buzz around the whole Barbie phenomenon, are a sobering reflection on how fake, plastic, artificial, vapid and shallow we have become as a society.People, these dolls and accessories are for prepubescent girls, and not worthy of your attention, except to engender serious discussion about the sad series of events in America for the last 30 to 40 years that has led us to this point.Sheila ReillyJamestown, R.I.Should Madison Square Garden Be Saved?To the Editor:Re “A Horizon of Hope at Penn Station” (Critic’s Notebook, July 10):Michael Kimmelman suggests that the public should rally around a proposal by ASTM North America to continue operating Penn Station under Madison Square Garden. Its proposal is greatly preferable to the one submitted by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, but is still a steep compromise. Madison Square Garden needs to move.Even the M.T.A. has said that Madison Square Garden is incompatible with the functions of Penn Station. Indeed, the columns and piers that support Madison Square Garden impede critical improvements that Penn Station needs, especially at track level. Penn Station’s 1910 track plan needs to be modernized to accommodate regional rail now, not in the 22nd century.To continue Madison Square Garden above Penn Station would mean that the most expensive civic project for the largest transit hub in the hemisphere is effectively hostage to Madison Square Garden.Gov. Kathy Hochul needs to do more than improve the status quo incrementally and should instead give us a transit plan for the 21st century and beyond and the aboveground station that the public deserves.Samuel A. TurveyNew YorkThe writer is chair of ReThinkNYC.To the Editor:It is shameful that McKim, Mead &amp; White’s grand architectural masterpiece, the original Penn Station, was the structure demolished in order to build Madison Square Garden in the 1960s. But six decades later, I see the historical value of the arena, a site of many memorable events that has existed even longer than the original Penn Station.Madison Square Garden is by far the National Basketball Association’s oldest venue — and as a testament to its iconic status, the only one that does not bear a corporate name.Because of its Midtown Manhattan location, it is more accessible by foot, subway, bus or rail than the metropolitan area’s other large event spaces.Hopefully we can find a way to have a beautiful and better functioning Penn Station coexisting with Madison Square Garden. The new proposal outlined in this article is promising.Jeffrey B. FreedmanNew YorkA Path for UkraineTo the Editor:Re “What I Learned in Ukraine,” by Bret Stephens (column, July 24):With the Ukraine war past its 500th day, it is long overdue for the Biden administration to focus on the painful truth that a negotiated settlement is only going to happen based on battlefield results.This is the time for the United States, Britain and their European allies to stand firm and provide unwavering support so Kyiv avoids a stalemate and wins. The key is having the political will to act decisively now before the U.S. gets even deeper into the 2024 election cycle.Vladimir Putin shows no serious desire to compromise. Defeating the Russian military is the only viable path forward for serious diplomacy producing long-term stability and security in Europe. It’s the only option that ensures a democratic Ukraine and holds Russia accountable.That’s a clear win for America and its European allies, not just for Ukraine.James L. RegensNichols Hills, Okla.The writer is founding director and Regents professor at the University of Oklahoma Center for Intelligence and National Security.This article appeared in print on page A23."
