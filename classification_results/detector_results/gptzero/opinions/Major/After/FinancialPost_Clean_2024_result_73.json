Canadian workers have never enjoyed the same level of investment as their U.S. counterparts, but over the past decade, the longstanding gap has widened to a chasm. In 2014, the typical U.S. worker got about C$20,700 of new investment support, while the typical Canadian worker got C$14,400 - about 70 cents per dollar that the U.S. worker enjoyed. By the fourth quarter of 2023, the typical U.S. worker was getting the equivalent of C$27,800 annually in new investment, while the typical Canadian worker got just $14,500 - only $100 more than in 2014, a huge decline in inflation-adjusted terms, and just 52 cents per dollar enjoyed by the average U.S. worker.Even worse, the Canada-U.S. gap is wider in the categories of investment we look to for innovation and better jobs in the future: machinery and equipment (M&;E) and intellectual property products (IPP), such as software. For every dollar of M&;E investment per U.S. worker at the end of 2023, the typical Canadian worker was getting only 41 cents. For every dollar of IPP investment per U.S. worker, the typical Canadian worker got a pathetic 29 cents.Not only are Canadian workers enjoying little, if any, improvement in their productivity and living standards, they are falling behind workers elsewhere - and especially workers in our closest neighbour, biggest trading partner, and most intense competitor. Our crisis of productivity and earnings is also a crisis of competitiveness.This federal budget is 'one of the worst in decades'(https://financialpost.com/opinion/chrystia-freeland-unaffordability-budget)Ben &; Jerry's woke chickens are coming home to roost(https://financialpost.com/opinion/ben-jerrys-woke-chickens-come-home-to-roost)In post-disaster rebuilding, government needs to get out of the way(https://financialpost.com/opinion/disaster-rebuilding-government-needs-to-get-out-of-the-way)The 2024 budget got one thing right. We have a problem. But it got just about everything else wrong. A decade of bloated spending increases, populist tax hikes and chronic borrowing has left Canadian workers less equipped than they were and Canadian households struggling to make ends meet. We need federal budgets that promise, and governments that deliver, leaner more efficient public services, growth-friendly tax reforms and lower debt. Instead of bemoaning our declining living standards, future such budgets might actually celebrate our success in raising them.Financial PostWilliam Robson is CEO of the C.D.
