Just because Republicans don't seem to know how to win over voters doesn't mean the GOP and the antiabortion movement don't know where to go next. They do.While GOP presidential candidates are facing tough questions about the electoral viability of their positions on abortion, plans are already in place to federalize the issue and ignore the will of voters. The beauty of these plans, for Republicans and for leaders in the antiabortion movement, is that they rely not on voters but on a 2024 victory for former President Donald Trump and the control of the Supreme Court that his first term already guaranteed.The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 a presidential transition plan vetted and crafted by more than 70 conservative and pro-life groups, details an abortion policy focused almost entirely on the operations of theDepartment of Justice in a second Trump term.

The reinvention of Comstock is tailormade for this conservative majority, which identifies withtextualism, a method of interpretation centered on what is said to be the plain meaning of a statute.Other GOP strategies rely on the Supreme Court and control over red states legislatures. Not every state has a mechanism forvoter-initiated ballot measures. Others, like South Carolina, cut voters out of the process of selecting and reconfirmingstate Supreme Court judges. So in states like Tennessee or South Carolina, it may not matter what voters think about abortion unless they are willing to elect a democratic legislative majority-no mean feat in gerrymandered conservative states, even those,like Florida or Georgia, that should be politically competitive.Conservative states cannot only honor the wishes of abortion opponents but also try to project their power outside of state borders. Conservative attorneys general in states fromTexastoAlabamatoIdahohave claimed the authority to prosecute people for aiding women to travel to states where abortion is protected. Idaho has passed a law allowing for prosecutions for people who help minors travel for abortionwithout parental consent.Controlling red state legislatures affords abortion opponents a chance to experiment with these potentially laws, which might violate the right to travel and the Full Faith and Credit Clause, which requires states to honor judgments and statutes from other states. These experiments seem worth trying for the same reason that Republicans wish to resurrect the Comstock Act: Trump stacked the federal courtswith conservative judgeswho might be open to novel and potentially unconstitutional enforcement strategies.And then there are abortion pills.

A Trump FDA could entertain new restrictions on mifepristone or even revisit its approval.There is a final linchpin to Republicans' abortion plans: the 2024 presidential election. Polls show President Joe Bidentrailing Trumpin almost every battleground state despite the latter's ever-growing list of criminal charges. Voters clearly care about abortion, but unlike in ballot initiative or state races, many might believe that another Biden term won't make a difference.It's true that a second Biden term probably won't lead to passage of a federal statute protecting abortion or restore Roe v. Wade. But what Republicans are banking on is that voters will believe that a second Trump term won't further dismantle abortion rights - either because Trump has backed away from the antiabortion movement, or because the president would need Congress to introduce a meaningful ban.The Project 2025 plan shows that many abortion opponents believe both of those assumptions are wrong. They think that Trump, once in office, will try to deliver for the social conservatives who have always been his most ardent supporters. And they believe that he will not need voters to do it as long as he has the keys to the White House and the support of the conservatives on the Supreme Court.So as the dust settles after the 2023 election, Democrats may have won the first battle for the hearts and minds of voters when it comes to abortion, but if Trump wins a second term, abortion opponents feel confident they will win the war.Opinion by Mary ZieglerTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
