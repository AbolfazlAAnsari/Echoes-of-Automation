Viewmore opinionon CNN.US military forces once again confronted aggressive, potentially deadly moves by Iran-allied militias in the Middle East over the weekend. It's further evidence that American efforts to deter these militias' dangerous, persistent belligerence are simply not working. The message to Iran is not getting through.On Sunday,explosions rocked the Red Sea¸ the narrow but pivotal body of water that connects Europe to the Middle East and Asia. Yemen's Houthi militias, closely allied with Iran, werefiring missilesat commercial vessels and possibly at US naval ships, so theUnited States fired back, shooting down drones, repeating a now familiar but increasingly perilous cycle that threatens to escalate with potentially ominous consequences.The USS Carney responded amid a series of four attacks by the Houthis, according to US Central Command. Most of the militia's targets were civilian cargo ships, but, worryingly, at least one armed drone was \"headed toward Carneyalthough its specific target is not clear,\" the US statement said.The continuing attacks by militias allied with Iran and itsIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, targeting US forces across the Middle East along withcivilian vessels, are posing an untenable dilemma for the Biden administration.The White House wisely wants to prevent the war between Israel and Hamas - like the Houthis a member of Iran's \"axis of resistance\" - from expanding into a regional conflict. But Iran's proxies are relentlessly taunting the Americans. Iran's partners have launched at least76 separate attacksagainst US forces in Syria and Iraq since mid-October, a defense official told CNN. They attack American targets almost daily.The Biden administration is trying to modulate its response, hitting back hard enough to deter Iran with multiple strikes against a variety of targets -killing Iran-backed militiamembers in Iraq this weekend, strikingIRGC weapons depotsin Syria,warning Hezbollahin Lebanon to think twice before jumping in - but not so hard that it falls into the trap ofgetting involved in another war, which neither President Joe Biden nor any responsible person in America wants.Iran knows that.Some Republicansare criticalof the Biden administration for not doing more to prevent the attacks by the Houthis and other Iran proxies. Former Defense SecretaryLeon Panetta, a Democrat, recently urged a more aggressive approach as well.As Israel and Hamas battle each other, Iran is showcasing its defiance, trying to flex its muscle, highlighting its geographic reach across several Mideast countries, perhaps seeking to intimidate other regional rivals, along with Israel and even the United States. By keeping its own uniformed fighters largely out of the fray, Tehran has plausible deniability about its involvement in the attacks.Few are fooled. Central Command's statement on Sunday declared that the US believes the Houthi attacks \"are fully enabled by Iran.\"For the Houthis, these violent expressions of solidarity with Hamas constitute an opportunity to burnish their standing among the Arab and Muslim publics, who are siding strongly with the Palestinians.Whatever the motivation, the continuing attacks, and the escalating threats to civil navigation cannot be allowed to stand.One of the most urgent items on the agenda is stabilizing conditions on the Red Sea. Look at a map.The Red Seais the channel that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the rest of the Middle East and Asia. Any commerce between China, India or other Asian countries with Europe or the US East Coast has to pass through the Suez Canal that links the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The Houthis pose a grave threat to international commerce and the global economy, not to mention regional stability.The US and NATO should assertively defend freedom of navigation. TheHouthis, an Iran-armed organization, needs to be confronted before a disaster at sea sends shockwaves of disruption across the global economy.In the first place, Houthis must be designated as a terrorist organization once again.Last month, the Biden administration revealed that it is reviewing \"potential terrorist designations\" for the Shia extremist group. Already members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, are urging the administration to do just that.The move would confirm the shift in the administration's geopolitical stance and the waning influence on Biden's foreign policy by progressive forces within the Democratic Party.In February 2021, just a month after Biden's inauguration, one of the first acts of Secretary of State Antony Blinken waslifting the Houthis' designationas a terrorist group.The decision was remarkable because the State Department's announcement confirmed that the Houthis are, in fact, terrorists, noting that the group formally known as Ansarallah, was \"kidnappingandtorturing citizens of the United Statesand many of our allies, diverting humanitarian aid, brutally repressing Yemenis.\"Still, the war between the Houthi rebels and the government they sought to unseat in Yemen, backed by a coalition led by Saudi Arabia, had become a major humanitarian catastrophe. Progressive figures argued that lifting the terrorist designation - regardless of its accuracy -would save lives.In those days, the Biden administration was trying to cool relations with Saudi Arabia, a plan that later alsowent into reverse.That the Houthis are terrorists is beyond dispute. They have imprisoned and tortured countless Yemenites and foreigners. Human rights organizations have thoroughly documented their violations. They have crushed women's rights,imprisoning and torturing women, prompting critics to suggest Yemen is headed in Afghanistan's Taliban direction. They've gone after journalists, sentencing them to death beforesubjecting them to torture, androutinely abusingother civilians whileblocking humanitarian assistancefrom reaching them.Their insurgency rose out of the remote Saada governorate of Yemen, where the ethnic Houthis practiceZaidi Shia Islam. The Houthis accused the government of then-PresidentAli Abdullah Salehof corruption and of being too close to Saudi Arabia and the United States.Supported, armed and trained by Iran, they adopted the very revealinganti-American and antisemiticslogan, \"God is greatest (Allahu Akbar), death to America, death to Israel, cursed be the Jews, victory to Islam.\"The Houthis say their attacks will continue until Israel stops its campaign in Gaza. But, like Hamas, Iran, Hezbollah and other members of the so-called axis of resistance, they oppose any permanent reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians and support Israel's destruction.Since the October 7 Hamas massacre of Israelis that triggered the current war, the Houthis have seized aJapan-chartered cargo ship, and they have targeteda UK-owned and operated vessel, among others. They also fired ballistic missiles toward theUSS Masonas the American Navy ship responded to a distress call from another civilian ship under attack.In addition, theHouthis have launched guided missilestoward Israeli cities.AmericanandIsraeli defensive weaponshave shot those down, but these moves raise the troubling question of what would ensue if a Yemeni missile hit an Israeli city.Formally designating the Houthis a terrorist organization would provide moral clarity and prevent the Houthis from using US financial institutions and other facilities, and it would be unlikely to have negative humanitarian repercussions.The brutal civil war that plunged Yemen's civilians into a catastropheis winding downafter a 2022 ceasefire. Like other Iran-linked militias, the Houthis remain a source of instability, propelled by an uncompromising and repressive ideology.Their actions, and those of other militias that are repeatedly attacking US forces require a more forceful response. The United States needs to continue calibrating its pushback carefully, but the current level is not sending the necessary message that the attacks must stop.Opinion by Frida GhitisTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
