Now, they're pointing to 2023's statistics to absolve themselves of blame, arguing conservatives made up a \"crime crisis\" narrative. This isn't just a dishonest argument but exemplifies a new depth in Democrat deflection. It ends up proving that Democrats have blood on their hands.After reaching a record-high number of homicides in Democrat-run cities across the country, 2023 experienced about 13% fewer than the previous year. ABC News framed the statistic around public polling that shows Americans aredeeply concerned with crime. Citing a recent Gallup poll, crime analyst Jeff Asher told ABC News, \"Seventy-something percent of Americans believe crime is rising this year. And seventy-something percent of Americans in this case just happen to be wrong.\"New York-based journalist Ahmed Baba used the ABC News piece to pretend fears about crime are unfounded, claiming there’s a \"stark disconnect between how a lot of Americans feel and what’s actually happening. Disinformation is distorting our perception of reality.\"He said the disconnect was a result of \"overt disinfo from right-wing orgs like Fox News,\" and posited that \"when crime stories are spotlighted in MSM [mainstream media], people assume crime is high.\" Similarly, Axios claimed Republican criticisms of Democrats on crime was \"crumbling\", while U.S. politics columnist for the Guardian, Chris Stein, lazily used misleading data to suggest the same.NBC NEWS STORY TELLS AMERICANS THEY’RE ‘WRONG’ TO THINK CRIME IS RISING, BLAMES ‘CONDITIONING’ OF PRESSBut crimeishigh and we aren’t wrong to feel concerned. We’re simply looking at our cities the way we’re supposed to.As I explain in my book, \"What’s Killing America: Inside the Radical Left’s Tragic Destruction of Our Cities,\" context is key to understanding crime statistics. We’re seeing fewer homicides when compared to ahistoricallyhigh number of murders between 2020 and 2022. That detail is important.Jason Rantz's new book \"What's Killing America\"Surveys reveal that American concerns about high crime rates persist, primarily because current figures remain elevated compared to the pre-COVID era. During that time, law enforcement was fully funded and had broader operational latitude. And we can’t forget that in a bid to deflect responsibility for the crime surge, a consequence of theirdefund police strategy, Democrats originally blamed the uptick in criminal activity to COVID. Therefore, it is logical to look towards 2018 and 2019 as benchmark years for a more accurate comparison of crime rates. And the numbers are less impressive when you do that.VIDEO ALLEGEDLY SHOWS DC TEENS WEIGHING CHARGES OF CRIMES THEY PLANNED ON COMMITTINGAnnual homicides in Denver were down 4% in 2023 (with 72). But it’s still 14% higher thanwhatit was in 2019 (63). Likewise, homicides in Albuquerque saw a 21% dip in 2023 (95). Yet residents know that’s still 86% higher than in 2018 (51). At the same time, with such a dramatic rise in property crimes during an inflation crisis, a broken car window, stolen catalytic converter, or ransacked garage, is felt more harshly and rightly elicit a more substantial emotional reaction that crime is out of control.Yet it’s hard to imagine record high homicides continuing forever, particularly since many of the cities hit the hardest started to reverse their Radical Left approach to the criminal justice system. Even when viewed through a lens favorable to Democrats, as ABC News attempted, the data paints a damning picture of their policies. It's a telling indictment that, despite efforts to spin the narrative, the negative consequences of these policies are too glaring to ignore.New Orleans had the highest big-city homicide rate in 2022 in the country at 65% from 2019 to 2020.Philadelphia's ratejumped by almost 50%, and Atlanta's climbed by 75%. These cities had a lot in common: they were run by Democrats who embraced the defund movement.The Black Lives Matter-inspired agenda goes beyond just the literal slashing of police budgets. This movement had been instrumental in championing extreme criminal justice reforms like those that favor restorative justice programs over jail time for repeat offenders, the refusal to prosecute on specific crimes, severe restrictions on police pursuits, and the elimination or limitation of cash bail.The Radical Left even leveraged theCOVID pandemicas a pretext to empty prisons and prosecutors turning a blind eye to charging criminals. This fostered a rampant culture of lawlessness that has spilled over from the cities and states enacting these reckless reforms, affecting communities far and wide.The quicker those cities abandoned the Radical Left reforms, the better they recovered in 2023.New Orleans invested in technology, likedrones, to make policing easier and safer. Philadelphia refunded its police department, with mayoral candidates in 2022condemningthe defund movement. Atlanta increased police staffing and used data to determine which neighborhoods to sendmoreofficers to.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONAfter murders surged by 43% in 2022 compared to 2021, the San Antonio Police Department delivered a \"very simple strategy.\" The department tracked the neighborhoods with the most 911 calls for violent crimes, and sent officers to proactively police -- the precise opposite of what Radical Left activists demanded after Floyd.In some cases, the department would park an officer in a patrol vehicle with its emergency lights on to remind people that officers are there to intervene if necessary. The chief called it \"a high visibility, hot-spot policing effort.\" It worked. The homicide rate dropped by about 12%.To be clear, the picture isn’t bright everywhere.Seattle saw a historic number of homicides in 2023, whileWashington, D.C. numbers rose 36%. There have also been suspicions that some cities, like Philadelphia, are cooking the books by misleadingly characterizing homicides as something else. We’ve also seen an alarming explosion of juvenile-led violent crimes from coast to coast that threatens to become untenable.Still, it turns out that allowing police officers to actually do their jobs is effective in reducing crime. Who would've thought, right? Democrats, of course, are loath to acknowledge that their policies are at the root of the crime crisis.Yet, it's clear as day: distancing from the Radical Left’s influence on the criminal justice system has demonstrably enhanced our safety.Themainstream mediashould not give Democrats or their mouthpieces a free pass on this issue. If these networks refuse to frame the narrative accurately, it's up to us to spread the truth. There's still a mountain of work ahead to dismantle Radical Left policies if we aim to return to the low crime rates of the pre-COVID era.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JASON RANTZJason Rantz, author of \"What’s Killing America: Inside the Radical Left’s Tragic Destruction of Our Cities,\" is a Seattle-based talk show host on KTTH Radio.
