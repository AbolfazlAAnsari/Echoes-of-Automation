Please send your letters toletters@independent.co.ukI seethe good people of Wellingboroughdecided that enough was enough and voted accordingly.In all my years, I cannot think of a more ludicrous choice than the last Tory to hold the seat, Peter Bone. His partner and most recent candidate Helen Harrison only amplified this by allowing the disgraced former MP to assist in campaigning around the Northamptonshire market town!Maybe, as a side grift, someone at Tory HQ could write a book titled: How one can guarantee a by-election loss (for dummies)?Robert BostonKingshill, KentI’ve been a floating voter for 40 years and have never seen real changeIn 40 years as a floating voter, real change has never happened. Greed is responsible for all our problems as it breeds resentment, inequality, poverty and anger – yet no party has ever attempted to tackle it, so the same problems in society remain.Despite a financial model that has led to recession after recession, whoever is in power still ploughs the same road. But as we flip only between the same two failed parties, we – as the public – get what we deserve... which is the same old, same old.So, when Labour win the next election, I’m certain all the foreign newspapers will be reporting it as “far-left party take power in the UK” – in the way we report on foreign elections. No doubt, in five years’ time we will once again be voting for a change that will never occur.Richard WhitesideHalifaxFancy a joke at Liz Truss’s expense?The two by-election defeats are bound to result in further attacks on Rishi Sunak’s premiership from factions within his party, includingLiz Truss’s Popular Conservatives.A recently received joke (possibly unfairly) made me think of her and the extensive use she makes of social media to promote herself. It read: “I don’t know if Facebook has ever caused the lame to walk – but it has sure caused the dumb to speak.”Roger HindsSurreyThe nation deserves betterThe by-election results, recent events, controversies, PMQs and the general ongoing performance of both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition have given a real taste of how dispiriting the forthcoming election campaign is going to be.Both Sunak and Keir Starmer are happy to play the old partisan games. It is so dire and dispiriting. It is not the sort of leadership to uplift the nation or kindle a flame in its heart.The nation is yearning for some hope and vision, for sincerity and honesty, for national healing and renewal. There is, though, sadly no real engagement and the arrogance and condescension being shown towards the electorate is immense.It would be a delight and relief if the debate could take a turn for the better and become a genuine exploration of what is wrong and what is possible. Less tribalism and more respect and genuine engagement with each other would be a good start. The nation is frustrated and wants and deserves better.Stewart LuckCork, IrelandHere is Rishi’s real plan...1. Rishi’s recession. 2. Record run of reduced GDP per capita, negative since 2022. 3. Record levels of taxation. 4. Record by-election losses in a parliamentary term (ten). 5. All public services on their knees. 6. Failed to stop the boats. Rwanda plan is a farce. 7. Fined for breaking the law when chancellor. Law breaking! 8. Failed to apologise for insulting Brianna Ghey and her parents. Disgrace! 9. Failed to discipline James Cleverly for his outrageous date-rape drug comments. Disgrace!Yes: that’s Sunak’s roll of dishonour, his “plan of disgrace”. He says “Stick with the plan, it’s working” ... yet even his Conservative colleagues now openly question Sunak’s flawed logic.Both the country and the electorate are on their knees, Sunak’s so-called plan has failed, as has his weak leadership. How long does the party want this tragedy to continue? It has become fatally cringeworthy and terminal now.Dale HughesAddress suppliedWe must protect the future of NHS breast screening programmesThe week of 19-25 February 2024 is the World Cancer Research Fund’s Cancer Prevention Action Week, an event encouraging greater awareness of cancer and cancer prevention around the globe.Here in the UK, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, affecting over 55,000 women a year and growing in numbers all the time. Over 10,000 of these women are under the age of 50, when regular mammogram screening typically begins.It’s imperative that we take action to protect the future of the NHS breast screening programme if we are to seriously tackle the vast numbers of diagnoses every year. Yet we are facing a significant workforce challenge that could stop the mammogram programme in its tracks: 38 per cent of breast radiologists and 49 per cent of breast clinicians are set to retire by 2025. Over 10 per cent of breast radiologist and radiographic posts are vacant nationally.One answer lies in the creation of a National Breast Imaging Academy, which is planned to be built in Manchester and would train around 50 new staff a year to go on to fill positions across the UK. Our charity is actively fundraising to build this academy, but there is still a long way to go.If organisations and governments are truly serious about cancer prevention, then investing in practical, proactive solutions to an impending catastrophic issue impacting the country’s biggest cancer cannot be optional.Nikki BarracloughCEO, Prevent Breast Cancer"
