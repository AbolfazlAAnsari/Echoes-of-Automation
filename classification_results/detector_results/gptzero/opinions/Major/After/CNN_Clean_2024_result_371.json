They think that Sotomayor's health, and the possibility that Democrats might lose the presidency and the Senate in November, put the future of the court's liberal wing at risk.The worry is that the high court's 6-3 conservative majority could potentially become an emboldened 7-2 majority if former President Donald Trump were elected and filled a vacancy. These critics fear the scenario that played out with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. After resisting calls to retire, Ginsburgdiedin 2020, which allowed then-President Trump to appoint Justice Amy Coney Barrett.The push for Sotomayor to retire is misguided and deeply flawed. It ignores political reality and reflects ignorance of the lives of people with disabilities. The arrogance of those who want the country'sfirst Latina justiceto abdicate her position is exceeded only by their wishful thinking that she will listen to them.While praising Sotomayor as \"the greatest liberal to sit on the Supreme Court in my adult lifetime,\" The Guardian'sMehdi Hasan wonders, \"Why not retire now?\" The answer is becausethe Constitution, which Sotomayor took an oath to uphold, says that justices \"shall hold their offices during good behavior.\" Sotomayor's position is a lifetime appointment, not one to be cut short due to political vagaries.Columnist Josh Barrowritesthat Sotomayor's \"age problem can be dealt with very simply by her retiring.\" But by modern Supreme Court standards, Sotomayor is relatively young. Consider that Ginsburg served on the court for27 yearsand was afour-time cancer survivorbefore she passed away at 87. Justice John Paul Stevens was 90 when heretired in 2010. JusticeStephen Breyerstepped down in 2022, paving the way for the appointment of Ketanji Brown Jackson, but he was 83 when he did so.In contrast, Sotomayor is only 69. She has yet to reach theaverage life expectancyfor an American (76), foran American woman(79), or for a Hispanic woman (81). Sotomayor's mother lived to be 94.Even if Sotomayor stepped down tomorrow, there is no guarantee that President Joe Biden could successfully name her replacement. With Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) in the Senate, it's an open question as to whether Democrats have the votes to confirm a new justice, given that both are centrists with a history of bedeviling establishment leaders with their own agendas. Plus, it's doubtful that Biden would name a successor to Sotomayor who would be asstrong a championof marginalized people.Besides, people with type 1 diabetes can livelong and healthy lives, so long as they have reliable access to health care and medication. Sotomayor's condition, shared by singerNick Jonas,OlympiansandNFL players,is no reason for her to give up one of the influential posts in the nation.The fact that a few liberal pundits are so comfortable speculating about Sotomayor's medical issues is an insult to the 42 million Americansliving with disabilities. Her health is her own business. And aren't progressives usually the ones criticizing conservatives for making decisions about women's bodies?Urging Sotomayor's retirement, Hasan and Barro mention her type 1 diabetes, pointing to a report that she travels with a medic. Yet it has not been established that Sotomayor travels with a medic. TheHuffPost articlecited as a source for this claim states that the Marshals Service incurred costs for traveling with \"baggage (medic),\" while noting that this \"could refer to medical personnel or be a more benign reference to medical equipment in the justice's luggage.\"Some of these same liberal writers declare that it will be better for\"ordinary Latina women\"if Sotomayor retires, and that \"Latinasespecially, will suffer most\" with a more conservative court. No evidence is offered for these sweeping statements. In fact, the Latino community is home to bothconservativesand liberals, and Latinas can make up their own minds about what is good for them.True, in 2018 paramedics werecalled to Sotomayor's homewhen she had a low blood sugar episode. She was treated and then returned to work. But Chief Justice John Roberts washospitalized in 2020for a fall and suffered seizures in 1993 and 2007. Justice Clarence Thomasspent a weekin the hospital in 2022 for flu-like symptoms. They're still doing their jobs, and so can Sotomayor. In aJanuary public appearance, she described how the impact of the court keeps her going. \"I live in frustration. Every loss truly traumatizes me in my stomach and in my heart,\" she said. \"But I have to get up the next morning and keep on fighting.\"Justice Sotomayor does not serve in fealty to the interests of the Democratic Party. Her responsibility is to the law - and calls for her retirement are disrespectful and unwarranted.Opinion by Raul A. ReyesTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
