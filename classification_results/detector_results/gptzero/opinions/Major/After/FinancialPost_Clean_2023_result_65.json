Austrian economics favours competition and competition is the goal of the new rail policy.Many shippers in Canada find themselves located on or near the track of a single major railroad (their \"host\" railroad), with the track network of another major railroad some distance away. Shippers' rail access to this second railroad is controlled by their host so the potential for inter-rail competition is limited. Shippers wanting to access the second railroad somehow have to go through their host railroad.The two major Canadian railroads are interconnected at various track junctions known as switching points. In very dense trackage areas, the two will sometimes voluntarily move one another's traffic on their tracks, using switching points. This is known as \"inter-switching.\" A rail regulation known as \"extended inter-switching\" exists to support all Canadian shippers. The rail regulator (the Canadian Transportation Agency) can compel the shipper's host railroad to switch shipper traffic from its track onto another railroad via the nearest switching point. While routinely granted by the CTA when demanded by a shipper, extended inter-switching is limited to a 30 km radius. A shipper located beyond this distance cannot obtain extended inter-switching. Since 2017 a new regulation known as \"long-haul inter-switching\" has been available although the conditions governing it are burdensome enough that it has not actually been used yet.Extended inter-switching has led to policy controversy before. As part of its response to significant railroad service issues, in 2014 the Harper government allowed extended inter-switching over a radius of 160 km. By all shipper accounts this trial was successful, but the longer limit was ultimately lobbied away by the railroads and replaced in 2017 by the railroad-friendly policy of long-haul inter-switching.What data are available from the 2014-2017 trial suggest, first, that although the new policy did not lead to many actual inter-switches by 2017 rates for affected shipping groups were falling at least slightly while service was becoming more reliable and, second, that because it took time for shippers to learn the new regulations three years probably was not long enough for the market to reach a more-competitive equilibrium.The trial also showed that 160 km extended inter-switching neither overwhelmed rail capacity nor ruined the railroads but instead provided Canadian shippers some market contestability: the mere threat to exercise the extended inter-switch was enough to alter railway behaviour. Its re-implementation therefore gives shippers additional bargaining leverage in negotiating with railroads, which will need to offer improved service and rates if they want to retain market share.Mr. Dufort argued that U.S. railroads are \"rubbing their hands with glee\" at the prospect of extended inter-switching being imposed on their Canadian competitors. They almost certainly are not. In fact, the U.S. rail regulator is currently working to implement its own inter-switching policy (known as \"reciprocal switching\") to enhance competition. If U.S railroads are doing anything with their hands, it is waving goodbye to long-standing market power in many freight transportation markets.
