They are not racists or sick; they are not guilty of the crime that plagues the land ... they give lift to the American dream.\"Nixon carried this theme right to victory in November. His numbers would probably have been even greater had he not facedthird-party competition fromAlabama Gov. George Wallace, who joined him in blasting anti-war hippies.Many historians have come to agree that the intensity of the anti-war movement, which targeted Johnson(\"hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today\")as the architect of the conflict, ended up dampening support for Humphrey and opening a door for Nixon to win the White House.Biden and his campaign must surely be worried now that history will repeat itself.However, there are many important differences between 2024 and 1968 that could make this current situation significantly less damaging for Biden than some Democrats fear. Right now, the debates over the war are not centered on having American boots on the ground, as was the case with Vietnam. And while there are ongoing tensions among Democrats over how to tackle problems such as criminal justice reform, the party as a whole is much more aligned on these fault-line questions than they were in the 1960s, when the divisions within the party ran much deeper.The anti-war protests in the 1960s went on for years. Now, it remains unclear whether the protests - which are not yet nearly as large in scale or scope as were the anti-Vietnam protests - will continue to intensify or start to dissipate, especially as school lets out for the summer months. And in one recent Harvard Kennedypollsurveying young people between the ages of 18 and 29 in March, the findings showed the Israel/Palestine conflict ranked second-lowest in importance, coming in below gun violence as well as bread-and-butter issues such as inflation, health care and housing.Whereas the 1968 convention played out in an era of network television, where political conventions could command the attention of a much broader and diverse range of Americans, the media landscape of 2024 means that the convention will be seen, if at all, by a fragmented audience. Meanwhile, social media has also led to the rapid circulation of extraordinarily damaging videos and images of antisemitic rhetoric and acts within the campus protests.And, of course, the person who will attempt to win on the \"law and order\" theme in 2024 will have to do so in between multiple legal cases. While Trump called for a crackdown on protests in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd, he may have limited successin this case, given his multiplecriminal indictments(he has denied all wrongdoing) and the fact that his own presidency has come to embody disorder and chaos to many voters.Notwithstanding the differences that currently make these situations quite distinct, Democrats would do well to take the potential political threat seriously and to remain engaged with all the constituencies who are invested in this conflict before the critical months between August and early November.At a minimum, Biden can avoid the mistake Humphrey made, trying to simply ignore the fury that was raging underneath him, with the bandplaying\"Happy Days Are Here Again\"at the 1968 DNC convention to drown out the anti-war delegates.Opinion by Julian Zelizer, CNNTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
