He sided with McCarthy earlier this year by voting for a debt limit deal that the California Republican made with Biden. He's managed to win support from GOP pragmatists like Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) after promising that he would shepherd passage of must-do legislation including defense policy, agency budgets, and next year's reauthorization of food programs and farm subsidies.Previous GOP Speakers like Boehner and Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) came from the party's governing wing. Boehner worked with Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) to pass the No Child Left Behind education law in 2002; Ryan negotiated a 2013 budget accord with veteran Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and went on to chair the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.Jordan has nothing remotely similar on his résumé. Now he's hoping to get thrown in the deep end, taking on a Democratic president and a twin Senate threat of top Democrat Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who are allied against Jordan on aid to Ukraine and government spending levels. Jordan has vilified Schumer in the past and has virtually no history with McConnell.Conflict in the Middle East has further upended the equation. Biden is sending Congress a huge aid package request for both Israel and Ukraine; Jordan is a skeptic of Ukraine aid and his party is badly split on the question.A pessimistic take on Jordan is that he'd simply be unwilling to cut compromises with the Senate and the Biden White House, especially as the House slides toward a possible Biden impeachment. A partial government shutdown is in the offing if gridlock hits.For those seeking it, there's ample evidence in Jordan's past battles with leadership figures such as Boehner to suggest he won't play well with others now. Jordan helped drive Boehner from the speaker's chair in 2015. He and other Freedom Caucus figures gave Ryan fits during the first two years of the Trump administration, including a drawn-out battle over repealing Obamacare that almost led Ryan and Trump to abandon the idea. Instead, the repeal died in the Senate.When Boehner quit the speaker's chair he left himself time to \"clean out the barn\" - passing politically difficult bills like a debt limit increase before handing the gavel to Ryan.Now, the barn is a mess. Jordan wouldn't get the grace period afforded Ryan. Critical deadlines loom. Hard feelings permeate the competing leadership camps of Jordan and Majority Leader Steve Scalise. (Scalise bowed out of the speaker's race despite besting Jordan in a nominating ballot, complaining about bad faith from Jordan partisans.More than 20 Republicans, however, including several from the compromise-seeking Appropriations Committee, have united to block Jordan's path in two separate votes this week.Some of the pressure tactics employed by Jordan supporters irritated holdouts such as Appropriations Chair Kay Granger (R-Texas), a leadership loyalist whose opposition raised eyebrows. \"This was a vote of conscience and I stayed true to my principles,\" Granger wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \"Intimidation and threats will not change my position.\"McHenry may now end up cleaning out the barn, but it's clear Republicans would still be mistaken if they handed power to Jordan afterward."
