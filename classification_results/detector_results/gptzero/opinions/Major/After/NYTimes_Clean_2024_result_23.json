Also: Donald Trump’s followers; a citizen’s plea; slaughtering animals for food.To the Editor:Re “Don’t Ditch Standardized Tests. Fix Them,” by Jessica Grose (Opinion, nytimes.com, Jan. 17):Ms. Grose is incorrect when she says, “Without standardized testing, we won’t know where to put the most resources.” I taught in half a dozen schools in two of our nation’s largest school districts, and in my current job training teachers, I’ve been in dozens more. It takes about five minutes in a school building to know if it needs more resources.And yet, regardless of the ever-changing policy on standardized tests, the same schools across our nation suffer from underfunding year after year. The problem has never been that we don’t know where the gaps are. We simply remain unwilling to fund adequate schools for all our nation’s children.There may be curricular and pedagogical arguments in favor of testing, but to claim that such tests will finally get us to apportion funds to the schools that need them most is belied by our history. We need to change our mind-set about how we fund schools, not the quality of our measuring sticks.Jeremy GlazerGlassboro, N.J.The writer is an assistant professor of education at Rowan University.To the Editor:Jessica Grose doesn’t mention a standardized testing organization that many school districts around the nation use. NWEA,Northwest Evaluation Association, is a nonprofit organization that provides standardized tests in reading, math, language usage and science. Teachers like me use these three times each school year.Results are available immediately, and the two most relevant tests, reading and mathematics, take a total of about three hours to administer. The data these tests provide are fantastic. We use the results immediately to plan instruction.In Colorado, the tests required by our state consume two full weeks of learning time, and results are not available until the following school year.Todd LedermanEvergreen, Colo.To the Editor:Jessica Grose correctly highlights the value of testing from a statistical point of view: We need to know how poor students compare to rich ones, for example. Immediacy of feedback is also useful, which Ms. Grose details through her reference to “through-year assessment” in Texas and Florida, which replaces the old “one big test” model.No testing is perfect, though, and as a Florida parent and educator, I can report firsthand on the drawbacks of “through-year assessment.” Students experience this new approach as three big tests — that is, as more testing, not less — and feel stressed about testing throughout the year rather than just in the spring.Worse, children are tested on grade-level standards from the start: For example, a fourth grader will be tested on what they are supposed to know at the end of fourth grade just weeks into the fall. The result? Students often bomb the first test, which is on content they haven’t even been taught.It is unfair and damaging to them, making even the brightest students feel dumb and discouraged. It’s crushing to student morale, leaving parents to wipe away the tears of a child who feels like a failure. Whatever good testing is, this isn’t it.Peter WestmorelandSt. Petersburg, Fla.The writer is a professor of ethics at the Applied Ethics Institute, St. Petersburg College.To the Editor:Jessica Grose hints at an important point: We’re asking younger generations to adapt to the age-old standardized test rather than asking it to adapt to them. The pen-and-paper system can’t work well for those who spend most of their day on a screen.That’s why it may be time to use another system altogether: video games. I’ve played some engineered by employers to test critical thinking and evaluate an applicant’s strengths and weaknesses. These games adapted to my responses in real time and provided a more nuanced view of my value, which standardized tests can’t do. Games are also more fun and immersive, so it’s hard to get distracted during them.Serious innovation in standardized testing will be the best bet for future generations — and today we may have enough technology and frustration with the status quo to carry it through.Aman MajmudarChicagoThe writer is a senior at the University of Chicago.Trump’s Followers, Motivated by Fear and EnvyTo the Editor:Re “Too Much Bluster in Iowa” (column, Jan. 14):Maureen Dowd is puzzled about why Donald Trump’s “devoted fans don’t mind his mean streak.”She’s not alone. My theory is that for many Trump followers the devotion has its roots in a toxic mixture of repressed envy and adoration. He’s rich, his mouth is unfiltered, he unfailingly plays offense (even when he’s on the defense), and he presents himself as unaccountable to anyone or anything.That surely makes him an avatar to the kind of ordinary person who doesn’t have a shot at being extraordinary, but Mr. Trump, who defies norms, lets them dream.Magdalene RuzzaNew YorkTo the Editor:I read “MAGA Has Devoured American Evangelicalism,” by Michelle Goldberg (column, Jan. 13), and then later saw the movie “Mean Girls” … and I thought, “Wow, what a parallel!”Might those Trump followers be like the Plastics, who follow after the bully just to try to avoid getting bullied themselves? They have no respect for the bully and might even loathe the bully, but heaven forbid they should appear in the Burn Book (or vilified on Fox News).How refreshing it would be if our country could focus on what is necessary and productive rather than on slinging insults to gain personal power.Mary HellerPoughkeepsie, N.Y.A Citizen’s PleaTo the Editor:In a democracy, we have to go into an election knowing one side will lose. In a presidential election we become emotionally invested, which makes defeat one of the toughest losses we have to endure.In a democracy we have to be strong enough to accept defeat. More than that, if your candidate loses, you should still hope good things will happen in America while the other guy is in office. That’s what it means to be an American.When it comes down to it, we are all one. You don’t have to like the other guy, but don’t hate him. He should be respected for America’s sake.To refuse to acknowledge your candidate’s defeat, to hate the other guy — and worse yet, to hope he totally fails, with no regard for the country’s well-being — is un-American. Wallowing in hate, embracing it and spreading it, over time wreaks havoc on the mind. How is your mind?Tom HebbelnDavenport, IowaSlaughtering Animals for FoodTo the Editor:Re “South Korean Legislators Pass a Ban on Dog Meat” (news article, Jan. 10):I was relieved to read that South Korea recently prohibited slaughtering dogs for food. It is heartbreaking that these animals, cherished by many of us as members of our families, were being regarded essentially as pieces of meat. Yet that is the fate of billions of animals that suffer on factory farms around the world.Humans have drawn arbitrary lines between the animals we eat and those we see as companions without considering that they all have feelings. I hope this milestone moment can help us to realize that we can live well without killing and eating any animals, whether dogs, cats, pigs or cows.Gene BaurArlington, Va.The writer is president and a co-founder of Farm Sanctuary.This article appeared in print on page A23."
