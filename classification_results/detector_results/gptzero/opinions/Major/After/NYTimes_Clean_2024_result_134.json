            "inputText": "Young American women aren’t buying what these influencers are selling.Tradwife content has been a social media phenomenon for a few years, and even though the trend creates a lot of discourse online and off, I’ve resisted writing about it because I think it’s a trap.For the uninitiated, “A tradwife (short for traditional wife) is a woman,” typically a conservative Christian, “who prefers to take a traditional or ultratraditional role in marriage, including the belief that a woman’s place is in the home,” according toone of the genre’s more popular creators. These conventionally pretty influencers depict themselves cooking elaborate meals, tending to their children and doing housework. Their posts sometimes come withflorid captionsabout the joy and freedom that come from submitting to their husbands, becausebiblical submissiondoesn’t connote inferiority. They tend to dress either in 1950s cosplay or barefoot in gauzy, long dresses.The whole discussion can be a trap because the content itself is meant to be aheightened provocation— some tradwife creators post things that they label as triggering opinions and then say theyget so much hatefor being stay-at-home moms. But they rely on that dissonance in order to createmore engagement(which leads to more clicks and more money).These posts have a way of painting feminists as haters who resist their true nature and casting career womenin oppositionto women who don’t work for pay. The reality is that stay-at-home moms and working moms are frequently justthe same peopleat different points in their lives and that content creation is a paying job: My favorite example of this is the tradwife pitchinga $5,900 set of courseson how to be a tradwife.Further, there are tons of reasons any parent might opt to stay home that don’t require buying into tradwife values: Work isn’t always satisfying or well paid, some people want to spend a majority of their time with their kids, and child care is so expensive that it can push a lower-earning parent out of the labor market, to name a few. And asan avowed lover of #cleantok, I have no problem with content about household tasks, but that’s separate from what the tradwives are often cynically pushing. When people criticize the way tradwives troll, they’re very likely to respond that their detractors simply don’t value the hard work of raising children and running a household — when many of their critics value that work tremendously and do it themselves.That said, I’m not particularly concerned that young women watching TikTok are going to be soinfluenced by this contentthat they’ll start fleeing the secular world en masse to submit to their husbands, live on farms and bake aesthetic pies. That’s because young women are increasingly rejecting this specific kind of domestic arrangement. That was made clear this week, when it seemed as if every woman online rose up to push back against a retrogressive college graduation speech by Harrison Butker, a kicker for the Kansas City Chiefs. As my newsroom colleagues Scott Cacciola and Benjamin Hoffmanreport, Butker “urged women to forgo careers so that they could support their husbands.”And according to a November 2023surveyfrom the Survey Center on American Life at the American Enterprise Institute, 61 percent of Gen Z women said they considered themselves feminists, the highest percentage of any generation. And as the Survey Center’s Daniel A. Cox and Kelsey Eyre Hammondexplainedin April, “Young women are leaving church in unprecedented numbers,” partly because they “are more concerned about the unequal treatment of women in American society and are more suspicious of institutions that uphold traditional social arrangements.” Women areoutpacingmen in terms of college graduation rates, and prime-age women’s labor force participation is evengreaterthan it was before the Covid pandemic.Still, some tradwife creators appear to be popular if you look at their follower counts, and they certainly generate a lot of chatter. But I often think: Who is this content really for? Sure, some portion of their followers are probably like-minded women, but a newstudyfrom Media Matters made me wonder if the tradwife’s main audience is actually right-leaning men:Media Matters coded and analyzed 327 recommended videos after exclusively interacting with tradwife content and documented what happened. We found TikTok’s recommendation algorithm rapidly populated our F.Y.P. [For You page] with conspiracy theory content and fearmongering, which made up nearly one-third of all videos served to the F.Y.P.After interaction with tradwives, the study found, TikTok’s recommendation algorithm also served up “19 videos featuring extremist right-wing media figures,” such as Alex Jones and Nick Fuentes.(A related idea, put forth by the journalist and internet commentator Max Read in astoryby my friend Kathryn Jezer-Morton in The Cut, is that tradwife content is actually for men with something of a Donna Reed fetish: “Maybe it’s a different version of the e-girl phenomenon or the OnlyFans phenomenon. To the extent that I would worry about anything in the future, instead of creating a mass of tradwife women, it feels a lot like you’ll get one or two very famous ones, and a mass of simping male followers.”)Offline, the most extreme version of the ideology animating tradwife content has a devastating effect on many families. A new book by Cait West, “Rift: A Memoir of Breaking Away From Christian Patriarchy,” outlines just how harmful the maximalist expression of tradwife values can be to the children raised with them.West tells the story of how her father became more and more religious and radical over time, withdrawing her family from the secular world and exerting ever more control over everything her family members did. West calls her former self a “stay-at-home daughter” to describe the way she was trapped within her family structure and forced into a submissive and domestic role.She was home-schooled, and her family moved several times, so she wasn’t able to establish outside friendships easily. College wasn’t an option, even though she longed for an intellectual life, because she was supposed to develop only skills that would serve her as a future wife and mother. Her father tried to block her courtship with the son of their pastor for arbitrary reasons. His real reason, West writes, was that he knew marriage meant she would no longer be under his thumb.West isn’t the only one telling her truth. In the past couple of years, we’ve seen women from reality TV’s Duggar family break ranks to talk about the abuse they experienced or witnessed indocumentariesandmemoirs. This summer,Tia Levings, who was drawn into theQuiverfullmovement, will publish a book about her experience, “A Well-Trained Wife: My Escape From Christian Patriarchy.”Writing for UnHerd, Mary Harrington recentlyprofiledLauren Southern, a former right-wing influencer who left her husband and now describes her ultratraditional marriage as abusive. Harrington also spoke to another ex-tradwife, who said that “the men who self-select into these communities are often ‘wayward, antisocial, disagreeable and very, very misogynistic.’”If there’s anyone to worry about watching and absorbing tradwife content to the letter, I suspect that it’s these men. There are too many stories about fathers and husbands who abuse the power they have over their families and too many stories about the wives and children who flee their coercive control. Instead of continuing to talk about tradwives on TikTok or other social media outlets, even to debunk their limited appeal, we should spend more time elevating the stories of the people who made it out of these circumstances. Unlike the manicured, well-lit vision of idealized submission, stories like West’s have no filter.This article appeared in print on page A22."
