Indeed, it's clear that Hamas expected an overwhelming military response from Israel on the ground in Gaza, and that it hopes to provoke a long-term Israeli security presence against which it can, sooner rather than later, organize a sustained andincreasingly powerful insurgency.The obvious goal is to contrast this armed resistance, not just now, but especially in coming years, with PA security cooperation with Israel and the PLO's unwavering commitment to securing independence through a two-state agreement with Israel.The only rational choice left for Israel in the wake of October 7 is to finally choose to deal seriously and constructively with the Palestinians who are committed to talking to Israelis, as opposed to bolstering those who want to kill Israelis.It may go against all the instincts of many Israeli extremists in the current government, including Netanyahu, but if they do not begin to deal seriously, constructively and cooperatively with the PA and the PLO, Hamas and even more extreme groups will continue to thrive.This means taking any number of obvious measures to strengthen the PA institutionally and politically, including by expanding its authority in the West Bank.And it means reengaging with the PLO at the negotiating table to seriously discuss a viable accommodation that meets the needs of both peoples.Beyond Mahmoud AbbasMany Israelis may find it hard to imagine suddenly taking Mahmoud Abbas, who is both the PA president and the PLO chairman, seriously, both because they are used to thinking of him as a spent force and ineffective leader, and because he has lashed out in frustration with language that has been highly offensive, includingregarding the Holocaust.There is no doubt that Abbas is, in almost every imaginable way, long past his sell-by date. But the old, infirm and chain-smoking politician, who at least has time and again proven his unwavering rejection of violence as a Palestinian national strategy, represents exactly this trend among Palestinians. And when he passes, sooner rather than later, from the scene, he will be replaced by others from the same tendency.Israelis cannot approach this decisive strategic and political inflection point by focusing on the personality, failures or foibles of Abbas. In many ways, Israel's consistently hostile policies were the single biggest factor in shaping him into the highly flawed figure he has become.This is the Palestinian leader who, after all,resignedas Yasser Arafat's Prime Minister during the second intifada and voluntarily went into an open-ended sojourn in the political wilderness, precisely because he categorically rejected the use of violence.Moreover, it's not about Abbas or his inner circle as personalities. It must be about strengthening the hands of Palestinians who sincerely seek an accommodation with Jewish Israelis and represent the primary obstacle to Hamas finally achieving political dominance among Palestinians.It's a no-brainer, but Netanyahu and his government showno signs of understandingthe necessity of such a radical policy shift. The Biden administrationappears to understandthe challenge in theory, but how much they can or will do to implement such a revised policy towards the Palestinian political scene is uncertain at best.Given the profound governance, security and intelligencefailures revealed bythe October 7 attack - which was \"successful\" beyond Hamas's wildest fantasies -Israelis should certainly be seeking new leadership. If and when they at last turn their backs on Netanyahu and the coterie of Jewish supremacists surrounding him, it's essential that the next phase of Israeli strategic thinking reflects at least some understanding of the Palestinian political scene and what Israel's real options are.It's not too late to choose todeal seriously, respectfully and constructively with Palestinians who are sincere about a negotiated agreement for peaceful coexistence. The alternative was on full display on October 7.No amount of death and destruction in Gaza or elsewhere is going to provide Israel with lasting security. A negotiated agreement with the Palestinian factions who, despite everything, still want to reach a peace deal with Israel - for good or ill, currently led by Abbas - can bring that about. It's the only thing that can bring Israelis peace and genuine security.Opinion by Hussein IbishTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
