When energy prices rise, they increase the cost of harvesting, manufacturing and transporting the supplies and tools needed to build homes, increasing home prices in the process.The Biden administration has repeatedly pledged to move the U.S. economy away from oil, natural gas and other affordable fossil fuels, a promise it has kept through a series of international agreements and regulatory actions.Biden has substantially limited offshore oil and gas leases. His administration also stopped selling onshore oil and gas leases on federal lands, until a federal court ruled that the policy was illegal. Although Biden has since restarted selling leases, his administration has also dramatically increased fees while decreasing the acreage available for drilling.In April 2024, alone, the Biden administration restricted drilling and mining in Alaska and issued new regulations that would force oil companies to pay at least 10 times more to drill on lands owned by the federal government.These and many other policies have sent a clear signal to fossil-fuel companies: Biden and congressional Democrats are committed to killing most forms of traditional energy development.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONAs a result, many energy companies have scaled back operations, compared to pre-pandemic levels, and they have kept prices high.

They need to earn profits now, while they still can.There are many factors that affect housing prices, but two of the biggest are Biden’s reckless spending policies and his costly assault on traditional energy sources, such as oil and natural gas.Biden’s anti-fossil-fuel agenda has made energy much more expensive than it was during Trump’s time in office.For example, when Biden entered the White House in January 2021, the average price of gasoline was $2.32 per gallon. Last month, it was $3.73, and it hasn’t been lower than $3.00 since April 2021.Electricity prices have also soared to all-time highs under Biden. Consumers and businesses are now paying nearly 28% more than they did when Biden took office.These surging prices have contributed to higher costs for homebuilders, increasing home prices.Higher housing prices, higher mortgage rates, and little hope for improvement in the near term — that’s the real impact of Biden’s radical economic agenda.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JUSTIN HASKINSJustin Haskins is the director of the Socialism Research Center at The Heartland Institute and a New York Times bestselling author.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
