And while incumbent president Tsai Ing-wen cannot run again due to term limits, this could mark the first time that the incumbent political party (in this case, Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party or DPP) wins a third consecutive term.The island's election is particularly consequential given its pivotal role in the ongoing geopolitical tension between the United States and China.
