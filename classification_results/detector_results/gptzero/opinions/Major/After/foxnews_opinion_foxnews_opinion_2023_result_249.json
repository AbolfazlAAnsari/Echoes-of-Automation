The greatest generals in history always knew that there must be an element of showmanship to the battle.Always be in motion. The opposition, however clumsily, will start to fight back and try to engage you on their terms. Do not fall into the trap. When they zig, you must zag and keep moving forward to your goal.When you’re going up against the status quo, they will find a way to mobilize their political power and legacy media. That’s inevitable. What’s not inevitable is how you respond. When they finally confront you in the air, morph into a guerrilla operation that maneuvers on the ground.A battle will have ebbs and flows, and you will find yourself hitting a wall. External and internal dynamics will make it challenging to get past that wall into the green fields on the other side. Explode through the wall.All your work means nothing unless you believe in your cause and believe that you can win. Be flexible and open to ideas, but never take your eyes off the North Star and never forget why you joined the fight in the first place.Eventually your strategies and tactics, if well executed, will bring you to a moment when your opponent is on the ropes. They’ve made crucial mistakes to be in that situation. When this happens, it’s not time to back off. Go for the knockout.The greater the success, the greater the dangers that follow. Complacency will often set in as will the tendency to overly rely on the strategies and tactics that brought victory. Eventually your opponents will adapt and exploit.Parents and community members attend a Loudoun County School Board meeting on June 22, 2021.(REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein)Always know your endgame. What started as your primary goal may become subsumed into something much greater than you could have imagined. When it comes time to shift to that greater purpose, let your opponents distract themselves with what they think, while you silently redeploy your efforts to the final victory.As you put on your armor to go fight for your children’s present and future, remember these rules and let them serve as a guide in how you design your own approach. But do not limit yourselves to only these rules. Think through successes of the past in history, film, literature, business, politics, and sports and shape your own rules, stick to them, and pass them on to others.That is how we will win this fight together.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM IAN PRIORIan Prior, author of\"Parents of the World Unite,\" senior adviser at America First Legal, and executive director of Fight for Schools."
