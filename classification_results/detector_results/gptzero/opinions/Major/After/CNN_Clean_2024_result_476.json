Trump has been asked repeatedly about the Comstock Act and has thus far refused toanswer the question- a telling omission given his public position that the states, not the federal government, should decide the abortion question.And significantly, the 2024 election will be taken as a bellwether about whether voters actually care about issues related to reproductive rights. For years, conventional wisdom suggested that most voters opposedcriminalizing abortion- especially early in pregnancy- but that reproductive health issues were a top priority only for a relatively smallfraction of the electorate. That made Republicans comfortable tying themselves to the antiabortion movement, even if that movement's favored laws were unpopular: most voters may disagree, but few seemed to prioritize the issue.That assumption no longer seemed to hold true after the Dobbs decision. Democrats' position on abortion seems to have prevented a widely expected red wave inthe 2022 midterm. Voters who supported reproductive rights began ranking the issue as one of the mostcritical to their decision. It is for that reason that President Joe Biden and othershave made reproductive rights socentral to their campaigns.If Trump wins, pundits - and the GOP - will conclude that voters do not care much about reproductive issues after all. Republicans, who have been caught between the demands of base voters opposed to abortion and the majority unhappy with the status quo, will be sorely tempted to read a Trump win as a way out. Many Republicans will want to give the antiabortion movement more of what it wants without consequences. That means that if Trump wins, it could encourage far more aggressive actions on abortion by Republicans across the country.So it is absolutely right to think that abortion is on the ballot. But if anything, the stakes are far higher than the fight over ballot measures would suggest.Opinion by Mary ZieglerTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
