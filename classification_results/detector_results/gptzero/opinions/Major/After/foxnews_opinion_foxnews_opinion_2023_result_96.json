'Fox & Friends' co-hosts react.For years,President Bidenhas maintained a Sgt. Schultz defense (\"I know nothing, nothing!\") to counter allegations that his family has profiteered on influence peddling with foreign countries and companies.Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, Biden maintains that he \"knows nothing, nothing\" about son Hunter Biden's business deals. He recently doubled down on this defense by even denying that family members received money from foreign sources. He repeated his denial even after the release of financial transfer reports from his own administration showing millions transferred from China.Now,emails have emergedthat show that Biden personally helped draft responses to the controversial deals in 2015 when he was vice president. It also appears that Biden officials like former White House communications director Kate Bedingfield knew of his role even as the president continued to deny any involvement.KARINE JEAN-PIERRE RIPPED FOR CLAIMING BIDEN FAMILY'S $1M PAYOUT IS 'LIES': 'WE'RE LIVING IN AN INSANE TIME'The National Archives has released emails that show that then-Vice President Biden approved an official statement in December 2015 about Hunter Biden’s position on a Ukrainian energy company’s board.Biden has denied any knowledge or involvement in these business dealings at least seven times as a presidential candidate and as president.For years, the media has continued to report President Biden’s repeated claim that \"I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\"VP BIDEN'S OFFICE TRIED TO QUASH BLOOMBERG STORY ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN AT HIS FIRM'S REQUEST, EMAILS SHOWAt the outset, the media only had to suspend any disbelief that the president could fly to China as vice presidentwith his son on Air Force Twowithout discussing his planned business dealings on the trip.Of course, the emails on the laptop quickly refuted this claim. However, the media buried the laptop story before the election or pushed the false claim that it was fake Russian disinformation.Some in the media have repeated those denials, including most recentlyThe Associated Press, which in 2022 falsely stated that there was no evidence Biden ever discussed the deals with his son despite an actual audiotape proving that claim to be false.NINE BOXES OF BIDEN DOCUMENTS WERE TAKEN FROM BOSTON OFFICEThe audiotape showed President Biden leaving a message for Hunter specifically discussing coverage of those dealings:\"Hey pal, it’s Dad. It’s 8:15 on Wednesday night. If you get a chance just give me a call. Nothing urgent. I just wanted to talk to you. I thought the article released online, it’s going to be printed tomorrow in the Times, was good. I think you’re clear. And anyway if you get a chance give me a call, I love you.\"Some of us have written for two years thatPresident Biden’s denial of knowledgeis patently false. It was equally evident that the Biden family was selling influence and access. There are emails of Ukrainian and other foreign clients thanking Hunter Biden for arranging meetings with his father. There are photos from dinners and meetings that tie President Biden to these figures, including a 2015 dinner with a group of Hunter Biden’s Russian and Kazakh clients.INVESTMENT FIRM OF FORMER OBAMA-BIDEN OFFICIALS HOSTED MULTIPLE CCP-TIED COMPANIES AT 2015 LUNCHEONPeople apparently were told to avoid directly referring to President Biden. In one email, Tony Bobulinski, then a business partner of Hunter’s, was instructed by Biden associate James Gilliar not to speak of the former veep’s connection to any transactions: \"Don’t mention Joe being involved, it’s only when u [sic] are face to face, I know u [sic] know that but they are paranoid.\"Instead, the emails apparently refer to President Biden with code names such as \"Celtic\" or \"the big guy.\" In one, \"the big guy\" is discussed as possibly receiving a 10 percent cut on a deal with a Chinese energy firm; other emails reportedly refer toHunter Biden paying portionsof his father’s expenses and taxes.Bobulinski has given multiple interviews in which he stated that he met twice with Joe Biden to discuss a business deal in China with CEFC China Energy Co. That would seem obvious evidence. In addition, the New York Post reported on a key email that discussed \"the proposed percentage distribution of equity in a company created for a joint venture with CEFC China Energy Co.\" That was the email on March 13, 2017, that included references of \"10 held by H for the big guy.\"The new emails show that, as early as 2015, Bedingfield toldHunter’s top financial lieutenant Eric Schwerinvia email that Joe Biden approved a statement regarding Hunter’s board position. Yet, for years, Biden's communications office repeated his denial of any involvement or knowledge. That stands in contradiction to Bedingfield's 2015 email acknowledging that \"VP signed off on this — will give this quote to reporters in my name shortly.\" Bedingfield left the White House earlier this year.White House director of communications Kate Bedingfield speaks during a briefing in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 2022.(NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images)The White House has continued the categorical denials. When confronted by Fox News’ Peter Doocy on the transfer records showing millions sent from China, White House press secretaryKarine Jean-Pierreresponded:\"Look, I’m just not going to respond to that from here. Look, we have heard from House Republicans for years and years and years how — the inaccuracies and lies when it comes to this issue. And, I don’t even where to begin to even answer that question because, again, it’s been lies and lies and inaccuracy for the past couple of years and I’m just not going to get into it from here.\"The only reason that Biden would even attempt to maintain this clearly false defense is that he could count on asupportive mediato blunt any attacks and limit inquiries.Of course, there is a difference with the Sgt. Schulz defense. Schultz, the character in the famed sitcom \"Hogan's Heroes,\" was harmless and comical. The Biden influence peddling allegation is neither. Despite the striking lack of interest from many in the media, this is about millions of dollars paid to the first family by foreign sources, including some with foreign intelligence ties.Influence peddling has long been the favored form of corruption in Washington. While many Democrats repeatedly stress that influence peddling is not criminal, it is corrupt andthe Bidensappear to be a class in themselves. Yet, even with the clear contradiction of the president's repeated statements to the public, Democrats still oppose any investigation into the alleged influence peddling.What made Sgt. Schultz funny is precisely whythe Biden defenseis collapsing. The refusal of the media to see what is now in plain view will convince no one.At some point, Democratic leaders will have to recognize the obvious or join the Bidens (and many journalists) in the cast of this theater of the absurd.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JONATHAN TURLEYJonathan Turley is a Fox News Media contributor and the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University. He is the author of \"The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage\" (Simon & Schuster, June 18, 2024)."
