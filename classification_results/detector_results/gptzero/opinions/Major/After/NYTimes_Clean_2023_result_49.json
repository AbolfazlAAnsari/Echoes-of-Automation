Our goal is to give you some new help in that process.Here is some information about our data and methodology:Where the data came fromThe tool uses data from three sources: the U.S. Department of Education via theNational Center for Education Statisticsand theCollege Scorecard,Niche.comandOpportunity Insights. The data is from the Department of Education unless noted otherwise.We have over 900 four-year U.S. colleges and universities in our database, all of them nonprofit institutions with at least 500 students.We included only colleges and universities where more than 50 percent of students graduated within eight years; as a result, many four-year colleges will not show up in your rankings list if they have low graduation rates. Filtering for schools that graduate more than half their students removes hundreds of schools from our sample, some of them prominent institutions in their communities. But we believe this is an important criterion for inclusion, givenhow serious a problemthe college dropout rate is in America.We also included only schools that have data for at least three of the 10 measures that we used to weight our rankings. And we included schools where more than 75 percent of the students were attending full-time. We excluded military colleges, maritime colleges, federal service academies, special focus colleges and online universities.Earnings are based on the median income of people who attended the school 10 years ago and who received federal aid. These figures are from 2021.Roughly speaking, there are two prices for college: the price that schools advertise (the sticker price) and the price that students who receive  federal financial aid actually end up paying after aid from the school, state and federal government are factored in (the net price).For students who know that their family probably won’t be offered much aid, using the sticker price may yield more results in line with their priorities. But if they expect to receive some funding from the state government, the federal government or the institution, then the net price should be a better metric. In instances where the institution offers both in-state and out-of-state prices, the tool uses the in-state price when calculating the rankings. In the rare instances where a school doesn’t report on-campus housing prices, we report the sticker price for a student living off-campus. The sticker price is from the 2022-23 academic school year and the net price is from 2020-2021.The economic mobility measure is theresult of a 2017 analysisfrom Opportunity Insights that tried to determine which schools in America were most successful at helping students from low-income families reach the upper classes. The specific income mobility measure we used was the probability that a student from a family in the bottom 40 percent of household income would eventually reach the top 40 percent.Some schools share a systemwide identifier (the University of Massachusetts, for example), so in these cases, the mobility figures will be an average for the entire group of colleges.The economic diversity score uses the same data to look at the household income of the students attending each college. Weconstructed an indexbased on the proportion of the student body who come from each quintile of household income. Schools with a more even distribution of students from all income levels will score higher.The academic profile score is an even mix of standardized test scores (SAT and ACT), graduation rates and student-faculty ratio. Each measure is standardized and averaged to create one composite score. In instances where one of the three academic measures is missing, the composite score will be an average of the other two measures.Racial diversity is an index based on the racial composition of the undergraduate population as reported to the Department of Education and reflects the racial composition of the school during the 2022-23 academic school year.Thecampus safety,party sceneandathleticsscores are based on data and self-reported student surveys compiled and provided byNiche.com.Our definition of STEM includes computer science, mathematics, medicine, psychology, physical science, social science and engineering.Our definition of the humanities includes English, history, journalism, languages, law, literature, philosophy, religious studies and theology.How the rankings are calculatedThe data behind each slider is normalized and then weighted according to the relative value provided by the reader. Then we add up all the weighted scores for each school and rank according to the highest total. You can view the full calculation for the score of any college at the bottom of the school’s listing.Within a school’s listed data, percentages may not add up to 100 percent because of rounding.No rankings created by readers are stored or otherwise recorded by The New York Times. Any data you enter stays in your web browser.Some schools haven’t published certain data (for instance,earnings aren’t availablefor Penn State), which may result in a lower than expected ranking, particularly if the reader weights that data very heavily.Of course, it is always possible for errors to find their way into an analysis of over 900 American colleges. If you think you’ve found one, please send an email toopinion-college-rankings@nytimes.comto let us know."
