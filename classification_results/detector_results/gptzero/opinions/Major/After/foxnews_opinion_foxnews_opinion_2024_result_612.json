So sure, make the point that Trump did not get into such granular accounting details (especially once he was president and had far weightier responsibilities); but donâ€™t make it look like the defense is afraid of the NDAs as if they were illegal.I expect three other things on Thursday (and as the trial continues into next week):Braggâ€™s allegation that Cohenâ€™s invoices are false (asCohen testifiedthey were) is based on Cohenâ€™s testimony that (a) there was actually no retainer agreement, and (b) the monthly payments of $35,000 were really for reimbursement for the Stormy Daniels NDA in 2016, not â€“ as the invoices suggest â€“ for ongoing legal work in 2017.This story is collapsing.Retainers do not have to be in writing, so the fact that there isnâ€™t a written retainer does not settle the question of whether Trump retained Cohen as a lawyer after 2016. Cohen has now admitted that it was agreed that he could represent himself in 2017 as the presidentâ€™s private lawyer, and he admits that he did legal work for Trump in 2017-18 â€“ not a lot, but some. Clients often have a retainer agreement, not to pay for ongoing work, but to pay forthe lawyerâ€™s availability if something comes up. And itâ€™s obvious that the 2017 installment payments, which totaled $420,000, were about more than the $130,000 for the Stormy NDA â€” they included a bonus, which, regardless of what Cohen says, could be for past work or future availability.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONTo summarize, then: Cohen was holding himself out as Trumpâ€™s lawyer throughout 2017, he was available to work for Trump whenever asked, and he did in fact do lawyer work for him in 2017-18. And the Trump Organization knew it was paying for more than the Stormy Daniels NDA. So how could it befraudulently falsefor the Trump org CFO to refer to payments to Cohen as pursuant to aretainer? Cohen did the things a retained lawyer does.Costello is a savvyNew York defense lawyerwho represented Cohen at the start of the federal investigation. He has been released from his attorney-client confidentiality obligation (because Cohen waived confidentiality when he told the feds about his discussions with Costello). On Tuesday, Costello testified before a House committee, asserting that Cohenâ€™s testimony was rife with lies â€“ a claim Costellos says he can back up with emails, texts, etc. Costello also testified to that effect in the grand jury.I expect Blanche will use Costelloâ€™s House and grand jury testimony in attacking Cohen on cross-examination.Could Costello end up being a witness if there is a defense case? Up until now, Iâ€™ve surmised that there would be no defense case, and that Team Trump would rely on the weakness of the prosecutionâ€™s case. But Costello is an option for the defense (unless Team Trump decides it has sufficiently demolishedCohenâ€™s credibilityduring cross-examination).Team Trump should renew its request to call former FEC official Bradley Smith as an expert witness in the defense case to explain why NDAs are not actionablecampaign expendituresunder federal law. Judge Merchan has previously indicated he would not permit such expert testimony, rationalizing that only the court should instruct the jury on the law. But Merchan has let Cohen and David Pecker explain to the jury that they believed the NDAs violated federal law.Especially given that Bragg has no authority to enforce federal law, and Merchan has no expertise in it, shouldnâ€™t the jury hear from at least one person who actually knows something about the subject?The end of the trial is nearing, but there are still twists and turns to play out.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANDREW McCARTHYAndrew C.
