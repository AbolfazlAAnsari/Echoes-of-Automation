Butif winning is everything, how do players and fans cope with losing?Super Bowl XLVIII pits two great teams against one another. The Kansas City Chiefs under Patrick Mahomes, seemingly thesecond coming of Tom Brady, face off against the San Francisco 49ers led by the shockingly good Brock Purdy, who was literally the last player drafted in 2022 and earned the name \"Mr. Irrelevant.\"Only one will win. And congratulations to the team that does. Come Super Bowl night, fans of the winning team will be celebrating not just across America, but worldwide, thanks to the NFL’s growing global fan base. The stadium will be filled with confetti and players will be lost in the greatest feeling in sports – winning.Brock Purdy of the San Francisco 49ers and Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs stand on stage during Super Bowl LVIII Opening Night at Allegiant Stadium on Feb. 5, 2024 in Las Vegas.(Candice Ward/Getty Images)You can just hear, \"We Are The Champions\" playing in the background. Americans, we love a winner.SUPER BOWL LVIII: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE GAMEThe other team will be defined by the loss. Forever known by that loss. No matter how many games you win, if you lose the big game, that’s what fans remember. As general manager Billy Beane said it in the movie \"Moneyball,\" \"If you lose the last game of the season, nobody gives a s---.\"Only, nearly every team that makes the playoffs loses the last game of the season. In all of the NFL’s 32 teams, 31 are losers. Most didn’t even get to the playoffs. Some make a habit of it. The Super Bowl era has featured 57 big games, yet a dozen teams have never won the trophy. And it weighs heavily on their franchises and the fans.TheCleveland Browns have come to definethis annualized failure. The Browns are a storied franchise that has its roots in the early days of football, when it dominated. But the hapless Browns have never reached a Super Bowl and no matter what they do, the team seems to self-destruct.The Browns have had 38 starting quarterbacks since they returned to the NFL after a brief, three-year hiatus. That number is so astronomical that a photo of a fan went viral in January because the man wore a jersey with a near-complete list on the back. The photo even ran in USA Today.NFL PLAYERS REACT TO TAYLOR SWIFT EFFECT HEADING INTO SUPER BOWL LVIIIFor a few of those 12 teams, losing still showed growth. TheDetroit Lions made itto the championship and won their first playoff game since 1992. That’s something to be excited about, the prospect of the team finally turning around.Lions quarterback Jared Goff throws during an NFC Divisional Playoff game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Detroit on Jan. 21, 2024.(Amy Lemus/NurPhoto via Getty Images)The same holds true for the Houston Texans under rookie quarterback sensation C.J. Stroud. If he continues to play at a similar level, the Texans are looking at years of playoff level competition.The rest of the teams, not so much. And even one of the Super Bowl teams is going home empty-handed. For fans, losing is a harsh reminder about some of the realities of life. No one wins all the time. Not even the biggest stars and most famous teams. If they can lose and move forward, then the rest of us can, too.So how are fans supposed to deal? Here are just a few guidelines to help you lose gracefully:The majority of Americans considerfootball to be America’s sport.I get that. I do as well. But it’s not the only sport. True sports fans find solace in rooting for multiple sports and different teams. This isn’t romance. You aren’t cheating on your first love.PLAYERS FROM CHIEFS AND 49ERS HAVE A CHANCE TO BREAK SINGLE GAME RECORDS DURING SUPER BOWL LVIIIThat means it’s time for baseball for many of us. (Go, Orioles!) Pitchers and catchers start reporting on Feb. 14, for spring training. Others can move on to the NBA and NHL seasons.

I’ve watched everything from Rock Paper Scissors tournaments to Australian Rules Football. If you can hold out, the 2024 Summer Olympics start in Paris on July 26. Anything to avoid election politics.Some of us are NFL addicts. No amount of the other three big-name sports will satisfy us. Accept it and focus the offseason on how your team will do next year. For football fans, that means the scouting combine and the draft. It’s the ultimate intersection of college football fandom and the pro addiction.TheScouting Combine runsFeb. 27-March 4 and is a great chance to see some big surprises for the coming year. Draft time is just around the corner, in Detroit, Michigan, on April 25–27. Hardly any time at all.
