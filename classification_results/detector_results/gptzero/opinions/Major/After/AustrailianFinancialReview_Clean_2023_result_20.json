            "inputText": "Canberra Observed Given the long and violent history of the Israeli-Arab conflict, views towards it are pre-formed, polarised and, in most cases, utterly intransigent.Israel's ambassador to Australia, Amir Maimon, struck a somewhat bewildered tone when he addressed the National Press Club on Wednesday.Less than three weeks ago, in what was Israel's biggest intelligence failure since the Yom Kippur war 50 years ago, Hamas terrorists infiltrated from the Gaza Strip and shot, butchered and burnt alive 1400 Israelis. Yet, in the court of global opinion, as the bombs fell on Gaza, Israel was finding itself increasingly on the defensive.It began pushing back at the start of this week, worried, as a government spokesman said, that the atrocities perpetrated by Hamas were subject to a \"Holocaust-denial-like phenomenon unfolding in real time\".The 2050 foreign journalists who have so far flown to Israel post-October 7 and registered with the Government Press Office (GPO) were offered a viewing of a 43-minute film of unedited and uncensored footage of men, women and children being massacred. The footage was taken from the body cameras of dead and captured Hamas operatives and other sources.Separate footage of Hamas detainees under interrogation, detailing their crimes and the orders they received, was released, as was the manual they were provided with on how to go about abducting people.Journalists were, and continue to be, offered bus trips to kibbutzim such a Be'eri, where the worst atrocities took place, to see for themselves the destruction, speak to survivors, and interview members of the ZAKA International Rescue Unit, which had the task of collecting the bodies.Israel's medical examiners, who are having trouble identifying many of the bodies due either to the extent of the butchery or the victim being burnt alive, have been made available for interview.Maimon's message this week was along the same lines. \"As I stand here, it is difficult for me to recount the shocking details of this terrorist onslaught. But we cannot look away. We must face this absolute evil to understand why Israel is determined to defeat this murder machine,\" he said.\"Beginning at 06:30 on Saturday morning, over 1500 armed terrorists broke into homes and gunned down whole families while they slept. Using steel wire, they bound mother to daughter, grandmother to grandson, and burned them alive. Do not look away from this evil. You must know what happened.\"They decapitated babies with knives, they raped young girls, they cut open a pregnant woman's belly. They set fire to buildings, burning them to the ground while people were hiding inside.\"This, he said, was Israel's equivalent to the September 11, 2001 terror attacks; yet, he argued, Israel was being treated differently.\"For me, as an Israeli, it is hard to understand why the world finds it a bit more challenging to stand behind Israel,\" he said. \"I don't recall when the twin towers were attacked that the [US] was questioned about their military objectives, nor about the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan.\"Not immediately anyway. But eventually, plenty were questioning the intention to invade Iraq. The US was warned by Europe and the Arab world that invading Iraq for no good reason other than that its secular dictator was no longer of use and may turn rogue, would have dire consequences.\"When it is over, if it is over, this war will have horrible consequences,\" Egypt's then-president Hosni Mubarak said a week after the war began in March 2003. \"Instead of having one [Osama] bin Laden, we will have 100 bin Ladens.\"One of those consequences was the rise of Hamas in the 2006 elections for the Palestinian territories. Already designated a terrorist organisation by Israel, Hamas viewed the Palestinian Authority as illegitimate due to its negotiations with the Israelis. With the war in Iraq having morphed into a predictable disaster by inflaming the region, Hamas won 44.5 per cent of the vote, giving it 74 of the 132 seats. The lurking corollary was no more.Maimon's lament at the Press Club about Israel losing the PR battle was due in large part to the daily images of the carnage in Gaza caused by the Israeli reprisals as it sought to weaken Hamas' network before its troops enter the enclave.Moreover, very few engage in debate over the Israel-Palestine conflict with an open mind. To many, this is not some binary case of righteousness versus evil, as in the case of Ukraine defending itself against Russia.Given the long and violent history of the Israeli-Arab conflict, views towards it are pre-formed, polarised and, in most cases, utterly intransigent. Even when a hideous atrocity is perpetrated, such as that on October 7, views range from outright condemnation to a search for some moral equivalence to, as we saw outside the Sydney Opera House, celebration.In Australia, it has been a struggle for the government to find the right language as it negotiates its own internal dynamics.Foreign Minster Penny Wong was criticised for failing to grasp the moral clarity of the situation when her initial reaction was to call for restraint from both sides. From that, she shifted towards standing with Israel and its right to defend itself, saying that Hamas was doing the Palestinians harm, to, more recently, calling on Israel to cool its jets for the good of the Palestinians and its own security.On Wednesday, she warned: \"The way Israel exercises its right to defend itself matters. It matters to civilians throughout the regions, and ... to Israel's ongoing security.\" Hers is far from an isolated view, but Israel is not overly fussed about what Australia thinks. The relationship between the Albanese government and Benjamin Netanyahu is not close. At the time of writing, Netanyahu had yet to take a call from our PM, although one was planned.Much of the government's focus is on maintaining social cohesion at home.Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil, who recently held a hook-up with her Five Eyes counterparts about the domestic implications of events in Israel, was unfazed when ministers Ed Husic and Anne Aly, both Muslims, took issue with Israel's actions in Gaza. The view among O'Neil and her colleagues was that it would help with social cohesion for the Arab community to know it had friends in government.It's a balancing act, at home and abroad.Phillip Coorey is The Australian Financial Review's political editor."
