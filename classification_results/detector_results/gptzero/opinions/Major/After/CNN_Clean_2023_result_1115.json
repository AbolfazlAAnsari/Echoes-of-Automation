Horrified, she threw up her hands: Not at all! She pointed to the simple fact that, enshrined in Article 2 of the French Constitution, is the immutable reality that\"the language of the Republic is French.\"There's just some tinkering going on.Gruny told me in her offices in the Senate overlooking a corner of the Jardins de Luxembourg, \"I find today that like equality between men and women, it was a struggle for years, we have made progress on the subject.\"Indeed, when I entered her offices and extended my hand, saying \"Senatrice Gruny?\" she smiled and wagged her finger. \"No, no, no - Senator.\"Unsurprisingly, in this deeply divided French government and nation, a lot of this has now descended into politics, which will still make the bill a landmine when it makes its way to its next hurdle - passage in the National Assembly.The left doesn't like this idea of removing feminisms. As Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the left-wing populist France Insoumise (France Unbowed) partysaid on X: \"The French language belongs to those who speak it.\"But the right embraces it. Even French President Emmanuel Macron, the epitome of centrism, suggested thatthe proposed bill might not be such a bad idea. And he is someone who hasembraced all efforts to cement Frenchas a central language for the world.Indeed, last month, the Macron governmentfiled two complaints with the European Union's top court, charging that European bureaucrats are all too often hired on the basis of tests given only in English - a case of blatant discrimination.It's all part of the French president's ongoing campaign to boost the use of French everywhere. Around the same time Gruny's bill passed the Senate, Macron inaugurated the Cite International de la Langue Francaise (The International City of the French language) in theChateau de Villers-Cotterets, built in 1532 by King Francois I after he returned from imprisonment in Spain.As Macron put itin his inauguration of the Cite, \"We must allow this [French] language to live, but also keep its foundations, the bases of its grammar, the strength of its syntax, and not give in to the air of the times. In this language, the masculine is the neutral.\"All utterly ironic in a language where every noun is either masculine or feminine - a true landmine for anyone trying to learn this language without having grown up with it. So, a newspaper is un journal (masculine), but television is la television (feminine).Frankly, as someone who has spoken and read French my entire adult life (and continues to struggle with its often-bizarre masculinity or femininity), I'd love to rid French of all its inclusiveness.
