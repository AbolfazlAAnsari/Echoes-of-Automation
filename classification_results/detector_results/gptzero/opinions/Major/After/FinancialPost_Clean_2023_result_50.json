Annis rendered a judgment in that case that was later overturned by a unanimous bench of the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA). He is very critical of the appeal court's decision, which he believes rests on \"foundational errors\" and fails to consider the importance of \"merit\" in civil service hiring practices.The case involved André Dionne, a bilingual francophone employee of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) situated in Quebec, who argued that he had a right under the OLA not to be forced to work in his second language just because he happened to be bilingual.As lawyers who represented Dionne, it would be inappropriate for us to debate the merits of Annis's reasons in the pages of a newspaper. However, the post-judgment comments reported in Ivison's story present an incomplete, and thus deeply flawed, picture of the issues before the court and the effect of the decisions rendered. We therefore feel compelled to provide certain clarifications.Two statements in particular stand out as in need of further context.First, Ivison's article reports that, according to Annis, the effect of the FCA ruling is to grant the pre-eminence of francophone language rights, to the detriment of unilingual anglophones. This is highly inaccurate. The FCA's judgment does not give priority to the rights of francophones in any way, shape or form. Rather, it seeks to ensure that they enjoy the same rights as their anglophone colleagues.Annis ruled that bilingual individuals have, simply by virtue of being bilingual, a duty to \"accommodate\" their unilingual colleagues. In his view, federal institutions are entitled to take advantage of employees who happen to be bilingual, without needing to show that it would be impossible or unreasonable to arrange things in such a way as to enable them to work in their primary language, should they wish to do so. Thus, if we follow his reasoning, bilingual people have lesser language rights than their unilingual colleagues, who are entitled to be provided with all the resources they need to do their jobs in their language of choice.While this might seem, at first glance, simply pragmatic, it would in fact systematically deprive francophones (who are much more likely to be bilingual) of rights that anglophones (who are mostly unilingual) enjoy. According to the Supreme Court of Canada's 1999 decision in R v. Beaulac, which has been reaffirmed multiple times since, this kind of unequal treatment is proscribed by the OLA.Annis had, acting on his own initiative, deliberately refused to apply the Beaulac decision to the case, on the basis of an entirely novel interpretation - one that none of the parties had espoused. The FCA overturned his decision because it flatly contradicted this binding precedent. According to the FCA, his reading of it \"is in no way supported by either the case law or the wording of the provisions at issue.\"Thus, in overturning Judge Annis' decision, the FCA merely reverted to existing precedent and did not break new ground. It also called Annis to task for assuming, without any evidence, that francophones receive preferential treatment in the federal civil service and that the OLA provides them with an \"advantageous\" position. The FCA noted that \"these comments are unacceptable and reflect negative stereotypes that call into question the value of francophone employees in the public service.\"Second, Ivison's article states that, \"Annis ruled that (granting the order requested) would give priority to francophone language rights over the principle of merit in federal institution staffing,\" and that the FCA simply \"ignored\" this problem. Here, too, essential elements of context are left out that make the statement misleading.Annis held that Section 91 of the OLA prohibits the OSFI from designating a position located in an English-dominant region (Toronto) as bilingual for the purposes of enabling it to meet its linguistic obligations in a bilingual region (Montreal). In his view, Sec. 91 provides that \"merit\" - defined entirely independently of language skills - takes precedence over language rights, and designating a Toronto-based position as bilingual would be the equivalent of abandoning merit as the basis of the appointment.However, as Annis himself admits, the language skills needed to enable an institution to meet its duties under the act are obviously a question of merit. Indeed, as the Public Service Employment Act explicitly states(https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2003-c-22-ss-12-13/latest/sc-2003-c-22-ss-12-13.html#sec30), \"official language proficiency\" is part of the definition of \"merit.\" Similarly, the plain meaning of Sec. 91(https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-31-4th-supp/latest/rsc-1985-c-31-4th-supp.html#sec91) is to authorize federal institutions to impose language requirements when needed to meet their duties under the act.Thus, the only real issue on this score was whether the OLA prohibits using staff located in unilingual regions to meet obligations towards bilingual regions. As there is nothing whatsoever in the OLA to suggest this conclusion, the FCA summarily rejected the argument. In doing so, it did not \"ignore\" the question of merit, but simply relied on the standard definition of it.National PostÉrik Labelle Eastaugh is an associate professor in the faculty of law at the University of Moncton.
