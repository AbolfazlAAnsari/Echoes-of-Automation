Maybe Alcott wanted to be a man, or maybe being a man was the only way to get what she really wanted: freedom to be herself.Roxana WitterDenverBrazil’s Insurrection, and Parallels to Jan. 6To the Editor:Re “In Brazil Capital, a Frenzied Mob Storms Congress” (front page, Jan. 9):If anyone needed further evidence that the dangerous, misguided claims of rigged elections by former President Donald Trump had horrific domestic and international implications, they need look no further than the insurrection that recently took place at Brazil’s government offices.The parallels to the awful events that occurred on Jan. 6 two years ago are unmistakable. Both featured a democratically ousted president unwilling to accept his loss and a subsequent insurrection.One of the hallmarks of the United States’ democracy is the peaceful transition of power between presidents. What happened on Jan. 6 was terrible and should be called out in no subtle terms.The insurrection that took place at Brazil’s government offices proved that former President Trump’s dangerous strategy of denying democratic elections lives on and poses a danger to our democracy’s survival.And if we want to save democracy not only in the United States but also across the world, we must reject and call out any election denying before it is too late.Kiran BhatiaBrookline, Mass.A Word From a GhostwriterTo the Editor:Re “The Ghosts in the Prose” (Weekend Arts, Jan. 6):As the co-author of 10 books — for authors ranging from famous folks to unknown heroes — I think your article about ghostwriting misses an important point.There’s a good reason that co-writers should have their names on the covers. As everyone with a byline in today’s paper knows, having your name on something you’ve written offers more than ego gratification and something for your mom to clip out. It also conveys responsibility.If your name is on it and something is wrong, it’s you who gets the blame — a fear that keeps you honest and careful.When celebrities pretend they’ve written their stories without help they may be perpetrating the smallest of lies. But I like to think that when authors are honest and up front about having co-authors, it allows the reader a little more faith in the rest of the stories that they, and we, are telling.Ghosts can’t be seen. Writers should be.Philip LermanMadridLaw School RankingsTo the Editor:Re “After Law Schools Boycott, U.S. News Will Change Its Influential Ranking System” (news article, Jan. 3):Many years ago when I coached a college mock trial team, a coach from another college asked me where I had gone to law school. I told him the name of the school (now known as U.C. College of the Law, San Francisco) and he remarked that, like his own school (U.C.L.A.), it was one of the 50 or so law schools in the nation’s top 20.His comment underscored the fact that the U.S. News &amp; World Report law schools ranking system hadn’t yet cemented itself into the public’s consciousness as the arbiter of law schools’ worth.The recent decision by the “top” law schools to deny U.S. News access to data is a positive move and hopefully portends a future in which applicants to law schools rely on their own judgment to pick a school to attend, rather than rely on a phony ranking system.Patrick MattimorePattaya, ThailandCredit for Resisting TemptationTo the Editor:“Give Me Credit for All the Bad Things I Didn’t Do,” by Crispin Sartwell (Opinion guest essay, Dec. 31), makes me wish my scale would take this advice.
