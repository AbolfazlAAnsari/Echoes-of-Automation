Wokeness pushes a separation between parent and child.Wokeness pushes a separation between parent and child.We open our book with a history chapter and the roots of this wokeness in totalitarian regimes of the past. We trace how places like the Soviet Union, Mao’s China,Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge, and others, tried to sever the family connection as a way of pushing their indoctrination on to the kids and, by extension, the parents.DOCTOR WARNS 'WOKE' AGENDA GAINING FOOTHOLD IN MEDICAL COLLEGES: 'DIVERSITY ABOVE MERIT'We are seeing it happen in America today. Kids are told to keep secrets from their parents. Sometimes the secrets are life-changing.Just recently the story broke about aLong Island teacherwho had transitioned a child from girl to boy behind the backs of the parents.

Parents who think they are safe from the reaches of wokeness because they live in a conservative area have to think again.We heard so many stories like this one, about parents being cut out of their child’s life.Part of the reason we wrote this book is we saw the concern that so many people have, correctly, about the indoctrination that happens atcollege campuses. What alarmed us is that it starts far earlier than college now and parents seem unprepared to grapple with the onslaught.Children are being cut out of parents' lives and told to keep secrets from their parents.(iStock)This wokeness doesn’t just target children at school. We trace the way this forced conformity has taken hold atmedical schools, teachers’ colleges, publishing companies and so on.Everyone is afraid to speak up and step out of line.
