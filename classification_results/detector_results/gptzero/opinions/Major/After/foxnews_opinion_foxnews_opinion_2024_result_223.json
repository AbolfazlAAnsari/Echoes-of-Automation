The desire for change, especially among young Iranians, was palpable.In all three contests, voters rejected the right but opted for change.If, in fact, Americans share Europe’s and Iran’s anti-incumbent instincts, Trump might well be propelled to a landslide victory in November – particularly after the failed assassination attempt. Trump, a convicted felon, could well win despite his nostalgic slogan: Make America Great Again, Again.While many Democrats sensed the widespread yearning for change at the top of their own presidential ticket, President Biden’s protracted resistance to withdrawing from the race has cost his party time, money and momentum. Despite the fact that he had been trailing Trump in the polls for months, long before his disastrous debate, Biden’s refusal to honor his initial campaign pledge to step aside after one term, and his adamant insistence that only he could defeat the MAGA candidate, threw his party into turmoil.Now that he has been forced to withdraw by colleagues who persuaded him that his name on the ballot would likely cost Democrats control of both the House and the Senate, Democrats have been scrambling to chart a winning course with Vice President Kamala Harris or another plausible, but unlikely alternative as their nominee. But now, at last, Americans may finally have the choice so many want — two versions of change, rather than the more conventional choice of incumbent versus challenger that Biden’s nomination would have ensured.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JUDITH MILLERJudith Miller is a former Fox News contributor, an award-winning author, an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a contributing editor of its magazine, City Journal, as well as a theater critic for Tablet Magazine.
