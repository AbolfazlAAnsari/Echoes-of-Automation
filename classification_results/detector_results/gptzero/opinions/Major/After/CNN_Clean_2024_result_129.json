It funds the very\"border-barrier construction\"Trump ran on not once but twice and restricts the use of what is known as humanitarian parole, in which immigrants can seek temporary legal status that allows migrants to not only enter the country but legally work.The same so-called bipartisan bill completely leaves out the future status of the roughly580,000 active DACA recipients, or Dreamers, whose parents brought them to this country as children without legal status.\"Dreamers are Americans,\"Biden tweeted back in 2020 during his winning presidential campaign. \"But Trump ripped away the hard-won protections of DACA recipients, throwing their lives into upheaval. It's unacceptable, and on day one of my presidency I will protect them from deportation and send a bill to Congress.\"Now, Biden is stomaching a piece of legislation that negates that promise and many more. Instead, presumably in the name of a re-election quest, his administration as well as rank-and-file Democrats are treating DACA recipients much like Republicans do: as political pawns worth sacrificing as they search for so-called common ground with a group of bad-faith actors who do not care what happens at the border, only that they can campaign off of it.A compromise assumes that both parties have a general understanding of give, get, lose, gain - a concept that no longer exists in Republican politics but one that Democrats seem hellbent on holding onto. This is not the Republican Party of days long past, yet every year Democrats refuse to act accordingly. As a result, they have started to regurgitate right-wing immigration talking points, using words like\"border crisis\"and\"flow of deadly fentanyl\" when all evidence points to the contrary. In 2022 seizures of fentanyl were up 480% compared to 2020,according to US Customs and Border Protection- proof that border security is doing its job and intercepting smugglers and shipments of illegal drugs.And despite the pearl-clutching and fearmongering of GOP politicians and punditswarning of an immigrant \"invasion,\"Republican lawmakers still shot down the agreement intended to address what the House speakercalled a \"catastrophe\"at the border. As Sen. Krysten Sinema of Arizona - who was arguably a Republican in Democrat clothing until becoming a member of the Independent party -said on the Senate floor,\"After all their cable news appearances, after all those campaign photo ops in the desert, after all those trips to the border, this crisis isn't actually much of a crisis at all.\"If the Democrats want to win in 2024 and beyond, it would behoove the party to stop treating the GOP as anything other than a farce and, instead, stay true to the morals, ethics and values they claim to champion. To stoop to the level of the Republican Party, where the bar is already in Satan's basement, is to diminish this country's political state as a whole. Don't take a page out of the GOP's manual; burn it.The American voter deserves a party that stands up for what is right and upholds the very foundation of this country - one built on the backs of immigrants seeking refuge and the American dream. What voters do not need is a party that caves to their toddler counterparts by gladly handing them the cup they asked for, only to have those same toddlers throw it to the ground because it's blue, not red, and therefore \"not good enough.\"Opinion by Danielle CampoamorTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
