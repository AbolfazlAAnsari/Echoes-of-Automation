There must be a pervasive working culture of ethics and accountability at all levels across the organization. Working agents need to see these high standards at work in their leadership every day.The Justice Department in Washington, D.C.(Xinhua/Liu Jie via Getty Images)Congress must also resume its oversight responsibility. We cannot afford partisan politics to cloud the oversight of this most important institution.Just as we cannot allow the FBI itself to become a partisan tool, we should demand that our elected representatives do their duty and provide the robust and consistent oversight of the FBI’s activities and hold the leaders accountable without political theater.It is important to note that agents all over the country are following the FBI creed of fidelity, bravery and integrity, and risking their lives to make us safer. These agents deserve better and our country deserves better.President Bidenand FBI leadership must recognize this and act now, rather than play politics with the public’s trust."
