Wes Moore joins ‘Fox News Sunday’ to discuss the cleanup and rebuilding efforts for the collapsed Baltimore bridge.TheFrancis Scott Key Bridgewatched over Baltimore City for 52 years.

It also affected the farmer in Kentucky, the auto worker in Michigan and the restaurant owner in Tennessee.This is a national priority, and our national government must respond.In apolitically divided Washington, getting support from both chambers of Congress would require the two parties working together. We recognize that many Americans have grown cynical to the possibility of bipartisanship. In this era of division and vitriol, the very notion of Democrats and Republicans uniting behind a common goal might feel impossible.BALTIMORE BRIDGE COLLAPSE SURVIVOR ‘FOUGHT FOR THIS LIFE’ AFTER CAR PLUNGED INTO RIVERBut the two of us – one a Democrat governor, the other a Republican member of Congress – believe that partnership is possible.
