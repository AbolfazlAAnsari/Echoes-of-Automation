But in an era in which we live so much of our lives online, employees of social media and other tech companies ought to have similar legally mandated reporting responsibilities.Finally, we need to rethink how we use end-to-end encryption, in which only the sender and receiver can access the content of a message or file. While it has valid applications, like banking or medical records, end-to-end encryption can also help people store and share child abuse images. To illustrate just how many abusers could go undetected, consider that out of the 29 million tips the CyberTipline received in 2021, just 160 came from Apple, which maintains end-to-end encryption for iMessages and iCloud.Even if law enforcement has a warrant to access a perpetrator's files, a tech company with end-to-end encryption can claim that it can't access those files and can't help. Surely an industry built on innovation is capable of developing solutions to protect our children -- and making that a priority.AI technology and social media are evolving every day. If lawmakers act now, we can prevent wide-scale harm to kids.Teresa Huizar is CEO ofNational Children's Alliance, America's largest network of care centers for child abuse victims."
