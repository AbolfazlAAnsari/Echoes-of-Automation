(Metadeclined to comment about Zuckerberg's posting decisions.)While celebrity parents do face acuteprivacy and security threats(think invasive paparazzi or kidnapping risks), the centrality of digital interactions in our everyday lives means that all parents must grapple with questions of how the information they create and share might affect their children. And unfortunately, there aren't any one-size-fits-all answers. There's also no guarantee of avoiding tension down the line; even the most thoughtful parent might do something their child one day finds embarrassing, or worse. As the first generation ofpost-Facebook children grow up, some young people are sharingquite emotional responsesto their parents' online postings.For their part, parents have long been considering how to navigate their desire to express themselves and bond with others via social media, while also honoring their children's privacy. A decade ago, a research team and I interviewedmore than 100 parentsabout their social media use. We found that parents took various steps to address their privacy concerns related to posting about their children. These included communicating their posting preferences to family and friends, and creating separate profiles for child-related content, which often contained fewer friends so the content was visible to a smaller audience.Swiss researcher Ulla Autenrieth has identified privacy-protective tacticsspecifically for photos, some of whichZuckerberg has used: putting emojis over children's faces; showing children from behind or in profile; including only parts of children, like their hands or feet, in images; depicting children at a distance; and having children wear sunglasses, costumes or masks that disguise their appearance.As summer vacation season serves up more photo-posting opportunities, here's my advice to parents: Turn posting into a collaborative activity byinvolving your kids in the process. Before each post you want to make, ask how they feel and truly listen to them. If they're happy about posting, great. But if they'd rather not have something posted, don't post it. If sharing the image is important to you, work together to find a solution. Maybe they'd prefer one of the privacy-preserving techniques mentioned above, or perhaps you can message the photo to a few people rather than post it on social media.While babies obviously can't meaningfully contribute to these conversations, by ages 4 to 6, children are developing a sense of their own individuality andcan start to engagewith the idea of your posting. By bringing children into the process and, importantly, honoring their preferences, you're signaling that they have agency in creating their digital footprint and that their perspective matters. Actively deliberating what to post on your account also gives children a model to follow when they're deciding what to post on their own accounts.More broadly, treating posting as a collaborative process can make privacy stewardship feel less fraught. Discussions about parents' social media posting often frame the issue as one of a parent's right to post versus a child's right to privacy, giving the whole topic an antagonistic flavor. Yet posting decisions shouldn't focus on whose right trumps whose, but rather on what's best for the parent-child relationship. That way, if children ever feel tension about parental posting down the line, they'll hopefully feel comfortable sharing their concerns with parents directly. And, since teenagersreport ambivalenceabout the roleof social media in their lives, having a foundation of openness may make it easier for children to seek support or advice from parents about other technology-related issues they face.While privacy stewardship is something each family needs to navigate, let's not forget the reason why these privacy concerns exist in the first place. The platforms Zuckerberg owns - Facebook and Instagram, in particular - have not onlyreplaced the baby book, but they've alsoabsorbedthe family reunion, the newspaper, the marketplace and the town square. That has concentrated a lot of our information and our attentionin one place, all for the purpose of making him wealthy (albeit under the rosy glow ofcloseness and community).So don't call out Zuckerberg the dad for looking out for his children's privacy. But definitely call out Zuckerberg the corporate titan for continuing to profit off our data. That's the realprivacy problem of social media, and it affects children and adults alike.Opinion by Priya C. KumarTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
