DeSantis' quip infuriated theusualMAGA online crowd, including the former presidenthimself. But solely concentrating their rhetorical ire on the legal adventures of the Manhattan district attorney's office, without laying out subtle critiques of Trump, would make it harder for Republicans to then run or endorse other candidates for the 2024 nomination.Successful candidates and parties need to have a compelling story around their campaign. Without making a case, directly or indirectly, for why Trump should not be the presumptive nominee, the narrative of the Republican Party will center around Trump and his adversaries. A response that solely focuses on the sins of prosecutors in New York runs the risk of letting Trump claim the nomination by default.After disappointing midterms in2018and2022, and a lost presidential reelection bid in 2020, Republicans have hopefully learned the downside of putting all their eggs in the MAGA basket. Cementing Trump as the sole figurehead of GOP politics puts future general election victories at risk. But Republican primary voters will be quick to punish any candidates who are too eager to throw Trump under the bus.So if charges are filed, expect a chorus of Republican voices attacking the prosecutorial overreach of a district attorney whopledgedto focus on investigating the former president. But the question of how far some will go to defend Trump in his legal battle may make or break their ability to support other challengers to the Republican nomination in 2024 - and they should choose their words wisely.Opinion by Patrick T.
