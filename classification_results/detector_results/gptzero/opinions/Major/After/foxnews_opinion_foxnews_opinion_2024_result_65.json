Enrollment has declined by more than 50,000 students between 2018 and 2023, and 181 district schools were operating at less than 50% capacity last school year. Douglass High School and Manley High School were 96% and 95% empty, respectively.Local leaders could not close the emptiest schools even if they wanted to. A 2021 state law that was applauded by CTU precludes CPS from closing down any schools until early 2025. A bill has been proposed to extend the moratorium to 2027.Don’t worry about these schools going underused. The CTU is demanding that vacant floors of school buildings be converted into shelters for unaccompanied migrants as part of its new contract, which it is currently negotiating with CPS. The union's $50-billion slate of demands would cost taxpayers, over time, more than triple the amount the mayor proposed for the entire city's budget for 2024.The conversion of school facilities is only one part of a long list of wants, which includes across-the-board raises not tied to performance and lower standards for teacher evaluations.This is far from the first time Chicago students have been kept out of school for political reasons. The city’s public schools did not completely reopen from COVID-19 until late August 2021, a full year after many other districts had successfully brought students back into classrooms. The CTU, an affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers, called reopening efforts \"rooted in sexism, racism, and misogyny\" in a since-deleted tweet.The state of education in Chicago exemplifies what happens when a teachers union runs a city. Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, was hand-picked by the CTU and propelled into office by union dollars. Johnson appointed all but one member of the school board (though the board will switch to a hybrid appointed-elected board in January). Both Mayor Johnson and CTU President Stacy Davis Gates spoke from the main stage at the American Federation of Teachers convention last month.In school, CPS students are unlikely to learn reading and math. Outside of school, they barely stand a chance. But they will learn the sad lesson that, for education bureaucrats and union bosses, learning comes second place to politics.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANGELA MORABITOAngela Morabito is a visiting fellow at the Independent Women’s Forum and the spokesperson for the Defense of Freedom Institute."
