This is hardly a surprise to anyone who has watched American foreign policy over the last 2 ½ years. What I mean is, they have no instinct for looking down the football field and reading the defense. They aren’t trying to stay one step ahead of China, Russia or anybody else.Despite overlapping crises around the world, the Pentagon cannot handle a simple, temporary transfer of authority.How easy it would have been to release a statement before Christmas saying that Secretary Austin would be on medical leave for several days over the holidays while another official assumed his duties. America can’t afford to be so clumsy when China is racing to topple us as a global superpower.Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin remains hospitalized a week after suffering severe pain following an elective procedure related to prostate cancer, the Pentagon shared on Tuesday.(Ian Waldie/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Let me just add, it still looks like Team Biden prefers to hide its national security business from the American people. Remember the giant Chinese spy balloon? Recently, it was revealed that Pentagon officials had discussed the balloon for almost a week before it became news. And they delayed further before an F-22 fighter plane from Virginia finally shot it down off the South Carolina coast on Feb. 4, 2023.Most of Biden’s national security team was chosen for their long-standing connections to Biden dating back to his vice presidency (Austin) and time in theSenate (Blinken). They came into office hoping to put military issues on the back burner and let diplomacy step forward. Then came Afghanistan, Ukraine, Taiwan, Gaza and the Red Sea. Despite all these overlapping crises, the Pentagon cannot handle a simple, temporary transfer of authority.Rhode Island Democrat Sen. Jack Reed, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said this week, \"This lack of disclosure must never happen again.\"I wholeheartedly agree.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REBECCA GRANTDr. Rebecca Grant is vice president of the Lexington Institute."
