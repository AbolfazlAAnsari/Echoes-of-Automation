The resilience of the pioneers and businessmen and their sense of collective purpose drove Vancouver's rapid recovery. The Vancouver Daily resumed publishing just three days after the fire, expressing optimism for the city's restoration despite individual hardships.In our own era, the town of Lytton suffered similar devastation, losing 90 per cent of its buildings to conflagration in June 2021. The provincial government was quick to offer support to the town's population of 250, raising hopes for government assistance. Premier John Horgan(https://globalnews.ca/news/8007239/bc-wildfire-update-live-july-6-2021/) pledged help for Lytton's reconstruction, promising it would be a \"case study\" on community rebuilding - which it has been, though not in the sense Horgan intended.As months have turned into years, redemption of the pledges made to Lytton has remained elusive. Two years after the fire, rebuilding had not started - indeed, not a single building permit had been issued. It was not until the end of 2023(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oldG14mzBow) that the first home re-builds began. Construction of a new municipal building still hasn't started, and it is not expected to be ready until late 2025(https://lytton.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Recovery-update-Lytton-Town-Hall-Jan-18-2023.pdf), more than four years after the fire. The blame certainly does not lie with the residents of Lytton - it is our growing dependence on government in all forms that leads to such outcomes.Yes, there were many fewer regulations for re-builders to worry about in 1886 and key infrastructure, such as sewer, water, and electricity, had not yet been established. Even so, it is unacceptable that Lytton, could not issue a single building permit until two years after the fire. One former Lytton resident received a $22,000 quote(https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/lytton-residents-rally-to-protest-delays-rebuilding) for provincially mandated archaeological services - just so she could dig a water and sewer line trench for her house.A \"state of local emergency order\" preventing property-owners from accessing their land was renewed 100 times over two years(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lytton-state-of-local-emergency-to-end -1.6877479 ), effectively stalling re-building. Government officials have insisted on \"world-class(https://vancouversun.com/opinion/vaughn-palmer-two-years-after-lytton-burned-not-a-single-building-permit-has-been-issued)\" environmental standards, which they could then showcase - even though most Lytton residents simply wanted a livable area in which to rebuild their homes and lives.The stories of Vancouver after 1886 and Lytton since 2021 underscore a fundamental truth: governments play a vital role in disaster response, but they cannot and should not replace the resourcefulness of individuals and communities. Driven by its residents and local businesses, 19th-century Vancouver responded swiftly to the Great Fire. In contrast, 21st-century Lytton's most daunting challenges have been bureaucratic delay and regulatory burden.Opinion: The dirty, but not so little secrets of the federal carbon tax(https://financialpost.com/opinion/federal-carbon-tax-dirty-secrets)Philip Cross: Last-gasp defence can't save the carbon tax(https://financialpost.com/opinion/last-gasp-defence-cant-save-carbon-tax)Terence Corcoran: After the carbon tax, axe Ottawa's tree plan(https://financialpost.com/opinion/after-carbon-tax-axe-ottawa-tree-plan)This tale of two Vancouver towns teaches that governments must recognize and support the capacity of individuals and communities to lead their own recovery efforts, while providing resources and removing bureaucratic obstacles. Empowering individuals and communities to take ownership of their destinies is essential for building resilience against natural disasters.Jerome Gessaroli, a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, leads the Sound Economic Policy Project at the British Columbia Institute of Technology. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2024 Postmedia Network Inc.
