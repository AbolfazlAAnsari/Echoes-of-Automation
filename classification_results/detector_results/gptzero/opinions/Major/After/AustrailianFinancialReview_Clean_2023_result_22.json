It took much more aggressive monetary tightening because inflation expectations ratcheted up over time. Prices and wages rose too much.Today, there are key differences. Central banks are generally independent of governments and have official inflation targets. Hence, Goolsbee says something different may be going on because central bank credibility can keep inflation expectations anchored.Local inflation expectations have jumped in the short term due largely to high petrol prices, but the more important medium-term inflation expectations that the RBA watches remain well anchored.But Goolsbee says this cannot be taken for granted, as the anchoring \"hinges on a belief in the inflation-fighting credibility of the Fed. In turn, appropriate monetary policy actions and communications aimed at hitting our inflation target reinforce credibility, anchor inflation expectations, and support the effectiveness of monetary policy.\"That's why it is crucial that the Reserve Bank is seen to maintain independence from the government and makes good decisions on monetary policy to convince the public it will get inflation under control. This includes difficult decisions on interest rates that are unpopular with politicians and the public.The RBA board faces a big decision next Tuesday. Its dilemma is that while the economy is slowing, inflation is proving more stubborn than hoped. Governor Michele Bullock has indicated the key question is whether the upside surprise to September quarter inflation equates to a \"material\" change to the outlook for future inflation and jeopardises the RBA's already-patient timeline to get inflation back under 3 per cent by late 2025.Treasurer Jim Chalmers said last week the rise in quarterly inflation did not amount to a \"material\" change to Treasury's inflation outlook. Was Chalmers jawboning the RBA, or politically distancing himself from a potential RBA rate rise?One subtlety is that Treasury forecasts headline inflation, whereas the RBA focuses more on underlying inflation known as the trimmed mean, which strips out volatile prices such as for petrol. Underlying inflation of 1.2 per cent for the September quarter was notably above the RBA's implied forecast of 0.9 per cent, due to sticky prices for services and non-tradeable goods.Economists and traders in money markets are betting inflation will force the RBA board to raise the 4.1 per cent cash rate.Chalmers would obviously prefer no rate rise. But his public statement last week could make a rate rise more likely to demonstrate that the RBA is operating at arm's length from the government and to avoid perceptions that the bank's \"new\" board is dovish on inflation.The RBA has a new governor, is missing a deputy governor (to be appointed by Chalmers) and has two new members with trade union backgrounds appointed by Chalmers. Ironically, it could be in his best economic and political interest to get it out of the way. If the board thinks a rate rise is warranted, it is better to do it sooner rather than later. The later a central bank raises rates, the more likely it will subsequently have to raise them even higher later to quell inflation and inflation expectations.In the US, the Fed appears to be benefiting from aggressively front-loading its interest rate rises to the current target rate range of 5.25 per cent to 5.5 per cent. Its preferred measure of underlying inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, has eased to 3.7 per cent.In Australia, trimmed mean inflation is higher at 5.2 per cent. The RBA has been more cautious than the Fed because local inflation and wages did not peak as high.Moreover, Chalmers' budget has been broadly neutral compared with the irresponsible and highly stimulatory US fiscal budget deficit of an astounding 6 per cent of GDP at a time of full employment.RBA cash rate changes also transmit quicker to households because of variable rate mortgages. But as former RBA assistant governor Luci Ellis, now Westpac's chief economist, has noted, \"Monetary policy works through more channels than the effects on the cash flows of households with mortgages. This effect does come through a bit faster here in Australia ... but it does not mean that monetary policy is more powerful overall here than elsewhere.\"The other channels, as noted by RBA assistant governor Chris Kent, are the asset-price, credit, exchange rate and the savings-investment channels.On the balance of evidence, a rate rise looks likely next Tuesday. If the RBA instead holds rates steady, it will need to craft a very convincing story to maintain its inflation-fighting credibility.John Kehoe is economics editor of The Australian Financial Review."
