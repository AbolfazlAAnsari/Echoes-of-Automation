            "inputText": "(CNN) &#8212; Here's a bit of mind-blowing data: The number of self-identified independent voters hit a recordhigh of 49%in a March 2023 Gallup poll - meaning that there are essentially as many self-identified independent voters in the United States as Democrats and Republicans combined. And in 2022, therewere nine stateswhere registered independent voters outnumbered Democrats or Republicans.We spend a lot of time dividing American politics into a bitter, zero-sum struggle between Democrats and Republicans. That's definitely true in Washington, DC, but it misses the reality that political beliefs are a lot more nuanced in most people's lives.In fact, if you put aside the play-to-the-base horserace polls and pay attention to actual election results, you'll see that independent votersultimately decidewho wins major American elections. And the number of independent votershas grownprecisely as the two parties have become more polarized over the last 15 years.What's far less established is the wisdom of running a third-party bipartisan ticket for president - with an eye toward appealing to those independent voters - especially when former President Donald Trump, now aleading GOP presidential primary contender, could be the unintended beneficiary of that effort.That potential is driving theincreasingly heated debatearound a possible third-party presidential run by the organization No Labels, which I helped co-found in 2010 as part of a bipartisan group trying to depolarize our politics (though I haven't been involved since 2013).Controversy and confusion abound around these two entwined topics, so let's define our terms.Independent voters are the subject of endless debate in political circles. Some beltway analysts deny their existence, arguing that they are not really independent but closeted partisans who lean one way or another. But around election time, some of those same voices will focus on independent voters as the essential bloc to win - which has the added advantage of being true.This is clear in presidential years. For example, in 2016, TrumpedgedDemocratic candidate Hillary Clinton by four points among independents, according to CNN exit polls. In 2020, BidenbeatTrump among independent voters by a 13-point margin.But it's also true in midterm elections, where independent voters provide the swing needed to shift control of the House. In 2006, after former President George W. Bush's Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina mishaps, independentsswung to the Democratsby 18 points - making Democrat Nancy Pelosi the first female Speaker of the House. In the post-Obama Tea Party year of 2010, Republicanswon independentsby 19 points and returned to power. And, in 2018, bolstered by a rejection of Trump,independents swung backto Democrats by 12 points, giving them a large majority in the next congressional session.But this is where things get really interesting, and we start to skate toward the current state of play. In 2022, Democratsdefied recent pendulum swing precedent(and many pre-election polls) by narrowly winning independent voters by two points. It appears that independent voters punished the GOP's continued embrace of Trump, hisshambolic handpicked candidates(paging Georgia's Herschel Walker) and theoverturning of abortion rightsafter a half-century of precedent.Which brings us to the question, what do independent voters believe? Contrary to the polarized perception of politics, many - if not most - Americans have political beliefs thatdo not reflectone party orthodoxy (and, as we've seen with Trump's hijacking of the GOP, party beliefs can change as well). I've focused on independent voters and centrist politics for the better part of two decades, beginning with my first book, \"Independent Nation,\" so let me help clear up some myths.It is true that independent voters are not a monolith. Some independent voters are on the far right and someare on the far left, dissatisfied with the Republican or Democratic Party because they are not extreme enough. But the majority are in the middle - and independent votersare more likely to describethemselves as moderate than either Democrats or Republicans.Their political beliefs don't fit neatly inside either major party. But theycan broadly be describedas fiscally responsible, socially liberal and strong on national security, as I explained in a 2008 Wall Street Journal column. Subsequent analysis of independent voters, done by Pew Research Center in 2019, shows that even as the nation has become more polarized, theyhave maintainedmany of their same moderate positions.They are primarily frustrated by the inability of the two parties to find common ground on policy issues - such asgun reformandimmigration reform- where the polls show the parties are more divided than the American people are.That's the good news: Weare not as dividedas we think we are. And that's what No Labels is trying to hammer home with a newly released 67-page policy booklet called \"Common Sense,\" in which the organization delineates broad compromise proposals that could emerge if a commonsense majority of Americans were actually empowered to run our politics.It's easy to dismiss this all as pie in the sky, but that would be a mistake. For example, the booklet details what a grand bargain on immigration could look like - being tougher on border enforcement, while seeking a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and making it easier to have legal immigration so our economy continues to thrive.This is not particularly controversial; it just doesn't reflect special interest-driven ideological absolutism on either side of the aisle - which is part of why immigration reform, for example, has been stalled for decades.But it needs to be said that President Joe Bidenhas proposedjust this kind of a balanced deal in his most recent State of the Union. And that's where the fundamental problem about asymmetric polarization becomes really important - and a critical hurdle to No Labels' efforts.In Biden's first two years, more than 300 pieces of bipartisan legislationwere passed, including landmark laws like theInfrastructure Investment and Job Actand theCHIPS and Science Act, both major economic drivers for the country. In fact, the Problems Solvers Caucus in Congress,which was created, in part, thanks to No Labels, actually was instrumental in getting many of these bills passed.No Labels' Achilles heel in this presidential effort is that it seems to treat Biden and Trump as equally polarizing. While a Trump and Biden rematch would no doubt be unpopular with many Americans, to say that Biden and Trump represent equal threats to the republic does not reflect reality. Only one of them triedto overturn an election by liesto protect his ego. And only one partyseems likely to renominatesomeone who's been indicted at least twice.I have no problem with the policies being put forward by No Labels, nor do I disagree with many of thesentiments expressedat their recent town hall event in New Hampshire featuring Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and former Republican Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman.They're absolutely right in pointing out that the twisted incentive structure of partisan politics has pushed our country to the brink. To the extent that No Labels can provide some muscle in the middle of our politics, it could represent the hopes of many independent voters who feel politically homeless across the political spectrum. And creating ballot access to seed a third party in solid red or blue states could help give voters an alternative choice on a statewide level, which would help heal our divisions on a microlevel down the line.But the Electoral College mathematics of presidential elections suggest that a key way a figure like Trump - whoremains deeply unpopularwith the American people at large - could be reelected is if a third-party candidate plays spoiler. Even Republican senatorsare now warningthat a No Labels ticket led by Manchin would hurt Biden and help Trump. That is an extraordinarily reckless risk at this particular time in our history.There are concrete examples of this spoiler effect in our recent history. Consider Ralph Nader's 2000 Green Party candidacygetting over 97,000 votesin Florida, a state thatBush won by 537 votes and, as a result, the presidency. Or 2016, when Jill Stein and Gary Johnson's third-party campaignsarguably had a similar effectin that tight election, which also helps explain why GOP-backed operativesbolsteredKanye West's absurd and aborted 2020 campaign, seemingly designed to siphon off Black votes from Democrats.We are many moves away from the general election, and No Labels says it will pull the plug on its effort if it looks like the organization might unintentionally elect Trump. But, in general, independent voters want less polarization - and even the possibility of a Trump reelection promises to pour gasoline on the hyperpartisan firesthat threatento burn down our republic.Opinion by John AvlonTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
