They’re not all white male test pilots, now they’re women and they’re people of color and they’re PhDs and they’re medical doctors and they’re scientists.  It’s faces just like your faces. The faces of America.\"The NASA logo is seen at its headquarters in Washington, D.C., on June 7, 2022.((Photo by STEFANI REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images))Newsflash to Nelson and the far-left AP: Women, people of color, PhDs, and medical doctors have been astronauts since 1978 when NASA appointed the first six women to its astronaut corps.  Sally Ride became the first American woman to fly in space in June of 1983. Two months later, Guion Bluford made history on August 30, 1983, when he became the first African American in space.Why all the identity politics now?CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONNASA is hoping to return to the moon with its Artemis III launch most likely in 2026 at the earliest. The Orion spacecraft for that mission will house four astronauts.  All four should be there because they are the best of the best.If the top four of the U.S. Astronaut corps -- in terms of experience, proficiency, and judgment -- are women, then those four women should be the crew for Artemis.  Period.NASA keeps stressing it wants to reach those who are \"Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color\" as well as \"lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons.\"Again, if anyone from any one of those communities is the best of the best, they should be hired immediately.  That said, they should not be hired over a much more qualified candidate simply because NASA is seeking to check an identity politics box.Human space travel is incredibly complicated, dangerous, and unforgiving.  In real life, achievement based upon merit must still matter when lives are at stake.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DOUGLAS MACKINNONDouglas MacKinnon is a former White House and Pentagon official and author of the book:\"The 56 – Liberty Lessons from those who risked all to sign The Declaration of Independence.\"Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
