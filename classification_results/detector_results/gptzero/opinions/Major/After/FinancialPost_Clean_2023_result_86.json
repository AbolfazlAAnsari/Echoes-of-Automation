            "inputText": "U.S. President Joe Biden recently delivered a blunt message to Israel:(https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/opinion/netanyahu-israel-judiciary.html) Israel has to work out its internal difficulties by \"consensus,\" or it risks having Biden as the last pro-Israeli Democratic president. But one thing was missing from this dire warning: not a word was said about the substance of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposals. That's because those reforms are not a call for revolution, but rather a sensible response to an Israeli judicial system that has more power than nearly any other judiciary in the Western world.The immediate cause for Tuesday's \"Day of Disruption\" came largely in response to a bill in the Knesset that would curtail the Israeli Supreme Court's use of a roving \"reasonableness\" standard to evaluate government political appointments and executive decisions. But this standard - which gives the court immense power to strike down national policy on its own judgment - is profoundly out of step with every known western norm, which takes the exact opposite view of judicial power.On appointments, the United States Supreme Court, for instance, cannot bar Pete Buttigieg or Ben Carson from serving in the government's cabinet because the Court finds the appointments \"unreasonable.\" On substance, the U.S. Secretary of State, a political appointee, can unilaterally block the courts from hearing cases brought against sovereigns like Saudi Arabia and entities like OPEC on antitrust issues, which often overlap with human rights issues.Indeed, the Biden administration itself long determined it can use executive power to protect the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman from prosecution in the U.S. for the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Contrast this approach with the Israeli Supreme Court which can and has struck down both cabinet appointments(https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-bombshell-ruling-high-court-nixes-shas-head-deri-from-serving-as-minister/ ) and enormously significant energy deals(https://www.timesofisrael.com/high-court-torpedoes-massive-gas-deal-in-historic-ruling/ ) on its own judicially-created standards.Biden's message is rich in unintended ironies. Any Israeli consensus is a de facto call to keep the status quo on all matters pertaining to judicial reform. But on American domestic policy, major legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act is passed without a single Republican vote, executive orders are regularly employed, and the Supreme Court criticized when it strikes down his ukase.The Israeli justices have become a law unto themselves, not the interpreters of laws drafted by the political branches of government. The Court has even arrogated to itself the right to determine whom the state awards its highest honors to - in one case, ordering the nation's Israel Prize be awarded(https://www.timesofisrael.com/high-court-rules-israel-prize-must-be-given-to-professor-accused-of-bds-support/ ) to an academic the government says supported BDS. Imagine U.S. Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Samuel Alito deciding whom to honor at the next State of the Union.Intermittent interventions by courts create messes that elected officials will find difficult to correct. Thus, virtually everywhere these political questions are institutionally kept from the courts. As stated in American jurisprudence, the constant fear is that judges who have no subject matter expertise pose a real danger to the political branches when they seek to resolve these delicate issues.It's ironic because, at least in the American context, progressives are the biggest champions of administrative and political decisions and have been quick to decry what they see as an activist, conservative court striking down laws and regulations where they have no business or expertise doing so. Many Democrats, including President Biden, have entertained making fundamental changes to the size and jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court - plans known as \"court packing.\" They have a double standard when they turn to Israel.The protesters and their leaders never explain why Israel should remain a global outlier. Instead, they throw a tantrum intended to disrupt the deliberative processes of a democratic government. The intensity of their preferences are meant to drown out any serious substantive discussions, and their explicit threats to economic and national security are a powerful veto over any action. Trying to decide whether to resist these threats or beat an unhappy strategic retreat puts the government in the position of a store owner who has to decide whether to pay protection to the Mafia or risk vandalism to his store.Vivian Bercovici: Netanyahu's judicial reforms are unravelling the unity of Israeli society(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/netanyahus-judicial-reforms-are-unravelling-the-very-fabric-of-israeli-society)Jesse Kline: Netanyahu's judicial reforms don't justify the opposition inflaming the mob(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/netanyahus-judicial-reforms-dont-justify-the-opposition-inflaming-the-mob)And why the crisis now? Because the protesters know that their political power is ebbing. What is most upsetting to the protestors is not any particular proposal on the table, but their loss of influence and control. Israel has become more religious(https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/culture/article-726394) and less white(https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-746054) since its founding and the ruling elites there are not happy about either situation. But the same Joe Biden who favors diversity in the U.S. is loath to let the Israeli government and courts reflect the values of their citizenry, and Israel now risks becoming ruled by out-of-touch WASPs (that's White Ashkenazic Supporters of Peace).There is no question that these reforms could set back economic progress in the short term because of the self-inflicted wounds caused by the protests. Worse still, the threat to draw military reservists into the fray could compromise national security. Just think how it would look in the United States if tomorrow many Republicans were to go on strike in objection to Joe Biden's recent criticisms of the American Supreme Court - or if Democrats would not show up to military service to protest Donald Trump's tax cuts.Brinkmanship never pays, and in the long-run, good policy wins out. Investors will continue to pour money into Israel because they understand that these changes are necessary to rein in a judicial system that has, among other faults, led Israel's level of contract enforcement to rank between South Sudan and Samoa.(https://archive.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploretopics/enforcing-contracts)Acts of civil disobedience should be reserved for only the direst of circumstances: vandalism, the harassment of public officials, the closing down of major public transportation, the disruption of Knesset proceedings, and the threats of military insubordination should not be the first response to reasoned public debate. By castigating these rather measured reforms, such as preventing judges from appointing their own successors, the protesters engage in behaviors that they would denounce were the shoe on the other foot. Pity that they and their too numerous supporters fail to see that they are holding a lit match next to a political powder keg.Richard A.
