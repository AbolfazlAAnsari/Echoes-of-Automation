I was honored when he provided a generous blurb for my 2014 biography of civil rights activist turned Black Power revolutionaryStokely Carmichael(later Kwame Ture). Every time I saw Tree, he showed an interest in what I was doing and extended invitations to events and happenings he was engaged in. He served as a role model for three generations of Black social justice advocates in ways that would have madeDerrick Bell, one of his mentors, proud.The timing of Ogletree's death-on August 4, former President Barack Obama's birthday-is especially significant, given that, as one of Harvard University Law School's pioneering Black faculty, hetaught Michelle and Barack Obamaduring their respective time in law school. Ogletree continued to serve as a friend and mentor to the Obamas in their post-Harvard careers, and those of others. \"On campus, people would always talk about this Professor Ogletree and how supportive he was,\"wrote the former president. Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman on the Supreme Court,counted Ogletreeas one of her most important and impactful mentors, someone who \"inspired legions of students to seek to improve our criminal justice system and make our world a better place.\"Henry Louis Gates Jr., the renowned Harvard University Black Studies scholar,remembered his friendTree as \"a master of the art and science of fishing,\" which they spent much time enjoying together on Martha's Vineyard.In 1991, Ogletree served asAnita Hill's attorneyduring the contentious Supreme Court hearings of Clarence Thomas. Hill's courageous effort to expose the workplace sexual harassments she allegedly received as a colleague of Thomas' in the early 1980s paved the way for the Me Too movement. (Thomas denied all wrongdoing.)In 2003, Ogletree was part of the legal team that sued for reparations for survivors of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre that has recently, in light of the death of George Floyd, become a national touchstone for confronting generation legacies of slavery and racial violence. Although the case was thrown out, it anticipated and amplified our contemporary national conversation around reparations for slavery and racial injustice.Tree publicly announced his Alzheimer's diagnosis in2016, the year after learning of it. Many of the people who knew him cried then, as they do now. A federal courthouse in his hometown of Merced, California, has beennamed in his honor. As has aCharles Ogletree Humanitarian Awardinaugurated by the men's basketball team at Harvard, organized by his good friend and head coach Tommy Amaker. The tributes and recognition will continue as they should.But Tree's biggest legacy reverberates in the thousands of lives he touched, including mine. In so many ways, he served as an ambassador for generations of scholar-activists - in Black Studies, history, political science and other disciplines. We taught his work and felt comforted knowing that such a knowledgeable, strategic and empathetic man was in the world fighting the good fight.Charles Ogletree stood at the center of a web of interconnected friendships, professional relationships and discerning inquiry all bound together by his personal sincerity, political integrity and unapologetic love for Black people. He is truly one of the most extraordinary people to have ever lived, and I count myself both fortunate and honored to have considered him not only a mentor but also a friend.Opinion by Peniel E.
