Melgen was involved in a billing dispute with Medicare, and Senator Menendez allegedly used his staff to try to advocate on Melgen’s behalf, among other favors for Melgen.That case resulted in a hung jury after Sen. Menendez emphasized in his defense that he had a longtime genuine friendship with Melgen, and then decoupled Melgen’s largesse from his official actions – \"just friends helping friends,\" went the defense theme.The present case involves several significant differences from the Melgen matter: Sen. Menendez does not have a longtime friendship with Hana, et al.; the official actions he took on their behalf werefar more consequential; and the items of value he received from them were far more scandalous than the vacations he took with his pal Dr. Melgen.Bottom line: It will be difficult for him to prevail with the same playbook this time around.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SCOTT A.
