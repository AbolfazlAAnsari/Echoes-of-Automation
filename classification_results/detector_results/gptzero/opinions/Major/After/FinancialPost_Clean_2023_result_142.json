            "inputText": "In a new book on the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) infiltration of Canada over the last 40 years, intelligence expert Scott McGregor and researcher and filmmaker Ina Mitchell reveal how a bizarre statement by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau helped unveil a hidden war for the hearts, minds and votes of Canadians, fought through a covert web of CCP influence in Canada linking NGOs, businesses and political donations to politicians at the highest levels.By April 2013, Justin Trudeau had won the Liberal leadership in a landslide. Seven months later, when asked during a public appearance which country he most admired, he said, \"There's a level of admiration I actually have for China. Their basic dictatorship is actually allowing them to turn their economy around on a dime.\"Was this bizarre statement a trial balloon meant to test the tolerance of the Canadian public? Or was Trudeau attempting to send a message to the CCP?When Trudeau was elected prime minister in November 2015, concerns were already being raised in the intelligence community about the apparent ease with which the CCP had been able to infiltrate Canada. Members from our research team that are part of law enforcement and intelligence circles started to ask questions. Who was helping the CCP advance their agenda? And, more importantly, what shape did that agenda take?The United Front (an agency of the CCP that builds alliances, influence and co-opts groups and individuals in support of the CCP's goals) often operates behind interconnected layers of NGOs, business associations and companies like law firms. On the face of it, these entities stand alone as real services, but when linked together, they form a complex web providing cover for the CCP to conduct operations in Canada. They're also a way for pro-CCP candidates to run for office and hide big-money donations used to influence policy - so-called cash-for-access or pay-to-play schemes. We untangled one of these intricate webs to show how the CCP has been able to infiltrate and influence the highest levels of Canadian government.The Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation is an independent charity established in 2001, thanks in part to a $125-million contribution from the federal government. Justin Trudeau was a member but withdrew from the foundation's affairs in 2014 under the pressure of an ethics probe. Alexandre (Sacha) Trudeau remained on the board, as the designate of the Pierre Trudeau estate.In 2016, two Chinese billionaires, Zhang Bin and Niu Gensheng, donated $1 million to the Trudeau Foundation and the University of Montreal. While the bulk of the donation - $750,000 - went to the university's law school, the remaining $250,000 was for the foundation and included funds to build a statue honouring Pierre Elliott Trudeau. This donation raised eyebrows because it came less than two weeks after Zhang and Niu met Justin Trudeau at a private $1,500-a-plate Liberal fundraiser. \"The fact that a significant portion of the funding is going to a statue of the prime minister's father does raise some concerns,\" China expert Charles Burton told the Globe and Mail. \"I'm sure, on an emotional level, Mr. Trudeau would be pleased to see a statue of his father, and (that) would incline him to feel well-disposed to those who arranged it.\"Zhang Bin is not just a billionaire businessman but also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body to the CCP. The Globe article also called him \"a force for the spread of Chinese influence\" through his work with the China Cultural Industry Association, a group that includes \"senior figures in the People's Liberation Army, and navy and Communist party bosses.\" He also heads the China Charity Alliance, which reports to China's Civil Affairs Ministry, according to the Globe.Also present at the fundraising dinner were several Communist government officials and banking and insurance magnate Shenglin Xian. At the time, he was waiting on Ottawa's approval to open a bank, called Wealth One, for Chinese-Canadian clients. That approval was given just two months later. \"Certainly, there is an overall strategy on the part of the government of China to try to gain influence (with) critical Canadian decision-makers, \"Charles Burton noted.\" It's part of an overall co-ordinated strategy to try to enhance influence here.\"This part of the story was well covered in the Canadian press, but we kept digging and unearthed even more concerning connections. One thread led us to Ouyang Yuansen, honorary president of the Huazhu Overseas Chinese Service Centre, a Toronto-based United Front organization, and also a founding shareholder of Wealth One Bank of Canada. One of his partners there is Morris Chen, the president of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT). CCPIT is a global organization that develops business relationships and exchanges with foreign countries, and it has long been associated with the United Front network.What was in front of us were data points that showed multiple over-lapping connections between billionaire tycoons, people associated with the CCP and Canada's highest-ranking politician. The prime minister either doesn't realize or doesn't care that the people he's accepting money from - for the Liberal party or his own family foundation - are connected to the Communist party at the highest levels, and some are even known United Front members. He has made decisions as PM that suggest a too cozy relationship with China; abstaining from the Uyghur genocide vote in 2021 is just one obvious example of that.While the world watched on Feb. 1, 2023, the PM was part of a historic vote of 322-0 in favour of Liberal MP Sameer Zuberi's private member's bill to resettle up to 10,000 Uyghur refugees in Canada - an initiative spearheaded by the World Uyghur Congress, headed in Canada by Mehmet Tohti. Worth noting is the only MP who did not vote for the resolution was MP Han Dong, who slipped out just before the vote. What else might he be doing to curry favour? This is an open question with all Canadian politicians, but so far there have been no clear answers.Meanwhile, Canadians had another pressing question in mind when the entire board of directors and the president and CEO of the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation resigned, citing \"politicization\" of the scholarship organization. Was a $200,000 deal that Sacha signed with Chinese billionaire Zhang Bin years ago a backdoor attempt to influence his brother, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau? Or is there more to the story? Sacha stood his ground, reportedly telling a parliamentary committee,\" We're wasting our time on the notion of interference. I have seen no trace of it.\"What the Operation Dragon Lord document (a 1999 classified U.S. intelligence report detailing an American operation to monitor the CCP threat in Canada) did for Canada is provide us with the inflection point when the ground under Canada shifted. The point when the Chinese Communist Party invaded Canada, albeit silently, and launched a hybrid war against the West.Canadians now had the benefit of hindsight and could see signs that Canada's political establishment and civil society had been infiltrated. Canadians were now starting to take notice, ask questions and demand answers.The CCP would fight back aggressively, using backchannels aimed at censorship, propaganda and disinformation meant to control narratives.Ottawa's push to regulate online content with Bill C-11, An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act, was just one response to this.Another was the 2023 federal Liberal party policy resolution, sponsored by the B.C. wing of the party, that would call on the government to combat disinformation in Canada.The policy stated that disinformation is an \"existential risk to humanity\" that required government censorship when it came to \"material published on (media) platforms and to limit publication only to material whose sources can be traced.\" The policy sounded like it was straight from the usual talking points that spokespersons for the Chinese Communist Party have made against Canadian media many times over.Responding to allegations of election interference, the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Ottawa remarked, on its website, that, \"Some Canadian politicians and media patched up false reports and spread all kinds of disinformation,\" and that, \"These actions seriously deceived and misled the public, poisoning the atmosphere of China-Canada relations.\"Was it a coincidence that the new east-west United Front strategy in Canada was calling for the establishment of a nationwide communication system? We know for certain that the leveraging of media to influence information and alter public sentiment in Canada is part of hybrid warfare. We could already see signs of efforts being made to alter public sentiment in Sacha Trudeau's book, \"Barbarian Lost,\" where he writes, \"Yes, I still occasionally defend the CCP; for one I don't think China could've come so far so quickly without the unity and organizational power it has provided.\"Indeed, one has to hand it to the CCP. Through ingenious methods and remarkable feats of social control, the CCP has pursued a system of broad outreach and constant surveillance, keeping its citizens and the global community of overseas Chinese feeling connected or beholden to the motherland, or both. Like a strict parent that has cultivated an air of benevolence, the CCP instills fear and loyalty in its citizens and maintains control over its diasporic communities around the globe, while also buying silence or support from politicians in countries where it establishes itself as a secondary cultural presence, always striving to become primary. Canada is only one site among many in this hybrid war against the West. But it is an important one.Excerpted from \"The Mosaic Effect: How China Started a Hybrid War in America's Backyard,\" with permission from Optimum Publishing International.
