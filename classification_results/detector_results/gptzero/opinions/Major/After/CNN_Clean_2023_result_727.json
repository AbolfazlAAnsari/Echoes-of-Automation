The premise of the letter is that the administration's request comes without clear answers to questions about Ukraine's progress in the war, our own strategy and endgame in the ongoing conflict and how existing dollars that Congress has appropriated for the war effort have been spent.These are fair questions that deserve thorough consideration and fulsome debate - which is why House Speaker Kevin McCarthy should consider the administration's request separately from the ongoing discussions over a potential government shutdown. Indeed, the inquiries in the GOP letter are valid and should not be dismissed as an expected reaction of a group of hard-right Republicans to a Biden administration priority as we approach an election year. They reflect the misgivings and doubt amongst many voters across the country - particularly Republicans - about continuing to send resources to Ukraine.While there are likely many reasons for these misgivings, the principal among them seems to be a lack of understanding around two key issues. The first is why continuing support is important to American national interests and second, what the endpoint of our commitment there will be, particularly given theuncertaintyabout Ukraine's own prospects for success in the fight against Russia, which could drag on for years.Some of the blame lies with Ukrainian leadership for a failure to clearly communicate their own plans andtransparently accountfor where existing US aid has been deployed.

If one of these candidates were to become the nominee of the Republican Party (an admittedly unlikely scenariogiven thecurrent polling), his or her view would become the de facto position of the party going into next year's election and potentially beyond. This view would also be backed by Senate Republican leadership and a healthy number of Republican members in both houses of Congress who have voiced their support for Ukraine.So far, the skirmishes between the GOP contenders have framed Ukraine as a wedge issue that differentiates Trump from other candidates like Haley, Pence or Christie. Less time has been spent on the campaign trail explaining to voters why support for Ukraine is crucial to our national interests.Given the sharp divides among GOP policymakers and leaders over the question of US assistance for Ukraine, it seems increasingly unlikely, barring a significant development in the war, that Republican voter opinions will shift so dramatically as to favor robust and sustained American involvement. Nonetheless, it's up to Haley, Pence and Christie to make the case. They may be the only hope for Zelensky - and those here in America who wish to see continued support for Ukraine - to change the minds of Republican voters and, by extension, policymakers who have soured on all we are doing to help Kyiv win the war.Opinion by Lanhee J.
