And so, on 15 June 1972, the international community voted to establish the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) headquartered in Kenya.Fast-forward half a century, and in November this year, the world will descend on UNEP’s Nairobi offices for INC-3 – the third meeting of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop an international treaty on plastic pollution. The talks take place in a world that produces nearly 10 times more plastic than it did at UNEP’s founding in Stockholm.UN member states made concrete progress in the form of agreeing a mandate for INC chair Gustavo Adolfo Meza-Cuadra Velasquez to prepare a first version of the treaty text, known as the Zero Draft ahead of November’s Nairobi talks. Senor Velasquez – a career diplomat with 30 years in Peru’s foreign service – has the mammoth task of building consensus around a draft from countries with a varying set of wants and needs.Theworld’s small islanddeveloping states are relying on the INC chair to deliver a zero draft of the treaty that will address the profound challenges they face. Idyllic islands such as Maldives, Grenada, and Palau contribute little to the global plastic problem. But they are faced with a deluge of plastic pollution that washes up on their pristine white beaches. This in turn threatens the tourist trade they rely on.Senor Velasquez should deliver a zero draft treaty that will cap and rapidly phase down plastic production, ban or severely restrict single-use plastic, mandate reductions in the chemical complexity of plastic, and require global standards for extended producer responsibility (EPR). EPR is a regulatory system where the polluter pays for the full cost of the pollution created by their product. It will also have to deal with the transboundary nature of plastic pollution and make provisions for legal recourse to manage legacy plastic in the ocean.A robust treaty will also have to address pollution from abandoned fishing gear, known as “ghost gear”. The treaty should also tacklehigh levels of plastic wastegenerated by global tourism and support small island states in developing effective waste management solutions. These solutions should be funded by plastic producers who are in a much stronger financial position than small island states themselves.The entire international community will benefit from a treaty that protects some of the world’s most vulnerable countries. If the world can deliver for the countries with the most complex challenges, this will maximise the chance of addressing the plastic crisis in all UN member states.At UNEP headquarters in Nairobi, the world has an opportunity to deliver a draft that affords these beautiful countries long-term protection from the global plastics problem.Jo RoyleCEO ofCommon SeasAI will improve educationArtificial intelligence(AI) provides an opportunity to turn sitting exams from non-learning assessments to, at least partly, summative assessments. This would givepupils the opportunityto learn from their mistakes; the AI could show what they had got wrong and also provide feedback on what a correct answer should look like. This may be useful if they move on tofurther or higher education.  The same approach could be used at GCSE.Dr Mike ScottNorthallOur next step in evolutionAlthough our government and the rest of the world seem to be ignoring the growing adverse effects of climate change, it seems thatJust Stop Oil, Greenpeace, Extinction Rebellion, and other pressure groups, are wrong to becritical of this ignorance.  If they don’t do, or say anything, who will? Or is it that homo sapiens wishes to evolve into homo stupidus?John LakerMarlowPay and pensions – what am I missing?Leaving aside the rights or wrongs of thepensiontriple lock, could someone please explain how aprobable 8 per cent increasenext year, following a 10 per cent increase this year to pensions, that benefit a mainly Conservative voting section of society, isn’t inflationary – while similar pay rises forpublic sector employeeswho mainly vote Labour apparently would be?Am I missing something here?Stephen LawrenceEnfield"
