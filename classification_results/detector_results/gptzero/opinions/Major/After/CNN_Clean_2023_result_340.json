Republicans had control of both Congress and the White House, but a government shutdown came because of a budget impasse with the debt ceiling looming in the distance. House Speaker Paul Ryanrelied on the votesof 73 moderate House Democrats to pass the plan, while losing 67 of the most conservative Republicans.For all our deep polarization, when America's back is against the wall, Republican leadership has depended on centrist Democratic support to make government function - or at least to avoid self-made disaster.These debt ceiling hostage debates only seem to happen in recent decades when a Democrat is president. Remember, the debtincreased by $7 trillionunder President Donald Trump - and the debt ceiling wasraised three timesduring his tenure without a major fight.And when Democrats controlled the House and Senate in the first two years of the Biden administration, there weremore than 300 bipartisan billspassed - including big ticket items like the$1 trillion infrastructure billandthe CHIPS and Science Act.Contrary to conventional wisdom, the American economy is in strong shape withrecord low unemployment, a rise in real wages,10 months of inflation reductionand,as our CNN colleague Fareed Zakaria notes, \"The budget deficit, which was at 15.6 percent of GDP at the end of the Trump presidency, has dropped to 5.5 percent of GDP at the end of last year.\" Add to that a further $1.5 trillion debt reduction and this deal should be seen as a win-win - despite the torturous route it took to get here.McCarthy's struggle to keep the most extreme members of his party in line is nothing new, though. He is the third consecutive Republican speaker to face the frustration of trying to corral the far-right into a responsible governing coalition. Boehnerhas slammedthe \"knuckle-draggers\" in the GOP caucus - and worse. Ryanrailed againstwhat he called \"the conservative media industrial complex\" that is more interested in grandstanding than governing. Both men walked away from the speakership.But the biggest lesson to learn is that whether folks on the far right and far left oppose a deal isn't as important as whether a broad centrist coalition can come together to secure its passage because - in a time of crisis - they are willing to put country above party. It's evidence that American government can work when the center holds.This piece has been updated to reflect the latest news.TM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
