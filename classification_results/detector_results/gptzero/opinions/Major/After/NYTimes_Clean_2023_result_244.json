Also: Partisanship in judges; schools run by the Defense Department; victims of the Triangle fire.To the Editor:Re “What Kind of Person Spends $1,000 on an SS Bowl?,” by Menachem Kaiser (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 1):Objects by themselves have no meaning. Context — the story the thing tells — transforms an object into an “artifact.” Trading in Nazi memorabilia is trading in Nazi history and ideology, an ideology of hate and violence whose foundational tenet was (and is) antisemitism. That ideology became state policy and led to genocide.Pretending that these objects are just “collectibles” like Beanie Babies or “Star Wars” lightsabers dehumanizes the victims and glorifies the perpetrators.
