Politicians could have handled this at the time but chose not to. Hailing this as a big win now feels very much like straw-clutching from a near-empty bag of ideas! And remember many of us warned, including John Major, that leaving the EU would cause an exodus from the NHS.Robert BostonKentSociety still has a limited understanding of disabilityRecently the topic of dancers in wheelchairs has been hard to miss with the announcement fromStrictly Come Dancingthat a contestant this year will be a wheelchair user, as well as Kate Stanforth recently dancing on Channel 4’sThe Last Leg.  While we are very excited to see this, theinternet trolls commenting on these topicsprove there is a still long way to go.As a society, there is still such alimited understanding of disability.  Most conditions don’t follow a path where you can either comfortably walk all the time without pain or exhaustion or where you need to permanently use a wheelchair all the time. Deterioration of mobility often happens gradually.This is an issue we see so frequently at Whizz-Kidz – the UK’s leading charity for young wheelchair users. Young people and their families come to us for wheelchairs becauserestrictive NHS criteriamean that local wheelchair services are unable to prescribe a wheelchair to a young person who can walk, even if they can only walk a few metres before they are completely exhausted. Indeed, young people with cerebral palsy make up 40 per cent of those support through access to our specialist wheelchairs.What concerns me right now is the increase in young people applying to Whizz-Kidz becausebudget cuts are forcingeven more NHS wheelchair services to refuse a child a wheelchair on the basis that they can walk across a small room.Cerebral palsy can sap a young person’s energy quickly and exhaust them. They should have the choice to conserve their energy to walk when it is most important to them – such as being in the playground or participating in a dance class, instead of sapping their energy reserves walking between classrooms or to lunch break. Managing energy in this way will often help a young person to continue toparticipate in school and in societyin the way they wish until a much later age.Having a chair where you can be independently mobile iscrucial for every young person’s development, and at Whizz-Kidz we believe it is a fundamental right for children and young people. We will continue to fight for a world in which every young wheelchair is mobile, enabled, and included.Sarah PughChief executive at Whizz-KidzIn the middle of a live televised debate, it is unsurprising if Fiona Bruce made a mistakeTheBBC’s impartiality guidelinesconstitute a worthy document which seems to seek to establish balance, inclusion, fairness, and a measure of respect for facts and evidence. In any complex, democratic society media impartiality is a big challenge open, as it is, to vested interests and social division.The document explains the need to create space for alternative views and to give weight to levels of controversy, a wide range of audiences, and the need for objective evidence. We can all remember when, slightly confusingly, BBC presenters began routinely supplementing remarks of guests and contributors with fatuous reminders of the type that “other views are available”. It seemed odd when it became more common and it is odd.In general, potentially controversial remarks like that made byYasmin Alibhai-Brown on Question Timewould be better defended by the person who made them. Either at the time or later. In the heat and pace of a more or less live televised debate on complex and controversial matters, it is unsurprising if presenters make the occasional inadequate caveat. Clearly, in the Question Time incident, there was no evidence of thepresenter “trivialising” or “promoting “ domestic violence; although I have been told on Twitter that there are some issues on which men should not be allowed an opinion.David LowndesSouthampton"
