But because state officials disapprove of my religious beliefs on human sexuality, they rejected my application, excluding me from adoption because I refused toabandon my religious beliefs.PAUL BATURA: THE BEST RISK MY WIFE AND I EVER TOOKAt the same time, Oregon accommodates people of other religious and cultural backgrounds and tries to pair children with families who are well suited to each other. Devout Jews need not agree to accommodate foreign gods because some children wish to erect a family shrine to Hindu gods. And a family that hunts need not refrain from eating meat because some children are vegan.\" I cannot say or do something that goes against my faith,\" Jessica Bates writes.(Alliance Defending Freedom)The message was crystal clear: Oregon officials exclude people of faith from accessinganychild welfare service because of our beliefs about the differences between men and women. According to the Oregon agency, people who hold the stateâs view on gender identity are fit to parent, while those with religiously informed views that are different arenât even qualified to babysit newborn infants.Oregon prides itself on fostering diversity â except when it comes to making space for those who disagree with the stateâs views on sexual orientation and gender identity.State officials wonât even let me adopt kids who share my religious beliefs and would love to grow up in our household surrounded by siblings excited to welcome them into our family and worship together on Sundays. The stateâs policy makes a sweeping claim that all persons like me who hold certain beliefs â beliefs held by millions of Americans from diverse religious faiths â are categorically unfit to care for children. No one is allowed to hold a dissenting view under this state orthodoxy.Well, theyâre not done with this mother yet.Jessica Bates: \"I only ask for the opportunity to help those in need, yet the state is excluding me on every level âbecause of my faith.\"(Alliance Defending Freedom)With the legal assistance of Alliance Defending Freedom,Â Iâm suing the state of Oregon for putting politics above children. I only ask for the opportunity to help those in need, yet the state is excluding me on every level âbecause of my faith.Iâm also suing because Oregon is depriving children of loving families and forever homes. We need more families willing to take in children, not fewer. When the government discriminates against people of faith from adoption and foster care, itâs children in need who suffer.Kids deserve better than that. And thatâs why Iâm taking this stand.Oregon officialsdonât get to pick and choose which religious or ideological views they prefer and which ones get shut out. The First Amendment protects my right to live out my faith without being penalized by the government.Myfaith is what motivated meto pursue adopting and caring for orphans in the first place; all Iâm seeking is the opportunity to love and care for them.Jessica Bates is a mother of five living in Malheur County, Oregon."
