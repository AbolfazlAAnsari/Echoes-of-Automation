Market research conducted separately on behalf of the Ontario Securities Commission(https://financialpost.com/tag/ontario-securities-commission/) and Broadridge Canada (a global technology solutions firm) and similar work undertaken by U.S. and U.K. regulators makes that clear. More fundamentally, the research suggests existing retail disclosure requirements do not support good consumer outcomes.A modern disclosure regime should address content, presentation and effective delivery of information to retail investors. It should also support key policy objectives - consumer protection, market integrity, competition and growth, among others - by allowing investment fund managers and distributors to differentiate their product offerings and reduce their costs by greater use of electronic delivery. The CSA's current proposal doesn't do that.The research clearly shows that investors prefer automatic, electronic delivery of notifications and disclosure documents alike in which key information is highlighted. Direct digital delivery offers bigger cost savings and more thorough-going modernization than the fiction of \"access equals delivery\" proposed by the CSA.Looking beyond delivery requirements, regulators around the world are focussing on ensuring investors receive the information they need in a timely manner and in a format they can readily understand and use. Market research suggests investors retain information if it is presented in direct, straightforward and accessible ways. QR codes and hyperlinks embedded in existing disclosures give them quicker and easier access to the information they want. Digitization of disclosure documents enables information to be layered, which allows for the presentation of key information upfront, with more granular information later. A thoughtful transition to digitization and electronic delivery facilitates innovation(https://financialpost.com/tag/innovation/), enhances the investor experience and leads to broader cost savings.The Canadian \"Fund Facts(https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-tools/understanding-your-investments/fund-fact/)\" model is currently a leading example of a user-friendly disclosure. This two-page, point-of-sale document could easily be adapted and digitized to address the issues typically of greatest continuing concern to investors. In effect, it could become a \"portal\" through which investors could easily access whatever additional information they require. Taking steps to facilitate and encourage electronic delivery would also enable more effective two-way communications - such as pass-through proxy voting - at minimal incremental cost.William Watson: Don't copy the Americans on industrial policy(https://financialpost.com/opinion/dont-copy-americans-industrial-policy)Joe Oliver: What progressives are really trying to do and why(https://financialpost.com/opinion/what-progressives-are-really-trying-to-do-and-why)Robert Lyman: The 'truth about oil' is that the world keeps using more of it(https://financialpost.com/opinion/truth-about-oil-world-keeps-using-more)Governments and regulators in other capital markets are pursuing such opportunities. For example, the New York Stock Exchange and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ran a successful five-year pilot project in which brokers received a nominal financial incentive for encouraging e-delivery adoption. Broadridge is currently piloting a \"digital first\" experiment with several U.S. fund managers, while in the U.K. both the Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority have launched broader consultations on the future of retail disclosure.The CSA could encourage the development of a universal electronic delivery consent agreement for use by brokers, fund managers, banks and corporate issuers. Getting beyond the currently highly fragmented consent framework would dramatically reduce regulatory burdens and accelerate the transition to digital delivery.By contrast, the CSA's headlong rush to adopt the proposed \"access equals delivery\" model runs counter to the clearly stated preferences of investors. The research confirms what everyone knows: most investors do not engage with current disclosures - whether paper-based or posted on websites. The CSA's proposal will only exacerbate this problem. By focusing on saving on the cost of moving paper around, the CSA proposal will stifle more cost-effective alternatives and proven technology solutions that could realize substantial improvements to investor communications (as well as more significant cost savings).Alice and the Queen of Hearts had to run hard just to stay in place. The CSA's running in place means falling further and further behind. Canadian securities regulators should take the time to think more thoroughly about a more effective retail disclosure framework that leads, rather than lags, those being developed in other major capital markets.Jean-Paul Bureaud is executive director of FAIR Canada, an independent national non-profit organization dedicated to advocating for investor rights.
