At first, most law enforcement turned a blind eye to \"illegal immigration,\" but whenthe US government officially criminalized it in 1929- and made it a deportable offense - immigration status became a weapon to crack down on Mexican communities, first along the border, and later, throughout the country.As time marched on, the policies around the US borderexpanded to the Caribbeanto try to deter Haitians fleeing Jean-Claude Duvalier's dictatorship on makeshift boats. The US government piloted the tactic of detaining asylum-seekers in immigration detention centersin Florida, and later, atGuantanamo Bay.Frequently, Haitians were sent back - astark contrast to Cuban refugeesfleeing Fidel Castro's dictatorship, who were granted asylum, financial assistance and a path to permanent residency.Refugees were in the cross hairs of the Cold War; while Cubans benefited from the US government's commitment to fight communism and Soviet expansion, Haitians lost.Now, the estimatedtens of thousands of peoplewho are currently camping along the border are living the consequences of this history of experiments in immigration enforcement. As we wait to see what happens next, one thing is certain - their passports will play a critical role in determining their futures in, and out, of the United States.And while national security is undeniably important, it has reached a point where it is being used as an excuse to make blanket assumptions about people based on the passports that they hold, separating families and not allowing immigrants - including refugees in need of protection - to reach their full potential. Though our political conversation around immigration often focuses on how to stop the root causes of migration or the economic strain of newcomers, it rarely questions what could be done to ensure that these newcomers could settle and contribute, as quickly and painlessly as possible.In fact, state governments are taking steps that could severely complicate the political asylum process as we know it and make life even more difficult for immigrants who are already in the United States. For example, in Florida, which is home to the largest communities of Haitians, Venezuelans and Cubans in the country,a law is currently being consideredthat would make it a felony to shelter, hire or transport undocumented immigrants.In Texas, another state where Mexican and Honduran communities are a significant part of the population, Gov. Greg Abbottis trying to movemuch of immigration enforcement to a state, rather than a federal force. Advocates point out that such a shift is legally questionable and would allow the state to employ untrained civilians. Those civilians, they warn, may feel empowered to racially profile anyone who looks like a migrant, instilling fear in border communities.As we move into a new era of immigration enforcement, it is time to question what is really causing the \"crisis\" at the border - and how we imagine a world beyond it. Is it the people who have fled war, economic crises and, increasingly, the disastrous impact of climate change? Or is the true crisis a world that won't grant them freedom of movement in the first place?Opinion by Anna Lekas MillerTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
