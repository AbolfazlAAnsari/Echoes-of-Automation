Now, with Congress moving to force TikTok out of China's control, he has suddenly switched camps.Alarm bells started going off as soon as Trump's bond predicament became public. Illinois Democratic Rep. Sean Casten posted on X, \"The presumptive @GOP nominee for President is desperate for $464M (and counting),\" saying that makes him a \"massive national security risk; any foreign adversary seeking to buy a President knows the price.\"As a reminder, a New York judge last month found Trump liable for fraudulently manipulating the value of his properties, ruling that his \"complete lack of contritionand remorse borders on the pathological,\" and slapped him with a $450 million penalty, plus interest. Separately, Trump was ordered to pay more than $80 million to E. Jean Carrol in January after a jury concluded he defamed her when he denied hehad sexually assaulted her.(Trump denies all wrongdoing).In addition to nearly half a billion dollars in judgements, Trump faces massive legal fees over multiple civil and criminal cases, and his presidential campaign funds, drained afterfunding his personal legal costs, are badly lagging behind President Joe Biden'smassive war chest.Anyone who thinks America's foes are not paying attention to what could become an entry gate for a Trojan Horse is suffering from wishful thinking.Incredibly, the former president wants to bring back to his campaign none other than thedisgraced, Russian-linked, formerly imprisonedoperative Paul Manafort, his 2016 campaign chairman. Even without Trump's financial troubles this would raise all manner of red flags, especially concerning Russia.Manafort had a track record ofworking for dictatorsaround the world before he met Trump. After his stint with the 2016 Trump campaign, he was sentenced for financial crimes and served time in prison beforeTrump pardoned him.He had already receivedtens of millionsfrom Russian oligarchs and pro-Kremlin Ukrainians when he approached the Trump campaign and, oddly, offered towork for free. Representing Trump at the 2016 Republican convention, he reportedly had the GOP platformscrap aplan supporting Ukraine, then already besieged by Russia. It was a startling reversal for the party.Now Trump wants him back in, of all things, a fundraising capacity.But there are many ways to help Trump without going through the campaign or through the president. Consider son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose professional activities since leaving his senior adviser role in the Trump administration have raised eyebrows. In addition to securing a$2 billion cash infusionfrom the Saudis for his investment firm, Kushner is now busy with developments inthe Balkans.Last week, he confirmed he's closing in onmajor real estate businessesin Albania and Serbia. Regardless of the legality and (in)appropriateness of the deals, the fact that Trump's son-in-law, a former White House official, is makinghundreds of millions of dollars' worthof business deals abroad, including in places like Serbia, which hasclose connections to Russia, potentially creates more openings for cash infusions and interference by people seeking to pay for influence in US politics with an eye toward obtaining their favored government policy as a payoff.If, indeed, foreign money comes to Trump's rescue, it wouldn't be the first time.When Trump ran through his inheritance, sending several of his businesses into bankruptcy in the 1990s, banks wouldn't touch him, butRussian billionaires came to the rescue.By 2008, Donald Trump Jr., the former president's son, told a real estate conference in New York that \"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,\" adding, \"we see a lot ofmoney pouring in from Russia.\"Now, there's a lot of wealth sloshing around the globe and much of it, perhaps all of it, would like to buy influence. Foreign or domestic funders might ask for favors in exchange for their support.We have no evidence that any Russian has approached Trump or Kushner or Manafort so far. And, to be fair, Trump already aligns with the wishes of Russian President Vladimir Putin, particularly concerning Ukraine, a war Trump sounds as ifhe wants Putin to win.Already Saudi Arabia has boosted Jared and his wife Ivanka Trump's fortunes. We don't know what, if anything, the Saudis wanted in return.Trump's \"insurmountable\" money problems could easily become America's problems, because there's a fairly good chance he could become president again and, at this very moment, he is looking for a way to surmount these problems at a cost that only he may fully know.Opinion by Frida GhitisTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
