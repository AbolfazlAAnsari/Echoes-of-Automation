It was, after all, his approach to Brexit which created the need for it in the first place and highlights how little he understood of the issues at stake.But what concerns me more is the attention given to the DUP. Let us not forget one important point: the DUPdoes not represent the majorityof Northern Ireland, which voted in 2016 to remain in the EU. It bet on the wrong horse in 2019 by refusing to support Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal, which would have been far less damaging for all of the UK and would not have created today’s situation. It is now holding democracy hostage inStormontbyrefusing to join in the Executive– ironically in the only part of the UK which enjoys proportional representation for a real democratic mandate.The protocol represents much of why leaving the EU – especially on the terms devised by Johnson and his allies – is so damaging on so many levels to this country. Sunak must be allowed to try and put right the mess he has inherited. If he makes his own mistakes he will be judged accordingly, but it is not right forpeople whose only contribution to the topicso far is failure to try to undermine someone else trying to put it right.Charles WoodBirminghamLosing faithThe current SNP leadership contest has led to widespread media coverage of the religious faith of the two main candidates. There seems to be a general consensusthat faith and politics are incompatible, or at least shouldn’t mix.This is hugely inconsistent for many reasons.Firstly, we are told that identity and being true to oneself is everything, and yet seek to deny that to people of faith, for whom belief is their core identity. Secondly, society seems to want to cherry-pick the bits of religious faith it likes, while denying its adherents the parts that are unacceptable to the secular mindset. It’s OK for Christiansto run food banks, but not to talk abouthuman sexuality.Thirdly, secularists call out the religious for being intolerant, while displaying their own intolerance.Andy BrownDerbyWhat exactly is the incentive?One aspect of the Conservative energy policy was to providetax exemption from profits on oil and gas,if these profits were then invested intorenewable energysources.How could so little taxation on so much profit incentivise energy companies not to continue in oil and gas? How much of the vast profit did energy companies feel compelled, through fear of such small taxation,to redirect into renewables?Margie Elagr-BondInvernessThere’s only one way to achieve social and environmental justiceI’m genuinely impressed by the judge’s candor and integrity in the recentverdict against the Just Stop Oil protesters.The attitude of the general public should follow suit. We need to stop comforting profitable fossil-fuel-producing corporations with taxpayer-funded subsidies. Lobbying firms with close ties tofossil fuelcompanies should be banned from promoting the industry’s interests in widespread media, we should expose the largest financiers of the nation’s fossil fuel extraction.It is the only way to achieve the social and environmental justice we need today. It shouldn’t be a partisan position for any media giant to take, especially considering fossil fuel’s role in man-createdglobal warmingand thus climate change.Frank Sterle JrAddress SuppliedSunak knows what needs to be doneBoth employers and employees are being very selective in their choice of statistics during thiswinter of discontentto exaggerate their respective claims. But no matter how you cut the numbers, it is unavoidable to conclude that during the last 10 years, pay settlements in thepublic sector have lagged behindinflation. Such action was pure stupidity during a time of low inflation when moderately improved progressive settlements could have avoided the understandable currentstrikes crisis.You reap what you sow, and the Tories’ short-sighted parsimony is totally to blame for the current famine. Now is not the best time to make good their mistakes, but itneeds to be done and Rishi Sunak knows it.So get on with it, PM! Dither and delay only pull your party and the country down further.Tim SidawayHertfordshire"
