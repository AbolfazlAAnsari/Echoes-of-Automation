USDA data shows that for all individuals average daily carbohydrate intake is up 22% since the late 1970s, fat is up 12% and protein is unchanged. For low-income individuals, carbohydrates are up 26%, fat is up 11% and protein is down 3%.The reasons for these higher obesity rates are not fully understood. Since the 1970s, average daily calories have risen about the same percent for low-income and other Americans, although the types of calories vary. When food stamps were created in the 1960s, low earners suffered from insufficient food, but today they consume too much unhealthy food.A USDA website says that \"poor nutrition is a leading cause of illness in the United States, associated with more than half a million deaths per year,\" but the agency’s largest program, SNAP, delivers poor nutrition. The SNAP program itself warns people not to consume sugary drinks, yet sugary drinks are the most popular food item purchased by recipients.SNAP’s approach of subsidizing total caloric intake makes no sense in a population struggling with obesity. One reform would be to end subsidies for cola and other junk foods, as Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio has proposed.An alternate reform would be to replace the subsidize-all-foods method of SNAP with a fruits-and-vegetables-only program, which would save taxpayers about $100 billion a year.However, the best reform would be to phase out federal SNAP altogether and allow states to fund their own food programs. Low-income nutrition is a complex problem and would be better tackled by diverse state approaches.Numerous states have sought USDA waivers to ban junk foods from SNAP, but the USDA has rejected all such requests even though the current \"anything goes\" program has failed on nutrition.The USDA’s SNAP website says that the program allows people to \"afford the nutritious food essential to health and well-being,\" but nutritious food is not what SNAP provides. It is time to end the failed national program and allow the states to find better solutions for both recipients and taxpayers.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CHRIS EDWARDSChris Edwards is the Kilts Family Chair in Fiscal Studies at the Cato Institute.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
