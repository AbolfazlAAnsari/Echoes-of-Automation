On the other hand, substituting another drug might also lead to an inferior outcome, and could also lead to more side effects. Simply delaying therapy would almost certainly result in harm.I have been an oncologist specializing in breast cancer for over 30 years. I know firsthand, from having cared for thousands of patients, that a diagnosis ofbreast canceris frightening, challenging and truly one of the most difficult experiences most people have faced.Women, and occasionally men, are forced to deal with affronts to theirbody image,treatmentsthat impair quality of life, worries aboutcancer recurrenceand the fear that their lives will be cut short. As oncologists, we try to form partnerships with patients, and we do our best to understand every patient's unique circumstances.Today,an increasing numberof individuals with breast cancer in the US are cured, as aremany patientswithother types of cancer. Survival rates haveimprovedsubstantially because of earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment. But if patients are to benefit from improved treatment, they need to haveaccessto that therapy. The drug shortages pose a threat to the improvements that we have made in cancer outcomes.When oncologists tell their patients that the standard, and usually best, therapy is unavailable, the conversation quickly becomes both challenging and heart-wrenching. The reactions can vary quite dramatically. Some patients are angry, and that anger can be directed toward the doctor, the health care system or even the government for failing to protect them.Others are simply terrified, overwhelmed by the fear that their lives will be shortened as a consequence of the shortages. Finally, some may just become withdrawn and depressed, believing that this new challenge is another part of nightmare they have been living through since their day of diagnosis. No matter what the reaction, the discussion can strain the doctor-patient relationship andadds to the burdenof coping with a cancer diagnosis.This crisis affects all patients with cancer, but its impact is particularly hard onchildren with cancer. Between 2010 and 2020,8 of the 10most frequently used drugs to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia - themost common childhood cancer- were, at some point, temporarily unavailable. We do not know the full extent to which this has impaired our ability to cure children with cancer.Current drugs in shortage include the chemotherapy agentcarboplatin, considered an important option for treating breast, ovarian, lung, head and neck and other cancers. Another scarce medicine,fludarabine,treats several types of leukemia and lymphoma. It has been on the FDA'sdrug shortage listsince 2020, and many American cancer centers have completely run out.Regulators and legislators must act urgently to alleviate these shortages and develop long-term solutions. Part of the challenge is that they stem frommultiple causes,includinglack of availability of raw ingredients, quality issues in plants which are largely located outside of the US, regulatory barriers and global emergencies that lead to supply-chain disruptions.To prevent these shortages, US regulators should expand on the existing essential medicines list to create a more comprehensive list of critical drugs - both for cancer and other conditions - needed for emergency responses and saving lives. Every drug on the list should be evaluated for availability, quality, manufacturer reliability and potential weaknesses in the supply chain.The list of drugs should be used as a starting point to coordinate access to drugs in anticipation of natural disasters, public health crises and other unforeseen events. In the same vein, the government should consider establishing and maintaining a buffer supply of critical drugs, which would help avert shortages. Manufacturers, the FDA, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response and other government agencies would all have to work together.Drug shortages are acute today in the US, but the drug manufacturing and supply chain is global. Assuring consistent access to life-saving drugs will require theinternational community to work togetherto achieve a regulatory and manufacturing environment that incentivizes production of high-quality drugs and allows quick response when production is jeopardized by global events.To be sure, these aren't quick fixes, but drug shortages did not come about overnight. The lack of critical medicines available to cancer patients is a disgrace and is emblematic of a system gone awry.We need the government and manufacturers to do everything they can.  And we can never forget about the patient who is in desperate need of therapy that can save their life.  If we put the patient first, we have no choice but to act in all due haste.Opinion by Eric P.
