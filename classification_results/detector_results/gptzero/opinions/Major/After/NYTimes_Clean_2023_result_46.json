As the saying goes, “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”However, professional competence applies to the classroom, and a decision about Professor Wax should be based on whether she is discussing legal theories and dealing with students based only on their academic abilities, as shown by performance on class assignments and in class participation, without regard to their race or ethnic background.Gary LefkowitzNew Fairfield, Conn.To the Editor:Let’s avoid muddy thinking so as not to confuse two separate issues: Academic freedom and tenure pertain to the free expression of ideas sustained by rigorous scholarship.

Such behavior would surely constitute a hostile work environment, rather than merely an exercise in academic freedom.So why is it that the students whom Professor Wax was hired to educate are less deserving of the same respect? Students deserve a safe working environment, too — one in which professors help them engage in positive, productive discourse that challenges them to do more complex thinking about the world and their place in it.Viewing the role of the professor in that light, I cannot understand how Professor Wax’s comments further academic freedom instead of stifling it.Conservatives used to talk about lower taxes, smaller government and equality of opportunity. Anyone can still talk about these things on a campus.
