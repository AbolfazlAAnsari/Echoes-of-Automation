But itâ€™s our collective responsibility to change this narrative, making it clear that their mental health is a priority, and that it is an act of strength and courage, not weakness, to reach out for help.The Mighty Oaks Foundation plays a pivotal role in combating this stigma by providing a safe and supportive environment for veterans to open up about their experiences. Through our programs, veterans are encouraged to share their stories and connect with others who have faced similar challenges. By doing so, they begin to realize that they are not alone in their struggles and that there is hope for healing and recovery.These brave men and women have been unwavering in their dedication to a mission of service to and in defense of our nation and freedoms. But instead of feeling our support as they grapple with the aftereffects of that service, they often face vilification in society and the media. They are overlooked by their own leaders, who often sweep their struggles under the rug.After graduating from our programs with a renewed sense of hope and purpose, these brave men and women often turn around to reach out their hand to others who are struggling, helping them find new hope and purpose. Imagine how the outstretched hands of society could help those who have sacrificed so much to afford us the freedom and prosperity we so richly enjoy in this incredible nation.A single day of recognition isnâ€™t enough to fully appreciate the immense personal sacrifices made by men and women who love and serve you without even knowing you. As we commemorate Veterans Day, let us also remember that the process of healing is ongoing. It requires continuous effort, understanding and support from our communities. And in this time of unprecedented societal division, we should take every opportunity for community healing.Veterans Day should be about more than just barbecues and sales. It should be a reminder of the freedoms we enjoy in America and an opportunity to rededicate ourselves to supporting and honoring the veterans who sacrificed to safeguard those freedoms. As we come together as a nation in remembrance, appreciation and support, we can honor the heroes who have sacrificed so much for our freedom.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CHAD ROBICHAUXChadÂ RobichauxÂ is a former Force Recon Marine and an Afghanistan veteran.
