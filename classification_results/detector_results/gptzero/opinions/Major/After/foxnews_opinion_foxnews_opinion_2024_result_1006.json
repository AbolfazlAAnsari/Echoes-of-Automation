There have long been measles outbreaks in our southern states traced to migrant workers.The same holds true for flu, COVID-19, chicken pox, resistant tuberculosis as well as the STDs Hodges highlighted. Not to mention dehydration, malnutrition, injuries and drownings affecting people trying to cross. And then there are synthetic opioids, including fentanyl and nitazenes, which are brought freely across our porous southern border and accelerate the drug epidemic thoughout the U.S.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONMost Americans have a story of a relative or ancestor who crossed here legally being delayed for health reasons either recently or in centuries past, when health screenings were a crucial part of the rites of passage.The need for a public health barrier still exists, and in fact, Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC director at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, told me that invoking Title 42 in 2020 was not meant for COVID-19 alone, but for other contagious diseases as well.Redfield said that he was trying to protect Customs and Border Protection agents who were being overwhelmed and exposed to not just COVID-19 but the flu and other contagious diseases as well as the illegal migrants who were being held in overcrowded facilities. The problem is that it is essentially impossible to screen people who are entering the country illegally or, as Redfield told me, \"to process them in a manner consistent with sound public health procedures.\"Title 42 was created decades ago to enable emergency action, including, when applicable, to \"stop the introduction of communicable diseases.\" The COVID-19 pandemic has ended, but the problem has not gone away. Bringing back Title 42 could be a small step towards recognizing that our unsecured southern border includes a significant public health risk.Don’t get me wrong, communicable diseases are not unique among migrants, but we have no systemic ability to either screen them for diseases or vaccinate them against them. At a minimum, we must do our best to ensure that anyone entering this country is not putting the rest of our citizenry at risk.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MARC SIEGELMarc Siegel, M.D. is a professor of medicine and medical director of Doctor Radio at NYU Langone Medical Center.
