            "inputText": "By Ian IrvineConsistency is rare in government policy, especially in the regulation of \"sin\" goods - cannabis, alcohol, tobacco/nicotine and gambling. Ottawa frets over flavoured nicotine and e-cigarette liquid containing more than two parts in a hundred of the stuff yet is comfortable with the sale of extra-strength cannabis in uncountable flavors in combustible (i.e., carcinogenic) format. Though he apparently doesn't use nicotine, Prime Minister Trudeau did fess up several years ago about cannabis and that apparently was enough to persuade the public service to get on side with legalization.Canada is not alone in struggling for consistency in this area. The U.K. is very enlightened in most of its tobacco and nicotine rules, but Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's recent proposal to ban the sale of cigarettes to anyone born after January 2009 is naïve. To start with, the ban will affect Brits aged 14 and under. But as time marches on, the 2009 restriction doesn't change. In 2050, people born in 2009 will turn 41 but they and everyone younger still won't be able to buy smokes. Only 42-year-olds and up will be. This sliding-age limit government over-reach comes from a self-professed Thatcherite.In general, the U.K.'s quit-smoking policies are positive and sensible quit-smoking policies, unlike most of the rest of the world, Canada included, which mainly goes negative. The Royal College of Physicians advocates for minimal taxes on reduced-harm products like vaping. Some U.K. hospitals even have vape shops in their lobbies. The Swap-to-Stop campaign actually distributes vaping kits, up to one million of them, to get people off smoking. U.K.-based ASH - Action on Smoking on Health - is a citadel of good sense on these issues.Laws that can't be enforced won't work. How will the authorities enforce an age-specific ban with an age that rises every year? Everyone older than the limit will have to show their age card when they smoke in public or make a purchase? Will people get tickets if they cannot produce evidence of age? Or be taken to the local police station for interrogation about where they purchased their smokes? Will society want its police force to harass 20-somethings but not 30-somethings this decade, but 30-somethings but not 40-somethings next? How will the police react to tourist use? Will young tourists puffing away in London incur bobbies' wrath?Police resources are dreadfully short and also very valuable: research indicates more policing generally means more safety. Will it really make sense for police to crack down on tobacco \"crime\" when fentanyl is killing thousands of people a year?Such nanny-state policy stands in opposition to the de minimis principle of wise legislation. Today in North America the daily smoking rate among high-school kids is just one per cent - barely visible. A 2022 Yougov survey in the U.K. disclosed a similar rate. Should significant resources be devoted to addressing a problem this small? Mr. Sunak's generation (high-school kids in the 1990s) had a daily smoking rate 20 times this one per cent. Today's kids evidently are much smarter.In countries we normally compare ourselves to, 18 is a common minimum age for voting, for being conscripted for war, for being charged in adult rather than juvenile court and for being allowed to buy alcohol, cannabis or weapons. If 18 or so is a reasonable threshold for all these things, why have the threshold for tobacco rise and rise until no one of any age can buy it?Age may very well be an effective signal of risk for youth contemplating various \"sins.\" Authorities might set slightly different ages for substances bearing different risks. For example, if the age for reduced-harm nicotine-based products (vaping and snus, the Swedish snuff) were set at 18, the age for high-risk products (combustibles) could be 19. This small differential would signal - more effectively than conflicting claims coming from social media - that combustibles are more dangerous.Matthew Lau: To end 'shrinkflation,' shrink Ottawa bureaucracy(https://financialpost.com/opinion/matthew-lau-to-end -shrinkflation-shrink-inflation-and-ottawa-bureaucracy )Opinion: Liberals should reject NDP national pharmacare plan(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-liberals-should-reject-the-national-pharmacare-monopoly-the-ndp-wants)Opinion: We're not being taxed to death - it just feels that way(https://financialpost.com/opinion/canadians-not-being-taxed-to-death-just-feels-that-way)Law-makers need to recognize law's limitations. Implementing a rule does not mean it will be observed. The nicotine sector of the economy is well served by illegal providers who will relish the opportunity to gain a larger market share as a result of prohibition-mentality legislation.Ian Irvine, an economics professor at Concordia University, has advised the federal government on alcohol and plain-packaging policies and the private sector on tobacco policy.
