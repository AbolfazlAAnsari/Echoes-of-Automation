In recent days, the debate has shifted from wild speculation over the princess's whereabouts to a moral panic about the British royal family's apparent history of doctoring photos presented to the public as candids.The photo-doctoring controversy has provided a pretext for more legitimate media outlets,including this one, to weigh in on the great Kate debate, but it's hard to shake the feeling that it is just that - a pretext.So, Kate touches up her photos.

But the candid photo, it turned out, wasn't so candid after all.Shortly after, the key press agenciesReuters, Getty and the Associated Press pulled the photofrom their systems and issued statements to the effect that it did not meet journalistic standards of truthful representation.The princess later apologized for the confusion around the photograph and confessed that occasionally she likes to \"experiment with editing.\"Then, on Tuesday, the international photo agency Getty announced that they had determined thata 2023 photograph of the late Queen Elizabeth II surrounded by her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, taken by Kate, had been digitally enhanced at source.All of which has prompted extensive media debate about the history and legitimacy of royal image alteration,including a lengthy piece in Vogue, ironically a publication known fordoctoring its own photographs.It is fair to say that Kate has history on her side. The royals' long history of embellishment in portraiture even got a nod in the rock musical\"Six,\"in which Henry VIII's fourth wife Anne of Clevessings\"Ich bin Anna of Cleves - when he saw my portrait he was like Ja!

The public adore the royals, but that adoration rests on being told the truth.\" Leaving aside the question of whether the British public \"adore\" the royals, the British people do feel a certain entitlement over them, an entitlement that goes beyond the belief that they should not be deceived.In exchange for their state-supported privilege, most Britons feel entitled to a level of access to the royal family that is incompatible with Kate's nearly three-month mystery seclusion.More than 150 years ago, the man who would be future prime minister, Lord Salisbury, made the same point when Queen Victoria temporarily withdrew from public life following the death of her husband Prince Albert. \"Seclusion is one of the few luxuries in which royal personages may not indulge ... loyalty needs a life of almost unintermitted publicity to sustain it.\" Or, as the motto famously attributed to Queen Elizabeth II goes: \"I have to be seen to be believed.\"It's a mantra that King Charles III appears to have taken to heart. In contrast to the princess, he allowed himself to bephotographed leaving the London Clinic on January 29,after receiving treatment for an enlarged prostate, whereas Kate's departure from the same hospital that same day went unrecorded.As head of state, he needs to be seen out and about. When it was clear his health condition would affect his abilities to perform his public-facing duties, the King was quick to inform the public that cancer had been detected during the prostate procedure and that he would be receiving treatment.While it is easy to understand the princess's desire for privacy during what is doubtless a difficult time,the length of her time away feels incompatible with her position as a \"working royal.\"Kate still hasn't been seen in public for any official engagements, but she was spotted at a farm shop near her home with husband Prince William on Saturday, easing some questions around her health.Like the King and Queen Camilla, the Prince and Princess of Wales and the other seven \"working royals\" are meant to serve the country publicly for which they are paid by British taxpayers from the sovereign grant,currently upwards of around £86 million ($109 million) a year.Public appearances are arguably their raison d'etre.The royal family, like everyone else, should be entitled to a period of paid sick leave. But just as most of us cannot disappear from work for months on end without sufficient explanation, some British people feel a legitimate right to ask the Windsors to be more forthcoming about Kate's condition.Opinion by Laura BeersTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
