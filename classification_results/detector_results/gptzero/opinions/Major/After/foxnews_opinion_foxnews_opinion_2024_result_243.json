We had a great time reconnecting and reminiscing. Love and laughter filled the house.President Trump's assassination attempttook place during the reunion. It contrasted the unity we were experiencing and the division our country is experiencing.Re means \"back to\" so a reunion is back to the union. It’s needed in families, communities and our country. We should, in the words of our Constitution, be seeking a more perfect union.The DeBartolo cousins gather for a familly portrait in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. (Jeremy Passamonte)It can start in the family, the most basic unit of our culture. Our family reunion experience was a microcosm of what can happen across our land.AMERICANS AGREE ON MOST CORE VALUES, THINK OUR DEMOCRACY FUNCTIONS POORLY, POLL FINDSWe all stayed in one big house. People from Connecticut to Arizona, Florida to Ohio all under one roof. The age divide spanned 30 years. Family, yes, but still different in many ways.We areone big American family. A variety of states but one homeland. A span of ages but all still Americans. Differences, certainly, but also neighbors who care for each other.It takes work to get along, but it can be done.(iStock, courtesy of user Patrick Chu)I’ve learned this in many years of marriage, sometimes you must agree to disagree. We simply can’t always agree on everything. And sometimes we vehemently disagree. You don’t dissolve the marriage over it; you work on getting along despite it.At our reunion, some went to Dollywood, some to the national park and some stayed in the house the entire time. Different ways to enjoy our family connections. We didn’t have to all agree on one approach.FOUNDERS' JULY 4TH LESSON: DIVIDED BY POLITICS BUT UNITED IN CORE VALUES OF A FREE PEOPLEOf course, we did need to agree on meals, responsibilities, schedule. Different doesn’t mean chaos. It takes work to get along; it’s not natural. Selfishness is inborn, service takes effort. But it can be done. Americans have proved it foralmost 250 years.Clingmans Dome in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where the family gathered for their reunion.(Rick McDaniel)We didn’t have any blowout fights. But with a group of Italian Americans together for three days it certainly could have happened. But even if there was conflict, we would have resolved it because we love each other.Americans can disagree without being disagreeable. We can have fights without violence. We can have our views without hating those who have different views.On Sunday morning, we had a worship service in the theater room of the house. Music was played and my cousin’s husband spoke on God’s grace to our family. We worshiped together because we all share the Christian faith.AMERICAN VALUES: WHAT SMALL TOWN AMERICA IS SAYING ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM, 'GETTING TOO HARD'There is much that binds us together as Americans, much more than what divides us.(iStock)But not everyone in America does. So, I may disagree with certain values or viewpoints of others. This means we will advocate differently and vote differently. And that is America. I support yourright to have a different opinion– even in opposition to mine.Our family reunion reinforced what I know is true. People need to reconnect over what they love more than what they hate. There is much that binds us together as Americans, much more than what divides us.I love my cousins, but I have not spent enough time with them. Getting to know them better helped me to appreciate them more, to value their journey and story.Let’s reconnect over our shared values and reunite America.(iStock)I spent time with one of my cousins and her husband. I’ve always liked them but now I do in a deeper way. The greater knowledge leads to a stronger affinity. I would like to get to know them better.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThe back deckreplaced the front porchand changed our communities.
