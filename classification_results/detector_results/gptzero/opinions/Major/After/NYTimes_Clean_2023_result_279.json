I find myself wanting to disappear into an emotionally safe but ultimately self-destructive psychological ghetto, where the only people I truly trust are other Jews.I do not think I am alone in this.Deborah L. DruckerQueensTo the Editor:Senator Chuck Schumer’s article hit a nerve with me. Growing up in Connecticut, I never felt the sting of antisemitism. Working for Congress or practicing law in Washington for 50 years, I never felt the sting of antisemitism.Now, for the first time I feel threatened. I have been forced to recognize that there are Americans who would like me dead. It’s scary for all American Jews.Our political leaders, and all leaders, including university presidents, must speak with one voice on the subject of hatred against Jews or any Americans, including African Americans and Arab Americans. We cannot accept what is going on in the country.Marshall MatzMcLean, Va.Biden’s Meeting With Muslim AmericansTo the Editor:Re “At White House Visit, Muslim Americans Air Frustrations to Biden” (news article, Nov. 29):Unfortunately, in its zeal to see the political side of every story, and to portray all events as presenting problems or obstacles to the president, The Times missed the most important point about President Biden’s meeting with Muslim Americans: The best friend that Palestinians and the idea of a Palestinian state have on the world stage is Joe Biden. Who else would have met with the leaders for more than an hour, and resisted his aides’ attempt to pull him out of the conference?Mr. Biden has spoken out tirelessly for humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza and pushed relentlessly for the tenuous agreement that has stilled the guns for almost a week, resulting in the release of some hostages and a substantial number of Palestinian prisoners.There is a great deal of noise and posturing — much of it self-righteous — over the unimaginably complex puzzle of the Middle East right now, but Mr. Biden has steered a constant and effective course for the best result obtainable. That should have been the story.Jonathan J. MargolisBrookline, Mass.Jimmy Carter’s FortitudeTo the Editor:Re “From Humble Roots to Presidential Confidante, a First Lady Is Extolled” (news article, Nov. 29):The photographs from Rosalynn Carter’s memorial service are the latest addition to the album of our nation’s history, but I think none are more powerful than those of former President Jimmy Carter.I initially felt a sadness recalling his younger energy as he ran to shake as many of our hands as possible upon his arrival for the 1976 Democratic Convention in New York City. Several months later I would turn 18, and he would be my first presidential vote.But then I felt a sense of joy realizing the astounding fortitude this 99-year-old man still possesses.Mr. Carter has surpassed nine months of home hospice care and traveled about 140 miles to be such an important presence at the service honoring his wife. How nice he is still around for his family and others who love him.Jeffrey B. FreedmanNew YorkA Writer’s JourneyTo the Editor:Re “Rebuilding Myself After Brain Injury, Sentence by Sentence,” by Kelly Barnhill (Opinion guest essay, Nov. 26):Many thanks to Ms. Barnhill for her profoundly moving piece about rebuilding her life after a traumatic brain injury. With eloquence and emotion, she takes the reader through her deeply personal and ongoing journey toward recovery, whatever that may mean.She offers not only the detailed, clinical descriptions of her losses but also the devastating ramifications for one whose work is built on memory, creativity and imagination. She doubts at times that she’ll ever be able to string words into sentences and stories, and her path is one of painful, small steps.But as this essay so beautifully shows, she is an astonishing storyteller. In our own lives, defined by achievement and multitasking, her life lesson is one we should all take to heart.Cindy OstroffSan Rafael, Calif.Cruise Ships in Key WestTo the Editor:Re “Cruise Ships Emerge as a Critical Issue for DeSantis’s Campaign” (news article, Nov. 27):I love the simplicity and quiet of Key West. It draws visitors like me once a year to escape not only the cold winters of New York, but also the crowds of New York.Please make Key West free of cruise ships. It is an ideal tourist town because it remains a livable city for its laid-back residents.Steve RolstonBaldwin, N.Y.This article appeared in print on page A27."
