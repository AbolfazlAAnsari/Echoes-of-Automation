(Photo by Brendan SMIALOWSKI / AFP)Meanwhile, the Big Three are myopically focused on Trump‚Äôs fourth indictment ‚Äì the timing of which not so coincidentally follows the latest shocking revelation in the Biden influence-peddling scandal.The Big Three‚Äôs abject refusal to report on the Biden bribery scandal while providing wall-to-wall coverage of the dubious charges against Trump is not just a betrayal of their viewers; it constitutes election tampering. As such, their behavior is a threat to democracy.Last week, an even bigger bombshell. It turns out then-Vice President Joe Biden was using a web of pseudonyms, from Robert Peters to Robin Ware to JRB Ware, while working with his son to place tens of millions of dollars in that web of LLCs. The National Archives revealed that its holdings contain nearly5,400 emails, electronic records and documentsindicating that Biden used aliases while he was vice president.Those who don‚Äôt watch or read these leftist propagandists ‚Äì and there are plenty of reasons not to tune in ‚Äì might wonder if it matters. The answer is clear. At the height of the Hunter Biden laptop scandal, ahead of the 2020 elections, the legacy media refused to cover it or dismissed it as Russian disinformation.The pattern continues. Not one story in the pro-Biden press.It is time for Biden to face an impeachment inquiry to find out whether he used the power of the vice presidency to rake in millions of dollars for his family, Additionally, President of ABC News Kimberly Godwin, CEO and President of CBS News Wendy McMahon, and NBC News President Rebecca Blumenstein should be invited to appear before a congressional committee and be prepared to answer for this behavior.The American people deserve to hear the truth. Suppressing the news is not something we should expect outside of totalitarian regimes.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM L.
