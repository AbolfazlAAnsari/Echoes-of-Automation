Jordan will now be investigating the very President he tried to prevent from taking power.But Jordan is not the only lawmaker who would seem to have no place as a House committee chairman. There's also Green, who now heads the House Committee on Homeland Security. The concerns about Green go beyond his voting to prevent the certification of the 2020 election to includea history of anti-Muslim and anti-LGBTQ comments.In 2017, Trump nominated Green as secretary of the Army. As a Tennessee state senator, Greenhad championed legislationto make iteasier to discriminate against LGBTQ Americans, and he toldan online radio showhe opposed transgender equality because in his view as a public official he was required to \"crush evil.\"During a 2016 tea party meeting,he denounced teaching childrenabout the Islamic faith in schools unless it was focused on \"the assault of Islam\" on others.Green's remarks were so controversial that thelate GOP Sen. John McCainandSen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, expressed concern. Given the backlash,Green withdrew his namefrom consideration as Army secretary. But now he has been elevated to the coveted position of a committee chair after being elected to Congress in 2018.The House GOP is telling the nation who it believes deserving of positions of power - and that is people who put service to Trump over the interests of our country. To me, that's the very definition of un-American.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
