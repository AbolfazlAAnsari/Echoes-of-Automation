TheOlympic Dam mine containsone of the world's largest known deposits of uranium, and where is it found? South Australia.The arrival ofpandas in Edinburghin 2011 was tied to contracts valued at several billion dollars for the supply of renewable energy technology, salmon and Land Rovers. The agreement to send pandas to Copenhagen is said to have coincided with 40 new trade agreements betweenChina and Denmark.And also unlike most other zoo animals, pandas cannot experience the biological inevitabilities of illness and death without causing a political disturbance. The Memphis pandas - and allegations that the zoo had been neglectful - are just the latest example. In 2010, when amale panda diedin the midst of an electroejaculation operation at Oji Zoo in Japan, there was outrage on Chinese social media based on next-to-no evidence that the Japanese had done this tohumiliate its age-old rival.This increasing politicization of pandas comes with a cost. As the political animal grows in strength, the zoological animal - the real wild panda - gets eclipsed. Wild pandas arenative to central China, and while their numbers have reportedly started to increase thanks mostly toconservation efforts, with Chinese officials announcing in 2021 that they had moved fromendangered to vulnerable speciesstatus, they are still far too few for comfort. Thelatest count puts them at 1,864, but it's hard to know if that figure and previous calculations which were comparatively lower are completely accurate.I would argue that captive pandas are not really pandas at all. Under the strong selective forces imposed by human minds, it is as if they have become another species entirely. Trapped in captivity, bottle-fed from birth, brought bamboo by an army of zookeepers and given no experience of navigating the complex topography of a mountainside,reintroduction into the wildremains nearly impossible.The inability to exchange genetic material with their real, wild counterparts is the definition of reproductive isolation, precisely the conditions that lead to genetic divergence and ultimately the origin of a new species. In fact, geneticists have alreadydocumented genetic differencesbetween captive and wild pandas.The next time a panda dispute erupts, try to resist the temptation to talk politics. Focusing on the cartoon-like captive panda threatens to erase the identity of the real, wild panda, a remarkable creature about which we still know so little. You might never see a wild panda, but they are out there, sitting on their backsides, cracking bamboo in the fragmented forests of middle China.Opinion by Henry NichollsTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
