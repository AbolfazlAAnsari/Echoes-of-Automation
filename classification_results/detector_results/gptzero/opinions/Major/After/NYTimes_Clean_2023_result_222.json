            "inputText": "I F OPINION polls are to be believed, Donald Trump has the 2024 Republican presidential nomination in the bag. But in a recent Times Opinion focus group with 13 Republican voters who are looking at candidates other than Mr. Trump, the idea that the race was all but over sounded off base, either because they don't know any other Republicans who want Mr. Trump back in office or because he seems beatable for the nomination. ''My Republican friends say they are for anybody but Trump,'' said one focus group participant, Carrie, a 55-year-old from Michigan. Referring to the pro-Trump polls, she asked, ''Where are these people?'' Andreia, a 45-year-old from Virginia, argued, ''There has to be another person out there that is more responsible than this man.'' But who is that other person? Ron DeSantis came in for a mix of criticism and grudging praise, and Vivek Ramaswamy seemed a figure of fleeting interest.The enthusiasm was strongest (but not universal) for Nikki Haley, a former governor of South Carolina. One reason is that she is talking about the top issue on these voters' minds: the economy, specifically inflation and the debt. Few of these voters cared about immigration or wokeism, by contrast. ''People are losing their jobs and can't afford health care, and you're going to legislate whether or not somebody can read a book?'' said Sara, a 53-year-old from South Carolina. Speaking ahead of this past Wednesday night's second Republican presidential debate, the focus group dug into the qualities, ideas and priorities that they would like to see in the next Republican nominee and grappled with ways that the various candidates do and don't measure up. In the end, we wanted to know, if the race came down in 2024 to Mr. Trump and President Biden, would they give in and vote for Mr. Trump? It was the most painful question for some of them -- and yielded bad news for Mr. Trump but no silver lining for Mr. Biden, either.PARTICIPANTS Alex 36, Mass., white, H.R. manager Amanda 43, Calif., white, assistant principal Andreia 45, Va., Latina, compliance analyst Carrie 55, Mich., white, subject matter specialist Chad 32, Utah, white, real estate Charla 64, Texas, white, H.R. manager Deborah 60, N.C., white, homemaker John 64, Calif., Latino, finance director Mike 42, Va., white, real estate investor Pamela 52, Texas, white, network analyst Reed 37, S.C., white, manufacturing Rodney 53, Mich., white, health care claims analyst Sara 53, S.C., white, office managerWhat's one word or phrase you would use to describe how you feel about former President Trump? Pamela: Go away. Mike: Immoral. Andreia: Betrayed. John: Disgusted. Moderator: Anybody have a different kind of word? Like, a positive or a neutral word? Carrie: Disappointed. Chad: That was going to be my word. Yeah, disappointed. Charla: Power trip and insane. Moderator: Did Jan. 6 change how you feel about former President Trump? Andreia: There are no words to describe how angry I get when I think about Jan. 6. People got hurt, they lost their lives. And a responsible person, let alone the leader of a free country -- there had to have been a better way to speak his mind without instigating violence. Deborah: I work at an election polling place. I've been doing it for years. We're real careful. North Carolina doesn't require IDs, but we check their information. We try to make sure that no one is denied the right to vote or is influenced to vote. I did not want to see Biden win, but I do not feel that Trump handled it properly. I felt like he deliberately created a division in the American people to get them to come to the Capitol. Who does that? I don't care how angry I am at someone. I'm not going to threaten them with a ball or a bat or with a gun to have my way. Carrie: When he lost the election, Georgia had a runoff election for two senators. And Republicans could have won those races. But Trump had so much negativity. At a certain point, you lost. Move on and help the people who still have a chance. Moderator: How would you feel if Trump was the Republican nominee for president again? Sara: Shocked. Reed: Democrat. [Laughs.] Amanda: Not surprised. Deborah: Horrified. Rodney: Disappointed in the country. John: I wouldn't be surprised. There's a base that will support him, no matter what, and that will carry him through the primaries. Amanda: Yeah, no offense to anybody, but I think a majority of the United States is just delusional. How can you listen to someone like that talk and be like, ''Oh, yeah, let's vote for him''? Andreia: I would be surprised. His tantrums, the narcissism. It's too much. There has to be another person out there that is more responsible than this man. Chad: To Andreia's point, with everything that's happened in the last few years, this is the best that we could do? Carrie: I just can't believe all the surveys or the polls that are coming out that said Trump is the favorite. I mean, unless people are lying to me. My Republican friends say they are for anybody but Trump. I just don't get it. Where are these people? Moderator: How fit do you think he is to be president? Deborah: Not at all. Mike: I would agree. He is not a great leader in terms of morality and setting an example for America's youth. Reed: He's a great showman. But that's all he is. Deborah: But we don't need a showman. Reed: Exactly. If Donald Trump became president again, how would that affect you? Chad: It would cause even more political divide in the country. Reed: People will either be all Trump or no Trump. Deborah: I told my grandkids, I wouldn't be surprised to see another Civil War because people get so divided over politics. Pamela: If my 401(k) went back up, I'd be happy. That's all. I don't care about his rhetoric and things like that. As long as he has results, ultimately, that's what's positive. Reed: My family and I would live in far more fear than we currently do. Fear of a national disaster, of a civil war. And also a fear that he's going to pop his mouth off about something and piss off the wrong overseas entity and get us all blown off the map, to be honest. Moderator: How does Trump make you feel about being a Republican? Charla: I was raised as a Republican. I was always a very proud Republican. And with the crap that's happened in the last few years, I have looked at the other party, just for somebody that seemed more sane. Carrie: Well, I understand the populism behind him. Because people are working hard. And they can't save, and they can't get ahead. And that's great if they can go toward the Republican Party. I don't wish ill on either Trump or Biden, but I just want both of them to go away so we can have a new choice. Deborah:It's made me ashamed for people to know I'm a Republican and that I voted for Trump. I've always tried to feel like I voted for the man, not the party. And I really thought Trump had potential, that he was going to help the United States. And he gets in office, and it turns out he's just an insane dirty old man. And I'm creeped out. Moderator: Ten years from now, do you think it will be more like Trump or less like Trump? Chad: It's either going to work or it's going to blow up in their face. For better or for worse, it'll be a different party. Sara: When I look at young people today and hear some of the stuff that comes out of their mouths, I think, they are our future politicians? They don't even understand the Constitution. Mike: Maybe we need to go back toward working with Democrats and independents, and seeing what we can actually get done to make the country get better. Moderator: Let's talk about the indictments. How many of you think that former President Trump likely committed a crime? [Ten people raise a hand.] Carrie: Would normal D.A.s be going after a person for this kind of stuff? I don't know. All the people that are going after him are so politicized. Pamela: With the First Amendment, Trump will say that he has a right to say whatever he wants. And in the long run, if it goes all the way to the Supreme Court, he'll get off. But it'll be on our tax dollars. John: On the documents case, for any other person, that person would be in jail right now. That one seems like a slam dunk to me. And the other ones, I believe he's guilty as well. The Jan. 6 trial as well. The Georgia one. Reed: Is he guilty of a crime? Absolutely. Is it even the crimes that they're charging him with or trying him for? I don't know. I do think that he has at some point committed one or more felonies and/or misdemeanor crimes. Charla: He's gotten off for so many years that he just thinks he's going to get off of this too. Reed: The rich people get off of everything. Mike: The violation of his oath of office and the 14th Amendment -- promising to protect and preserve the United States and then inciting a riot -- that should disqualify him. Let's talk about specific candidates. How do you feel about Ron DeSantis? Carrie: I liked the way he handled the pandemic. He's very clear on what he stands for. He'd be a fine president. Rodney: A lot of negative stuff has been said about him. He just seems really iffy. Amanda: My sister lives in Florida, and he just seems like a bit of a lunatic. With the pandemic and what's a mask. The stuff with education and this whole stuff with Disney. Any time I hear stuff like that, I automatically think of Trump, and then I think, nope. Charla: That exact thing. And I've heard so many things about him trying to take kids and split up families, just because he doesn't agree with the way that they are doing their particular household. It's their household. Leave them alone. They're not hurting the kids. Why are you trying to separate families? He acts crazy like Trump. Moderator: What about Nikki Haley? Mike: She seems to tell it like it is. I watched the first debate, and she was the one who was saying that a nationwide ban on abortion isn't something we could get past Congress. She also seems to have a strong grasp of foreign policy, with what's going on in Ukraine. Pamela: She's fake. Moderator: Fake? Pamela: Yeah, I know people that know her. She does really good with talking points. But if you go outside the questions she's prepared for, she has no answer. Rodney: But maybe a woman might shake things up a little bit, who knows? Carrie: I feel excited about Haley because she's had experience. She's had foreign policy experience, which is, like Mike was saying, a huge plus. She knows her way around Washington, but she doesn't seem like an insider. Sara:I like her. She's part of a military family. She understands. I mean, her husband's deployed right now. She did great for our state when she was governor. John:Mike made some good points. The thing about her that I don't like is she's wishywashy. She'll come out on an issue, and then 30 days later, she's on the other side of it. Moderator: What about Mike Pence? Chad: With what he had to deal with, with who was his president, I think he did a decent job at trying to manage that and temper that. Rodney: He knows what not to do. Deborah: He's a good Christian family man. He has a moral compass and he never let Trump's craziness rush over him. Alex: He was kind of like Trump's puppet, and now he's saying, all of a sudden, that he's opposed to him, even though he wasn't, just so he can become president. He's disloyal. Moderator: How about Vivek Ramaswamy? Pamela: Well, when he first came out, I was encouraged by him. And then, he started talking about getting rid of the F.B.I. and already saying he'll pardon Trump. Andreia: First of all, he's too young. I'm sorry. I'm like a hair older than he is. But he's 38. He doesn't know anything. He talks too much about the woke stuff. He's totally paying attention to the wrong thing. John: He's a phony. Mehdi Hasan ripped him apart in an interview, just couldn't get him to answer a straight question about what he said about Trump. He would not answer it. He's out there for himself. Moderator: What about Tim Scott? Mike: I don't know where he stands on the issues. He's mostly kept his name out of the newspapers or off the internet. So that's a positive thing. Sara: I don't know if he's the bulldog that the Republicans need, that the country needs. I'm just a little iffy about him. He does great for the state. I don't know how that would translate as a president. Reed: He has a lot of great ideas. He is charismatic. He's outgoing. But at the same time, he was extremely pro-Trump for a long time there. And for me, I don't identify Trump as a Republican. I identify him as a psychopath. Carrie: He has an amazing backstory, a story of how he came up from poverty. But for a presidential election, that's not going to get you to the big time. Moderator: What about Chris Christie? John: At first, I really thought he had a chance. But now, I don't think so. But he is the anti-Trump, and that's why I'll support him. Andreia: He does have experience in government. So he piques my interest. Charla: A long time ago, he did some things that I disagreed with, so he's not my man. Mike: I'm not against Chris Christie. I just don't know where he stands on the issues other than the issue of Trump. He spends so much time talking about Trump that I don't know where he stands on abortion, states' rights, the economy, any of the other talking points that are out there. Moderator: If you could design a Republican candidate for president, what kind of person would you like to see run? Charla: Honest, stands by their word. Alex: Yeah, somebody who's honest, somebody who's going to help the economy. Chad: My perfect, ideal candidate would be somebody who is younger and new to the scene, so at that point in time, maybe like early 40s, and somebody who grew up more in this generation or this century than last century and is somebody who's versed with what's going on in today's society. Mike: Ronald Reagan would be great. Can you find him? Carrie: I was actually thinking that, too. Can we bring back Reagan? Pamela: I think Reagan and W. Put them together. That would be the perfect candidate. John: No, I agree with Mike. I would have said bring Reagan back. Rodney: Reagan."
