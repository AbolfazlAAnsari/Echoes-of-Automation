That precedent and the Justice Departmentpolicyhave left the United States with what seems an untenable situation - presidents are immune from prosecution in office and politically untouchable after leaving office.\"To be sure, there has been an increased willingness on Capitol Hill to deploy thepower of impeachmentagainst sitting presidents. But using the law remained off limits - until Trump tested that status quo. Special Counsel Jack Smith has now put forth a rebuttal to Ford's monumental decision, making the case that prosecutorial action against a former president is a legitimate move.While the bar must remain extraordinarily high for any administration to take legal action against a former president, it is a necessary response in the case of Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election. When the alleged crimes are so egregious that they threaten the stability of our democracy, accountability is vital.The indictment is merely one step in a long-term process that is needed to reinstate the guardrails on presidential power that have been broken in recent decades, particularly by the previous administration.How voters will react to the charges and the outcome of the ensuing trial remains an open question. When69%of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe Biden's 2020 election win was not legitimate, Trump's latest charges are unlikely to harm his standing, at least in the GOP primaries. In fact, it is very possible that Trump continues to benefit from the indictments since they play into the narrative he's crafted of being a victim who is constantly fighting back against the establishment.But the calculus for the decision to charge Trump shouldn't rest on the former president's political fate. Rather, we need to take a long-term view and consider how we can better hold presidents - present and former - accountable. By this standard, the impact of this week's decision has the potential to be a turning point in US history, nearly 50 years after Ford pardoned Nixon.By Julian Zelizer, CNNTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
