Those supplies have beenvital to Ukraine's continued survivaldespite criticism of Washington's hesitancy over specific weapons systems.But now these flows too have been interdicted by elements of the US Congress determined to prioritise domestic political point-scoring over the future of the global system that underpins US prosperity. And Ukraine's military leadership can't make realistic plans while it remainsunclear what military equipment will be available to implement them.For all the disconnect between a timid White House, a recalcitrant Congress and a US military which by contrast remainsfully focused on enabling Ukraine to evict the Russian invasion force, the evidence lies in the actions, not the words of the United States.That evidence supports only one conclusion: the US political establishment has assessed that enabling Ukraine to defeat Russia is not in the broader strategic interest of the United States. That indicates an inability or unwillingness to recognizethedire consequences for the US and the West overall of Russian success.There are disturbing parallels with the period leading up to the Second World War. Strong isolationist voices in the US argue that wars far away are of no concern at home. Others bicker over which challenge needs to be faced, as if there is a choice - with Russia and China now taking the place of 1930s Germany and Japan.In the meantime, the US may have hoped that non-escalatory measures - like economic sanctions, and a cautious and incremental approach to arming Ukraine - would be sufficient to settle a strategic confrontation with Russia. If so, this has manifestly failed.As so consistently throughout the conflict, the UK is at least saying the right thing andcalling for Ukraine to be enabled to defeat Russia rather than merely survive. Europe too, shocked awake by the threat to US support, now says it aims toramp up production of weapons to help Ukraine- welcome news, even if long overdue.But that is not a substitute for a much deeper change of mindset on how to deal with Russia. And with the US out of the picture as the leader of a coalition of the unwilling, there is an opportunity for others to step up. Front-line states like Poland,acutely aware of the existential nature of the threat, can take a greater role in changing how the West as a whole understands the conflict - not just in open combat in Ukraine, but in the wider war Russia is waging on the global system that has kept Europe safe for decades.Defending that system will be complex, messy and expensive, and involvehard choicesfor both Europe and North America.But in Russia's terror campaign in Ukraine's skies today, the equation is brutally simple: the less willing the West is to show Russia its actions have consequences, the more Ukrainian men, women and children will die.Opinion by Keir GilesTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
