When labor unions asked to join the council, they were told, “No.”Now, for the first time in decades, labor unions have a strong voice in Washington: President Joe Biden.Robert E. McGarrah Jr.Bethesda, Md.The writer, an attorney with Maryland Legal Aid, was counsel to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Office of Investment.Ukraine’s Fate, and the World’sTo the Editor:Re “I Saw Firsthand How Much Is at Stake in Ukraine,” by Thomas L. Friedman, and “Can Samantha Power Change Ukraine’s Future?,” by Bret Stephens (columns, Sept. 17):Mr. Friedman and Mr. Stephens outdid themselves with their heartfelt and insightful firsthand accounts of the importance of events in Ukraine. I read them both twice.It’s truly inspiring that Ukrainians have united so courageously in the face of imperialist aggression that the civilized world had assumed was a disgraceful relic of history. The United States and Europe must help them win that fight.American politics may present its frustrations, but what is happening in Ukraine is something of an entirely different level of importance to the world.There are so many reasons that a second Trump presidency would be disastrous for America. But tragically, a return to power for Donald Trump, with his affinity for Vladimir Putin, would delay the eventual inevitable triumph of individual freedom over state-imposed tyranny for years. The future of human history is in the balance.George HicksNashvilleA ‘Misguided’ Effort to Promote Diversity at CollegesTo the Editor:Re “Diversity Statements by Faculty Complicate Hiring on Campus” (front page, Sept. 10):In 1950, the California state university system required all employees to sign an anti-Communistloyalty oath, which resulted in the firing of professors unwilling to sign. More than 70 years later, the very same institutions requirean acceptably worded D.E.I. statementas a condition to hiring.While today’s goals may be laudable, an ideological litmus test of any kind is both misguided and an unconstitutional infringement on free speech.Daniel WolfTeaneck, N.J.To the Editor:This article prompts the hypothetical question whether a latter-day Albert Einstein would have a chance of employment at Berkeley or a number of other University of California campuses.When asked about his commitment to diversity, that world-class physicist would likely give a response along the lines of these words he once said: “I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university.”That fails, on Berkeley’s scoring rubric, to indicate sufficient alignment with the ideology the college expects all faculty to share. And that would be the end of the applicant’s candidacy in almost every instance.U.C.’s research universities have been home to many of America’s greatest scientists and scholars. Now several of them privilege activism when recruiting new faculty and otherwise do not even bother to consider the research and teaching records of applicants.Research universities are the engines of scientific and technological progress, but U.C. has instead embraced dysfunctional ideological conformity.Michael B.
