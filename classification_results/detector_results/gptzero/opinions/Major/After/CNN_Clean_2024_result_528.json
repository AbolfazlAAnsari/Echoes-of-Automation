Martha Bailey, an economics professor at the University of California Los Angeles,led a study that also foundthat expanding access to birth control reduces abortion.Greater numbers of younger people embraced permanent contraception like tubal ligation and vasectomies after the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision overturning Roe, according toa studypublished by JAMA Health Forum. Yet about half of women who get abortionsreport they weren't even using contraceptionduring the month of their impregnation.The GOP should build on the work Republican women are undertaking to expand access to over-the-counter contraceptives, including through theOrally Taken Contraception Act of 2023. The bill, introduced last year by nine female Republican House members, \"expands access to over-the-counter contraceptives by increasing regulatory clarity to promote competition, and provides women with options for preventative health care,\" according to a statement put out by the sponsors.It is unfortunately the case that some in the pro-life community, particularly Catholics, oppose birth control. I respectfully disagree, and I'm not alone. Even 83% of US Catholics want the church to allow the use of contraception,Pew reported.I hope that more of those who oppose abortion will come to see providing contraception as crucial to the cause of reducing abortions.Democrats, meanwhile, shouldn't exaggerate the Dobbs decision as paving the way for banning contraception. The Supreme Court inGriswold v. Connecticutrecognized open access to birth control back in 1965. Andthe Dobbs majority rulingexplicitly mentions Griswold, saying, \"The Court emphasizes that this decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\" Justice Clarence Thomas in his Dobbs concurrence did say that Griswold should be reconsidered. However, it's a moot point because he was the only justice out of nine to raise the issue.There are legitimate freedom of religion concerns over whether religious groups can be forced to pay for birth control for their employees, such as theLittle Sisters of the PoorandHobby Lobby. But exempting private organizations from paying for birth control is far different from universal or government restriction on access to birth control itself.Sadly,long gone are the daysof former President Bill Clinton, who popularized the call to make abortions \"safe, legal and rare.\" Now, some on the left supportmeasures that would allow for late-term abortionsandrefuse to give a cutoff datefor the procedure.A bipartisan focus on prevention could go a long way toward bridging divides. Helping women - and men - prevent unwanted pregnancies is a strong message that should be embraced by both Republicans and Democrats. It's good for politics, but most importantly, it's good for women and their families.Opinion by Carrie SheffieldTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
