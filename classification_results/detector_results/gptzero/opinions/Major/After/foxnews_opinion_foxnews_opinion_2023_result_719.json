Only a tiny 5% support Republicans.Some federal workers in high positions slow-walk or even derail a Republican president's agenda — and get away with it.Why bother to vote if the left-leaning deep state stays in charge no matter who wins the presidency?GOP candidatesDonald Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis are vowing to conquer this obstructionism.Everett Kelley, union president of the American Federation of Government Employees, claims GOP contenders want to \"politicize routine government work.\" Nonsense. We're not talking about mail carriers. It's time to make lawyers, PhDs and other top-level career bureaucrats implement the president's agenda, not their own.After Trump won in 2016, they went to town neutralizing him on almost every policy front, explains James Sherk, special assistant to the White House Domestic Policy Council under Trump.WHAT ARE THE FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS?Career lawyers in theDepartment of Justice's Civil Rights Divisionflat out refused to challenge Yale University's discrimination against Asian American applicants. Trump had to recruit lawyers from other divisions. After Joe Biden became president, the DOJ dropped the case. But the same career lawyers who refused to sue Yale made the losing argument in support of affirmative action before the U.S. Supreme Court.Career health officials likeDr. Deborah Birxcircumvented Trump's instructions to moderate COVID lockdowns. Environmental Protection Agency lawyers pursued cases against fossil fuel producers and withheld the information from Trump appointees.Dr. Deborah Birx served as the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator under President Donald Trump from 2020 to 2021.Trump mandated in a 2020 executive order that new federal buildings be designed to please the public, which prefers classical designs. Instead, General Services Administration architects chose modern designs they like. Trump mentioned as an example the San Francisco Federal Building, the ugliest edifice in the city.It goes on, includingweaponization of the FBIagainst the president himself.In October 2020, Trump issued an executive order that federal workers who make policy should be reclassified as at-will employees who can be terminated.But before it could be implemented, Biden became president.

But merit is largely gone. Scramble those five letters and what you've got is the \"timer\" system.Federal workersget bigger salaries and fatter benefits than private-sector workers doing comparable jobs. And they almost never lose their job, no matter how derelict they are. They put in their time and skate to a gold-plated retirement package.It's a gravy train, paid for by John Q Public. That's sickening enough. But it's even worse when these civil \"servants\" put their own leftist leanings ahead of the president and public they're paid to serve.Bravo to the GOP candidates pledging to take on the deep state — replete with deadbeats and lefties — and return government to the people. It's a worthy fight.Shame on Biden for protecting bureaucracy instead of democracy.Not in America.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM BETSY McCAUGHEYBetsy McCaughey is a former lieutenant governor of New York and chairman of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths.
