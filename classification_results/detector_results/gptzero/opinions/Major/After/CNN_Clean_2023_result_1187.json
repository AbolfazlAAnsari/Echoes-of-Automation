The trio of eruptions in as many years were touted as \"tourist eruptions\" - far from infrastructure and safe to view if you were up for a 10 kilometer hike.We could feel the larger quakes here in Reykjavik, too. Now, in a sturdier concrete home, I could hear shockwaves approaching like a large truck speeding down the street before slamming into the building with a jolt and rolling on.The 140,000 of us living in the capital experienced the most recent activity on Reykjanes peninsula much the same. The odd jolt or occasional rumble.But the most recent burst of seismic activity that began on October 25 was different for the people of Grindavik. Rather than quirky news stories of residents taking sea sickness tablets to cope with the constantly moving Earth, the epicentre had moved beneath the town, described by one resident toThe Reykjavik Grapevineas a \"monster under their feet.\"That monster was restless, causing tens of thousands of earthquakes before throwing a tantrum on November 10 that repeatedly pulled the ground from under people's feet. It was late that night that the 3,700 residents of Grindavik were ordered to evacuate.The monster had burrowed a 15-kilometre lava tunnel that stretched beneath the town. It then promptly went to sleep, leaving the nation to wonder if it was all a false alarm.But it wasn't.Nobody is in harm's way now and early activity is giving volcanologists hope that the lava flow will spare Grindavik. But the explosive nature of this country straddling tectonic plates, and its potential impact on humans, has once again been brought to the fore.Not since the Westman Islands awoke to an eruption in their backyard in 1973 has an entire town been evacuated. Now everyone waits and watches and wonders if residents of Grindavik will ever go back home. Will they even want to?I remember my first volcano. The long and dramatic lead up to the Sundhnukagigar eruption will cement it in my memory, too.Opinion by Catharine FultonTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
