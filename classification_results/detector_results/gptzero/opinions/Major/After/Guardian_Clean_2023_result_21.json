I’m not sure I can imagine a similar title ever being written about babies. Books about parenting (and I include my own) are all called things such as The Most Awful Thing I’ve Ever Done, or Why Did Nobody Tell Me This Was So Utterly Crap? or How the Hell Did This Happen?We’re tearing ourselves apart with self-deprecation, self-doubt, guilt and anxiety, while cat and dog owners particularly are just out there, indulged and celebrated in their adoration of their furry dependents. Buying dog-friendly ice-cream, setting up Instagram accounts for their Bengal cat, employing pet psychologists because their dog keeps eating out of the bathroom bin, getting kangaroo meat imported from Australia because regular beef upsets their pet’s tummy.Now, I hate a binary and I also hate like-minded people being intentionally pitted against each other by cynical members of the press. But, as a parent, I do find the modern attitude to pets a little strange. I have worked in four places where they either had an office dog or you could take your dog into work; I have never worked anywhere that provided on-site childcare. I have had people introduce their pets to me as “my handsome son” or “my beautiful baby” but then complain that their social media feed is “full of people’s kids”. I have been told that parenting is a “niche” area of interest (81% of women will have a baby by the time they reach 45), while pets have “mass appeal” (just 62% of households in the UK own a pet). The very people who balk or yawn at colleagues discussing their children in the office will often then regale you with stories of their cats sitting on their shoulders or dogs eating peanut butter.When I searched the words “pet camera” online, I found a cool 1,010,000,000 results, including something called the Furbo Dog Camera. This little number retails at a hefty £199 and includes not just a 360-degree wide-angle lens, two-way audio, barking alert and cloud recording, but also – this is the one that really got me – “100 piece capacity Fun Treat Tossing technology”. You can now buy a video camera full of dry, reconstituted meat chunks that will sit in the middle of your living room and film, track and feed your dog while you go out and earn that necessary £199. If you’d like something more personal, you could pay about the same for a week’s “doggy daycare”.

Perhaps this apparent preference shouldn’t be surprising. After all, domesticated animals are far, far less dependent on you for physical, emotional or psychological support than babies and children. They don’t hit you with years of hormonal fury during toddlerhood and adolescence, don’t learn to talk, don’t develop challenging political views, fall in love with drug dealers or steal your record collection.
