That's a story that has been told around the world, but the evidence from Australia suggests the opposite is true. As well as the Murdoch press, small outlets(https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/country-press-australia-can-collectively-bargain-with-google-and-facebook) in Australia have? benefited.Indeed, Rod Sims, the former chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, told Canadian senators, \"The smaller players got more money per journalist employed than the larger companies. The myth that is put out about that, that the small publishers missed out, is just that; it's a myth. They did very well. Country Press Australia is extremely pleased with its deals.\"Speaking to the benefits of Australia's News Media Bargaining Code, which the Canadian bill is modelled on, Sims said publishers are receiving \"well over AU$200 million per annum for deals that run from four to five years each.\" He added, \"We only recently got some data that showed that there was a 50 per cent increase in the hiring of journalists post the code deals being done.\"Because interest in the code has spread, with similar bills up for discussion in the U.S. and Brazil, Google has quietly threatened to drop local news in Italy and other countries where discussion has taken place.It's a game of brinkmanship as the platforms try to flex their muscles and? the threat \"backfired\" in Australia, says Sims, who designed the Australian code.In 2014, Spain's main publishers' association lobbied the government to introduce a so-called \"Google tax,\" modifying an existing intellectual property law to require news aggregators to pay publishers for linking to their content. The money earned from licensing fees was to be paid to all publishers through a collective rights mechanism managed by a third entity. All Spanish outlets were to receive a share, both large and small.\"This law was considered the best approach for a majority of European publishers,\" says Luis Enríquez Nistal, current CEO at Vocento and the president of the publishers association when the law was passed. And he adds, \"it became the worst communications problem Google ever faced.\"In response to the new law, Google decided to shut down Google News in Spain, which meant that links to all Spanish news were excluded from its news aggregator, joining Denmark(https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/google-news-europe-eu.php), which? had not been part of Google News in the first place for the same reason.The change to Spanish law sparked a division among the country's publishers. Digital natives opposed the licensing fees, arguing that they would undermine their websites as they relied on Google News for traffic.NP View: The right approach to countering Big Tech's monopolistic practices(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/np-view-the-right-approach-to-countering-big-techs-monopolistic-practices)Emma McDonald: Big Tech will threaten, but Canada doesn't have to listen(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/emma-mcdonald-big-tech-will-threaten-but-canada-doesnt-have-to-listen)Today, the large Spanish publishers say that being dropped from Google News?didn't have a big effect on their business. Some publishers we spoke to say the measure was revenue neutral. Others said publishers benefited from having more control over their relationships with their readers and advertisers.Google News was restored(https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-news-re-opens-spain-after-eight-year-shutdown-2022-06-22/) in Spain in 2022, after an eight-year hiatus. This came about because in the legislative process for the implementation of EU copyright rules, the Spanish current government amended the 2014 clause to allow media outlets to negotiate directly with the tech giant.José Antonio Sánchez, founder and CEO of El Confidencial, the largest digital native, says the lesson is to rely on direct traffic that is not filtered through search.?\"I only believe in frequent, loyal readers who visit our site directly, not via Google.\" He definitely agrees that publishers need to unite against big tech. \"The?pioneering Spanish law of 2014 could have made a huge impact if the publishers had been united.\"Perhaps this is the best lesson for Canada to learn from the Spanish example: publishers - both digital and legacy - do not allow yourselves to be divided and conquered. Unite, stand firm and negotiate hard to get fair payments from the platforms that benefit from circulating news. While bargaining codes are not perfectly designed, the case of Spain suggests that they are likely better to support quality journalism than the alternative.Postmedia NewsDr. Anya Schiffrin is a senior lecturer at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs and writes regularly on bargaining codes.
