The United States may want topivot awayfrom the Middle East, but the Middle East refuses to play along.Iran, which for years has supported Hamas withmoney and weapons, has a strong stake in how this plays out in the weeks, months and even years ahead. So far, neither the US nor Israel have found direct evidence linkingTehranto the attack, but the White House has described Iran as \"broadly complicit\" as a full-fledged sponsor of Hamas. Israel and the US are being circumspect, because if they do find a smoking gun, if they make the accusation, that could amount to a casus belli, a justification for war, and they don't want another head-on confrontation at this moment. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei praised Hamas for the operation but, perhaps betraying some anxiety,publicly deniedinvolvement in the attacks.And yet, this war could end up turning into a triumph for Tehran, a fervently fundamentalist, anti-Western dictatorship that has threatened to destroy Israel and has workedto encircle itwith a ring of militant organizations in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria, all the whiledepriving its own peopleof many basic rights.The goals of Hamas, whose founding charter commits it to thedestruction of Israel,align neatly with those of Iran'stheocracy. Both Iran and the Palestinians have watched with alarm thegrowing tiesbetween Israel and its Arab neighbors. Whatever the principal objective of Hamas' operation, it's reasonable to believe that derailing that process, particularly the prospect offriendly ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, entered the calculation.The perpetrators undoubtedly expect an implacable reaction from Israel, which would help to derail the process, with images of Palestinians killed by Israeli bombs filling the screens of Arab citizens everywhere, sparking outrage and making it far more difficult, perhaps impossible, for the Saudis to draw closer to Israel. With Arab publics watching images of carnage in Gaza, the terrorist logic goes, it becomes politically impossible for Arab leaders to draw closer to Israel.An end to the normalization process would be a victory for Iran, and a victory for Iran - now a member of the anti-American, anti-Westernaxis of autocrats, alongside China and Russia - is the last thing the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia want.Iran and Saudi Arabia recentlyestablished diplomatic relations, but the long-standing rivalry and mistrust between them, as the standard bearers of Islam's two main divisions, Shiites and Sunnis, did not suddenly disappear.If Riyadh were to announce that the talks with Israel are not dead, it would face strong blowback from many quarters, at home and abroad. But Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS), is not exactly risk averse.To ease the path for reconciliation with Saudi Arabia - and for other important reasons, including the promotion of stability at home, and the need to one day solve the conflict with Palestinians - Israeli leaders should be talking to Palestinians in the West Bank, probing the possibility of working together on a path forward. It all seems barely fathomable now, but it will be necessary.Indeed, of the three difficult goals, this one may be the most difficult. MBS may be prepared to face popular anger, but the head of the Palestinian Authority, President Mahmoud Abbas, is not. Now in the18th year of a four-year term, he is deeply unpopular, his position tenuous.Many Israelis, too, will bristle at the notion of compromise with Palestinians, after having seen their men, women, children, toddlers, babies and elders massacred, and not hearing any condemnation from the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah.If Israel's peace camp had already grown weaker over the years, Hamas has only made it more so.But nothing has weakened Israel more than its internal divisions, which tore the country apart after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brought into his coalition right-wing extremist figures -the only wayhe could hold on to power. Interestingly, one of them, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was Israel's minister of national security when the country was caught totally unprepared.For months, Israelis had beenprotesting against a judicial overhaul- a judicial \"coup,\" as critics called it - promoted by Netanyahu's ruling coalition, which would severely weaken checks and balances in the country, corroding its democratic underpinnings.On Wednesday, in the midst of this crisis, the most serious one Israel has faced in decades, Netanyahu and former defense minister Benny Gantz announced anemergency unity government. That's the first step in bringing the country back together. But that road, too, is long and steep. Israelis face wrenching dilemmas, and they havediametrically opposed viewsabout how to solve them. If there's something they surely all agree about today, it's that those deep divisions made the country more vulnerable.As the fighting rages on, the emotions are intense. Grief, anger, fear. But those whose job is to look beyond the immediate challenge, to consider the future beyond the crisis and look for ways to prevent it from returning in an even more devastating shape, must find a way to create a diplomatic and political miracle on the other side of the current nightmare.Opinion by Frida GhitisTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
