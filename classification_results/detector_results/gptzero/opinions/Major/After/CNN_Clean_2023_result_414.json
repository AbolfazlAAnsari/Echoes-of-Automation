Since older teenagers are legally permitted to work, drive vehicles and pay federal income taxes, they should be able to have a say on those issues and others.Indeed, the inclusion of ever more younger people in the political process could be just the thing to rejuvenate democracy and shift the sights of politicos to new topics.TheEuropean Youth Forum, a platform of over a hundred youth organizations in Europe that endorses voting at 16, wants a voice on youth rights, standards for internships, taxation, educational opportunities abroad, sustainability and digitalization. The US-based NGO NationalYouth Rights Associationargues that 16- and 17-year-olds should participate on decision making on medical autonomy, curfew, drinking age and age discrimination.\"Decisions on the transformation in our transportation system, the end of fossil fuels and the urgent clean energy transition can't be made without us,\" Linda Kastrup of the climate movement group Fridays for Future told me. \"The future of our country should be determined by all the people who will be living in it.\"Studies showthat this segment of the population is every bit as capable of understanding the issues at stake as older people. And, as the human beings who will live the longest on this earth, they have a disproportionate interest in determining its conditions.Evidencefrom Europeunderscores that extending voting rights to young people promotes higher turnout for first-time voters - and that they also then participate more regularly in the future, too.\"When the government makes decisions about education, the environment and war and peace, young people are affected for more years of their lives than any other age demographic,\"arguesNeil Bhateja of the National Youth Rights Association, an advocacy group.\"They work and are subject to taxation without representation: income tax, sales tax, payroll taxes and more... The US should continue its democratic tradition of extending voting rights,\" he added.Like the oceans, they riseNo recent event speaks more loudly for the right of young people to participate in our political decision-making processes than the climate school strikes held around the world since 2019.The grave concerns of millions of school-age kids in125 countrieswas on display when they joined the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg in skipping school on Fridays and taking to the streets to demonstrate against climate inaction - on behalf of their generation. These young people consciously broke the rules, committing a bold act of civil disobedience, for the reason that they felt their voices and interests were going unheard in the halls of power.The sea of determined young faces in Berlin and London, Bogota and Nairobi, illustrated their deep-seated concern that decisions impacting the planet's health - and thus their futures - were being made by people with less to lose than themselves.Increasing extreme weather events stand to impact the decades ahead, when they'll have their own families, in an ever more profound way.In Berlin, on the eve of the 2019 European Parliament elections, young activists, addressing demonstrators from a podium at Brandenburg Gate, beseeched their elders to \"vote for on our behalf because we can't vote.\" Elsewhere around the world at school strikes, posters and signs read: \"Our future is on your shoulders,\" \"The oceans are rising and so are we,\" \"Vote for climate\" and \"We are voting now!\"The sophistication of the global climate movement and its demands is the most convincing evidence that these young people are capable of making intelligent, considered choices. Let's open this political space to them, just as the right to cast ballots has been opened to so many diverse groups since its inception in ancient Greece thousands of years ago.Opinion by Paul HockenosTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
