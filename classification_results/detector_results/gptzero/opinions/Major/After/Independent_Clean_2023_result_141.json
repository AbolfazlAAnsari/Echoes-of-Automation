Currently, our infrastructure is severely compromised, strikes are everywhere, incompetent government, andindebtedness at an unheard-of level, the list of trauma this country is experiencing is depressingly extraordinary.Some of the few expandingopportunities are food banks,crisis/depression centers, and petty crime. Some supermarkets have even taken totagging food productsto reduce the exponential rise of shoplifting.There is no happy ending for Brexit and those that continue to peddle the lie that we needed to leave the European Union to improve our standard of living and regain our sovereignty need to return to the stone they have been living under.Keith PooleBasingstokeIf Braverman is guilty of anything it’s a serious lack of judgementAssuming Suella Braverman isn’t short of a few quid and relatively speaking is a sharp operator, I’m struggling to understand why she initially chose the ignominy ofa speed awareness courserather than take the easy route, suck up the points, and pay the fine.I can only assume it’s one of two things that has triggered this aberration; she’s either a consummate penny pincher or she’s totting up points andgetting close to a ban.  The opposition’s shrill indignation is a tour de force, and while it’s irritating to see ministers try and wriggle out of things, Yvette Cooper’s been carrying on as though Suella Braverman has kicked an entire litter of puppies.If she’s guilty of anything it’s a serious lack of judgment and self-awareness and that seems to be an issue for such a major cabinet minister.Squirming out of a speed awareness course isn’t a crime, but repeatedly telling us she’s\"delivering for the British people\"ought to be.Steve MackinderDenverThe money myth won’t work anymoreKeir Starmer’splans for the NHSare indeed admirable but how people ask, will he be able to afford this, apart from a few tweaks to the tax system affecting the rich? The answer is obvious if we can afford to shell out torescue the banksafter their years of reckless gambling, then finding money for the NHS shouldn’t be a problem. A lot of the money myth has now been exposed for the myth it is.Geoff ForwardStirling"
