He eventually would parlay an immense talent, professional connections, luck, extraordinary attachment to expressive culture and his whiteness into an enormously successful entertainment career. He materially shattered all expectations associated with his social rank.His significance arguably went beyond accumulated fame and fortune. It sometimes is easy to forget that before he became \"Elvis,\" he was just a kid who turned to music, movies and fashion because he wanted to escape invisibility and anonymity.Like countless adolescents who have succeeded him, he was a passionate consumer whose consumption knew few bounds. And Elvis Presley helped reveal that consumerism - despite its many drawbacks - has the potential to break down barriers that separate people.The Presley legacy, however, is about perception. And Elvis is perceived by many through a lens that focuses on a supposed backward culture he refused to abandon.In a nation whose story emphasizes progress and always moving forward, such a refusal was an unpardonable sin, a punishable lapse. Therefore, any revolutionary impact he may have had was accompanied and negated by an asterisk that lampooned him as a\"Hillbilly on a Pedestal,\"\"a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party\"and the\"King of White Trash Culture.\"That perception, of course, is contested. For the mourners in 1977 who filed past his casket, those who have bought over1 billion of his recordingsand the countless people today who are grieving the loss of his daughter, Elvis Presley was a rags-to-riches hero who personified the American dream.In the days before her death, Lisa Marie Presley attended ananniversary celebration of her father's birthand aGolden Globe Awards showthat presented a best actor trophy toAustin Butler,who had portrayed her father in last summer's blockbuster motion picture \"Elvis.\" Surely the thoughts of the Presley legacy crossed her mind.As we think about her life, it is difficult not to see that legacy as a distinctively American one. Perhaps we should revisit the lament that a Presley's death deprives our nation of a part of itself.Opinion by Michael T. BertrandTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
