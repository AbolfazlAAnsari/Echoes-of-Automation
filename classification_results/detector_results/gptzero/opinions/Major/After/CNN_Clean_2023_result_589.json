The indictment paints an incredibly damning picture, alleging an organized attempt by the former president and his allies to undermine the fabric of American democracy - something even the most sympathetic defendant will not easily be able to fight. Trump has denied wrongdoing, as have the other defendants who have made public statements to date.The indictment is sweeping, invoking Georgia's version of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and 40 other counts. Georgia's RICO law is a vehicle by which prosecutorscan chargethose committing crimes with acting as part of a larger criminal enterprise - and is the most important difference from special counsel Jack Smith's federalelection interference case.In the distant past, RICO was usedprimarily in mafia casesor against drug organizations, but more recently, prosecutors have used it to chargestreet gangs, political organizations and even more loosely aligned groups of people who organize themselves for the purpose of committing crimes.While this Georgia indictment does not provide the easy-to-read narrative that Smith gave us in the federal election interference case, the evidence here was exhaustively collected over more than two years. Willis and her team then laid it out in painstaking detail, noting which of the 19 defendants participated in the161 charged actionsunder RICO.The indictment describes eight ways in which the enterprise intended to achieve its criminal goals, including: making false statements to state legislators; making false statements to state officials; the fake electors scheme; the harassment and intimidation of election workers like Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss; soliciting the Justice Department to make false statements; soliciting the vice president to unlawfully reject Electoral College votes; the unlawful breach ofelection equipmentin Coffee County; and obstruction of justice to cover up the conspiracy.In both Georgia and under federal law, RICOrequires prosecutors to provethe existence of and defendants' membership in an enterprise with criminal goals and a pattern of racketeering activity, defined by reference to a lengthy list of criminal statutes, which are called \"predicate acts.\" To be convicted, each defendant must participate in two or more predicate acts, and Willis has charged that all 19 defendants committed two or more of the predicate acts as listed inthe first countof the indictment.The non-RICO charges, counts two though 41, mirror the predicate acts underlying the RICO offense and include soliciting a violation of oath by a public officer, false statements and writings, impersonating a public officer, forgery, perjury and conspiracies to defraud the state and to commit election fraud.Georgia's RICO statutediffers from the federal version, however, in ways that made it applicable to the defendants' conduct in Georgia, when it would not have been applicable in the federal system. In Georgia, the list of predicate acts that compriseracketeering activityis lengthy, and includes the offenses listed above, which were a fit for the defendants' conduct. In the federal RICO statute, the definition ofracketeering activitydoes not include crimes that are a good fit for the defendants' conduct, with the exception of one: obstruction of justice.The use of RICO carries various benefits for prosecutors, including the ability to bring in evidence that otherwise might not be admissible in terms of geographic scope and timeframe, and the ability to tell a coherent and comprehensive story about the actions of all members of the enterprise, even if defendants exit the case before trial. For example, Willis charged dozens of overt acts that were committed in Washington, DC, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada and elsewhere. Importantly, even if the defendants to whom these and other acts are linked drop out of the case, Willis will be entitled to put in evidence of these incidents as part of the racketeering activity.RICO also carries sentencing benefits. A conviction under Georgia's RICO lawwould carrya mandatory minimum prison sentence offive years, and most of the other 40 charges in the indictment likewise involve mandatory minimum sentences of one year.None of the other charged cases include amandatory minimum, upping the stakes for a Georgia conviction not only for Trump, but his co-conspirators, who will be deciding in the coming weeks and months whether they want to take a plea deal that might help them avoid this consequence by allowing them to plead to a count without mandatory minimum penalties.But charging a RICO case isn't the only benefit afforded to Willis.

Under Georgia law, a state pardon can only be given by a state pardon board - not the governor - and only afterfive yearshave passed following completion of the sentence.In other words, unlike the federal indictments obtained by Smith, Trump winning the presidency again is not the death knell for Willis' case, just like it is not forManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's case. Still, though a 2024 Trump win would not categorically end prosecution in either state's jurisdiction, there are a variety ofunsettled constitutional and other legal questionsabout whether a sitting presidency can and should be put on trial during his presidency.Opinion by Jennifer RodgersTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
