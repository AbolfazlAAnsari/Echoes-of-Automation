It tells us everything we need to know about his misplaced priorities.They have targeted the oil and gas industry at every opportunity, from executive orders curtailing leasing on federal land to the so-called \"Inflation Reduction Act\" that contained more than $369 billion dollars of green giveaways.Even if the overall budget is dead on arrival, Congress can use its constitutionally allotted powers to kill the Biden Climate Corps before it launches, and let’s hope they seize the moment. Republicans have complained mightily about the weaponization of government and the targeting of political opponents. Thousands of young people door-to-door canvasing for climate change will be both.We should not spend tax dollars so Gen Zers can knock on the doors of those deemed in need of climate change education, nor should it be gathering signatures of those who support their agenda.A program the size of the Climate Corps, without congressional approval, must be stopped as blatantly unconstitutional. Failure to do so undermines the rule of law and threatens an industry so vital to our economy and national security.
