While most prosecutors try to do the right thing, we cannot ignore the fact that prosecutors are imperfect humans, some of whom who do engage inmisconduct. Our adversarial system was designed to protect people against abuses by having advocates on both sides to ensure that rights are protected. As thelate Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stephenswrote, \"disposing of lawyers is a step in the direction of a totalitarian form of government.\"Others have pointed out that several attorneys who have previously represented Trump found themselves in legal hot water, such asSidney Powell,Rudy Giuliani,Jenna EllisandJohn Eastman. However, this also misses the mark, as there is a major difference between attorneys participating in campaign activities - which is what put those lawyers in jeopardy - and criminal attorneys defending a client in court. Successful criminal attorneys represent all sorts of interesting and sometimes unsavory characters without being tempted to engage in any unethical or illegal behavior. In my own experience representing Trump in the January 6 and Mar-a-Lago investigations, I never felt any pressure to compromise my integrity.Our founders understood the principle that these critics of Trump's defenders fail to grasp.John Adams, an ardent patriot who would help draft the Declaration of Independence and serve as the first US vice president and second president, agreed to take on the deeply unpopular representation of the British soldiers accused of murder in the Boston Massacre.In doing so, hestated, \"Council ought to be the very last thing that an accused Person should want [i.e. lack] in a free Country.\" The legal profession, he continued, \"ought in my opinion to be independent and impartial at all Times And in every circumstance,\" while the \"Persons whose Lives were at Stake ought to have the Council they preferred.\" He referred to the Boston Massacre as \"important a Cause as ever was tryed in any Court or Country of the World\" and therefore every lawyer must hold themselves to the highest legal principles and expect from him \"no Art nor Address, No Sophistry or Prevarication in such a Cause; nor anything more than Fact, Evidence and Law would justify.\"Our criminal justice system desperately needs less partisan influence, not more. Despite my public moniker of \"former Trump lawyer,\" I do not personally subscribe to the orthodoxy of either political party and I enjoy representing clients on both sides of the political aisle. Moreover, I do not believe that any honest lawyer should publicly identify themselves as either a \"conservative lawyer\" or a \"liberal lawyer.\" You can be a lawyer who holds conservative or liberal political beliefs, but those political beliefs should not alter how you represent our clients or impact our analysis of the facts or the law.Opinion by Timothy C.
