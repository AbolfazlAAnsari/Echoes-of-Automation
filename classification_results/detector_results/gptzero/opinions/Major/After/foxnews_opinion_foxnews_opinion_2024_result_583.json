We’re not sure but our FBI regularly sounds alarms about Chinese government-sponsored espionage. In fact, theFBI opens a new investigationon Chinese-government sponsored espionage every 12 hours.'FEARMONGERING': CHINESE MIGRANT SURGE HEARING DISMISSED BY HOUSE DEMS DESPITE NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNSOf course, a cross-section of the world has illegally entered America thanks to Biden. Although the number of Chinese illegals is increasing, there are other suspicious aliens from anti-American places, such as the Mideast, that should remind us that it took just 19 Saudi terrorists to shutter America on Sept. 11, 2001.Consider the case of two Mideastern men who tried to force their way onto a Marine Corps base.On May 3, 2024, two men drove a truck up to theQuantico Marine Corpsbase’s main gate and told the guards they were making an Amazon delivery to the base’s post office. They showed no access credentials, and their vehicle had no affiliation with the base. They ignored the guard’s direction to pull over for further inspection. Rather, they kept driving onto the base until a vehicle denial barrier blocked them, according to a Marine Corps spokesman.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONOne of the men was identified as a Jordanian foreign national who recently crossed our southern border, and the other, according to a press report, was identified as being on the U.S. terrorist watch list. The details about this case remain veiled by the Biden administration.Unfortunately, these incidents are just the tip of the iceberg.  Recently, there have been other efforts to gain access to sensitive military installations. The scope of the problem is no doubt classified and besides, Biden’s people don’t want to associate theirfailed open border policywith the growing threat to the homeland.What might these incidents mean? They could mean that among the millions of illegals allowed into this country by Biden’s open-border policy, some have truly nefarious aims.In fact, some could be here to size up our security and infrastructure, and perhaps others are staging as sleeper cells ready for a future terrorist attack like 9/11 or something far worse, like insurgents armed and poised to attack critical infrastructure such as power plants, bridges and military bases in preparation for a broader war.Those of us who have worn our nation’s military uniform and seen first-hand the actions of spies overseas, understand well whatBiden’s open-border policymeans: an invitation to our enemies to size up America in order to eventually kill, maim and perhaps defeat this country and that might start by compromising key military installations.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ROBERT MAGINNISRobert Maginnis is a retired U.S. Army officer and the author of 11 books, including the soon-to-be released \"Out of this World: Are UFOs Aliens, Spirits, or Pure Hokum?\"Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
