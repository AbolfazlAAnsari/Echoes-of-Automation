But while the shuffle might create a temporary distraction from negative economic news, absent real policy reform no superficial moves will reverse Canada's full-blown economic growth crisis.Consider that Canada is one of the only high-income countries yet to rebound economically from the COVID recession(https://financialpost.com/tag/recession/). Adjusted for inflation(https://financialpost.com/tag/inflation/), average income per person was $55,677 in the first three months of this year compared with $56,183 at the end of 2019. We're poorer today than we were 40 months ago despite the avalanche of federal government spending and borrowing.Unfortunately, our troubles started well before COVID. In fact, Canada's economy was weaker heading into the COVID recession than it was heading into the past four recessions or slowdowns. From 2016 to 2019, the pre-COVID era overseen by Trudeau, per person GDP(https://financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-gdp-beats-forecasts-economists) grew by less than one per cent a year on average after adjusting for inflation (0.9 per cent to be exact) compared to fully 3.7 per cent from 1997 to 2000 under Jean Chrétien. Growth was more than four times higher under Chrétien than Trudeau.As if that weren't bad enough, consider Canada's performance compared to our southern neighbours. In 2016, average per person incomes in Canada were 82 per cent of U.S. levels - $54,154 compared with $65,792, or an $11,600 difference per person (with all dollar figures in C$). By the end of 2022, our per person incomes had fallen to 76 per cent of U.S. levels - $55,863 compared to $73,565. Put differently, Canadians are $17,700 per person poorer than Americans.Canada's average income per person is now lower than income levels in 41 U.S. states. Our average per person income of $55,863 ranks us just below Louisiana ($57,954) and Maine ($57,271) and just ahead of New Mexico ($54,874) and Kentucky ($54,671) - which is probably not where Canadians would like to be.Going forward, things are likely to get a lot worse.

We are also last in the OECD's prediction for growth from 2030 to 2060. Long-term forecasts can change, of course, but these should be setting off alarm bells in Ottawa.And yet, despite all the evidence and dire warnings, the Trudeau government and its most important ministers seem oblivious to the facts. Earlier this month, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland had this to say(https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2023/07/remarks-by-the-deputy-prime-minister-and-minister-of-finance-on-critical-minerals-and-creating-good-paying-careers-in-saskatchewan.html): \"I think we can be really optimistic about the Canadian economy. Canada had the strongest economic growth in the G7 over the course of 2022.\"Canada's anti-business culture undermines growth(https://financialpost.com/opinion/canada-anti-business-culture-undermines-growth)We are in the grip of climate-change catastrophism(https://financialpost.com/opinion/grip-climate-change-catastrophism)TV sports are global. Why not the Wide World of Trade?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/grip-climate-change-catastrophism)Yes, Minister Freeland, our economy did grow by 2.1 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022, beating the other six G7 countries. But our population grew by 2.7 per cent. That means we got poorer per person, not richer.There's something very wrong with the government's strategy for economic growth. It likes to claim the high ground of evidence-based policy-making. But if you do look at the evidence, the economic data speak for themselves. A country where living standards have grown impressively through most of its history now seems adrift. Absent major policy change, shuffling a few cabinet positions won't make a dent in Canada's bleak economic prospects.Niels Veldhuis and Milagros Palacios are economists with the Fraser Institute. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
