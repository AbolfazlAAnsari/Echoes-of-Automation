Unless the RNC bans horserace-style elections altogether, those who wish to contain the Trump campaign need to persuade their partisan allies in each state that the best way to win a national election is to design rules which can unify the party around a candidate that can win broad public support.Horserace rules are best reserved for general elections when they typically generate two and only two major parties, each with a broad political base. By contrast, proportional representation better fits a party's purpose in the presidential primary selection process.Here, the goal is to facilitate fair representation for all points of view at the nominating convention. Let all candidates run and get whatever share of the vote they can. Coalition formation can take place at, or on the eve, of the national convention.Democrats have figured this out. Proportional representation in primary electionsis now mandatedby the Democratic National Committee (DNC). These national rules have placed limits on the strength of the party's progressive left as well as on a potential Dixiecrat faction or the emergence of any other extremist group.In 2020, proportional representation ensured that the centrist candidate, Joe Biden, would receive strong support in nearly every state so long as he maintained a strong base in the African American community and among moderates. Neither Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts nor Bernie Sanders of Vermont, both progressives, could gain enough traction in enough states to beat him. A similar dynamic will likely be in play in 2024 if a progressive candidate attempts to challenge Biden next year.As mentioned, Republican rules in 2016 penalized states if they held horserace elections too early, by cutting the number of delegates representing the state at the convention. As a result, neither Trump nor any other candidate gained a decisive advantage in the primaries held prior to Super Tuesday. But on and after that date, a close contest turned into a routwhen Trump wonwinner-take-all Florida, Arizona, Delaware, Maryland and Indiana -- as well as the lion's share of delegates in winner-take-most New York, Illinois and Connecticut.If election rules in 2024 remain the same as in 2016, a repeat scenario is more likely than not. It is true that the former president has alienated the Republican establishment by denouncing fellow Republicans, denying the results of the 2020 election, andsupporting weak, extremist candidatesin congressional primaries that cost the party control of the Senate.Yet Trump is stillgetting 38% supportin polling of Republican-aligned voters. If Trump can parley that base into horserace wins on Super Tuesday 2024 and thereafter, piling up delegate strength well above actual levels of popular support, Republicans will be little different than Democrats when they followed William Jennings Bryan and his \"Cross of Gold\" todefeat on three successive occasionsat the beginning of the 20th century.Again, if rules require proportional representation, no candidate will be able to enter the convention with a clear majority unless they have captured a majority of the Republican primary voters. Further, extremist candidates will find it difficult to expand beyond their base. As a result, the candidate entering the convention with the best chance of winning the presidency, should be best positioned to win the party nomination.Democrats remain committed to proportional representation. It is time for Republicans to wake up and do the same.Opinion by Paul E. PetersonTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
