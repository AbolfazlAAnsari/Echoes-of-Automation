Trump, having survived two impeachments due to intense loyalty from Republicans on Capitol Hill, has reason to believe that he could withstand these charges and whatever outcome unfolds.In what was perhaps the most telling moment in the first Republican primary debate on Wednesday night, the majority of the candidates raised their hands when they were asked whether they would support Trump should he win the nomination and be criminally convicted.Vivek Ramaswamy raised his hand more quickly than Tracy Flick in the 1999 film \"Election.\" Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott, and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum all followed, although they appeared to do so more grudgingly. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis came off like a politician who shifts whichever way the winds are blowing by looking to the candidates on either side of him before raising his hand.Even Pence raised his hand. Given everything he has said about choosing the Constitution over Trump and depicting himself as someone who stood on the right side of history, Pence showed it's entirely possible for Trump to coalesce support even among his critics and primary opponents.Among voters, Trump still retains a hefty lead in the 2024 Republican primary polls. And many Democrats might be numb from the onslaught of accusations, indictments and scandals.Basically, Trump might be right to think he still has a chance at becoming president. Some of the reason that shock is increasingly fleeting in our public culture goes far beyond him. Continuallyrising distrust in governmentsince the 1960s has diminished expectations about our leaders. The rapid media cycle has the capacity to move from one issue to the next within hours, weakening the ability to keep national conversations focused on one topic. And in an intensely polarized world, issues and scandals don't move people as much when there are partisan considerations at play.Although other politicians have deployed similar strategies, with Nixon reportedly calling the Watergate hearings a \"witch hunt\", nobody has launched the same level of assault on decency as Trump. In many cases, he has owned the controversial statements he made, been open about flouting the rules and doubled down when criticized for his egregious behavior. Often, he simply turns the tables by questioning the legitimacy of his accusers, discrediting those who dare question his comments and behavior, warning that any attacks on him are really attacks on his supporters.As a result, when many Americans see a mug shot like this, the photograph barely causes a stir.Regardless of where one stands, the former president of the United States turning himself in for charges stemming from the effort to reverse the democratic will of the American people should sink in as a historic moment in the United States.The legal system is now at work, holding Trump to account in many cases where the political world failed to take meaningful action. However, without a serious shift in public opinion, Trump might just learn that it is possible to do almost anything and still retain immense influence in politics.Opinion by Julian Zelizer, CNNTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
