We don't know yet what the Netanyahu government was told, if anything, about a possible attack from Gaza, but given the large-scale nature of the attacks, it seems conceivable that there were some indications that an attack was coming.Israelis will likely only find out if there is a real demand for timely accountability and if the Netanyahu government agrees to provide it.For now, understandably, the Israelis are focused on the ongoing conflict. \"We were surprised this morning,\" Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, the international spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces, told CNN Saturday. \"About failures, I prefer not to talk at this point right now. We're in war. We're fighting. I'm sure this will be a big question once this event is over.\"\"I assume the intelligence question will be talked about down the road and we'll learn what happened there.\"In so many \"surprise\" attacks, from Pearl Harbor to the Yom Kippur War to 9/11, it turns out that relevant intelligence generated by spy agencies was disseminated to policymakers, but it wasn't heeded as it didn't fit with the assumptions they had about the actual nature and scale of the threat.Opinion by Peter Bergen, CNNTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
