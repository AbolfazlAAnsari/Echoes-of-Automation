Under Trump’s leadership, women saw economic success of unprecedented levels – unemployment for women reached record lows, women’s median income increased, and the workforce participation gap between men and women shrank to the narrowest on record at the time.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONBut women are also less safein Kamala Harris' America. Most of us know the pain that comes from losing a loved one, but no one should have to experience losing their family member to a violent criminal who entered our country illegally.Tragically, Harris’ wide-open border has taken the lives of many innocent women like Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student, who was brutally murdered on a run at the University of Georgia and an illegal immigrant was charged with the crime. An illegal immigrant from El Salvador was charged for raping and killing Rachel Morin, a Maryland mother to five children.From diapers to daycare, dangerously liberal Kamala Harris, who was the deciding vote on the so-called ‘Inflation Reduction Act’ that worsened inflation, has skyrocketed costs for women who are trying to start a family. Since 2019, the average price for a pack of disposable diapers has increased 32%, and almost half of hardworking families are struggling to afford them.In June, Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old girl from Houston, Texas was found strangled to death and two illegal immigrants from Venezuela were charged with her murder. Similarly, a Texas grandmother, Patricia Portillo, was shot and killed at a Chick-fil-A and an illegal immigrant was also charged with that crime. These daughters, sisters, mothers and grandmothers are now missing from the lives of their families.Violent migrant crime from Harris' open borders is not the only danger women have to worry about – over 31 tons of fentanyl has crossed our southern border since Harris was sworn in as vice president and is now the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 45.At the RNC in Milwaukee, Anne Funder shared the devastating story of losing her 15-year-old son to a pill that was laced with fentanyl in 2022. Moms across the country like her deserve a president who will end the fentanyl crisis that has plagued our cities and suburbs and protect our kids. Kamala Harris cannot say she puts women first, when her policies put criminals above American citizens.Don’t take it from me, take it from the countless women who are struggling to feed and clothe their families, and even to keep them safe in their own homes – Democrats have broken their promises to women for years, and enough is enough. It's time for women to break up with the Democrat Party and vote for a president that means it when he says, \"Promises made, promises kept.\"CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LARA TRUMPLara Trump is co-chair of the Republican National Committee and a former senior adviser to Donald J.
