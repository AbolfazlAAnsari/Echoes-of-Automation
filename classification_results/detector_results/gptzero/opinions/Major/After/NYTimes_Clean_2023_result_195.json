Ms. Spiers, nobody thinks that “Black children are automatically better off with nice white parents than their own biological parents.”Is it right that my adopted Black child has us, who are white and wealthy, as parents? No. But it wasn’t right either for him to grow up in his birth parents’ house.Fostering and adopting happen when the right thing is not possible. It’s a world of second-best solutions. Rather than demonizing us foster/adoptive parents, I wish Ms. Spiers would come up with some helpful solutions.Betsy TomicOssining, N.Y.To the Editor:As a white parent of four children, two of whom are people of color, I take exception to the generalization that I chose to adopt out of a sense of providing a more enlightened home than would be provided by parents of the same race as the children.My wife and I are the fortunate ones, to be provided the opportunity to experience all the joys and challenges of parenthood. We reject a “do-gooder” assumption, or that our skin color makes us better qualified to parent.Michael FitzgeraldBen Lomond, Calif.Mitch McConnell’s HealthTo the Editor:Re “Senator Shares Doctor’s Letter Saying He’s ‘Medically Clear’ to Work” (news article, Sept. 1):Our political leaders are aging, and lapses in some of their cognitive capacities are becoming noteworthy news events that call into question their capacities to govern. Mitch McConnell joins a list that includes, among others, Dianne Feinstein, John Fetterman and even President Biden.When Brian Monahan, the attending physician of Congress, stated, “I have informed Leader McConnell that he is medically clear to continue with his schedule as planned,” he means that Mr. McConnell’s health is not immediately being endangered by his continuing to work.He does not say that Mr. McConnell’s ability to govern responsibly, which is the concern of all of us whose lives are affected by his leadership actions, is not impaired. In order to determine that, one would need the results of neuropsychological testing.Michael RobbinsAmherst, Mass.The writer is former professor of clinical psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.The Education Department’s SuccessesTo the Editor:Re “Republicans Scale Back ‘Anti-Woke’ Messaging on Education Issues” (news article, Aug. 29):Presidential candidates are renewing the call to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education, established in 1979. If the department is so harmful, we would expect evidence of a stagnation or decline in test scores and high school graduation rates over the last 40 years, but this has not been the case.Educational outcomes for racial and ethnic minorities who are a major focus of Education Department equity policies have improved substantially and at a much greater rate than for white students.Black and Hispanic students’ reading scores at age 9 and math scores at age 13 between the mid-1970s and 2020 (largely pre-Covid) rose by about two and a half to three grades on the federal long-term National Assessment.High school completion rates for 18-to-24-year-olds increased 20 percentage points for Black students and 30 percentage points for Hispanic students.Of course, the scores for Black and Hispanic students are lagging and need improvement, but these large gains in outcome don’t support eliminating the Education Department.Alan GinsburgChevy Chase, Md.The writer is the former director of Policy and Program Studies at the Education Department.What You Can Do to Help Combat Climate ChangeTo the Editor:Re “We Cannot Escape What We’ve Done to the Planet,” by Serge Schmemann (Opinion, Aug. 25):For those individuals concerned about climate change who feel that they don’t know how to make a difference, here are some suggestions.Consume less. Fly less. Drive less and/or make your next car electric. Compost your food waste. Buy local. Eat less meat. Convert your lawn to a landscape of native plants and trees. Conserve energy and/or transition to renewable sources.Advocate for the end to fossil fuel subsidies and new oil and gas infrastructure (one way is to join theMarch to End Fossil Fuelsin New York City on Sept. 17).None of us will do all the things mentioned, but choosing a few can absolutely help to combat the climate crisis.Mary K. StevensGuilford, Conn.Making Bathrooms CoedTo the Editor:Re “Florida Approves Penalties for Violating Bathroom Law” (news article, Aug. 24):There is a solution to this hostile and provocative law. Lots of colleges have coed bathrooms.When I was a student at Wesleyan University, I lived in a coed dorm with coed bathrooms and showers, and it was not a problem. Each toilet stall and shower was separate, and each shower had a small changing vestibule. This is a common setup for communal bathrooms and it provides plenty of privacy.Sarah FlandersPittsburghThis article appeared in print on page A23."
