But her mere presence in the race is deemed intolerable and his most fervent supporters discern the handiwork of a shadowy cabal.Vivek Ramaswamy, who'd be willing to say that his own mother was in on the faking of the moon landing if he thought it'd win him more MAGA credibility, professes to understand the conspiracy. \"I think that if she stays in this race, it will continue to reveal that there are some sinister forces at work here,\" he told Fox News Digital.\"There's no path for her to defeat Donald Trump through the front door,\" Ramaswamy explained, \"which means what they're actually rooting for is eliminating him from competition and then it becomes no mystery that the very people propping up Nikki Haley are the very people who are also paying for the lawsuits to keep Donald J. Trump off the ballot and the lawsuits against him.\"Q.E.D.All this energy is being devoted, not to attacking Biden, but the second-place finisher in New Hampshire who doesn't have an obvious path to winning a major state. If there's nothing wrong with her winning independents, Haley does need to be much stronger among Republicans to have any future in the race. Despite the brave talk now, she may end up dropping out ahead of South Carolina.All the indications are that Haley isn't creating strong loyalists in her element of the primary vote that will follow her wherever she goes. But she is appealing to the Republicans and Republican-leaning independents that Trump needs to substantially bring home in November to beat Biden. Killing her with kindness would make much more sense for Trump than, in irate speeches and unhinged social media posts, reminding her voters why they don't like him in the first place.The fault here isn't with Haley, but with Trump himself."
