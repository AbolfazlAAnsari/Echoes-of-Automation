A surge of pro-life activism could offer a competing ballot measure that proffered, say, a 10-week abortion ban, when polling suggests there is moreopenness to restrictionsthan earlier in pregnancy, coupled with explicit, crystal-clear carveouts for cases of rape, incest or threats to the life of the mother.This would, of course, be a step back from thesix-week bansigned into law by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year. And it may not be the purest version of abortion legislation pro-life forces would like to see. But an imperfect win is better than uncompromising losses. And, given the track record of abortion rights campaigns in even states governed by Republicans, pro-life forces will have to try something new to avoid the same fate.Their media strategy may need to change as well. As Semafor's Dave Weigel haspointed out, abortion opponents have adopted a somewhat scattershot approach to their media strategy, running ads warning of\"trans ideology\" anddrag queensin their quest to defeat reproductive rights amendments. That approach has not borne fruit. A more narrowly tailored strategy that allows pro-life leaders to focus on the more controversial abortion cases, like abortions around the point of fetal viability, could give the movement the rhetorical upper ground.Somenational organizationsthat oppose abortion have focused their attention on trying to get presidential candidates to take a position on a federal ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Such a bill, of course, is politically implausible in the near- to medium-term - it would only be passable if Republicans had a friendly president in the White House, a GOP-controlled House and a filibuster-proof 60-vote majority in the Senate.Yet, while national organizationshave pressedGOP presidential candidates toespouse a federal ban, a popular groundswell behind a federal 15-week ban is a long way off. Anew poll, conducted for CNN by SSRS, found that even among voters who approve of the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, two-thirds of respondents think politicians should leave decisions on abortion restrictions up to the states. Putting this push to bed, at least until the political winds change, may help focus attention on the need for bothsubstantive policy shiftsandrhetorical changesthat could win over persuadable voters who aren't firmly committed to either side of the question.There is plenty in the sweeping Ohio amendment that pro-life forces could target. As a staff editorial in the conservative magazineNational Reviewpointed out, the amendment doesn't explicitly say it will require state funds to be used to provide abortions, or wipe Ohio's laws requiring parental consent for minors to obtain an abortion, off the books. But its sweeping language, eliminating laws that would \"indirectly burden, penalize,...interfere with, or discriminate against\" the right of an individual (of any age) to seek out an abortion makes those outcomes quite possible.Focusing on those specific areas of disagreement, rather than wide-ranging ads about drag queens, might make the vote in Ohio this November a little tighter than some observers expect. But like a football team that has found a weak point in the opposing defense, the abortion rights movement will continue to run its successful playbook.And unless those of us who consider ourselves pro-life make the requisite adjustments, we may be faced with the unwelcome sight of reproductive rights ballot amendments winning again and again.Opinion by Patrick T.
