The job responsibilities included constant work on their feet (even overnight) and excellent negotiation and interpersonal skills.The company was seeking someone with degrees in medicine, finance and the culinary arts. The shocked interviewees soon lost interest in the role when they were told there would be no compensation for the job, no breaks and no vacation days. Thework was 24/7, 365 daysa year. In fact, on holidays the employee’s workload would increase and it was required to be done in a cheerful disposition.People may think \"moms don’t have a real job.\" Nothing could be further from the truth.(iStock)It turned out that the job posting was fake.The job description was that of being a Mom.DR. NICOLE SAPHIER'S ‘LOVE, MOM’ CELEBRATES MOTHERHOOD IN LATEST TITLE FROM FOX NEWS BOOKSThe interviewees quickly agreed that being a mom is the most challenging yet rewarding job in the world. This message is needed now more than ever in a world that so often takes mothers for granted.People may think \"moms don’t have a real job\" or assume that their work requires no special talent or skills. Nothing could be further from the truth.Mothers across the world and for all time have worked tirelessly to ensure that her child feels loved and taken care of, and that her child will live a life better than she did.This Mother’s Day, I want to highlight thestrength of three motherswho have inspired me during my time in the pro-life movement.Mothers work tirelessly to ensure that their children feel loved and taken care of.(iStock)Rose was diagnosed with endometriosis and told she could never have kids. As she was grieving this news with her husband, a young woman nearby named Elizabeth was grieving for a different reason. Elizabeth just found out she was pregnant, but she was unmarried and terrified to raise a child on her own.MOTHER'S DAY: THE BEST ONE-LINERS AND LIFE ADVICE I'VE EVER GOTTEN FROM MOMBy the grace of God, the two women met and formed a deep, trust-filled relationship. Soon, Elizabeth would entrust Rose and her husband with adopting her baby. Their daughter, Maria Elizabeth grew up in a loving household, even having a strong relationship with her birth mom.Later, Rose and her husbandadopted another little onenamed Joe. Maria is now a 24-year-old, ninth-grade algebra teacher in Georgia, and 19-year-old Joe is working as a plumbing apprentice and personal trainer.Rose and Elizabeth chose motherhood in different but equally beautiful ways, and their lives show how the choice for adoption rather than abortion can produce more joy and love than anyone ever imagined.A mother’s job never stops, and far too often their work goes unnoticed.(iStock)When Beverly was 18 weeks pregnant with her and her husband’s ninth child, she got a call that turned their lives upside down. Their child wasdiagnosed with \"Trisomy 18,\"a life-limiting prenatal diagnosis.She was told by her doctor that her baby would be a \"drain on [her] family\" if she lived at all. Still, she decided to love her baby girl, no matter what conditions she may have. Her beautiful daughter, Verity, is now 7 years old and her family’s \"most precious blessing.\"MOTHER'S DAY PAMPERING FOR BELOVED MOMS: HERE ARE 5 LUXURIOUS SPA GIFTS THAT COST LESS THAN THEY LOOKBeverly recently said, \"True love puts others first. It requires self-sacrifice, not self-interest. True love invites us to serve others, especially the most marginalized and helpless in society.

She wasaddicted to drugsand had been abused in her marriage. After losing custody of her four children, she despaired and spent the next 17 months of her life stealing cars and drugs for a living.One day after being robbed at gunpoint, she decided to quit this hopeless lifestyle. She turned herself into the local jail where she served 10 months.Soon after being released from jail, Francesca sat awaiting her psychiatric drug prescription. She was shocked when the doctor instead sent her home with prenatal vitamins. The child’s father was her former drug dealer.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONFrancesca turned in desperation to a local maternity home where she found love, support and hope.
