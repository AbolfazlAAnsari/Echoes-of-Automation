Today, just 12 million American workers are covered by defined benefit plans, leaving workers with 401(k)s vulnerable to declines in stock market values. In 2022, workers with 401(k)s saw their retirement assets plummet about 20% from the year prior, according toFidelity. At the same time, corporate boards like Walmart's are approving executive benefits that have grown exponentially in comparison to worker pay - in fact, the Economic Policy Institute released a report stating thatCEO pay has increased by 1,460% since 1978, while worker pay has increased by just 18.1%.Another part of the problem comes from federal tax law. Ordinary employees face strict limits on the amount of income they can set aside tax-free into their retirement plans: $22,500 for most workers and $30,000 for workers over 50 (indeed, just 14% ofVanguard'snearly five million 401(k) customers max out).In contrast, CEO-deferred compensation plans have no limits to the amount of income that can be shielded from tax and grow tax-free until the funds are withdrawn. These special provisions save corporate executives millions of dollars in taxes, while denying federal and state treasuries funds they would otherwise be entitled to.Congress has the power to narrow this retirement gap. First, it could close loopholes that favor corporate executives with lucrative retirement tax subsidies and instead treat all workers the same, regardless of the kind of work they do. That means all workers, regardless of the job they perform, should be subject to the same rules governing their tax-free retirement deferrals.Second, lawmakers could raise the cap on income subject toSocial Security payroll taxes, which is currently at $160,200. Currently, an executive earning $1 million a year finishes paying their payroll taxes in February - as every dollar over $160,200 is exempt from Social Security tax. Removing that cap would generate revenue to expand Social Security so that vulnerable workers with no other source of retirement income could receive additional monthly benefits.Retirement inequality is a manifestation of corporate priorities to increase shareholder profits at the expense of worker retirement security, and federal policies that don't do enough to balance interests and protect workers. Corporate profits should not trump peoples' ability to retire comfortably. Together, we can begin to close these gaps and ensure all workers the dignified retirement to which they are entitled.Opinion by Scott KlingerTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
