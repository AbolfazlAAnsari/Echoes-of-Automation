The Biden administration issued anexecutive orderin February to address cybersecurity in our ports to address the increasing reliance on a connected system of digital control on ships and in ports.FromChinese-manufactured cargo cranestoAI controlled operating systems, threat vectors for cyber actors have multiplied exponentially. Beyond cyberattacks, risks spring from new fuels, massively sized ships and lack of transparency into private financing for port infrastructure.Our MTSremains vulnerablenot only to attacks at the tactical level, but also to systemic erosion of control by foreign interests. Understanding the ownership and control of our infrastructure such as ports, terminals, cranes and computer systems demands our attention in order to address the threat of hostile foreign involvement.Analysis by Rear Admiral James Watson and his co-authors in their new book \"ZERO POINT FOUR\" details just how our capacity and capability in waterways and shipping is not sufficient to meet future challenges. Following World War II, more than half the merchant vessels plying the world's oceans were US flagged. Today a mere 0.4% of global trade is carried by US flagged vessels. We are and always have been a maritime nation, dependent on waterways for our way of life. Our Navy is second to none.Fortunately, in our own internal waters and exclusive economic zone, we are served by a world class offshore fleet in the Gulf of Mexico, ensuring our energy interests on the outer continental shelf are maintained.Similarly, the25,000 miles of navigable inland waterwaysthat are crucial to export grains that feed the world are served by a robust and modern fleet of tow vessels and barges. But to truly serve our national security interests, we must have a commercial oceangoing capability that serves under our own flag.While US shipping and shipbuilding have diminished over the decades, Chinahas surgedto become the number one shipbuilding nation in the world. Additionally, China is thelargest owner of cargo ship tonnagein the world.Now is the time to put policies into place that incentivize US carriers that support the growth of US shipyards and that grow the pool of Americans entering our merchant marine. The US maritime industry is up to the task of meeting these challenges. A collaborative approach between government and the private sector has the potential to leverage a vast array of innovative technologies and approaches to achieve a safe and secure MTS.The loss of life from this crisis and the cascading impacts to ports across our nation demand more than a brief time in the headlines.Opinion by Richard TimmeTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
