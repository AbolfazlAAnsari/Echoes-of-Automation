In recent weeks, he has been meeting with relatives of those held hostage in Gaza, as well as survivors of Oct. 7 and family members of those killed. “Tragedy is part of Israeli life, and I knew it would be part of my time as president. But none of us imagined a tragedy like this,” he writes.Mr. Herzog’s core idea is about the “moral confusion” he sees in the aftermath of Oct. 7. He sees a struggle not just between Israel and Hamas but between people who see terrorist acts in conflict with humanity and people who try to justify terrorist acts. His argument about moral confusion centers on people in the Middle East, in America and elsewhere who rationalize or even support the Hamas attack on Israel. “It would have been unthinkable to hear such moral confusion uttered after the Sept. 11 attacks or after bombings in London, Barcelona and Baghdad,” he writes.Some readers will surely agree with Mr. Herzog’s essay, and some will no doubt disagree.
