In recent weeks, Robert Kennedy Jr., the 69-year-old son of the distinguished senator from New York who was tragically assassinated in 1968, announced he is running in the 2024 Democratic presidential primary. Although experts didn't pay much attention to his candidacy initially, there has been more chatter in recent weeks.Kennedy, an environmental lawyer turned anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, is polling between10 and 20%nationally. And he keeps gaining significant media attention, from a lengthy profile inNew York Magazineto his appearance onJoe Rogan's popular podcast.There are many reasons Kennedy might cause trouble for Biden. His left-leaning positions on the environment and corporations, coupled with conspiracy theories, many of which are popular on the right, could cause some voters to peel away from Biden.And, of course, there is the Kennedy name - one of the most recognizable and beloved in Democratic politics.The biggest problem, however, has to do with the primary calendar. At the end of last year, Biden switched the Democratic primary schedule to put South Carolina first. But New Hampshire is refusing to cede its historic spot, pointing to a state law that stipulates the Granite State must hold its primary one week before all the others.As a result, Bidenmight not even appearon the New Hampshire ballot, effectively ceding the state to Kennedy and author and speaker Marianne Williamson.If Kennedy sails to victory, this could cause a fallout reminiscent to what President Lyndon B.

There is no evidence that he has the capacity to pull off what President Ronald Reagan came close to achievingin 1976- knocking off incumbent President Gerald Ford for the Republican nomination.Like other primary challenges against incumbent presidents, the main threat Kennedy poses is the negative impact he might have on Biden and the possibility thathis candidacy could weaken the standing of a president who has already struggled with low approval ratings and concerns about his age.Unlike Republican attacks, Kennedy's criticism will come from within the Democratic fold and could gain more legitimacy within the party (although he has also gotten support from the right, from people who may be looking for a way to disrupt Biden). And while he has shied away from direct attacks on Biden thus far, that could change as the campaign progresses.We have seen the damage that this can cause. Like the tremors that McCarthy caused when he nearly upset Johnson, Sen. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee had a similar impact on a struggling President Harry Truman in 1952. After Kefauver was victorious in New Hampshire, Trumansoon announcedthat he would not run for reelection.In 1980, Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts mounted a formidable challenge to President Jimmy Carter. Ted Kennedy blasted him, saying that he wasa weak leaderand criticized him for abandoning core Democratic constituencies and ideas.Although Carter won the nomination, he left the competitionbloodied and bruised, with more questions about how effective he would be. The fallout certainly harmed him as hefaced Reagan and lost.In 1992, the former speechwriter and television pundit Patrick Buchanan took on Republican President George H.W. Bush. Despite Buchanan's controversial reputation and history of spouting bigoted views, Buchananexcited many conservativeswith his populist, anti-establishment appeal.Some of his attacks on \"King George\" - which painted Bush as a president who was out of touch with the concerns of working Americans - stuck.
