Comey explained that he wasn't very concerned about the agency in the long term, though, predicting that at some point the \"fever\" would certainly break.His comments reflect a common misconception, namely that former President Donald Trump's ongoing support within the GOP is some sort of aberration that revolves around the person rather than the party. Instead of talking about the electoral coalition that propelled Trump into power, and which currently makes him the leading Republicannominee for reelection, the conversation continues to revolve around the former president himself. This perspective has informedmuch of the coverageof the Republican primaries - with ongoing discussions about whether one of the nominees will be able to bring Trumpism to an end by knocking out the top nominee.To understand Trumpism, it is important to look at who comprises the GOP base. As Ronald Brownstein has so well documented forCNN, Trump's popularity is rooted in the rural White base of the Republican Party. And in a recentpiece for The Atlantic, Brownstein examined how the Republican majority in the House in 2023 generally represents districts with older, non-college educated, lower-income, White voters.The reason Trumpism has been so influential is that many of the ideas it espouses mesh well with the sentiment in this electorate. The kind of conservative anti-establishment populism that Trump has promoted, which isnationalistic,nativistic,distrustful, disruptive and deeply hostile to the social and cultural changes that have taken place since the 1960s, has strong appeal with many Republican voters.It is true that political parties can change dramatically.

They are not the result of one candidate winning or losing, nor are they some sort of short-term spell that parties go through and come out of. Changing a party requires building new kinds of electoral support with groups of people who have felt alienated or who were once part of the opposition.
