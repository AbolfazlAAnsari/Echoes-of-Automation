It's about restoring faith in our institutions and ensuring the safety of our leaders. President Biden has called for a fast-track investigation, and we must hold him to that. We need clear answers to fundamental questions: How did the shooter gain access to the roof? What protocols failed? What steps will be taken to prevent such an incident from ever happening again?Without a thorough investigation, public trust in the government will erode further, fostering conspiracy theories and deepening divisions. The American people deserve the truth, and it's up to House Republicans to deliver it. This is a pivotal moment. We must seize it to restore confidence in our democracy and ensure the safety of those who lead it. LAURA INGRAHAM"
