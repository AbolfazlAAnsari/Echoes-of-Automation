It’s something.That said, we have to wonder if the Ukrainian army would not be in a better position if it had been given what it has been demanding since the start of the invasion, in February last year. I think that Russian presidentVladimir Putinhas succeeded in scaring the West with his threats of nuclear war, hence its reluctance to put troops on the ground.But today, after almost two years of merciless war, theUkrainians are exhausted.  Allied countries must move up a gear and truly give the Ukrainian army the means to repel its rival.Russia must not win.Sylvio Le BlancMontrealThis has to be a jokePanto season appears to be in full swing atHolyrood.  Minister Mairi McAllan inaugurated it with an admirably comic statement imparted with a deadpan delivery: “More often than not, world leaders are approaching the Scottish government asking for our advice on how we have managed to lead the way so successfully on a number of fronts.”This has to be a joke.On which subjects, at which this regime has allegedly excelled, has advice been sought from them? Would it be Scotland’s financial management? The bringing into service of ferries? The conduct of a census? Or perhaps it would be oursuccess in school results, in maths, reading and science? Or the speedy treatment of patients atScotland’s A&E departments? Or in the prevention of drug deaths?Whatever, clearly someone with a highly developed sense of humour wrote McAllan’s script.Jill StephensonEdinburgh"
