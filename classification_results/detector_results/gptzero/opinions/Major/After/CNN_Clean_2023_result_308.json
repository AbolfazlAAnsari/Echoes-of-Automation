When Congress authorizes spending, common sense dictates that the debt must be honored without conditions.Yet, the House GOP is currently agreeing to honor America's financial obligations only if Biden agrees to their wish list of right-wing agenda items. These Republican demands range fromendingclean-energy incentives contained in the Inflation Reduction Act to reversing Biden'scancellationof student loan debt to massive cuts in domestic programs.Their demands are akin to buying a new refrigerator, taking it home and using it and then later telling the credit card company that you won't pay the bill unless they agree to new conditions.By invoking the 14th Amendment now-regardless of the ultimate court decision-President Biden would show bold leadership. He'd demonstrate that he's willing to protect American jobs and safeguard our economy, which currently boasts the lowestunemployment ratesince 1969 and the lowest Black unemployment rate ever.Let Republicans file a lawsuit seeking to drive the United States into a default to destroy that. I'm confident that, come 2024, it will only give voters another reason to reject the GOP.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
