Columbia should look atDartmouth’s presidentwho, after October 7, promoted civil discourse among students and faculty, instead of staying silent and encouraging violence. That school has rejected radicalism in favor of real learning.But hiring the right president is only the first step of many. Columbia must bring in new professors who are intellectually diverse and bring students together in forums for discussion on tough issues. Ultimately, it must bring out the best of higher education, causing students and professors alike to challenge each other in pursuit of understanding and truth.Until that happens, Americans should still regard Columbia University with suspicion. Parents should think twice before sending their kids to a school that hasn’t clearly reformed itself. Donors should steer clear of giving money until they know their generosity will help more than it harms. I gave to Columbia for five straight decades. I won’t give them another penny until I see real change at every level.Minouche Shafik is gone, but Columbia still has a hell of a lot more work to do. Hopefully, my alma mater will actually do it, instead of just hiring another president who lets the rot continue. Students—and American society—deserve so much better.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM WILLIAM GRUVERWilliam R.
