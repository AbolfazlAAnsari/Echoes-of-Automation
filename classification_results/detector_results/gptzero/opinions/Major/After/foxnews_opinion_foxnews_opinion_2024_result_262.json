Talking about a \"court of law\" is the last thing this barbaric dictatorship can credibly discuss.However, last month, I filed a lawsuit against the regime in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., for their multiple attempts to assassinate and kidnap my family and me, as well as for three decades of imprisonment and torture at their hands. This lawsuit has substantial merit. In the United States, the rule of law holds significant value, unlike in the mullahs' regime in Iran, where it means nothing.Lastly, as advice tothe Biden administrationon how to handle this type of terror plot by Iran on U.S. soil, especially against Trump, they should follow President Clinton’s approach to a similar situation rather than attempt to engage diplomatically with the mullahs.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONPresident Bill Clinton speaks at a press conference at the White House on July 27, 1996. (Stringer/AFP via Getty Images)On June 26, 1993, Clinton sent 23 Tomahawk missiles to destroy the headquarters of the Iraqi Intelligence Service in response to their plan to assassinate former President George H.W. Bush a few weeks earlier. In his prime time televised address, Clinton called it a \"firm and commensurate\" response to the terrorist regime of Iraq.Having recently defeated Bush in the election,Clinton stated, \"There should be no mistake about the message we intend these actions to convey to Saddam Hussein, to the rest of the Iraqi leadership, and to any nation, group, or person who would harm our leaders or our citizens. We will combat terrorism. We will deter aggression. We will protect our people.\"What is Biden doing now? Releasing billions of dollars in funds to the ayatollahs and its IRGC, supplying questionable Secret Service for Trump, and not denouncing Democratic lawmakers who tried to strip the former president of protection via the sham \"Disgrace Act\" at the same time U.S. intelligence uncovered the assassination plot by the Iranian regime? This is WRONG.We are not calling for a war against the regime but for decisive leadership that cares for America. It is time to react as Clinton did and destroy the IRGC headquarters and thesupreme leader's palaceto send a strong message to all of America’s enemies.The people of Iran will do the rest to bring down the regime and make Iran a great friend and ally of the United States again.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM AMIR FAKHRAVARAmir Fakhravar is an award-winning writer, former political prisoner of IRGC inside Iran, and the Senate chairman of The National Iranian Congress.
