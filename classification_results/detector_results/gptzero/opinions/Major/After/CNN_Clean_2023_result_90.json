Marjorie Taylor Greene, George Santos, Lauren Boebert and others would be involved in drafting and voting on such a policy.Are these the type of people you trust to protect our nation's older citizens?(Pence insisted on Fox that \"we have to havea conversation about reforming entitlementsin the days ahead,\" and Republicans have been playing defense on Social Security and Medicare after Biden called some of them out in his recentState of the Union address.McCarthy has vowed to take cuts to Social Security and Medicare \"off the table\" innegotiations over the debt ceiling. And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell criticized GOP Sen. Rick Scott's original plan to sunset all federal programs after five years, including Social Security and Medicare, calling it \"just a bad idea.\"Scott recently added an exemptionfor Social Security and Medicare to his plan after much criticism.Trump has warned Republicansnot to make anycuts to Social Security and Medicare.)If Pence's idea of allowing people to invest their Social Security tax dollars in a private account sounds familiar, it should. In 2005, then-President George W. Bush proposed a similar idea, sayingin his State of the Union address: \"As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers. And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts.\"Bush sought to build supportfor this idea by traveling the nation. But he was confronted with a strong backlash from groups such asAARP that ran adsfeaturing a middle-aged couple saying, \"If we feel like gambling, we'll play the slots.\"Bush's approval ratings on Social Security soon began to plummet. In January 2005,a Washington Post/ABC pollfound that as Bush kicked off his campaign,55% of respondents disapprovedof his handling of Social Security. By that April, that number hadjumped to 64%.Bush's planto overhaul the program ultimatelyfailed to gain traction.In 1934, with an eye toward the Social Security legislation,Roosevelt notedthe stark world facing many older Americans then: \"Old age is at once the most certain, and for many people the most tragic of all hazards,\" he said. \"There is no tragedy in growing old, but there is tragedy in growing old without means of support.\" We can't go back to that reality.Beginning in 2035,Social Security will onlybe able to pay77% of benefitsunless there is somecongressional action. Having a good faith discussion on robustly funding the program - such as lifting thecap on earnings subject to Social Security taxfrom thecurrent rate of $160,200to all income - is needed.But recycling old, bad ideas such as the one Pence is peddling should be a non-starter - especially given the composition of the House GOP that would be involved in crafting such legislation. All Americans deserve the right to age with dignity and not have political games played with their golden years.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
