It’s so appropriate tohonor our momson this special day. We wouldn’t be here without them. And that may be an issue for the future.The Institute for Family Studies projects that 1 in 4 young women today will not be mothers.America’s fertility rateis falling.Young women are waiting so long to get married that they will be unable to have children and become childless. And some young women are purposely choosing to be child-free.Where would we be without our moms we celebrate today?(Cyberguy.com)There is nothing inherently wrong with not having children. For some, it is not a choice. And for a small minority, it is a choice to pursue a higher calling. But for most women, having children is essential for a flourishing society. Motherhood is a crucial life role.THE WORLD'S TOUGHEST, YET MOST REWARDING JOB: MOMS ARE HEROESWhere would we be without our moms we celebrate today? The difference they make in our lives is incalculable. Being a mom provides a woman with an unparalleled opportunity to impact lives. For many womenthere is no job or careershe can have that will make a difference like the one she makes as a mom.Healthy relationships equal success.

The love she has shown to our sons has been beautiful to witness. They could not have had a better mother. What my wife has done as a mom is the greatest accomplishment of her life.THE ONE FEAR PREVENTING SOME WOMEN FROM HAVING CHILDRENBut being a mom is hard work. There is no doubt about it. Itrequires a level of self-sacrificenot popular today. This may be part of the issue. Motherhood does not fit so well in a culture of self-care over service.For many women, there is no job or career she can have that will make a difference like the one she makes as a mom.(iStock)It’s true that being a mom means having limited time to pursue your own interests. Carrying the burden of having another human being dependent on you. And the stress of making decisions based on what is best for your child rather than yourself. Being a mom requires putting your own desires subordinate to your child.But what achievement of value comes without sacrifice. You don’t get a college degree without years of hard work. You don’t win a championship without incredible effort. You don’t own your own business without giving up security. Nothing worthwhile can be had without self-denial.And therewards of motherhoodare numerous. Though it certainly takes your husband’s contribution to make life, you bring life into this world.
