How seriously to take the risk of EMP events has been anactive policy debateforover 20 years.However, there isbipartisan consensusthat building resilience against man-made EMP events and naturally occurring geomagnetic ones is related, and there is a degree to which mitigation efforts are dual-use. This is helpful given thehybrid riskworld we live in. Dual-use mitigation efforts should remain a priority for resilience.Among the initiatives that should continue are those to improve the science of ground impacts of geomagnetic activity (includingpotentially permanent damage to pipelines) and efforts to convert the science into stronger infrastructure design - including within the electric grid and operational technology that powers communications and transportation efforts.Financial incentives should be put in place to invest inresilience-by-designto help protect communities against impacts from space weather. We can also learn from this solar storm and improve public risk communications with a wider swath of entities that run ourcritical infrastructure- including energy, communications and emergency services - who don't necessarily have continuity programs that are connected toNOAA's Space Weather Prediction Centeror the ability to rely on membership-driven formal information-sharing channels, such asInformation Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs).The government should also consider formally designatingspace infrastructure as a critical infrastructure sector, which would bring further attention to the resilience of satellite systems -both in space and terrestrially- and present an opportunity to strengthen public-private working relationships with major space service providers. Biden did not do so in NSM 22 but left the door open for that to change in the future as the president requested agency recommendations on crafting better infrastructure protection. The risks posed by space weather events are a compelling reason to make that designation.The dazzling aurora should remind us of the sun's power to potentially wreak havoc on critical systems we need. Our focus on building out resilience to natural and man-made space activity must continue.Opinion by Bob KolaskyTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
