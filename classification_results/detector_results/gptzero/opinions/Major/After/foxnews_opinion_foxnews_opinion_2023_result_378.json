We need God more than ever to intervene in ways only He can.Students participate in a chapel service at Asbury University in Wilmore, Kentucky, which has seen worshipers pouring in nationwide.(Asbury University)I’ve seen testimonies of people who have been amazed and mystified by things they’ve witnessed in the past week at Asbury–and while God will always do more than we could ever hope or imagine (Eph 3:20)--part of me longs for a day where the majority of Christians will see God’s direct actions in our world today and respond with less shock and more expectation for \"even greater things\" (John 14:12).In the hit series portraying Jesus’s ministry, \"The Chosen,\"the character of Jesus often says to His followers, \"Get used to different.\"As I continue to watch the events at Asbury unfold, this phrase comes to the forefront of my mind. Just as Jesus presented Himself very differently from the Messiah the Jews long expected, so too the Holy Spirit often surprises Christians in the way He manifests and works.A packed chapel at Asbury University in Wilmore, Kentucky, shows worshipers participating in what some are calling a spiritual revival.(Asbury University)His moves might not always feel \"comfortable,\" at least, from the outset, and He might touch people who we never imagined He would. But we must never try to put our infinite God in a box of our finite expectations.The key things we must remember are that where He is, there is freedom (2 Cor 3:17), and such freedom brings the fruits of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.It is important to be wise as serpents, testing the fruit of said \"moves of God\" so that we are never led astray by any demonic influence, but let us also remember Jesus’s warning that \"​​unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven\" (Matt 18:3).Students raise their hands during a service in the chapel at Asbury University, which has seen participants flocking in nationwide to witness its revival.(Asbury University )We must rememberGod’s callto come to Him in humility, seeking to know every aspect of His nature. And we must also have faith that God can, and does, want to use His Holy Spirit in powerful ways in each of our individual lives.In his book \"Hearing God,\" Christian writer Dallas Willard speaks on the nature of gatherings in the first-century church and how we can look to them as our example today.Noting 1 Corinthians 14, he writes, \"we see that they assumed that numerous people in the congregation were going to have some kind of communication from God which they would be sharing with others in the group….the ancient prophecy of Joel was fulfilled in the early church: \"Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams\" (Acts 2:17,Joel 2:28-32).Worshipers lift their hands during a service in the chapel of Asbury University in Wilmore, Kentucky.(Asbury University)The wish of Mosesthat \"all the Lord’s people were prophets, and that the Lord would put His spirit on them\" (Num 11:29) is substantially granted in the church of Jesus Christ when it functions as its Lord intended.\"There you have it. When the church of Christ moves in faith-filled expectation, we operate in the fullness and reality of His Spirit living and working inside of us.Whether you are a fiery revivalist or someone who is still on the fence about theAsbury University Revival, I pray that you will ask God to show you how you can be more open to the Holy Spirit manifesting in your life.
