            "inputText": "(CNN) &#8212; Last weekend, British media outlets The Sunday Times, The Times and Channel 4's \"Dispatches\"publisheda joint investigation in which four women claimed the comedian, actor and YouTube sensation Russell Brand had sexually assaulted them in separate instances between 2006 and 2013. One of the alleged victims was just 16 at the time.The Times reporting includes text messages apparently sent between Brand and one of his accusers, in which she tells him: \"When a girl say[s] NO it means no.\" According to the paper, Brand replied saying he was \"very sorry.\" The Metropolitan Policeannouncedon Monday that a further allegation of sexual assault by Brand in 2003 is now under investigation. A Met spokesperson did not name Brand, but said, \"We are aware of reporting by The Sunday Times and Channel 4's Dispatches about allegations of sexual offenses.\"Brand denied the media reports in a video posted on his Instagram account,describing themas \"very serious allegations that I absolutely refute.\"Ardent fansquicklyrose to his defense, while othersclamoredagainst \"mainstream media\"conspiraciestargetingpowerfulright-wingmen. Many wondered publicly why the women didn'tcome forwardsoonerorgo to the police first.Those voices are familiar. Whenever allegations like these come to light, a reliable contingent of observersquestionswhy a survivor might hesitate to speak out or choose not to go to the police.Much of the answer is evergreen. Such experiences are deeply traumatic, and summoning the energy to undergoa long and painful legal process- one that offersvanishingly little hope of charges being brought, let alone a conviction- often asks too much of people already fighting to survive.Taking on their attacker, whether in court or in public, can cause buried pain to resurface. The emotional and financial jeopardy that doing so entails is amplified when the alleged perpetrator is rich, famous and has sufficient resources to make their accuser's life extremely difficult. All these considerations - and more - are heightened in the case of Brand and his alleged victims.The misogyny that pervaded the entertainment industry throughout the early 2000s, which saw paparazzi rewarded for celebrityupskirt shotsand their female targets slut-shamed, was perfectly calibrated to legitimize a character like Brand. He set the bar for his behavior low from day one.After early ventures into comedy, he secured a job as a video journalist at MTV, fromwhich he was firedafter showing up to work dressed as Osama bin Laden on September 12, 2001. He was welcomed back onto the British comedy scene in 2004. Brand'ssexually explicit, demeaning material about women paired with vulnerable stories from his stint in rehab for heroin abuse establishedhis reputationas an offbeat, garrulous lothario: his promiscuity attributed equally to charisma and the apparently involuntary compulsions of aself-avowed\"sex addict.\"By 2006, Brand had his own radio show on BBC Radio 2. In 2007, hecalled Sir Jimmy Savileon air. According to the Times report, he told Savile that he had a personal assistant, and \"part of her job description is that anyone I demand she greet, meet, massages, she has to do it.\" The conversation occurred four years before Savile died, and five years before Savile'shorrific crimescame to light.During a comedy performance in Northampton in 2008, Brandmade a prank phone callto local police saying he'd seen a man responsible for a string of assaults. The police didn't bring charges. Later that year, along with TV presenter Johnathan Ross, he used his BBC Radio 2 show tomake another prank call, this time to the British actor Andrew Sachs.The pair leftseveral voice messageson Sachs' phone, joking about Brand's previous sexual relationship with his granddaughter, 23-year-old Georgina Baillie, insinuating that Sachs might end his own life and then attempting to apologize in further abusive calls.The BBC receivedtens of thousandsof complaints in the weeks after the show aired. It was the first time that theperceived victimof one of Brand's misogynist tirades wasn't the woman in question, but a man who had endured the indignity of being associated with her. It was also the first time that Brand, who wassuspended and then resignedamid the backlash, suffered serious consequences. They were fleeting.Baillie, meanwhile, was humiliated. Speaking to Channel 4 on Wednesday,she saidthat she was \"lucky to be alive\" considering the trauma she experienced, but in the immediate aftermath, she felt there was \"no point in saying anything about this because he's going to get away with it, because he's Russell Brand.\" Her nightmare played out in full view, and the public flocked to congratulate its orchestrator. The lesson was clear: this man is untouchable.In the period during which the assaults reported by the Times allegedly took place and for years afterward, Brand's career went from strength to strength - not only in spite of but in concert with his vile behavior towards women. Brand's 2007autobiography\"My Booky Wook\"details accountsof him spitting in a sex worker's face and smashing another's phone into a wall. Itspentseven weeks at the top of the Sunday Times bestseller list in the UK, and earned him a $3.5 million two-book deal with HarperCollins.His apparent determination totell on himselfdefanged what little criticism ever stuck. Fellow comedians have longacknowledgedthe existence of predators in their midst, but note that the high burden of proof demanded by libel law has always made direct accusations too risky. And asone of Brand's accusershas claimed, those who pulled the strings weren't just willing to overlook sinister behavior - they bent over backward to accommodate it.This is what makes accusing a man like Brand exceptionally intimidating. He is not only rich enough to muster a formidable legal defense; he's also popular enough to enlist legions of fans to echo his rejoinder and shameless enough to self-aggrandize when most would scurry into obscurity.As a rock star comedian who forged a career on the absolute edge of acceptability, he didn't just inoculate the public against his most outrageous excesses. He created a mythology around them, at a cultural moment when women were being villainized in a particularly demeaning, sexual way.Every time he provoked a laugh for a cruel joke or veneration for a salacious escapade, he made his audience complicit in his deviance. If they were ever tempted to turn against him, they'd be forced to interrogate why they hadn't done so sooner. In the meantime, those who continue to ask the question \"What took them so long?\" are only reinforcing the worst fear of every victim who's yet to name their abuser: That no one will believe them.Opinion by Holly ThomasTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
