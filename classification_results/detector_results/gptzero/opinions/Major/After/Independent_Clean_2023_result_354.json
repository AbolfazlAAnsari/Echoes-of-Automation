It would not only provide relief to those struggling in their later years but also acknowledge the changing dynamics of the workforce and the impact of prolonged working lives on individuals’ physical and mental health.The failure to address these pressing concerns not only affects the individuals directly impacted but also reflects poorly on our nation as a whole. We must prioritise the survival of our elderly population and take measures to rectify what is increasingly becoming a national embarrassment. We urge your readers to consider these issues seriously and advocate for meaningful changes in pension policies and retirement age regulations.It is our collective responsibility to ensure that our seniors are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. Thank you for your time and consideration. We trust that you will sign this vital petition, so important steps can be taken to address these concerns and work toward a fair and just system for our elderly citizens.We would strongly urge all readers, to read and sign our petition. this petition will close in the New Year, but watch this space, because it will rise again in a slightly revised form, we will persevere until we haveover a million signatures.Angela Templeton, Karen Burns, Dave Fabian, Denver Johnson, Marion Wilson Thomas, and Michael Thompson"
