The death ofTyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, at the hands of Memphis police last month has shaken the nation. (Officers have been charged with murder.) So far this year, more than 150 bills have been proposed to restrict the rights oftransgender people. And we're headed into the 2024 presidential election with a major candidate - former president Donald Trump - who helped incite a deadlyattackon the country's capitol after the last election and still baselessly claims the 2020electionwas stolen from him.No wonder advertisers think we need some comic relief. But this isn't likely to be a winning strategy for them. That's because the kinds of brands that become iconic \"address the collective anxieties and desires of a nation,\" marketing expertDouglas Holtwrites in \"How Brands Become Icons.\"What has our country so divided right now is questions about diversity and inclusion. In his book \"Why We're Polarized,\" political commentator Ezra Klein says the \"core cleavage of our politics\" is between people who embrace our country's increasing diversity and people who reject it. But embracing it is just common sense from a business perspective: By around 2045, the majority of the US population won't be White, Klein points out. Younger generations also identify asLGBTQmore than older Americans do. Brands should be getting out ahead of these trends with bold messages that help shape our culture.One ad that may buck the trend of brands playing it safe this Super Bowl is M&M'S. The company recently claimed to be putting itsspokescandieson \"pause\" after they got caught up in the culture wars. After the greenM&Mstarted wearing sneakers instead of heeled boots last year, the company received a wave of criticism.Fox News hostTucker Carlsonproclaimed \"M&M's will not be satisfied until every last cartoon character is deeply unappealing and totally androgynous.\" And after the company released packages of M&Ms in colors associated withwomen, outrage ensued on social media and right-wing news networks - a graphic used on a Fox show referred to the candy as \"woke.\"The brand would be smart to stay woke. The actressMaya Rudolphwill appear in a commercial during the game. Hopefully the ad sends a message about the value of diversity and inclusiveness.Of course, it's not that simple. Companies need to first walk the walk - by aligning their business practices and overall identity with an issue - before they can start running ads about it. That might mean taking public stances on issues - whether it's speaking out against bills that would take rights away from transgender people or laws restricting voting rights that disproportionately affect people of color. Companies should also consider donating money to non-profit organizations that work on these issues.Ads with political or social messages can easily backfire if they're not viewed as authentic. Remember Pepsi's widely condemned ad featuring Kendall Jenner and street protests back in 2017? The main reason it backfired was becausePepsiwas seen as trying to capitalize on social problems rather than helping to resolve them.Americans are only becoming more diverse and accepting of different gender and sexual identities. Advertisers that don't register these changes may avoid backlash, but they won't have the cultural impact that keeps us talking about them, either.Opinion by Kara AlaimoTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
