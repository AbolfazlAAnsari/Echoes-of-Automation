            "inputText": "The following is a condensed version of a speech by retired Lt.-Gen. Michel Maisonneuve and his wife, retired Maj. Barbara Maisonneuve, to delegates at the Conservative Party of Canada's annual policy convention in Quebec City on Thursday.We are truly honoured to have been asked to speak to you tonight, at this exciting gathering of freedom-loving Canadians from every corner of our great country.Canada has so much to be proud of. We stopped the Americans in 1812. We gave the world Billy Bishop, Alexander Graham Bell and Lucy Maud Montgomery. We isolated insulin and invented the zipper and the snowblower. In World War One we mobilized 620,000 troops and we were victorious at Vimy Ridge. In World War Two we were brave enough to land at Dieppe. We secured our beach on D-Day. Canada's Elsie MacGill was the world's first female aeronautical engineer. The \"Queen of the Hurricanes\" oversaw the production of over 1,400 fighter aircraft in Thunder Bay during World War Two. We became the world's peacekeepers, with 80,000 of us serving during the Cold War. We beat the Russians on their ice in 1972, and a young man named Terry Fox continues to inspire us all with his unparalleled courage and determination. Even this summer's phenomenon, \"Barbie,\" found her \"Ken\" in Canada. We gave the world the Canadarm in space; we won a world series. When the world changed again on 9/11 in what could be called the start of another world war, Canada stepped up, serving with distinction in Afghanistan.However, the past eight years have seen Canada falter. Our country has been led by a government that has been focused on virtue signalling, apologizing for who we are and how we came to be, erasing our history, and hurting and dividing its citizens. Canada has lost its place on the world stage and more tragically, in the hearts of everyday Canadians.The current prime minister leads by example with his sense of entitlement and complete lack of personal responsibility, and his innate ability to see endless flaws in others but none in himself. It's time to rid Canada of that mentality and a woke agenda that demonizes anyone who dares to disagree and labels them as far-right extremists, fringe radicals and somehow not Canadian.We need to make Canadians believe again. And we need a government that will motivate us to be all we can be, so that Canada can truly be all it can be.Canada has vast natural resources - fresh water, energy power of all kinds, rare minerals and nearly endless agricultural land and forests. These are things the world needs. Instead of ignoring our allies' desires for natural gas and saying there is no \"business case\" for exporting this gas, our country could help others become greener and stop burning coal. To do this, we must support our energy industry, which this government does not seem to understand.The introduction of a \"just transition\" is a final blow to our country's natural resources sector. Adding insult to injury, a carbon tax is strangling Canadians from coast to coast. The deputy prime minister may be able to ride her bicycle to high-end food emporia in downtown Toronto, but many Canadians are wondering if they can afford to drive to a grocery store to buy their families the food they can barely manage to pay for.*****The Liberal government has placed narrow special interests and an obsession with identity politics above our national security. We are no longer taken seriously on the world stage; we are ignored or dismissed by our allies; we do not pay our way in international agreements or organizations. Under this government, we have become free riders. How things have changed.We have had the opportunity to serve with and to command international forces that could not have been successful without finding the common denominator of inclusive leadership. Without sworn enemies, and with a reputation for tolerance and patience and a diverse population of proud immigrants, Canada was the perfect nation to provide leaders. Those were the days when Canada was seen as a natural peacekeeper, and what made Canada a great peacekeeping nation was the prowess of its military, honed during myriad conflicts. Nations looked to us to work together for a common good, with no fear that we were armed with our own political agenda. We were brilliant at this, and Canada was respected.Today Canada is being told to sit at the kids' table by the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal. We were excoriated by a U.S. senator for not pulling our weight in Norad. Even the Economist magazine says, \"Canada's miserly defence spending is increasingly embarrassing.\"*****There is too much potential in our country to let it wane. We must stop apologizing. We need to acknowledge the past and learn from it - not erase it. Our Fathers of Confederation were not perfect, but they created a country that became the Canada we know today. And they did so without a bloody civil war, through the values conservatives embody: common sense, freedom, security, hard work, personal and fiscal responsibility, family, tolerance, free markets, and government that lives within its means.Our proud history is filled with examples of ordinary Canadians with extraordinary courage, stepping up and fighting for justice and freedom around the globe. Those troops are still there - and they need our help. Our Armed Forces have been so degraded that even the Liberals and left-leaning academics and media have noticed. They deserve more than a new dress code. They need personnel, equipment, training and a commitment from the government that Canada will uphold its end of the moral contract. They are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for us, and the least we can do is provide them with the tools they need to fight and protect our freedom.Canada deserves a common-sense prime minister who will unite us all - who will recognize, respect and embrace the differences of this vast country. A prime minister who will make policy that makes us all better off. One who will bring us together with his vision and ensure there is a place for every Canadian on his team. A prime minister for all Canadians, who will unite us, by making us see that we count - that every Canadian counts - no matter who they voted for. If Canadians feel strongly about something, a prime minister should listen, not attack and insult them. If thousands of Canadians feel so strongly about something that they get into their vehicles and drive to Ottawa to be heard, the prime minister should pay attention, not run away at the sight of a bouncy castle.Our party and our leader, Pierre Poilievre, are ready to change Canada for the better. We must stand united and not apologize for being conservatives and having conservative values and principles. Conservative values ??come from the \"peace, order and good government\" of our ancestors. Values ??like freedom in all its aspects - freedom of speech, free markets, freedom of choice, individual freedom, but also a freedom that comes with a responsibility as Canadians. Personal responsibility, to our family, fiscal responsibility, adherence to law and order, national pride and security.Lt.-Gen. (retd) Maisonneuve: Clearing the air about my anti-woke speech(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/clearing-the-air-about-my-anti-woke-speech-before-im-completely-cancelled)Michel Maisonneuve: Canada skipping NATO's largest-ever training drill an embarrassment(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/michel-maisonneuve-canada-skipping-natos-largest-ever-training-drill-an-embarrassment)Let's be proud of the flag that our soldiers wear on their uniforms. This is the flag that should fly front and centre on all our government buildings; the red maple leaf is the flag that can and should unite all Canadians. It stands for all of our freedoms as Canadians without regard to special interests, all equal under the law. Why should we not be patriotic and show it?Respect is another of our important values. Respect for all. Respect for ideas that all Canadians can adhere to regardless of their identity. Respect for our First Nations and their heritage. We need to acknowledge the harms committed in the past - but we also need to work together to move forward in a meaningful manner. We should embrace their knowledge of this land and welcome them as key players in our future and in the management of our resources.As Canadians, we live in a country that should be the envy of the world with almost limitless resources, a diverse and tolerant, well-educated population that can expect great things, because we have achieved great things before. Our country has already demonstrated its ability to take care of its population while contributing at the international level. But right now, many ordinary Canadians can't afford gas; they can't afford groceries or housing, or vacations surfing in Tofino or anywhere else. Frankly, Canadians can't afford Justin Trudeau.After eight years under Trudeau, everything costs more, work no longer pays, the cost of housing has doubled, crime, drugs and disorder are rampant on our streets and the prime minister is dividing Canadians to divert attention from all he has broken.Pierre Poilievre predicted all of these problems. And he has a common-sense plan to bring home the Canada we know and love.He'll bring home lower prices by axing the carbon tax and ending inflationary deficits to bring down interest rates.He will bring back common sense by cutting taxes so people take home more of every dollar earned. He will remove bureaucratic barriers so that newcomers can work in their profession and ensure that Canadians can produce their resources and get them to markets.He will bring back common sense with affordable housing by removing taxes and bureaucratic barriers in order to build, build and build.He will bring home safe streets with jail and not bail for repeat violent offenders; stronger borders to keep out illegal guns; and by ending the ban on licensed and law-abiding hunters and sport shooters. He will protect Canadians.He will bring back common sense with the defence of our freedoms by repealing censorship.In sum, he'll bring home the Canada we know and love - where hard work earns a paycheque that buys nutritious food and a decent home and retirement in a safe neighbourhood and a free country.We need a leader - a prime minister - who will lead. A prime minister who will explain his vision for our country and then tell Canadians why this vision is important. A prime minister who will not govern by polls and appeal to narrow demographics but will do the courageous things to make Canada into the country it can be.And you know who that leader is, don't you? The Conservative party, and our leader Pierre Poilièvre - Canada's next prime minister - will do more than manage our country competently. He will return hope to all Canadians.Canadians deserve a country where they can afford to pay for their groceries. Canadians deserve a country where they can afford a home. Canadians deserve a country with safer communities. Canadians deserve to live in the freest country in the world. Canadians deserve a country governed by a prime minister who has common sense.Canadians deserve Pierre Poilievre as prime minister.Special to National Post !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
