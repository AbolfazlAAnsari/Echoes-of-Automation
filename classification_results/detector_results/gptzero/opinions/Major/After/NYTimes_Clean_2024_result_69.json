I am old and low-income and pay half my Social Security in rent. Yet we have billions to wage war, favor corporations and reward the affluent through tax breaks.The United States should be ashamed that so many people are without homes.Debra J. WhiteGilbert, Ariz.For Chefs, Rewards as Well as ChallengesTo the Editor:Re “30 Chefs, Unfiltered” (Food, Feb. 28):I have been in the restaurant industry my whole life and can affirm that the experiences these chefs are describing are real, but they don’t tell the whole story. What makes the hard days worth it are the days when we hire someone who didn’t think they would ever have the dignity of having a job again or the days when we see a team member who had been struggling with a new skill begin to gain confidence.The hard days are worth it when a recent veteran finds the community working in our restaurant that he feared he would never have outside the military.This year,one in 10 Americans are working in the restaurant industry, where they find flexible schedules, training and skills they can take anywhere, and the sense of community that the hospitality industry can provide.We expect the hard days, and like the guests gathering in our restaurants, we know that a good meal around a table with friends and family can make any celebration sweeter and lessen the sting of the inevitable hard days. It is being part of guests’ and colleagues’ lives that motivates us to keep serving.Jeff LobdellGrand Rapids, Mich.The writer is president of Restaurant Partners Management and chair of the National Restaurant Association.To the Editor:When I was a child, I dreamed of being a chef and owning my own restaurant. As a successful young restaurateur today, I can assure you that the rewards far outweigh the risks and wanted to provide another perspective to your article.While slim margins and too few people in the work force do keep us up some nights, we chefs and restaurateurs have dream jobs, in my opinion. We get to innovate and create, introducing new flavors and ideas to our customers, who enjoy tasting and trying everything we dream up. We get to teach and mentor, artfully showing the next generation of America’s culinary talent how to succeed.I hope more people can see the brighter side of our wonderful industry — I know I certainly do.Eric RiveraMontgomery, Ala.The writer is executive chef at Vintage Hospitality Group and teaches at the Horst Schulze School of Hospitality Management, Auburn University.Atoning for Past HorrorsTo the Editor:Re “With a New Holocaust Museum, the Netherlands Faces Its Past” (news article, nytimes.com, March 5):I applaud the Netherlands for taking the hard road in building the National Holocaust Museum in an effort to document the role of the Nazis and the Dutch in the deportation of 75 percent of the country’s Jews to concentration camps, the highest rate in Western Europe.By creating an oasis of truth and study, the Dutch can learn what happened and why, and try to avoid repeating the horrors of our past.The courage shown by the Netherlands should prod other countries to own up to past horrors and, in doing so, to make for a better future, where we are not judged by the worst thing we have ever done. For example, the United States, for its centuries of slavery, and the Vatican, for its clerical abuse of its most vulnerable, should look to the Dutch for strength and guidance.Ted GallagherNew YorkThis article appeared in print on page A23."
