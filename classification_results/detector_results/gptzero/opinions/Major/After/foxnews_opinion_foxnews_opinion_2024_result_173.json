(Associated Press)(Associated Press)Proof was never an obstacle. Mohammed not only confessed during questioning at the military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after he was captured in 2003, but bragged about his heinous deeds. \"I was responsible for the 9/11 operation, from A to Z,\" he boasted.  Beyond that, a mountain of evidence supported an astonishing 169 overt acts that led to mass murder that terrible day.But the government’sincessant blunderingwas compounded by then-President Barack Obama who decided, without regard to the families of victims, to drop the military case in favor of a federal court trial, effectively rescuing the defendants from their own imminent convictions and probable executions.FDNY UNION SLAMS 9/11 PLEA DEAL: ‘WE ARE DISGUSTED AND DISAPPOINTED’The cacophony of public condemnation and an act of Congress eventually forced Obama to reverse course, sending the entire legal process back to square one. But in a vindictive maneuver, he then deepened the legal quagmire by issuing an executive order to unilaterally alter the Manual for Military Commissions which governs procedures.To his credit, President Trump directed that no plea deals would be accepted. He refused to negotiate with terrorists, even in a military court. The prosecutions moved forward, only to wither when Joe Biden assumed office.Obama’s foolish meddling triggered an endless string of ludicrous delays through meritless motions and trivial appeals. The precept of a speedy trial, guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and incorporated into military law, was ignored. Any sense of urgency or timeliness was abandoned. Bereaved 9–11 families were all but forgotten and their unimaginable grief discarded.To his credit, President Trump directed that no plea deals would be accepted. He refused to negotiate with terrorists, even in a military court. The prosecutions moved forward, only to wither when Joe Biden assumed office.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONIn addition to being the architect of the worst terrorist attack on American soil, Mohammed admitted that he personally decapitated Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in a gruesome atrocity displayed on video. He also claimed credit for \"shoe bomber\" Richard Reid’s failed attempt to explode a passenger jet over the Atlantic Ocean.In his confessions, Mohammed said he yearned for death to become a martyr to the Al Qaeda cause. But pompous cowards often have a change of heart as the gallows draw near.Mohammad and his 9/11 accomplices have been held for two decades at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba.(AP)Now, in a national disgrace, our government has chosen to appease Mohammed and his fellow terrorists by liberating them from death sentences. This sends an unambiguous message to all terrorists elsewhere that the U.S. is weak. They, too, can slaughter Americans with impunity and without facing the ultimate consequence.Biden insists he played no role in the decision. Don’t believe it. Ending the prosecutions moves him closer to his campaign promise of shuttering the Gitmo facility. He doesn’t care about justice or the anguish and heartbreak of thousands of families who lost their loved ones and continue to mourn.In this tragic way, the victims of 9/11 did die in vain. The injustice represents an indelible stain on their sacred memories. Two thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six people had their lives taken that day by savage acts. Yet, their murderers get to live.America today is a sadder place.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GREGG JARRETTGregg Jarrett is a Fox News legal analyst and commentator, and formerly worked as a defense attorney and adjunct law professor.
