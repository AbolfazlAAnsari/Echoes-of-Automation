He thinks the only way forward is a true democracy – one person one vote, where everyone has equal rights.He acknowledged that some people might think this is a fantasy, given that so much anger and hatred exists between the two communities, but the pattern of violence which keeps recurring every few years cannot go on.“We should first of all go for a very rapid deal and a very generous deal to release all the kidnapped Israelis and all the Palestinian prisoners in jail,” he said. “If we not do, we will lose all the kidnapped Israelis.“Satisfying justified emotions cannot be the only guide in such times... What does Israel get out of killing more and more innocent civilians? What will come out of it? Just more hatred, more frustration, and more will suffer... We have to get to the roots of things, and above all open the cage of Gaza.“We know that the way of fighting, killing, bombing, never leads anywhere. What is the purpose? How will it end and what will it be the day after? That is the question. I don’t know how it ends. I only know how it starts. Change this reality.”I couldn’t agree more.Genevieve FordeAotearoaThe right to defend – not seek vengeanceMost people I talk to have no resources left to cope with viewing and reading about thetragedy that is unfolding in the Middle East.  The “massacre of the innocents” on both sides is once again leading us to question what it is to be human and I am staggered to admit that amidst this catastrophe I still have time to be angered by the shallow meaningless outpourings of Western leaders.Something tells me thatBiden would like to be the honest brokerbut I see no glimmer of hope in theutterances of Rishi Sunak.  They both hide behind the meaningless trope of “the right to defend oneself”. Since when did the “right to defend oneself” justify violent retribution? No modern democratic society would incorporate such an explosive interpretation in its legal system.Although the utterances of our present home secretary never cease to amaze me, I cannot believe that even she would want to see retributive justice in our society. At the very least the consequences for basic human rights in our country would be horrific. The return of capital and corporal punishment would certainly once again become part of our society.Is it too much to expect in our world that honesty and consistency will ultimately triumph over populism and self-interest? As I look at yet more pictures of tragedy and grief on both sides I need to believe so.John DillonBirminghamThere are now more slaves in the world than when slavery was legalI am a second-year Geography student at Newcastle University, currently enrolled in a political geography module.I would like to convey my support for the investigative journalism carried out byEmiliano MellinoandMatthew Chapmanregarding theUK modern slavery cover-up by the Home Office.  I have been following the developments of this story ever since the first article was released andtoday’s article is even more harrowing.Countries like the UK are deemed to be advanced in development, yet articles like these question whether this is in fact true.For example, Banerjee states it’s over “187 years after slavery was abolished in the UK” however “there are now more slaves in the world than when slavery was legal.”The Home Office’s slashing of job cuts by £8m is appalling, especially as it appears they assumed this would have little consequence.Catherine Broomfieldargues that “farming interest groups tend to frame ... migrant labour as an economic rather than a social issue.”Therefore I commend The Independent for digressing from the norm and publishing articles that are candid; informing our naivety of critical issues in today’s society. I look forward to seeing how this story further develops.Jessica MonteiroNewcastleBe careful what you wish forPresumably, if the Met Police aregranted more powersto deal withextremist rhetoric, we can then expect the early arrest ofSuella Braverman?P J PeacockHarrowWith flying coloursNicola Sturgeonis to be congratulated onpassing her driving test.  After her failure to cut NHS waiting times, to shrink the attainment gap, to tackle Scotland’s horrific drug-death problems and – I imagine of most regret to the former SNP leader – multiple futile attempts to stageindyref2, isn’t it super she has at last one achievement of which she can be proud?Martin RedfernRoxburghshireHuman, all too humanYour anonymous correspondent’swell-balanced appraisalof the Palestinian-Israeli conflict ends with the flawed assertion that the first step to overcoming the carnage in Gaza would be “for both sides to see each other as human beings, not as animals”. The human animal is the one species that habitually commits acts of exploitation, cruelty, torture and genocide – whilst creating weapons that are capable of obliterating all forms of life – in its vain attempt to maintain hegemony over others.Perhaps the human animal would have done better in the past and acted responsibly in the future if it were to acknowledge its place withinthe animal kingdomrather than seeking to divorce itself from the natural world of which it is a part.Graham PowellCirencester"
