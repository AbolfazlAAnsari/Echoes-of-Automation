If these votes pass, teachers could walk off the job and students will be stuck at home, just as they were last year.Not surprisingly, money is the main sticking point.

But the data tell a different story.

Unions cannot claim spending increases have failed to keep pace with the cost of living when for most of the last decade increases consistently exceeded the rate of inflation.Financial experts long ago raised the alarm about the unsustainability of Ontario's education spending. In 2012, Don Drummond's report(https://www.opsba.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/drummondReportFeb1512.pdf) on public service reform argued that the province needed to cap total education spending, cut non-teaching positions and end provincewide full-day kindergarten.Drummond, former senior official in the federal Department of Finance, also recommended that the government adjust salary scales so teachers no longer receive automatic increases when they complete extra years of university education.

At the moment, Ontario provides no funding for independent schools, which means parents who wish to enroll their children in non-government schools must pay the full cost of tuition. And yet, independent school enrolment in the province continues to rise(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/parents-deserve-more-school-choice-in-ontario). One possible reason, of course, is that students in independent schools do not have to worry about their teachers going on strike.In real terms, the Ontario government is spending more on public education than ever before. Keep that in mind next time you hear union leaders claim the system is underfunded.Michael Zwaagstra, who teaches in a public high school in Manitoba, is a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
