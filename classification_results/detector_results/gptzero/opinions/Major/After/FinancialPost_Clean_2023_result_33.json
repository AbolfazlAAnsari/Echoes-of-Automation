            "inputText": "By Rhys KesselmanLast month's federal budget(https://financialpost.com/tag/federal-budget-2023/) proposes the first significant reforms to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) since its introduction in 1986. They would target the tax more on upper-earners and roughly treble its revenues (though they would still be less than one-half of one percent of all federal personal income taxes). But the reforms would further complicate an already complex system and some of its provisions are perverse. It would be better to scrap the AMT and institute more basic reforms to the regular tax.The budget more than quadruples the AMT's antiquated exemption level, so fewer taxpayers will be affected. It raises the flat rate of tax on AMT income by 5.5 points to 20.5 per cent. And it broadens the AMT base in several ways. Still, for most high earners the AMT will have limited impact, and even for those most affected the bite will be small compared to their true incomes.Although more than 300,000 tax-filers have incomes above $250,000 the reformed AMT is forecast to affect just 32,000 taxpayers per year. The most impacted will be the 8,200 filers with incomes above $1 million who will pay 80 per cent of the AMT's increased annual revenue of $600 million. Their average income is about $2 million, so the new revenues represent about three per cent of their incomes. The average impact will be even smaller in proportionate terms for taxpayers at $500,000 incomes, though the budget offers few details.Some changes to how the AMT reform calculates income subject to tax are curious. It will disallow 50 per cent of deductions for disability supports, workers' compensation, social assistance and Guaranteed Income Supplements. The AMT's exemption level is projected at $173,000 in 2024, and very few people at that income or higher will have any such deductions in their regular tax.Other notable changes to the AMT taxable base are: including 100 per cent of capital gains (up from 80); adding 30 per cent of capital gains on charitable donations (up from zero); and disallowing 50 per cent of most non-refundable tax credits, capital loss carry-forwards, business investment losses and deductions for investment interest expense and for child care expenses.Changing the treatment of capital gains on charitable donations and non-refundable tax credits is a hard hit on donations by high-net-worth taxpayers. And disallowing parts of various expenses directly associated with earning incomes violates a basic premise of an income-based tax: we tax income, not what's spent to earn it. The reform also penalizes taxpayers whose incomes fluctuate year-to-year and will force investors to anticipate whether they'll be subject to the regular or the alternative tax in future years.Finally, the reforms will make the current eight-page (!) AMT schedule T691(https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/cra-arc/formspubs/pbg/t691/t691-22e.pdf) even longer, and the provinces will likely follow suit with greater complexity in their own AMTs.Instead of further complicating the AMT, it would be better to scrap it entirely, incorporate its key points into the regular tax system and adopt a much simpler approach. For filers with income above $250,000, say, or capital gains above $50,000, raise the inclusion rate on capital gains above that threshold to 75 per cent and cap tax credits on dividends from large corporations at, say, $20,000. In addition, restore income averaging (to be fair to taxpayers with highly variable incomes) and limit deductible interest expense on investments to the associated taxable income (as Quebec does).Currently, the effective tax rate (ETR) on capital gains for top earners, who receive a very high share of all such income, is 16.5 per cent (50 per cent inclusion times the 33 per cent top rate). Under the existing AMT, the ETR on gains is just 12 per cent, though this would rise to 20.5 per cent under the proposed reforms. In contrast, with my proposed approach taxpayers above the specified thresholds would face an ETR of 24.75 per cent - higher than the proposed AMT reforms but still lower than the regular top rate and hardly excessive.What's good for Volkswagen better be good for Canada(https://financialpost.com/opinion/whats-good-volkswagen-better-good-canada)We should dock the pay of politicians who break their fiscal promises(https://financialpost.com/opinion/dock-pay-politicians-break-fiscal-promises)Canada's nonsensical wireless plan: opinion(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-canadas-nonsensical-wireless-plan)This approach would be far simpler than AMT reform, its effects on investment tax incentives far more transparent, and its impact on top earners and revenues larger. The exact revenue increase would hinge on the thresholds and design chosen, but based on available estimates(https://financesofthenation.ca/2023/04/04/a-capital-gains-tax-reform-simulation-model/), could be up to eight times that for the budget's AMT proposals.The official proposals do target the AMT better and increase revenues, but their drawbacks offset those benefits. Rather than focusing on the relatively few high earners who pay minimal tax, it would be better to reform the regular tax system for taxpayers with income or capital gains above specified thresholds. That would catch most low-tax high-income persons, while simplifying the system and making almost all very high earners pay a larger share of taxes, which is the reform's intent.Rhys Kesselman is professor emeritus at the School of Public Policy, Simon Fraser University.
