The \"Prey\" star said that he has a \"firm and fervent\" belief in God.\"It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting.\" (Ecclesiastes 7:2)Recently my wife and I attended a funeral . . . another funeral. At our age, we’re going to a lot more of these than weddings. Maybe at your age you are, too. And according to the above quote from the \"wisest man who ever lived,\" I guess attending funerals is a good idea. Right?During the service there were tributes to the deceased—a man named Wayne who hadlived a full lifeand died at a ripe age. Family members, long-time friends, and business colleagues reminisced with the small congregation about some of the things they remembered about him. His daughter recalled especially lovely and happy things about her dad. For all these people, Wayne was what the Bible refers to as a patriarch and what he left behind is what we call \"legacy.\"THE ONE KEY THING MY WIFE TAUGHT ME TO DO AFTER HER DEATHSitting there in that service, I was reminded that I am also a patriarch and what I’m leaving behind when I step into eternity is my legacy. My wife, sitting at my side that day, is a matriarch and what she will leave behind is her legacy. At our funerals, whenever they happen down the road, we will be remembered.(iStock)Before you let your eyes move to the next paragraph, could I ask you to stop for a moment, so that I can say something really important? You, too, are (or one day will be) a patriarch or a matriarch. Andat your funeral, people will remember you. They may even refer to those you leave behind as part of your legacy. And even though you’re currently alive and, hopefully, vibrant, thinking about these things, while perhaps a challenge, is so important.For many years, there were two large portraits that hung in my parents’ home—one of my paternal grandfather and another of my maternal grandfather. These were important men to me.While both were farmers and parish ministers, the two men could not have been more dissimilar.Grandpa Wolgemuthwas an immaculate, focused, intense man. One of the most prominent rooms in his home was his study, the bookshelves lined with important volumes. His car was never dirty. I can still see him headed toward the barn with a single bucket of water to wash it. Thick, black eyebrows and furrowed crevasses across his forehead let us know that he was on a mission. He embodied hard work and the serious business of life.THE SECRETS YOU MUST SHARE BEFORE YOU DIEGrandpa Dourte, my maternal grandaddy, was in love with life. His laughter filled every room of their home. Music from his harmonica cheered us for part of the day; his humming and silly rhymes took care of the rest. The two most memorable places in his home were the parlor with a player piano—he loved music—and his workshop in the shed—he loved building things.At your funeral, people will remember you. And, right now, people are paying attention to you and how you are living your life.(iStock)How well I remember these two men. As a young boy, I studied their every move, I listened to their voices, and I believed what they believed about life and about faith. And why shouldn’t I have? They were patriarchs. Men who left a legacy. Men who set the pace for a host of others who would come behind them—including me.If you’re a parent, someday your children will probably have children. Then they will have children who will have children. And each of these people will know you, either because they remember you or because they hear stories about you from others. Even if you don’t have kids, there still are plenty of younger folks paying attention to you. And when you’re gone, they’ll hear about you. You will be their patriarch. Their matriarch.Who we are, how we laughed and treated others, and what was truly important to us will become known to many people. What an awesome thing this is.THE ONE THING YOUR CHILDREN WANT FROM YOU BEFORE YOU DIESo, when one of my children or a close friend speaks at my funeral, what would I like for them to say about me? And, since you’re here reading this, what would you like for people to say about you?Robert Wolgemuth is a former president of Thomas Nelson Publishers, the founder of the literary agency Wolgemuth & Associates, and the author of more than 20 books.Here's my list of five things this patriarch is hoping for:I often move way too fast, zooming past people instead of saying \"hello.\" I need to be intentional about slowing down, even stopping to look at them with a smile on my face. And if they speak, I want to do what hearing impaired people have taught me: to listen with my eyes.My mother used to say, \"If you’re going to say something, say something nice.\" She’s been gone a long time but she lived this. Her name was Grace. And she was exactly that. Her words made sure of it. Even when she was in her nineties, people looked forward to being with her. They counted on her sweet words.My hero in this space was a man named Don. He’s gone now, but in his later years he learned to play the piano andspeak Spanish. His nose was often in a book or an interesting article, never allowing himself to be passive about new information. Even as an older man, he did his best to keep up with news about his progeny, world events, and the latest technologies.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONEven though being thoroughly independent is a quality many people prize, my aspiration is to live broken and dependent onthe One who created me.
