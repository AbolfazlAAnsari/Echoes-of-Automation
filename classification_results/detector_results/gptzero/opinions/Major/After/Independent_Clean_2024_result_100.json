Suppose we reduce our overseas aid further: 200,000 women across Africa will be left vulnerable to unsafe abortions, 500,000 women and children in Yemen without access to healthcare, and 27,000 children in South Sudan suffering from severe acute malnutrition untreated. It could result in the postponement or cessation of programmes in Somalia that fight against female genital mutilation. It could also critically impact education programmes in Pakistan and Afghanistan, reduce financial inclusion projects in Nigeria, destabilise electoral processes, and eliminate impactful civil society organisations.The UK has always been a global leader in poverty reduction. If we want to achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030, we must continue to act as such.Isabelle HickmanWolverhamptonOne size won’t fit allI am writing in response to The Independent’s recent coverage on themental health of male veterans.Progress continues to be made to ensure veterans receive the support they need. However, these figures are a timely reminder of how much more work needs to be done.Since 2021, we have experienced a 70 per cent increase in demand for ourmental health servicesfrom veterans – reasons for this are complex, including PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Given that the transition back into civilian life can be extremely tough, the reality is that a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to move the dial in addressing the issue.More questions must be asked about the unique mental health challenges veterans are facing across the UK, ensuring they have access to a clear and compelling pathway to high-quality, tailored support in their local area. In the face of such statistics, this needs to be addressed with urgency.Tony HultonWarminsterTaking a page from TonyIt appears that the majority of UK citizens want our government to cease supplying arms to Israel, even though thequantity is relatively small.  Yet Rishi Sunak andhis party have ignored usand even have the effrontery to tell us that their lawyers say that no humanitarian laws are being broken.Putting to one side anyconsideration of moral law, have they considered that they do not need to seek legal advice to terminate weapon sales, and they would certainly not be breaking any laws?Apparently, the UK continues to followTony Blair’s policy of toadying upto the USA.John PeacockSomersetThis is only the startMany of thoseorphaned from Gazawill look in later life for someone to blame, and it won’t be Hamas. Can Israel not see see that the hurt they are inflicting upon a defenceless population is onlyopening the door for Hamasto recruit and radicalise those who have now lost everything?We will likely see the consequences of this war ripple out for years to come, all because there has been no wisdom in the response to thetragic attacks of 7 October.When will it end?Simon WatsonWorcestershire"
