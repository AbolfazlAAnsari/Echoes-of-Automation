On the eve of the Roe reversal just over one year ago (but after a leak to the press meant that voters already knew its fate), confidence in the court \"reached a new low in Gallup's nearly 50-year trend,\"the polling outletwrote. \"Twenty-five percent of U.S. adults say they have 'a great deal' or 'quite a lot' of confidence in the U.S. Supreme Court, down from 36% a year ago and five percentage points lower than the previous low recorded in 2014.\"Themost recent installmentof the General Social Survey also found confidence in theSupreme Courtin 2022 had sunk to its lowest point in at least 50 years, with just 18% of Americans saying they have a great deal of confidence in the court.But Democrats shouldn't take that as carte blanche to beat up on any decision the Supreme Court makes that they don't like. Their support of affirmative action and student loan forgiveness are a case in point.Consider that in the nation'spreeminentbluebastionof California, Bidenromped to victoryagainst Trump. Yet on the same ballot, voters rejected57%-43%a measure repealing California's 1996 ban on affirmative action.Biden routed Trumpin Washington state as well, but a year earlier votersrejected a ballot measureto reverse the state's 1998 ban on considering applicants' race in admissions.Years-long polling showsviews on affirmative action are mixed, but that support for the policy declines as questions become more specific. Just Sunday, a snapABC News/Ipsos pollafter the high court struck down affirmative action found that 52% of Americansapproved of the decision, while only 32% disapproved (16% didn't know).The Biden student loan proposal has found more support in polling than affirmative action generally does, yetit still doesn't garner a majority. And its support resides much more withyoung peoplethan older Americans - and the latter vote at amuch higher rate.On these two issues, the GOP also benefits from having sound-bite-ready rebuttals to liberal criticism - easily digestible and familiar lines that boil down complex public policy issues. In the conservative view, justices finally put an end to the \"reverse discrimination\" of affirmative action, a characterization going backto the 1970s.Conservative support for the Supreme Court's student debt ruling, meanwhile, was neatly encapsulated by the phrase, \"You take out a loan, you pay it back,\" whichSen. Tim Scottof South Carolina, a Republican presidential candidate, tweeted on Friday. His refrain is more likely to stick in voters' minds than Democrats' complicated formulations about the skyrocketing costs of college education and how student loan relief fits into potential solutions.This isn't to say that Supreme Court rulings can't be fertile ground for Democratic political assaults in the Biden era. But it is to say that the party has to pick its spots, and that blanket condemnations that the court rules \"by fiat\" or isn't \"normal\" could backfire.Where the Democrats can more confidently harness Supreme Court discontent is on the issue of reproductive freedom.The opinion in Dobbs v. Jacksonoverturning Roe elicited almost immediatepolitical support fortheDemocrats' positionlast year. Moreover,political professionals widely creditedthe Dobbs decision with prodding Democratic voters,angry at the court's ruling, to turn out to prevent what had been expected to be ared wave during the 2022 midtermelections.Another test of the political winds on Democratic campaign plans over abortion comes this summer through an effort toenshrine abortion rights in Ohio's constitution. If deemed to have enough valid signatures, thedeadline for which was Wednesday, the proposal would go before Ohio voters in November. But anti-abortion forces are holding aspecial election in early Augustto raise the threshold for passing an amendment to the state constitution from a simple majority to 60% in a clear effort to stop the amendment's passage.In Wisconsin and other battleground states, Democrats are already making abortion afront-and-center issuein US Senate campaigns even though Republicans have yet to pick candidates in some places. There's reason to think this could be effective.In April, Democrat-backed candidate Janet Protasiewicz won a Wisconsin state Supreme Court seat by leaning into her support for abortion in campaign ads.The Supreme Court's abortion ruling will undoubtedly continue to be a tool in the Democratic Party's political arsenal. But with the high court's term now over and the 2024 election season on the horizon, Democrats find themselves in the position of having their attacks on the conservative majority at least somewhat neutralized. That's a political blow for Democrats, if not a fatal one.Opinion by David MarkTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
