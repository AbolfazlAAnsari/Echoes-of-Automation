We need lawmakers and public health officials to lead the way out of this failure and provide Americans with a way to save — not punish — people with substance abuse disorders.Peter ProvetNew YorkThe writer is the president and C.E.O. of Odyssey House, a nonprofit that helps people overcome drug addiction.Cleareyed About PutinTo the Editor:Re “Year of Conflict Has Left Europe Forever Changed” (front page, Feb. 26):The observation in the article’s subheadline, “Peace Mentality After Cold War Gives Way to an Embrace of Military Power,” seems premature. While the central and eastern European countries understand the Russian threat and want to see a clear Ukrainian victory, the recent talk of peace negotiations by Germany, France and Britain shows that they seem to expect a return to relatively normal relations with Russia.They clearly fail to accept that Russia and its axis of allies (China, Iran and North Korea) have ambitions that cannot be placated any more than appeasement was effective to stop Hitler and the Axis powers before World War II.Vladimir Putin has similar motivations, goals and methods as Hitler. The West must view Mr. Putin and his allies as existential enemies and quickly eliminate dependence on the resources and products of these countries.Ron KurtzAlpharetta, Ga.Praying PrivatelyTo the Editor:Re “Adams’s View on Church and State Creates Stir” (news article, March 1):Regarding Mayor Eric Adams’s idea that we need prayer in school, as others have pointed out, as long as there are math tests, there will be prayer in school.The question is, Why does Mayor Adams want organized public prayer? In the Bible, Jesus advises his followers to pray in secret: “But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen.” Perhaps Mayor Adams is not familiar with that passage.Howard KartenBoston‘Fox Deserves to Pay’To the Editor:Re “Murdoch Acknowledges Fox Hosts Endorsed Election Falsehoods” (front page, Feb. 28):The damning evidence keeps piling up showing that senior management allowed an out-of-control faction of the Fox News team to knowingly spread incendiary false information.If Dominion Voting Systems wins its defamation lawsuit against Fox News and is awarded the $1.6 billion it is suing for, it would exceedFox Corporation’s net incomefor fiscal year 2022. That would be a substantial hit to Fox, and one that will presumably have deep repercussions.Fox didn’t just damage Dominion. It damaged all of us. Fox intentionally lied to viewers with complete disregard for the destabilization wreaked upon the government and upon the people of the United States.For all of this damage, Fox deserves to pay.William GoldmanLos AngelesThis article appeared in print on page A19."
