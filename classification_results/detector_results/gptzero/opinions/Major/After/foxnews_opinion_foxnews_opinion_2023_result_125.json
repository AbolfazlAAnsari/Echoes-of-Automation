Remarkably, these scholars found that boys who spent more of their childhood in a unionized classroom had lower (four percent) earnings and reduced labor force participation rates as adults.But that’s not all. A year after the Cornell team’s study, Michigan State’s Strunk and Cowen reanalyzed the research on teachers unions. This time they offered an even stronger endorsement of the union rent-seeking hypothesis. \"Because… unions may drive up [school] district costs… we conclude that at the time of this writing an evidence-based appraisal of union impacts supports the notion that union priorities (especially those won at the bargaining table) do not necessarily align with academic success in the classroom.\"This evidence shouldn't surprise anyone. They are the teachers' union, after all, not the kids' union.But once again, don’t take our word for it. In the past, union leaders have sometimes been candid about these dynamics. In 1997, for example, the president of the nation’s largest teachers union (the NEA) acknowledged in a speech at the National Press Club that, \"in some instances,\" the union had, \"used its power to block uncomfortable changes to protect the narrow interest of our members, and not to advance the interests of students and schools.\"Teachers’ union boss Randi Weingarten gives a speech outside the Supreme Court on Feb.  28, 2023.(YouTube screenshot/Student Debt Crisis Center)Randi Weingarten must know her claim is bogus. That’s probably why she closed her replies – likeshe closed the schools– when she tweeted out her opinion piece. If she really believed her claim were true, then she wouldn’t be so terrified of a little school choice competition, either.To be sure, unions are not solely to blame for everythingthat ails American education. But as Stanford University’s Terry Moe explained long ago, \"Some things are obvious. It is not good for children that ineffective teachers cannot be removed from the classroom. It is not good for children that teachers cannot be assigned… where they are needed most. It is not good for children that excellent young teachers get laid off before mediocre [senior] colleagues. Yet these are features of… American schooling that the unions fight for, in their own interests.\"Those are some important additional facts to consider, but don’t expect Weingarten to be honest about them.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MICHAEL HARTNEYCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY COREY DEANGELISCorey DeAngelis is a senior fellow at the American Federation for Children.Michael Hartney is a fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution."
