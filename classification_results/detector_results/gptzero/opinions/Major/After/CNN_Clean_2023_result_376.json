The court instead faithfully applied its precedent,including a case from 1986that sets out a three-part test for these cases. Alabama's argument would have required the court to abandon that case.As Chief Justice Roberts noted for the majority, \"The heart of these cases is not about the law as it exists. It is about Alabama's attempt to remake our ยง2 (Section 2) jurisprudence anew.\" Although it's shocking that a conservative majority did not once again rewrite the Voting Rights Act to narrow its protections, that fact should not absolve the court of the harm it has created in its voting rights jurisprudence.First, the court allowed this illegal Alabama map to go into effect for the 2022 midterm election, meaning that Alabama voters elected their congressional representatives using unlawful maps. The lower court hadstruck downthe map in January 2022, ordering the state to redraw a map with two majority-Black districts.Just two weeks later, the Supreme Courtput that lower court opinion on hold, allowing Alabama to use the map, even though there was plenty of time left before the election to draw a new one. That decision had a tangible effect: Republicanswonsix of the seven seats - all but the one majority-Black district.The same thing happened in Louisiana: the Republican-controlled legislaturedrew a congressional mapin which Black voters were a majority in only one district, though a fair map would have included two. A lower courtruledthat the map likely violated the Voting Rights Act but the Supreme Court put thatorder on holdlast summer as well. Republicansended up winning five of the six districtsin Louisiana in 2022.Similarly, a federal court in Georgialetthe state use a map in 2022 that it said was likely unlawful because it diluted the strength of minority voters, citing how the Supreme Court had allowed Alabama to adopt the map for that year. Thus, there were at least three states that used maps in 2022 that courts had found likely unlawful under the Voting Rights Act. Republicanswon a majorityin the House by just five seats.Second, the court's ultimate decision in the Alabama case, to reject an argument that would narrow the protection of the Voting Rights Act,essentiallymaintains the status quo. Voting rights advocates successfully played defense against an attack on that law.But the court's decision does not meaningfully advance the cause of voting rights to require greater inclusion or ease of voter access. It did not lay the groundwork to overrule its prior cases that had essentially removed thepreclearance mechanismof the Voting Rights Act ornarrowly construed Section 2of the Act as applied to voting rules (as opposed to redistricting disputes). Nor did it adopt arobust theoryof voting rights that prioritizes greater inclusivity and equality.Justice Kavanaugh, who provided the fifth vote in favor of the Voting Rights Act,notedin a concurring opinion that he might consider a future argument - propounded by Justice Clarence Thomas's dissent - that \"the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.\" The court's decision therefore might be just a temporary reprieve.To be sure, the Supreme Court's decision is good news: the Voting Rights Act will continue to protect minority voters in redistricting cases, forbidding states from drawing unfair maps that make it harder for minority voters to come together to elect their preferred candidates.Additional litigationmay require fairer maps in several states for the 2024 election and beyond. But it's good news only because the court did not do what many people had feared and harm voters even more.We should expect more from the Supreme Court than a simple refusal to go along with an argument that would hurt minority voters and the cause of equality. Playing defense against further attacks on voting rights isn't enough. The court should adopt atheory of robust voter participationto pave the way for universal democratic participation and uphold the right to vote as the most fundamental right in our democracy.Opinion by Joshua A.
