One is to peacefullyreunify with the South,the other is tonormalize relationswith the US. Both of these seem to have been discarded.Kim just ended the policy of peaceful reunification, calling South Korea the DPRK's\"primary foe\" and \"principal enemy,\"ordering the demolition of Pyongyang's giant Arch of Reunification monument, built by his father, and disbanding state agencies tasked with reunification.Simultaneously, he said North Korea tested, among other weapons, medium-rangehypersonic missiletechnology that could allow attacks on the South to dodge antimissile systems.South Korea is responding with equally forceful rhetoric. On Tuesday, at a cabinet meeting in Seoul, President Yoon Suk Yeol said \"If North Korea provokes, we will punish themmultiple times as hard.\"Carlin and Hecker say what we're hearing is not the familiar Kim bluster. In their view, Kim has had a transformative change of perspective. Above all, they say, he has decided that the strategy of seeking to normalize relations with the United States has failed. That conclusion was reached after the2018 and2019 summitswith then-President Trump. They are not the only ones who say the failure to reach agreement was an embarrassment (perhaps for both) butwas reportedly traumatic for Kim.In 2021, the Biden administration tried to restart talks, vowing to meet \"anywhere, anytime, without preconditions.\" North Korea has ignored the overtures, which the US recentlyrepeated.  Kim, however, passed a law in 2022 declaring, \"no denuclearization, no negotiationand no bargaining chip to trade.\"But there's more happening beyond the failure of talks with the US.Kim has developed a strategic relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, traveling to Russia forwarm in-person meetingsand providing armaments to bolster Russia's depleted arsenal in its war against Ukraine. The two countries deny it, but there's evidence the DPRK has sent more thana million artillery pieces, and the Biden administration saysRussia is using advanced North Korean missilesagainst Ukraine.So, what's Kimthinking?It's impossible to know with certainty, but there's little question that he's at the very least trying to create problems for the West at a time when it has its hands full with two major wars.With the US occupied with other crises, Kim may be wagering that his own hand is stronger; that the US would be more inclined to make concessions.But perhaps most importantly, a military crisis in East Asia, involving top US allies (South Korea and perhaps Japan) would be a boon to Putin, distracting the West from Ukraine just as theMiddle East has already done.It's also possible that Kim is trying to strengthen his negotiating position in advance of a possible new Trump administration. Politico recently reported that, if he's reelected,Trump is planning to offer Kima deal that would lift economic sanctions and allow him to keep his nuclear weapons if he freezes the nuclear program. Trump said the story is a fabrication, without exactly denying the report.The warning about North Korea cannot be ignored, and the US, South Korea and Japan should update their planning.But there are reasons to be skeptical of the argument that a massive assault is in the cards. It's hard to imagine that if he were planning to launch a full assault, Kim would be sending large quantities of his weapons stocks to Russia.And, however erratic, would Kim start an all-out war that he would surely lose?What is beyond question now is that Kim, whose only meaningful relationship used to be with China, has now entered the Russian orbit. His foreign minister was just in Moscow and North Korean media sayPutin will visit Pyongyang.In an echo of the Cold War, the world is dividing in rival camps and no conflict is completely isolated from the others. The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East increase the risk of a new Korean conflict, raising the potential stakes for everyone.Opinion by Frida GhitisTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
