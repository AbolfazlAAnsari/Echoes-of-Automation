The court instructed that this immunity extends not only tochargesbut toevidence. That means prosecutors are not just barred from alleging official presidential acts as crimes; they are further prohibited from even using such acts as proof offered to establish other crimes.The New York prosecution of Trump was politics not justice. That’s why we call it \"lawfare.\" The prosecutors and judge are not concerned about whether convictions ultimately get thrown out on appeal.There is no denying that Bragg’s prosecutors used some of Trump’s official acts to prove their case. Indeed, they called as witnesses two of Trump’s White House staffers.Unsurprisingly then, Trump’s lawyers moved post-trial to have the guilty verdicts thrown out based on the high court’s immunity ruling. Further, they again argued that Merchan should recuse himself. On that score, they claimed the lucrative political work Merchan’s daughter has done forVice President Kamala Harrisshould be seen as more significant now that Harris has replaced President Biden as Trump’s Democratic opponent in the upcoming election.TRUMP'S APPEAL TO LIFT REMAINING PARTS OF NY GAG ORDER DENIEDOn Tuesday,Merchan denied the recusal motion. He had signaled his intention to do so in a letter to the parties last week. He also said he plans to rule on Trump’s immunity claim by Sept. 16. Most importantly, though, Merchan admonished the parties to prepare for the court to move ahead with the imposition of sentence on Sept. 18. He instructed the lawyers to submit promptly any arguments they intend to make on that subject.If we may read the tea leaves, Merchan has already decided that he will deny Trump’s immunity motion. There is, moreover, a high likelihood that he will impose a prison sentence against Trump right after that.TRUMP CAMPAIGN PICKS UP THE PACE, EYES COUNTER-PROGRAMMING DURING DEMOCRATS' CONVENTIONBy the time he’d issued his letter last week, Merchan had had weeks to mull over theSupreme Court’s immunity decisionand Team Trump’s subsequent brief arguing that the guilty verdicts should be tossed out. He told the parties to get ready for sentencing anyway. Obviously, if Merchan had any intention of vacating the verdicts, or of recusing himself, he would not have stuck to the sentencing date.I suspect that Merchan will rationalize that Trump (a) was not charged based on official presidential acts, and (b) would have been convicted even if Bragg’s prosecutors had not introduced arguably immunized evidence. Such a ruling might be wrong, especially on the latter point (at trial, prosecutors described some of the testimony from Trump staffers as \"devastating\"); but Merchan made so many outrageous rulings in the case that it would be foolish to expect him to change course now.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONIn fact, my own view is that, even more than the Supreme Court’s immunity decision, another of its late-term rulings will bolster Trump’s eventual appeal —Erlinger v. United States. There, the court reaffirmed that in criminal cases, important proof elements affecting the potential sentence must be found unanimously by the jury. Merchan, to the contrary, denied Trump the right to a unanimous verdict on the supposed crime (conspiracy to influence the election by illegal conduct) that Bragg alleged Trump was trying to conceal by falsifying his business records. That crime is what turned a misdemeanor into a felony, and what allowed Bragg to get around the two-year misdemeanor statute of limitations.But this brings us to the main point. The New York prosecution of Trump was politics, not justice. That’s why we call it \"lawfare.\" The prosecutors and judge are not concerned about whether convictions ultimately get thrown out on appeal. And it’s not like Merchan is actually going to put Trump in prison; it is virtually certain that Trump will get bail pending appeal, so Merchan can appear to impose a stiff incarceration sentence without any real incarceration — at least for now, and probably ever.The objective here is to enable Vice President Harris and the media-Democratic complex to label Trump \"a convicted felon sentenced to prison\" just weeks beforeElection Day, at a time when Americans will already have started voting in many states, not least the potentially decisive Pennsylvania battleground.Prepare for Merchan to deny Trump’s immunity claim … and strap in for sentencing on Sept. 18.Editor's note: This column has been corrected to reflect that Judge Merchan said he would rule on former President Trump’s immunity claim by Sept. 16, not Aug. 16.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANDREW McCARTHYAndrew C.
