In my lifetime with Type 1 diabetes, I have felt the frustration of the unpredictability of diabetes and how almost every decision that I make during the day has some impact on my glucose control.This means understanding the barriers to getting help. Respondents to the \"Diabetes State of Mind\" survey said issues that impact the mental well-being of people with diabetes range from their ability to manage diet and exercise and attain blood glucose goals to big life transitions, intimacy challenges and ability to speak freely about diabetes and diabetes management needs at work. As for the barriers to getting help for mental health challenges, the survey reported affordability, embarrassment, judgment from friends or family and fear of stigma.There are so many things in life, like getting diagnosed with diabetes, over which people affected have no control. The not-so-secret way to triumph over these is to control how you react to them and what people around you – from families to doctors and employers – do to make you feel supported.The stress of living every day with diabetes and trying to keep it in check can actually make diabetes more difficult to control – stress releases hormones, causing more pronounced fluctuations in blood sugar, making it even harder to keep levels in the target range.The good news is safe spaces for people experiencing mental health challenges will help them be more likely to be proactive about communicating their feelings and needs. Doctors who are more attuned to the physical and verbal cues of mental unwellness in their patients may be able to provide a more holistic approach to treating diabetes, going beyond addressing blood glucose and monitoring for physical complications to also include mental well-being.With 38 million of us living with diabetes in the U.S. and a growing crisis in mental health, especially among America’s adolescents and teens, we can all rest a bit easier knowing there are steps we can take to help get more people the support and help they need and that when they get it, it will make a positive difference.Dr. Brian Ulmer, M.D. is a Roche Diabetes Care Medical Value Partner.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
