HERE ARE CRITICAL CAREER TIPS FROM EXPERTSWhat do I do best?Think about the skills that have always come naturally to you – the things other people say you’re good at. These can be both hard skills (writing, budgeting, etc.) andsoft skills(communication, leadership, etc.).What do I love to do most?These are the activities that seem to make time stop for you – when you’re engaged in them, you forget everything else. You look forward to them, and you might even spend hours learning more about them in your downtime.What results matter most to me?Think about the people you want to help, the problems they have, and the solution(s) to their problem.

CONSIDER THESE ESSENTIAL TIPS FIRST2. Start your job searchIf you know you don’t have enough experience yet in the field you want to pursue, use your free time to take courses, volunteer, intern or do whatever else it takes to get qualified and build your resumé beforestarting the application process.But if you already have some qualifications and experience, start with sites like Indeed, CareerBuilder, Ladders and Glassdoor that let you narrow down your search to your specific location, desired salary and type of job. Some sites even let current and former employees write workplace reviews so you can see what you’d be getting yourself into.3. Connect with who you knowNo awkward networking events necessary. Reach out to people you already know from church, past jobs, internships, clubs, friend groups, etc. and ask if they (or anyone else they know) could help you get closer to the type of job you want. If you can get connected with someone who works for a company you’re applying to, even better!Ask your connections if you can take them to lunch or coffee and get their insight on the job or career field you’re looking at. (Send a thank-you text, email or note afterward to follow up on anything you talked about, and send them your resumé if appropriate.)CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION4.
