Dan Patrick of Texas, who spoke at the event, told attendees that he had urged Trump to hold the rally in Waco because it was centrally located and could attract Trump supporters from around the state -- and that he had been utterly unaware of the 30th anniversary of the violent confrontation involving the Branch Davidians -- an assertion that strains credulity.Trump's rally is what I view as the most anti-American start ever to a presidential campaign by a major party candidate.Standing on stage, he placed his hand on his heart while the recording of a song,\"Justice for All\"played over the speakers. The soundtrack was performed by a choir of people imprisoned for their roles in the January 6 terrorist attack at the US Capitol, interspersed with a recording of Trump saying the Pledge of Allegiance. Footage from the insurrection was played on a giant screen behind the former president.A few minutes into the hour-and-a-half-long speech, Trumpdid make brief mentionof the tornado in Mississippi stating, \"Before we begin, I also want to express our sadness to and send our prayers to everyone in Mississippi and Alabama who has been touched by the devastating tornadoes,\" adding, that \"we love you all.\"He then quickly pivoted to a rhetorical attack on the \"corrupt, rotten and sinister forces trying to destroy America\" and repeated the lie of \"rigged\" elections.As The New York Times reported:\"Trump devoted long stretches of his speech to his own legal jeopardy rather than his vision for a second term, casting himself as a victim of 'weaponization' of the justice system.\"Obviously, Biden, as president, has an ability to help people that Trump does not. But Trump's hands are not tied: He did find a way, after all,to visit the siteof the Norfolk Southern toxic train derailment last month in East Palestine, Ohio, when it suited his political interests.Yet, in the aftermath of a devastating storm that devastated parts of a region where he enjoys broad support, Trump was mostly focused on what he always has been since he entered the world of politics: Trump.Shortly before the close of his speech in Waco, the former president -- who facespotential criminal chargesin various jurisdictions -- rattled off a list of those he believes to be his political opponents from \"the fake news media\" to \"RINOs\" (Republicans in name only) to President Biden. He then vowed to his supporters, \"We will liberate America from these villains and tyrants who are looking to destroy our country.\"By contrast,President's Biden statementclosed with the words, \"To those impacted by these devastating storms, and to the first responders and emergency personnel working to help their fellow Americans: we will do everything we can to help,\" adding, \"We will be there as long as it takes. We will work together to deliver the support you need to recover.\"Again, this -- if we needed it -- is a reminder of why Joe Biden is in the White House, and why Donald Trump was the first president since George H. W. Bush in 1992 to lose re-election.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
