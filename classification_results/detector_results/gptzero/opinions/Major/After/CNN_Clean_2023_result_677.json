But now Putin seems to need him and it's unclear how much the Russian leader is willing to help him circumvent those restrictions, now that the two foes of the West have even more in common, standing at the sharp end of international sanctions.Last week, when US intelligence revealed a meeting was in the works between the two leaders, and national security adviser Jake Sullivan described Russia's discussions with Pyongyang as \"imbued...with anincreased intensity,\" US officials warned North Korea against arming Russia. Sullivan said North Korea will \"pay a price\" if it makes an arms deal with Moscow. But it's hard to imagine what additional leverage Washington has to pressure a country already subjected to stiff sanctions.Kim is said to be looking forsatellite and nuclear submarinetechnology and may also want Russian technology to help accelerate North Korea'sballistic missile program, which could allow North Korea to launch nuclear warheadsas far as the United States.In short, the harmful repercussions of Putin's desperate quest to win his wholly unnecessary war against Ukraine - which has already aggravated afood crisisin poor countries - have now reached East Asia, and could well make one of the world's most dangerous countries even more of a threat to its neighbors and the rest of the globe.Forcountries that believethe war in Ukraine is just another faraway problem, this is a useful reminder of the growing consequences of Putin's war.Opinion by Frida GhitisTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
