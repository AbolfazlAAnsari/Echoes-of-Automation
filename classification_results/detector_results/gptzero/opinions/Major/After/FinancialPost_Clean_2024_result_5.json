Giving Canadian assets this special tax lustre amounts to political interference in pension fund portfolio decisions, which could lead to suboptimal returns less likely to cover the funds' obligations.

Net interest expense in excess of 30 per cent of earnings before the deduction of depreciation, interest and taxes would not be deductible. That would help but wouldn't prevent pension plans from exploiting trust arrangements with the companies they operate.Another option would be to tax the earnings of controlled subsidiaries held by pension plans and other tax-exempt entities (e.g., charities such as university endowment funds). This approach, similar to the U.S. \"unrelated business income tax\" (UBIT), can result in pension plans paying corporate tax on controlled corporate earnings.Harvard and the high economic cost of potholes(https://financialpost.com/opinion/harvard-high-economic-cost-potholes)Overly optimistic Liberals are lowballing government debt risk(https://financialpost.com/opinion/overly-optimistic-liberals-lowballing-government-debt-risk)It's time for the abdication of King Trudeau II(https://financialpost.com/opinion/time-abdication-king-trudeau-ii)On balance, though, we're not convinced removing the 30 per cent rule would create benefits big enough to offset the costs of all this new complexity. To help support the retirement of our aging population, pension and other retirement funds should certainly continue to be tax-exempt. But once tax-exempt status is awarded to some investors and not others, boundaries like the 30 per cent rule need to be imposed in order to minimize the resulting economic distortions and tax erosion. Allowing pension plans to use their tax exemption to take over corporate Canada would be a step way too far.Vijay Jog is Chancellor Professor Emeritus, Carleton University, and Jack Mintz is President's Fellow, School of Public Policy, University of Calgary.Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the business news you need to know - add financialpost.com(https://financialpost.com/ ) to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here(https://financialpost.com/newsletters/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2024 Postmedia Network Inc.
