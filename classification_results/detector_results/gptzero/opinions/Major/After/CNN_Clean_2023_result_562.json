Organizers of the Global Surgical Conference and Expo - which expected to draw around 7,000 people - moved its 2027 event from Orlando to Philadelphia. Orlando tourism officialstoldThe Wall Street Journal that the group cited concerns over policies promoted by DeSantis.The American Educational Research Association pulled its 15,000-person meeting in Orlando after the passage of the DeSantis-championed Fairness in Women's Sports Act, which bars transgender female athletes from participating in women's sports teams. Tony Pals, spokesperson for the group, in an email to CNN,explainedthat the organization would not hold a conference or event in a state such as Florida that has enacted anti-trans laws.Meanwhile, organizers of a \"Game of Thrones\" fan convention recentlyscuttled the eventthat was supposed to be held in Orlando after hearing from attendees that they did not want to go to an event in Florida. Thelistgoes on and on.AsCNN reportedSunday, Stacy Ritter, president and CEO of the Visit Lauderdale tourism marketing agency, noted that 10 events and conventions were canceled by organizations \"citing recently enacted laws, policies and travel advisories.\"In real dollars, that means thanks to DeSantis' \"war on woke,\" there has been a loss of an estimated $20 million in revenue for the state and counting. That's millions of fewer dollars spent in the state's hotels, local restaurants and small businesses.Despite this real impact, DeSantis' press secretarydismissed CNN's story, calling it \"nothing more than a media-driven stunt.\" The spokesman added, \"Under the leadership of Governor DeSantis, Florida's economy is booming.\" Apparently, DeSantis' \"war on woke\" includes denying reality.Organizations and corporations steering clear of Florida are doing the right thing. If you're planning to take your vacation somewhere other than the Sunshine State this year, you are, too.If you reject DeSantis' right-wing war on everything he doesn't approve of, don't spend your money in Florida while those policies are on the books. Remember that in the past, boycotts have caused enough economic pain they have led to changes ingovernment policies.Keep in mind the corporate and professional sportsboycottthat targeted Arizona in the 1990s for refusing to recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday. Remember too, a similar boycott of North Carolina that was carried out, defeating theGOP-championed \"Bathroom Bill.\"The consequences for North Carolina meant millions inestimated lost revenue, especially after the 2017 NBA All-Star Game and NCAA championships were moved from the state. In both Arizona and North Carolina, the GOP government officials ultimately reversed offensive and controversial policies at issue. The hope is professional organizations follow that same playbook now when it comes to Florida.The irony is that DeSantis appears determined to double down on his crusade against \"wokeism\" at the very time that voters seem to be tiring of the issue.The New York Timesreported that a national poll it conducted with Siena College found that when presented with two hypothetical Republican contenders, only 24% of national Republican voters opted for \"a candidate who focuses on defeating radical 'woke' ideology in our schools, media and culture\" over \"a candidate who focuses on restoring law and order in our streets and at the border.\"So all of the governor's bluster about waging a \"war on woke\" may be for naught - at least as far as voters are concerned.DeSantis repeatedlyhas declaredthat \"Florida is where woke goes to die.\" In reality, Florida is a state that organizations are avoiding, teachers are fleeing, and some tourists are actively avoiding. The only question is, how many more have to suffer in his state before DeSantis ends his war to move America backward.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
