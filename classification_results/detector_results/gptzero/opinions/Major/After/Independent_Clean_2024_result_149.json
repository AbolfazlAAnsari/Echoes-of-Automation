In a very rich commuter belt, parents who send their children to private junior schools and/or pay for private tuition to get their children the necessary pass mark, inevitably get the lion’s share of the state grammar school places in the area.The state junior schools hardly get a look in because the pass mark for even the brightest children in the school is beyond them. They then have one school, which whether good, bad or indifferent is the only one they can go to. Or they can find a place in a private school.Parents may not comfortably be able to afford the fees but will sacrifice everything toget their children a good education.  I know of nurses and other public workers who are in that situation. Many grandparents will pay all the fees or half to ensure the same. These are not rich people. These are ordinary people (as Labour likes to label people who work for a living, assuming rich people pick their money off trees).Has Labour thought about the number of extra places it will need if children inprivate schoolsnow have to move to state schools to complete their education; all because sacrificing parents and grandparents cannot afford the extra 20 per cent ontop of already expensive fees? Has Labour properly costed his out? Are there enough spare places to absorb these children? Have they thought about the impact this can have on a child who is happy in their school with their group of friends who now has to move to a state school to start all over again to fit in?All this is probably for a pittance to the coffers of the government when the proper checks and balances have been carried out. Cruel and unnecessary.Cynthia YounisAddress suppliedPoor little rich schoolThe problem withJohn Rentoul’srecent arguments on tax is twofold. The first, on abolishing VAT on private school fees, is that the cost has to be met by parents. The schools are businesses, and when they have a rise in their costs, which this effectively is, they have choices: they can work on reduced profit margins, they can cut costs elsewhere or they can increase prices.When state schools had their budgets slashed by George Osborne through hisausteritymeasures they hadno choice but to cut costs, as that was their only option, just as teachers at those schools who had their pay frozen also had to make cuts at home.With a finite amount of money available to spend on education, and 14 years of inherited problems, I don’t accept the argumentthat private schools should be unableor unwilling to cut their costs and pass price increases onto parents. The idea that it is somehow unfair that they should be exempt from making the same tough decisions that 95 per cent of headteachers have had to make in state schools for the last 14 years is ridiculous.As for the idea thata fairer tax systemdiscourages the footloose rich, that is an argument always made by their representatives or the people who make money from their existence. Perhaps trying a new system would test that argument.Who knows, maybe we would find it’s a better country ifthey did all go offto live in Monaco after all. I doubt we would actually miss them or their money because,from recent tax reports, it’s clear that they don’t really contribute to a healthy and happy society after all.John MurrayBracknell"
