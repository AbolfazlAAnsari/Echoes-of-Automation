Not overhis admitted falsehoods, his apparent misrepresentation about family members fleeing the Holocaust, questions regarding his campaign funding oreven reportson his spending of campaign funds on travel to places such as Miami. (McCarthy has not returned CNN's requestsfor comment about Santos.)This silence is not surprising. It perfectly sums up McCarthy and many in today's GOP who seek power at any cost - with no regard for principle or the greater good of our nation.Even fellow GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz - who has opposed McCarthy's bidfor House speaker - recentlyslammedthe Republican leader for not having any core values,writing in an op-ed, \"Every single Republican in Congress knows that Kevin does not actually believe anything. He has no ideology.\"It's likely McCarthy has declined to condemn Santos because the California lawmaker is so desperateto secure the 218 voteshe needs to be elected speaker when the new Congress is sworn in on Tuesday. (Before this scandal broke, Santoshad pledged his supporton Twitter for McCarthy's speakership bid - but has since apparently deleted that tweet.) Given the incoming House GOP majority will bea razor-thin four votes, McCarthy needs Santos' support if he is to have any chance of becoming speaker.McCarthyhas been outspoken on many other political issues since The New York Times article put the spotlight on Santos. For example, on December 21, McCarthy took to Twitterto slam the January 6 committee, writing in part: \"Pelosi's Select Committee has been focused on political theater and posturing.\" That same day, McCarthy vowed on Fox News that Republicans \"can eliminate waste and wokeism\" when they take control of Congress.McCarthy has also criticized theBiden administration's border policyand played up accusations onFox Business that the FBIworked to suppress news stories hurtful to Democrats.Yet not a peep about the Santos story - which even caused an uproar on Fox News on December 27 when former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as a guest hostconfronted Santosabout his fabrications, asking: \"Do you have no shame?\"But it's not just McCarthy.The GOP leadershiphas largely beensilent about Santos. One of the few senior GOP lawmakers to chime in has been Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee.In remarksThursday on Fox News, Comer described Santos' actions as \"a disgrace, he's lied to the voters.\" But Comer didn't call for Santos to step aside, instead onlysaying he's \"pretty confident\"the House Ethics Committee will investigate Santos.It isn't the first time McCarthy has shown his willingness to abandon principle in the pursuit of power. The most glaring example was his flip-flop on Trump's culpability over the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. McCarthy initially took to the House floorproclaiming about Trump: \"The President bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters.\" McCarthy added, \"He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding.\"It wasn't long though before McCarthytraveled to Mar-a-Lagoto make up with Trump. By April 2021, McCarthywas rewriting historyto defend Trump's actions surrounding January 6. Why? Apparently becauseMcCarthy understoodthat without Trump's support he could never become speaker. And that transaction appears to have paid dividends; a few weeks agoTrump publicly supportedMcCarthy's bid for speaker, urging his allies in the House GOP Caucus to vote for him.Imagine for a moment if an incoming Democratic member of Congress had been engulfed in such a scandal. McCarthy likely would be screaming about how this representative-elect should not be in Congress and how the Democratic leadership needed to denounce this politician.Barring something unexpected, Santos likely will be sworn in as a member of Congress on Tuesday without a word of criticism by McCarthy. This is today's GOP on display. It's a party that stands for nothing except acquiring power at any cost - even if it is gravely bad for our republic.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
