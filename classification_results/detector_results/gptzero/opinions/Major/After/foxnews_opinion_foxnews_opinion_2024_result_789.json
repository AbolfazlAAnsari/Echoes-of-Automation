Israel did the right thing and immediately took responsibility, apologized, and launched an investigation, as it always does. Any civilian death is tragic and should be avoided at all costs â and the death of any American should demand the accountability and apology that Israel has promised and delivered. Israel is doing more to prevent civilian deaths than any warfighting nation has been expected to do in history and taking responsibility when tragic incidents happen.BIDEN WARNS NETANYAHU THAT US WILL CHANGE POLICY ON GAZA UNLESS ISRAEL PROTECTS CIVILIANSThere will be accountability for this tragedy, and we pray that something like this never happens again, but what President Biden and Democrats cannot do is allow it to blind them to the fact that Hamas is still holding Americans hostage, or allow them to ignore the undeniable fact that the United States and Israel have a common security interest indestroying Hamasand getting these hostages back home today.Â Hamas must be destroyed and that means going in Rafah and any other place Hamas is hiding behind innocent civilians.I truly believe that if Netanyahu had taken Rafah when he wanted and destroyed Hamas, the war would be nearly over. But at every step, the U.S. has forced Israel to go slow and all Biden has done with that time is use it to build his attacks on and betrayal of Israel, and forced the hostages to languish in captivity even longer.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThe five Americans that are being held hostage by Hamas have been held in captivity for more than half a year. It is unacceptable that President Biden, senior members of his administration and Democrats in Washington continue to attack Israel, call for the ousting of its democratically-elected government, and allow the abandonment of our ally at theUnited Nationsand on the world stage. And it is disgusting that while they launch these attacks on our ally, Democrats say little or nothing about the fact that American citizens are being held hostage by a brutal, murderous terrorist organization that we know is committing horrific sexual abuse against these innocent people.But speaking every single day about the hostages still being held by Hamas, as I have done since this attack happened, is not enough. While his reported letter to Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamin bin Hamad Al Thani is a start,Biden must do moreto force Qatar do its job in securing the immediate and safe release of all hostages.Qatar has had months to secure the release of hostages from Hamas. How this has not yet been accomplished. Why is Qatar allowing the leaders of Hamas to live in luxury and under protection in Doha while American citizens remain tortured in the captivity of terrorists? That must end now and we need to see concrete evidence today that Qatar is doing its job as a U.S. ally to get our hostages and all hostages being held by Hamas out. Qatar enjoys many of the benefits of being an American ally, including hosting a U.S. military base. If the Qataris wonât do their part to get our hostages out, everything should be on the table in terms of consequences for its inaction.My latest trip to Israel is my sixth visit since I was elected asgovernor of Floridain 2010 and my third as Floridaâs U.S. Senator. The State of Florida and Israel have always had a strong relationship, and each time I visit I am reminded of that bond between our people and the importance of supporting the Jewish state. I will never walk away from Israel and am more committed than ever to forcing the Biden administration to stand by our great ally as it fights for its existence against the unimaginable barbarism of Iran-backed terror.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.
