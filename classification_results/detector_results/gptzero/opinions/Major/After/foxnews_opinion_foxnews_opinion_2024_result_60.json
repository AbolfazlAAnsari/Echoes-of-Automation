But it is also aword, along with outraged, that applies to a range of commentators, not all allied with the former president.Professor Jonathan Turley called the $370 million judgment confiscatory, extreme and abusive. Professor Steven Calabresi termed it a travesty and an unjust political act. The subhead for his online commentary employed the term \"Stalinist.\" Both law professors are right.Because the judgment does not relate to any loss, the $370 million is not, properly understood, violative of the prohibition against grossly excessive punitive damages. It does fall, however, directly within the excessive fines clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.TRUMP BLASTS ‘CLUBHOUSE POLITICIAN’ JUDGE AFTER BEING FINED $350M, DEFENDS THE ‘GREAT COMPANY’ HE BUILTIn an opinion especially illuminating to understand the wrongdoing by the attorney general and Judge Engoron, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Timbs v. Indiana (2019), that the excessive fines clause is an incorporated protection applicable to the states (all of them, even New York)under the 14th Amendmentto the U.S. Constitution.The Supreme Court stated that the clause \"traces it venerable lineage back to at least 1215\" and the Magna Carta. \"Despite Magna Carta, imposition of excessive fines persisted. The 17th century Stuart kings, in particular, were criticized for using large fines to raise revenue, harass their political foes, and indefinitely detain those unable to pay.\" These remain concerns.As the Supreme Court stated in Timbs: \"For good reason, the protection against excessive fines has been a constant shield throughout Anglo-American history: Exorbitant tolls undermine other constitutional liberties. Excessive fines can be used, for example, to retaliate or chill the speech of political enemies, as the Stuarts’ critics learned several centuries ago.\"And excessive fines are a cheap source of revenue, in the case of Trump being a lot of revenue, especially for a state that has been bleeding population and high-income taxpayers.The virtue of anEighth Amendment challengeis that it places the political prejudices of the attorney general and the supine Judge Engoron relevant and front and center. James made getting Trump a centerpiece of her campaign for the post she now holds. All of her statements attacking Trump  are now fodder for the inevitable appeal and attendant stay.TRUMP FRAUD RULING REVEALS NEW YORK'S ‘ASSAULT’ ON REAL ESTATE, ‘MR. WONDERFUL’ SAYS: MOVE YOUR BUSINESS OUTWith this Stalinist judgment, it is no longer Trump who is on trial, but the New York state (in)justice system. Judge Engoron, New York’s version of the infamous Judge Ito, has brought the New York courts into disrepute.The only way to restore even a modicum of confidence that New York will not destroy those with whom it disagrees is for the appellate tribunals to take immediate action to vacate the judgment in its entirety as bringing into disrepute the state’s courts. If the case survives even a day longer than tomorrow, Judge Engoron should be removed from the matter and replaced with a jurist who understands law and justice.Finally, this is not the only case that New York prosecutors have levied against Trump.Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragghas indicted Trump for what is almost universally condemned as a legally meritless alleged crime.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONWhile it is beyond the brief of this column to discuss it in more detail here, it does seem that cooperation by Bragg and James relating to their respective actions against Trump could potentially support a lawsuit by the former president under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and 1985 for violations of his constitutional rights.Congress has the power to investigate the possibility of collusion by these two New York officials, and should do so promptly. They owe it to not only to Trump, but also to all of us, wherever we might live.Arthur Fergenson is senior counsel with Ansa Assuncao LLP. The views expressed are his alone and not those of the firm."
