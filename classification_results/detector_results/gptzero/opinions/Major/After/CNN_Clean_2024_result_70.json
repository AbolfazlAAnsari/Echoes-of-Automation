And though he sometimes seemedawkward on stageat NRA events and tended toavert eye contactin person, he made up for his lack of charisma in his relentless focus on prioritizing gun rights over the right to live safely in a country where peoplefear-and live with the manyconsequencesof -being shot.During the 1990s, the NRA sawinternal divisionsover its political purity and financial problems. During the Clinton administration, therefore, the NRA focused much of its energy at thestate level,successfully enacting numerous \"right-to-carry\" lawsthroughout the country, which provided individuals easier access to concealed weapons licenses. Yet, the NRA alsoexperienced major stumbling blocksduring this period, including the1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act- which imposed waiting periods and background checks on purchasers of handguns - and the now-expired1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban.Significantly, following the1995 Oklahoma City bombingthat killed 168 people byformer NRA member Timothy McVeigh,LaPierre referred in a fundraising letter to federal law enforcement agents as \"jack-booted thugs,\" a term commonly associated with fascism and Nazi SS soldiers. This led the former President George H. W. Bush and many others toresign their lifetime NRA memberships.LaPierre is credited with the renewal and invigoration of the NRA'scultural agendain the years that followed. Herecruitedthe actorCharlton Heston- best known for playing \"Moses\" on the big screen - to \"part the red seas\" in shaping a public image for the NRA. The pair led acampaignthat encouraged civilian gun owners to believe that it was they who were victimized.With LaPierre and Heston leading the organization, the NRA expanded its crusade to broaden gun rights and industry protections and positioned gun control advocates as adversaries in an all-out liberal culture war. Whereas before the 1990s, the NRA's perceived opponents were mainly individuals who lacked rifle training, who were unwilling to fight for the nation, or were \"hoplophobes\" (aterm coined by American marine Jeff Cooperin 1962 to describe an aversion to guns), now the \"enemy\" was muchmore expansive: including progressive social movements, government agencies, \"globalists,\" the UN, and the \"mainstream media.\"In contrast, the NRA praised individual citizen gun rights defenders as patriots, defending individual rights and freedoms. As LaPierre wrote in his 2003 book, \"Guns, Freedom, and Terrorism,\" this battle is \"about suppressing our culture, our heritage, our freedom.\"  He oversaw the rise of NRA's televisual presence, with its own high-end advertising campaign ads, films andNRATV station, which ceased operations in 2019. In 2000 the NRA introduced \"America's 1st Freedom\" magazine, aimed beyond NRA members, to report \"the news from the perspective of the concerned gun owner.\" (LaPierre has written a regular monthly column, \"Standing Guard,\" for the magazine since 1991).Following the1999 mass shooting at Columbine High Schoolin Littleton, Colorado, LaPierre and Hestonmetahead of the NRA's annual meeting in Denver to discuss the group's communications. Heston delivered adefiant message,similar to its position on mass shootings nowadays: The national media was not to be trusted and any conversation about guns and the NRA aftermass shootingswas a vulgar politicization of the issue. They cast gun rights as a religious and moral imperative,invoking comparisons to Nazi Germanyand even hired lawyers who accused critics of gun rights of committing\"blood libel.\"They argued that other rights (includingthe right not to be shot) must be sacrificed in the process.After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the NRA's leadership compared Osama bin Laden's attacks on American freedom with those\"attacks on freedom\"allegedly perpetrated by gun control advocates against gun owners.The NRA's defiant stancecontinued to strengthen. At the group's 2002 meeting in Reno, Nevada, Heston memorablyhoisted a gunin the air and boasted that it could only be taken, \"From my cold dead hands!\" NRA officers' gloating messages to the board contrasted sharply with theirportrayal of threats to gun rightsat the members' meetings. \"The bottom line is, we're on the offense,\" LaPierre proudly announced at the Reno board meeting, meaning that the NRA was able to focus on lobbying for pro-gun legislation rather than against gun control legislation. InOrlandoa year later, he told the board that the NRA is \"stronger and more widely accepted than ever.\"The NRA's approachresonatedwith a rising right-wing, anti-government shift in the Republican Party (as well as withsome Democrats). Under pressure from the NRA and its supporters, in 2004 the Republican-controlled Congress allowed the federal assault weapons ban toexpire.LaPierre and the NRA saw another victory in the 2005 enactment of theProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, whichgranted immunityto firearms manufacturers and dealers from damages resulting from the misuse of their products. The NRAdescribedthe act as \"the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in 20 years.\"Lobbying against the inclusion of firearms in consumer product protections, the organization downplayed the state's collective responsibility for protecting citizens, creating and mobilizing its membership around aslew of laws, policies and social normsthat shield manufacturers, sellers and buyers frommeaningful liability.In December 2012, one week afterAdam Lanza shot and killed 26 peopleat Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, LaPierreannouncedduring a press conference that \"the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\" Thisnarrativehas landed with many Americans who believe that guns areessential for self-protectionand the swift and just resolution of disputes. It alsoshifts the argument awayfrom thecharacteristics of firearms as lethal weapons, to a debate about themoral character, social identitiesandmental statesof the people carrying the gun.LaPierre's resignationbrings to a closean extraordinary era of growth for America's most powerful consumer lobby. He will certainly be remembered for guiding the organization through a bumpy period and for taking the country to new and significantlymore dangerous terrainwhen it comes to guns. Heoversaw the transformationof the NRA from its somewhat bipartisan past to its current status as a highly politicized social movement - and a political project that does not take therealities of gun violenceor the need forequal protection under the criminal justice systemseriously.By both galvanizing gun safety supporters while also emboldening gun rights activists and facilitating a political and cultural evolution whereby defensive homicidesare ever more justifiable in the legal system, LaPierre helped make the debate about guns in America even more contentious while shaping how the country talks about guns, gun control and itself.But does LaPierre's departure mark a turning point for guns in America?It'stoo soon to say, but it's unlikely we'll see significant changes any time soon. Notably, other gun rights organizations arerising in influence,many of which have long seen the NRA astoo compromising.LaPierre and the NRA are not entirely responsible for our country's growing sense of vulnerability in the wake of mass shootings, police shootings of unarmed Black men and the threat of domestic terrorism. But in shaping a new set of rights and responsibilities, in which where citizens are sold the idea that private gun ownership is generally essential to be prepared to combat potential threats (and that \"more guns means less crime\"), theyescalated the riskthat even more people will be silenced, fearful, injured andkilled.They moved usfartherfrom being able to look at the distribution of harm rather than the pathologization of \"bad actors.\" They moved us farther from being able toapproach the problemtogether.Opinion by Jennifer TuckerTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
