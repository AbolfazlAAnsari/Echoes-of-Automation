But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.COLORADO SUPREME COURT DISQUALIFIES TRUMP FROM 2024 BALLOTBy adopting this provision, the victorious Union obviously wanted to prevent former Confederates from returning to Congress, the executive branch, or the military (once the war had ended, some of the Southern states had elected former Confederate leaders to Congress).TheColorado Supreme Courthas clearly erred, however, in finding that this clause applied to former presidents. Section 3 lists that disqualification from future office will apply to anyone who had engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States who had been: a) \"a member of Congress\"; b) \"an officer of the United States\"; or c) a state official.  The constitutional text, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, carefully distinguishes between \"an officer of the United States\" – which covers cabinet officers and those below them – and the president of the United States.The examples where the Constitution distinguishes between the president and an \"Officer of the United States\" are legion.  You need look only at the text of Section 3 itself.  It bars insurrectionists from serving as \"elector of President and Vice-President.\"If the14th Amendment’s Framershad wanted to bar past presidents, who join an insurrection, from ever holding federal office again, they could have easily included \"President\" in the very same sentence. Or consider the Appointments Clause in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, which states that the President may nominate, and with the advice and consent of the Senate, may appoint \"Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States.\" Under this Clause, the president himself is distinguished from \"Officers of the United States.\"  Article II, which establishes the executive branch, specifies that the President is \"elected,\" not appointed, and gives the president the responsibility to \"Commission all the Officers of the United States.\"COLORADO KICKING TRUMP OFF BALLOT SHOWS DEMOCRATS WAKE UP EVERY MORNING ACTING LIKE IT'S JANUARY 6: CONWAYThis makes perfect sense. The Constitution ensures democratic choice of our highest leaders – the president and Congress – through election; these then appoint the lower-ranking \"Officers of the United States\" through nomination by the President and confirmation of the Senate.These same arguments show that the Constitution would not prohibit someone who committed insurrection and rebellion from election to the presidency in the future.  Section 3 bars rebels from becoming: a) \"Senator or Representative in Congress\"; b) and \"elector of President and Vice-President\"; or c) \"any office, civil or military, under the United States.\"Put aside whether Trump’s alleged involvement with the January 6 attacks or attempt to coerce Vice President Mike Pence to reject valid electoral votes amounted to an insurrection or rebellion.  Either way, Trump could still run for the presidency; Section 3 only prohibits him from being a Member of Congress, and Elector, or a cabinet or military officer.COLORADO NIXING TRUMP IN ‘STRIKINGLY UNDEMOCRATIC’ WAY UNITES EXPERTSEven the Constitution’s provisions for impeachment and removal of executive branch officers draws a line between presidents and \"officers of the United States.\"  Article II expressly provides that \"[t]he President, Vice Presidentand all civil Officers of the United States,shall be removed\" upon impeachment and Senate conviction.If the Colorado Supreme Court were correct, the Impeachment Clause contains an obvious redundancy: it should have just said that all Officers of the United States could be impeached and removed, and not repeated \"the President and Vice President.\"  But as the great Chief Justice John Marshall warned long ago in McCullough v. Maryland, we are not read any constitutional language as mere surplusage; we must give meaning to every word and clause.The Constitution even requires that \"officers of the United States\" and the president take different oaths of office: it is the latter alone who must specifically swear \"to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,\" while the former must swear only \"to support this Constitution.\"CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONWhen the constitutional text is this clear, there is no need for courts to delve into the history of the drafting or ratification of the text.  But the constitutional structure confirms the text.  Even if the United States were to face future presidents who might commit future insurrections, the Founders had already provided a mechanism that provides for their disqualification.The Constitution also leaves to Congress the duty to execute the Fourteenth Amendment, presumably by passing a law specifying who is subject to disqualification – which, asChief Justice Salmon Chaseobserved immediately after its ratification, Congress has not done.This is no apology for Trump’s spreading of baseless claims of electoral fraud or his efforts to stop the electoral count on January 6. But as with the weak charges brought by the special counsel, the effort to hold Trump accountable for his action should not depend on a warping of our constitutional system.Prosecutors should charge him with insurrection if they can prove it. Congress should disqualify Trump if it can agree that he committed the crime.The Supreme Court can step in to ensure that the American people will decide Trump’s responsibility for the events of January 6 at the ballot box in 2024’s nominating and general elections for president.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JOHN YOOJohn Yoo, co-author ofThe Politically Incorrect Guide to the Supreme Court, is a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
