The overwhelming majority of those polled (65 per cent) define socialism as the government providing more services while 57 per cent define it as government providing a guaranteed minimum income.The government providing more services is certainly consistent with the policies and aspirations of the federal government. The Trudeau government has increased transfers to the provinces(https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/federal-transfers/major-federal-transfers.html) to support health care, post-secondary education and social welfare. It has also introduced a new transfer to eligible families with children (the Canada Child Benefit(http://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/adjusting-for-the-canada-child-benefits-tax-free-status)) and created two new federal programs to collaborate with the provinces in supporting dental care(https://www.budget.canada.ca/2022/report-rapport/chap6-en.html#wb-cont) and daycare(https://www.budget.canada.ca/2022/report-rapport/chap4-en.html#2022-1), and it promises to introduce a new national pharmacare(https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/corporate/about-health-canada/public-engagement/external-advisory-bodies/implementation-national-pharmacare/final-report.html) program.Whether it's called socialism or not, higher government spending on new and expanded services - not to mention a guaranteed minimum income - requires higher taxes. But the data are clear: most Canadians don't want to pay higher taxes. According to the poll, which offered all respondents four tax options to help finance socialism, the two most popular options by far were a new wealth tax on the top one per cent, which got 72 per cent support, and an increase in personal income taxes for the top 10 per cent, which got 59 per cent support. The logic seems straightforward: most respondents assume these two taxes would not affect them. The other two tax options were far less popular. An across-the-board increase in personal income taxes garnered only 31 per cent support, while only 16 per cent of respondents supported a GST increase.In its eight years in power, the Trudeau government has already increased the top personal income tax rate(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/canadas-rising-personal-tax-rates-and-failing-tax-competitiveness-2020.pdf) from 29 to 33 per cent and has mused repeatedly about introducing a new wealth tax(https://www.thespec.com/opinion/contributors/2022/03/18/wealth-tax-necessary-to-address-income-inequality.html) and raising capital gains taxes(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/trudeau-government-should-kill-rumours-about-capital-gains-hike). As things stand, the top 20 per cent of families already pay a disproportionate share of the total tax burden(http://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/measuring-progressivity-in-canadas-tax-system-2022), earning 44.6 per cent of all income but paying 53.0 per cent of all taxes (federal, provincial and local).Terence Corcoran: Property rights? No way, man. This is Canada!(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-property-rights-no-way-man-this-is-canada)Matthew Lau: Workplace return should be elementary, my dear prime minister(https://financialpost.com/opinion/workplace-return-elementary-prime-minister)Opinion: Court gives universities a free pass to infringe privacy(https://financialpost.com/opinion/court-universities-infringe-privacy)The problem for Ottawa and the advocates of socialism is that because these targeted tax hikes don't raise enough revenue to cover the costs of new spending the money has to be borrowed, which raises government debt and slows economic growth. Since the current federal government came to power Canada's total national debt has increased from $1.1 trillion(https://www.budget.canada.ca/2016/docs/plan/anx1-en.html#_Toc446106876) to an estimated $1.9 trillion(https://www.budget.canada.ca/fes-eea/2022/report-rapport/anx1-en.html#wb-cont) this year.Canada is on an unsustainable fiscal path as governments, particularly the federal government, expand existing programs while adding new ones without being honest with Canadians about the ultimate need for broad-based tax increases to pay for them. The Trudeau solution from day one has been to borrow, which simply defers the tax bill to the future.And the bill is already starting to come due. Ottawa expects to spend $43.3 billion(https://www.budget.canada.ca/fes-eea/2022/report-rapport/anx1-en.html#wb-cont) next year solely on interest on the national debt. That's more than it spends on employment insurance, the Canada Child Benefit or the Canada Social Transfer, and almost as much as total health transfers to the provinces ($49.3 billion).The financial pressures from new spending, coupled with increasing debt and interest costs, will eventually force a decision on governments and Canadians more broadly. If we want larger government, we'll have to pay the price in the form of higher taxes. As Nobel laureate Milton Friedman often reminded us, there's no such thing as a free lunch, not even for advocates of socialism.Jason Clemens and Steven Globerman are economists at the Fraser Institute. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
