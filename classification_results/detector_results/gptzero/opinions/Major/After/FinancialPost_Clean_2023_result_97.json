To reverse these trends, governments must make a dramatic U-turn based on common sense and real-world evidence.Consider, for instance, one of the top issues worrying Canadians right now - housing affordability. Every politician from coast to coast pays lip service to the need to improve housing affordability. And yet some of the actions being taken not only will fail to increase affordability but will worsen it markedly.Repeated analyses(http://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/canadas-housing-mismatch.pdf) have shown that the main cause of Canada's affordability crisis is the lack of construction of new homes (including single- and semi-detached, row housing and apartments). Housing completions reached 219,942 in 2022(https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3410012601) but much more is needed just to catch up with existing demand.At the same time, the federal government has super-charged immigration(https://financialpost.com/opinion/jack-mintz-rapid-immigration-isnt-the-only-way-to-grow). Canada's population is expected to increase by more than 1.2 million people in 2023, largely through immigration. While immigration is a positive for the country, it needs to be assessed alongside other considerations.

Which raises a commonsense question: if this approach didn't work in Europe and the U.S., why implement the same policies in Canada and expect different results?Yet Ottawa has imposed formal and informal restrictions on the exploration, development and transportation of traditional, reliable sources of energy such as oil and gas while pouring massive subsidies into unreliable renewable energy sources, principally wind and solar.
