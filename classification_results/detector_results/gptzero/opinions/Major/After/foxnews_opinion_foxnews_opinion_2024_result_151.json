(Photo by RODRIGO ARANGUA/AFP via Getty Images)Good. It’s a sharp reminder to China that the U.S. Air Force still wields dominant air power and can put combat-seasoned F-22s on China’s doorstep in a matter of hours. No drone can send that message for you.Another big factor in the F-22 deployment is Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General C. Q. Brown, U.S. Air Force, who is a fighter pilot himself.  Earlier, Brown commanded thousands of missions during three years as the top airman and Deputy Commander of U.S. Central Command.  Brown knows the capabilities and weak spots of Iran thoroughly. Heck, Brown could fly intercept or strike missions himself.  As a younger officer, he was a top aerial warfare tactician and weapons school instructor flying the F-16 fighter plane.  Think Maverick’s bossin \"Top Gun.\"The political situation with Iran and their terror gangs may be a mess, but the U.S. military response is strong and cool-headed. The F-22s and the rest of the air and sea armada have a big task.  Iran’s attacks may be wider this time.On July 19, a Houthi drone launched from Yemen turned to come in over the sea and hitTel Avivwithout being intercepted. Attacks from multiple vectors will test the ability of the U.S., Israel and other regional allies to track and take out drones and missiles from Iran, Yemen and other spots.  U.S. forces in Syria, Iraq, the Red Sea, and other locations must be protected, too.Another successful defense against Iran’s barrage will boost the U.S. posture against China, too. Wargamers believe China’s strategy is to pelt U.S. bases, allies and ships with missiles if war breaks out. Showing that the F-22s can intercept drones and missiles in the Middle East goes a long way toward validating deterrence against China, too.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REBECCA GRANTDr. Rebecca Grant is vice president of the Lexington Institute."
