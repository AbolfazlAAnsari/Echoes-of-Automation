A Big Mac costs $7.49 these days, compared to $3.99 at the end of 2019 — an 88% increase. California recently raised its minimum wage at fast food restaurants to $20, which led to job losses and higher prices. A federal standard may not be far behind. Biden has offered little in the way of relief, instead standing with labor bosses in their effort to pass a regulation known as joint employer, a union giveaway that would cripple the franchise model altogether.Meanwhile, Biden’s Federal Trade Commission, led byChair Lina Khan, has blocked a proposed merger between Kroger and Albertsons that would lead to more access to groceries for more consumers.So at this point, facing all these obstacles, you could be forgiven for deciding to \"staycation.\" Not so fast. To deflect from unending inflation rates fueled by their spending spree, the Biden administration has taken aim at some of the country’s most successful delivery companies, again involving so-called \"junk fees.\"The Department of Labor (DOL) has tried to undermine their business model by eroding the independent contractor model that allows companies to utilize delivery drivers to make a few extra bucks on their own schedule. Meanwhile, the FTC has taken Amazon to court in another lawsuit that could lead to the end of the popular delivery company and the fast shipping and small business ecosystem it provides.Bidenomics has driven consumer sentiment to a six-month low, but we’ve persevered through tough times before and will again. Get out there and enjoy your summer, and remember that American innovation knows no bounds, despite the best efforts of the Biden administration.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SCOTT BROWNRepublican Scott Brown represented Massachusetts in the United States Senate from 2010-2013 and served as the United States Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa from 2017-2020.
