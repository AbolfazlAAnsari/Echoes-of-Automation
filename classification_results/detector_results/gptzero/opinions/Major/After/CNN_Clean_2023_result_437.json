Melatoninis linked toour 24-hour circadian rhythm. Natural melatonin productionoccurs in darkness and is suppressed by light. This makes melatonin pills useful forhelping the body acclimate to a different time zoneor for people who have circadian rhythms that don't line up with social norms, like extreme night owls who can't get up in time for work. However, it isnot recommendedas a sleep aid for insomnia.In the US,melatonin, like all dietary supplements, is largely unregulated, and it can have side effects.As CNN has reported, melatonin has been \"linked to headaches, dizziness, nausea, stomach cramps, drowsiness, confusion or disorientation, irritability and mildanxiety,depressionand tremors as well as abnormally low blood pressure.\" It can also have serious drug interactions that can lead to problems such as fever, muscle rigidity or seizures. This makes consulting a sleep specialist before taking melatonin all the more important.What's more, astudy published in April inJAMA found that some over-the-counter preparations contained higher levels of melatonin than the dose indicated on the label and many included cannabidiol (CBD). While this study focused on gummies, prior studies foundsimilar problems with melatonin pills.This is concerning because1-2 mg of melatonin or lessis all it takes to achieve normal levels of melatonin in the blood.On a recent trip to my local drug store to pick up a prescription, I was shocked to see that 1mg is labeled as a\"pediatric dose,\"while some \"adult doses,\"were labeled 3-5mgand sometimes even higher. Because of similar irregularities, several countries-including the United Kingdom, Japan and Australia-and the European Unionno longer allow melatonin to be sold as a dietary supplement and instead treat it as a prescription medication. This might be the right solution in the US as well, as it would force manufacturers to adhere to stringent rules about purity and dosing.In addition to regulating melatonin supplements, we need todispel the myththat melatonin is an effective sleep aid and instead spread awareness about a treatment that is proven to help with insomnia:cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia(CBT-I). While few have probably heard of this specialized therapy, it can be a game-changer for people with insomnia disorder. CBT-I involvessystematically targeting thoughts and behaviorsthat negatively impact sleep. It usually requires four to eight in-person or telemedicine sessions with a trained therapist, butonline programsalso exist. However, some insurance companiesdeny coverage for psychotherapy for insomniaeven though they cover similar treatments for depression and anxiety. To prioritize health while providing relief from insomnia, insurance companies must recognize the need for this therapy and cover it.Finally, we need to be honest with ourselves about how we live. We don't prioritize sleep as an essential aspect of health. We prioritize work and recreation at the expense of basic healthy sleep habits like having a regular schedule, avoiding technology in the bedroom and limiting caffeine and alcohol, and we fail to reach out for help when sleep problems start to impact our daily lives. There is no dietary supplement that can fix chronic struggles with insomnia, but there are steps that can be taken to help you get a good night's sleep-and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is a better option for most insomnia sufferers.Opinion by Jennifer MartinTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
