Today, four in 10 social care workers earn less thanthe real living wage.  Without addressing this, the sector will not be able to attract and retain the talent we so desperately need.The government must benchmark and fund minimum care worker pay at NHS band three. This will allow care and support workers to earn a wage aligned with their skills and responsibilities, and encourage amuch-needed pool of workersinto these vital careers.After over a decade of stagnation on social care funding, and as the next general election draws near, now is the time for bolder policies that get to the root of the issue.Rachael DodgsonChief executive of DimensionsMisleading government travel advice is damaging tourismThe tourism industry in Sri Lanka employed over 380,000 people last year and is anticipated to grow by 1.6 per cent each year until it reaches over 1 million by 2028. One in five people in Sri Lanka rely on income generated by tourism to the country.The island’s ancient temples, beaches, lush tropical scenery, and sheer variety of wildlife is extraordinary. There is perhaps no other country on Earth with such complex biodiversity and cultural riches per square mile.Yet the UK government is systematically undermining the travel industry there, by retaining outdated and overly harsh travel advice which deters British citizens from visiting.Neighbouring countries benefit from more generous advice despite having more instances of British nationals being exposed to danger.The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) says it has recently revised Sri Lanka guidance. But the changes are synthetic and inadequate as officials persist in drawing attention to protests and violent unrest which have long since ceased.In fact, the whole system of FCDO advice appears to be inconsistent with most of Europe and North America escaping serious warnings, despite incidents of rioting, political unrest, and violent crime.These anomalies serve not only to diminish one country’s tourist industry but to undermine confidence in FCDO advice as a whole.We are calling on ministers to reform the FCDO’s approach from the bottom up. A new approach should ensure there is consistency so tourist industries and travellers alike can place their trust in the advice once again.Signed by:Sam Clark -Experience Travel Group, Dr Matthew Offord MP -Chair of All Party Sri Lankan APPG, The Rt.
