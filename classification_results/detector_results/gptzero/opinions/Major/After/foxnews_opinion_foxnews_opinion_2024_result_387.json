It might have been the single largest number of Americans ever insulted at one time from a presidential debate stage.Trump’s best moment was when he pointed out that Biden \"doesn’t fire anyone.\" It's more or less true, as the polls clearly show that the border is a disaster andDHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkasis still in charge.National Security Director Jake Sullivan called the Middle East quieter than it had been \"in two decades,\" just eight days before the horrific Hamas attack of Oct. 7. He still has his job.Concerns about potential bias from CNN moderators Tapper and Dana Bash proved irrelevant, because not only the biggest, but honestly, the only takeaway from the debate was the woeful display put on by Biden.Just how bad was it? Only an hour in, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof took to X to post, \"I wish Biden would reflect on this debate performance and then announce his decision to withdraw from the race, throwing the choice of Democratic nominee to the convention.\"Or as Apollo Creed's cornerman put it in \"Rocky III,\" \"Throw in the damn towel.\"Yes, it is that serious. It is that dire.Watching the blank stares waft across Biden's face all night, Americans could be forgiven if they were deeply concerned that this is the man sitting in the Oval Office and the Situation Room.Not only did Biden prove on Thursday night how deeply irresponsible it would be to reelect him in November, he made millions of Americans wonder if he can serve for four more days, much less four more years.Now the ball is now in the court of the Democratic Party. It must do the country the needed service of removing Biden from the presidential ballot, if not the White House, itself.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID MARCUSDavid Marcus is a columnist living in West Virginia and the author of \"Charade: The COVID Lies That Crushed A Nation.\""
