            "inputText": "The ghosts of Canada past are all around us. They live along the canyons of the Fraser River where labourers blasted a railway through mountains. They haunt the corridors of the Parliament buildings in Ottawa, the ramparts of Fort York and the plains above Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump. It is my job as a popular historian to bring these ghosts back to life.By continually refreshing our past, popular history plays an important role in educating a country about itself. Lately, however, it seems Canadians would rather run from their past than learn about it. My view is the reason for this is that my favoured genre of popular history is in retreat.Popular history has three primary functions in our society. The first is to make history accessible to the common reader by telling lively and engaging stories about the people who preceded us. When I read a journal entry describing a sunset that made a traveler feel lonely or lost in a vast foreign landscape, I put it in. When I come across the description of what roasted skunk tasted like, that goes in, too. (According to mid-19th-century visitor James Carnegie, Earl of Southesk, it tastes like \"suckling-pig: very white, soft and fat.\") Popular history strives to breathe life back into old stories to attract new readers.Secondly, popular history places these interesting stories and people into their historical context so we can better understand them. The world of the past was a radically different place and the people who filled it had values, influences and technologies unlike those that guide our decisions today. At Confederation, for example, there were hardly any roads in Canada, and no electricity or telephones. Ontario was mostly rural, with poorly-educated farmers living on isolated homesteads; the prairies were the domain of largely nomadic Indigenous nations. Yet the people who opened up our country were often driven by the same ambition to push boundaries (and get rich!) as today's software developers and scientists.Making the facts of the past easily accessible and placing them in their proper context makes possible the genre's third, and arguably most important, role: the creation of a common body of knowledge that informs our collective identity. Previous generations of popular historians, including Pierre Berton and Peter C. Newman, celebrated the achievements and resilience of early Canadians, fostering a sense of national pride and unity. Sharing these stories widely allowed contemporary readers to see themselves in the actions of their forebears, even if these older versions of our history ignored some crucial aspects of the Canadian experience, such as the Indigenous perspective.But we are now losing our connection with the past. Our current national narrative holds that Canadian colonists were - universally - despicable, racist thieves who sought the extinction of Indigenous people and discriminated against vulnerable populations whenever they could. The outward result of this new, self-loathing narrative can be seen in the wave of name changes(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-metropolitan-university-one-year-name-change-1.6822726), statue removals(https://c2cjournal.ca/2021/07/how-to-cool-canadas-overheated-statue-removal-business/), museum purges(https://c2cjournal.ca/2022/06/torontos-fort-york-is-under-attack-again-this-time-its-an-inside-job/), \"decolonization\" initiatives(https://c2cjournal.ca/2022/10/plaque-removal-ottawas-naughty-list-puts-the-titans-of-canadian-history-on-trial/) and assorted other efforts to repudiate our past.These new narratives fail as actual history because they lack a grounding in fact. Popular history has become largely \"a-factual.\" One troubling example is the persistent muddying of the waters by the CBC(https://www.cbc.ca/radio/secretlifeofcanada/transcripts/transcript-secret-life-of-canada-season-2-ep-1-bay-blanket-1.5095648) over whether the Hudson's Bay Company deliberately distributed(https://www.cbc.ca/radio/unreserved/uncovering-the-complicated-history-of-blankets-in-indigenous-communities-1.5264926/the-complicated-history-of-the-hudson-s-bay-point-blanket-1.5272430) smallpox-infested blankets to Indigenous people. Airing both sides of this \"debate\" gives the false impression there's any evidence to support such a claim. There's not. In fact, the HBC relied on Indigenous people, and no business deliberately murders its customers and employees or their families. A more serious approach by the CBC would explain how the company often extended aid and credit to support Indigenous societies during epidemicsVilifying historical figures without considering the full spectrum of their actions and the context of their times is also a grave disservice. Pinning the blame on Sir John A. Macdonald for the entirety of Canada's Indian Residential Schools, for instance, ignores the fact he had died before they were massively expanded and placed under church authority. The same goes for the many other cast-offs of Canadian history: Catholic Bishop Vital Grandin(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-city-council-bishop-grandin-renaming-1.6788886), Quebec Confederation-era politician Hector-Louis Langevin(https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/in-deference-to-indigenous-peoples-trudeau-strips-langevin-block-name-from-pm-s-office/article_a7113d2e-947e-5c44-9067-35488de49ac5.html), Halifax founder Edward Cornwallis(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/the-true-history-of-cornwallis-shows-hes-more-a-victim-than-a-villain), Ontario educator Egerton Ryerson(https://theconversation.com/egerton-ryerson-racist-philosophy-of-residential-schools-also-shaped-public-education-143039) and on and on. All had their faults, as do today's leaders. But an honest review of the facts of their lives reveals none was so flawed as to deserve to be purged from public sight.This is not to say that history must remain static, or that the stories of our past can never be revised or revisited. So long as accuracy and facts remain the basis of these revisions, they enhance and expand our understanding of the past. But revisiting history requires balanced assessment, juxtaposing questionable actions against the good that was done in the past. This means viewing historical figures as complex individuals shaped by their times, just as we are by ours. Fabricating a one-dimensional version of history to align with contemporary ideologies not only constitutes historical malpractice, it's a disservice to the millions of Canadians who quietly lived their lives within the context of these bigger stories. And it leaves us without any collective understanding of our past, making us a rudderless society that knows no common ground and shares no common beliefs.Calgary's tone-deaf mayor stumbles again(https://financialpost.com/opinion/calgary-tone-deaf-mayor-jyoti-gondek-stumbles)Freeland's new hidden tax on everything and everyone(https://financialpost.com/opinion/chrystia-freeland-new-hidden-tax-everything-everyone)Competition law should benefit consumers, not corporations(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-competition-law-should-benefit-consumers-not-corporations)Canada has plenty to celebrate. And we should do so more often. We should also examine our mistakes in honest fashion in order to better grasp how and why they occurred and ensure they don't happen again. Popular history that distorts the actual evidence to produce a cadre of aged villains marked for censure and deletion won't make Canada a better place to live today. Just emptier.
