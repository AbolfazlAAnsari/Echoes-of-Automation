NIMBYs should be given less opportunity to interfere with other people’s private property rights.These changes will make itmore affordable to build housing, which will in turn lead to lower prices for the buyer or residential tenant.But that is the long-term solution. In the short term, local ordinances and state laws should be rewritten to ensure that illegal squatters are not treated the same as lawful tenants who have genuine disputes with their rental property’s homeowner.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONIn Florida,Gov. Ron DeSantisrecently signed a law to make it easier to remove squatters, and at the same time protect tenants in legitimate conflicts with homeowners.And in New York, the legislature responded to Andaloro’s case in Queens by passing legislation that explicitly excluded squatters from landlord/tenant law protections for tenants. New York recognized that squatters are trespassers. Other states and cities should do likewise.Property rights are the foundation of a stable society. When property is protected from the \"grasping hand\" of government or from theft, it encourages peaceful co-existence and leads to calculated risk-taking, which redounds to the benefit of the owner as well as society at large.Looking the other way as squatters take away property rights – or denying the problem exists – simply amounts to tacit encouragement of an effort to destabilize society.Squatting is a real problemthat calls for real solutions. Denying it exists is to deny reality.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MARK MILLERGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
