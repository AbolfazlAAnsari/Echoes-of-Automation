Speaking of Lula, he was the only leaderto speak at length about Russia's aggression in Ukraine- saying \"everyone suffers from the consequences of the war.\"What also set the summit apart from G7 and G20s was that the vast majority of prime real estate in the media center was given to smaller, non-English speaking outlets from the developing world. However, media access to leaders and delegates was also extremely limited - a practice more in line with authoritarian regimes.Host South Africa just manages to pull it offThat South Africa managed to pull off hosting the summit is an accomplishment in itself. Hosting dozens of heads of state is daunting enough - but taking place against a backdrop of chronic power outages (some traffic lights, or robots as they are called here, did not function most of the time), intermittent internet connectivity (mostly due tocable damagebetween the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon),crumbling infrastructureand a worryingcrime rate, was impressive.\"It's truly heartening to see that, despite the challenges we confront, we can still demonstrate our capacity to host world-class events,\" Nontsikelelo Mdlankomo, a Johannesburg artist, told me.Many people on the ground told me the number oneaccomplishment of hosting BRICS would be to bring an end to the chronic power outages,which have clobbered the country since 2008.Xi, whose visit also marked25 years of diplomatic relations between China and South Africa, threw Ramaphosa and the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party a lifeline with adonation of emergency power equipment worth 167 million rand ($8.9 million),plus a multi-million dollar grant for the power sector.Even though the BRICS Summit failed to make progress on such issues as a currency alternatives and opening up the Black Sea to Ukrainian grain exports - which many African countries depend on - a bloc that has the world's only two billion-plus population nations, three nuclear powers, and two oil-rich nations cannot be easily written off.Of course, unity and direct discourse are good - but not at the expense of tilting the world more toward authoritarianism.At the end of the day, the summit should be chronicled as a clear win for Xi, a stage for a virtual show of bravado from an increasingly isolated Putin and the flash of a warning light to US-led western democracies that the concerns of developing nations shouldn't be taken for granted.Opinion by Michael BociurkiwTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
