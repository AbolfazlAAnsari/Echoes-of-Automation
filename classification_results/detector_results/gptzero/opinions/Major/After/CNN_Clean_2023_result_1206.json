Slippery!\"\"Using human beings as pawns!\") and even shots below the belt. (DeSantis saidNewsom's in-laws had moved to Florida; Newsom offered the true but gratuitous slam that DeSantis was41 points behind Trumpin his home state.)Given how stiff DeSantis has been in the presidential primary debates, and even at some campaign events, he managed himself reasonably well, especially early on. He lost energy as Newsom revved up and got into areas more fertile for assailing DeSantis, like his sending migrants off to Martha's Vineyard, supporting an abortion ban at just six weeks and referencing Florida schools that removed books with LGTBQ themes.\"I don't like how you demean people,\"Newsom said, a line that obviously scored because DeSantis's grin got even more awkward than usual.DeSantis struck themes he knew would play well to the Fox audience, like high gas prices in California and whatbullies teachers unions are.Interestingly, DeSantis did not once dredge up his previous go-to word: \"woke.\" Less surprisingly, since it mirrors previous debates, DeSantis said nothing critical about the man who leads the GOP presidential polls.Newsom was full-throated in his defense of Biden, while DeSantis steadfastly gave the president failing grades and even took a full swing at another Hannity slo-pitch softball on whether Biden was in \"cognitive decline,\" saying that he was.One of the weirder aspects of the event was the emphasis on Newsom as the heir-in-waiting, as though Fox et al would like to elbow Biden out of the race in favor of this much younger, with-it, dynamic guy who was having no trouble fighting the two opponents on stage at once.That was the most obvious reason to declare Newsom the winner, for those keeping score at home. Far from damaging his future national prospects, he took great advantage of his underdog status. He faced a double dose of conservative rhetoric from Hannity and DeSantis and didn't flinch. Newsom no doubt expected just that, got his licks in and still proved he could be a \"contend-ah.\" (If he actually wants to be, which, he swore again, he doesn't. Really.)He was, in a word, slick.When DeSantis kept lobbing the charge atNewsom that he's slick, he meant to sound disdainful; truthfully, he sounded a little jealous.Perhaps the best thing about the debate - and every network thinking of hosting one should take note - was that it was accompanied by exactly zero applause, gasps, laughter or other electioneering from an audience. Nobody needs that stuff.So, was there a point?They might have been easy to miss, but I spied two of them: One was that actually confronting an opponent can make a candidate look and sound more confident and competent than cringing at the mention of his name.Two was how effective a surrogate could be in using energy and rope-a-dope skills in the debate ring. But for some watching at home from the reigning champ's corner, maybe too effective?Opinion by Bill CarterTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
