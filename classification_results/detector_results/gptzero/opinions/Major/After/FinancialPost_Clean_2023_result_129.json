Climate activists and nearly three dozen municipalities have joined the call.But as I show in a recent report(https://assets.nationbuilder.com/affordableenergy/pages/1719/attachments/original/1695735429/LFXReport_Sept252023.pdf?1695735429) for Canadians for Affordable Energy, phasing out gas would cost Ontario households thousands of dollars per year and tens of thousands of jobs while producing only modest additional emission reductions. The Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) should therefore be instructed to ignore the gas phaseout campaign and continue using and developing its gas-fired generating capacity.Power systems require two different types of generators: baseload and peaking. Baseload generators are built to provide steady cheap electricity 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. In Ontario we rely on emissions-free nuclear and hydro for this. They are inexpensive but relatively inflexible, which means they are not easy to turn on and off. Unfortunately, power demand does go on and off - both daily as our needs adjust and seasonally as weather affects our needs. This is why peaking power is also necessary: generators that can be called upon (\"dispatched\") to ramp up or down on a minute-by-minute basis. Currently only fossil fuel-powered generators are dispatchable on a large enough scale to serve the Ontario grid. The province shut down its coal-fired plants so that leaves gas generators.A third category of generator consists of intermittent renewable systems(https://financialpost.com/category/commodities/energy/renewables/) like wind and solar. We could actually do without them but for political reasons we use some of each. They're neither reliable (as baseload is) nor dispatchable (as peaking sources are). They generate intermittently, depending on the time of day and the vagaries of the weather.Our gas-fired power plants currently make up 28 per cent of installed capacity but provide only about nine per cent of our power, as they are idle most of the time. But that nine per cent is critical, coming online when neither baseload nor renewables are adequate to meet system demand. If we didn't have natural gas plants, then on hot summer days when the wind is absent and air conditioners are going full blast we would face blackouts. Similarly, the presence of a lot of wind capacity in Ontario requires us to keep gas plants running in the background because wind turbines are prone to unexpected drops in output, requiring immediate power generation from gas to fill the gap.Ontario's electricity sector is exceptionally clean. Annual air pollution emissions from power generation fell by 98 per cent between 2000 and 2020. The electricity sector nowadays has virtually no effect on Ontario's air quality. As for greenhouse gases, the sector only contributes about two per cent of Ontario's emissions (because CO2 is a by-product of gas-fired generation), which translates into 0.008 per cent of global emissions, far too small to have any effect on the global climate.In 2021 the IESO issued a report examining possible ways to phase out natural gas. They studied a plan based on a mix of increased hydro imports from Quebec, a new small modular nuclear reactor, new battery storage systems and aggressive conservation measures. They concluded that the plan: depended on technologies not currently available; would increase power prices by 60 per cent; and, because none of the replacements are fully dispatchable, would give rise to significant risk of blackouts.Using a Canadian macroeconomic model, I simulated what would happen if the IESO plan were implemented. I looked at several scenarios, including one in which Quebec is unable to commit to the new exports and Ontario needs to procure supply elsewhere. Under reasonable assumptions, by 2030 the plan would cut Ontario's GDP by about three per cent and would cost between 17,000 and 25,000 jobs. The IESO estimated its plan would cost about $1,200 per household - though that only includes the direct costs. My model yielded a slightly lower direct cost per household but if you add in the indirect costs from lost income and higher consumer prices, the costs per household are about $3,000 a year.Chrystia Freeland spins the job numbers(https://financialpost.com/opinion/chrystia-freeland-spins-job-numbers)Canada will soon be alone and ignored in its climate obsession(https://financialpost.com/opinion/canada-alone-ignored-climate-obsession)Charities are struggling and Ottawa wants to tax donations more(https://financialpost.com/opinion/charities-struggling-ottawa-tax-donations-more)The plan would cut Ontario's greenhouse gas emissions by about three per cent but at a Canada-wide cost of at least $6,000 per tonne, making it a very inefficient part of our climate policy.Campaigns to promote a gas phaseout prey upon widespread misunderstanding of how our electrical system works and how clean it already is. Town councils and activists who enjoy green virtue-signalling need to realize that their scheme would cost a lot and destabilize Ontario's electricity supply while doing virtually nothing to help the environment. Ontario's government needs to respond to the phaseout campaign with a firm \"No!\"Financial PostRoss McKitrick, professor of economics at the University of Guelph, is author of Costs and Benefits of Phasing out Gas in Ontario's Electricity Sector for Canadians for Affordable Energy(https://assets.nationbuilder.com/affordableenergy/pages/1719/attachments/original/1695735429/LFXReport_Sept252023.pdf?1695735429) at affordableenergy.ca.(https://www.affordableenergy.ca/ )Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the business news you need to know - add financialpost.com(https://financialpost.com/ ) to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here(https://financialpost.com/newsletters/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
