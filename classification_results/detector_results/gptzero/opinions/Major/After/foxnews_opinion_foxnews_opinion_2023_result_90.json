Unfortunately, these new systems were committed too late and won’t arrive for many months, missing the start of the Russian offensive.For Ukraine’s offensive to reach its full potential, which will likely begin in the spring, they still need more air defense systems, longer-range artillery, armor, armed drones, fighter jets and most urgently, Ukraine needs the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which can hit critical Russian targets currently out of range. These targets include the military bases, fuel and ammunition depots and staging areas for Iranian drones in Crimea.Unfortunately, theBiden administration has consistently beena step behind throughout this war. They have repeatedly claimed sending certain advanced weapon systems – from Stingers, to HIMARS, to Patriot air defense systems, to Western main battle tanks – would somehow provoke Putin. Yet, when these provisions were eventually sent, months later, there was no Russian retribution.We commend the United Kingdom for their generous support. They were the first to provide Western battle tanks to Ukraine, helping unlock German approval for the Leopard 2 tanks along with the U.S. decision to send the Abrams.Additionally, the U.S. and allies should join the British in training Ukrainian pilots on NATO-standard fighter jets. Moreover, if smaller countries like the Baltics and Poland can provide such outsized support to Ukraine, larger ones have no excuse not to.This is not only the morally right thing to do; it’s in the U.S. national security interest. With just over $30 billion just in U.S. security assistance, which is about 3% of the U.S. defense budget, Ukraine has crippled the military of America’s second-greatest adversary without placing a single U.S. servicemember in harm’s way.Meanwhile, Congress will continue to conduct stringent oversight of U.S. funding to Ukraine, so the American people can rest assured their generous support is being used as intended in Ukraine.The administration has recently committed to provide M1 Abrams tanks, as well as longer range Ground Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB) – this is encouraging. Unfortunately, these new systems were committed too late and won’t arrive for many months, missing the start of the Russian offensive.Russia believes this will be a long, protracted war, which is in their interest. They have three times the personnel. And they mistakenly believe America and Europe will lose their political will to continue to support Ukraine. We cannot allow this to happen.Putin’s revisionist agenda does not stop at the Ukrainian border. If his dream of restoring the Soviet Empire turned its sights on a NATO ally next, then American boots on the ground would be required.There is also a clear long-term, national security interest in destroying the Russian military now to prevent that scenario. And a Russian victory will only embolden China’s Chairman Xi to threaten the Indo-Pacific, to include Taiwan, and play into his propaganda that the West is in decline.The administration was right to publicly warn the CCP against supplying Russia with arms and ammunition. If that occurs, it cannot be ignored. And that information must be declassified.We must continue, and continue to enhance, our support. President Joe Biden has said we will support Ukraine \"for as long as it takes.\" It doesn’t have to take that long. The delivery of the necessary weapon systems Ukraine needs will be essential to achieving victory as soon as possible, and it will be critical to the success of Ukraine’s future as an independent democracy.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP.
