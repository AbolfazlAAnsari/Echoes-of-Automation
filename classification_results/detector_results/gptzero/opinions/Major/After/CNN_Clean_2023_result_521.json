It has opened up greater opportunities in our society while helping drivegreater workplace success. And yet, 20 years after I started working in the diversity field, there can be no doubt that thefuture of DEI programs is in peril.We witnessed another sign of the backlash against the racial reckoning with the dismal Supreme Court ruling last monthforbidding the use of affirmative actionin college admissions. The court jettisoned decades of precedent in itsStudents for Fair Admissions vs. Harvardruling on affirmative action, and as a result, race can no longer be considered when determining which qualified applicants to admit.But the fallout from that ruling goes far beyond colleges. Those of us who are advocates for greater inclusion are now waiting for the other shoe to drop, aware that initiatives that champion diversity or racial equitycould be in even greater jeopardy.We saw an example of this earlier this month when a group of conservativeattorneys generaldemanded that large companies abandon race-based quotas and preferences in hiring, promotion and contracting - and they threatened legal action if the companies failed to comply.Ina letter addressed to \"Fortune 100 CEOs,\" the attorneys general wrote that \"companies that engage in racial discrimination should and will face serious legal consequences.\" Of course, it's laughable to assert that racially conscious remedies such as DEI programs amount to racial discrimination. Race was used for decades to keep people of color out of the corridors of power; remedying that problem requires that race be a central consideration.It's imperative that people of color and those who value diverse workspaces vigorously push back against efforts to turn back the clock. Now we may need to engage in a bit of strong-arming of our own, and we need to be every bit as organized as the groups striving to erase decades of racial progress.It's important to make clear to corporate leaders, including our captains of industry, that after pledging to commit millions of dollars to diversity efforts when they felt public pressure in the aftermath ofGeorge Floyd's murderthree years ago it is simply inexcusable toabandon those commitments now. We musthold them to their word. We shouldn't allow them to get away with anything less.I know firsthand that these vitally important efforts can be challenging and uncomfortable to put into place. It was always tough work to open eyes and hearts and change people's perspectives - and it's harder than ever now as conservatives rally their forces to oppose racial progress.My admonition to corporate leaders is, grow a backbone and push back against these conservative threats. There is a big difference between doing the important day-to-day, year-in, year-out work of diversity and true inclusion, instead of just using it to score PR points when these causes are fashionable.It is a fiction to assert that unqualified Blacks or other racial minorities have somehow been admitted to colleges over qualified White students. It is just as much a myth that Whites in corporate America suffer adverse impact when robust and grounded diversity programs are in place. These programs actuallyhelp create workplaces that are more functional and more productive.They seek out the best candidates for the jobs they seek to fill and then focus on fostering emotional intelligence development and wellness - all in accordance with the obvious goals of bolstering the company's bottom line and helping give the best possible shine to its brand.If diversity efforts are allowed to die, we will lose the progress that it took us the past half-century to achieve. Our corporate and academic leaders must stand up and move us ahead toward a truly egalitarian and opportunity-based society.Many Americans seem to have forgotten how the most recent push to create a more just America began:The worldwide protests during the summer of 2020offered us important lessons about honoring human dignity and the deep connections shared by all of humanity.Those lessons were profound and unforgettable. We need to fight to honor them. Diversity, equity and inclusion is all about not just having a multiplicity of genders or skin colors. It's about encouraging a diversity of thought, talent and creativity. And that's something from which every workplace and every classroom can benefit.Opinion by Sophia A.
