The Pentagon now says that Moscow has already recovered from their previous losses, with their overall force now 15% larger than when the invasion began.Which takes us to the second reason why 90% of Europeans think the war is lost: the West’s war machine can’t keep up.As one of Kiev’s top military officers told Politico recently, Ukraine can’t possibly produce what they need for the battlefield and neither can the U.S. nor Europe. In fact, there’s no magic weapon that’ll solve Ukraine’s lack of manpower — that’s the foundational problem.Nevertheless, Russia’s war machine continues churn out a shocking amount of war materiel, either on their own or with the help of China. To the point, the Pentagon assesses that they’ve re-stocked all of their previously destroyed tanks.In other words, Russian President Vladimir Putin has managed to weather the sanctions storm — and then some.Which takes us to the third and final reason for why only 10% of Europeans think Ukraine can win: bad leadership.Unfortunately for the West and their propaganda efforts, the Russian people largely view this war as one where NATO forces are the aggressors — and they mostly support Putin’s plan to stop them.There is some polling and anecdotal stories that suggest that there’s a small amount of internal discontent. But, for the most part, Russians are all-in — and feeling confident.A firefighter stands amongst debris in Kyiv, Ukraine following a Russian missile attack occurring at the early hours of Thursday, March 21, 2024.

As a Zelenskyy aid told Time Magazine back in November, whatever anti-corruption efforts are in place in Ukraine, they’re not working.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\"People [in the government and military] are stealing like there’s no tomorrow.\"Next, Zelenskyy himself is under fire for being disconnected from the true state of his military and, critics say, his heavy-handed leadership.Taken together, perhaps that’s why an increasing number of Ukrainians think the war is lost as well.A poll back in November showed that 42% of Ukrainians said they were willing to negotiate a peace with the Russians to end to the war.That number is up from just 29% in January 2023.Unfortunately for the West and their propaganda efforts, the Russian people largely view this war as one where NATO forces are the aggressors — and they mostly support Putin’s plan to stop them.And, frankly, the 42% are right. The outlines for a deal are still on the table; they were being negotiated back in April 2022 before Western powers scuttled them to advance President Joe Biden’s stated goal of regime change in Moscow.But that goal is now outlandishly out of reach (and utterly reckless regardless). Instead, the world’s focus should be on peace, not advancinganother $60 billion in war aidthat even Ukrainian generals say won’t save them.That’s the blunt reality that 90% of Europeans understand, even if America’s Hollywood stars and D.C. politicians do not.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM BRYAN DEAN WRIGHTBryan Dean Wright is a former CIA officer and member of the Democratic Party who resides in Oregon.
