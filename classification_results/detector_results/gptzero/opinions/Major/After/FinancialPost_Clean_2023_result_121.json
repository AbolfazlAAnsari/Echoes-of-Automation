Top-down planning by politicians and bureaucrats has replaced entrepreneurship, business investment and economic dynamism as the drivers of our economy. More taxes and borrowing, more government spending and more regulations are the solutions to everything in the Trudeau government's world. And this approach, which harkens back to the 1970s, has made most problems worse and helped produce a stagnating economy.The magnitude of the increase in government since Trudeau's election is stark. Federal spending (excluding interest payments) has increased from $256.2 billion(https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/services/publications/fiscal-reference-tables/2022/part-1.html#tbl1) in 2014-15 to an estimated $453.0 billion(https://www.budget.canada.ca/2023/report-rapport/anx1-en.html#a1) this year (2023-24). Total federal debt is expected to surpass $1.9 trillion, with interest payments reaching an estimated $43.9 billion this year, which is almost as much as Ottawa provides to the provinces for health care ($49.4 billion).Now, in the latest example of Trudeau's \"more government\" approach, the government has threatened(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-ottawa-introducing-changes-to-competition-act-summoning-grocery/) to impose a new tax on grocery chains(https://youtu.be/Gg0JWZLePII?si=wynO8lAmX-EAkXRe) if food prices are not stabilized. As is so often the case, this government seems more interested in appearing to solve problems rather than actually doing the difficult work of solving them.The underlying premise of Trudeau's threat is that grocery chains are enjoying unprecedented profits at the expense of Canadians. There's no doubt that food prices have increased dramatically and remain a main driver of the country's inflation problem. However, Trudeau's threat flies in the face of a number of careful analyses(https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/62f0014m/62f0014m2022014-eng.htm), including one by Statistics Canada in the fall of 2022 that found(https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/62f0014m/62f0014m2022014-eng.htm) food price increases are the result of bottlenecks in the supply chain (linked with the economy-wide shutdown during COVID), poor weather conditions in certain agricultural regions, higher fuel and fertilizer prices, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and higher operating costs for retailers. Notice what was absent in the analysis: grocery store profiteering.This finding generally aligned with the testimony of grocery store CEOs(https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/grocery-ceos-deny-accusations-that-food-price-inflation-is-driven-by-profit-mongering) to a Parliamentary hearing in March when they explained that their margins (i.e., rates of profit) had remained fairly stable but the volume of their business had increased. This conclusion was buttressed by a recent report(https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/san2023-8.pdf) by the Bank of Canada, which also investigated potential sources of the country's current inflation using a sample of firms including big-box retailers.
