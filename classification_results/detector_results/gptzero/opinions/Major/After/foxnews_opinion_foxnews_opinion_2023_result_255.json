Then the Biden administration and congressional Democrats doubled down by giving the organization a $280 million taxpayer-funded windfall, on top of the millions of dollars we provide to the organization each year.As if this wasn’t enough, the Biden administration is now supporting the creation of a new international agreement that will fork over even more power and legitimacy to globalist WHO bureaucrats in Geneva. Officially tabbed as the \"WHO Convention, Agreement, or Other International Instrument on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response\" or \"WHO CA+\" this \"zero draft\" of the proposed agreement, set for final consideration in 2024, would further empower the WHO by granting it more power to craft worldwide \"public health\" policy.Specifically, this accord would recognize WHO as the central authority on \"international health work\" and give it the power to commit signing nations to squash free speech by tackling so-called misinformation through the \"promotion of international cooperation.\" Further, the WHO Director would have the power to \"declare a public health emergency\" and be tasked with implementing \"health equity,\" which effectively means further hamstringing the American peoples quality of and access to care to satisfy the WHO’s woke, global agenda — all on the taxpayer dime.The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains monkeypox's status a global health emergency.(REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo)Enough. This nation was founded by defying the will of an unaccountable foreign power. President Biden and his handlers prefer to resubmit the American people to serve the international elite. Congress must not let them.One of the first bills Iintroduced this Congresswould defund the WHO. H.R. 343, the \"No Taxpayer Funding for the World Health Organization Act\" would prohibit the United States from providing any contributions to this corrupt organization.Further, simply defunding the WHO is not enough. Congress must ensure that the public health bureaucrats here at home – from Anthony Fauci, to Rochelle Walensky, to Francis Collins – who shredded the Constitution and subjected the American people to years of tyranny be held accountable too. We can do this through hearings, reforms, and overhauls of their bloated agencies through the appropriations process.It ought to be a simple rule of thumb that we don’t give money to organizations that lie and undermine our interests. The WHO completely failed at the very thing it was designed to do while bolstering the biggest foreign threat to our national security in the process. It will never hold itself accountable; that job belongs to the American people and those elected to serve them.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP. CHIP ROY"
