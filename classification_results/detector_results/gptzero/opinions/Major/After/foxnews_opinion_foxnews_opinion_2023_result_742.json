Military ReadinessThough Kennedy’s uncle, President John F. Kennedy, was a proponent of a strong military, today’s Democrats see military spending as the only part of the federal budget they’re willing to cut.Even as theBiden administrationflirts with nuclear war in Ukraine and ignores a well-telegraphed takeover of Taiwan by China, military readiness is on the back burner.4. Public SafetyWhat about those Democratic voters who live in dangerous communities and support public safety? Their party has abandoned them on that issue as well.As Democrats fight tocut funding for police, elect prosecutors who won’t prosecute, and do away with cash bail, they leave vulnerable those who live in the bluest areas – their own voting blocs.5. Fiscal SanityFinally, the ‘Blue Dog’ Democrats who believed in balanced budgets went from being an endangered species to being extinct.  Spending restraint was never pristine in either party, but progressives don’t even pretend to take it seriously.I don’t know the number of Democrats who still support free speech, due process,military readiness, public safety, or fiscal restraint, but I believe there are enough of them to swing an election.Whether they abandon their party, reject their frontrunners, refuse to participate, or vote Republican as \"Reagan Democrats\" did in 1980 and 1984, they can have an outsized influence on America’s future.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JASON CHAFFETZJason Chaffetz is a FOX News (FNC) contributor and the host of theJason In The Housepodcast on FOX News Radio.
