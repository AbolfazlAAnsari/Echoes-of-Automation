Lucky for him, he recovered. And lucky for the brain eating worm that he didn't pick Joe instead, or he would have starved to death. But this whole worm in your brain thing got me thinking that there's no shortage of parasites out there living off the brains of others.The most obvious are the campus occupiers who have segued intoruining college graduation ceremoniesacross America. The worm in these heads of these kids sounds like a cross between Karl Marx and someone with even worse hair, Joy Reid. Which explains the united front among communists, anarchists, BLM, Antifa and the Hamas-holes. Also climate change hoaxers. Yep, we've seen Greta's new gig now, since the globe didn't burn up like she said. So how will she get her screen time?COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY STUDENT IN HANDCUFFS RIPS UP DIPLOMA ON COMMENCEMENT STAGE IN ACT OF PROTESTBut their common denominator is clear: We want to destroy the West and what we're going to offer you instead is far worse. To them, it's like replacing Jon Hamm with a ham. Here is video of Queers for Palestine, who have as much in common with Hamas as Kat does with members of Odor Eaters Anonymous, but the Queers for Palestine do have one thing in common with Hamas, irrational hate. They tried tostop traffic at Walt Disney Worldin Florida.VIDEOBut they can't think they got a worm. Thankfully, Florida turned these Queers for Palestine into inmates for Palestine in minutes. Turns out you can arrest people blocking the road quickly if you arrest people for blocking the road quickly. And if these Queers for Palestine think that's bad, imagine what would happen if they ever met Hamas. Hamas loves to party with the LGBTQ community. First, they'll raise the roof. Then they throw them off it, but that's actual enforcement. Oh. Thank you. But that's actual enforcement without contemplating root causes.UNC CHAPEL HILL BOARD VOTES TO DISMANTLE DEI PROGRAMS, USE FUNDS ON CAMPUS POLICE AFTER ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTSShouldn't civilization now be collapsing like Jerrold Nadler during a stress test? Up next, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, whose country is pushing the online harms bill, which criminalizes what they call hate speech. What is hate speech in Canada, you ask? It's any speech that might make a protected group uncomfortable. If that net got any wider, it could catch Whoopi Goldberg's lunch.So, is this law retroactive? What if you tweeted problematic stuff that's still out there? What if you once shared a controversial video? Or what if you have an embarrassingly racist photo lying around and you happen to be prime minister of Canada? The law is vague, but what's scary is that if you are likely to re-offend, you could be locked up indefinitely going forward. All thanks to Trudeau, he is rapidly becoming our hemisphere's Kim Jong Un.Turns out the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, if your mom bangs Castro. And what if, as an American, you mocked or criticized a Canadian? Could you be extradited to Canada to face charges? Well, let's try it out on three, we're going to say: Hey Justin, you suck. One. Two. Three. Hey Justin, you suck! Congrats, everyone. You are now safer vacationing in Mexico. But think about it, could you go to jail in Canada for sharing a video about a certainCanadian shop teacher?
