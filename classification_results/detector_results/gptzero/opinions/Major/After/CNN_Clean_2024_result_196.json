Any narrative that portrays undocumented immigrants generally as violent criminals is harmful and inaccurate.Riley'ssuspected killer, Jose Antonio Ibarra, is so far, just that - a suspect. While he faces felony murder, false imprisonment and other charges, he is still entitled to the presumption of innocence. This is the cornerstone of our criminal justice system. Under our Constitution, Ibarra is entitled to due process as well, like any other person on US soil.The Supreme Court has extended such protectionsspecifically to undocumented peoplebased on the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Any rush to judgement regarding Ibarra is trampling on these principles.Early reportingon Ibarra has found that he was arrested in 2022 after entering the US illegally and then released. He was later arrested by New York City police and charged \"with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation,\" according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and again released. But these facts, along with the circumstances of Riley's killing, do not mean that Ibarra should become the poster boy for undocumented migrants.Studyafterstudyhasfound no conclusive linkbetween immigrants and crime. In 2023Stanford University researchersfound that such a connection was \"mythical\" and unsupported by 140 years of data.A 2020Princeton University studyfound that undocumented immigrants in Texas tended to have fewer felony arrests than legal residents. In New York City, which has seen the arrival of 170,000 unauthorized migrants since Texas Gov. Greg Abbott began busing them to the city in April 2022, there hasbeen no surge in crimein that period.Besides, there are an estimated 10.5 millionundocumented peoplein the US, and it is myopic to focus on only the worst elements among them. The ranks of our undocumented population have included aWall Street executive, aPulitzer Prize-winning journalist,military veterans, andHarvard graduates.Undocumented people servedas front-line workersduring the pandemic and some have helped rescue childrenfrom a kidnapper. Reducing all unauthorized migrants to the stereotype of a violent killer ignores the genuine contributions that they have made to this country.Typical of the conservative response to Riley's killing has been South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, whoin a post on X, formerly Twitter, said: \"Nations like Venezuela are emptying their prisons of dangerous criminals to send them to America... The tragic murder in Georgia proves that Biden's border policies are putting our kids in danger.\"Sadly, many Americans believe this kind of inflammatory rhetoric. APew Research surveythis month found that, despite evidence to the contrary, 57% of Americans believe that large numbers of people seeking to enter the country leads to more crime.This twisted narrative is dangerous. Consider that Latino student groups at UGA say they have alreadyreceived\"hate comments\" although they had nothing to do with Riley's killing and the suspect was not a student. Or that the Guardian Angels, a vigilante group in New York City, recentlyassaulted a manin the middle of a Fox News broadcast. The man was incorrectly identified as a \"migrant\" and is a New Yorker from The Bronx.Even a much-publicized altercation between New York City police and seven migrants in Times Square has turned out to beless clear cutthan originally thought; theNew York Times reportsthat the police \"initiated the encounter.\"Whoever is found guilty of killing Riley deserves to be punished to the full extent of the law. Until then, it is the height of cynicism for Republicans to use her death to score political points.House Speaker Mike Johnsonsaid in a post on social media Saturdaythat President Joe Biden needs to \"close the border\" in light of Riley's death. Yet, in early February, CongressionalRepublicans blockeda potential bipartisan immigration deal thatwould have giventhe president authority, under certain circumstances, to do just that.If the suspect is found guilty, the anger surrounding the Riley case should be directed at lawmakers who have repeatedly failed to overhaul our immigration system, creating a dysfunctional status quo that may have allowed a dangerous individual to be paroled into the country.There are no partisan \"sides\" in the grisly killing of a beloved, innocent young person. Laken Riley deserves justice - not to be exploited as a symbol of xenophobia or hate.Opinion by Raul A. ReyesTM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
