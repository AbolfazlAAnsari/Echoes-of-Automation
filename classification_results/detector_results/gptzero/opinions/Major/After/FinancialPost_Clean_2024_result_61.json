Set to expire at the end of 2023, that policy was extended to April 30th.When allowable work hours were extended in 2022, then-Immigration Minister Sean Fraser justified the move(https://www.cicnews.com/2022/10/breaking-canada-to-allow-international-students-to-work-off-campus-over-20-hours-per-week-1031301.html#gs.68bcsa) as alleviating domestic labour shortages. And in a startlingly honest moment(https://breachmedia.ca/canadas-open-secret-international-students-used-cheap-labour/ ) last November, his successor, Marc Miller, defended high international student numbers by explaining that \"industry and low-skilled labour\" are \"looking for cheap labour.\"Applicants increasingly see a study permit as a springboard to permanent residency in Canada. According to a 2021 survey(https://cbie.ca/infographic/#:~:text=60%25%20of%20international%20students%20plan%20to%20apply%20for%20permanent%20residence%20in%20Canada), 60 per cent of international students intend to apply for permanent residence in Canada - a strategy made much easier by the Trudeau government's 2016 restoration of the rule, scrapped by the Harper government, that time spent on a study permit can count toward the physical residency requirement for permanent residency.But now, after eight years of dramatic increases, the Trudeau government is finally capping(https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/miller-cap-international-students-1.7090779) international student numbers - though so far only for two years. In 2024, 360,000 undergraduate study permits will be approved, 35 per cent fewer than in 2023, while the number for 2025 will be determined at the end of this year. Each province and territory is getting a cap based on its population, which Ottawa hopes will spur provincial crackdowns on diploma mills(https://macleans.ca/longforms/fraud-canada-education-international-students/).Though certainly an improvement, a temporary cap does not address the underlying problems with the international student program. Its numbers did not soar to 900,000 because of the world's sudden affection for double-doubles or snow drifts. What brings people here in such numbers is the opportunity to work and obtain permanent residency.We need to reverse the Trudeau government's shift of the international student program's focus toward employment and citizenship. A complete prohibition on working off-campus would remove the employment attraction entirely and set a clear precedent for future governments that the international student program is not merely a supplementary foreign worker program. It would also send a clear message to prospective applicants: the student program is an educational vehicle, not a backdoor to immigration. No longer allowing time spent as a foreign student to count towards citizenship would remove the second big non-academic attraction.But doesn't Canada benefit when skilled foreign graduates becoming citizens? If they can find places to live, yes, almost certainly. But their home countries probably need their educated selves far more. Contributing to the Global South's brain drain(https://wol.iza.org/uploads/articles/31/pdfs/brain-drain-from-developing-countries.pdf) hardly fits with Canada's humanitarian aspirations.If reforms along these lines were enacted, we would be left with a smaller number of international students, each more eager to contribute to cultural exchange in Canadian universities, study hard and then return home with fond associations for this country, as well as the expertise needed to build up their home countries.With political will, a program that has become a backdoor to immigration could become a worthy educational vehicle once more.Financial PostRiley Donovan is a B.C. journalist and columnist.Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the business news you need to know - add financialpost.com(https://financialpost.com/ ) to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here(https://financialpost.com/newsletters/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2024 Postmedia Network Inc.
