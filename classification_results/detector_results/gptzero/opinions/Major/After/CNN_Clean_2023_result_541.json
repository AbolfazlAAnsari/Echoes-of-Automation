And it is followed by Nauta and the new co-defendant, De Oliveira, observing and pointing out the surveillance cameras, and then De Oliveria having a conversation about \"the boss\" wanting the IT server deleted. (Nauta and De Oliveira's attorneysdeclined to commentto CNN.) Lest we miss the point, all of that is framed on either end of this new insert to the indictment with alleged calls from Trump to his new co-conspirator De Oliveira.If the facts bear out as charged, this is slam dunk legal proof that also has a strong human dimension. Like the unflattering nature of the Bedminster tape and the Fox News appearance, a former president allegedly dragging two of his workers into a criminal scheme is an extremely unsympathetic look.In truth, it's not just that each of these charges strengthens the indictment, it's also about the strength of the crossover effect. The newly persuasive details in each charge will add heft to the other charges. And in criminal trials, a rising tide lifts all boats.That matters more here than it might in other jurisdictions. Smith likely will not have the easiest path ahead with Cannon, whohas shown a propensityin the past to rule in the former president's favor. More challenging still, the case will be tried before a jury inFort Pierce, Florida. The jury pool will be drawn from areas which likely include manyTrump supporters, who may or may not be able to assess the facts objectively.And, then, of course there is the issue of a potential further trial delay. The complications stemming from the new defendant, new facts and new charges may well push back the current May 2024 trial date. Still, even if the judge relaxes the schedule, there remains some runway to begin the trial before the Republican National Convention next July and certainly before the general election in November 2024.Trump will likely fight that, renewing hisoriginal wishto push the trial to after the election. But even if that happens, Smith has another card to play.Trumpannounced last weekthat he is a target in Smith's January 6 investigation in Washington, DC, which many see as a precursor to Smith ultimately charging him. If Trump is charged in the January 6 case, this allows Smith to try to get this DC case to trial in 2024. He may be able to argue to the DC court that the exact timing of the Florida documents case is now uncertain, and that the January 6 case should be on a parallel or even faster track, in case the Florida case does not happen in May.While the success of that argument will depend on the judge Smith draws, the Washington, DC, federal judges (not to mention juries) are viewed asgenerally favorableto the special counsel's case.Finally, putting all of those legal questions to the side, the updated indictment tells us something important about the politics of all of this - namely that Smith doesn't give a damn about them. For him to drop these new charges on a day when the political and media worlds were onthe edge of their seatin the January 6 case shows that he's put on blinders, charging straight ahead and doing his job as a prosecutor, irrespective of those external considerations.That's as it should be. His job is not to worry about the press, politics or the public (apart from his eventual juries). A more political prosecutor might have waited until after the dust cleared from the January 6 case to supersede, or not have done it at all - especially not in a week already marked bycontroversyover the federal prosecution of Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden's son.Smith is putting all that to the side - and remaining committed to, above all else, presenting the most powerful prosecution that he can to a jury. The updated indictment enhances the power of his case.Smith has taken a strong hand and made it even better.Opinion by Norman EisenTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
