            "inputText": "Of the many problems that face young Canadians, the cost of housing is perhaps the worst. This is especially so in British Columbia, which has some of the country's most expensive housing markets, and where the problems associated with homelessness are especially acute.The provincial government wants to do something about it, which is commendable, but that's no excuse for following the politician's syllogism: \"something must be done; this is something; therefore, this must be done.\"The problem is illustrated by proposed legislation that effectively stops(https://globalnews.ca/news/9633067/arbutus-social-housing-legislation-court-challenge/) a court challenge to a low-income housing project on Arbutus Street in Vancouver.The Kitsilano Coalition, a group of local NIMBYs, are worried(https://rock101.com/news/9633067/arbutus-social-housing-legislation-court-challenge/) that the 13-storey, 129-unit development would \"import the culture of the street\" into the area, is too close to a school and will concentrate too many people with complex issues in the Kitsilano neighbourhood.Vancouver city council held public hearings prior to approving the project, but the coalition filed a court challenge alleging that the consultations did not meet certain procedural requirements.The provincial government has had enough. But its response was unusual. It tabled a bill that applies only to this specific project, at this specific time and stipulates that(https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/bills/billscurrent/4th42nd:gov26-1) \"despite any decision of a court to the contrary ... the public hearing ... is conclusively deemed to have been validly held.\"In other words, it ensures that city council's actions are perfectly legal, just because the B.C. legislature says so. This is objectionable, though not for the reasons the Kitsilano Coalition invokes.The group lambasted the bill as undemocratic. But this both misses the point, as the legislature is acting with a democratic mandate of its own, and begs the question of when people's decisions about what to do with their land should be subject to political meddling.Rather, the issues with B.C.'s proposed legislation have to do with the rule of law. For one thing, this bill would shield any errors in the process from independent judicial review. Freeing the government from the need to follow the rules is troubling ? unless, that is, the legislature has concluded that the procedure it had previously required is superfluous, after all.And this brings us to the second, and worst, problem: the bill picks favourites. The rule of law not only speaks to whether and how courts look at laws and decisions, but also how laws should be designed in the first place. Among other things, laws should consist of general rules for the future ? not commands or exemptions directed at particular people.General laws that apply to everyone at the outset leave people free to plan their lives around them. Specific, targeted directives subordinate people to arbitrary direction, which is liable to be exercised based on who can best curry favour with the government.This is exactly what's happening in B.C., as the legislation will apply to only the Arbutus project, exempting it - and it alone - from the normal requirements of the approval process. Meanwhile, every other project will continue to be bogged down in the zoning, regulatory and legal restrictions that plague the housing market.Case in point: The Sen?á?w development(https://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/senakw-development.aspx), a proposed project consisting of 11 residential towers on land owned by the Squamish Nation, is also facing a challenge from a NIMBY group over the nation's service agreement with the city. When asked whether the province would consider using similar legislation to push the Squamish development ahead, Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon was non-committal(https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/province-pushes-through-controversial-arbutus-project-to-circumvent-court-challenge).We are left wondering why. Isn't the Squamish project just as deserving as the Arbutus one? And, more to the point, why should the government's, or indeed anyone else's, view dictate which desperately needed housing project gets built? As it is, the Sen?á?w development - and likely many others - will be left to languish because of the government's arbitrary choice.The province ought to act in a more consistent manner by creating the conditions at the outset for an open and accessible housing market. Rather than using the law to impose the burdens of neighbourhood democracy on some projects while favouring others, the municipality and the province should remove the complex zoning requirements that have choked the housing supply.B.C.'s housing plan(https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/bc-housing-plan-legalize-suites-flipping-tax-zoning-rules) seems to move in the right direction, but the issue comes down to what the rules will be for anyone who seeks to develop land in the province. A predictable legal framework creates the conditions for development ? an example of the rule of law's relevance to the lives of all Canadians.The government has good reason to act against the NIMBY problem. But it must act in a way that is both more decisive and more principled, making housing development a priority in all cases and for all British Columbians.A one-off discretionary fix is a defective precedent for how to deal with mounting affordability problems. It will not solve these problems at scale; it will concentrate power in the government's hands; and it will chip away at the foundations of good government and shared prosperity.National PostLeonid Sirota teaches public law at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom.
