Any human being who values life must condemn these acts unequivocally, with no moral equivalence.Accordingly, the world must recognize that Israel is now defending itself in Gaza, as any country would, and that the fault for the unfortunate casualties that will inevitably occur among innocent Palestinians lies with Hamas. War is a terrible thing. But it's not Israel that asked for this war.Those who gather in cities around the world to celebrate the death and destruction perpetrated by Hamas andPalestinian Islamic Jihad,including in my former home state of New York, are in essence saying they believe in the slaughter of innocent individuals, that it's okay to shoot children in front of their parents, that it's acceptable to parade naked women naked and to massacre grandparents.They are saying that they are the enemy of Jews. But they are also saying that they are the enemies of peace and of the Palestinians as well for so deeply hurting their cause. These people should tell their loved ones, including their own grandparents, that this is what they stand for - death, destruction and misery.Opinion by Jason GreenblattTM & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
