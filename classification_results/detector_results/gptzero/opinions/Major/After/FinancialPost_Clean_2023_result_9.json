Regardless of the limits, however, workers could, and perhaps should, still self-reflect on the value they bring to their less than ideal job.William Watson: Where have all the workers gone? To time passing(https://financialpost.com/opinion/where-workers-gone-time-passing)Philip Cross: Face it, millennials: There is no realistic alternative to capitalism(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-no-realistic-alternative-to-capitalism)Opinion: Canadians are right to worry about immigration levels(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-canadians-are-right-to-worry-about-immigration-levels)By contrast, observations (often from survey data) about what is happening in the modern workplace tend to fixate on fads and superficial preferences. Examples of such preferences might include employees' advocacy for less customer-facing travel or less teamwork, since, as this narrative goes, Gen Z and Millennial workers, in distinction to other generations of workers, crave the autonomy, solitude and flexibility they enjoyed during pandemic lockdowns.Preference is not virtue. Preference is self-serving; virtue is community-serving. It is a constant to strive for, recognizing that it can never be fully achieved. A workplace is never perfect, but our role within it can be perfected.The goal of any job - and the goal of the tenacious entrepreneur who undertook financial risk to create that job for you - is to offer goods and services your community needs in order to fuel collective prosperity. Plato, if you were to meet him face to face, would say: \"be open to work hard\" and \"be open to self-reflection about what you bring to your job.\" After committing to that, you may still be discontented, but it would be a virtuous discontent.Neil Seeman is a senior fellow at Massey College in the University of Toronto.
