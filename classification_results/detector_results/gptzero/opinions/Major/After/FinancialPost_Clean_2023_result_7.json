A quarter had to delay travel plans and five per cent were so desperate they paid someone else to stand in line for them.Imagine the cursing and blood pressure spikes! This isn't service. It's dis-service and it undermines the trust between government and the people government is supposed to serve.An unnerving question arises when dealing with a red-tape headache like a passport renewal gone terribly wrong: Peace, Order and ... where has the Good Government gone? Only half the general public and a third of small-business owners think governments are doing a good job providing service, while over 90 per cent of both groups want governments to make it a high priority to reduce red tape and improve service delivery.Nova Scotia's leadership here is noteworthy. The province recognized red tape is plaguing its health-care system. In 2020, an innovative team that reports directly to the premier, the Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness, worked with provincial physicians to estimate the administrative burden doctors were dealing with and determine whether all of it was necessary. The results suggest that 62 per cent of the burden is in fact necessary - but 38 per cent is not. The province has set a target to reduce the unnecessary burden by 10 per cent, which would free up enough physician time to allow an astounding 150,000 patient visits annually.As two recent emergency-room tragedies have shown, Nova Scotia's health-care system is under great stress. Anything that can free up the time of overworked doctors and nurses so they can provide more and better patient care will pay substantial dividends.Matthew Lau: Government monopoly in childcare is not progress(https://financialpost.com/opinion/government-monopoly-childcare-not-progress)Bruce Pardy: ESG will kill capitalism, and freedom along with it(https://financialpost.com/opinion/esg-will-kill-capitalism-freedom)Jack Mintz: Federal employment growth is now out of hand(https://financialpost.com/opinion/jack-mintz-federal-employment-growth-is-now-out-of-hand)But the stress in the country's health-care system is a national problem. Extrapolating the Nova Scotia numbers nationwide, a 10 per cent reduction in red tape for doctors is the equivalent of 5.5 million patient visits. That's clearly worthy of attention.Most public policy challenges - from health care availability to housing affordability - could benefit from regular aggressive review of whether reducing red tape could improve our chances of getting the outcomes we are looking for. This has always been true, but labour shortages and an aging population make it more important than ever. In a labour-constrained environment, wasting time on an unnecessary process becomes even more costly and frustrating, whether inside or outside government. And red tape is especially hard on seniors. No one of any age likes an unnecessarily complex form or long line, but our capacity to deal with this hardship is higher at age 40 than age 80.Taxes and spending get a lot of scrutiny on a regular basis. The costs of excessive regulation are too often an afterthought, if even a thought at all. We need more measurement, more attention to service, and more initiatives like the one in Nova Scotia. It's past time that regulation gets the attention it deserves.Laura Jones is chief strategic officer at the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and creator of Canada's Red Tape Awareness Week, which begins Monday. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2023 Postmedia Network Inc.
