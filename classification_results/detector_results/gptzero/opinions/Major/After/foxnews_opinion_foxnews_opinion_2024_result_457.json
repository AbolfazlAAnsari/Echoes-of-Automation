CBS never mentioned this. ABC gave 10 seconds, and NBC offered 30 seconds acknowledging the laptop's use in court.None of them revisited their 2020 performance, when they all robotically regurgitated theBiden campaign spinthat the laptop was \"garbage\" carrying the \"earmarks of a Russian information operation.\"Prosecutors not only mined the laptop but used Hunter's addiction memoir \"Beautiful Things\" against him. That was quite a backfire, after the pro-Biden networks (and their affiliated comedians like Jimmy Kimmel) gushed over Hunter's memoir as \"catharsis\" for the 50-something child. Back in 2021, CBS donated 25 minutes of airtime to syrupy interview segments with the addict. Maybe \"donated\" is the wrong word since CBS-affiliated Simon & Schuster published the book.These guilty verdicts will not affect the pro-Biden media's incessant efforts to tout the Biden family as a selling point for the Democrats. They couldn't stop talking after the verdict about howthe first ladywas in the courtroom almost every day, and how the president scores points with voters when he talks about how much he loves his \"only surviving son.\"They will keep spinning in desperation that Hunter Biden's epic crack-and-hookers binges somehow make the Bidens more sympathetic to Americans with addicts in their family. Journalists were given cocaine-powdered lemons, and the lemonade they are making is a heady brew. But not everyone wants to drink it.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TIM GRAHAMGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
