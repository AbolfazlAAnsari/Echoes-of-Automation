Now, Rishi Sunak is champing at the bit in his seeming distaste for lockdowns.But if, as stated, they were right – and if other countries employed this strategy – were they completely wrong as well? It doesn’t add up. In those early, very frightening days it did indeed save lives and stopped the NHS collapsing completely under the weight of this dire, unknowable and lethal virus.So here we go again, populist tropes to appeal to the freedom-loving Conservative membership is wrong-footed and misleading. Because many of these members will have very sadly lost family members. Personally speaking, if Professors Whitty, Valance and the great Jonathan Van-Tam were standing in this leadership contest, I would join the party and vote for any of them – because they enlisted my trust and gave us hard, unpalatable facts with assurance, knowledge and expertise.But as they are not, I will adjure these candidates from going down this populist kamikaze path for short-term political gain, because it might come back to haunt them – and so, indeed, it should.Judith A. DanielsNorfolkWe need solutions to how journalism should respond to populismSean O’Grady argues that the BBC must be “seen to be impartial”and what that means is defined by public opinion. The problemEmily Maitlisis pointing out is that this means journalism is impotent in the face of populism. Populist leaders push and divide public opinion to extremes and absurdities, whilst undermining confidence in journalism, and journalists go with it in a vain hope for balance and reasonableness, so treating absurdities and cruelties as legitimate topics of discussion.Sean O’Grady insists journalists must do that; Emily Maitlis argues they must not. The problem if they do is two-fold. We, the readers, lose confidence in journalists who appear weak and vacuous. And journalists become more and more entrapped by the tactics of populism. Sean O’Grady offers no solution to how journalism should respond to populism, as Emily Maitlis really tried to do at the end of her presentation.Duncan FisherCrickhowell"
