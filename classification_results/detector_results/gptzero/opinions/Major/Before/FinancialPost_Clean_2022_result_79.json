For Canada, that means bolstering our presence, investment and leadership in NATO's northern flank, and taking a more proactive role in protecting our national security.But first we need to understand what the security risks in the region are.

The Arctic remains a difficult and expensive region to navigate in and extract resources from. In many ways, climate changes make it harder, not easier, to operate in the Arctic as ice patterns change, weather gets more unpredictable, and permafrost melts.But there are two areas in the Arctic that do have heightened security risk.
