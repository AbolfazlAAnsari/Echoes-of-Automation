His task was to rebuild the ANC after nine years of neglect and malfeasance.Instead, my friend argued, the president had squandered the opportunity, in large part because he didn't understand that he had a mission that was about the times in which he was living, rather than being about any particular ambitions he may have had for himself.It's an argument that has a lot of merit. Mandela had a historical mission, which was to unite a divided nation. There is now widespread recognition in the country that while Mandela was a special man, he also managed the transition to democracy by navigating the political externalities of the times - the end of communism, the effectiveness of sanctions and the success of domestic pressure on the apartheid regime - and rising to the occasion.The Australian context may be different, but the country faces a similarly significant leadership crisis. The country's leaders must also rise to the occasion after a wasted decade.Under the Coalition, Australia has been left behind on every defining issue of the millennium - from climate change to race relations to refugee rights and workers' rights. The increasingly rightwing policies of the Liberal Party have facilitated a politics that is both small-minded and mean-spirited.As a result, Australia finds itself in the unenviable position of having plenty of wealth and no vision. In the coming years, the country faces more bushfires and floods, more drought and extreme weather events, and yet in playgrounds and sports fields around the country, in the next few weeks, people will nod and smile at one another and avoid the kinds of robust conversations that are necessary in momentous times.This will not do: if everyday Aussies can learn anything from South Africa it is that they dare not be silent. They must care more about their futures than they do about maintaining an appearance of political propriety.Scott Morrison is no Mandela, nor is Anthony Albanese, but the stakes of this election are incredibly high. Whoever wins at the polls be entrusted with a historical mandate they dare not betray."
