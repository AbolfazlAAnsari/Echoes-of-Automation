We are waiting to see what action the Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing is going to take to address housing affordability concerns. There have been indications that it understands we are in a supply crisis and it plans to enact legislation that will support development. The feds, sadly, are nowhere in this debate; the 2017 National Housing Strategy has done essentially nothing(https://www.policynote.ca/national-housing-strategy/ ) to address housing affordability, which has only eroded greatly since this policy was enacted.If we want to see anything done by our elected representatives, our best hope right now is at the municipal level. When your local incumbent or candidate knocks on your door this September, I encourage you to ask them how they plan to address housing affordability. If your priority is protecting the value of the home you already own, vote for the candidate who will tell you development is best elsewhere. If you believe a solution to the housing crisis is necessary, listen for progressive city-building solutions that will make our cities better for everyone, and vote accordingly.Financial PostRandy Gladman is Senior Vice-President, Development Advisory, at Colliers Strategy &; Consulting Group. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
