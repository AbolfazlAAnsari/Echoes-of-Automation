In August, before Q3 earnings season, we argued there was no policy rationale for the continuing moratorium on dividend increases. At the time, earnings and capital were already at all-time highs. Moreover, the banks had set aside an enormous amount, approximately $21.4 billion, of allowances against performing loans, courtesy of the new provision accounting adopted in 2018. This huge reserve represents a powerful firewall against unexpected losses. There has literally never been a time in Canadian bank history where the sector was in a stronger position to pay dividends.In absolute terms, the level of dividend increases will be influenced by the strength of earnings and capital. Last quarter, core earnings reached an all-time high of $15.1 billion, or approximately 23 per cent above pre-pandemic levels. Over this same period, common equity Tier 1, or CET1 ratios - the world's most important capital ratio - rose 150 bps to 13 per cent. This increase makes the Canadian banks among the best capitalized banks globally.We expect the banks will release another $4 billion to $6 billion of reserves in the next several quarters, placing continued upward pressure on both earnings and capital. Reserve releases are typically accompanied with below-trend credit costs that would support earnings and capital. In absence of any capital deployments or buybacks, the banks' CET1 ratios are likely headed to 13.5 per cent or higher, creating even more capacity to raise dividends.So, how much and when?In terms of how much, current earnings and capital could support immediate dividend increases of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent, even if earnings completely stalled. At this level, the banks would return to pre-pandemic payout ratios, and capital ratios would continue to remain high. Dividends could increase by even more if any of several catalysts emerge/strengthen: (i) sustained lower provision ratios, (ii) higher net interest margins from changes in the yield curve (in Canada or the U.S.), and/or (iii) loan growth increases as the economy reopens further.Although earnings are the biggest driver of dividends, capital is an important variable.
