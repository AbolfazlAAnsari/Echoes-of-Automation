And the answer to this question is not only important for Ohio but for the nation's political future.Among the so-called swing states, the Buckeye State isfourth in electoral heftbehind only Texas, Florida and Pennsylvania. With Ohio in tow, and with the changes in assigned electoral votes after the 2020 reapportionment, a GOP candidate would only have to add Georgia and Pennsylvania to Trump's tally in 2020 to win an electoral majority.What should we be looking for when analyzing the Ohio vote on November 8? Political scientists like to divide Ohio up intofive somewhat distinct regions: Northeast, Northwest, Central, Southeast and Southwest.

Everything changedfour years later, when only four Northeast Ohio counties voted for the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. By2020, that number dropped to two for Joe Biden.In between 2016 and 2020, however, was the2018midterm election -- featuring statewide races for governor and the US Senate. In the gubernatorial contest, former Republican Sen. and Lt. Gov. Mike DeWine won, nearly matching Trump by taking seven Northeast Ohio counties.But also running that same year was incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who was re-elected while winning one more Northeast Ohio county than DeWine captured. In fact, with one exception (Stark County), Brown's performance mirrored Obama's 2012 victory.
