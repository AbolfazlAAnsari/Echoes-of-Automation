Having voted to leave the EU myself, I know, in common with the millions of others who did the same, that there is absolutely no commonality between the two.Four years ago, Hilary Clinton and the Democrats conceded gracefully when they lost (despite gaining more votes) after a democratic vote. This year, Trump did not accede to a democratic vote but tried to force a change.The Scottish Nationalists have not accepted a democratic vote and want to keep trying until they get the result they want. The Irish forced a second vote on the constitutional terms of the Maastricht Treaty in the Nineties to change the vote they didn’t like.And those who voted to remain in the EU are doing the same – like Trump and the SNP, they are not willing to accept a democratic vote, which was strongly confirmed in the last general election. They now resort to hectoring and belittling those of us who believe it was the right thing to do.I have been on the losing side of many elections and, like the majority of right-minded people, I have had to accept the result and get on with making the best of it.Our country will thrive as it always has.Christine LathamFlamborough, YorkshireLaw to blame over WindrushExcellent article expressing the views and opinions of Caroline Nokes ('Government’s ‘inhuman’ approach to immigration will not work and will cost more, says former Home Office minister’, 10 January).As a former minister she appears to have an excellent understanding of the job and a vision which many would be proud to share regardless of any political persuasion.One minor concern, however. Ms Nokes states: “You have to be able to look at a decision and know that it’s been fairly scrutinised and that the decision is the right one, and that’s where the legal system comes in.”The law is the law and often it is not (seen as) fair. Surely something like the Windrush fiasco occurred because the legislation itself was wrong and subsequently gave scope for a variety of interpretations/implementations, which caused so much damage.Peter H WilliamsAyrshireRead MoreLabour party members need to give Keir Starmer their supportWill the events at Capitol Hill create stigma towards Americans?The world will be a safer place when Joe Biden is inauguratedPelosi leads first vote on Trump today -follow live"
