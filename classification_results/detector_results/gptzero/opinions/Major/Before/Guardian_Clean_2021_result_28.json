Second, if we're talking about gold wallpaper,  or ceiling-to-sofa flock fabric,  it's clear that Symonds is fond of the grand gesture.And so am I, because a grand gesture is how you carpe diem: it's about releasing your individuality and committing yourself to a full-blooded, colourful life, not living among the timid and the greige.

An example of a lack of self-knowledge was when a pregnant Kim Kardashian allowed Kanye West to clothe her, from gloved fingertip to toe, in aclingy Givenchy floral dress, looking, as Robin Williams rightlytweeted at the time, like Mrs Doubtfire.As for Symonds, spending money you don't actually have, without finagling a questionable loan, is a classic sign of someone not being honest about who they are; you're trying to be someone else, who has a life you don't have. It's at that point that your grand gesture is no longer admirable - it's just bad taste.If Symonds really wants to learn how to pull off big gestures, I would advise her to spend less time looking at the Instagram feeds of Sloaney designers such asLulu Lytleand her wholesale lifestyle look, which allegedly inspired her, and more time listening toMeat Loaf.I've been a Meat Loaf fan for a long time, and being a Meat Loaf fan means being a Jim Steinman fan, because Steinman wrote all of the Loaf's operatic, joyful triumphs.
