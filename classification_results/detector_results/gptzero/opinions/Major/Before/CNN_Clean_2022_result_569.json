(Qatar's World Cup chief in aBritish TV interviewadmitted to much lower but still sobering 400 to 500 deaths of migrants who readied the Gulf nation for the event.)More tragic losses followed - the deaths of soccer writer extraordinaireGrant Wahl- a towering figure in the field as well as a really nice guy - andQatari photojournalist Khalid al-Misslam.Yet there was beauty to be found in this controversial and grief-diminished World Cup, particularly the story of Morocco. The run of the Atlas Lions, whose trip to the semifinals against France made it a first and only on many levels as they marched through what felt like a master class in post-colonial history - Belgium, Spain, Portugal - to inspire an enduring Pan-Arab spirit.Just as Croatia announced itself to the world four years ago, Morocco, too, is just getting started, thenation's investment in soccerbearing fruit lush and deep. While Morocco fell to Croatia in Saturday's match for third place, in a multitude of ways this was its tournament, its fans flocking to Qatar in such numbers that Qatar Airwayscanceled flightsthe morning of its semifinal match, hoping to curb the overwhelming surge.Yet if Morocco was the team of the tournament, Messi was its towering figure, his merch becoming more scarce than Taylor Swift tickets, crashing Adidas stores worldwide. His global superstardom helped soccer stay center stage amid all the chaos that has surrounded this Qatar World Cup for the last 12 years.Not quite ready to be in the sport's rearview mirror, he solidified foundations for what a generational international soccer star can look, play and be like, including his impending retirement. \"Through it all, Lionel Messi has defied the machismo in Argentine football in his own gentle way,\" historianBrenda Elsey recently observed in The New York Times. \"Football stadiums are part of a sexist ecosystem where displays of misogyny and homophobia are commonplace; organized fans called 'barras bravas' have created terrifying conditions during matches. Messi has rejected this violence. ...\"Such positioning of Messi comes just in time for next year when the World Cup heads down under to New Zealand and Australia for the women's championship, withearly tickets salesalready making headlines.While the US men's team performed admirably in Qatar, making it to the knockout round after failing to qualify four years ago and bringing home thefirst World Cup paycheckunder US Soccer's new collective bargaining agreement centered on equal pay, the American women will belooking to defend a title, having defeated the Dutch in 2019 for their fourth World Cup crown.But increasing global interest in the women's game means it will not be easy for the American women to stay on top, as their dynasty faces worthy challengers from a range of squads, including former champions Japan, Germany and Norway as well as Sweden, Brazil and China.Their success is key in continuing to shift America's notorious apathy toward the beautiful game. Despite soccer consistently building television ratings, merchandise and ticket sales, American disdain for it remains a real thing, keeping the sport outside the realm of the \"big three\" - football, baseball, basketball - despite the thousands of children who hit the pitch every weekend, spring and fall, the growing Major League Soccer and National Women's Soccer League crowds, and the devout fan base of \"Ted Lasso.\"Accusations that soccer is tedious, the behavior of \"flopping\" players is ludicrous, the timekeeping is bewildering, and that the offside rule makes no sense create a divide between those who think soccer has finally arrived in the United States and those who claim it has not and never will.That it is the relative low score of soccer games that seems to be the chief complaint of many (especially those who ignore the math that goes into an American football game) demonstrates a gap of understanding of soccer that remains in the United States. The scores are low because, well, soccer is hard - a fluid game played across an enormous expanse of green space whose players maneuver a small ball with grace, patience and power while running andmoving nearly constantly for miles.It is critical for Americans to wrap their collective heads around this, not just to cheer on the US women next year, but also because, again, in just four years' time, the men's World Cup is coming to16 cities across North America. The United States will host most of the matches, with cities in Canada and Mexico also playing host.The microscope that has been put on Qatar, its people and its politics, with detailed and valid conversations about sport washing and greenwashing, will shift to the United States, where issues of reproductive health restrictions, carbon footprint and the world's overwhelming lead body count from gun violence will be in tension with liberties such as the recent reinforcements around same-sex and interracial marriage - a symbol of how messy and chaotic the home of the free, the land of the brave, can be.And whether it is called soccer or football (and really, again, it can be both), one thing is clear, regardless of what England's fans might be chanting: No one will be bringing anything home. After the 2022 World Cup, it is clearer now than perhaps ever before that the world - the whole world - is the home of its most popular game. So, Americans - whether watching the women next year or the men in 2026 - better get ready. They don't have to like it. But they should understand it. And it won't be easy. Because soccer is hard.Opinion by Amy BassTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
