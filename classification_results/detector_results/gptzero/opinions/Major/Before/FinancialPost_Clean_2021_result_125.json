But if you broaden the group of comparison countries and use an alternative measure of indebtedness, you get a very different picture of Canada's debt.In an IMF ranking of 29 industrialized countries, Canada comes in 19th with a net debt-to-GDP ratio of 33.0 per cent. Eighteen of the 29 countries have higher debt ratios than we do. So that's a reasonably good showing for us. But move from net debt (which adjusts for financial assets) to gross debt (a measure of total indebtedness), and Canada rises to fifth out of 29. That's not so good - this is a ranking you don't want to top. Only Japan, Italy, Portugal and the United States have higher ratios of gross debt to GDP than we do.And no other country experiences such a dramatic rise in its debt ranking - 14 places - when moving from net debt to gross debt.

This is important because the Canada and Quebec plans are unusual in the industrialized world in that, due to reforms in 1996, they invest in assets other than government bonds, including corporate bonds and stocks. This affects Canada's measurement of net debt.Consider a hypothetical case where a government borrows $1 billion to finance spending while its public pension simultaneously buys $1 billion in bonds. The government's gross debt increases by $1 billion but its net debt doesn't change because there's both an asset (the bond held by the pension plan) and a liability.
