The free world will be locked in a new Cold War and possible military confrontations with Russia as Putin tries to recreate the Soviet empire.Nato should be encouraged to increase its military forces; and offensive missile systems should be deployed in Nato countries. Russia has exhibited inhumanity to man, and it is the immoral enemy of mankind.Donald MoskowitzLondonderryPriti pictureEvery time I see a photo of Priti Patel in The Independent, the old Brecht/Weill song comes into my head:'Oh the shark hasShiny teeth, dearAnd she keeps themPearly white'I wondered if your picture editor has the same tune running through their head?Iain BoydBristolTo keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter byclicking hereTeachers deserve respectIn regard to yourexhausted teachersarticle (8 April). It's about bloody time...As a chair of governors my personal concern for at least the last 18 months has been for the physical and mental well-being of our staff across the board, leaders, teachers and support staff. Repeatedly required to continue education with reams of \"guidance\", in school and remote learning at the drop of a hat, exams but then again no exams, non existent catch up tuition... the list is endless.And every time no warning, no help, just an expectation that the usual edict from government would result in action and a result.I have thought hard about taking a public stance, but as I survey our children in A-level years, who have taken no exams at GCSE level now, dealing with exams that will determine their future. And the continuing efforts of our staff to support them and their confidence and mental health through this Easter break, with extra online and in-person tuition after all we have fought through to give our children a good foundation for the future, enough is enough.Britain needs to refocus on the needs of our children and the brilliant educationalists and all who underpin them to strengthen our future.All public services have received the same treatment. They have simply been expected to carry on regardless. Unseen but underpinning our nation they continued to educate, empty bins, nurture our health and so on.They are heroes and heroines yes, but most of all they are spartans for their determination and resilience. For this they are due recognition and respect.AnonEngland"
