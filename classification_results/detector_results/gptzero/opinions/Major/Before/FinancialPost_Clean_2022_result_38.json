Acting on these views, which PoiliÃ¨vre would do, could generate: hundreds of billions of dollars in economic growth, funding for essential social programs, thousands of jobs, aid to our allies, repaired national unity and reduced net global GHG emissions as Asia replaces coal with Canadian natural gas.Liberals also underestimate an effective political leader's ability to change public opinion, particularly when existing policies are not working and there is an urgent need for innovative ideas to cope with new challenges. We are at that point.The pandemic has exacerbated systemic problems of uncompetitive productivity, capital flight, insipid longer-term growth prospects, massive debt, static per capita income and geopolitical threats that, taken together, weaken Canada's economy and standing in the world. We are heading down a dystopian path that can damage living standards, threaten national unity, erode personal freedom and undermine national sovereignty.Pierre PoiliÃ¨vre has an ambitious agenda to reverse this decline. He would reduce taxes and regulations, take on \"gatekeepers\" who block housing construction, develop our natural resources, abolish the carbon tax, combat inflation by containing profligate spending, balance the federal budget, facilitate cryptocurrency adoption, foster economic growth, protect civil liberties including freedom of speech, oppose internet censorship, counter wokism, defend our history, rebuild the military and de-fund the CBC. These policy goals are widely shared by Canadians, even though they are anathema in progressive silos where affluent urbanites, legacy media moguls and tenured academics celebrate diversity but dismiss dissenting opinions as \"unacceptable,\" in Justin Trudeau's chilling parlance. Pace Hillary Clinton's \"basket of deplorables.\"An authentic Conservative leader who communicates an ambitious and optimistic vision and innovative policies can win the day. Diluting conservative principles with failed liberal ideology and dysfunctional policies would be both bad politics and bad policy.Joe Oliver is a former minister of natural resources and minister of finance in the government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper. He served in cabinet with Pierre PoiliÃ¨vre. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved."
