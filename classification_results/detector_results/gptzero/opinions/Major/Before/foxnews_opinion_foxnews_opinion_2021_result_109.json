Are Virginia school officials committed to actually providing students with a safe environment, even if it is at odds with their political narratives?Gubernatorial candidate Terry McAulliffe recently said that he doesn’t \"think parents should be telling schools what they should teach\" and vetoed a bill that would have required schools to give parents more information about sexually explicit content covered in school.Now Biden administration officials in Washington, D.C. are seeking to label concerned parents as domestic terrorists. What’s going on here? Why is the left demonizing parents and suggesting that we somehow aren’t supposed to be our children’s chief advocate and responsible for ensuring that they grow to be healthy and responsible adults?Our public school leaders have lost my trust, and I know I’m not alone. Virginia parents—and most importantly, Virginia’s students—deserve better. Virginia law actually states that parents are supposed to have input into their child’s education.It’s time to make that a reality.
