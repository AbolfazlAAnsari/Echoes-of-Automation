Defend us.Keep us from giving in to temptation to believe the end justifies the means; to plot a course for this nation that is in opposition to You; to wound those who have wounded us; to seek revenge and retribution. We need You now, more than ever.On this day, Jan. 20, 2021, we acknowledge that Yours is the glory and the power.You have the final word. You keep the books. You are the Judge of both the living and the dead.One day each of us will stand before You and be held accountable for the way we have lived … what we have said and what we have done.Help us to live every day in the light of who You are with That Day on our minds.In the name of the One who taught us to pray … Jesus.Amen.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANNE GRAHAM LOTZAnne Graham Lotz – called \"the best preacher in the family\" by her father, Billy Graham – is an international speaker and the bestselling and award-winning author of numerous books, including \"Jesus Followers\"co-authored with her daughter Rachel-Ruth Lotz Wright.Lotz is the president of AnGeL Ministries in Raleigh, North Carolina, and the former chairperson for the National Day of Prayer.www.annegrahamlotz.com"
