However, when his administration finally released their national action plan to implement the calls on June 3, it was criticized by various Indigenous leaders and political parties.\"The document released today is an offensive performance by the government to skirt responsibility and glaze over the ongoing genocide of women and girls,\" said Melissa Moses, Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs women's representative.Just two days earlier on June 1, the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC) announced that they were leaving the national plan, citing a \"toxic and dysfunctional\" process, and released Our Calls, Our Actions, with 65 specific actions they plan to take to address the Calls for Justice.It's heartening that the NWAC made such a bold move, but the stalled justice is disappointing and does nothing to empower Indigenous children. As a child in the foster care system, my family and I needed resources for healing, retribution from the violence of colonialism, and for the government to uphold its Treaty obligations signed by my ancestors.My prayer is that Canadians will wake up. That they'll stand beside our sisters who are being taken. We can't rely on governments for everything - this needs to come from the hearts of the people. What will you tell your grandchildren one day when they learn you lived during a genocide? Did you help? Or did you look away? !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved."
