(George Conway, a prominent attorney in town, is notorious for brutally and publiclycriticizing his wife's former boss.)During his four years in office, Trump mercilesslyattacked the press, refusing to attend the annual bash at whichAmerica's Fourth Estate fetes its luminariesand celebrates its own accomplishments.

Noah joked that Saturday night's swank dinner was \"the nation's most distinguished superspreader event.\"Attendees in the packed ballroom of more than 2,000 journalists, celebrities, politicians and Washington insiders were doubtless hoping Saturday that they will not repeat that debacle.The return of the dinner reaffirmed the important fact that we now have a President who respects the press and can take some heat. (President Joe Biden even confirmed to Noah he wouldn't go to jail for roasting him.)But it wasn't all good-natured kidding. In his speech,Biden recognizedthat the dinner was happening with \"disinformation massively on the rise, where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth.\"What the President was getting at was what social media has done to the country. Americans used to get their news from the traditional media; now about half at least sometimes get their news from social networks, according to a2021 Pew Research Center survey. And, as we all know,misinformation is rampanton social media.While Europe justannounced a new lawto fight disinformation, federal lawmakers in the US -- the birthplace of social media -- haven't taken action. In fact, Congress has passed justtwo federal lawsregulating the tech industry over the past 25 years. It needs to get to work. As I've said before, one reasonable way to fight the problem would be byfining social networksfor potentially deadly disinformation that goes viral.Noah also hit the nail on the head when he joked that print reporters felt that others in the industry were showing off that they have homes when they worked from home during the pandemic. That's because so much of theadvertising revenuethat used to support the press now goes to tech companies such as Facebook and Google that don't pay media companies when linking to their content.This needs to change.Australia became the first placeto require tech companies to pay the media for hosting their content, and it's already having a big effect, helping create new jobs reporting on underserved areas in the country. It's time for the US to follow suit. But none of this was discussed Saturday night.It was also unfortunate that the exclusive establishment event wasn't more inclusive. No serious recognition was given to members of the profession or other Americans who can't attend indoor events with thousands of people. Attendees were required to be vaccinated and boosted and test negative for the coronavirus on Saturday before attending. But that didn't eliminate all risk, which is why the President's chief medical adviser,Dr. Anthony Fauci, didn't go.It would have been nice to see serious recognition of the many people whose personal circumstances put them most at risk from the return to \"normalcy.\" CNN political correspondentKasie Hunt pointed outon her CNN+ show that \"Everybody else might've moved on, but people with little kids just have not been able to.\" That's because Covid-19 vaccines aren't available for children under age 5 (including my own).The ceremony recognized the heroism of people in the profession, including journalistAustin Tice, who was captured while reporting in Syria a decade ago, and members of the industry who have lost their lives in Ukraine. And it celebrated the first two women of color to serve as White House correspondents,Alice Dunnigan and Ethel Payne.But in announcing a new award in their honor, \"CBS Mornings\" co-anchor Gayle King referred to the audience as \"ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls\" -- language evenDisney doesn't use anymore. There's an opportunity to be more inclusive of people who don't conform to these traditional gender roles next year.The generally good-natured dinner was an important step forward for the country in reaffirming respect for the press, though it remains to be seen whether it will also prove to be a setback if attendees do contract Covid-19 en masse. If they don't, next year's event may give us more to laud and laugh about.Opinion by Kara AlaimoTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
