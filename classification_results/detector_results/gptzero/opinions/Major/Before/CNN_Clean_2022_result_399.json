Asked whether McCarthy should be the next speaker of the House, sheflatly replied, \"No.\"\"Every single moment when our time of testing came, and Kevin had to make a decision about what he was going to do, he's made the politically easy for him -- or the politically expedient -- decision instead of what the country needed,\" Cheney said.Noting that the House speaker is next in line of succession after the vice president, she said that what the country needs in an official \"who's going to be that close to the presidency\" is \"somebody who's faithful to the Constitution.\"Cheney couldn't be more right about McCarthy. He is the same person who, days after the January 6 attack, stood on the House floor andlambasted Trump, saying: \"The President bears responsibility\" for the attack on the Capitol. \"He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding.\"But just two weeks later, McCarthy gave us a profile in cowardice when hetraveled to Mar-a-Lago, where he posed for a photo with Trump and kissed his ring. Apparently calculating that he would need support from Trump's base to win in 2022, McCarthy put his own ambition to become House speaker over his concerns for our republic.What makes Cheney's words potentially persuasive to a sizable subset of Republicans is that she's a diehard conservative and was a vocal Trump supporter before the events of January 6.In a July 2020Fox News interview, she made it clear that the top priority for her and her House GOP caucus was to ensure that Joe Biden did not win,sayingthat she supported Trump's agenda \"something like 97% of the time.\"But to her credit,  Cheney started speaking out publicly about the potential danger Trump posed to our republic -- even before the 2020 election. We saw that in September 2020, when Trump refused to commit to accepting the election results if he lost, instead saying, we will \"have to see what happens.\"In response, Cheney took to Twitter,writing, \"The peaceful transfer of power is enshrined in our Constitution and fundamental to the survival of our Republic. America's leaders swear an oath to the Constitution. We will uphold that oath.\"Obviously, today Cheney has become known as a fierce critic of Trump and other election deniers. In fact, during her interview Saturday, shevowedto campaign against Kari Lake, Arizona's election-denying GOP gubernatorial candidate whom Trump has endorsed.But we know that Cheney'snot alone in the GOPin holding firmly to her conservative values while staunchly supporting the rule of law and rejecting Trump and the MAGA wing of the Republican Party.The hope now is that the same type of Republicans who supported Cheney in her primary loss turn out across the nation during this November's election. If they choose country over party, they will be playing a big role in protecting our Constitution and our democratic republic from those who pose a threat to both.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
