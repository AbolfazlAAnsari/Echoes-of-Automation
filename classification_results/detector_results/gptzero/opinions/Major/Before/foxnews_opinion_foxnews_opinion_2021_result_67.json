Itâs insulting after the U.S. gave so much taxpayer money to Covax.While we arenât directly funding the Chinese payday, thereâs little difference. The situation is one step removed from the U.S. giving China a massive check.President Biden has failed to solve this obvious problem. Heâs simultaneously undermining America in another way. Biden is supporting a global effort that would force the United States to give up the secret to its vaccine success.Right now, the World Trade Organization is pushing a proposal that would let other countries effectively steal data from U.S. vaccine makers. They would then use this information to manufacture the vaccines themselves. Not only does this hurt the American companies that invested billions of dollars to create these medical breakthroughs, it also plays right into Chinaâs hands.The tyrants in Beijing desperately want to figure out how to make vaccines that are as good as Americaâs â especially since Chinaâs current vaccines are well-known to be less effective. The Communist Party wants to position itself as a global leader in health care and an alternative to the United States.Now China is getting what it wants. It wouldnât have to hack U.S. companies, because Biden would be handing over our secrets on a silver platter. Thereâs a reason America led the world on vaccine development, but Biden is ensuring we wonât maintain our lead.All of these actions make a mockery of Americaâs generosity.America should be as generous as possible. But itâs just as important to show goodÂ  judgment.The United States should not let global bodies abuse the fact that we created a vaccine in record time or squander our money in the campaign to vaccinate the world. Itâs wrong to do that, period. Itâs doubly wrong when it strengthens China, our biggest competitor.If Joe Biden wants to make the most of Americaâs generosity while upholding our interests, there are three things he should do immediately.First, demand that Covax not buy Chinese vaccines. If the U.N.-led effort refuses, the U.S. should stop providing money and vaccine doses. Instead, the U.S. should give these resources directly to countries that need them, in order to avoid a bureaucracy that stabs us in the back.Second, defend American innovation by opposing the World Trade Organizationâs assault on our vaccine makers. The U.S. can help other countries vaccinate their people without hurting our own ability to create medical breakthroughs. There is never a good reason to hobble American companies while giving Communist China a leg up.Finally, rethink Americaâs approach to global institutions. The current problems stem from Bidenâs belief that itâs better to be along for the ride, even when the U.S. suffers and reform is impossible. This is foolish. The United States should expect more from the institutions we support. We should never accept it when they undermine our interests.By all means, America should be as generous as possible. But itâs just as important to show goodÂ  judgment.The United States is being taken advantage of, and Communist China stands to benefit the most. Thatâs wrong, itâs dangerous, and it has to stop. NIKKI HALEYNikki Haley is running for president. She was governor of South Carolina and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations."
