The pandemic has brought to the surface a range of opportunities for solving many problems, including homelessness, if we muster the political will to do so.New York City mayors from Ed Koch to Bill de Blasio have made commitments to provide thousands of units of affordable housing, and progress has been made. But it’s too little too late. We need to take a “big picture” approach to address the crisis of homelessness rather than build one building at a time.We have many of the resources needed: underused hotels, construction companies with spare capacity, commercial buildings that could be repurposed as live-and-work spaces, and nonprofits that are capable of providing needed support services.Repurposing the $2 billion New York City spends to provide shelter for homeless families and individuals plus the billions spent as a result of homelessness can provide a war chest to build affordable housing on the scale we need.Claire AltmanNew YorkThe writer is a consultant for affordable housing and community development.To the Editor:Binyamin Appelbaum’s wonderful article about homelessness included this line, quoting a United Nations official about homelessness in California: “There’s a cruelty here that I don’t think I’ve seen.”My mind took me back to the late 1980s, when I lived in New York City and went to graduate school. One night on the subway, a homeless man was asleep across a couple of seats. A man grabbed his legs and swung them to the floor.The sleeping man fell out of the seat and awoke with a start and a yelp. Someone across the car who could have passed for Archie Bunker gave the thumbs-up sign.I remain haunted by that moment, and my failure to say or do anything. The cruelty is always with us.Michael GreenLas VegasPHOTO:   (PHOTOGRAPH BY Agnes Lee FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
