Pineal calcification rates with Africans are five to 15 percent [sic], Asians 15 to 25 percent [sic] and Europeans 60 to 80 percent [sic]. This is the chemical basis for the cultural differences between blacks and whites [sic].\"Five: Melanin endows Blacks with greater mental, physical and spiritual abilities -- something which cannot be measured based on Eurocentric standards.\"The above is not an editorial from the Final Call, Louis Farrakhan's free newspaper. That is a direct quote from the person Joe Biden is about to put in charge of this country's civil rights laws.BIDEN'S PICK FOR TOP DOJ CIVIL RIGHTS POST HAS CALLED FOR PARTIALLY DEFUNDING POLICEEven at Harvard, crackpot theories like that were considered deranged and dangerous. After an outcry on campus, Kristen Clarke suggested that she didn't necessarily believe what she had written. The left-wing Harvard Crimson didn’t buy that explanation. \"Well, does she or doesn't she?\"wrote the editors. \"So far, she has given us every indication that she does.\"Just a month later, Clarke invited the noted Trinidadian anti-Semite Tony Martin to speak on campus. Martin, then a professor at Wellesley College, was the author of a self-published manifesto called \"The Jewish Onslaught.\" In it, Martin chronicled the \"escalating Jewish onslaught\" against Black people.For Martin's fans like Kristen Clarke, his speech at Harvard did not disappoint. He attacked both Jews and Judaism as a religion. Martin, who retired from Wellesley in 2007 and died in 2013, spent his final years giving speeches to Holocaust denial organizations on topics such as \"tactics of organized Jewry in suppressing free speech.\"Kristen Clarke strongly approved of Tony Martin, telling The Crimson: \"Professor Martin is an intelligent, well-versed Black intellectual who bases his information on indisputable fact.\" According to Kristen Clarke, Tony Martin's anti-Semitism was based on \"indisputable fact.\"Kristen Clarke has never shed these views. They've simply become more sophisticated. Just last year, Clarke was fighting for the crudest kind of racial discrimination in college admissions, saying it was \"madness\" for the federal government to take the side of Asian applicants who had provably been denied college admission on the basis of their skin color.Speaking of madness, in a sane country, someone like Kristen Clarke would be under investigation by the Civil Rights Division, not running it. We will see if Clarke's nomination gets to the U.S. Senate. If it does, we're in serious trouble.This article is adapted from a portion of Tucker Carlson's remarks on the Jan. 11, 2021 edition of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\""
