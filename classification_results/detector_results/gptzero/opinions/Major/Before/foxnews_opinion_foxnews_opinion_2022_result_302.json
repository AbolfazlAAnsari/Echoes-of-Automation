It’s a 12- or 18-inch-wide pipe, usually made of corrugated steel or plastic, that goes under a driveway that allows for water drainage. I know about culvert pipes from personal experience.As a little boy on a dare offered by a \"friend,\" I started crawling through a long one of these, only to get stuck in the middle with my arms in front of me. Then came the panic. I could not move. This wasclaustrophobia at its worst. Thankfully a compassionate friend (clearly not the same \"friend\") had pity on me and pulled me out.WHY YOUR BIBLE MAY HAVE A BLANK PAGE IN IT AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOUDecades later I crawled into a culvert pipe again. But this one was a massive contraption, clean and white…and plugged into the wall: A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine.Just walking into the room where my body was going to slide into this monster sped my heart. That culvert-pipe panic returned. Obediently I laid down on the toboggan-like sled that would insert my body, feet first, into the hollow. If you’ve had this experience, you’re with me aren’t you. Your heart is pounding, too. Right?The nice technician began describing what was about to happen, including the loud clicking noises when it’s taking pictures. I tried to focus but found my fears speeding ahead of her explanation.God was right there. Searching me. Nothing is hidden from Him. Whatever I have inside, He knows. Every. Single. Thing. No technician will be necessary to evaluate the results.And then I remembered something that changed everything. My sister, eight years my junior, has been my buddy her whole life.

Inside the tube. I’m facing two unrelated cancers and the news may be frightening. But instead of terror, my heart was filled with truth. Even joy and calm.An MRI brain scan of head and skull(iStock)Like a compassionate father,God was right there. Searching me. Nothing is hidden from Him. Whatever I have inside, He knows. Every. Single. Thing. No technician will be necessary to evaluate the results. He sees. He hears my fears. My repentant voice. He forgives. He heals. He restores. He adores…me.Because of the sobering diagnoses I was facing, there were many more visits to the MRI. Potentially frightening memories of the culvert pipe notwithstanding, every time inside the tube was beautiful. Wonderful. Cleansing. Every single one. It’s true.Brain disease diagnosis with medical doctor seeing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) film diagnosing elderly aging patient neurodegenerative illness problem for neurological medical treatment(iStock)Even if you’ve never had an experience inside anMRI tube, real or imagined, please be encouraged by the truth that God knows your heart.
