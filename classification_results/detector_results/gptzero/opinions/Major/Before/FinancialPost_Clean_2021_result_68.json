            "inputText": "By Adam ZivoThe Conservative policy convention, which begins today, is going to be a test for Erin O'Toole, the newish leader of the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC). How he fares with this test will dictate not only his own political fortunes, but also the standing of conservatism in Canada for the next few years. To succeed, he'll have to define a compelling vision for the party. However, that means grappling with the simmering tensions between social and progressive conservatives, who, despite decades of co-existence within the big, blue tent of the CPC, haven't been able to reconcile their wildly different ideologies.Andrew Scheer, O'Toole's predecessor, wasn't up to this challenge. He tried to be everything to everyone, half-commiting to both sides. In doing so, he muddled his vision for Canada and pleased no one. His leadership lacked direction and a sense of trust. He paid the price for that electorally, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, and was unceremoniously ousted and forgotten.Will O'Toole make the same mistake? In some ways, he already has. During last year's leadership race, he tactically positioned himself as a social conservative, despite personally holding relatively progressive views. Within the CPC, social conservatives have become more influential and assertive over the past few years, such that winning party leadership now requires their support. However, once O'Toole had taken the party's reins, he shifted his politics back towards the centre. This was not a bad play. It's a time-honoured political tradition to moderate your views for general elections, but the problem lies in his lacklustre follow-through.Rather than being full-throated about his reorientation, O'Toole has mostly kept out of sight. As a party leader, he's been remarkably invisible, unknown. This is understandable, in a way. Why risk making unforced errors when you can sit back and let Trudeau absorb the heat for a botched vaccine rollout? In the absence of an active election, why inflame inter-party tensions by bringing them to the forefront, when you can quietly manage internal politics without too much scrutiny? Yet O'Toole's quietness, his ambiguity, risks positioning him as just another Scheer.Without knowing what O'Toole stands for, Canadians won't know what the Conservatives represent as a whole. That's a liability. A lack of trust is the greatest weakness of an incumbent government, intensified over the years as a party inevitably fails to live up to its promises and, complacent with its own power, allows itself to fall into corruption. By its final years, the Harper government had squandered public trust and was replaced by Trudeau's earnest optimism. Burdened by lofty promises, Trudeau quickly eroded trust through his failure to deliver on key promises, abetted by a steady parade of scandals. Successfully challenging a waning government requires putting forth a clear and trust-worthy vision for an alternative path, rather than relying on exhausting cynicism.O'Toole has so far failed to provide that vision. Instead, he's relied on anti-Trudeau resentment to unite and animate conservatives, betting that it can draw attention away from the CPC's factionalism. This is myopic. A party needs to identify itself by more than what it is not. Hence why the policy convention is crucial. It's the first major event where O'Toole can define both himself and the party in positive terms. Already, he's decisively moved to entrench progressive conservatism as the party's leading ideology. The policies being put forth at the convention are relatively tame, stripped of hardline social conservative causes. There isn't much that can be used to scare away undecided voters, no kindle for the opposing parties to set on fire. Given the unpopularity of hardline social conservative views within wider Canadian society, it's a success for O'Toole and his establishment allies.John Ivison: How Erin O'Toole allegedly sidelined Peter MacKay's plan to run in next election(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-ivison-how-erin-otoole-allegedly-sidelined-peter-mackays-plan-to-run-in-next-election)Ben Woodfinden: Why social conservatism is the only true conservatism(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-why-social-conservatism-is-the-only-true-conservatism)Politics is more than policy, though. O'Toole needs to proudly champion his beliefs, even if it means standing up to his base and calling attention to inconsistencies with his earlier campaigning. If he's already made his views clear in the cloistered world of party policy, then he should proudly advocate for those same views in other arenas.Why fight for a progressive conservative party, though? Some look solely towards electability, specifically the importance of being competitive in Canada's suburbs. That makes sense, but electoral calculations can't, by themselves, create a compelling national vision. Looking at the broader picture, it's important to consider how the Liberals' leftward lurch under Trudeau has created a gap in representation. There are many Canadians in the political centre who value tolerance and open-mindedness, but want an alternative to the performative wokeism of the Liberals and NDP. The CPC should grow to include them. This would create space for the pursuit of social justice in coexistence with other conservative values, such as pragmatism, individualism, and personal responsibility.Think of it as a clear-eyed, prudent progressivism - humane, but tough. In practice, that means continuing to make it clear to everyone that the abortion debate will not be reopened. It means ongoing support for a ban on gay conversion therapy, because all scientific evidence points to it as being torturous. It means supporting medically-assisted dying where it is merciful, while also being vigilant against abuse of that immense power. It means ensuring that free speech is protected on university campuses, while also recognizing that, yes, sometimes speech is abused with real harms. It means calmly addressing systemic racism while avoiding progressive saviour complexes. It's the common-sense pursuit of social good, mindful of costs and stripped of histrionics.A party like this would be one that would have the moral authority to govern, prioritizing the beliefs of the majority over an obstinate fringe. Perhaps it could even compel social conservatives to look inwards and adapt their views to be more appealing to broader society, rather than indulging their persecution complex. Does O'Toole want to govern and represent a wide swathe of Canadians, or stay beholden to voices that, if listened to, would risk turning the party into a fringe group that speaks for a specific minority, akin to the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois but without the neat, geographic boundaries? He's already shown that he knows the answer, but now he needs to champion it.Adam Zivo is a Toronto-based political analyst and the founder and director of the LoveisLoveisLove LGBTQ advocacy campaign.The big issues are far from settled.
