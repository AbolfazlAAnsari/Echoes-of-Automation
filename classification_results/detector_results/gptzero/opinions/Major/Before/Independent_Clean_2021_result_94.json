The Scottish Green Party led by Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater already ticks the box and backs Indyref2. They helped Nicola Sturgeon in her recent vote of confidence and Mr Harvie has been excellent in backing the complainants during the harassment fiasco. So vote for the principled Mr Harvie who will do all he can to save our planet or for Mr Salmond a man with an ego so big he refuses even now to apologise to those on the receiving end of his inappropriate behaviour.Paul MorrisonGlasgowCoronavirus ActI've obviously misunderstood. In my innocence, I thought thatthe Coronavirus Act, giving the government emergency powers, was necessary because laws might need to be made and enacted in a hurry as the pandemic progressed. But when they were trying to make up their mind about the first lockdown they took weeks to decide. And when they were going to quarantine people arriving in the UK from abroad, they gave 10 days warning, so a lot of travellers were able to beat the deadline. Parliament would have had time to debate and vote on both of those.So why did so many MPs vote to extend the emergency powers for another six months, when it achieves nothing useful? Seems like another power-grabbing opportunity for Boris Johnson.Susan AlexanderSouth Gloucestershire"
