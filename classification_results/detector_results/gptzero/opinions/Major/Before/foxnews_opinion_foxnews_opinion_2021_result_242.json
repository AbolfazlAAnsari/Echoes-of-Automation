You canâ€™t save all those starfish,â€™\" the pastor said.He steeled himself against the doubter before continuing: \"And the old man looked at him and said, you know what? You're right. But at least I can save this one.\"With that, the pastor pantomimed throwing a starfish far into the safety of the great sea.\"We may not be able to save everybody on the South Side of Chicago. We may not be able to impact everyoneâ€™s life,\" the pastor confided. \"But there are some people that we are going to reach. There are some lives that are going to be changed.\"\"And even if itâ€™s just that one little boy whoâ€™s without a father, that one little boy whoâ€™s looking for guidance, even if itâ€™s just that one little girl whose mom has been lost in the world and she finds herself troubled, trying to find her way, we will save just that one,\" the pastor continued.And that is a life that the doubters will never save.For more information, please visitProject H.O.O.D.Eli Steele is a documentary filmmaker and writer.
