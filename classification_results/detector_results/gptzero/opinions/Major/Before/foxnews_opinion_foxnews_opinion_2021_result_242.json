We may not be able to impact everyone’s life,\" the pastor confided. \"But there are some people that we are going to reach. There are some lives that are going to be changed.\"\"And even if it’s just that one little boy who’s without a father, that one little boy who’s looking for guidance, even if it’s just that one little girl whose mom has been lost in the world and she finds herself troubled, trying to find her way, we will save just that one,\" the pastor continued.And that is a life that the doubters will never save.For more information, please visitProject H.O.O.D.Eli Steele is a documentary filmmaker and writer.
