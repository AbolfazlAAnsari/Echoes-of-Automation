There’s some comfort in knowing that some things are not in our hands.\"Letting go isn’t easy for anyone, especially someone like Rush whose sheer grit and hard work helped him overcome years of personal and professional challenges. But when faced with his own mortality, he relinquished his grip and looked forward to eternity.Lunchtime workouts and errands in the car won’t be the same without my reliable radio companion. But in thinking of Rush’s promotion to Glory, I’m reminded of an old German poem, titled \"Leuchtende Tage\" – which translates into \"Bright Days\" or \"Radiant Days.\"\"Do not cry because they are past!\" the poet Ludwig Jacobowski wrote. \"Smile, because they once were!\"Rush Limbaugh used to somewhat jokingly refer to himself as, \"Talent on loan from God\" – a line that infuriated some, but a phrase that was theologically accurate. Each of us is uniquely gifted individuals, here for a season – all serving at God’s pleasure and timing.But all loans eventually come due – and Rush Limbaugh’s death is our loss, but Heaven’s gain.
