Sadly, Laura passed away after a seven-month wait for surgery.Stories like Laura's caused us to wonder: how many patients die each year in Canada while waiting for either life-saving surgery, like Laura's, or surgery that could improve their quality of life (e.g., hip or knee replacements)?The majority of hospitals and health regions responded by simply noting they don't track the data we sought. But 21 hospitals and health regions were able to provide us with at least some data (you can see all the responses at SecondStreet.org(https://www.secondstreet.org/2020/12/02/report-died-on-a-waiting-list/)). Together they cover roughly 40 per cent of Canada's population. Their numbers show that 1,480 patients died while waiting for surgery during the 2018-19 fiscal year.
