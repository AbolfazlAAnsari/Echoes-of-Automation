When the digital platforms denied their agreement on a voluntary code, a mandatory bargaining code became the best option. However, previous resistance now culminated in a coupled strategy. Whilst Google started closing one-to-one agreements with selected publishers for its News Showcase product, Facebook made its point through a news ban as ultima ratio, and with success. The deal that the Australian government and Facebook reached in the following bilateral negotiations undermines Australian regulatory attempts as Facebook is now exempted from the mandatory code if it reaches particular deals with some Australian media outlets.Just to be sure, this outcome is not a win-win situation. It weakens Australia's News Media Bargaining Code and will weaken every other regulatory attempt to follow. In fact, the Australian deal raises some major questions about why Facebook and Google can do what they do with an impact on legislative decision-making. Given the history of deals made between platform companies, governments, and publishers (France, for example, negotiated a one-time payment of Ã‚&;#8364;60 million with Google in 2013), the question is whether these deals are beneficial in the long run for the media companies they are trying to support? In fact, facilitating one-to-one agreements between digital platforms and publishers backs a \"divide-and-rule\" approach steered by the platforms.John Hinds: Canada must stand with Australia against Facebook and Google(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-hinds-canada-must-stand-with-australia-against-facebook-and-google)NP View: Facebook's Australian temper tantrum only proves it needs to be reined in(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/np-view-facebooks-australian-temper-tantrum-only-proves-it-needs-to-be-reined-in)In the long run, as digital platforms include mainly select big media companies in their bargaining interests, smaller news outlets will fall further behind. Interestingly, research(https://siepr.stanford.edu/research/publications/impact-aggregators-internet-news-consumption) from Susan Athey, Markus Mobius, and Jeno Pal found that when Google News shut down in Spain, the outlets mostly affected were small publishers, whilst big publishers seemed not significantly impacted. Consequently, big media companies can try to be more self-confident when negotiating with Google and Facebook because they might be more self-sufficient than believed. Small publishers, on the contrary, can assume to be left aside over time as they do not fit the platforms' profit-oriented portfolio. Hence, there will be no reliable partnership in the long run, anyway.Concluding from experience, instead of fostering competition between publishers with different conditions, interests and potential for being included in the platforms' portfolio, competition between digital platforms should be emphasized through governmental and publishers' efforts. Publishers should be able to diversify platform offers to disperse news bans' perceived risks in the future. However, so far, governments and publishers lack successful strategies when Facebook and Google remove news from their platforms.Reaching a better negotiating position will need collective structural efforts, some solidarity between news publishers, and the ability and self-confidence to take a risk. Former lukewarm attempts to build public (Europe) or publisher lead (France) digital news aggregators, which could offer some alternative to the big platforms in the news segment, all disappeared quickly, probably because other solutions like pay-off (France) and new regulations (Europe) seemed more sustainable and required less investment. However, alternative commercial or publicly supported offers could considerably strengthen both governments' and news publishers' negotiation powers in the future. The Australian case confirms that neither governments nor publishers nor news consumers should have to rely on Facebook and Google being the only kiosk owners in town.Dr. Sarah Anne Ganter is an Assistant Professor at Simon Fraser University's School of Communication. !@COPYRIGHT=Â© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
