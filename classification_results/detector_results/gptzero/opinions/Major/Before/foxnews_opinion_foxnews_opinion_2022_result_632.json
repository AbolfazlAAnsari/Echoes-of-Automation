It’s our job tovote for the candidateand the party whose policies will best contribute to the common good.'Vote Here' sign is seen at a Michigan voting precinct the day before Michigan Democrats and Republicans choose their nominees to contest November's congressional elections, which will determine which party controls U.S. House of Representatives for next two years, in Birmingham, Michigan, U.S. August 1, 2022. REUTERS/Emily Elconin(REUTERS/Emily Elconin)Leaders shape the values of a nation through the policies they enact. That means that Christians should work to select leaders who will govern according to God’s principles and seek to advance the cause of righteousness. This is an answer for the Christian who wants to avoid elections altogether.But to Christians who view elections as all-important, there’s a caution in order. Don’t forget that for a Christian, political change is not the ultimate goal. Politics is important because it can help us continue pursuing our true goals.The Christian’s highest callingis to show the light of Christ to the world. We do that by sharing the good news of God’s forgiveness which comes through faith in Jesus Christ. Earthly governments can either hinder or facilitate that proclamation.Theapostle Paulwrote in 1 Timothy 2 that we should pray for governing authorities to basically leave us alone and practice our faith.  In Paul’s day, all you could do was pray for civil authorities.  But today we have the opportunity to actually select leaders who will give us the freedom to practice our faith.Christians aren’t called to save America. We’re called to save Americans from God’s judgment by sharing the good news of Christ’s forgiveness.So, yes, Christians have both the right and responsibility to vote in this election.  But remember why you’re doing it and what ultimate purpose voting serves.What America needs most is not a politician or a party. We need a genuine spiritual revival that only God can bring.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR. ROBERT JEFFRESSGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
