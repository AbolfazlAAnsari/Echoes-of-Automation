Not to mention the effect on a very active dog.Could it be that this knee-jerk measure is as a result of the realisation that the original plan of triaging to give the benefit of scarce medical resources to the younger, more productive patients will mean the potential deaths of the Tory (and Brexit leaning) core voters? I do not underestimate the seriousness of this pandemic but the over seventies will have lived to survive Asian flu, Hong Kong flu, Sars and the many other serious outbreaks over the last 70 years. We deserve, ironically, to be treated as adults.I do hope, however, that should this proposed measure be introduced and enforced, The Independent will publish the photograph of me resisting arrest and being thrown into a police van by burly coppers for continuing to walk my dog.Kate Hall                                            LeedsSocial engineeringBoris Johnson's government remains unique in its strategy towards the coronavirus crisis in that its policy is to allow the contagion to run its course through the population in the hope that survivors will acquire a \"herd immunity\" to Covid-19 and future manifestations of the virus. This strategy is based on the expectation that some 53 million people in the UK will be infected.Boris Johnson understands this approach risks the lives of the oldest and most vulnerable in society and has warned the public they should prepare to \"lose loved ones before their time\".Incidentally, Johnson is also unique in employing a number of advisers who have faith in the racist pseudo-science of eugenics.Last month Andrew Sabisky resigned his position as a government adviser when his enthusiasm for forcing long-term contraception on working-class women to avoid the production of a \"permanent underclass\" came to light.Boris Johnson's senior aide Dominic Cummings has demonstrated eugenicist tendencies of his own, having previously argued in favour of the selective breeding of human beings.Johnson's government are letting Covid-19 rip through the population in the knowledge its victims will be the old and the weak.These two phenomena are surely not unconnected.Sasha Simic                                            Stamford HillWestern unrestThe coronavirus outbreak has shed light on the multiple fault lines and shortcomings of European health systems that were unprepared for such colossal contagion. Countries like Jordan, Lebanon and even the occupied Palestinian territories, where the budget deficit runs into billions, have proven more resilient and resolute in responding to this outbreak than those such as Germany, Italy, France, Spain and even the UK, where Johnson et al have brazenly advocated for \"herd community\" - a callous scheme to wipe out the elderly and vulnerable.Dr Munjed Farid Al Qutobâ                                            Northwest London"
