            "inputText": "President Joe Biden's recent nomination and appointment, respectively, of superstar scholars Lina Khan(https://twitter.com/linamkhan?lang=en) to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Tim Wu(https://twitter.com/superwuster) to work on technology and competition policy at the National Economic Council(https://www.whitehouse.gov/nec/ ) have reignited optimism that the United States government will finally take action against Big Tech giants like Google and Facebook for their anti-competitive behaviour. Why isn't Canada taking a similar approach?In 2019, the Competition Bureau assured Canadians that it was \"monitoring\"(https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/07/24/canadas-competition-bureau-monitoring-tech-giants-for-anti-competitive-behaviour.html) the tech giants for anti-competitive practices. Since then, it launched an investigation into Amazon(https://www.canada.ca/en/competition-bureau/news/2020/08/competition-bureau-seeks-input-from-market-participants-to-inform-an-ongoing-investigation-of-amazon.html). But when compared to other competition authorities, like the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FTC in the U.S. and the European Commission, the Competition Bureau's enforcement in the digital sphere has been lacking.Since 2011, the Competition Bureau has launched five modest investigations into the FAANGs: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. In that same time, authorities in the U.S. and the European Union have launched nearly double and triple that amount, respectively.As far as we know, the Competition Bureau has never investigated Facebook's anti-competitive practices, although it did fine the social media giant $9 million for its misleading privacy claims(https://www.canada.ca/en/competition-bureau/news/2020/05/facebook-to-pay-9-million-penalty-to-settle-competition-bureau-concerns-about-misleading-privacy-claims.html) last year.That same year, the European Commission and the FTC initiated serious actions against Facebook. The FTC filed an abuse of dominance case with the aim of having Facebook divest itself of Instagram and Whatsapp, which Facebook acquired in 2012 and 2014, respectively. Meanwhile, sources suggest that right now, the European Commission is investigating whether Facebook leveraged its access to user data to stifle competition.Canadian, American and European authorities all brought cases against Apple for its agreement with book publishers to fix the price of ebooks. In addition to this, the European Commission recently opened investigations into Apple's App Store, Apple Pay(https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1075) and its music streaming service(https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2019-002996_EN.html). Canada was investigating Apple at one point, but closed the investigation(https://fortune.com/2017/01/06/apple-canada/) in 2017.Google, the most investigated FAANG of them all, has been subject to only one investigation by Canadian authorities. In contrast, the FTC and DOJ have taken action against Google at least three times, as has the European Commission. In total, the European Commission has fined Google a total of 3.91-billion euros ($5.3 billion) since 2011. Canada has never issued any fines or other monetary penalties.In 2016, the Competition Bureau quietly closed(https://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/04066.html) its only investigation into Google. However, it did lead Google to voluntarily drop language from its AdWords API terms and conditions, so that they would be in line with an agreement that the online advertising giant made with the FTC.The Competition Bureau's investigation into Google shows the benefit of following the lead of U.S. antitrust authorities. But the bureau cannot be as forceful as its peers in the U.S. and Europe because it is fundamentally hamstrung.Our competition laws are different than our international peers, particularly Europe. Under Canadian law, the Competition Bureau must meet a much higher legal standard to successfully make a case against the tech giants, or any other firm for that matter.For example, when the Competition Bureau takes an abuse of dominance case, as many of these tech cases are, it must show that the firm's problematic behaviour has caused \"a substantial lessening or prevention of competition.\" But in the EU, authorities only have to show that the conduct is \"capable of having, or is likely to have, anti-competitive effects.\"In other words, the Canadian standard requires proof that the firm's conduct reduced competition, or is likely to do so, whereas the European Commission typically only has to show that the conduct has the potential to be anti-competitive.The effect of these differences in law can be seen in how authorities have dealt with Google's shopping service. In its investigation, the European Commission found that Google(https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_17_1784) \"systematically (gave) prominent placement to its own comparison shopping service\" and \"demoted rival comparison shopping services in its search results.\" In 2017, it fined Google 2.42-billion euros.In contrast, Canada's investigation(https://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/04066.html) into biased Google search results and the company's preferential treatment of its own services ultimately found that there was insufficient evidence to show that these behaviours excluded rivals or caused a \"substantial lessening or prevention of competition.\" Acknowledging that the facts of the case may differ between the EU and Canada, the rationales used by each of the authorities is telling.Both the DOJ and FTC can undertake \"market studies(https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/us-submissions-oecd-2010-present-other-international-competition-fora/market_studies_us.pdf)\" to \"develop a deeper understanding of sectors and business practices.\" Importantly, the FTC and DOJ can legally compel businesses to provide sensitive, internal business information for these studies. This information is critical for understanding how their business practices have evolved and, ultimately, identifying potential anti-competitive conduct.In Canada, the Competition Bureau does not have this power. The only way it can compel information from businesses is if it is undertaking a formal inquiry. To get a company's data, the bureau must get a court order. And to get that kind of order, the bureau must provide some evidence that the behaviour it wants to investigate has already occurred.This prevents the bureau from monitoring the digital landscape for anti-competitive conduct. If the Competition Bureau had the power to get information from businesses outside the context of a formal investigation, like authorities in the U.S. can, perhaps it would be more proactive.The ability of American authorities to launch thorough investigations has often led to speedy action being taken against tech companies. In February 2020, the FTC announced(https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/02/ftc-examine-past-acquisitions-large-technology-companies) that it was doing a review of mergers undertaken by the largest digital companies, including Facebook. By December, it filed its suit(https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization) against Facebook, asserting that its acquisitions of Instagram and Whatsapp were anti-competitive.In July 2019, the DOJ launched(https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-reviewing-practices-market-leading-online-platforms) its own sweeping investigation into the anti-competitive practices of leading online platforms and, about a year later, brought a case against Google. Adding to these investigations is the in-depth probe undertaken by the House judiciary committee, which culminated in a 450-page report released late last year. No doubt the findings of the report have informed recent actions taken by American competition authorities.Our country's outdated laws preclude our government from taking meaningful steps that could protect Canadian consumers from the dominance of Big Tech firms like Google and Facebook. The apparent ineffectiveness of our laws in the digital sphere highlights the pressing need for reform. To that end, it was recently reported(https://financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/competition-bureau-backs-review-of-antitrust-laws-amid-scrutiny-of-grocers?utm_term=Autofeed&;utm_medium=Social&;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1615592890) that the House of Commons standing committee on industry, science and technology is launching a study of the country's competition rules in April.While Canada may benefit from being a second mover when it comes to applying the Competition Act to digital economies, there are structural limitations in our legislation that hinder our ability to curb anti-competitive practices and put us at a disadvantage compared to other developed countries. Without substantive legislative reform, we can do little more than watch and learn from our international peers.National PostVass Bednar is the executive director of McMaster University's master of public policy in digital society program.
