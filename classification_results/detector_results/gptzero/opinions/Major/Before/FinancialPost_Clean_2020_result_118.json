            "inputText": "On Dec. 3, the Trudeau government introduced Bill C-15 into Parliament to bring the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) into Canadian law. It sounds like a great idea: why not have Canada join 147 other countries in adopting the UN's minimum standards for recognizing the rights of Indigenous peoples. But it's not a great idea. For Canada, UNDRIP is a step backwards. Its introduction into Canadian law is likely to cause costly legal confusion in return for no real benefit to Indigenous peoples or anyone else except maybe lawyers.Bill C-15 requires the government to ensure that the laws of Canada are \"consistent with UNDRIP.\" Indigenous Canadians have had better rights protection than provided in UNDRIP since Pierre Trudeau gave us the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 38 years ago. These Charter rights were expanded by federal and provincial human rights legislation. And there have been many judicial decisions requiring extensive Crown consultation with Indigenous peoples prior to approval of projects that may affect them. Indeed, inadequate consultation has already resulted in the courts setting aside Cabinet approval of two major projects. We didn't need UNDRIP in 2007 and we don't need it now. Our laws are already consistent with, and better than UNDRIP. In fact, if Justin Trudeau wanted to exhibit international leadership in reducing unfairness to Indigenous peoples, why not encourage the UN to update UNDRIP to make it consistent with Canadian laws, such as our Charter, the Canada Human Rights Act and the judicial decisions creating a duty of consultation? Better that the rest of the world move forward than Canada backward.If UNDRIP is redundant, why is everyone so keen on making it part of Canadian law? Because they either haven't read it carefully or haven't understood it. Many First Nations and government officials mistakenly believe that UNDRIP requires the \"free, prior and informed consent\" (FPIC) of Indigenous peoples to any proposed resource project. That is wrong; UNDRIP doesn't say that anywhere. In its section 32 it says: \"States shall consult and co-operate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their lands or territories and other resources, particularly in connection with the development, utilization or exploitation of mineral, water or other resources.\"Brian Schmidt: UNDRIP is good but Canada needs a better way to implement it(https://financialpost.com/opinion/brian-schmidt-undrip-is-good-but-canada-needs-a-better-way-to-implement-it)Jack M. Mintz: One carbon strategy is enough(https://financialpost.com/opinion/jack-m-mintz-one-carbon-strategy-is-enough)Learn the science before you follow it: Fact-checking Justin Trudeau on climate change(https://financialpost.com/opinion/learn-the-science-before-you-follow-it-fact-checking-justin-trudeau-on-climate-change)But the only duty here (and in the similarly worded section 19) is to consult and co-operate in good faith. If that consultation succeeds, the result will be FPIC. However, success depends on the co-operation of all parties. If, despite fulfilling the duty of consultation, there is no FPIC, there is no further duty to obtain it.If UNDRIP had intended to create the duty to obtain FPIC it would have said: \"States shall obtain the free and informed consent of indigenous peoples prior to approval of any project affecting them.\" Instead, it said \"States shall consult and co-operate ... .\" The word \"shall\" applies to \"consult and co-operate,\" not to \"obtain.\" UNDRIP is therefore consistent with several Supreme Court of Canada decisions holding that First Nations do not have a veto over government project approval decisions made after consultation.Justice Minister David Lametti's assurance that there will be no veto suggests the government will not legislate a new duty to obtain FPIC into either sections 32 or 19. If so, why have Bill C-15 at all? Is it just to keep an unnecessary election promise? Or is its intention to introduce new laws that are consistent with but go beyond UNDRIP and even our existing laws?C-15 tries to solve a nonexistent problem. No Canadian law says \"the government may discriminate unfairly against Indigenous peoples.\" The problem is not with our laws as written, but with our laws as they are applied and enforced, which may indeed be unfairly discriminatory. But that means that instead of paying legions of federal lawyers to spend hundreds of person-years studying a library of laws for no practical benefit, we should deal with the impacts of the laws as applied in practice.For example, many First Nations lack employment opportunities and are thus condemned to living on government largesse. C-15 may or may not give them new legal rights but even if it does, you can't sue yourself into a job. In fact, by making it appear to be easier for one First Nation to shut down a pipeline project that will provide training and jobs to many other First Nations, C-15 may reduce their economic opportunities even further. That's a problem, not a solution.The legal rights of Canada's Indigenous peoples are set out in a large body of constitutional and human rights law, both federal and provincial. If Parliament now enacts some of these same rights again, using the same language as in existing laws, it will have achieved nothing. But if it uses different language, that will engender years of costly constitutional litigation to clarify what, if anything, Parliament intended to add to Indigenous peoples' established rights. That's another problem, not a solution.If UNDRIP won't make a legal difference, then Canada's Indigenous peoples don't need it. If it does make a difference, one that causes years of harmful legal confusion, then Canada's Indigenous peoples shouldn't want it.Parliament should focus on real solutions to real problems, not on legislation that feels good but doesn't actually do good.Andrew Roman is a retired litigation lawyer. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.
