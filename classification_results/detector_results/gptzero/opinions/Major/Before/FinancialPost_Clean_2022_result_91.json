While the pandemic was an accelerant, the underlying problem isn't new; the supply of housing hasn't kept up with demand. There is no shortage of scapegoats including foreign buyers, house flippers and private equity companies buying single-family homes. But at the end of the day, government-imposed restrictions on development have prevented the market from providing enough housing for current and future Ontarians. Finally, Queen's Park appears to be taking meaningful action.According to confidential documents(https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/2022/10/20/doug-ford-will-override-municipal-zoning-to-allow-more-housing-across-ontario-confidential-document-reveals.html) obtained by the Toronto Star, the Ford government plans to table legislation featuring sweeping changes to land-use planning provincewide. Among the most promising changes, Queen's Park reportedly plans to override municipal zoning rules to allow duplexes and triplexes on single-family lots across Ontario. They are also proposing to curb the role of conservation agencies, waive site-plan control for smaller developments and reduce the number of public meetings required, as well as the possibility for appeals.These changes echo recommendations from the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force(https://files.ontario.ca/mmah-housing-affordability-task-force-report-en-2022-02-07-v2.pdf), which called for allowing even more density \"as-of-right\" (without rezoning) in single-family neighbourhoods. The government already committed to several recommendations, but this was a hard one. While they appear not to be going quite as far as the panel suggested, this could be a serious step forward.To understand why something like this needs to be done, you need to go back to 2005. The McGuinty government introduced the Places To Grow Act, intended to curb the outward expansion of Greater Toronto and its outlying areas. In doing so, the province essentially assumed municipalities would allow enough homes to be built in existing urban areas, to compensate for reduced outward growth. They didn't.Yes, Toronto and other cities experienced a condo boom, but that wasn't nearly enough. There are only so many parcels of land zoned or otherwise slotted for condo towers in official plans. So the Greater Toronto Area growth model has largely been restricted to building as many towers as possible in already dense areas. Meanwhile, 70 per cent of the city of Toronto's residential areas remained off-limits to anything other than detached houses.Opinion: Canada needs more rental housing, but the feds might make it harder to build(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-canada-needs-more-rental-housing-but-the-feds-might-make-it-harder-to-build)Adam Zivo: Is the City of Toronto giving young homebuyers the middle finger?(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/adam-zivo-is-the-city-of-toronto-giving-young-homebuyers-the-middle-finger)While this wasn't the only barrier to development, it made it difficult to add low-cost, incremental housing in much of the city. Building walk-up apartments and townhouses can be much cheaper per unit than condo buildings that require elevators and parking. So we weren't able to build enough housing, let alone enough low-cost housing. Hence the gravity-defying price increases of the past decade.To their credit, both Queen's Park and the City of Toronto have already taken steps in the right direction. The province has sought to streamline development charges(https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/019-0181) and update growth planning(https://www.ontario.ca/page/growth-plan-greater-golden-horseshoe-2019-order-council-6412019), with varying levels of success. The municipality, for its part, has reduced(https://www.toronto.ca/news/city-council-approves-changes-to-regulations-for-car-and-bike-parking-spaces-in-new-developments/) cumbersome parking requirements and expanded the areas allowing garden suites on single-family properties. But it is still limiting the bulk of the density permitted to a few pockets. Worse, it is doing so as the province is undertaking a generational investment in public transit infrastructure. So we're not only not building enough, and not building cheap enough, but we're also not building enough to justify the cost of transportation projects we (taxpayers) are all funding. Something has to give.The optics of the province bringing down the hammer on the cities right after the municipal elections may not be great. But it's been a long time coming. Cities have no plan to build nearly enough housing, and city councils can face horrible obstacles. A small group of vocal homeowners can make city councillors think twice about approving new housing. So even if, in theory, city council wants to allow more housing, every city councillor has an incentive to ensure that it's in someone else's ward - or another city.Premier Ford has a mandate to represent the entire province - not just people currently living in any particular city or ward - and he is using it. If the reports are true, this could be a legacy achievement for the government. But the devil will be in the details.National PostSteve Lafleur is a public policy analyst and Josef Filipowicz is an urban policy specialist. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
