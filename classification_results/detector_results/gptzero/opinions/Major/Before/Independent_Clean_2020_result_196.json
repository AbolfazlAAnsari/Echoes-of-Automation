On the other hand, travel was more difficult whereas now we can be at the other end of the country in a few hours and on the other side of the world within 24 hours. So the idea that we are on top of the virus and that restrictions can be lifted by the autumn may prove optimistic despite the soothing words from government.We should maybe ponder how we will protect ourselves for the long haul and an inexorable culling of the population and the economy if that is what lies ahead.Ian Hurdley                                          FerndownDomestic HellcationWe are being urged to holiday at home as it is safe and will support small businesses. I thought I was happy to do so, trying to book a countryside cottage in Northumberland with a couple of days city break tagged on. We would be driving ourselves.I am staggered by two things. One is the cost - why do three days in a cottage cost more than a week could in Greece or Spain? In Europe, breakfast would be included. Second and possibly more important, I'm staggered by the approach of the British businesses I have encountered. They are rude and unhelpful, even if you spend an hour waiting to speak to a person on the phone. I have been told I have to wait to confirm a booking I have booked and paid for online, so cannot make other arrangements until this happens. I have had an internet booking cancelled after confirmation and paying in full.I have so far spent close to £1,000 for six days of accommodation, split between hotels and self-catering. That does not include any travelling or food. The stress associated with getting this far has been high. Is it a surprise I feel ripped off?Anna Taylor                                          Sunbury-on-ThamesStaycation pleaseNo trips to Spain for us in Scotland whilst the quarantine rule applies. I agreeValencia is an amazing destinationwith culture, amazing food and beaches but it's not a viable option for us at the moment.Whist I agree with most of Nicola Sturgeon's leadership decisions, the inconsistent application of scientific reasoning meant that Spain as a whole country was not deemed \"safe\" whilst areas such as the Balearics were much less Covid-impacted. The result will mean more pain for Spanish tourism and less travel options for Scots. It's a small frustration I know - however, with hope a rare commodity, it was a small ray!Eileen McCulloch                                          Address supplied"
