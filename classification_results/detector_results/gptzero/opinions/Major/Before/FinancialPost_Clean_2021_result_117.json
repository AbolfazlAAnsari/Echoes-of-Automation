The percentage of Canadians with incomes below the poverty line has fallen in half since 1996. To what do we credit this impressive achievement?A poverty line defines a level of income below which a person or household with that income is considered to be experiencing poverty. The Low-Income Cut-Off (LICO) is one of the oldest poverty lines in use in Canada, providing us with data back to 1976. It's not a perfect measure. It considers people to be in \"straitened circumstances\" if they spend 20 percentage points more of their income on food, clothing and shelter than the median Canadian family does, which is arbitrary. On the other hand, that it has been calculated for such a long time makes it useful for showing long-term trends. Statistics Canada uses a version of the LICO that measures poverty after accounting for income transfers. Though Statistics Canada never referred to the LICO as \"the poverty rate\" most Canadians have always thought of it that way.Economic growth generates an amount of income identified as gross domestic product, or GDP. When divided by population, this income is expressed as GDP per capita and measures the average amount of income available to each Canadian. Adjusting for inflation, it measures how the purchasing power of the average Canadian has changed over time. Real GDP per capita tends to grow over time though there are occasional periods of recession when it shrinks.In the figure, each dot identifies real GDP per capita and the percentage of the population experiencing poverty for a given year. For example, in 1976 real GDP per capita was $31,600 and the poverty rate was 13 per cent. By 2019, real GDP per capita had increased by 77 per cent to nearly $56,000 and the rate of poverty had fallen in half to 6.5 per cent. Periods of recession saw real GDP per capita fall between 1981 to 1983, again between 1989 to 1993 and one last time between 2009 and 2011. During the first two of these periods, the poverty rate increased sharply. The 2008-09 recession had a more modest effect on the poverty rate. Outside these periods of recession, real per capita GDP increased and the poverty rate fell.Matthew Lau: More equal?

Indeed, the sharp decline in poverty since 2015 following significant increases in child benefits and big increases in many provincial minimum wages, a decline that occurred despite slow income growth, suggests just that. While these policies have certainly helped lower poverty in Canada, the correlation re-emphasizes well-known findings from less developed countries about the importance of economic growth in reducing poverty by creating employment opportunities and generating the revenue governments need to fund income support programs. The data in the chart suggest that, just as in less developed countries, Canadian public policies that fail to promote economic growth may impact those at the low end of the income distribution most keenly.Ron Kneebone is scientific director of social policy and health research at the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary.
