Contrast that with those in the GOP who want to take the United States back to a time where women didn't have reproductive freedom, books were banned and worse.On Friday, DeSantis signed a bill known as the \"Stop W.O.K.E Act,\" which will likely curtailacademic freedomby not allowing instructors to teach about slavery in a way that will \"persuade students to a particular point of view.\" How can you not teach about slavery in way that persuades students it was evil?As The Washington Postreportedin February, the real-world impact of similar GOP-enacted laws have resulted in a less robust education on topics of race and Black history. Teachers have reported having to \"edit\" themselves because of fear of running afoul of these oppressive laws. \"Are you willing to lose your job over this kind of thing?\" one teacher in Texas told the paper.A report in The New York Times detailed how an Oklahoma teacher was concerned of being fired for using the word \"white\"to describe people who fought to preserve slavery. It appears GOP-led legislatures want to rewrite history by teaching slavery in a colorblind way, keeping students ignorant about such issues.I'm not saying Democrats should ignore \"kitchen table issues\" -- especially given that inflation has a real impact on people's lives. But there's no easy way to address that issue. There is when it comes to extremism.Many of today's Republicans are not just talking about punishing those who defy them; they are enacting laws that do just that. Democrats not only have a winning political argument but an obligation to stand up against such an onslaught. They may be the only thing standing between us and tyranny.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
