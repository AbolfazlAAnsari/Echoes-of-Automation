Similarly, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama and Melania Trump took trips overseas to assist their husbands in promoting their political agendas during their respective presidencies.First ladies also have been integral to political campaigns. In the fall of 1964, Lady Bird Johnsontook a 1,628 mile-tourof eight southern states, meeting with political leaders and speaking in support of Lyndon B. Johnson's record -- even when she encountered crowds who were livid about her husband's signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.Michelle Obama was one of the most clear-eyed and vocal critics of Donald Trump's campaign in 2016, offering some of the most powerful speeches and commentary about the stakes that the nation faced with the prospect of him winning office. And at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, shetore into Trumpas someone who was \"clearly in over his head.\"First ladies have played critical roles in policymaking deliberations. In 1993, President Bill Clintonnamed Hillary Clintonto be the head of the task force that designed his health care plan. Predictably, she became the vicious target of conservative attacks and mockery in the media, which spoke of her in terms comparable to that of Eleanor Roosevelt. During the health care fight,one cartoonfeatured Clinton sitting in a high chair, hovering over her husband in the Oval Office, as one adviser whispers to the other: \"It still unnerves me a bit.\" Although the plan went down in defeat, Clinton's work helped put forth a new model of health care reform thatbecame a foundationfor the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act.First ladies have also become champions of significant causes. Lady Bird Johnson was awell-known advocateof the environment and highway beautification. Betty Ford was a strong supporter of theEqual Rights Amendment, which brought her into direct conflict with right-wing activists like Phyllis Schlaflywho were mobilizingto defeat it. Meanwhile, Nancy Reaganfamously campaignedagainst drug use, telling the nation's youth to \"Just Say No.\"And, of course, first ladies can serve as advisers, sometimes in dramatic fashion -- such as in 1919 when Edith Wilsonsecretly stepped upafter her husband Woodrow Wilson suffered from a debilitating stroke.What's clear from history is that first ladies have consistently found ways to use their positions to influence public life -- even in the wake of sexism and bigotry. And each time a first lady, such as Jill Biden, currently on her trip to reaffirm US support of Ukraine, takes a role in addressing the challenges of our times, they help build a stronger precedent for a future where the country will not just accept but expect the spouse of the commander-in-chief to use their position to improve American lives.Opinion by Julian Zelizer, CNN Political AnalystTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
