            "inputText": "By Dr. P.G. Forest and Dr. Jason SutherlandIf COVID-19 breaks out in Canada, hospitals will have to move quickly to make thousands of beds available to people affected by the virus. Hospitals will be able to accommodate those made critically ill by COVID-19 only by removing many patients to the community and sharing capacity between hospitals at local, regional and even possibly, at national levels.The World Health Organization says that countries should be prepared for a global pandemic, meaning a worldwide spread of the virus. With already over 80,000 cases and an estimated case fatality rate of over 2.0 per cent, the impact on health, wellness and the economy is significant in countries with important clusters of cases and those that have latent cases.China, as the epicentre of this new pathogen, has been hit particularly hard. Conservative statistics indicate that between 11 and 18 per cent of people known to have contracted the virus have developed serious or critical medical conditions. With over 77,000 cases, this means China is contending with well over 8,000 unanticipated hospitalizations for the treatment of illnesses due to COVID-19. Given the expected burden to the health systems, there is little wonder why health officials built a hospital with 1,000 beds in seven days.If an outbreak occurs in a metropolitan area, given the virus's transmission patterns coupled with few safeguards to limit the virus's spread, tens or hundreds of thousands of cases may be presumed to require immediate medical attention as well as safe monitoring. An outbreak in Ottawa, for example, with points of egress in all directions, including into neighbouring Quebec, may generate as many as 10,000 cases among the city's residents in the first two months.Based on what is known so far, between 12 per cent and 18 per cent of cases might require hospitalization, if not intensive care, for periods from 10 days to two weeks, potentially more at the beginning of the outbreak as health-care workers learn and deploy safe protocols.The Canadian Institute for Health Information reported that, in the spring of 2018, there was capacity of just over 73,000 hospital beds in Canada, noting that statistics are not available for Quebec. Almost all of these beds are already occupied and the speed of response needed for a new epidemic could overwhelm even best-managed hospitals.The federal government has little sway to generate capacity in province's hospitals even in national emergencies. So, an epidemic will focus on provinces' and decentralized regions' responses to the outbreak. Unlike China, building a hospital - or more than one - within a week may be beyond a province's ability to treat affected Canadians needing urgent care.A woman wears a surgical mask in Vancouver amid fears over the COVID-19 coronavirus.Provinces have many hospitals beds currently occupied by patients who are ready to leave but cannot, possibly due to having nowhere to go because of symptoms of advanced disorders or absence of able caregiver in the home. A chronic problem across all provinces, Health Quality Ontario reports that over 15 per cent of Ontario's hospital's beds are filled with patients \"ready to go home.\"The best option to make space for people with severe symptomology of COVID-19 is to move out patients whom may not need the intensity of care provided in hospitals.Given what we can safely anticipate will be a huge stress on the capacity of our health workers and hospitals, it is preferable that patients are discharged to home. For others not yet ready to return home, long-term care beds will need to be rapidly found. This presents challenges for most provinces, with wait lists for long-term care beds a common occurrence.For others, hospital beds will need to be found among other hospitals. Co-ordination between hospitals at this speed will be a barrier, as the scale of moving hundreds of patients between hospitals, and away from the epicentre, will be fast. These complex and expensive moves alone may not open a sufficient number of beds. Then, provinces will need to move patients to hospitals in other provinces, a level of co-ordination that provinces have never experienced.Provinces' silo-based health-care delivery systems would need to behave in ways they haven't before in order to avoid premature death and suffering among people affected by a COVID-19 outbreak. Last week, the federal minister of health, Patty Hajdu, reassured Canadians she has a plan. But her government, more than any other, knows that a plan is worth nothing if there is no one to guide or to direct, and the resources to execute.This rapid reallocation of hospital capacity and expertise is not an easy task. Today, we already have crowded emergency departments around the country and hospital beds occupied by patients whom are better served in other settings.A national task force assembled under the leadership of the Public Health Agency of Canada should be quickly established whose objective is to prepare and give advice and support to local, regional and provincial authorities to make room in hospitals. Moving patients or imagining how to swap hospital beds between jurisdictions cannot be done under pressure, when decision-makers are looking for equipment, keeping their professionals safe and minimizing the impact of the virus. The federal government should also commit to compensating provinces for health-care costs in advance of the hospital bed crisis to avoid dithering and improvisation. Canadian epidemiologist Bruce Aylward, back from leading the World Health Organization mission to study the COVID-19 outbreak in China, said it well: \"Are we ready? No! We'll never be ready. But we have to be as ready as possible.\"Dr. P.G. Forest is with the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary.
