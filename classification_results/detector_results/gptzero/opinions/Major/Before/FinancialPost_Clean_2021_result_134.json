It speaks to the very reason(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3019781) that then-premiers Allan Blakeney and Peter Lougheed (and not Justice Minister Jean ChrÃ©tien or Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau) insisted on including the notwithstanding clause in the charter: it allows democratically elected legislatures to disagree with courts about the scope and meaning of charter rights.Laws may be enacted notwithstanding certain provisions of the charter for renewable, five-year periods, thereby making them immune to substantive review by the courts. That means the notwithstanding clause offers ordinary citizens who vote for the representatives some slim measure of input over disagreements about most of the vague rights that are enumerated in the charter.Complaints about the notwithstanding clause range from bizarre invocations of the \"original intent(https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/the-real-problem-with-quebecs-new-language-bill/)\" of the framers who opposed the clause (ChrÃ©tien and Trudeau), to the idea that its use is always \"indefensible(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-canadian-charters-notwithstanding-clause-is-increasingly/).\" But contrary to what critics claim, the notwithstanding clause actually reflects a political culture and history that has sought to correct the democratic dangers of having reasonable disagreements about rights settled exclusively in the courts.Section 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867, states that, \"The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada.\" Notice that while the Constitution is explicit about its supremacy, there is no mention of courts having an exclusive interpretive role.Courts certainly serve as guardians of the Constitution, but who guards the guardians? Our framers included democratic socialists like Blakeney and conservatives like Lougheed(https://www.constitutionalstudies.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lougheed.pdf), who may have disagreed about many rights questions, but agreed that legislatures have an interpretive role to play, alongside the courts, in the interpretation of charter rights. These premiers drafted Section 33 to explicitly recognize this role.This doesn't mean that there shouldn't be political standards for evaluating when legislatures ought to invoke Section 33. On the contrary, the notwithstanding clause should be reserved for legislative disagreements with the judicial interpretation of laws concerning important questions of how rights relate to public policy.Perhaps the best illustration of this was Saskatchewan's 2018 invocation of Section 33 to protect public funding for non-Catholic students at Catholic schools. A trial court held that extending state funding to non-Catholics at historically state-supported Catholic schools violated the charter's protection of religious neutrality. The province held the reasonable view that extending funding this way actually made historically protected funding for Catholic schools more neutral, and said exactly that in the preamble of the legislation invoking the notwithstanding clause.Laws that properly invoke the notwithstanding clause need not meet judicial standards of justification precisely because they are meant to be justified to Canadian citizens as reasonable protections for rights. Ontario's invocation provokes an interesting consideration of this point. Gerald Butts, a critic of Section 33, tweeted: \"make no mistake, if one Premier gets away with overriding the Charter on campaign finance, the flood gates will open. We'll have US style Super PACs faster than you can say Citizens United.\"This is a silly thing to say because the bill in question, Bill 254, is designed precisely to ensure that American-style PAC spending doesn't happen in Ontario. Conservative MPP Lindsey Park tweeted(https://twitter.com/lparkpc/status/1402709816443875335), \"This is about individual voters in Ontario deciding the result of elections not American-style super PACs.\" And a Globe and Mail editorial stated(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-doug-ford-is-right-about-limiting-third-party-political-spending-and/): \"Doug Ford is right about limiting third-party political spending, and dead wrong about how to do it.\" If Ford's policy is in the space of reasonable disagreement, then it's hard to see why citizens and their elected representatives should not be free to debate whether it imposes reasonable limits on the scope of charter rights.One can criticize the rushed timing of the legislation, which may apply these rules to Ontario's next election. But that does not invalidate the legislation's clearly reasonable limit on freedom of expression. One can even substantively disagree with Ontario's decision to use the clause and think that it is perfectly democratic for the legislature to have some say over how freedom of expression relates to limits on third-party campaign spending six months prior to an election.The notwithstanding clause is not a poison pill that undermines Canadian democracy. The clause ensures our legislatures can play an active role in protecting and defining charter rights. That is something we should welcome as democratic citizens.Peter L.
