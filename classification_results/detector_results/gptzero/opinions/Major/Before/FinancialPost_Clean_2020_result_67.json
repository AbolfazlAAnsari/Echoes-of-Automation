            "inputText": "By Harry RakowskiTruth or Consequences was an American game show originally hosted on radio and later on television, which ran from 1940 to 1988. The show asked contestants questions they had to answer correctly or suffer the consequences, typically having to perform a zany stunt. The questions were phrased in such a way that it was very difficult to get them right, and Beulah the Buzzer would sound when there had been a wrong answer, with a penalty to follow.Today, being able to speak truth to power without suffering the consequences is a key element of democracy. It is the role of a free press to report it, and the right of a people whose freedom of speech is enshrined in our Constitution. In Hong Kong, Russia, Turkey or North Korea, speaking truth to power may lead to imprisonment, exile or even death. The suppression of this freedom is an essential need of totalitarian governments and leaders afraid of the truth and secure that they can contain the consequences.Why is it that in Canada, our prime minister has not yet learned the consequences of failing to speak the truth, or of ignoring the truths spoken to him that he does not want to hear? When polls are taken as to which professionals are trusted the most, politicians are usually near the bottom of the list. We grudgingly accept that promises made to win elections are conveniently ignored, and that decisions that are made almost always have a political filter that ensures the right optics and wins future votes. So why do Justin Trudeau's recent actions not rise above this already low bar that we set for our political leaders?In Ontario, Doug Ford had a rocky start as a new premier, with low approval ratings. His response to COVID-19 has been exemplary, receiving praise from both supporters and those who disliked or underestimated him. He has combined sincerity, humility and a truthful manner of telling it like it is, to demonstrate what responsible governing is all about. He spends your money like it is his money. The consequence is that his popularity and support have climbed dramatically.Trudeau has managed to waste the initial praise he received for managing the pandemic. He is articulate, telegenic and speaks from a script that has the right buzzwords. But he gave out free money from an overdrawn ATM that had no daily limit to almost anyone who could vote. If you were a senior who didn't need it, he still tried to buy your vote. If you were young and wanted to volunteer, he created a now scandal-ridden grant program that we didn't need and couldn't afford to try to gain your vote. If you are green, he now wants to fund programs we can't afford for initiatives that weren't sustainable even when they were affordable. Despite funding almost anything, he won't fund a forward-thinking sustainable recovery plan for a new economy beyond simple handouts. He won't adequately fund made-in-Canada vaccines that could help put an earlier end to the economic consequences of this pandemic. He won't partner with intelligent business leaders to find innovative solutions to stimulate real growth and fund novel technology. He can't think outside the box because he doesn't understand the box he is in.When Bill Morneau spoke truth to power, he was thrown under the bus like an inconvenient piece of baggage. The least truthful words a finance minister can hear when the knives are out is that he has the full support of his leader. To leave at a time of over $340-billion deficits, amid one of the greatest economic crises Canada has ever faced, speaks volumes to the level of discord and unwanted truthful disagreement.Bill Morneau announces his resignation as minister of finance on Parliament Hill on Aug. 17, 2020.Trudeau has now established a pattern of making choices based on optics, politics and inefficient spending. It is hard to sell three-day old fish as fresh, when you can't hide the smell. Jody Wilson-Raybould wouldn't bend to inappropriate political interference and paid the price. The story fabricated to diminish her wasn't believable and the motive for doing so was unpalatable. She sounded truthful, he did not. As a consequence, she was re-elected as an independent and the Liberals lost their majority. Repeated ethics violations are easy to see and condemn, and lame excuses are hard to sell. Prorogation of Parliament to avoid open review to find the truth is a Band-Aid that can't cover a growing wound.Our current crisis needs leaders who speak truth with power, determination and courage. We need leaders who respect diverse opinions and learn from their mistakes. We need leaders whose primary concern is how to fight the pandemic, heal our suffering, save jobs and businesses and fix the economy. We need leaders with vision, not ones with blinders who are guided by the basest political motives.When Liberal newspapers and staunch Liberal supporters lose their appetite for fluff over substance, the jig is up. An election may well come by next spring.When the electorate votes with their feet, leaders who fail to tell or accept the truth will get trampled as a result. The stampede has started and the loss may follow. Not being able to tell the truth or sell the lies will have consequences.Harry Rakowski is a professor of medicine at the University of Toronto and a cardiologist at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre in Toronto.Rex Murphy: Why the WE spree won't go quietly the way of other Liberal mishandlings(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rex-murphy-why-the-we-spree-wont-go-quietly-the-way-of-other-liberal-mishandlings/wcm/ec5ba056-510d-4e78-b919-5184bb140577/)Erin O'Toole: As prime minister, I will stand up to China(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/erin-otoole-as-prime-minister-i-will-stand-up-to-china/wcm/e68377d7-cd87-463c-9b6d-3598a681e104/) !@COPYRIGHT=© 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.
