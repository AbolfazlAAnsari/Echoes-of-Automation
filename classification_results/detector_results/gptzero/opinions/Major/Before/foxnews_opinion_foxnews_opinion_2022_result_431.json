How will a few dollars here or a cup of coffee there improve a person’s situation anyway? In fact, many think such generosity actually exacerbates their situation by enabling people tocontinue panhandling, or worse, pay for drugs or alcohol.GIVING TUESDAY: BLANKETS OF HOPE HELPS KEEP THE HOMELESS WARM IN 'MASSIVE MOVEMENT OF KINDNESS'I’d like to suggest a different narrative this holiday season. I have a friend that I’ll call Steven. He moved to New York City after college for a job that he lost when his mental health declined. He consequently lost his health insurance, effectively halting his treatment.Being a mobile outreach allows City Relief to set up directly on the streets of New York City and New Jersey and go directly to places where people experiencing homelessness congregateSteven slept in the street because he didn’t feel safe in the city’s congregate shelters, an all-too-common feeling among homeless New Yorkers.Additionally, the shame of what people would think of hismental healthand homelessness forced him into despair and isolation.When I met him on the street, he was completely alone. I invited him to volunteer at our outreach events. City Relief makes a point to include our unhoused guests as contributors, not just beneficiaries.Volunteers from Mastercard provide the day's fresh vegan soup at one of City Relief's mobile resource centers on a Wednesday in Chelsea Park, New York.Steven agreed, and over time, began to open up to our team. He found purpose and a sense of belonging through serving other people in a similar situation. Eventually, City Relief staff helped him findappropriate mental health care, stable housing, and a job that pays a living wage.Maybe you’re not sure how you can help people like Steven -- you are not alone. I have met hundreds of people over the years who want to make a difference but don’t know where to start. If that’s you, remember this: always start with what you have, right where you are.Steven shared with me that even on his worst days, there were random people who offered him the dignity of eye contact, a short conversation, or even a cup of coffee. He insists that thesesmall acts of compassioncarried him through the most difficult seasons of his life.Lawyers from both the New York Legal Assistance Group and BOMBAS help guests navigate their housing options during the Wednesday Chelsea Park outreach.What if your family and friends were to dedicate an hour this holiday season to assemble what I callkindness kits?These are Ziploc bags that have essentials like travel-size deodorants, body wash, toothbrushes, toothpaste, new socks, bottled water, or a gift card for a local coffee shop.Once assembled, you can walk the streets and look for people like Steven who might need help getting through the day. Or if that makes you uncomfortable, you can donate them to an organization like City Relief who will gladly distribute them on your behalf.Another idea may be to collect winter coats, gloves, and hats that are in good condition and distribute or donate them toyour neighborswho will spend a lot of time outside this winter. You could also make afinancial donationto your nonprofit of choice and invite your friends or colleagues to follow suit. You will be surprised by how much helping others may end up helping you.The truth is that many of us are experiencing difficulties right now. As a result, choosing compassion over complacency may not feel natural. But what I have learned from people like Steven is that when life is taking more from you than you have to give, the best thing to help yourself is to look for ways to help someone else.Josiah Haken is CEO ofCity Relief,a faith-based nonprofit organization dedicated to connecting those experiencing or at risk of homelessness to the resources they need to improve their lives.
