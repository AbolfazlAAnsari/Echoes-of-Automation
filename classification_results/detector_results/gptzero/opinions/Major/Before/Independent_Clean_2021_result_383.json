She can rest assured that it isn't. My wife kept her own name but still the cards arrive addressed to \"Mr and Mrs Michael O'Hare\", even from family members and friends to whom we have specifically requested otherwise. Irritated, my wife puts them all in a pile and says to me, \"those are the ones for you and your mum\".Michael O'HareNorthwood, MiddlesexToo much for England's batsmenTo learn this morning that, despite all the fighting talk beforehand,the England cricket team has yet again failed to make a competitive score in a Test matchis not only very disappointing but also puzzling. It seems as if, for several years now, England has been unable to field a Test side where, with the exception of one or two individuals, the top order batsman actually card decent scores. I've not studied the statistics but it is no longer a rare phenomenon that the tail-end of the batting order accrues more runs than the so-called specialists.So what is going so wrong that England can produce such mediocrity with such alarming consistency in this format of the game when in the shorter formats the England squad leads the world? Still regarded by many as the purest form of professional cricket, the Test match requires not only batsmen of exceptional skill and shedloads of patience but also a level of concentration that doctors might be tempted to identify as some kind of medical disorder. The England camp undoubtedly has players with the necessary batting skills but they are clearly lacking in the other vital qualities.Is it simply a sad truth that even though different players are selected for the different formats, albeit with some overlap, the current generation of batting professionals actually prefer the limited overs formats and as such are no longer minded to plug away at the crease for hours when the shorter game allows them to swing the bat from the very first delivery?I am evermore inclined to think that in the UK at least it is not only the viewing public that prefers the drama and instant gratification of a T20 match but the players themselves who on balance get a greater return for, let's face it, less effort.J WellsAlresford, HampshireRead MoreLetters: How can we justify the unstunned slaughter of animals?Letters: Boris Johnson could learn a thing or two from the BibleLetters: Christmas is a time of mutual respect - we need to remember thatLetters: How can we justify the unstunned slaughter of animals?Letters: Boris Johnson could learn a thing or two from the BibleLetters: Christmas is a time of mutual respect - we need to remember that"
