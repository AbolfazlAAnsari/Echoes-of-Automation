            "inputText": "I watched Trump and the celebrity doctor with my patient, wishing health could really be that simple.One afternoon during my final year of training to be a doctor, I interviewed to work on “The Dr. Oz Show.” I didn’t get to meetMehmet Ozhimself, but I did explore the back room full of products — weight-loss supplements, anti-aging tinctures, brightly colored workout bands. I joined the team for a lunchtime delivery of Pinkberry frozen yogurt with more toppings than I had ever seen. Later that afternoon, I returned to the sights and smells of sickness in the hospital pleasantly full of tart yogurt and chocolate chips and dreams of celebrity.I interviewed for the show because I wanted to know what it might be like to be a doctor on television. Truth be told, it still interests me, and I am not alone in my fascination with what it means to practice — or, perhaps more accurately, to perform — as a doctor for the public.But for me, a television studio will never be a doctor’s office, not even metaphorically, as Dr. Oz said his studio would be for his interview with Donald J. Trump. It can’t be, even with all the right props. It’s no longer two people in a room, doctor and patient fumbling through, exposed and vulnerable, with unspoken permission to ask and answer even the most embarrassing questions in pursuit of the shared goal of improving health. The television studio is a place for performance, and we can consume and even enjoy it as such, but must not mistake it for the real thing.On Thursday, in the midst of the presidential medical record hysteria, the Republican nominee and the celebrity doctor were together on television, chatting about Mr. Trump’shealthand the health care issues facing the American public. Mr. Trump did not release his in-depth medical records to Dr. Oz, but he did hand the doctor a one-page report from his physician.He acknowledged that he’d like to lose some weight, but that it’s hard to do so, and noted that when he looks in the mirror, he sees himself as a man of 35. He smiled contentedly when Dr. Oz raised his eyebrows and — to the cheers of the audience — commended Mr. Trump’s testosterone level. This made for good TV, but what we observed was a show, a veneer that we have seen something reassuringly truthful, when in fact we have no idea whether we have or not.Let me take you into a real examining room. This is how it works. The room is often small and sometimes it is uncomfortably warm or cold. I might spend too much time looking at the computer, and I apologize for that but I have to type what you’re telling me, and I can promise you that I am listening, too. Sometimes I double back to ask things I might have forgotten, or you go off on what seems like a tangent, but it is important, because it is what you choose to tell me.When we are done talking, I ask you to get on the examining table, if you can. I might help you up. I give you a moment to take off your shirt and change into a gown so that I can listen to your lungs and then your heart (in that order, because I’m a lung doctor), or sometimes I clumsily unbutton your shirt myself, then I examine your abdomen and then your legs. I press your ankles to check for swelling.We talk a little bit more. You can tell me anything, and from time to time you do. There is no public; these exchanges aren’t made for an audience. It isn’t television, so there are no commercial breaks. Sometimes it goes on too long. And when the exam is over, that isn’t where it ends. There is always more to do.The idea that good health and stamina can be distilled into responses to a scripted set of questions — low prostate-specific antigen (PSA), normal heart ultrasound and cheer-worthy testosterone — is as much a fiction as any prime-time medical TV drama. In one of myfavorite studies, from The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers watched an enviable amount of television, including a year’s worth of “ER” and “Chicago Hope,” and recorded what happened when a patient received CPR.They found that when someone’s heart stopped on TV, that person was far more likely to recover than they would be in actual life. Of course, these shows are works of fiction. And yet, there is a danger. As the lines between fiction and reality increasingly blur, it’s easy to view these outcomes as reflective of the truth.Health and sickness are messier. At best, an actual doctor on television can act as a journalist, or translator, who has enough specific knowledge to explain and contextualize medical findings in lay terms and, maybe on a very good day, even change behavior. Dr. Oz may have offered us something more than mere entertainment, but we shouldn’t fool ourselves that watching his interview with Mr. Trump gave us a window into the doctor’s office, or taught us anything truly meaningful about Mr. Trump’s health or our own.I didn’t end up working for “The Dr. Oz Show.” My medical rotations conflicted with the filming schedule. I hadn’t seen the show in quite some time before I tuned in for Thursday’s event. I watched from a patient’s room at a hospital for the chronically ill, amid the beeping of ventilators and heart rate monitors overhead. My patient and I glanced at each other as Dr. Oz enumerated Mr. Trump’s results and declared him to be in good health. I think we both wished it could be that simple.Daniela J.
