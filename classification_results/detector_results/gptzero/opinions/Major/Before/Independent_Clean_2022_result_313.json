We urgently need not only a general election but also reform of our voting system and constitution.Susan AlexanderSouth GloucestershireTo keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clickinghereWe need a grown up home secretaryThe security of Britain is overseen by the home secretaryï»¿. This minister is responsible for keeping everyone in the country safe. The controversial new home secretary, Suella Braverman, has been previously probed for leaks in Britain’s security services.Tory party chair Nadhim Zahawi does not deny “multiple breaches” of ministerial code were made by Braverman. Yet she is now entrusted with overseeing the work of the security service. This is one of the most sensitive jobs in government, responsible for signing off surveillance warrants and other highly classified spy agency functions, as well as the national counter-terrorism strategy and implementation.Can we feel secureï»¿ with Leaky Sue in charge of our security? With Leaky Sue using her personal mobile as well as a government mobile for sending classified material, the government is wide open to infiltration.Rishi Sunakhas said his “government will have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level”. Yet Braverman seems intent on challenging this statement, firstly for integrity and accountability with her careless use of her own mobile, but especially for professionalism, with her record in the worsening conditions at the migrant processing in Manston in Kent.In the overcrowded centre, there have been outbreaks of diphtheria, of scabies and of MRSA. Previous Tory home secretaries Priti Patel and Grant Shapps have declared unequivocally that they had acted to ensure such overcrowding conditions did not happen in a facility designed to be transitory, 48 hours at most. The question needs to be asked is Braverman incompetent, uncaring or just engaged in posture politics to appeal to hard-right extremists?Can we afford to have such a self-seeking rabble rouser, still fighting for the Tory leadership, in such a sensitive position in government, especially when she is floundering on so many levels? Surely there is a grown-up right-wing Tory MP who can replace her? Or is competence and placing country and party above personal ambition so rare among Tory MPs?Pete MiloryTrowbridge"
