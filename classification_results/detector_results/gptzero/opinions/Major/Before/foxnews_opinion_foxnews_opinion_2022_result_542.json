More trade and investment will lead to prosperity and a greater chance to foster the kinds of freedoms that have been the basis of our strongest alliances for decades.We can take several steps to start moving along this path. First, we need to reauthorize the importation of a broad range of qualified goods under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). This is critical to opening the U.S. market to countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Cambodia needs better access to markets in the U.S., its second-largest trading partner.The U.S. should move quickly to include Cambodia in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF).This will tie it more closely to us and our most important allies and developing country partners in theAsia-Pacific region. IPEF can be a launch point for the United States to reenter the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which features high-standards trade and market access chapters.Unfortunately theBiden administrationhas a moratorium on new trade deals and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) is a pipe dream unless the administration recognizes the role that Congress plays in settingtrade policy.We have the means to make Southeast Asia a key partnership region. This will lead to the expansion and adoption of U.S. values, including the rule of law, human rights, and upward economic mobility.Free and fair trade, when done well, can lift people out of poverty and provide economic benefits for all countries involved. The U.S. can no longer afford to retreat from the international stage.A clear presence in the heart of theIndo-Pacificwill ensure U.S. interests are well positioned into the 21st Century.Republican Beth Van Duyne represents Texas's 24th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives.Republican Ron Estes represents Kansas' 4th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives.Republican Carol Miller represents West Virginia's Third Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
