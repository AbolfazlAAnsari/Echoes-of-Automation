As a result, Facebook's profit model prioritized outrage and reinforced our narrow biases.Once this switch was flipped, Facebook's initial purpose collided with the revenue model it had moved toward, and the company has never properly reconciled these conflicting pressures. The closest it has come to doing so was when it established an independent content oversight board to address concerns over hate speech and digital manipulation. Two weeks before the presidential election, that board has still not met.A perfect storm of wider changes has brought Facebook to this point. Our society is more divided than ever, traditional journalism is dying, and political commentary is fixated on polarization and a determined suspension of our collective reality. Zuckerberg may point to these issues as the real problem, claiming that Facebook's initial mission was derailed by changes in our social fabric. This abdication of responsibility overlooks the simple fact that Facebook helped create this social fabric through its revenue model and dogged resistance to proactive content moderation.The reality is that Facebook has never adequately articulated or lived its purpose. Consequently, it has been left rudderless to address the changes of the past decade and has been unaccountable to its stakeholders - relying only on self-interest wrapped in an amorphous commitment to free speech. This vacuum of purpose has created an irresistible opening for government, as we are seeing today.When lawmakers, courts and regulators see the erosion of the fourth estate, the threat to free and fair elections, and practical challenges like anti-vaccine sentiment spreading online, of course they will develop an appetite to change a company that has otherwise eschewed any responsibility for creating or addressing these problems. It is only a matter of time.Redefining your purpose and instituting it across your organization is an investment in a better future for our world and for your business. For Zuckerberg, the question is simple: will Facebook realign its purpose today and amortize the immediate shock over the long term? Or will it remain purposeless, making ad hoc shifts as the wind changes direction, allowing regulation and litigation to shock its stock price and viability at every turn?For all our sakes, I hope the right answer is obvious.Jodi Butts is an executive and a member of the expert panel of the Canadian Centre for the Purpose of the Corporation(https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://navltd.com/ccpc/__;!!MtWvt2UVEQ!Sdn3dWHUQl2uJHwKDfgmAEJ8bK_jrokKjGGAU-URBAQORJb9sUnZ4Y85-mXaHjIArQ$), an initiative of Navigator Ltd.
