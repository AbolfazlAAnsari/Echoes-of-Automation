            "inputText": "Letters to the editor: our readers share their views. Please send your letters toletters@independent.co.ukI am sick and tired of hearing government spokespeople defendingMPswho have highly lucrative second jobs. How many employers would be happy to pay a full time salary to a part time employee? Very few I should think, so why should the long suffering taxpayer be expected to do so?I doubt if the other lame excuse for MPs having two jobs - that of needing to be in touch with \"the real world\" - would cut much ice either. They should have had plenty of experience of that before they asked their constituents to propel them into theHouse of Commons, with all its privileges, prestige and expenses.The fact is, to put it politely, these MPs are shamelessly taking the Mick. The danger is that we all become so used to self-serving, dubious politicians that our expectations are permanently lowered. This is clearly already happening, and is very bad for the health of the body politic.Penny LittleOxfordshirePolitical sleazeIn my 90 plus years, I have never known such a disgraceful government, with the prime minister just ignoring and in effect laughing at the elected representatives when they call for his conduct to be discussed in the House. He just stayed away when he could have spoken online, or asked for another time to be allocated. He must not be allowed to act like another Donald Trump!The whole cabinet needs to face interrogation of their actions.Margaret WhiteAddress suppliedIf paid external work undertaken by MPs is to be seen to be appropriate, it must pass the smell test of being work unrelated to their roles as elected representatives. This means that it must be work that is clearly obtained by virtue of their training and experience outside parliament and of a kind which they would have undertaken even if not elected. This test would no doubt rule out most of the \"consultancies\" that currently seem so popular.John WilkinBury St EdmundsI am perfectly comfortable with Geoffrey Cox earning £800,000 a year following his professional career as a lawyer. I do, however, object to him also having a part-time job on the side to earn his pin money, around £82,000 a year, thus depriving someone else the opportunity to have a full time job as a member of parliament. Someone who will attend parliament regularly for parliamentary and constituency business, not simply for access to the corridors of power whenever it suits them.Darryl PrattLeamington SpaPeople on universal credit have their benefits reduced as they earn money from employment. Why not apply the same principle to MPs? Any MP earning money from outside work should have their MP salary reduced in proportion to what they earn.Mike SimpsonPrestonMy question isn't whether MPs should have two jobs but how on earth do they have time? Surely 24/7 they are dealing with the needs, sometimes desperate, of their constituents? Otherwise they are listening to, making speeches on, or engaging and voting on important matters of state. How can there be time for anything else?My grandmother worked in a mill and then as a cleaner. Despite her obvious intelligence she had no time to take up a consultancy for an international conglomerate. How easy can the job of an MP be?Michael O'HareNorthwood, MiddlesexRecently there have been several articles and letters published about \"Tory sleaze\". For balance should it not be highlighted that many Labour MPs, including Angela Rayner, are supported financially by Trade Unions? I'm sure that the Trade Unions expect something in return. This can cause an issue between the Unions interests and those of the MP's constituents.Michael PatePrestonNewspaper coverage of sleaze surrounding this government is ceaseless. It's proving too much to keep on top of it all. Is the answer to learn speed-reading?Roger HindsSurreyUK is in a sad stateAs a 60-something, born and bred here, I passionately agree with the sentiments expressed in W P Moore's letter ('At the age of 76, I am ready to give up on this once proud country', 9 November).There is much to say about the apparent current state of our democracy and each day our hearts grow heavier. This letter encapsulates the feelings in our household perfectly. We are disillusioned and feel disenfranchised. Shame on this prime minister and his cronies. If they are the establishment role models for our grandchildren, we are fearful for their future.My father, who was born in 1920 and died at 95, also worked for our country and was an open minded loyal subject who fought for justice, peace and decency. We ignore this legacy at our peril and should be brave enough to say so.Susan TaylorAddress suppliedI am 73 years old and have always been proud of my country. Now I am ashamed to say that this government is embarrassing, corrupt and self-serving. The politicians in this government are not statesmen; they are like the black marketeers in the war, just after their own interests, not caring for the people in this country.I feel sorry for the youngsters of today because they have little chance of jobs and no one to inspire them and this government leaving Europe has made it difficult to travel and work abroad. I am lucky that I am retired and have had the privilege to live in times of great statesmen who, even if you didn't agree with their politics, you respected, unlike this government which has no respect for their voters and change the rules when it suits them. God bless us all, because we certainly need him.Valerie JacksonWirralI have to agree with everythingW P Moore of Norwich has to sayin his well worded letter about being ready to give up on his country.I would suggest however that the country he feels so strongly about is England. I am also 76 but I now feel fortunate that me and my family were relocated to Aberdeen with my job in 1984. When Nicola Sturgeon was recently accused of abusing her position, she spent a whole day answering questions, unlike our prime minister who avoids any questioning of his behaviour. I, like W P Moore, don't understand why the electorate continue to support Boris Johnson and third rate cabinet.Anyone who doesn't understand why the SNP is so popular in Scotland only has to look at the state of English politics. I have already given up on my English heritage.Alan LamminDumfriesNazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeWho among us cannot be moved by the pictures of Richard Ratcliffe,as he endures another hunger strikein support of his wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, and to highlight her illegal detainment by Iran?It shames our country massively that, over these years, a succession of foreign secretaries (Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Liz Truss) have failed to bring Nazanin home.Can any one of us imagine what she has endured and continues to endure? Any woman? Any parent? Or what Richard and Gabriella have endured and continue to endure? It's heartbreaking on every level. And anger inducing. I do hope this worst of all governments in the worst of all possible times is not relying on Richard Ratcliffe's incredible dignity to let them off the hook. He is a hero (though he shouldn't have to be). The government is shameful (though it absolutely shouldn't be).Beryl WallLondon W4Who is responsible for the climate crisis?At one time, not so long ago, the UK was a world leader in manufacturing, albeit in a heavily polluting manner. Alas now, thanks in no small way to Margaret Thatcher's ideology, and even up to the present Tory leader's \"f**k business\" utterance, this is no longer the case. It should therefore be relatively easy for us to meet our emissions targets.However it is perhaps not so easy for those countries like China, where we have effectively outsourced all our manufacturing, and the Asian countries which supply our clothes and textiles.
