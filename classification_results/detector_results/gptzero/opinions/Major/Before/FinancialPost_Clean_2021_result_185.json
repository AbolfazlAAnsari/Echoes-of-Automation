Its stress tests on uninsured mortgages are meant to protect federally regulated financial institutions from taking on too much risk. Mortgages make up a large part of the major banks' loan portfolios. Mortgage credit is a majority of household credit and about one-third of all lending by the financial sector. As a result, mortgage lending can pose a considerable risk to financial stability. Like other issues surrounding financial stability, it is best left to policy experts at OSFI to control.As for CMHC, it has a mandate to help Canadians access affordable housing options. An important part of its strategy is to insure high-risk mortgages through mortgage default insurance. Like other insurance companies, it limits the risk it takes on by proscribing the types of mortgages that can be insured and by setting insurance premiums that protect its capital. In recent decades, CMHC has increased its reserves and the premiums it charges so as to ensure its soundness in the event of a big housing downturn. It is hard to understand how elected officials might conclude they are better placed to determine what insurance premium CMHC should charge in order to achieve the best balance between affordability and stability. And remember: any increase in risk on CMHC's balance sheet is an increase in risk for taxpayers.The parties also propose different measures to increase the supply of housing. But building homes is a slow process and in the short run demand-side measures will mainly fuel house-price inflation. We can debate each set of proposals, but what is truly missing is a serious debate about the goals of a national housing policy. Does affordability mean every Canadian should own their own home?
