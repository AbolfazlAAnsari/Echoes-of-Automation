The Post then asked two prominent Jewish groups (The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) and B'nai Brith) to provide comment without that context.? While the Post story included further explanation from the Brown campaign, Mr. Brown's comments have been distorted and abused and I'd like to explain a little further.Mr. Brown was making a point that the Canadian government's assistance to refugees from Ukraine serves as an example of just how quickly countries can act when there is the political will to do so.? Mr. Brown said that the same political will should extend to Ahmadiyya and Sikh refugees in Afghanistan, Yazidis in Iraq and Muslims in Yemen and Myanmar.? Nowhere in these examples did Mr. Brown refer to anything having to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.?Only when Mr. Brown was asked a question regarding \"refugees in Palestine\" did he make an all-encompassing statement expressing a sentiment that Canada should \"be able to help with refugees from Palestine, Yemen and Afghanistan.\"A portion of the statement from the Brown campaign published in the Post bears repeating. It stated \"... he never drew or intended to draw a comparison between the tragedy of the refugee situation in Ukraine ...\" and anything to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Nonetheless, many in my Jewish community are upset.? But to my fellow Jews, to CIJA and to the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee (CJPAC), know this:? I have known Patrick Brown for the last decade.? He is committed to the strength and security of Israel.? He believes in democracy, and if given the opportunity as Leader of the Conservative Party (and eventually Prime Minister), will work diligently for peace.? At the very same time, Patrick Brown is known for creating a political environment that welcomes all religions: Jews, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Hindus and more.? This has served him well in expanding the membership of the Ontario PC Party and it will serve him well when he does the same thing for the Conservative Party of Canada.After all, who wouldn't want all parties to look like our country?? To be a fair representation of the many cultures and religions that make this country great?? Only Mr. Brown's opponents.? In fact, some political people in the Jewish community who are aligned with Pierre Poilievre have already begun to use these printed words as a weapon for political gain rather than for the cause of truly fighting antisemitism.Over my many years in media I have come to learn what a powerful tool newspapers can be.? I have also learned that sometimes we just miss our target when that context is lacking.? Given both my understanding of the situation and my knowledge of Mr. Brown's character, I believe that this is one of those times where the media may have missed its mark.Paul Godfrey is Chair of Postmedia Network Inc., owner of the National Post !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
