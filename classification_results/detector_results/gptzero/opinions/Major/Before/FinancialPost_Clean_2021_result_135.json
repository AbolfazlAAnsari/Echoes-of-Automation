Our framers included democratic socialists like Blakeney and conservatives like Lougheed(https://www.constitutionalstudies.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lougheed.pdf), who may have disagreed about many rights questions, but agreed that legislatures have an interpretive role to play, alongside the courts, in the interpretation of charter rights. These premiers drafted Section 33 to explicitly recognize this role.This doesn't mean that there shouldn't be political standards for evaluating when legislatures ought to invoke Section 33. On the contrary, the notwithstanding clause should be reserved for legislative disagreements with the judicial interpretation of laws concerning important questions of how rights relate to public policy.Perhaps the best illustration of this was Saskatchewan's 2018 invocation of Section 33 to protect public funding for non-Catholic students at Catholic schools. A trial court held that extending state funding to non-Catholics at historically state-supported Catholic schools violated the charter's protection of religious neutrality. The province held the reasonable view that extending funding this way actually made historically protected funding for Catholic schools more neutral, and said exactly that in the preamble of the legislation invoking the notwithstanding clause.Laws that properly invoke the notwithstanding clause need not meet judicial standards of justification precisely because they are meant to be justified to Canadian citizens as reasonable protections for rights. Ontario's invocation provokes an interesting consideration of this point. Gerald Butts, a critic of Section 33, tweeted: \"make no mistake, if one Premier gets away with overriding the Charter on campaign finance, the flood gates will open. We'll have US style Super PACs faster than you can say Citizens United.\"This is a silly thing to say because the bill in question, Bill 254, is designed precisely to ensure that American-style PAC spending doesn't happen in Ontario. Conservative MPP Lindsey Park tweeted(https://twitter.com/lparkpc/status/1402709816443875335), \"This is about individual voters in Ontario deciding the result of elections not American-style super PACs.\" And a Globe and Mail editorial stated(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-doug-ford-is-right-about-limiting-third-party-political-spending-and/): \"Doug Ford is right about limiting third-party political spending, and dead wrong about how to do it.\" If Ford's policy is in the space of reasonable disagreement, then it's hard to see why citizens and their elected representatives should not be free to debate whether it imposes reasonable limits on the scope of charter rights.One can criticize the rushed timing of the legislation, which may apply these rules to Ontario's next election. But that does not invalidate the legislation's clearly reasonable limit on freedom of expression. One can even substantively disagree with Ontario's decision to use the clause and think that it is perfectly democratic for the legislature to have some say over how freedom of expression relates to limits on third-party campaign spending six months prior to an election.The notwithstanding clause is not a poison pill that undermines Canadian democracy. The clause ensures our legislatures can play an active role in protecting and defining charter rights. That is something we should welcome as democratic citizens.Peter L.
