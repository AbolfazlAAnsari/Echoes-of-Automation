But as the cost of these decisions adds up, and with new COVID-19 variants on the horizon, we may need to reassess the costs and benefits of our current approach to better optimize care for all Canadians - not just COVID patients. That includes allowing Canadians to access private alternatives. Not only would this help those specific patients, but it would also potentially reduce the strain on our overburdened public system.Rosine Chouinard-Chauveau's tragic story has shone a new light on an old problem - one that has been exacerbated, but was not caused, by COVID-19. While it will take significant reform to address the routine rationing of care in our health-care system, governments across Canada can no longer ignore the many non-COVID patients who've paid a heavy price since the pandemic began.Bacchus Barua is associate director of health policy studies at the Fraser Institute. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
