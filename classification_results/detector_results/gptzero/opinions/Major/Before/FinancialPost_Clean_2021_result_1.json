            "inputText": "The following open letter calling on the Ontario government to reopen schools was signed by eight doctors who work in health-care education.We are writing to strongly support the Ontario government's plan to reopen elementary schools on Jan. 11 and secondary schools on Jan. 25 for in-person instruction.While the Ontario government decided to temporarily close schools as part of broader social, retail and industrial restrictions to counter COVID-19, extending the school closures beyond the anticipated end dates will lead to unnecessary, and likely irreversible, short-term and long-term damage to our children. As our understanding of COVID-19 has matured over the past year, several facts are better understood and, as a result, our current strategy must differ from our initial expansive pandemic response.First, our children are at low risk of developing significant disease due to COVID-19. The likelihood that a given child will require hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit or mechanical ventilation is lower with COVID-19 than it is after infection with RSV or influenza, which is reassuring for Canadian parents.Second, our children appear to play a limited role in viral transmission(https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html). In Ontario, the spread of COVID-19(https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data) in educational settings is at least 10-fold lower than in our vulnerable long-term care facilities. It does not appear as though school attendance amplifies community transmission(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32371442/ ) of COVID-19, and while there have been cases reported in schools, the number of documented pediatric cases is far lower than most other age groups. Some of the reduced transmission may be related to strong public health measures, such as personal hygiene, the use of personal protective equipment, physical distancing and disinfection procedures in Canadian schools, and is a credit to the stringent protocols enacted by educators.Finally, it is now clear that interrupted school attendance results in immediate and long-term damage to our children and that virtual school attendance is not a suitable replacement for in-person instruction. Numerous recent studies(https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/covid-19-and-learning-loss-disparities-grow-and-students-need-help#) have demonstrated significant(https://www.wsj.com/articles/failure-in-the-virtual-classroom-11592776152) deficiencies in the educational development(https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-boys-are-more-at-risk-of-falling-behind-during-remote-school-11606222801) of children around the world. Some studies suggest that even the short-term shutdowns in the spring have led to(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2772834) literacy and math delays of up to one year, with regression in reading ability noted in some populations. As expected, at-risk children who were already struggling have been even harder hit. Unfortunately, because of the time-sensitive nature of educational interventions, these deficits may never be recovered and will result in long-term challenges for countless children.Furthermore, there is a reported two- to three-fold increase in potential school failure(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-students-grades-are-dropping-with-shift-to-remote-education-as/) rates in Ontario and Quebec high schools, many of which are relying on virtual education. These failures occurring during the crucial time of high school education will affect high school completion, post-secondary education acceptance and career opportunities. Secondary school completion is an important marker of long-term health and financial success and, once again, those who are marginalized will bear the brunt of these deficiencies, leading to increased illness and poverty.Other consequences of school closures include worsening mental health(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212420920313479), substance abuse, anxiety, depression and suicidality amongst children and teens. Reductions in physical activity and staggering increases in screen time have also been demonstrated and are in direct opposition to the clear public health initiatives set forward by the Canadian Pediatric Society and others. Food insecurity has been exacerbated by school closures, especially amongst marginalized children. School closures also result in a reduction or elimination of supportive peer and teacher social interaction, which is critical for the development of both teenage and younger children. This social environment may also be the only safe place for countless children suffering from escalating figures of neglect and abuse. While we can now see the immediate negative effects of school closures in front of us, we as clinicians and researchers can only estimate the devastating long-term consequences these deficiencies may have on our future population.While in-person school restrictions might be considered if they led to a demonstrable reduction in COVID-19, this does not appear to be the case. A recent study published by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States noted that the majority of pediatric COVID cases could be traced to transmission from out-of-school gatherings and not from school attendance. In fact, some studies report that school closures are not effective interventions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and may actually increase mortality related to COVID-19 due to resultant health-care worker(https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30082-7/fulltext) absenteeism. This lack of effectiveness should make Ontario's leadership question whether these restrictive policies are necessary and should be considered by any Canadian jurisdiction that may be contemplating school closures.While we understand the rationale for isolated and limited restrictions, as physicians we recognize that the optimized long-term social determinants of health depend on a quality education for all children. Education is the greatest public investment we can make for our society's future.In conclusion, we strongly support the Ontario government's plan to reopen schools for in-person instruction and we strongly advocate for continuing in-person education across Canada to prevent unnecessary short-term and long-term damage to our nation's children. Visionary leadership looks not only at the current metrics of hospital admissions, case counts and financial deficits, but considers the long-term implications of decisions that affect the vulnerable populations in our society. Our children will soon shoulder the debt created by this pandemic, and to do so effectively they cannot suffer the consequences of short-sighted and reactionary decision-making, including on-going educational disruptions.Sincerely,Dr. Douglas Mack, assistant clinical professor, department of pediatrics, McMaster UniversityDr. Sarah Khan, assistant professor, McMaster UniversityDr. Alvin Loh, chair, Physicians of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Advocacy and assistant professor, division of developmental pediatrics, University of TorontoDr. Jeffrey Pernica, head, division of infectious diseases and associate professor, department of pediatrics, McMaster UniversityDr. Neil Rau, assistant professor, department of medicine, University of TorontoDr. Michael Rieder, CIHR-GSK chair in pediatric clinical pharmacology, departments of pediatrics, physiology and pharmacology and medicine, University of Western OntarioDr. Thomas Warren, assistant clinical professor (adjunct), McMaster UniversityDr. Martha Fulford, associate professor, division of infectious diseases, McMaster UniversityPaul W.
