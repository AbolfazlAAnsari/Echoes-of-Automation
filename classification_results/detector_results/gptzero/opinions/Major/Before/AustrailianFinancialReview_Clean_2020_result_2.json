            "inputText": "Economy With monetary policy exhausted, below-target inflation isn't holding back the economy. We need effective measures to stimulate investment and growth.In the The Australian Financial Review's most recent quarterly survey, economists expressed their usual diversity of opinion on whether the Reserve Bank's inflation target should be changed and, if so, what should replace it. What's at stake here?One view is that the target should be lowered so that it corresponds with the current rate of inflation. Isn't it cheating to shift the target so that it fits the outcome? Not quite. If it was clear that the current target was unachievable, then it would make sense to change it. That would, at least, take the pressure off the RBA to push interest rates down still further in futile pursuit of an impossible objective.But the inflation process hasn't been tested during the current cycle. Inflation has been kept down by a combination of structural factors such as globalisation, together with a lacklustre recovery from the 2008 crisis. When capacity and the labour market come under pressure, inflation will pick up. The problem is not that the target is too high but that activity has been too weak.Others suggest widening the target range, replacing 2 to 3 per cent with, say, 1 to 3 per cent. Some history might help here. When targeting began in the early 1990s, most central banks followed the pioneering New Zealand model, specifying a range, often with zero as the lower bound.At the RBA, this was seen as problematic. It made no sense to have hard edges to the target: to be just under the upper bound was fine, while to be just outside the band was policy failure. It made more sense to set the target in terms of a central tendency - with the focus on the bullseye rather than the outer ring. This provided an unambiguous number to help anchor expectations.But of course a single-number target would not be met continuously. Monetary policy is an imprecise tool, with operational lags. Inflation varies over the cycle. The important issue is that inflation expectations should stay anchored.Thus the bullseye of the target was a \"thick point\", just like a shooting range target. Scoring an \"inner\" or an \"outer\" on the target was OK as long as, over time, the average outcomes were broadly on target.Financial markets were looking for more precision than this, so over time the target came to be articulated as 2 to 3 per cent. Whether this defined the diameter of the bullseye or not, this target clearly did not have the sharp edges that had characterised the initial New Zealand-style target.The 2 to 3 per cent did fit the original idea that the target should be centred at 2.5 per cent. Why this uneven number? Pragmatism is the answer: when the inflation target was set, inflation had been much higher, and the more usual target of 2 per cent looked like a bridge too far.That didn't seem to be a critical issue. Alan Greenspan articulated the common-sense view: \"Price stability is that state in which expected changes in the general price level do not effectively alter business or household decisions.\" That still seems true.Philip Lowe expressed a similar view at last year's Jackson Hole symposium. Markets might fret about decimal points, but the public cares only whether inflation is low and stable: \"In fact, many people in our communities are incredulous that we would be too worried over whether inflation was 1.6 per cent, 2 per cent or 2.2 per cent. They ask, 'Haven't you got something more important to worry about?' \"The current below-target inflation isn't holding back the economy or distorting decisions. Full employment is consistent with a range of longer-term inflation outcomes.Where does that leave us? While it is true that the inflation process has changed significantly over the past couple of decades, it still seems highly likely that when the economy is operating at full capacity (with unemployment around 4.5 per cent rather than the present rate of more than 5 per cent) inflation will be higher than it is now. The problem is not that the target needs revision, but that we need more effective measures for boosting activity towards full employment.The role of a target is to facilitate the best monetary policy setting. It has done this: the existing target has given the clear message that policy should be in expansionary mode, and the RBA responded.The problem is that these expansionary settings, here and overseas, have had so little effect in stimulating investment and growth. Their impact has been largely on asset prices and the exchange rate, where further stimulus is unhelpful.Other factors have been holding the economy back. Whether it is the legacy of the 2008 crisis, overextended balance sheets, heightened risk aversion, trade uncertainty courtesy Donald Trump, fiscal austerity, high hurdle rates on investments, short-termism, or just a general loss of economic mojo, these problems can't be offset by distorting interest rates far below their normal setting.Monetary policy is already \"pedal to the metal\" and to do more would be counterproductive.We don't need a revised inflation target to receive this simple message.Stephen Grenville is a non-resident fellow at the Lowy Institute and a former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank."
