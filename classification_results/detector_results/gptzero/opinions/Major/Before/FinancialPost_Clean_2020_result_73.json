            "inputText": "By Suzie FortinI'll be honest: I never really wanted to be with someone in the military.It wasn't the long separations, frequent moves, the perpetual hunt for new work, or acclimating my future children to unfamiliar environments that turned me off of the idea of marrying a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. To tell you the truth, I didn't know very much about these hallmarks of military family life. And even had I known, I probably would've made light of these challenges, especially after having fallen in love with my husband, Chris. For most people, the saying \"love is blind\" refers to the flaws we overlook in those closest to us; for me, it's a maxim that expresses my relationship to the military family lifestyle and its challenges, some of which civilian life could never have prepared me for.My family and community aren't from a military background. As a material and metallurgical engineer, the small town I'm from in Quebec offered me everything I needed for a good future: an engineering job at the local aluminum plant, the prospect of finding a partner I could settle down with, raise a family and stay put. Being a professional, I certainly didn't see myself becoming dependent on someone else. Chris's character, his sweetness and charm, literally swept me off my feet and aboard our ongoing 16-year journey of eight moves across the country, while raising our two boys, ages nine and 11. Over the years, I've learned to balance my boys' need for stability with the challenge of frequent moves, especially through their formative years. When it comes to relocations, destinations can be changed last minute, so I try not to get their hopes up by painting a picture of what life will be like; instead, I help them imagine what life can be like, as a family, supporting their dad, and the great country he serves, wherever the call of duty takes us. We once endured an unexpected six-month deployment, just as we were moving to a new city. Overlapping relocations and deployments can really test the resolve of military families and the serving member.My family is just a part of the diverse tapestry of Canada's 80,000+ military families. This includes the countless loved ones and friends who do whatever they can to support our serving members as they pursue their professional and sometimes dangerous responsibilities, whether that be during the CAF's mission to Afghanistan, or when 1,700 personnel were recently deployed to long-term care facilities to provide assistance for those most affected by COVID-19.At the start of the summer, I was asked to share some of my experiences in a weekly Facebook live-stream hosted by the Together We Stand Foundation(https://twsfoundation.ca/ ), a non-profit devoted to acknowledging and supporting Canadian military families. After being introduced to some of the organization's programs, such as delivering care packages to families with a loved one deployed overseas during the December holiday season, I was deeply affected by one in particular: the establishment of a day in our national calendar to thank all those who stand behind the uniform, for their service and sacrifice. Together We Stand recognized the need to honour our community, and worked behind the scenes with Gen. (ret'd) Andrew Leslie to create Military Family Appreciation Day.On June 19, 2019, the House of Commons moved to recognize the daily sacrifices military families make for the security of Canadian society, and designated the third Friday of each September as Military Family Appreciation Day(https://nationalpost.com/news/military-families-are-truly-unsung-heroes-in-canada-now-theres-a-day-to-remember-them-too/wcm/16003875-7420-47eb-ae2c-bc34d17cd6ce/) - this year's MFAD is Sept. 18. It was a unanimous consent motion, which made so much sense to me, as the members of our military and their families assume their duties on behalf of everyone in our country, regardless of where people stand on politics.Members of the Canadian Armed Forces are seen in front of the Orchard Villa long-term care home In Pickering, Ont., on May 6, 2020, during the COVID-19 crisis. A total of 1,700 military personnel were deployed to long-term care facilities to provide assistance to those most affected by the coronavirus pandemic.In a humorous effort to reduce military spouses' sense of isolation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, TWS held its live-stream from each participant's bathroom, a gesture to families quarantined at home, whose only private moments happen in the bathroom. Shortly after my spot on The Command Post - Tales from the Bathroom, TWS announced a fun and creative stay-at-home initiative for 2020's MFAD festivities: the #HomeFortChallenge. Knowing that such notable Canadians such as Col. Chris Hadfield and former prime ministers Stephen Harper and Paul Martin are building their own pillow forts to acknowledge the sacrifices of military families, helps my boys and I feel acknowledged in a way we never have before.This year has been a very difficult one for the CAF and its military family community. The tragic deaths of seven CAF members in two separate accidents this past spring highlight the crushing realities military families live with. Following these tragic incidents, my husband facilitated the grieving families' travel to CFB Trenton for the repatriation of their loved ones. We were in Halifax when these losses occurred, and were living only 15 minutes from the location of the worst mass shooting in Canadian history. But like I tell my kids, 'We are Canadians; we do not live in fear of what could happen.' Chris, like other CAF members, loves his job; it just takes some people to do this for the sake of everyone else in the country.I'll probably be more worried next time my husband deploys, because of what's happened. I'm sure many others will feel the same way. It really doesn't matter whether one grew up as a military brat, or had no connection to this lifestyle - tragedy strips us of our defences, leaving us feeling raw and overwhelmed. Witnessing how this past spring's heartbreaking events affected my stoic husband and other CAF members close to our family, I've come to recognize that I'm not a \"dependent\" whose life plans follow my partner's; it's actually the other way around. Being a military family member makes me the serving member's main support and the backbone of the Canadian Armed Forces.Given where I come from, and where I am now - we just moved to Ottawa from Nova Scotia - I want to raise awareness among my fellow Canadians and show my appreciation to all the military moms, dads, spouses, children and friends who live with the uncertainties of our lifestyle, but who continue to lovingly support the brave members of the CAF.What a wonderful stroke of irony that my last name, Fortin, actually means \"small fort\" in French. I therefore feel a special obligation to ask you to join Together We Stand's Home Fort Challenge, as a meaningful way to acknowledge our country's unsung heroes.How to get involved:. Build your home fort.. Take a photo or shoot a video clip of you and your fort.. Post your footage or photo on your social media using #homefortchallenge with a message of thanks, and challenge others to build their own forts..
