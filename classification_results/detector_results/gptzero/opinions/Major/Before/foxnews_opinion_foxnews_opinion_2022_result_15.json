One particular demographic stands out: former Chicagoans, as well as companies currently based elsewhere that had their roots in Chicago. Their love for Chicago never faded, and it saddens them to see the city struggle mightily with violence and poverty. Many of them see in the pastor and his vision the best hope to halt decades of decline so that the path of real and lasting progress may begin.One of those companies is Crane Co., an industrial products company now based in Stamford, Connecticut. With $3 billion in revenue annually, the bosses at Crane Co. certainly could have ignored the lonely pastor on the roof fighting for his neighborhood. Yet the president and CEO, Max Mitchell, knew that his company would not be where it is today without its Chicago roots. He reached out to the pastor to ask if he could spend a night on the roof to better understand the community. On the128th day of his rooftop vigil, the pastor warmly welcomed Mitchell to the roof. Both men sat by the campfire for a conversation.The pastor began by asking Mitchell to discuss Crane Co.’s beginnings.\"When the trustees of the Crane Foundation heard your message [on Fox News], we tied it back to the history of R.T.

Crane \"was committed, just like Pastor Brooks, and he really cared about Chicago. He cared about people, and he was very philanthropic. He donated money and set up foundations back in 1914 that are still giving to this day.\"\"Wow.\"Mitchell then revealed that R.T.
