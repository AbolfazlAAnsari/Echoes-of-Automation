            "inputText": "Election 2022 The Morrison government must make the economy and security the focus, and get away from extraneous debates about transgender schoolyard rights and a federal ICAC.If opinion polling is to be our guide, the outcome of the next federal election, likely to take place in May, is a foregone conclusion. The Labor Party has a substantial lead and Scott Morrison and his team have been swamped by internal squabbling and leaking in recent weeks.Many current Coalition MPs have not endured the drudgery of opposition. It is a sad and sorry place to be. You are without power and have very little influence, particularly for the first two years after an election loss. Instead of the fascination of policymaking, opposition frontbenchers are reduced to finding quiet days to put out a press releases attacking the government. As for opposition backbenchers, there is no less relevant position for a parliamentarian.Those Coalition MPs who have been leaking from the cabinet and attacking their colleagues might like to reflect on this. As they must know, they are contributing to an atmosphere where the public believes the Coalition's defeat is inevitable.In these dire circumstances, is there a plan which can give Morrison and his team yet another historic, miraculous victory?Well, the first point to make is that no election is lost three months before it is held. As long as there is life, there is hope. Even if the pathway for the Coalition to victory is a very narrow one, it exists.Second, the Coalition needs to concentrate on the issues that are its strengths: the economy and national security. In a narrow political sense, having to focus for the past two years on a major health issue has been a substantial negative for the Coalition. Health and welfare are issues on which Labor is typically favoured by the public. The more the public debate is about a health issue, the more the politics will favour Labor.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the economy has been very much a secondary consideration for the public. It won't be in the months ahead. After the election, the federal government will have to focus on two major and somewhat related problems.There will be inflationary pressures, which are a worldwide phenomenon, and they are partly a function of the massive blowout in public expenditure and the quantitative easing of central banks. Governments worldwide have spent something like $11 trillion dealing with the costs of their responses to COVID-19.The inflationary pressures have in turn led to increases in global interest rates and that trend is likely to persist.In a world with rising prices and rising interest rates, we run the very real risk of returning to an error of stagflation, which we haven't experienced since the 1970s.Governments have also been subsidising renewable energy and discouraging investment in fossil fuels. That has expanded budget deficits and caused a shortage of fossil fuel supplies, particularly gas, leading to a massive global price spike.That leaves the next government with the challenge of fiscal consolidation and the management of energy supplies. These aspects of economic policy need to be put at the centre of the national debate if the Coalition is to have any chance of winning. It has to demonstrate that it can wind back the budget deficit without stifling growth.Added to that, Australia needs to be aware that China's economy is starting to falter. It has been heavily dependent on the housing sector, which is now overburdened with debt. If the housing bubble bursts, that could lead to a very substantial decline in China's economic growth, and therefore its capacity to import from Australia.Also, China has substituted some of its grain imports from Australia with imports from Ukraine. A war between Russia and Ukraine would for China impose substantial pressure on imports. I don't expect Russia will attack Ukraine, but this illustrates how there are factors beyond Australia's control that can bear heavily on the Australian economy, and that in turn puts pressure on our economic managers to show common sense and flexibility.On national security, Morrison and Peter Dutton have done an outstanding job in consolidating the Quad, building AUKUS, and garnering international support from other liberal democracies, not least the United States, to help Australia counter the bullying of China. And closer to home, the Morrison government has maintained control of Australia's immigration borders, sticking with the tough policies originally crafted by the Howard government.The Coalition does, then, have good issues on which it can fight an election, but it needs to focus every day on these issues and get away from extraneous debates about transgender rights in the schoolyard or a federal ICAC - I would have thought NSW had demonstrated the dangers of that!Furthermore, the Coalition has to convince the public that it really wants to win, and ministers need to be prepared to go out constantly and argue their corners.Too few of the current ministry are prepared to do that. Josh Frydenberg and Dutton cannot be left with Morrison to do it alone. Far too many ministers are just sitting in their offices drawing a salary and not getting out and selling the government message to the public. There is no point in being a minister if in a liberal democracy you're not prepared to explain your policies and argue your case with the public.The Coalition will also have to craft a suitable negative campaign against Labor. Anthony Albanese is running a zero policy approach, but what does the Labor Party really believe and what would it really do?Since they won't tell us, the government should be free to do so! That includes getting the public to contemplate Albanese as PM.Don't get me wrong, my very limited experience of Albo tells me he's a good bloke. But this is not a man with the intellect, the energy and the charisma to lead a great nation. My sense is the public can see that, and that needs to be driven home by the Coalition.So there is a pathway to victory, but the Coalition needs to get away from issues that have dogged it over the past year or so and concentrate on the issues which are its strengths. And it has to do that with steely discipline and a very visible determination to win. That way, another miracle could happen.Alexander Downer was Australia's longest-serving foreign minister, from 1996 to 2007, and most recently Australian high commissioner to the UK."
