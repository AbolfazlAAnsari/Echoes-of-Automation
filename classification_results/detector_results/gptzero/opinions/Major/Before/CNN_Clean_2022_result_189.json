Why should American citizens easily be able to purchase body armor, other than those who legitimately need it for their jobs, such as security guards?There are some common sense actions that can be taken to reduce the number of mass shootings in the US. Law enforcement officials and teachers need to better understand the issue of \"leakage,\" which was identified a couple of decades ago as a possible predictor of school shootings. It's where a student planning to do something violent often intentionally or unintentionally reveals something about their plans to peers or family members.The Texas shooter texted photos of his semi-automatic weapons and a bag of ammunition to a classmate days before the shooting, according toCNN. He alsoposted picturesof his weapons on social media.\"Leakage\" can also be found in acts of domestic terrorism as was the case of the suspect in the attack at the Buffalo supermarket in a Black neighborhood in which 10 people were killed earlier this month. The perpetrator made a \"generalized threat\" a year before he carried out his attack with an assault rifle that was investigated by police. Despite that threat, he was still able tolegally purchasea semi-automatic rifle.As the conservative writer David French has pointed out, more states should pass\"red flag\" lawsand they should be better enforced. Such laws would prevent the purchase of guns by those like the Buffalo terrorist who had made the threat that had come to the attention of law enforcement.Let's see if anything substantive comes of the tragedy in Texas that reduces the toll of gun violence in the United States. We have all seen too many terrible tragedies unfold and then watched as nothing really changed.Let's hope this time is different. America's mass shootings are a national shame and tragedy and an outlier globally. And they will surely continue if Americans revert to business as usual, which has tragically been the case now for decades.Opinion by Peter Bergen, CNN National Security AnalystTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
