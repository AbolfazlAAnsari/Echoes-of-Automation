The Macdonald-Laurier Institute earlier this month published a serious, substantial paper(https://www.macdonaldlaurier.ca/biology-fairness-trans-inclusion-sport-paper/ ) arguing that \"gender identity (a subjective concept) is a poor basis for sports categories. It is biological sex (an objective fact) which drives the inherent differences in athletic advantage, and which makes sex-based categories in sport necessary.\" Case in point: the recent story of University of Pennsylvania swimmer, Lia Thomas, formerly mediocre male swimmer, Will Thomas, who has destroyed the competition racing as a woman. Said a female swimming teammate(https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/teammate-of-trans-swimmer-speaks-out/): \"Pretty much everyone individually has spoken to our coaches about not liking this.\"Meanwhile, there have been mounting stories of preposterous wokeness in the government-run education system: a draft copy of Ontario's school curriculum including a preamble, since removed(https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/ontario-removes-anti-racism-text-from-math-curriculum-preamble), claiming that mathematics has been used to normalize racism and colonialism; a teachers' union in Halton weighing votes(https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/ontario-teachers-union-implements-controversial-weighted-voting-system-to-increase-minority-representation) by skin colour; the Toronto District School Board initially cancelling(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rex-murphy-toronto-school-boards-profoundly-ignorant-rejection-of-book-club-event-with-nobel-prize-winner) a book club event with 2018 Peace Nobelist and ISIS victim Nadia Murad over concerns about Islamophobia; and so on. Such stories, along with declining educational standards, have made the government-run school system significantly more disreputable. This has not yet translated into policies expanding school choice, but if families increasingly demand alternatives to government-run schools, that may only be a matter of time.Matthew Lau: Some hidden inflation with your fries?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/matthew-lau-some-hidden-inflation-with-your-fries)Matthew Lau: The trouble with Ontario's new auto strategy: It exists(https://financialpost.com/opinion/matthew-lau-the-trouble-with-ontarios-new-auto-strategy-it-exists)Matthew Lau: How not to help the wretched of the Earth(https://financialpost.com/opinion/matthew-lau-how-not-to-help-the-wretched-of-the-earth)In economic policy, as in education, things have gotten worse instead of better. But here, too, there is a potential silver lining. To the extent that unfortunate economic outcomes are clearly attributable to bad government policies, they should bring discredit upon the politicians imposing those policies. As rising public debt, lethargic growth, and high inflation cause significant economic distress, sensible Canadians will increasingly look askance upon woke budgeting, expensive climate piety, enthusiasm for raising taxes, and general fiscal profligacy.As for the socialist doctrines that swept over the business community in 2021, culminating with Mark Carney being declared one of two winners of this year's National Business Book Award, the reasons for optimism may be few. But the opposition to the business community's plunge into climate alarmism, fixation on progressive notions of \"social responsibility,\" and aspirations to collaborate with governments on central planning initiatives, if not exactly widespread, at least continues in free-market quarters, including here at FP Comment and at the Fraser Institute(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/blogs/central-planning-by-business-is-still-central-planning).So, while 2021 was no great year for freedom, advocacy for freedom and free markets carries on, and the tide, at least in some important areas, may well be turning. In the long run, progressive fantasies - about sports, mathematics, education, economics, and everything else - will run into the brick wall of reality. It is only a question of when. Early 2022 would be good.Matthew Lau is a Toronto writer. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved."
