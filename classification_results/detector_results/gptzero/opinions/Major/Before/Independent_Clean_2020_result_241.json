            "inputText": "Please send your letters toletters@independent.co.ukBack in March, Elon Musk told his SpaceX employees that they have a higher risk of being killed in a car crash than dying from the coronavirus. Now the UK's deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, has warned that children are at a higher risk of being in a car crash than of having coronavirus.Doesn't that tell us what a crazy world we live in, and how senseless and destructive we humans are?The first UK pedestrian to be killed was Bridget Driscoll, in 1896. And the first UK driver to be killed was Henry Lindfield in 1898. The coroner in Bridget Driscoll's case said he hoped \"such a thing would never happen again\".Today the annual death toll on UK roads is over 1,500; globally it's over 1.5 million. What will the death toll from Covid be in 2120 - with increased temperatures, hurricanes, and higher sea levels?As humans, we have simple problems and difficult ones. Putting man on Mars is simple. Eradicating hate crime is impossible. And if we look at world records, e.g. 100m races and the marathon, the laws of physics dictate that there's a limit to the speed we can run.But with climate change, there's no limit to its destruction. Therefore, it should be recognised that in all aspects of life - from health care to employment - we have victims of abuse, intimidation and air pollution. And vulnerable road users, and people with lung disease, are victims of speeding drivers!In short, if we can't eradicate road death, we sure as hell won't stop global warming. Hence wouldn't a \"common sense\" message be: \"Save Lives, Protect Our NHS, Speed Limits Are Maximum, Not Minimum?\"Allan Ramsay                                          RadcliffeRussian doubtsI normally agree with John Rentoul but for once I take issue with a statement in his article: \"Sincerity was Corbyn's key strength...\"According to Andrew Murray, Corbyn's adviser, the evidence for Russian involvement in the poisoning is overwhelming. It isn't. The investigation by Bellingcat is odd and suspicious. Even more so is the timing of the events in Salisbury and the prompt arrival of the hazmat team. Nothing about the Skripal affair should be accepted at face value.I realise that John Rentoul has left the statement by Murray without comment. My own view is that no journalist should mention Skripal without leaving the reader room to doubt the official version.Simon Fisher                                          SellindgeSNP needs a new planThe annual furore over the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS) figures is now in predictable full swing. No one has ever seriously uttered the popular secessionist grievance mantra of \"too poor, too small\" with regards to Scotland.But this isn't 2014 anymore. Oil prices have plummeted. Covid-19 is still playing out, in ways that can't be predicted. The global economy is reeling and climate instability is increasing.How much would an independent Scotland borrow, how would the deficit be dealt with (and it would need to be dealt with); increased taxes or a reduction in services, or both? Or neither? How would Scotland be a competitive place for business?The SNP need to start tackling the \"known unknowns\" and \"unknown unknowns\" of Scottish independence with a rigorous, factual honesty that they have yet to muster, lest we all vote for a 21st-century version of the Darien scheme at some point in the future.Surely the people of Scotland deserve better than the \"Nah, it'll be fine\" attitude that the SNP have been pedalling for six years now with regards to Scottish secession.David Bone                                          South AyrshireExtend the Brexit transition periodI read your editorial (These U-turns reveal a flaw at the heart of government) with interest and agreement. I too, in my heart of hearts, knew when Boris Johnson was crowned prime minister by his party's adoring members that this country was in for an unorthodox and bumpy ride. But I hoped I'd be proved wrong and he would rise triumphantly to this high position with good grace, great governance and would not ultimately squander all the goodwill bequeathed him, especially in the momentous and seismic times this country faced.To be fair, a global pandemic was not on the cards but somehow this government has stumbled and prevaricated most steps of the way. As you state, U-turns can signify a fleetness of foot and a willingness to adapt to the prevailing opinions but this does not seem the case here and it is ultimately depressing and concerning in equal measure. Boris Johnson is intractable about sacking ministers and advisers with an almost kamikaze determination. But the beleaguered civil service is presumably completely dispensable. Maybe with this strategy, the government could produce a proactive U-turn and respectively ask the EU if the transition period could be extended, in view of the trade deal negotiations stalling at every conceivable moment. Now that would be a sane, sensible and serious thing to do, not words I imagine that feature heavily in the prime minister's extensive vocabulary, and not even in Latin!Judith A Daniels                                          NorfolkDon't blame the algorithmHaving reached page five of the latest edition of The Independent, I'm suffering from brain overload of how stupid Boris Johnson is.It's clear his Eton attendance - I hesitate to say education - clearly failed to \"level him up\" to anything other than being a half-wit. However, on page five he takes the biscuit. How or why is it impossible to learn something wearing a face mask, as he says, \"You can't expect people to learn with face coverings\"? Does he just open his mouth and let the next bit of drivel come out?Clearly the pupils at Castle Rock High School learned one thing - with or without a face covering - that given this government's policies, it's not so much a \"mutant algorithm\" that's ruining their educational prospects but a mutant prime minister.David Keddie                                          Address suppliedHope in darknessA mass murderer, whose name should never be mentioned again, has been sentenced to life without hope of parole in New Zealand. His guilt was never doubted as he had livestreamed his murder of 51 people and the attempted murder of another 40 people as he shot his way through two mosques in the city of Christchurch.This time of sadness offered insights on the nature of humanity with the evil of one greatly overridden by the strength of faith of the families, many of whom showed no hatred but forgiveness instead. Anger would be the expected response but so many were tempered by their better nature. What the murderer did not understand was that the differences between people is what makes the world a better place.It is often said that tragedies bring people together but why is it at so great a cost?Dennis Fitzgerald                                          Melbourne, Australia"
