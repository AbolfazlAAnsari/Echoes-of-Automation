If women can't decide for themselves whether to carry a pregnancy to term, they also cannot plan their work lives. Being forced intomotherhoodmeans being forced out of work, or at least forced off one's planned track. Researchershave foundthat women who are refused abortions \"experience a large increase in financial distress that is sustained for several years.\"Even highly educated and relatively affluent women -- the type who may be working at a company like Yelp -- may be thrown badly off track by being forced to continue a pregnancy, and will likely facepermanent hitsto their income, not to mention their mental and physical health (the red states that seek to ban abortion also tend to havehigh ratesof maternal mortality, andresearchershave predicted that outlawing abortion could push US maternal mortality rates up by 21 percent).Every person in the US should have a vested interest in keeping women healthy and free, but clearly anti-abortion lawmakers and the citizens who vote for them prefer to keep women's lives small, constrained and controlled.Companies that rely on female workers and want not just a diverse workforce but the most talented possible workforce have a choice to make: Support their workers by paying for their full range of health care and any necessary travel to obtain that health care, and seriously consider whether they want to set up shop in states that go after the rights of women and trans people, or see their talent pool shrink along with the basic rights of women.Opinion by Jill FilipovicTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
