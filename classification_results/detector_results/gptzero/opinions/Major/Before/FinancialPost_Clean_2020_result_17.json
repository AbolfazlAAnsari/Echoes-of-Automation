Contrast that to the ongoing opioid overdose crisis, where it seems politicians are too often seen standing next to the critics of those same public health officials. This is a concerning reality given that approximately 12 Canadians die every day of an opioid overdose.Case in point: the stale debate that continues to surround supervised consumption sites, which have been conclusively proven effective in preventing overdoses and reducing other drug-related harms, while not undermining public safety objectives.In these health facilities, people consume, usually by injection, pre-obtained drugs under the supervision of nurses and trained staff who are able to provide sterile needles and respond to overdoses when they occur. The scientific evidence derived from the evaluation of these facilities is both comprehensive and clear: they save lives. Yet despite the mountains of evidence that's been compiled about their effectiveness, this health intervention continues to be controversial for those who don't know, or willingly choose to ignore, the science.As scientists who worked on the evaluation of Insite - North America's first legal supervised injection facility, which is located in Vancouver - and have studied the scientific literature derived from similar facilities around the world, it is disheartening to see the science ignored by politicians who are eager to score partisan points and prevent safe consumption sites from opening in communities that desperately need them.Here's what the science tells us: not a single death has been reported in a supervised consumption site.

Supervised injection sites were associated with less outdoor drug use, and they did not appear to increase crime or substance abuse. In fact, our study of conditions around Insite showed that there were fewer instances of public drug use, publicly discarded syringes and other injection-related litter in the area after the facility opened. Using crime statistics from the Vancouver Police Department, we also demonstrated that the opening of Insite did not result in increases in drug-related crimes.Dozens of other peer-reviewed studies published in science and medical journals have also shown the benefits of Insite, including how fatal overdose rates sharply decreased in the area around the site.
