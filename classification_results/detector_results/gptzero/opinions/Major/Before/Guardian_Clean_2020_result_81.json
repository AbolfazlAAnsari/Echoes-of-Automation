Trump spoke to them in ways that Biden did not US election live - follow all the latest updatesBiden v Trump: live resultsFew saw this knife-edge US election result coming. But no one can say they weren't warned. Overall, the 2020 election bears a striking resemblance to the one that took so many by surprise four years ago. The belief that 2020 would be decisively different from 2016 turns out to have been based on a very human but ultimately very foolish triumph of hope over experience. In politics, we have been reminded, hope is not power.Four years ago, as now, the opinion polls pointed pretty consistently in one direction. Then, as now, the results did not reflect their confidence. That's certainly the fault, in part, of the polls. But the polls never intend to get the result wrong. They have a vested interest - as do the media that commission them - in getting it right. The problems that the pollsters can't lick is that they don't reach the right people, and that some people tell lies. Or just keep quiet. Who knew?That happened in 2016. Now it has happened again in 2020. Even if Joe Biden wins, it implies that the Democrats were fighting the wrong campaign. Biden was a good candidate, but he campaigned as if the Covid-19 pandemic was the main issue. Millions of liberals agreed.  But the white working-class voters in the rust belt and upper-midwest states who delivered victory to Trump in 2016 have not changed their minds. They elected Trump for all the very serious reasons that quickly became a consensus explanation in 2016: they felt ignored, their jobs and communities had gone, they thought others - including foreigners - were getting too good a deal, and they wanted someone to speak for them. And the Democrats seemed to have stopped doing that.Not much of that changed in 2020, or not as much of it as lots of Democrats persuaded themselves. And, yes, the media too. Too much of the reporting did not take Trump and his voters seriously enough. Those visceral complaints about being left behind, left out, ignored or dismissed as deplorable were still there all along, still deep and still defining. Trump spoke to those complaints in ways that Biden did not, although he was better at it in some ways than Hillary Clinton. Trump's much-stronger-than-predicted showing in those states this time tells us that the determinative experience in this election was not Covid or the death of George Floyd. It was the economy and, behind that, the enduring trauma of the 2008 financial crash and its inequalities.That's not to say Covid was irrelevant. Trump's reckless negligence in the face of the pandemic clearly helped Biden to do well, not least among voters who were going to vote for him anyway. But Trump turned Covid to his advantage too. His brush with the virus in October fired him up for a strong performance in the final weeks of the campaign. In public health terms it was outrageously reckless and irresponsible. But politically it was outrageously brilliant, a performance that brought a kind of hope to millions that they could get back to life as normal and could ignore the virus. In retrospect, much of the media failed to see this, perhaps because they didn't want to believe it.It's not to say that Floyd's death was irrelevant either. If Biden makes it over the line, African American votes will have been crucial. But white Americans, who still make up the majority of the electorate, have again rallied in spectacular numbers behind Trump, especially white men. Hispanic voters, like other minority-ethnic voters, favoured Biden, but Trump has done better here than four years ago. This election has not overcome the historic race divide that makes America different in so many ways from Europe. It has deepened and preserved it.Whatever the eventual outcome of the election, there is one thing it emphatically was not. It was not the watershed moment that most of the rest of the world, and half of America, craved. It was not the cathartic rejection of Trump that seemed tantalisingly possible in the summer. Instead it was another squeaker. It is already another toxic seedbed of future challenges, disputes, investigations, conspiracy claims and lies. It could also be - and there's a pattern in modern American elections here - the third time in 20 years the electoral college may end up handing the White House to the Republican candidate who lost the popular vote.I thought Biden fought a skilful campaign in many ways: relying on his experience and decency, playing the long game, avoiding distractions, keeping the focus on Trump, trying to build a majority coalition and keep it together. But it hasn't delivered a decisive victory. The Senate seems likely to remain in Republican control. There has been no big boost for the Democrats in the house or at state level.This result will have enduring consequences for both parties. If Biden has won, some public policy will change in America and in the world. But not all that much will change inside the party. All the old criticisms about Biden's age and his big-tent politics will soon re-emerge. The socialist wing of the Democratic party will believe that a more radical candidate would have done better. They will be wrong, but that argument is set to smoulder for years to come and to shape the 2024 election, for which manoeuvring will now begin.If Trump has won, he will take no prisoners. Even more than now, he will feel mandated to extend and complete his marketisation of the presidency under the Trump brand. Even more than in the past, other Republicans will define themselves by their fealty to Trump. But even if Trump has lost, Trumpism will have triumphed. Any defeat will be presented as narrow at best and illegitimate at worst. There will be no pause for reflection within the party.The reality of the election is that the United States has shown itself to be, yet again, a 50-50 nation. Half of Americans backed Trump. The other half didn't. In this respect, American electoral politics bears some comparison with other countries, not least Britain. The choice for all such countries is whether the victors try to deepen that divide or to try to heal it. The choice is between government that acts as if the other half does not exist and a government that recognises that the other half exists too. Here again, hope points in one direction but experience points in the other.The enduring importance of that grim conclusion should not be fudged. The result of the November 2020 election is that America has not purged itself of what it did in 2016. It has not turned its back on Trump's climate change denialism, not rejected Trump's racism, not spurned his isolationism, not punished him for rushing to pack the supreme court, not held him to account for his corruption and behaviour. The plain truth is this. Americans did a very bad thing for themselves and the world in 2016 and, whatever happens once the dust has settled, Americans have pretty much done it again in 2020.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist"
