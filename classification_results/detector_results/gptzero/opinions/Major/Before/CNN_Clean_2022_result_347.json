It's surely worse now.The essential problem, of course, is fewer and fewer people watch linear TV. They stream, or watch clips online. The drive to catch Letterman or Stewart every night is not there anymore, especially among college guys, a prime target for late-night advertisers. Audiences for late-night shows are older now, which makes them less valuable in the eyes of advertisers.That doesn't mean late-night shows are going away. The format is too efficient for eradication. The subscription model is still reaching viewers who like late night. Fallon just hit the 30 million subscriber mark on YouTube. Viewers still enjoy selective parts of a late-night show (usually the comedy), but don't commit to watching the entire show when it airs.Maybe the genre will shrink all the way down to just a few shows. Depending on how many entrants leave the arena, the survivors may be able to take advantage of grabbing the viewers still interested in some laughs before bed.Opinion by Bill Carter for CNN Business PerspectivesTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
