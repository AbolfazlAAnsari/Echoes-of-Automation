The advantages are that it costs nothing, it simplifies the award structure and the employee will end up with a far better retirement fund.David CahillNorthwood, NSWInside the education Ponzi schemeJosh Roskam is on the money in relation to our university sector's propensity to privatise gains and socialise losses (\"Don't bail out bloated unis\", March 6), but he got one thing wrong. They are not just certificate factories - they are in fact a de facto form of permanent residence.Retired professors I know have all commented on the relentless pressure to pass substandard foreign students to keep the grotesque education-migration Ponzi scheme going.All sides of politics are in on this scam for their own bankrupt reasons. While there are pockets of excellence, the average output of our universities is so bad I know of some employers who require graduates to sit knowledge tests to sift out the frauds even in subjects like electrical engineering.My all-time favourite is a foreign student with an honours degree in electrical engineering going for a $100,000 job who was asked by the business owner to perform a trade level task of putting a battery pack in a cordless drill and screwing something to a board, but could not work out how to do it in the time allowed. We have passed the point of no return.Peter HaggstromBondi Beach, NSWThe waylaying of service to the publicJames Whelan and the Centre for Policy Development urge the Australian Public Service to serve the government of the day with integrity and provide \"frank and fearless advice\" on questions of public policy, from national security to fiscal policy to social security, across multiple jurisdictions (\"Can the public service save itself?\", March 5).The APS is supposed to deliver \"cradle to grave\" services to the community. The Australian National Dictionary Centre defines a public servant as \"someone who labours for the public good\".The inveterate defence of Scott Morrison's electoral-gain-driven sports grant rort by Philip Gaetjens, head of the PMO, is the antithesis of community service. Australia's top bureaucrat is intent on serving his master despite eroding community trust and goodwill. Self-interested leadership, aka \"feathering one's nest\", risks becoming the APS catch-cry. Regardless of top-down or middle-management formulation, policy that preserves or enhances societal good has been waylaid by Gaetjen's poor leadership.Joseph TingCarina, Qld"
