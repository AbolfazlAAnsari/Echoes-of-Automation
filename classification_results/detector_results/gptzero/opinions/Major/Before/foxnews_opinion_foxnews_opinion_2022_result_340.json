Given this, you would think that the NCAA would recognize this incredible accomplishment and at least equally reward us for tying. Yet instead, they gave Thomas the trophy that day for \"photo purposes\" and assured me that mine would eventually come in the mail. The University of Pennsylvania and the NCAA then subsequently nominated Thomas for NCAA Woman of the Year, the highest accolade for females in all of college athletics.I’m not looking for sympathy with this story, I’m looking for action.President Joe Biden has proposedunlawful rule changes to Title IX replacing \"sex\" with \"gender\" and ‘gender identity’. This is regressive and will strip away women’s spaces, safety, and opportunities — including legally allowing men who identify as women to participate in and destroy the integrity of women’s sports as Lia Thomas and numerous other male athletes have done. Enough is enough.It’s time to take back Title IX and stand up and protect our girls and women. I was gifted Title IX by those who came before me, and I will fight relentlessly to give it to the young girls who have dreams to win at an elite level like I once did.Riley Gaines, Outkick host of \"Gaines for Girls,\" and director of theRiley Gaines Center at the Leadership Institute."
