So it should raise interest rates until it convinces investors that's where inflation is headed.Yet, as the Fed does this it must be sure not to cause interest rates on short-term Treasury bonds to increase above rates on long-term bonds. This so-calledyield curve inversiondoesn't happen often, but when it does, a recession ultimately follows a year or two later. In fact, for more than a half century, a recession has ensued each time the rate on two-yearTreasury bondshas consistently risen above the rate on 10-year bonds. The yield curve is a prescient soothsayer because short-term rates reflect what bond investors think the Fed will do in the near future, while long-term rates show what effect they think those Fed actions will ultimately have on the economy. If investors believe the Fed will increase rates too high too fast and cause a recession, then they push short rates above long rates.Last month, two-year Treasury yields briefly rose above 10-year yields, signaling recession risks are high, but the inversion wasn't long or significant enough to suggest a recession is imminent. The Fed must set interest rates to ensure it stays this way.But even if the Fed gets this balancing act exactly right, that may not be enough. We will still need a bit of good fortune so that neither the pandemic or Russian invasion don't take even darker turns. Given all that we've been through over the past couple of years, we are certainly due.Opinion by Mark Zandi for CNN Business PerspectivesTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
