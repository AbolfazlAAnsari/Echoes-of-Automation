            "inputText": "Sometimes, people don't believe me when I say the schools in much of the US were closed for a year. If you didn't see it up close, it would seem absurd, even impossible.In contrast, there was a parallel pandemic where kids attended fully functioning private schools, in person. In manyred statesandrural areas, public schools reopened in the fall of 2020. Europe and much of the developed worldsent kidsback to school almost immediately after initial Covid-19 shutdowns with minimal restrictions.While there was understandable fear for the safety of students and teachers alike when the pandemic began, dataquickly showedthat schools could reopen safely, and many did, even in a pre-vaccine world. Early findings were then bolstered byfurther studiesthroughoutthe2020-21 school year.Returning teachers and administrators certainly faced risks. They worried for their students, themselves and their own families. But as the school year progressed, the high costs of virtual school led some public-health officialsto change their tuneon the risk calculus,suggestingthat in the time of vaccines and other mitigations, \"teachers need to accept, as other essential workers have, that returning to school will entail some risk.\"Often, Democratic politicians, health and school officials, and teachers unions in some of America's bluest cities and suburbs aligned perfectly in a mission to keep school doors closed for so long. In these places, in-person instruction was deemed nonessential  by the very people who claim to fight for public-school education.Thehigh academicandsocial costsof remote learning and closed schools are now indisputable, but there was also a political cost. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginiacapitalizedon it by appealing to frustrated parents in 2021. He won an underdog race in this increasingly blue battleground state, the first statewide win for the GOP in more than a decade, onthe strengthof improved suburban performance combined with rural base turnout.His opponent former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe'sdefining gaffe-- \"I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach\" -- solidified his party's image as aligned with school boards and teachers unions, as didhis decisionto have American Federation of Teachers head Randi Weingarten stump for him at the close of the race.After that loss, and a squeaker for Democrats in a New Jersey governor's raceanimatedby many of the same issues, the landscape changed. The American Academy of Pediatricsconcludedthat for the 2021-22 school year, the risks of closing schoolsoutweighedopening them -- even in the face of more contagious variants like Delta and Omicron. But the political damage remains for Democrats, who had become the face of school-closure policy.Is it any wonder, then, that in a recent NPR-PBS-Marist poll of parents,60% of parentswith children under 18 favored the Republican Party headed into midterm elections? Education has been a perennial strength for Democrats. A longtime15 to 20 point leadon the issue has dwindled to single digits, with Republicans occasionally leading. The change reflects what Democrats first saw in Virginia, where McAuliffelost a 33-point leadamong voters who prioritized education over less than two months.Much of blue America, which kept schools remote or hybrid for the 2020-2021 school year, conducted an unprecedented \"social experiment\" on children, resorting to lengthy school closures for millions of children -- a tactic not used during other national emergencies or previous pandemics.Now, the results are in from the \"social experiment\" and they are very, very bad, and the people who supported closures are finallyready to talkabout it.\"Remote learning was a failure,\"wrote David Leonhardtof The New York Times, describing theconsensus of researchersand the findings of a new study out of Harvard's Center for Education Policy Research, which compared pre-pandemic scores on a particular national test (MAP) in 49 states and Washington, DC, to pandemic-era scores in high- and low-income districts, in-person, hybrid and virtual learning.\"The main effects of hybrid and remote instruction are negative, implying that even at low-poverty (high income) schools, students fell behind growth expectations when their schools went remote or hybrid,\" thestudy authors write. But they fared better than students already at a disadvantage.Students at high poverty schools \"were more likely to go remote and they suffered larger declines when they did so,\" accordingto the study.Economist Thomas Kane, an author of the study,told the Harvard Gazette, \"In high-poverty schools that were remote for more than half of 2021, the loss was about half of a school year's worth of typical achievement growth.\"This wasn't hard to imagine, and it's just the barest indication of the crisis. Learning loss over summer breaks had been a well-known phenomenon for years before the pandemic, and The New York Timeseditorialized in April 2020that losses from closures of \"weeks or months because of the coronavirus pandemic could well be catastrophic by comparison.\" They were right back then, and closed districts compounded the problem for 12 months, sometimes more.This isn't a small number of students, either.According to Burbio, an aggregator of school and government data,which trackedwhich schools were open and closed throughout the pandemic, 13% of America's schoolkids were still fully remote in April of 2021. That's over 6 million students out for more than a year. Tens of millions more than that were on Zoom school for less time, but still significant portions of a year, while their parents fought to drag recalcitrant school districts back into the classroom.Despite The Times' early warnings, it soon became very unpopular in left-leaning areas to argue for school openings. In Northern Virginia, a school board memberasked parentsif they wanted their kids \"to be alive or to be educated?\" In the Bay Area, a school board memberdisparaged parentsfor \"want[ing] their babysitters back.\"To be as cautious as possible about Covid-19 was considered good and liberal while the idea of opening school wasTrumpian wrong speak, particularly after then-President Donald Trumpdeclaredin July 2020 his determination to push governors to open schools.It became perceived as aprojectof selfish White supremacists and people who desired to sacrifice children. I am not overstating the rhetoric in these areas, where a mix of political conformity, social pressure and exaggeration of risk of Covid-19 to children created a fear spiral and bureaucratic inertia that has lost schoolsmore than 1 millionenrollees and counting.Education Secretary Miguel Cardona responded to this new Harvard study byentirely missingthe point: \"This study rightly quantifies & highlights something that every parent, caregiver, and educator has seen over the last two years -- that the pandemic had a tremendous impact on our children.\"No, the study shows it was not \"the pandemic,\" but bad pandemic decision-making that hurt kids, with almost no gains to show for it.Long-term school closures weren't just an educational disaster, but a mental-health disaster, as  Weingarten of the American Federation of Teachers noted recently.\"Our kids are in crisis,\"Weingarten said. \"And we had a mental health crisis before Covid ... but for two years of disruption, two years of looking at the screens, two years of not having a normal kind of routine and rhythm. Recovery is really tough.\"They are in crisis, a crisis exacerbated by Weingarten herself, whose unionallegedly had extensive influenceover reopening guidelines written by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to emails reportedly uncovered byRepublicanson the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis andFOIA requests. Weingarten says the accesswas just for collaboration, not lobbying.Yet she tweeted in the last week that47% of familiesdidn't feel their kids' education was disrupted due to Covid-19, while linking to the results of anational NPR-Ipsos pollconducted last month. This alleged triumph of American schooling leaves a solid majority on the other side, which is a problem for Democrats.It was a long-cultivated brand of school funding and alignment with teachers unions that earned Democrats' trust on the issue of education. It was pandemic school closings, and the unions' backing thereof, that lost it. Ignoring parent concerns or pretending they're solely driven by prejudice and partisanship will not earn it back.Until Democrats and teachers unions can at least admit that, they can't hope to fix the problems they've caused in the classroom or at the ballot box.Opinion by Mary Katharine HamTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
