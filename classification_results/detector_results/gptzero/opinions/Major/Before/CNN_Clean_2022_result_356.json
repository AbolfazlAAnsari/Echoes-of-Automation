I wanted it to be so huge that no thief in their right mind would attempt to haul it away. In the end, I chose a Rottweiler.This probably sounds absurd to the uninitiated. But Rottweilers --loving, intuitive, eager-to-please Rottweilers-- embody so many of the canine idiosyncrasies that are a natural balm to anyone struggling psychologically. If you work from home, as so many people still do in the post-Covid-19 world, it's easy to spend a day not just indoors, but completely inert.Throw in the apathy that goes hand in hand with many mental health issues, and it's easy to remain paralyzed for days. This isn't possible when you live with an energetic, adoring puppy who's overjoyed by every second you spend with him, and already strong enough to cause your furniture serious damage if you don't keep your reflexes sharp. And not only does that animal get you off your butt, he forces you outside, whether you feel like it or not.Own a dog, and you'll find yourself meandering with him through the park at dawn, unwashed and drowsy-eyed, sharing nods of recognition with strangers. Walk an uncoordinated, bear-pawed puppy in the city, and you'll see grizzled men who used to work down at the docks coo lovingly before describing the neighborhood's whole sticky history to you in vivid detail.You'll momentarily forget the lingering rustiness of your post-pandemic social skills, and you'll learn the names of every local terrier, alsatian and poodle more rapidly than that of any human acquaintance to date. You'll hold your dog's leash extra tight any time a stranger comes near, ready to launch yourself in the path of anyone who so much as considers making off with your beloved.This is why the reports that people are being compelled to part with their pets are so grievous. Of course, pets are a weighty responsibility, cleaning up their mess is revolting and some are more high-maintenance (and expensive) than others. But nothing else that you can buy with money can match the transformations a living, moving, attention-seeking animal brings about.They aren't essential, like theheatingorhousingthat millions in the UK will be unable to afford this winter. But they're not a disposable luxury either, and I find it hard to believe most people who've had to make the awful choice between their pet and other vital resources think they are. The devotion they offer in return for the most rudimentary care can make us when we are about to break.Trends tell stories. This one tells of financial desperation so acute it's forcing people to part with living, breathing lifelines.Opinion by Holly ThomasTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
