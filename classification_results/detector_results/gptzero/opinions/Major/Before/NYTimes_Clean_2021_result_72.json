            "inputText": "In her opinions, Justice Sotomayor explains how Supreme Court cases are part of a larger unfolding story of where the country finds itself.I saw Justice Sonia Sotomayor twice on Monday night.Not in person, but on the big screen during my first postpandemic venture into real moviegoing. She first made a cameo appearance in thetrailerfor a documentary about the career of the actress Rita Moreno, “Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It.” And then, early in the feature film itself, “In the Heights,” her image flashed by when a little girl added the justice’s name to a list of Latina role models.As we left the theater, I turned to my husband for a reality check. Was it my imagination, or did we really just see Justice Sotomayor twice? I had been thinking about her all afternoon, after reading her concurring opinion in a decision the Supreme Court issued that morning. I needed assurance that I hadn’t simply projected my mental image onto the movie screen.Clearly, after 12 years on the court, Justice Sotomayor has entered cultural icon territory, reminiscent of the status Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg achieved before her death last September. But I want to emphasize another, perhaps underappreciated source of Justice Sotomayor’s distinction. She has become the Supreme Court’s truth teller.That’s what she was this past fall and winter, as the court passively permitted or actively facilitated the Trump administration’s amazing“expedited spree of executions,”in her words: 13 in its final six months, the last one just four days before President Biden’s inauguration.Justice Sotomayor was not alone in dissenting from the court’s refusal to grant stays of execution or from its decisions to lift stays that lower courts had granted; Justice Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan often dissented as well. But it was Justice Sotomayor,dissentingfrom the court’s go-ahead for the final execution, of Dustin Higgs, who insisted on naming each of the 13 and noted that the federal government had executed “more than three times as many people in the last six months as it had in the previous six decades.”The case the court decided unanimously on Monday in anopinionby Justice Clarence Thomas lacked the drama of an imminent execution. Even though the small-time cocaine dealer who brought the case lost his Supreme Court appeal, he is scheduled to be released from federal prison in September anyway. The question was whether the inmate, Tarahrick Terry, and thousands of others in his position could benefit from a 2018 federal law called the First Step Act. The law was part of an ongoing effort to address the disastrous consequences of the decades-long extreme disparity between sentences for cocaine in its crack and powder form, with crack having been punished 100 times more severely for the same quantity. Congress in 2010 reduced the ratio from 100:1 to 18:1, and the 2018 law made that change retroactive and authorized federal judges to reduce sentences for some crack offenders.Mr. Terry’s problem was that he had been sentenced in 2008 under a part of the original law intended for lower-level offenders. Under that section, there was in fact no disparity between crack and powder. Congress may well have intended in the First Step Act to make sentence reductions available to this group as well but, as Justice Sotomayor wrote, “Unfortunately, the text will not bear that reading.” She added: “Fortunately, Congress has numerous tools to right this injustice.”While agreeing with Justice Thomas’s analysis and bottom line, Justice Sotomayor refused to sign on to his version of the history of the crack-powder disparity, calling his account “unnecessary, incomplete, and sanitized.” While Justice Thomas emphasized initial support from the Congressional Black Caucus and other Black community leaders for the 1986 omnibus crime bill that contained the sentencing disparity, Justice Sotomayor told a different story. She cited “an extensive record of race-based myths about crack cocaine” and noted that Congress considered no evidence for the 100:1 sentencing ratio. It was simply “the highest ratio proposed,” she said, quoting from a 1996 law review article.“Black people bore the brunt of this disparity,” Justice Sotomayor wrote. “Around 80 to 90 percent of those convicted of crack offenses between 1992 and 2006 were Black, while Black people made up only around 30 percent of powder cocaine offenders in those same years.”She added: “Most egregiously, the court barely references the ratio’s real-world impact and disregards the fact that ‘as the racial effects of mandatory minimums and the crack/cocaine disparity became apparent, the Congressional Black Caucus came together in unanimous and increasingly vocal opposition to the law.’ ” That quotation came from the Pulitzer Prize-winning book “Locking Up Our Own” by James Forman, a Yale Law School professor. Justice Thomas also cited “Locking Up Our Own,” which was published in 2017, but only for its quotation from an official of an N.A.A.C.P. chapter who called crack “the worst thing to hit us since slavery.”Almost exactly five years ago, in June 2016, a dissenting opinion by Justice Sotomayor served a similar purpose in another criminal justice case, calling attention to the world beyond the four corners of a particular legal dispute. The case,Utah v. Strieff, concerned whether evidence obtained during a concededly unlawful police stop should be suppressed. The majority said no. In dissent, Justice Sotomayor noted that “it is no secret that people of color are disproportionate victims of this type of scrutiny” and went to say: “For generations, Black and brown parents have given their children ‘the talk’— instructing them never to run down the street; always keep your hands where they can be seen; do not even think of talking back to a stranger — all out of fear of how an officer with a gun will react to them.” She cited the Black writers Michelle Alexander, Ta-Nehisi Coates, James Baldwin and W.E.B. DuBois in making her point.In fact, the defendant in the case, whom the police had stopped without adequate reason, was white. Justice Sotomayor used his race to good effect: “The white defendant in this case shows that anyone’s dignity can be violated in this manner.”Whether the books she cited added weight to the constitutional argument was beside the point. What Justice Sotomayor was doing in that case, in the case this week, and in numerous cases in between was enlarging the frame within which the debate over the precise legal issues play out. She understands that no Supreme Court case is just a matter of petitioner versus respondent. Each is inevitably part of the larger unfolding story of where the country stands with respect to a particular part of the legal fabric by which we govern ourselves.And she understands something else: that on today’s Supreme Court, she is fated to be on the losing side of many of the issues she cares most about. So her project, it seems to me, is to make legible, for these times and in times to come, the context for the court’s decisions and the consequences likely to flow from them. Winners should do this, too, of course, but these days they often don’t. Losers need to, if they want to contribute something that matters to events they can’t control. Justice Sotomayor’s contribution is to tell us what she knows. Our obligation is to pay attention.The Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.
