According to the Insurance Information Institute, non-life premiums, including P&;C insurance premiums, written for \"Not Free\" countries in 2018 totalled about $317 billion, including almost $6.7 billion in Iran, $9.1 billion in Saudi Arabia, and over $261 billion in China.The insurance industry has also written up non-life premiums worth $16.4 billion in Russia. That's where a court just jailed that country's opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, for three and a half years. This came after the failed attempt - widely blamed on Putin - to murder Navalny with poison in August 2020.It's true that insurance coverage in \"Not Free\" nations is only about 13 per cent of total worldwide non-life premiums. But that misses the point. Canada, a cold, northern country with a massive oil and gas sector, has an impressive record on getting carbon emissions intensity down. Most of the \"Not Free\" nations, in contrast, have done little on carbon emissions - or fudge the data (see: Saudi Aramco) and are not doing anything to improve their freedom rankings.On every other measurement that should matter to insurance executives and their staff the world over, Canada is a beacon of civil, political and economic rights. But Axa, Zurich and Swiss Re are divesting and de-insuring a major Canadian industry while helping autocracies and tyrannies stay in business.Mark Milke and Lennie Kaplan are with the Canadian Energy Centre, an Alberta government corporation funded in part by carbon taxes. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
