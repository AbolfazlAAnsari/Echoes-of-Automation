The pandemic led to a marked decline in the demand for traded goods, largely due to unemployment and decreased travel. Supply chains have been disrupted, various means of trade (including by air) have been hit hard, and some governments have responded with protectionist measures. From January to November 2020, total Canadian goods trade (exports + imports) was almost 12 per cent lower than during the same period in 2019.Still, it could have been worse. The WTO initially forecast an overall drop in international trade of between 13 and 32 per cent in 2020 but has since revised its forecast to just a 9.2 per cent decline in merchandise trade volume, followed by a forecast increase of 7.2 per cent this year. Although a recovery is widely expected for 2021, whether it actually happens depends on policy responses and trends in the pandemic.Such statistics have led commentators to compare COVID-19 to the Great Trade Collapse during the global recession following the financial crisis of 2008. In that episode, global trade declined 12 per cent, while Canada's trade fell 21 per cent in the first year. The downturn marked \"the steepest fall of world trade in recorded history and the deepest fall since the Great Depression\" (VoxEU). Has COVID-19's hit on trade been as bad? Will it be?In this country, trade in goods began to fall last March. In 2008 the decline began in October. The chart displays monthly percentage drops in trade in goods in comparison with pre-crisis levels during both crises. The COVID-induced decline was faster, though both crises resulted in similar drops. Canadian trade has recovered much more quickly during the pandemic than it did after the financial crisis, however. As of November, trade in goods was almost at the same level as before the pandemic, despite having fallen 33 per cent at its lowest point.
