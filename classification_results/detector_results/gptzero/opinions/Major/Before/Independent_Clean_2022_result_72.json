Ukraine today.And let us not look at military juntas installed and supported in South America, namely Argentina, Brazil and Chile, only to torture and murder their own people who did not subscribe to their right-wing dictatorships.As Albert Einstein suggested? If you keep doing the same thing over and over and expect different results, it's a sign of insanity.I venture to suggest that we live in an increasingly insane world.Gunter StraubLondonAn assault on our humanityNo one can fail to be horrified by bombs falling on maternity and psychiatric hospitals, killing and maiming children and pregnant mothers. This has shaken our humanity to the core.However, the west will never have any sway on Russia as long as it is utterly complicit in the wanton destruction of innocent lives and livelihoods, social fragmentation and the murderous shelling of public infrastructures in Libya, Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen, all under the rubric of regime change and the promotion of democracy and justice.America's unequivocal support of Israel, its settlement aggrandisement, land usurpation and the uprooting of orchards, and religious and cultural genocide in the occupied Palestinian territories - weren't these an assault on our mutual humanity?Dr Munjed Farid Al QutobLondonForeign troops in RussiaI have been reading multiple reports that Russia is to deploy foreign troops - Syria has been mentioned - in the barbarous attack on Ukraine, and to show the full picture I also hear there might be some ex-servicemen from European countries assisting Ukraine.If this is the case then I find my mind drifting back to the Spanish civil war of 1936-39, when General Franco deployed troops from Spanish colonies to the mainland, then Italian and German planes wrought devastation on Spanish cities - Guernica springs to mind - and (last but not least) Russian advisers along with the international brigade also played a part in the conflagration.To say this is concerning is, to put it mildly; however, what really worries me is I know only too well what happened after the conflict on the Iberian peninsula finished!Robert BostonKingshill, KentUnderstanding RussiaI appreciate Mary Dejevsky's efforts to illuminate our understanding of Russia and Putin. I was struck by the article about the Kyiv Independent and its mission to publish true stories by first validating their sources and veracity.Ms Dejevsky's suggestion that we may not be getting the truth, or all the truth, is very possibly correct. What I am certain about is that nothing broadcast by Russian media, politicians, diplomats, or other official sources is worth granting a gram of credibility.I have little doubt that certain facts are kept from us for strategically important reasons. That we should have acted over Crimea is beyond doubt. That Russia has invaded a peaceful country on the back of lies and obfuscation is also beyond doubt. While the outcome is far from clear there is one undeniable fact - Russia is suffering in Ukraine and at home.To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by                                                                       clicking hereDo not worry too much about the facts in the news, Mary. We should simply support the Ukrainians as best we can. I have a high degree of confidence that the Ukrainian people will achieve their wishes, no matter what successes arise for Russia. Winning the war is what counts and Russia has bitten off much more than it can chew, even if it does achieve some success in its corrupt mission.Yours,Michael MannShrewsburyUkrainian refugeesMy daughter living in Holland has just taken in a Ukrainian refugee and informs me that they only need to show their passport and they get all public transport free. Despite our government's hostility to foreigners, might we perhaps do the same for the lucky few who manage to obtain visas here?Michael du PréMarlowPoisonous tissue of liesWe could all do to be cheered up in these darkest of times. And what could be more cheering than hearing that Ian Blackford intends to step down from his role as Scottish National Party leader at Westminster?Well, actually that it was a \"poisonous tissue of lies\" and that there was no truth in the rumour. There is now a witch hunt on in the SNP for whoever started it. Let us hope that greater mercy is shown to the malefactors than to Scotland's witches. Otherwise, there will be in time be another case for posthumous pardoning coming down the track.Jill StephensonEdinburgh"
