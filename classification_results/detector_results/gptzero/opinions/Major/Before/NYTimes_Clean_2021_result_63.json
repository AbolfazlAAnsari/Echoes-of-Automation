            "inputText": "Readers speculate about how extraterrestrial beings would view our world. Also: The Wuhan lab; the C.D.C. and mild infections.To the Editor:Re “The Truth May Yet Be Out There,” by Adam Frank (Opinion guest essay, June 2):As a nonscientist, I hesitate to quibble with a professor of astrophysics about the criteria for acknowledgment of extraterrestrial life. However, Dr. Frank addresses the matter as if it can be adequately probed by the application of current scientific and technological tools.Wouldn’t it be safe to say that, whatever might be out there, a few quadrillion miles away from us, is likely to be utterly dissimilar to everything we know with our earthbound consciousness? If so, we literally couldn’t even conceive of that world’s nature or its inhabitants, if there be any.If an 18th-century scientist were somehow to obtain a view of our 21st-century world, what capacity would he have to recognize nuclear power, an M.R.I. scan or Wi-Fi? Or, indeed, the principles behind spaceflight? He would be, as we all are, a prisoner of his paradigm.Extraterrestrial “life” may be no more graspable by science than the charms of music.Simon MarcusOakland, Calif.To the Editor:Adam Frank ignores an important aspect of this issue: the possibility that any extraterrestrials from an advanced civilization visiting us may not be friendly, which should be of great concern to all of us.Let us hope that whatever aliens we encounter do not turn out to be like us — blithely devastating and exterminating other creatures and the biological systems that sustain life on Earth. Even and especially if they are kind and compassionate, they might feel obliged to exterminate such a dangerous and destructive “pest” species as human beings. We clearly represent a threat to most other life-forms on our planet.Our sense of morality and ethics rarely restrains us in our pursuit of domination of animals and nature. Why should aliens treat us any differently?Lewis RegensteinAtlantaTo the Editor:If extraterrestrials indeed exist, the answer to Adam Frank’s question of why they don’t simply announce themselves on the White House lawn may be that they are too far above us in every way to be bothered trying to establish contact with so inferior a life form. Before you remove an ant hill from your lawn, do you try to announce your intentions to the queen ant?Pamela Tamarkin ReisBranford, Conn.To the Editor:It was 1964, as I recall, when two of my brothers, Joe, 15, and Rich, 13, were standing in the driveway of our house in Schenectady, N.Y., and Joe noticed a jet-like noise that caused him to look up. They saw five airborne craft approach and come to a complete stop approximately over our house at an estimated altitude of 1,000 feet. They were oval in shape, silver-gray in color, in a V-formation, and each had a rectangular pattern that looked like an access hatch on its underside.Joe ran into the house to get some binoculars. As he returned, the objects began moving and quickly accelerated to an enormous speed in a flat trajectory. Joe was so astonished at what they had seen that he immediately called the local airport to ask if it had them on its radar. The airport said, “Absolutely not,” and implied that Joe was pulling a prank. Over the last 50 years, I have asked each of them at widely separated intervals to draw what they had seen, and the drawings were always quite similar.Fred BrennionLos AngelesTo the Editor:I, too, am a physicist who works on finding planets around other stars and life on them. While I largely agree with Adam Frank’s essay, many scientific advances have come about through eyewitness accounts of phenomena. One of the more interesting of these stories, whichI have written about, involves meteorites.Ernst Chladni published a book in 1794 asserting that rocks fall from the sky, based on many nearly identical stories spread over time and location. That there were rocks in space was considered absurd at the time, and his book was largely dismissed, precisely because he relied on eyewitness evidence.A few months after the book was published, a large fireball appeared over a city in Italy, and later a 56-pound rock fell in England. Chladni was right, and he helped form an entire subfield of science, based on eyewitness accounts.While U.F.O.s may indeed be explainable, eyewitness accounts by nonscientists ought not be automatically dismissed.Rebecca OppenheimerNew YorkThe writer is a curator in the astrophysics department at the American Museum of Natural History.The Media’s Skepticism About a Lab LeakTo the Editor:Re “Why the Lab Leak Theory Matters” (column, May 30):Ross Douthat presents an argument linking the alleged suppression of the Covid lab leak hypothesis to the media’s anti-conspiracy bias.What he conveniently omits is the fact that, over a period of two years, President Donald Trumpslashed the C.D.C. staff in Chinafrom 47 to 14. Those cut included epidemiologists and other health care professionals. That staff was positioned in China precisely to give an early warning about biological hazards originating there.Yes, perhaps the media should be less doctrinaire in its reporting. But in this case the media should be focused on the decisions of the Oval Office, not just on China.Frank BaudinoAptos, Calif.To the Editor:Ross Douthat gives some reasons that the lab leak theory matters. One is to gain some soft power over China. But to think that China would admit a mistake is like thinking President Donald Trump would. No chance.George SantangeloStillwater, N.Y.To the Editor:Re “The Lab-Leak Theory and the Media,” by Bret Stephens (column, June 1):Far more persuasive explanations underlie the initial doubting of the lab leak theory than “media groupthink,” on which Mr. Stephens lays blame.After President Donald Trump and other loud voices on the right proclaimed thatCovid cases would go to zero, that the president wouldnever let Covid come to America’s shoresor that it could beeradicated with Lysol, their proclamations that the Chinese leaked it seemed as reliable as those from the boy who cried wolf.Similarly, while Senator Tom Cotton might indeed be correct about a lab leak, his colleagues were so wrong about so much that his getting this one thing right would be like a broken clock telling the right time twice a day.Finally, detailed genomic analyses from the Journal of Virology andNature Medicineindicated that the Covid-19 spike protein bound less efficiently to the human host receptor than a previous coronavirus, and less well than a computer model would have optimally predicted. This was (and remains) powerful evidence that Covid-19 was not intentionally constructed.Robert LabarreStamford, Conn.The writer is a cardiologist.The C.D.C.’s Misguided Decision on Mild InfectionsTo the Editor:Re “C.D.C. Has Stopped Tracking Mild Cases in Vaccinated People” (news article, May 26):To fail to study some breakthrough Covid infections as a matter of policy is not justifiable. One wonders at the motivation: optics? resources?In addition to the many negative consequences explored in the article, the opportunity to learn specifically from mild and inapparent infections stands out. The role of such infections in the epidemiology of Covid was among the more puzzling aspects of the outbreak. However, during the darkest times, it was not possible to divert resources to cases not severe enough to threaten the life of patients.But questions remained about case numbers relative to clinically serious infections, their role in transmission, long-term health and patient profiles.Failing to probe these and other questions will limit our ability to manage a still active health crisis and others to come, and to evaluate the role of public health measures as the country opens up.Regina LinderNew YorkThe writer is professor emerita of medical laboratory science at Hunter College.PHOTO:    (PHOTOGRAPH BY Ben Giles FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
