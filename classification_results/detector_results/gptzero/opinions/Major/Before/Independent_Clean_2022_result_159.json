These elements, he proposed, manifested in creating a significant loss of concentration and focus, and thus, undermined productivity. This merely revealed his own failings, inadequacies and lack of self-discipline. Similarly, his idea of leadership, of showing disregard for the rules, probably showed us his preference for the sort of leadership that he believes would have enabled him to flourish in his previous employment opportunities by overlooking his own brazen, unabashed personal and professional untruths.Nigel PlevinSomersetImperial measurements should be taught - as historyQuite right,Ian McNicholas of Ebbw Vale, we should all have the right to imperial measurements. After all, what is a pint but 568 millilitres or a quarter of mint imperials as 113 grams? Just don't waste children's education teaching imperial measurements as anything other than history.Andrew BennettPrayssac, FranceWhatever the future holds, 'The Firm' will rise to the occasionI readEmma MacKenzie's column(The Queen's popularity is phenomenal: what will \"The Firm\" do when she is gone, 31 May) with interest and I watched the crowds massing on the mall to cheer and clap for a diminutive figure but monumental in appeal to many generations. She looked humbled by this outpouring for her platinumjubileeappearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony. MacKenzie is right that as a young woman, she had no idea that she would ascend the throne and take on the task of uniting a country. But she rose to her role and this is what has garnered her so much respect, her innate desire to serve her people and her stoical behaviour to whatever befalls her.Like many people, I have great time for her because she has kept her promise of service through good times and bad. I have a feeling too that the younger royals will step up to the plate and indeed Prince Charles, who was mocked interminably for his comments about the environment has come in for approbation as being ahead of his time. So whatever the future has in store, \"The Firm\" will I think rise to the occasion, although the Queen has set the bar incredibly high.Judith A DanielsNorfolkWhere is the balance in jubilee coverage?I am very much a defender of the BBC. However, coverage of the monarchy lacks any balance whatsoever. When today on Radio 4, on the news, I was told that all feel a sense of participation in the jubilee celebrations, I felt that the coverage went too far: this was a definite untruth. And why wasn't there even a short analysis of the hereditary principle?Cole DavisNorwich"
