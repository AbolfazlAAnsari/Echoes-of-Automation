The psychological impact of the pandemic and the measures adopted has hit both the medical staff working on the front line and the general public.West China Hospital's widespread online psychological intervention aims to connect mental health professionals to healthcare workers, patients and their familiesthrough internet platforms.A similar response should be put in place by the UK government to take care of the most vulnerable. Otherwise, we will feel the consequences of this mental health pandemic for years to come.Aglaia Freccero                                          BSc biomedical sciences undergraduate at University College LondonDomestic abuse is running rampantCovid-19 lockdown measures have made it even more difficult for domestic abuse victims to get time away from their abuser - leaving many trapped in an increasingly volatile situation.The government's \"You Are Not Alone\" campaign to raise public awareness of domestic abuse and signpost resources, and its forthcoming investment in domestic abuse services, is welcome but there is still much more to be done.It is encouraging to see that government guidance for emergency injunctions - which stop abusers harming or threatening victims - now acknowledges that victims may not be able to get time or space away from their abuser to attend a telephone hearing.However, strict legal-aid criteria leaves many victims navigating the process unrepresented. Making non-means tested legal aid available for domestic abuse cases would allow all victims access to legal support.The government should also relax the usual \"gateway\" evidence requirements during the pandemic so that solicitors - as well as busy frontline professionals and doctors - can certify that an individual has experienced domestic abuse and allow them access to legal aid.Every effort must be made to make legal aid more available and work with specialist domestic abuse services to ensure that the new funding is properly targeted and victims are safeguarded during the pandemic.Simon Davis,                     p                     resident of the Law Society of England and Wales, Sophie Linden,                     d                     eputy                     m                     ayor for                     p                     olicing and                     c                     rime, Claire Waxman,                     v                     ictims'                     c                     ommissioner for London, Nicki Norman,                     a                     cting                     c                     hief                     e                     xecutive of Women's Aid Federation of England, Sara Kirkpatrick,                     c                     hief                     e                     xecutive of Welsh Women's Aid, Sandra Horley CBE,                     c                     hief                     e                     xecutive of Refuge, Rosie Lewis,                     d                     eputy                     d                     irector and VAWG                     m                     anager at the Angelou Centre, Suzanne Jacob, OBE,                     c                     hief                     e                     xecutive of SafeLives, Olive Craig,                     s                     enior                     l                     egal                     o                     fficer at Rights of Women, Dr Nicola Sharp-Jeffs, CEO of Surviving Economic Abuse, Pragna Patel,                     d                     irector at Southall Black Sisters and Diana Fawcett,                     c                     hief                     e                     xecutive of Victim SupportDon't speak for all of usSoyour correspondent, John Cameron, wants the right to choose his own fate and be free to expose himself, as an elderly person, to Covid-19.Is he also willing to renounce his right to be treated by the NHS and can he guarantee that he will not pass it on to someone else who does not wish to be exposed to it?With the vulnerable safe, there would be no need for a lockdown of the young and their consequent economic hardship. By the time you are 70 you should have acquired the resourcefulness to live a rewarding life in lockdown. As a society we stop the young from dicing with death by running across busy roads. There are echoes of Brexit in the failure to see that constraints on individuals benefit the individual as well as society as a whole.Jon Hawksley​                                          France"
