Its operational agenda is essentially to overthrow American society, which it deems irredeemably unjust, and build a new one in its place.If Black Lives Matter truly cared about Black and Brown people, it would condemn the Cuban regime with same fervor it currently reserves for the United States.It has made perfectly clear what it wants in this brave new world: A state with the power to punish anyone it pleases, and penitents forced to publicly repent their privilege.What is that vision, if not a Marxist state with struggle sessions? Such countries already exist, like China. Another example is the country BLM refuses to denounce: Cuba.There’s a reason the group’s recent statement condemns the U.S. for trying to \"crush [Cuba’s] Revolution.\" It’s the same reason one of BLM’s founders has stood side-by-side with Nicolas Maduro, the dictator who has brought Cuban-style socialism and oppression to Venezuela.If Black Lives Matter truly cared about Black and Brown people, it would condemn the Cuban regime with same fervor it currently reserves for the United States. That it refuses to do so points to its real goal – the same goal that Marxists have sought since the Russian Revolution and in every Marxist movement since. They want nothing less than power, and they’re willing to obtain it by any means.The proof is playing out on the streets of Havana, Santiago, Camaguey and countless other Cuban cities. In the fight to tear down the U.S., what does it matter if Black and Brown Cubans must be killed in the streets?Josef Stalin may not have actually said \"you can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs,\" but that sentiment animates the leadership of BLM. For them, the suffering of minorities on that communist island nation is not in vain, because it provides an opportunity to further undermine the locus of liberty in the world.By backing Cuba and bashing the U.S., Black Lives Matter is standing in the way of Cuba’s liberation. So are BLM’s allies, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who make similar arguments. Their defense of the indefensible and criticism of their own free country have dangerous effects. It intimidates Americans from supporting the Cuban people and may even block the Biden administration from punishing the Cuban regime for its oppression.Whether Black, Brown or any other color, the Cuban people deserve thelibertadfor which they’re chanting in the streets. The same is true for the American people, who also deserve better than dangerous hypocrisy of Black Lives Matter.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MARION SMITHMarion Smith is president and CEO of the Common Sense Society."
