You might be tempted to assume that in a world in whichgetting and spendingoccupies a large part of everyone’s life, people would have a pretty good sense of how the economy is doing, even if they aren’t familiar with national income accounting. In reality, however, economic perceptions are largely shaped by media coverage — and, increasingly, by partisanship.Indeed, the role of partisan skew has gotten so large recently that the Michigan Survey of Consumers, probably the most influential gauge of economic perceptions,highlighted itin its most recent data release; you might say that the Michigan Survey has warned us not to trust the Michigan Survey. Here’s how consumer sentiment has changed among self-identified Democrats and Republicans since 2019:So when the White House changed hands, Democrats began offering a somewhat more positive assessment of the economy, while Republicans became vastly more negative. In fact, Republicans now have a more negative assessment of economic conditions than they had in March 2009, the depths of the financial crisis, when theunemployment ratewas 8.7 percent and the economy was losing800,000 jobs a month.You might be tempted to say that this divergence in part reflects differences in the kind of people who vote for the two parties: Small-business owners, who are strongly Republican, are suffering from labor shortages, while low-paid workers, who tend to vote for Democrats, are experiencingabove-average wage gains.But other data show a huge divergence between what people say about the state of the economy, which is quite negative on average, and what they say about their own personal finances, which is fairly positive.

Furthermore, to the extent that they see genuine problems, they may not be clear about which problems politicians can solve and which they can’t.Take the price of gasoline, which has risen about $1.50 a gallon from its pandemic lows:Higher gas prices represent a real hardship for many Americans — and historically voters have seemed toblame the presidentwhen gas prices go up.
