            "inputText": "Alireza NaderThe Islamic Republic in Iran is about to execute three young Iranian men for their participation in the November 2019 popular uprising against the regime. But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is no stranger to brutal mass violence. His regime continues to obfuscate its role in the downing of Ukraine Airlines Flight 752 in January, which killed 176 people, including 57 Canadian citizens. Last week, Tehran fired one of its own investigators who claimed the regime kept Iranian airspace open(https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/audio-recording-iran-lead-investigator-flight-ps752-1.5636450__;!!MtWvt2UVEQ!QpI97b7RSU4OLSv_1GHWrvNS6uniDXW5E7XPe6k824j3bxpz8FkLLIP20BMIrgBrWw$) to civilian aircraft, including Flight 752, so as not to give away its plans to conduct military strikes against U.S. forces in Iraq. Rather than acknowledge this reckless endangerment of innocent travellers, the regime still claims the shootdown was due merely to \"human error.\"The regime's lack of accountability reflects Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's failed Iran policy. Trudeau's lack of toughness(https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2020/04/20/regime-in-iran-exploits-canadas-policy-of-engagement-without-pressure/__;!!MtWvt2UVEQ!QpI97b7RSU4OLSv_1GHWrvNS6uniDXW5E7XPe6k824j3bxpz8FkLLIP20BMyWrogIw$) toward Tehran and preference for friendly engagement also calls into question his commitment to the Canadian-Iranian community, especially the victims' families.Trudeau appears to believe that diplomatic engagement and warm gestures toward Tehran can incentivize it to change its behaviour. Trudeau and his foreign minister, FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne, have conducted friendly meetings with Iranian Foreign Minister Muhammad Javad Zarif, but these engagements have achieved nothing of substance. Alarmingly, an Iranian spokesman said the two countries have even discussed re-establishing diplomatic relations(https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-flight-752-1.5621615__;!!MtWvt2UVEQ!QpI97b7RSU4OLSv_1GHWrvNS6uniDXW5E7XPe6k824j3bxpz8FkLLIP20BPoExvU8Q$), which would effectively reward a regime responsible for scores of Canadian deaths.To date, the Trudeau government has ignored calls for significant pressure against the Islamic Republic. For example, defying the recommendation of Canada's parliament, Ottawa has not designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) in its entirety as a terrorist organization. The government also has not investigated the regime's lobbying network in Canada.'Very hard to believe this story': Iran report blaming mistakes for military's downing of PS752 dismissed(https://nationalpost.com/news/iran-report-blaming-mistakes-for-militarys-downing-of-ps752-dismissed)Iranian officials 'looted' cellphones, rings, passports of plane crash victims, Canadian relatives say(https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/iranian-officials-looted-cellphones-rings-passports-of-victims-in-iran-crash-say-canadian-relatives)Trudeau's policy on Iran appears to be animated by political disdain for the Trump administration rather than an objective assessment of Canada's interests. Trudeau notably blamed(https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/justin-trudeau-us-escalation-partly-to-blame-for-iran-plane-deaths__;!!MtWvt2UVEQ!QpI97b7RSU4OLSv_1GHWrvNS6uniDXW5E7XPe6k824j3bxpz8FkLLIP20BM2E839nw$) the Islamic Republic's shooting of the Ukrainian airliner on \"regional tensions\" between the U.S. and Iran, thus placing responsibility partially on Washington.Trudeau's approach toward Iran is also shaped by a desire to make Canada an independent global actor that does not defer to American wishes, which was most notably demonstrated by his recent failed attempt to secure a UN Security Council seat for Ottawa.The Trudeau government's financial motivations should also not be underestimated. Canadian companies such as Bombardier stand to reap billions of dollars(https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.unitedagainstnucleariran.com/company/bombardier__;!!MtWvt2UVEQ!QpI97b7RSU4OLSv_1GHWrvNS6uniDXW5E7XPe6k824j3bxpz8FkLLIP20BNGzfr8kQ$) if another nuclear agreement is reached and U.S. sanctions are eased. Bombardier's sales to Iran Air collapsed, along with even larger deals reached by Boeing and Airbus, when the U.S. designated the Iranian airline in 2018 for its ties to the IRGC.Can Trudeau be compelled to change his Iran policy? The Canadian civil rights organization B'nai Brith has filed a lawsuit demanding(https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.bnaibrith.ca/b_nai_brith_canada_launches_lawsuit_against_federal_government__;!!MtWvt2UVEQ!QpI97b7RSU4OLSv_1GHWrvNS6uniDXW5E7XPe6k824j3bxpz8FkLLIP20BMIYiI-uw$) that Trudeau fulfill a parliamentary motion demanding the designation of the entire IRGC as a terrorist organization. Whether this will work is not uncertain. Canadian-Iranian political analyst Nikahang Kowsar believes that Trudeau cares deeply about his public image and will respond to criticism, especially from Canadian-Iranians and human rights organizations.The Canadian-Iranian community plays an important role in Canadian politics, especially in large cities such as Toronto, and could conceivably sway future elections against Trudeau's Liberals if he is not more aggressive against the Islamic Republic. The families of victims of the Ukraine airliner will be the leading voice on the Iran issue. Their pain and anguish will make it difficult for Trudeau to ignore them.Trudeau's policy of engagement will not produce any wins for Canada when dealing with a regime that best responds to economic and diplomatic pressure. The Liberal party is unlikely to apply maximum pressure against Tehran unless it experiences pressure from the Canadian public, especially Canadian-Iranians. It is time that their voices are heard, loudly and clearly.National Post.
