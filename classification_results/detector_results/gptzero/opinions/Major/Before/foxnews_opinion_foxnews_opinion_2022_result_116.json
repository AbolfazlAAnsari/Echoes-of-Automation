Violent rioting is unacceptable. Political violence is unacceptable.Democrats’ comfort with violent rhetoric and conduct should disappoint you, but it shouldn’t surprise you. Think back further. Remember in 2019 whenRep. Maxine Waters instructeda crowd of angry activists to harass members of the Trump administration if they saw them in person? How about when a crowd of protestors attacked Senator Rand Paul and his wife as he walked the streets of Washington, DC in 2020? Or in 2017, when a Bernie Sanders devotee shot and almost killed Rep. Steve Scalise – along with four others – having been driven to commit unspeakable violence by angry, divisive far-left propaganda?Every American remembers the devastating riots that took place in the spring and summer of 2020. However, Democrats would like you to forget the role they played in stoking the fires of resentment that led to billions in damage and dozens of deaths.Then-candidate Kamala Harrissaid that the riots \"are not gonna stop…and they should not,\" shortly before promoting a bail fund for violent rioters.We all know that there’s a reason we don’t hear much about the left’s pattern of violence: their allies in the mainstream media carry water for them. Who could forget the infamous shot from CNN in which a reporter stood in front of a burning city with a headline describing riots as \"fiery, but mostly peaceful?\" Just imagine the media coverage if a gunman had shown up at a liberal justice’s house instead of Justice Kavanaugh.Nothing can conceal the truth: today’s Democrat party is more than comfortable condoning, encouraging, and demanding violence to achieve its political aims. The American people understand this radicalism for what it is — and they won’t forget it come November.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RONNA MCDANIEL"
