More common are the Republicans whoremain silentas Trump and others spout lies about the January 6 attack and who was really involved.We live in an era of disinformation and conspiracy theories. Trump could be on the cusp, as Jonathan Chaitarguedin New York Magazine, of transforming this disaster into \"a glorious uprising behind which he could rally his adherents.\"As the midterm elections heat up, it is important that Americans are not fooled. The implications of the attack on Congress -- which was directly connected to a presidentially-led effort to overturn the election -- can't be forgotten or excused.Reckoning with January 6 must be a paramount issue on the ticket in 2022 as voters decide which party is best suited to control the House and Senate. The twisted stories about what happened must be continually challenged and the government must do more to ensure that accountability in our democracy won't go by the wayside. The country needs a thorough, nonpartisan investigation to connect the campaign to delegitimize the 2020 election to the violence that unfolded on January 6.Opinion by Julian Zelizer, CNN Political AnalystTM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
