There has been onlyone serious experiment- run by pro-mask scientists in Denmark - which asked 3,000 volunteers to wear masks and 3,000 not to. After two months, 1.8 per cent of those wearing masks caught Covid, compared to 2.1 per cent of those who didn't.The scientists concluded the difference was \"not statistically significant\". Given the vaunted reverence for \"the science\" among crackdown zealots this should have been welcome news, but instead they refused to accept the scientific demand that beliefs overthrown by experiment should be discarded.The fact is that what zealots have is reverence for individual scientists who happen to agree with them: a very different thing. As in the medieval church, some \"scientific\" Covid mantras have been spiritualised and lifted out of the sphere of rational debate.
