They are part and parcel of right-wing, authoritarian \"governance\".There is more than a whiff of the totalitarian about the ban. I fear it heralds worse to come.The British mainstream media seems to me to be overwhelmingly pro-establishment and rank with reaction, but even Johnson's allies there may rue the day they helped him into No 10.Sasha Simic                                          London N16Star Wars droid to the rescue?Yesterday's Radio 4 programme PM gave significant airtime to cover a story that has become only familiar; a group of determined individuals in the outskirts of Bristol were provided with the opportunity to outline their case for protecting three mature maple trees that were threatened with imminent felling.The issue centred upon the conflict of the desired outcome of protecting a resource that is contributing to the environmental and health and wellbeing associated with the acknowledged benefits that mature trees provide, one that is at risk with the local council and developer's need to create much-needed low-cost housing in the vicinity. (The promise, made by the developer of planting at least 20 replacement trees, it was argued, failed to recognise the 20 or so years before the replanted saplings offer any significant benefits in the locality).In the studio, a legal adviser recommended that the best way forward for the protesters was for them to make an application to the local authority, for each tree to be issued with a separate tree preservation order, a TPO, as it is known. This would prevent the trees from being cut down while discussions about the site are ongoing.I may have misheard or misunderstood, but it seemed to me that the protesters were seeking assistance from an original Star Warscharacter; apparently, it would help their cause considerably if they could see Three TPO.Nigel Plevin                                          Somerset"
