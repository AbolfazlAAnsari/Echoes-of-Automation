Whatever has gone wrong, you get a do-over.Christianity is a religionof second chances. It starts in the Old Testament, where God sends prophets again and again to remind his people how to live. And over and over, the people reject the prophets. Still, God never gives up on his people. He continues to invite people to a more loving way of living.Jesus Christalso gave second chances generously. Scandalizing the people of his day, he spoke and dined with notorious sinners. And he challenged those sinners to change, to start over.AFTER A MEDICAL CRISIS, I AM GRATEFUL TO BE ALIVEChristianity also teaches us to give others second chances. One time Jesus has asked how many times we need to forgive others, and he said we should someone who sins against us 77 times (Matthew 18:22). Some translations even say itâ€™s seventy times seven!Jesus was not suggesting we should walk around with little notebooks and stop forgiving on the seventy-eighth offense. Rather, he was telling us that we should forgive people again and again.So what do second chances have to do with the new year?The new year is a natural time to take stock and to try to live differently. I love thatthe churchprovides its own times for taking stock and starting over. Lent is a really good times for this. But since our religion is about second chances, thereâ€™s never a bad time to take stock. Now is as good a time as any.SCOTT GUNN: HOW TO FIND SERENITY IN DIFFICULT TIMESItâ€™s pretty common around now forpeople to make resolutionsâ€” things theyâ€™ll do to improve themselves in the new year. People sometimes strive to eat differently, or use a treadmill more, or something else that relates to physical health or personal appearance.Maybe youâ€™re one of those people. If so, Iâ€™m not here to criticize you. But I would invite you to think bigger. One time Jesus was asked about the most important commandment. Quotingthe Old Testament, he said we should love God and love our neighbors (Matthew 22:34-40).If Jesus said those are the most important commandments, maybe itâ€™s good if we try our best to keep them. This year, what can you do to love God and love your neighbor more fully?I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s right for you, but maybe youâ€™ll work on loving God by reading scripture more or spending more time in prayer. Maybe youâ€™ll love your neighbor by helping those who are in need or giving companionship to those who might be lonely. Youâ€™ll know whatâ€™s right for you.If you make a resolution and fail, donâ€™t worry! Remember, Christianity is a religion of second chances. You can always start over and try again.The amazing truth is that we donâ€™t have to get our resolutions right or do anything else for God to love us.God already loves each of usmore than we can imagine. The reason to try again isnâ€™t to get on Godâ€™s good side, but rather to live out our gratitude for Godâ€™s love. He loved us first, so let us love others.The amazing truth is that we donâ€™t have to get our resolutions right or do anything else for God to love us. God already loves each of us more than we can imagine.The year 2022 was an eventful year for me. After a serious health crisis and amajor surgery, it feels like a great chance to reassess and start over.Scott Gunn is an Episcopal priest and serves as executive director of Forward Movement. He is author of four books, including \"The Way of Love: A Practical Guide to Following Jesus.\"In 2023, Iâ€™m planning to spend more of my prayer time in gratitude and more of my social media time proclaimingGodâ€™s love for us all, you and me and everyone else.So, by all means,get out that treadmillif thatâ€™s your thing. But I hope youâ€™ll also join me in this new year. Letâ€™s try to get better at the most important things â€” itâ€™s all about love. And when we inevitably fall short, letâ€™s give thanks that our God is always ready to give us a second chance or a third chance or a millionth chance.Happy new year!
