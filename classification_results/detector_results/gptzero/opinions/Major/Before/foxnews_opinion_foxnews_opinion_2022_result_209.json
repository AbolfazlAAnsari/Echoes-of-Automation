I publicly shared available information and articles about the district, email exchanges between myself and the district as well as my youngest daughter’s history curriculum.On April 29, 2022, with no prior attempt to contact me, I received a cease-and-desist letter from Elmbrook’s law firm, demanding that I take the site down because it was in violation of the district’s \"intellectual property.\"Anti-vaccine demonstrators protest outside the San Diego Unified School District office to protest a forced vaccination mandate for students on Sept. 28, 2021, in San Diego, California.(Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images)While I did take it down, I do intend to address the district and restore my website in the future. I accessed these materials via public records requests to the Elmbrook School District and at no point, did they communicate the materials were their \"intellectual property.\" It is unclear whether this is just another barrier to prevent transparency in the district.Parents and taxpayers across the country deserve to know what is happening in theirlocal schools. Our districts should publish complete lists of library books and curriculum on their websites and districts should work with parents to find what is best for the students.Public schools are no longer spaces where we can passively rely on the districts’ judgement. We need to be involved, and we need to speak up because, as parents, we are the ones who know what’s best for our children.Julia Crile Zaccaria is a mother who resides in the Elmbrook School District in Wisconsin.Alexandra Schweitzer is a mother and the president of the Wisconsin chapter of the parents group No Left Turn in Education."
