If readers want a true gauge of the grievous human loss sustained, watch Aids Memorial on YouTube.Early on in the Covid hell we are all living through, I told friends at least straights get some sense of what we went through.Tony TugnuttEythorne, KentIs he serious?I had to chuckle on noting thatBoris Johnsonis set to visit Scotland this week in an \"all-out\" bid to save the union.He is expected to use the trip to make a plea, without any sense of irony, for Scots to reject \"narrow separatism\" and hail the benefits of being in the UK.Noting that we are some months away from April Fool's Day, it should be noted that this statement is from a prime minister whose narrow nationalism, driven by his right-wing Tory party, has seen Scotland as part of the UK forced out of a European union of 28 states which comprises the largest single market in the world.Given his appalling poll ratings in Scotland, I would urge Mr Johnson to become a frequent visitor north of the border.Alex OrrEdinburghWait-and-see mistakeIt appears that the government has waited to see for themselves the trends in Covid cases and mortality and this has consistently delayed the actions it has taken.Put bluntly I believe this, together with Boris's wishful thinking, has killed tens of thousands. It will be a while before we know exactly how many.Ironically I believe the lack of investment in the NHS has saved lives. Boris has only acted when he has seen the NHS couldn't cope. Had there been twice as many ICU beds there would have been twice as many active cases before he could see for himself the NHS was about to be overwhelmed.Boris deflecting responsibility by citing the new variant and its increased mortality rate merely confirms he has failed to appreciate that it is his job to understand the numbers and act decisively.Jon HawksleyLondonNaked ambitionOnKeira Knightlyandno sex scenes directed by men, I have long wondered how many would be opposed if the rule was that if the actor is nude, then all those involved behind the scenes were required to be nude also?Joanna PallisterDurham CityRead MoreCounter-terror protection for Covid vaccination centresAnti-vaxxers see Covid as 'historic opportunity', report warnsWe must listen to, not dismiss, anti-vaxxersBoycott independence referendum not approved by UK government - Ross"
