            "inputText": "The COVID-19 pandemic has often been described as unprecedented, even though, throughout history, we have repeatedly witnessed the spread of pandemic diseases - pathogens we still live with to this day.Thanks to improved sanitation and cleanliness, early pandemics such as typhoid fever, bubonic plague and cholera are now rare in most parts of the world. On the other hand, relatives of more recent pandemic influenza viruses - such as the Spanish flu of 1918, the Asian flu of 1957, the Hong Kong flu of 1968 and, most recently, the swine flu of 2009 - still exist and circulate each fall and winter.Only one human pandemic disease, smallpox, has ever been eradicated. Respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are likely impossible to eradicate because they mutate frequently to evade the immune system, they can reside in animal reservoirs and they are widely distributed around the world.Early on in the pandemic, some countries, such as Australia, tried to implement \"COVID-zero\" policies, with the aim of keeping out all cases using mandatory hotel quarantines and travel bans. By July 2020, Australia's deputy chief medical officer declared that eliminating COVID-19 was a \"false hope.\" Today, half of Australia's population is back in lockdown as many parts of the world plow ahead with reopening.Indeed, recent experience with COVID-19 confirms what we know to be true of other viral respiratory pandemics: they settle into the human population with smaller waves over time, eventually causing milder seasonal respiratory illness.The greatest accomplishment of this pandemic has been the development of new vaccines in record time. The fastest any vaccine had previously been developed was four years. In early December 2020, a vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech became the first fully tested immunization to be approved for emergency use. The COVID-19 vaccination program in Canada began in mid-December 2020, with a campaign targeting long-term care (LTC) and retirement home residents and health-care workers.Vaccination of the elderly was the initial priority, given the high rates of serious illness and death in that population. To date, there have been 25,017 deaths reported in those ages 60 and older in Canada, accounting for 93.9 per cent of COVID-19 related deaths.Fortunately, there has been a high vaccine uptake in those ages 60 and older, with over 90 per cent having received at least one dose and nearly 85 per cent fully vaccinated. This has resulted in a significant decline in severe illness and death among LTC residents since early February, despite high levels of community transmission in the spring. Recent COVID-19 outbreaks occurring in these facilities have resulted in fewer infections and hospitalizations, owing to effective vaccines and natural immunity from earlier infections.The COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Canada have been shown to be successful in large clinical trails and this has been supported by real-world data. While vaccines are highly effective in preventing hospital admission, even against the Delta variant, they are less effective at stopping transmission. When disease elimination is likely impossible, the goal of vaccination becomes a reduction of illness severity.Since COVID-19 vaccines effectively reduce disease severity and death, we can move beyond case counting and instead focus on measures of severe illness such as hospitalizations and death. A natural decoupling of cases from hospitalizations has occurred in highly vaccinated populations such as the United Kingdom, Israel and the United States. With high vaccine coverage among populations at greatest risk of severe disease, continuing to follow case numbers becomes irrelevant over time.This has become the case in Canada. Rather than continuing to focus on testing, our resources should be directed toward efforts that focus on vaccinating those at increased risk such as workers in high-risk settings (hospitals, jails, shelters), people with underlying diseases, the elderly and those who are obese.To date, over 80 per cent of eligible Canadians have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and over 70 per cent are fully vaccinated. In Canada, most COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are now among the unvaccinated. Thus, a more balanced strategy is required to allow us to live with this virus.The high costs of repeated elimination attempts and prolonged societal lockdowns have impacted the economy, livelihoods, businesses and the broader health and well-being of our society. Vulnerable populations, including racialized groups, have faced challenges such as housing and food insecurity and mental health concerns.Children and youth have also been significantly impacted. The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto has noted an increase in demand for mental health services, including eating disorder admissions, psychiatry admissions and mental health crisis visits.The benefits of elimination attempts have greatly diminished with rising vaccination rates and more effective treatment strategies for COVID-19. Accepting life with COVID-19 will require a shift in thinking. Health is about more than just the coronavirus, and we need to begin to take a broader view of our overall health and well-being.We have largely overlooked causes of preventable death during the pandemic, including overdoses, which have increased dramatically. Modelling has suggested that missed screening and the resulting delays in cancer diagnoses could result in an additional 8,094 cancer deaths in Quebec alone between 2020 and 2025.If we accept COVID-19 as an endemic virus, we should not be surprised with small periodic and seasonal rises in hospital admissions and even occasional deaths. It is a usual occurrence for our hospitals to become busy with seasonal respiratory viruses in the fall and winter. Our knee-jerk reaction should no longer be to close large sectors of society, including schools, now that at-risk adults have been vaccinated, or have access to vaccines.We are no longer in an acute crisis thanks to vaccines, natural immunity from earlier infections and improved treatments. We need to recognize that not all measures used to control the spread of COVID-19 earlier in the pandemic are necessary at this time.Good hand hygiene and staying home when sick are practices that should be here to stay. The use of COVID-19 testing where there is a direct impact on patient care, such as in hospital settings, will continue to be important, as will sentinel testing (testing random samples of a population), which has been done for decades.Otherwise, we need to remember that mitigation measures such as masking and social distancing have not been routinely used to control common seasonal respiratory illnesses. Given what we have achieved with vaccination rates in Canada and the corresponding decrease in hospitalizations and deaths, the risk of overwhelming the health-care system has been reduced and public health management can shift to an endemic approach.According to the World Health Organization, \"health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being.\" It is time to prioritize the overall health and well-being of our country.National PostAlanna Golden is a practising primary care physician and general practitioner in oncology in Toronto.
