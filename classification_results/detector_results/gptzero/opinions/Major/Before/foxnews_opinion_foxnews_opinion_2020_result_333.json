He thinks it could happen in the next two or three weeks. We discussed him living at the hospital or one of the hotels near the hospital that has been provided for healthcare workers so they can remain away from their families while working on the front line.I asked my husband how he feels about this virus and the situation we are in, and he said one of the most frustrating things for medical personnel is not only how fast this virus spreads, but also how long it lives on surfaces outside the body and, once inside the body, how it attacks the cells.

They fear to lose their savings, their retirement or even their homes in the process.  When I hear about a bailout for the airline industry, I get it. But where is the bailout for the health care industry? For health care workers!?Looking at China and South Korea, we know that someday we will all be on the other side of this virus. When that happens, I hope all of you remember the true heroes in this fight against COVID-19. It’s not politicians, but scientists, nurses, volunteers, techs, paramedics, EMTs, physician’s assistants and doctors, like my husband, who made that all possible. I hope you never forget that, America. This doctor’s wife never will.BY LESLIE MARSHALL   "
