Appeals and counter-appeals wound up before the Ontario Court of Appeal, which, in a contemptible decision in 1949, sidestepped MacKay's ruling and claimed that barring those of Jewish, \"Negro or coloured race or blood\" was only to make sure those owning land were of \"a class who will get along together.\" There was nothing \"criminal or unusual\" about any of this, the court assured.It wasn't until 1950 that Ontario banned the covenants in a bill that saw unanimous support. \"There is no place in Ontario's way of life for restrictive covenants,\" pronounced then-Ontario premier Leslie Frost. Later that year, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down all forms of racial and faith-based restrictive land covenants as invalid.Flash forward to today. While no barriers by race appear in law, bigotry and systemic racism still exist. This week, the Ontario Human Rights Commission (which arose from the battles undertaken by the WEA and CJC) identified, through its Human Rights Tribunal, that systemic racism continues unchecked, causing much harm.As noted by Ena Chadha, the new chief commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission: this past March, a six-year-old Black girl was racially discriminated against when police restrained and handcuffed her at school.And: in 2018, Black youths had to prepay their meals at a Toronto restaurant.These are but two examples of systemic racism that were thankfully dealt with under human rights law. But racism continues unabated. This is not a time to take our eyes off the ball. Much work remains to be done. Justice for racialized communities does matter. We all have skin in this game.Canadian Jewish RecordOpinion: Mark Zuckerberg doesn't care about Holocaust denial(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-mark-zuckerberg-doesnt-care-about-holocaust-denial)Lloyd Wilks: The 'slow drip' of systemic racism(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/lloyd-wilks-the-slow-drip-of-systemic-racism) !@COPYRIGHT=© 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.
