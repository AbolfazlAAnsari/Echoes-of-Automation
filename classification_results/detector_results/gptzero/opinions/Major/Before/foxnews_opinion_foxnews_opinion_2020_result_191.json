It withheld until after the election the knowledge that e-mails linking Joe Biden to his son Hunter’s foreign business schemes were authentic.Despite the different topics involved, the fundamental mistakes are similar. The Times runs afoul when it shapes stories to make the truth appear what reporters and editors want it to be. When facts don’t fit, they are ignored or massaged.Baquet’s description of what went wrong in the \"Caliphate\" podcast could apply to the other cases as well.\"We fell in love with the fact that we had gotten a member of ISIS who would describe his life in the caliphate and would describe his crimes,\" he told NPR. \"I think we were so in love with it that when we saw evidence that maybe he was a fabulist, when we saw evidence that he was making some of it up, we didn’t listen hard enough.\"\"Love\" may sound like an odd word in the context, but journalists with zeal for a story often act like people madly in love. Blind to flaws and drawbacks obvious to others, they race ahead convinced of their own righteousness.Putting the brakes on zealousness is why rigorous standards were created at the Times more than a century ago. Rules demanding fairness, accuracy and impartiality aimed to keep stories straight and win public trust.Baquet eliminated those standards in 2016 when he gave reporters free rein to trash Trump in virtually every story. Although the daily dose of Trump hate brought increased revenues, the more enduring result is a collapse of public trust in the Times.Not coincidentally, the number and scope of major screwups has also ballooned. That’s what happens when you stop being a newspaper and become an activist chasing social and political agendas.FROM MICHAEL GOODWIN   "
