            "inputText": "The Jeremy Meeks phenomenon is the latest episode in America’s long romance with the mug shots of criminal suspects.A YOUNG man faces the camera, shaved head, white tee. The rigid lines of the jaw and cheekbones are softened by the gentle curve of full lips. The hard tattoos slashing up the neck are sweetened by the fading teardrop inked under one eye. And those eyes: pale blue and looking directly at you.It’s the mug shot that launched a thousand memes and hashtags, from #hotfelon to #FelonCrushFriday. Those baby blue eyes belong to one Jeremy Meeks, age 30, arrested last month in Stockton, Calif., on felony weapon charges. When the police department posted his mug shoton its Facebook pageon June 18, the response from around the world was staggering.By last week, Mr. Meeks’s photo had drawn more than 101,000 “likes,” close to 13,000 shares and nearly 27,000 comments, almost equally divided among those extolling Mr. Meeks’s desirability — “Momma, I’m in love with a criminal” — and those condemning the extollers for their shallowness, their immorality, their hunger. “Seems to be no shortage of ladies who wouldn’t mind being Bonnie to his Clyde lol,” one commenter noted wryly.Accompanying the social media response has been finger-pointing commentary about the insidious nature of the Internet, the assault on privacy, a stunning decline in values. But the Jeremy Meeks phenomenon is only the latest, loudest episode in America’s long romance with the outlaw mug shot.From the iconic images of Butch Cassidy and his crew to the gangster mug shots in 1920s and ’30s pulp magazines, from the introduction of the F.B.I.’s most-wanted posters in 1950 to today’s click-bait online mug shot slide shows, we have always sought the chance to gaze at accused criminals.Social media has merely enabled us — via Mugshot Mondays, Pinterest boards and Tumblr feeds studded with arrest photos — to make public our once-private thoughts, posting them for the world to see.In the 19th century, when police departments began inviting citizens to view photographic “rogues’ galleries” to seek help in locating criminals, they quickly realized that the large crowds were not coming for civic duty alone. During the Depression, when true-crime magazines profited by running stories on public enemies like Pretty Boy Floyd and Bonnie and Clyde, the F.B.I. began deploying mug shots to try to counteract the romanticization of bank robbers as Robin Hoods and to encourage the public to feel invested in their capture.But the mug shot also has murkier functions, including both public shaming and public relations. Today, police departments and the news media have realized the power of the mug shot to draw interest, to attract clicks. It turns out that Americans still want to look into the mysterious eyes of the accused, and wonder. Even dream.I remember, at age 8, first seeing one of the famous John Dillinger mug shots, taken after hisTucson arrest in January 1934and six months before his dramatic death. While in some mug shots Dillinger looks sheepish or annoyed, in this one he looks defiant, wearing what appears to be a sneer. Humphrey Bogart famously modeled his gangster characters after him, so I’d expected something akin to Bogie’s familiar face, his movie star smoothness. But Dillinger looked rougher, meaner. I felt like I’d been tricked by Hollywood and was uncovering something far more real. I saw menace in his twitchy mustache, his squinting eyes. Eyes that felt like a taunt.So it was with Mr. Meeks. “OMG those eyes are piercing through my soul,” wrote one Facebook commenter, echoing thousands more. “His eyes are what melts your heart,” wrote another commenter. Others saw in them a con and a hustle: “Beautiful eyes. But such emptiness in them. I’ve seen that look before. Stay far away ladies.”His tattoos evoked just as much speculation — especially that teardrop, which to some was an ominous signal that he had murdered: “That teardrop! Did he leave some poor mother crying for her child?”“Devil beauty,” chimed in another. You could almost hear the troubled whisper.Such is the enduring power of the mug shot to transfix, upset, tantalize. Is that winsomeness in his expression, head tilted as if wronged, pleading eyes, begging for understanding? Or are they the eyes of a lethal seducer, heavy with gang ink and ready to break your heart? Is he a common criminal or a living reminder of a larger societal crisis? For all those whose past experiences led them to see regret or misjudgment in Mr. Meeks’s face, there were others whose tangled histories made them see only abuse, manipulation, loss. Mug shots permit us to project our own desires and fears onto an image that can’t talk back.But what about when the image does talk back? In jailhouse interviews, Mr. Meeks has seized the chance to try to change the narrative. “I just want them to know that this is really not me,” he told local ABC affiliates, his voice trembling slightly. “I’m not some kingpin.”“I’m not what the police portray me to be,” Mr. Meeks said on “Inside Edition” a few days later. “I’m a family man, a husband, I’m a father and I’m a hard worker.” Claiming that he had quit the gang life seven years ago, he said that he now worked in a warehouse for minimum wage. But “Inside Edition” did not verify the assertion, or even dwell on it. The fantasy is so powerful that Mr. Meeks’s actual life cannot be permitted to disrupt it.Both interviews were shot through prison plexiglass, Mr. Meeks’s voice tinny through the phone. His words spliced and diced. It seems a canny metaphor for the mug shot itself. The relationship between subject and viewer forbids communication. He’s rapping on the glass and trying to tell us, You don’t understand. I’m not who you think I am. Listen to me. And we’re on the other side, deaf to his entreaties. The roar over here is too loud.He’s our smooth criminal, our deadly gangbanger, our lost young man begging for reform — whatever we want him to be. And far more than any police photographer, we’ve caught him. We’ve captured him. He’s ours.The author, most recently, of the novel “The Fever.”PHOTOS: Jeremy Meeks, left, in a police booking photo after his arrest on June 18 in Stockton, Calif.; right, John Dillinger in a police booking photo after his arrest on Jan. 25, 1934, in Tucson.
