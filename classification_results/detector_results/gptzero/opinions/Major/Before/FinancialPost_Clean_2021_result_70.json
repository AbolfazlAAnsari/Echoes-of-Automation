            "inputText": "By Veldon CoburnVaccine hesitancy could hinder the response to the pandemic in Canada, and news coverage is telling us that it is partly because Indigenous people are more resistant to inoculation compared to others. The truth is much different, but it departs from the narrative of the Indigenous population as wounded and broken people at the centre of some pity projects.For those who attach their sense of self-worth to their status as allies for Indigenous causes, a feel-good story of saviourism and righteous indignation certainly fits the bill. And when there is nothing of the sort to awaken do-gooder sensibilities, why not just make it up? As some voices from history tell us, never let a good crisis go to waste and never let the truth get in the way of a good story.Now the story seems to go that Indigenous people need special care and attention during the COVID vaccination program because of their experience at Indian Residential Schools and a general distrust of all things white and western. Because of this history and their general disposition towards medicine and health care, Indigenous people are not nearly as accepting of vaccination against COVID-19 as the rest of Canadians. The historic wounds of colonial history remain unhealed and, if we are to accept the Whiteman's medicine and get through this pandemic, we will need extra coddling - just like children.But the truth is, the Indigenous population doesn't need pampering by woke saviours. We are, for the most part, fairly savvy when it comes to our health and we are smart enough to discern the distant past from what's happening in our lives today. Yet you wouldn't know this when reading recent headlines.Global News ran with \" 'There is a lot of mistrust': Researchers look at vaccine hesitancy among Indigenous Canadians(https://globalnews.ca/news/7687069/vaccine-hesitancy-indigenous-canadians/).\" With a similarly sensationalist headline in The Tyee, \"'A Matter of Trust': The Grim Reality Behind Indigenous Vaccine Fears,\"(https://thetyee.ca/News/2021/02/17/Grim-Reality-Behind-Indigenous-Vaccine-Fears/) a non-Indigenous academic is quoted - with no awareness of the paternalism - as saying, \"if I was an Indigenous person, I would definitely have reasons to be wary.\"The reporting offers no current data - beyond some exaggerated anecdotes - to support the broad claim that vaccine hesitancy is a problem within the Indigenous population, let alone a discretely Indigenous issue. What's more, it reaches into sensitive corners of Indigenous existence to needlessly exploit the legacy of residential schools. And it takes a very long reach to go back to events cited in the reporting, such as nutritional experiments in the 1940s, to make the connection to today.Even if we entertain the idea that residential schools and medical experiments did have adverse effects on Indigenous attitudes towards immunization, there is plenty of recent data to show that Indigenous people are now very much vaccine accepting. Residential schools and events that date back almost 80 years are simply far too remote to explain current Indigenous attitudes towards getting the jab.Oddly, some of the reporting treats vaccination as a novel and uncommon event for Indigenous people. But between the times of residential school atrocities, including medical experimentation on children, immunization has become a relatively routine health-care measure. Today we can get vaccinated for a variety of illnesses - such as Hepatitis A &; B, shingles, typhoid, and meningococcal disease - while we shop at big box stores with pharmacies, like Costco and Walmart. Getting an injection is no longer experimental health care.If there is any lingering stigma of medical barbarity, it is difficult to ignore the considerable countervailing trends that have normalized vaccination for recent generations. For decades now, children have been given numerous vaccinations - in numerous doses - throughout much of their early years into early adulthood.As legal minors, these same children have been given a battery of vaccines despite their own attitudes towards needles and irrespective of their individual consent. Childhood vaccination is not just the norm, but in some places in Canada it is also legally compulsory. Since 1982, both Ontario and New Brunswick have required mandatory vaccination of minors attending school.We are a long way from the 1940s - unfortunately this needs to be pointed out because the passage of several generations is enough time for significant changes in attitudes and knowledge. Since that time Indigenous people have become considerably vaccine-accepting. But you don't have to take my word for it. As I pointed out in The Conversation(https://theconversation.com/contrary-to-sensational-reporting-indigenous-people-arent-scared-of-a-covid-19-vaccine-156444), from which this article partly adapted from, there is plenty of recent data that dispels the myth of the fearful Indigenous person, cowering from western healthcare.Research from one of the more recent pandemics to impact Canada - the 2009-2010 H1N1 outbreak - is much more representative of contemporary Indigenous attitudes towards vaccination. In late 2010, Health Canada commissioned a survey of First Nations living on-reserve and Inuit about their knowledge, perceptions, awareness and behaviours relating to immunization.When asked about childhood vaccinations, about 97 per cent of First Nations living on-reserve and nearly 94 per cent of Inuit indicated that these immunizations were important.When both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people were asked about their attitudes towards the seasonal flu, we see that there isn't much of a difference in vaccination acceptance. From the 2017-18 Canadian Community Health Survey, 55 per cent of Indigenous people had a seasonal flu vaccine (excluding H1N1), compared to 59 per cent of non-Indigenous people.And when asked about the relative frequency of the seasonal flu vaccination, 36 per cent of Indigenous people and 42 per cent of non-Indigenous people said their most recent shot was within the last two years.So how did we get the Indigenous vaccine hesitancy myth? What's interesting to me - as both an Indigenous person and a researcher - is the source and motivation behind these distorted representations of Indigenous people. From my own experience, there appears to be a segment of self-anointed allies with an innate desire to be connected to victims, so much so that some will manufacture their victimhood and then pose as the guardian. We, as Indigenous people, are presented as constant victims and our ally-caretakers garner attention and adulation for saving us.It is particularly concerning to see these narratives produced by proud \"settler allies\" who seem to view Indigenous life as a childlike state of existence in need of parental protection from wider Canadian society. There is a sort of social suffocation that comes with these zealous allies. Their clinginess sometimes goes beyond mere irritation. There is a strong feeling of co-dependency where our constant state of victimhood and delicacy gives meaning to the lives of ultra-woke saviours. It is a sort of social Munchausen By Proxy.While there are many meritorious struggles that Indigenous people continue to face, we aren't always the unsuspecting victim. The need to position us in a state of perpetual oppression can have some ugly consequences. Having now been tarred with the same brush as anti-vaxxers, I can only imagine a post-COVID future where Indigenous people have to cope with similar stigma.Veldon Coburn is an assistant professor at the University of Ottawa's Institute of Indigenous Research and Studies !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
