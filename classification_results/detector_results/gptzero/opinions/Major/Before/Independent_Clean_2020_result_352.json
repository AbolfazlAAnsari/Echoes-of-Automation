BarlowWirralIn his letter on Monday, Michael Clarke points out that Europe goes beyond the EU, and mentions eight countries to which his \"attachment extends\" ('Europe goes beyond the EU’, Letters, 27 December).It is worth noting that four of these have links to the EU, which we have rejected, and three are seeking membership. That leaves just Russia with which we can identify. It does indeed go a long way beyond the EU… in many ways.Robert GouldEdinburghSeveral of your letters urge the rest of us to congratulate the PM on his “deal” and to “stop whingeing” about leaving the EU (Letters, 27 December). I’m not clear why I should be impressed that someone has negotiated me a poorer economy, and a more insular life.But on the latter point I have endured more than 30 years of whingeing from Brexiteers blaming the EU for everything in life they didn’t like. I plan to spend the next 30 years saying “I told you so”, and blaming Brexit for everything. It seems a fair payback.Eric WolffRoyston, HertsRead MoreOur cultural retreat from Europe is as concerning as economic threatsIt’s time to leave Brexit behind – we can’t fight yesterday’s battlesThe end of the Brexit negotiations mean we can all come together again"
