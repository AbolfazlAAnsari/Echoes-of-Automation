In America, with more than 300 million people and masks often not being worn, there are over 100,000 new cases a day.I know it is a world of fake news, but this is simple - wear a mask and save lives. Please.Dennis FitzgeraldMelbourne, AustraliaPutin's performanceI read your article concerning \"All Russian Covid vaccines are effective, claims Putin\". This statement from Putin became apparent after companies Pfizer Inc and BioNTech announced the success of their Covid-19 vaccine and how this would be administered.Arguably, his statement stems from his drive for dominance in the competition between Russia, the US and China on the world stage.However, is Putin trying to impress his home audience to show Russia is still a player on the world stage, or is he performing to the rest of the world?Is the announcement and roll out of the vaccine before it has undergone phase three testing enough to reassure the Russian population or could it prove to be more harmful than beneficial?Martha AireyNewcastleRead MoreNo Brexiteer should be disappointed that Biden has won the electionCoronavirus has played havoc with our human rightsIt's time big tech keep their promise to give back to societyHow Biden should deal with Republicans refusing to concede"
