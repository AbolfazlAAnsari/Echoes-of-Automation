It is, however, at best a simulacrum for the democratic deliberation occurring in legislatures, owing most notably to the very institutional limitations of courts. The court process is adversarial: it must always be initiated by an interested party, and no matter the number of interveners (third parties that make legal arguments to assist a court) allowed to participate, litigation remains a bilateral dispute, between two parties or sets of parties defending adverse propositions. Courts are well-placed to make determinations in this kind of setting, including for the purpose of determining whether a particular individual's rights have in fact been infringed. But they are not well-positioned to make the kinds of determinations that are truly implied in the phrase \"democratic self-government.\" This should not be a surprise, for in Canada, judges simply have a different role and mandate than elected representatives.This brings us to an alternative understanding of Section 1, and back to Singh's original argument. If this clause permits limitations of Charter rights, then how should we comprehend those limits? The answer, in short, is that Section 1 is less a means of balancing individual rights against the collective will expressed by a legislature, and more a recognition that all Charter rights possess internal limits. In referring to \"reasonable limits,\" Section 1 affirms the simple truth that the scope and content of rights must fall within reason: unbounded, expansive assertions of rights that are not amenable even to reasonable limits are, in a sense, not rights at all for they are opposed to what is right. In other words, it calls for courts to determine whether a legislature has reasonably specified the scope of a right, given the interests and values pertaining to a particular context.On this reading, far from deserving to be abolished, Section 1 ensures that Charter rights remain tethered to the constraints of reason, which animates the system of rights in the Canadian legal order.Special to National PostStÃ©phane SÃ©rafin is Assistant Professor, Faculty of Law, Common Law Section, University of Ottawa.
