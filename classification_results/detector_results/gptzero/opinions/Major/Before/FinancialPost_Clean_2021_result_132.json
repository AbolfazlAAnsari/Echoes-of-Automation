Governments of different stripes have offered comparable incentives in the past, but this program has a unique twist: it tells Canadians which energy systems they can use.If you own a natural gas furnace, and want to upgrade it, you are out of luck - even if your efficiency choice can be shown to reduce emissions. Why? Because Ottawa is only prepared to extend support for efficiency upgrades involving electricity technology. This is despite the fact that over 20 million Canadians use natural gas every day across the country.In insisting you use electricity, the government is reducing consumer choice, undermining market competitiveness and closing the door on innovation. It will also very likely drive-up energy prices and reduce reliability.Canadians have three main energy delivery systems: a liquid system (gasoline, diesel and alternative liquid fuels), a gaseous system (natural gas, propane, renewable natural gas, and - an emerging option - hydrogen), and an electric system (hydropower, nuclear power, natural gas, coal, oil, wind, and solar, more or less in descending order of use). These systems all work well, and often in an integrated fashion. Combined, they have given us extraordinary energy security in Canada. We all start the car, flip the light switch, turn on a thermostat or run hot water or the barbecue without thinking about what's behind these simple everyday actions.To varying degrees these systems also compete with one another. That competition helps keep the organizations that run the systems eager to improve their performance, increase their reliability, lower the cost for customers, and reduce their environmental impact and GHG emissions. On the last point, companies across all three of those energy systems are working hard to find ways to reduce GHG emissions to try to meet the demanding targets government is setting.But if government starts telling Canadians \"this is the best way to meet our targets,\" it destroys that competition, sending a signal that only the electric system matters. What does government know about the innovative ideas coming forward from thousands of people in the broader energy business? Very little. If it knew more, it would not try to stifle their creativity.But stifling creativity is what the federal government is doing with its efficiency grant: telling Canadians to choose electricity options, and only those. This has the most significant impact on the natural gas sector, so let me focus on gas-electricity comparisons here.The electric system is the more expensive energy delivery system in virtually every application in the country. Ask people who heat their home or run their business with natural gas, and they can tell you about the savings: hundreds and even thousands of dollars less per year for a homeowner.The electric system is also consistently less reliable. How many weather events can you remember where you lost your natural gas supply? I suspect very few. Whereas having the lights go out is a familiar occurrence for many Canadians.Emission reductions can also be achieved through the gas delivery system. Renewable natural gas (RNG or bio-methane) is being recovered across the country from landfills and wastewater plants and can be produced from agricultural and forest waste. Once cleaned, it can be used like conventional gas, and it is cheaper in almost every application than renewable electricity. The gas industry's Natural Gas Innovation Fund (NGIF) is leading the way on innovations with fuels (like RNG and hydrogen) and a host of technologies to improve environmental performance while maintaining the industry's affordability and reliability advantage.Opinion: Now do you see the value of pipelines?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-now-do-you-see-the-value-of-pipelines)Opinion: Canadians crave normal - not bold plans to restructure the economy(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-canadians-crave-normal-not-bold-plans-to-restructure-the-economy)Gwyn Morgan: It's time for leaders who won't buy China's lies(https://financialpost.com/opinion/gwyn-morgan-its-time-for-leaders-who-wont-buy-chinas-lies)Jack M. Mintz: Once again commodities are coming to Canada's rescue(https://financialpost.com/opinion/jack-m-mintz-once-again-commodities-are-coming-to-canadas-rescue)We all need electricity, and we have a remarkable electric system in Canada, but it meets only about 20 per cent of our energy needs. The natural gas system meets over 35 per cent. Replacing the non-electric parts of the energy system with more electricity would cost trillions of dollars. Our 2019 study suggested, conservatively, that the bill for getting the electric share of the mix up to around 60 per cent would be up to $1.4 trillion. That's $1.4 trillion, i.e. $1,400 billion - about two-thirds of annual GDP. And that was the easier part of the challenge.The Canadian Gas Association hopes the government amends the eligibility criteria for its Canada Greener Homes Grant and corrects the perception officials have given that they only want an electric delivery system. Canadians deserve energy choices, and our country is better off with them.Timothy M. Egan is president and CEO of the Canadian Gas Association. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
