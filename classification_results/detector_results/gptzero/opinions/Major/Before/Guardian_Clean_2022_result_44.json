He has united progressive opinion, from the revolutionary left to the liberal centre, in praise of hisdeft and devastating media interviews– almost all of them in the face of hostile questioning.In part this is simply because Lynch is a brilliant communicator and strategic thinker, as would be expected of the leader of a union whose cadres have long been noted for their acuity, intelligence and determination. But it is also because millions in Britain find it refreshing to hear a socialist perspective on current events articulated with clarity and conviction. Lynch puts the case for collective action with a precision and a lack of moralism that is both appealing and vanishingly rare. He also points out the harm done to workers and consumers by excess corporate profits: a blindingly obvious point that almost no mainstream commentator makes.As a media phenomenon, the most immediately striking thing about Lynch is that he seems to subvert some of the more tedious expectations of contemporary political culture. Balding white men of around 60 are no longer expected to espouse radical politics; and if they do, they are absolutely not supposed to do it in an accent that marks them as coming from the southern English working class. But these expectations have always been based on cliches and stereotypes, deliberately cultivated by a political and media class that has marginalised the political left for decades. Many of us, when wehear Lynch talk, don’t hear the voice of a unique new celebrity, but of people that we’ve been talking to and learning from all our lives. We should question why we hear their voices on British TV so rarely.It’s important to approach an issue like this carefully. On the one hand, historians such asSelina Toddhave pointed to the decline in the general presence of “working class” people from various areas of public life – the arts, politics, the media – since the high point of the 1970s. This is partly a direct consequence of defeat of organised labour by Thatcherism. Conservative commentators at that time hated the fact that trade union leaders had become household names, and no aspect of our current culture would have pleased them more than the fact that this is no longer the case.On the other hand, the nature of social class itself is complex and constantly changing. The expansion of universities and graduate employment has meant that far more people are effectively recruited into the professional classes from non-professional backgrounds than was once the case.And so, since the 1980s we have seen the consolidation of a professional class of senior managers, politicians and media operatives, who tend to share a culture and an outlook, whichever political parties or institutions they may be attached to. Its members tend to be socially liberal, but also utterly committed to the assumption that socialism, and even traditional social democracy, are political philosophies that died with the 20th century. This social group draws members from among the privately educated and from the most successful products of state education, and it occupies the positions of power in many institutions today: from the BBC to the parliamentary Labour party.What it doesn’t tend to include is manycommitted trade unionists, many people whose vowel-sounds haven’t been honed at elite universities, or many who are willing to put corporate profits into question when giving interviews about the nature of price inflation.
