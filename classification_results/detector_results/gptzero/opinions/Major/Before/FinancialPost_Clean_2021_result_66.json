            "inputText": "If Health Canada has its way, this year vaping will be dealt three knockout blows that will see, not just the end of the business as we know it, but an increase in smoking-related deaths nation-wide. Ottawa is recalibrating the delicate equilibrium between harm reduction and youth use of nicotine. It plans to introduce a mandatory limit on nicotine concentration in e-cigarettes and to ban most flavours. Maximum permissible content is currently at 66 milligrams per millilitre; the new limit will be 20. Eventually, we will see strike three: excise taxes.Harm reduction tries to induce smokers to switch to nicotine products with greatly reduced toxins, particularly if they are habituated or even addicted to nicotine. Public Health England has repeatedly stated that the toxins in e-cigs are at most five per cent of those in regular cigarettes. The toxins that cause cancer come from the burning of tobacco at 700 degrees Celsius. But vaping devices heat rather than burn. Nicotine is not the health demon. It does cause habituation. But it's the burning that shortens lives.E-cigarettes are not harmless. The health problem vaping poses is that between five and 10 per cent of teens are regular vapers and nicotine is bad for the developing brain. But while a pack-a-day smoker will on average lose 10 years of life, an equally indulgent vaper might lose just one. Most adults who drink moderately, gamble, like sugar too much, or exercise insufficiently might think one year off a normal lifespan a reasonable price to pay to indulge a passion or need.E-cigarettes come in different strengths. Some teens like the buzz of the high-nicotine variety, which give almost as much nicotine on average as a combustible cigarette, making them a close, though less toxic substitute for cigarettes. But the fear that vapers will migrate to cigarettes is overblown. Young vapers who get a hit from nicotine have little incentive to switch to a mode of consumption that yellows teeth, produces bad breath, creates odors, stinks up clothes and causes cancer. Some small percentage of vapers do migrate. But the relationship is rarely causal. Negative teen behaviours are what are called \"common liabilities\": if you are inclined to engage in one, you are likely to engage in the other, as well.Opinion: Think the vaccine shortage is bad? Wait until you see what price regulations do to our drug supply(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-think-the-vaccine-shortage-is-bad-wait-until-you-see-what-price-regulations-do-to-our-drug-supply)Opinion: On plastics, Canada needs to listen to the science(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-on-plastics-canada-needs-to-listen-to-the-science)Opinion: Non-COVID patients paying ultimate price for health-care backlogs(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-non-covid-patients-paying-ultimate-price-for-health-care-backlogs)Vaping is therefore not generally a gateway to smoking. Quite the contrary: data indicate a reverse gateway: smoking rates among teens are now down to just a few per cent, having dropped sharply since 2017. Vaping has written the obituary for cigarettes among teens. Teens have re-weighted their sin portfolio in favour of less toxic activities. Today's daily vapers consume about one fiftieth the toxins their daily-smoking parents consumed at the same age.But could a reduction in nicotine not reduce dependence among youth? There is no scientific evidence suggesting that halving the nicotine content will prevent habituation. We know this from decades of experience with light cigarettes.As for adult smokers, people considering a transition from smoking to vaping require a product yielding enough nicotine to satisfy their craving. Many potential switchers will not make the transition - and will end up dying prematurely - if they cannot get a strong enough nicotine substitute for their cigarettes. Canada has about 40,000 smoking-related deaths per year, so if even a small percentage of smokers don't transition because of insufficient nicotine, that will mean thousands more deaths annually.Under a nicotine cap, some smokers will not transition to vaping while some high-nicotine vapers will go back to smoking; others will vape more nicotine at lower concentrations, although they will have to spend more to get the same amount of nicotine. Many vapers likely will migrate to devices with a higher vapour yield. The \"genius\" of both Juul and Vuse is that they yield high nicotine content at low temperatures and vapour volume. Devices that yield more vapour at lower nicotine levels operate at higher heat. That's a problem. Higher heat generates more toxins, even if the toxins involved are still an order of magnitude less than cigarette-toxin levels.Then there is the question of illegal markets. Canadians have a rich history of ingenuity here, and it would be foolhardy to think a black market will not spring up. In a grey market, vapers might add pure nicotine to their juice, but that is exceedingly hazardous.Is there a solution that would both limit youth use and encourage smokers to switch? Unless youth access to tobacco is more heavily controlled a reduction in nicotine will do little to inhibit teen use. Health Canada is short of inspectors and too many rogue retailers sell to under-age buyers. And some teens will always procure nicotine from older peers. Our objective should be to reduce youth use to the extent possible, just as we try to reduce - rather than eliminate entirely - the use of a whole variety of drugs.If Health Canada succeeds in introducing both a nicotine cap and a flavour ban on vaping, smoking rates will continue to be higher than necessary and many thousands of unnecessary deaths will follow.Ian Irvine is Professor of Economics at Concordia University. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
