All of this inconveniences and even harms patients greatly.In true Canadian fashion, Quebec is an exception, thanks mostly to a 2005 Supreme Court ruling, Chaoulli v. Quebec, which found the government can't ban private health care while rationing public care to patients. As then-Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin wrote: \"Access to a waiting list is not access to health care\" - which you think would be true outside Quebec, too.My friend Beth is just one of 2.9 million Canadians(https://secondstreet.org/2022/11/09/2-9-million-canadians-waiting-for-surgery-scan-specialist/) who languished on a health care wait list according to Freedom of Information responses from provincial governments and territories released to think tank SecondStreet.org(https://secondstreet.org/ ). Since some provinces didn't respond with complete data, SecondStreet.org(http://secondstreet.org/ ) conservatively estimates that at least 3.7 million - or one in every 10 Canadians - is on a health care waiting list.William Watson: Sharm el-Shakedown. More money for the UN black hole(https://financialpost.com/opinion/william-watson-un-climate-change-cop27)Matthew Lau: Trudeau knows even less about entrepreneurship than monetary policy(https://financialpost.com/opinion/matthew-lau-trudeau-entrepreneurship-monetary-policy)Opinion: WTO COVID-19 discussion could chill Canadian innovation(https://financialpost.com/opinion/wto-covid-19-canada-innovation-ip)Sadly, some patients are even dying(https://secondstreet.org/2022/08/15/waiting-list-deaths-spike-in-ontario/) while waiting to receive a diagnostic scan or meet with a specialist, never mind getting to the point where they've been put on a surgical wait list. According to data also collected by SecondStreet.org(http://secondstreet.org/ ), between April 2018 and December 2021 a total of 26,875 patients died while waiting for surgery or other health procedures. Details on these deaths are incomplete but the majority appear to be cases where a patient died waiting for care that could have improved their life (e.g., hip surgery) rather than saved it (e.g., heart surgery). There certainly are cases, though, of critical interventions delayed too long. Beth and I have a friend, Wayne, who passed away from colon cancer while he waited for a colonoscopy.The good news is that just as Beth prepared to buy airline tickets to Toronto to get her hip replacement out of province, a call came through and she ended up having it done in the public system in Calgary - following a 26-month wait. She's delighted with the outcome and while she's still using a cane for stability, she anticipates being able to get rid of her cane in the next couple of months.According to the Fraser Institute, waiting times between referral from a general practitioner and treatment have steadily increased since 1993, when it began tracking them. They currently stand at about 26 weeks or half a year. COVID(https://financialpost.com/tag/covid-19/) made wait times even longer but they have been growing for decades.In October, SecondStreet.org(http://secondstreet.org/ ) hired public opinion polling firm Leger to ask Canadians about health care reform. It found that the majority of respondents - almost two-thirds of Canadians - support copying a European Union(https://financialpost.com/tag/european-union/) policy that gives patients the right to reimbursement from their governments for planned surgeries they have to get out of province. A majority also support governments hiring private clinics to provide surgeries for patients in the public system - where the patient would not have to pay out of pocket.Canadians are ready for health reform. How about our politicians?Licia Corbella, former editorial page editor at the Calgary Herald, is a contributor with SecondStreet.org(http://secondstreet.org/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
