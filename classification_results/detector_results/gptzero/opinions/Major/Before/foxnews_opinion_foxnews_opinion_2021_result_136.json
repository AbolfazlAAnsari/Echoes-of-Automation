This research has shown that even temporary exits from the workforce have long-term adverse effects on future earnings and employment prospects. So, for the 3,000 families enrolled in the L.A. program, the long-term effects of the short-term cash payments could be very harmful.Daniel L. Heil is Policy Fellow at the Hoover Institution.(Hoover Institution)Economics aside, the program’s supporters wrongly presume that it doesn’t matter whether individuals achieve a level of material well-being through their own efforts, or from government handouts.This belief ignores a crucial facet of living a fulfilled life: efforts and sacrifices to achieve a personal goal are essential to a person’s sense of self-worth.Striving to reach a personal goal, more than achieving a level of material well-being, provides life’s true rewards.The L.A. program’s failure to understand this key aspect of human nature is perhaps its most significant shortcoming.The program’s supporters may say that it is only a pilot program, but this ignores the tendency of small pilot programs to grow into large entitlements. One example is the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Formerly known as Food Stamps, this program began in 1962 as a pilot program. It has since  become a permanent entitlement that now provides monthly assistance to 40 million people.Everyone should care about the plight of the poor. But a no-strings-attached government handout is not the way to help them.More than a century ago, the social reformer H.L. Wayland wrote that to truly help the poor society needs to understand that \"It is not bread they (the poor) want, it is soul; it is not soup (they need), it is spirit.\"L.A. city officials would be wise to follow Mr. Wayland’s advice instead of trying to solve the poverty problem by simply throwing more money at it.John F. Cogan is the Leonard and Shirley Ely Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution."
