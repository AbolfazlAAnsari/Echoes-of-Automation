The Earth and all its human and non-human inhabitants depend on it.Mimi                     Bekhechi                     , director of international programmes, People for the Ethical Treatment of AnimalsChris Grayling for a knighthood?Since the publication of the latest honours list, I have been trying to recall the name of the most glaring omission. It came to me last night while lying in bed unable to sleep. Chris Grayling.He is surely as worthy of a knighthood as IDS. What has happened to the famous British sense of fair play, and where is the campaign to rectify this deplorable oversight?In a semi-related thought, it occurs to me that even if we revive our sense of fair play honours-wise, we will obviously have to suppress it again to satisfactorily kowtow to American sensibilities trade deal-wise.Tony Baker                                          Thirsk, North YorkshireCummings, smarten up, pleaseI have no intention of applying to Dominic Cummings for a job until he stops dressing scruffily. He looks more suitably attired to join a litter-clearing party on the beach around these parts than to enter Downing Street for work every day.He will have to spruce himself up a lot more before receiving the benefit of my weirdness.Edward Thomas                                          Eastbourne"
