It is not. It is about speech control over the internet.If you get an electronic version of this thing we call a newspaper, you will have noticed that many articles and columnists now appear by means of embedded video. According to the federal government, video and audio over the internet are \"broadcasting,\" and if you broadcast you need a licence from the CRTC - either that or be \"exempted\" (a term of art) from the need to be licensed by the same agency. Do newspapers understand they are broadcasters?If you speak through the medium of video you are \"broadcasting\" within Ottawa's interpretation of the Act and are subject to ferocious penalties for doing so without a licence - as well as to taxes and other conditions even if you do get exempted. True, the Act would exempt those who upload content to a \"social media service,\" so your tweets would be subject only to such censorship as Twitter imposes, but if you run a podcast or a video download from your own site, you are a \"broadcaster.\" And social media will be regulated by other planned legislation, so don't think your postings will escape government supervision.For many years the CRTC has claimed video sent across the internet is a form of broadcasting, but so far it has had the good sense not to press its luck in the courts by actually trying to regulate video and audio across the internet. To the CRTC and its broadcasting clientele, the internet is a fundamental challenge to the survival of a nationally controlled broadcasting system. In C-10 we see once again that if you can't beat a new business model, you make it illegal. Or if you prefer, you \"extend\" and \"embrace\" the internet by defining video and audio transmissions through the internet as \"broadcasting.\"The defenders of the Broadcasting Act and its revisions will say the remedies they propose will not cost much and won't hurt a bit. They envisage the CRTC using its powers to figure out what could be regulated and what should be left unregulated. But their fundamental proposition is stunning: that freedom of speech through video or audio should be in the hands of the CRTC - including Canadians' freedom to use the internet to reach audiences and markets as they see fit.In practical terms, because of how the CRTC Act is constituted, one chairman and two commissioners constitute a hearing panel. Thus three political appointees could extend CRTC jurisdiction over speech through video and the other commissioners could do nothing about it. He who hears decides.At the moment there are four to five thousand licensed entities under the Broadcasting Act. C-10 envisages that millions of websites and forms of internet communication would in principle be subject to broadcasting licences if they used video. They would be exempted, says C-10, \"if the Commission is satisfied that compliance [with the Act] will not contribute in a material manner to the implementation of [Canadian] broadcasting policy...\"The freedom to communicate across the internet is to be determined by political appointees, on the basis of no other criterion than what is conducive to broadcasting policy - and, presumably, the good of our domestic industry. As always, the interests of the beneficiaries of regulation are heard first, best, and last. Consumers and individual freedoms count for little when the regulated sector beats its drums.William Watson: Do we really want social media to be publishers?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/william-watson-do-we-really-want-social-media-to-be-publishers)Aaron Wudrick: A Netflix tax is a solution in search of a problem(https://financialpost.com/opinion/aaron-wudrick-a-netflix-tax-is-a-solution-in-search-of-a-problem)Peter Menzies: Don't mess with the internet - especially at a time when we need it more than ever(https://financialpost.com/opinion/peter-menzies-dont-mess-with-the-internet-especially-at-a-time-where-we-need-it-more-than-ever)Broadcasting report proposes to wreck the internet with insane hubris and mad regulatory overreach(https://financialpost.com/opinion/broadcasting-report-proposes-to-wreck-the-internet-with-insane-hubris-and-mad-regulatory-overreach)And the right of Canadians to freedom of communication by video? Forget it.That everything communicated by video across the internet should be seized in principle by the Broadcasting Act and then \"exempted\" on whatever conditions the CRTC desires is not new. It is at least as old as the CRTC's first \"new media\" hearing in 1998. As Peter Grant, representative for the broadcasting industry, told the Commission: \"I think it would be a real mistake to recommend that all of this stuff that is broadcasting just be taken out of the Broadcasting Act and defined away from the Act or out of the Act. The result of that will be for Canada to lose control of ever getting it back.\"For the narrow clique of broadcasters, CanCon producers, and their lobbyists, it is always all about broadcasting. For Canadians, however, it is about the right to use the internet to communicate. We do not need to have our freedom of speech squelched by a government determined to protect an obsolete industrial structure.Forget about \"broadcasting\": C-10 is clearly intended to allow speech control at the government's discretion. Ignore the turn signals, look at where the wheels are pointed. They are pointed at your right to communicate freely by means of the internet.Timothy Denton is a former national commissioner at the CRTC (2009-2013).
