            "inputText": "Premier Doug Ford wants more people to get tested for COVID-19. If their experience is anything like mine, it's going to further undermine confidence in the public health system.I was swabbed at Toronto's Sunnybrook hospital on Wednesday, May 20, around 1 p.m., and initially, I was impressed with how it all went.Over the Victoria Day long weekend I had developed a very mild, dry cough and maybe a hint of a sore throat. On Friday, I had to take a Tylenol for a headache. Under normal circumstances, these symptoms would be so mild they'd entirely escape my notice. I wouldn't cancel social plans or take time off work for one little dry cough every five or six hours. But of course these aren't normal times, and if asymptomatic infections are a thing, then maybe my symptoms were so mild as to be borderline asymptomatic.I got tested on the advice of Telehealth Ontario, and because I wanted peace of mind. I live alone in an apartment building, which means I can't leave the building without touching multiple public surfaces. I didn't want to hunker down in a small bachelor apartment for 14 days on a \"maybe\" and I figured that my test would be a useful data point for public health officials tracking the spread of the virus.The clinic itself was quick and easy. I was in and out in less than an hour, including paying for parking. The swab was extremely uncomfortable - both nostrils! - but it was fairly quick. The doctor wearing full PPE said I'd get a call with test results in 48 hours, maybe sooner if I checked the MyChart(https://www.mychart.ca/ ) website where Sunnybrook uploads test results.People line up to enter the COVID-19 Assessment Centre at Sunnybrook hospital in Toronto in a file photo from March 17, 2020.When I got home, I posted a couple of messages to social media describing how quick and easy the test had been. I encouraged other people to consider getting tested, if they had any symptoms.On Thursday, I very carefully entered my information to register with MyChart, and after the third attempt with an error message, I was told that I'd been locked out. I called the tech support number, and the voicemail message said I'd get a call back within two business days. That's not especially helpful, since I was expecting a call back with my test results within 48 hours anyway, but so it goes.Friday 1 p.m. came and went with no phone call. Around 6 p.m. I got tired of waiting, and called Toronto Public Health. After wrestling with their phone tree for a bit, I managed to get a public health nurse on the line. She offered to set up a profile for me, and check if my results had been uploaded to their system.This was a frustrating conversation. I'd been expecting a result within two days, because that's what the doctor told me. But apparently Toronto Public Health says test results can take \"up to four days.\" I was also told that even with a negative test, I was obligated to self-isolate for 14 days, because false negatives are a possibility. So much for peace of mind.The nurse said she was seeing some sort of error message when she checked my test results, which probably meant they hadn't been uploaded yet. As we were talking, the Toronto Public Health phone line was garbled, and our conversation was cut off. The nurse called me back about half an hour later and told me she'd been talking for several minutes before she realized we were disconnected. Then a short while later we were disconnected again. She called back about an hour later. The end result of the conversation was that I just needed to sit tight and call back in the morning.She gave me a phone number for the COVID-19 clinic at Sunnybrook, and suggested I pursue the issue with them directly. I called multiple times, but it always went straight to voicemail. I left three messages at that line over three days.On Saturday I called back and got a different nurse, who said she'd look into the situation and get back to me. Mid-afternoon my phone rang and I scrambled to answer the call, only to be met with silence. Twenty minutes later she called back again and apologized because her line had accidentally been on mute. It didn't matter much, because I still had no test results.On Sunday, four full days after the doctor told me I'd have test results within 48 hours, I called Toronto Public Health a third time. This time, the operator had trouble because my birth date on file was incorrect. Somewhere along the line somebody had missed a keystroke, and put in a 13 when it should've been a 14. How this happened defies comprehension, because my birthday is correct on my health card, and the last two nurses had used that information to verify my identity. After a bit of confusion, this third operator said he'd call me back.I missed his mid-afternoon call, but it wouldn't have mattered anyway. He left a voicemail saying that their servers were having problems, making it impossible to retrieve test results, but if I called back on Monday, he'd certainly help \"troubleshoot\" whatever \"glitch\" was happening in my case. He gave me his direct line, and asked me not to share it.Samples sit in cold storage after testing for COVID-19 at a testing facility in Toronto on May 5, 2020.All three of these Toronto Public Health nurses were calm, and clearly cared about helping me. They were doing their best, and all three made the effort to follow through. But after three different problems across three days, my confidence in the system was fading.Monday morning was the last straw. I called back, and the operator said that their servers were working again, but the incorrect birthday was still causing an error message. He said it was probably a problem on Sunnybrook's end, and I should call the clinic. I told him I'd already done that twice, with no callback.He was stumped. There was a long pause. Then he suggested I might try another avenue as an absolute last resort, but he warned me that it was labour intensive and cumbersome. Then he very gingerly suggested that I could file a freedom of information request to get my test results. I politely told him that I was a journalist, and if my only avenue to get test results was to file a FOI, I had other avenues I could pursue. He was very understanding, but didn't have much else to offer.About half an hour later, after yet another phone call to Sunnybrook, and another voicemail message, I got an automated email saying that my test result was negative. It was only 116 hours after the doctor told me I'd have the results within 48 hours.On Tuesday, when it was all a moot point, both MyChart and Sunnybrook called me - six days after getting swabbed, five days after calling MyChart and four days after leaving my first message with Sunnybrook. I relayed a brief version of my experience to the Sunnybrook caller; she apologized and said she'd pass along my feedback to her manager.This whole experience has demolished my confidence in the province's ability to fight this pandemic. I am only one case, but my impression is that after two and a half months of lockdown, the testing system is a disorganized mess. I was already carrying a lot of stress from social isolation and confinement, because I live alone in a small apartment. I also have the same baseline anxiety as everyone else from the pandemic and economic catastrophe we're living through. The testing ordeal was not good for my mental health, and I'll spare you the details.Ontario Premier Doug Ford puts on a mask at the opening of a new Daily Bread Food Bank in Toronto on May 25, 2020. Ford is encouraging all Ontarians who suspect they may have COVID-19, or who may have encountered someone with the virus, to go for a test.On Sunday, Doug Ford stood in front of TV cameras and implored more Ontarians to get tested. Apparently the province has excess testing capacity, which is a wild thing to hear when it took me five days to get a result. I was assured by more than one of the Toronto Public Health nurses that they'd never seen a case like this. I was also told that this sort of foul-up was probably caused by that typo when entering my birthday.I sincerely hope that's true. We need more testing, urgently. But speaking from experience, when you get tested you also want results - urgently. You want a system that inspires confidence, that delivers on what it promises. Assuming the delay was indeed caused by a typo, no one caught it despite several opportunities.If other people have an experience like mine, they'll be left with the inescapable conclusion that our governments are failing - their systems are a mess.James McLeod is a reporter for the Financial Post..
