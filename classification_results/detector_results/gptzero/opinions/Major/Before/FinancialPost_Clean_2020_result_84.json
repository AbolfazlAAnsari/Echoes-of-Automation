If our testing strategy isn't evidence-based and doesn't adhere to some modicum of fiscal responsibility, we will essentially be flying into a storm without a navigation system in place.At the very least, making top-down changes to our public health system and testing strategy can be done fairly easily. The hardest piece of the puzzle to control is society at large. We have tried to regain some semblance of normality, despite the changes made to our daily lives. We yearn for social interaction, a meal at our favourite restaurant and the comforts of our daily lives.An incredibly co-ordinated effort by citizens to remain in lockdown over the spring successfully flattened the curve during the first wave, and the doomsday scenarios of early models never materialized. However, with ongoing public pressure even with low case numbers, we are left with the new challenges of COVID and alarm fatigue when the public is needed the most.Messaging has become confusing, as we have been asked to restrict our household contacts, but are still able to engage in meals with 100 people indoors without a mask. Imposing restrictions on high-risk environments may reduce some transmission, but without an acknowledgement that a lot of transmission occurs in private settings, this may not achieve its intended goal.Any new restrictions and advice requires people to understand the rationale, otherwise, fatigue and resistance may emerge. Public education needs to promote individual risk mitigation, the ability to have some of our interactions in a safe way and teach people how to protect themselves against transmission in personal spaces.Our health-care system is also a key player, given the need to preserve capacity for COVID-19 care, but also clear the backlog of procedures that built up during the lockdown. A well positioned health-care system would not be strained by the current number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but our health-care system has been running above capacity for years. The need for funding for surge capacity, co-ordinated care models in hospitals and ambulatory care, along with technologies to improve patient care, are paramount, and should be a priority.The restrictions introduced over the weekend only address a small facet of our underlying vulnerability to another wave. They may offer a temporary solution, but they are not sustainable. While long-term planning may seem costly and resource intensive, the consequences of lockdowns are costlier. Without a roadmap back to normalcy that addresses the multidisciplinary needs highlighted in our Venn diagram, with constant and transparent re-evaluation of its effectiveness, we will be chasing our own tail in perpetuity.National PostDr. Zain Chagla and Dr. Dominik Mertz are associate professors in the division of infectious diseases at McMaster University.Jesse Kline: How conspiracists could prolong the pandemic - possibly indefinitely(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/jesse-kline-how-conspiracists-could-prolong-the-pandemic-possibly-indefinitely)Lauren Heuser: COVID has put a stop to so many things.
