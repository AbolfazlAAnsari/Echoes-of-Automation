            "inputText": "Hostility to the rule of law is in intellectual fashion. There is an abundant supply of polite opinion to the effect that, while it may be referenced in the preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the rule of law is nothing more than slogan for right-wingers, or worse. In democracies, with their messy political compromises and imperfect realization of anyone's preferred principles of justice, appeals to the authority of law are regarded as heartless at best, and oppressive at worst.We are seeing this rhetoric surrounding the protests against the enforcement of court orders allowing construction of the Coastal GasLink Pipeline despite the opposition of Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs who assert title to part of the land through which the pipeline would pass. Appeals to the rule of law are said to be no more than justifications for the deployment of government power, which is, moreover, argued to be illegitimate when applied to those who never consented to it governing them. Some reminders about the nature and purpose of the rule of law are therefore in order.The rule of law is opposed to lawlessness and the exercise of arbitrary or unlimited power. It requires government action to be justified by publicly available pre-existing rules. It also requires those rules to be impartially enforced, whether by the police, by administrative decision-makers or by the courts. Under the rule of law, citizens have the opportunity to challenge the authorities' decisions that affect them and argue that these decisions are contrary to law. In a constitutional democracy such as Canada, where the power of lawmakers is itself limited by the supreme law of the constitution, citizens can contest the constitutionality of the laws that would otherwise apply to them.But the rule of law also imposes restraints and responsibilities on individuals. It means that, people are expected to follow the law even if they think their rights are being violated. They are expected to address themselves to the relevant legal institutions, and to follow the procedures those institutions impose. What is more, when these institutions make decisions unfavourable to them, they must - once they have exhausted opportunities for complaint, review, or appeal - abide by their decision. Even civil disobedience traditionally involves acceptance of punishment for law-breaking.No doubt all this can be quite burdensome. Legal constraints and procedures slow us down when they do not altogether prevent us from doing as we wish. Bureaucrats, police officers and politicians can be impatient of restraints on their pursuit of efficiency, order and good policy. Individuals can resent what they perceive to be unjust decisions - the opportunity to be heard is not always a substitute for having one's claims recognized. And, of course, legal procedures are often too long and ruinously expensive. There is much room for improvement in the Canadian legal system.The closed train tracks are seen in Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, Ont. on Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2020, in support of Wet'suwet'en's blockade of a natural gas pipeline in northern B.C.Yet despite this, the rule of law is immensely valuable because it is the only way we have to contain the tendency of those wielding power, be it public or private, to act without regard to the rights and interests of ordinary people. The rule of law does not eliminate coercion or power imbalances, but it replaces one-sided domination with relationships that involve rights and obligations on both sides. The rule of law does not, by itself, guarantee justice, but without it just laws cannot be upheld and unjust ones peacefully reformed.Now, it is true that Canadian governments have often failed to keep even this limited promise of the rule of law in their relationships with Indigenous Canadians. Arbitrary exercise of power, the conviction that might makes right, the deliberate flouting of commitments made and rights recognized, the failure to provide for fair law enforcement and judicial process - there has been all this, and more. It is understandable that appeals to the rule of law are met with special skepticism in this context.Despite, and indeed in part because of, this history, the rule of law is no less important in the context of the relationship between the Canadian state and Indigenous people. Knowing the history of this relationship, does anyone seriously believe that if these matters are left to the whims of mob justice and power struggles, the interests and entitlements of the Indigenous people will prevail? The rule of law is most necessary precisely where power imbalances are strongest and injustice most entrenched.John Ivison: The millennial eco-activists stopping trains the new colonialists(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-ivison-the-millennial-eco-activists-stopping-trains-are-the-new-colonialists)NP View: If Trudeau has lost interest in his job, perhaps he should quit(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/np-view-if-trudeau-has-lost-interest-in-his-job-perhaps-he-should-quit)Derek H. Burney: Enough is enough. Clear the blockades, restore the rule of law(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/derek-h-burney-enough-is-enough-clear-the-blockades-restore-the-rule-of-law)Trudeau says he wants quick, peaceful resolution as rail blockades continue to wreak havoc(https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/federal-emergency-group-to-meet-on-pipeline-protests-as-rail-blockades-continue)But, even in such cases, the rule of law cannot be a one-way street. It requires the government to act within the bounds of constraints imposed on it, and to open its decisions to legal challenge, but it also requires those challenging government decisions to accept the outcomes of an impartial review process.In the case of the Wet'suwet'en, such a process has taken place. Madam Justice Church, of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, endeavoured to understand the Wet'suwet'en view of the hereditary chiefs' position in their dispute with the province, which has authorized the construction of the Coastal GasLink Pipeline. The hereditary chiefs have chosen not to engage in consultations or challenge the permits and authorizations granted. Instead, they resorted to \"self-help\" remedies such as blockades. Having examined the evidence produced by all the parties, Justice Church found that the hereditary chiefs' tactics not only defied Canadian law but were not based on Wet'suwet'en law either. Hence her order that the blockade cease.The decision can be appealed. And if there are allegations that the government failed in its duty to consult Indigenous peoples or has otherwise violated their rights - despite the evidence before the court that consultations occurred or were available, and the fact that many democratically-elected band leaders support the pipeline - those issues will ultimately come before the court for a fair determination.Some will say that Justice Church and other members of the judiciary are simply agents of an illegitimate, colonialist legal system. To put it bluntly, this is a challenge to the authority of the Canadian state. It is no answer to say that multiple legal systems, Indigenous and non-Indigenous alike, can coexist within the Canadian framework. They certainly can - just as Quebec's civil law coexists with the common law elsewhere - but to do so they require a single set of overarching rules determining which system applies to a given dispute.These background rules have to be common to all Canadians. And they cannot be established unilaterally by some, case by case. The attempt to do so here is no different, in substance, from the claims of self-proclaimed \"sovereign citizens\" who reject the authority of Canadian law because they never consented to it - at least when that law imposes obligations on them.What is possible and highly desirable, however, is for the perfectly legitimate aspirations of Indigenous Canadians to self-government to be recognized and given effect within the Canadian legal system. This can be done - and has already been done for some groups - by agreement with provincial and federal governments. We hope that more such agreements are reached. There is a lot to do, and fast. But these agreements, and Indigenous self-government - like all decent government - will require commitment to the rule of law on all sides, not its rejection as if it were an antiquated trope.
