Second-degree murder charges have been laid against the officer who pressed his knee on Floyd's neck, and the others have now been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. The debate that has ensued in Canada in the aftermath has been mixed, with some acknowledging that racism exists in Canada, and others outright denying it.The reality is that Canada, much like the United States, has a history of social injustice and economic inequality between different racial groups. This goes as far back as the first contact between Europeans and Indigenous peoples. Over the centuries, the economic and political imbalances between communities have been redefined with each new wave of immigration, as evidenced by the fact that we scrapped and denounced the head tax, only to impose another variant of it - a now normalized right of landing fee.Racism towards various minority groups exists in Canada still, and anti-black racism is a real problem and is certainly a cause of frustration, but we believe that there is hope.

This is particularly concerning for visible minority groups. The Ontario Anti-Racism Directorate's 2017 community consultations found that black-Canadians face major obstacles when looking for employment.
