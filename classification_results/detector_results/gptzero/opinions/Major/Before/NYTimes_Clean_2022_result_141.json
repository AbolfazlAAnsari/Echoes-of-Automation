Also: The Oklahoma abortion ban; stopping gun violence; remote work and the climate.To the Editor:Re “College Students Are Not OK,” by Jonathan Malesic (Opinion guest essay, Sunday Review, May 15):As a former attorney in the areas of education and disability rights, and a parent of a current college student, I was disappointed in Mr. Malesic’s analysis of the reasons so many kids are struggling academically right now. The essence of the article is that students are performing poorly and not attending classes because they have grown accustomed to online rather than in-person instruction.Although the shift to remote learning may have contributed to the difficulties some students are experiencing, Mr. Malesic’s explanation is too simplistic. Students are struggling because they are coming of age in a time of unprecedented societal turmoil: a global pandemic, a weakening democracy sliding toward authoritarianism, economic uncertainty, crushing debt and an endangered planet.Understandably, their age group is suffering from an epidemic of mental health challenges. Students not only feel burned out; they’re also wondering whether there is any point to anything anymore.Whether they are studying remotely or in person, until we devote the resources necessary to address the mental health crisis on college campuses, many students will continue to struggle academically.Jenifer KastenScottsdale, Ariz.To the Editor:Give Jonathan Malesic an A for observation and analysis of the “learning breakdown” on campus.Covid shutdowns two years ago relaxed standards from required attendance to optional video cameras. Students immediately sensed the lack of rigor and structure, and their already minuscule attention spans wandered quickly. Getting tuition payments and getting them through was the priority imposed by administrators.This spring students are failing classes they need to graduate. Writing and critical thinking skills are weak. Gone is their ability to work in groups that were virtually nonexistent in Covid semesters. Those most needing help floundered as class instruction and discussion withered on a Zoom screen. Online help was rarely taken.The cost of this learning breach is significant and long-lasting. Universities face a dilemma: Add student tutors and mentors, bolster student help centers and update mental health assistance — or relax standards permanently. The latter is not the answer. But either will be costly for students, family and society.Leonard M. ApcarBaton Rouge, La.The writer is professional-in-residence at the Manship School of Mass Communication, Louisiana State University, and a former editor at The New York Times.To the Editor:My mom informed me during a routine phone conversation that a recent graduate of a peer high school had died by suicide earlier that week, the fifth suicide in 2022 in our circles. “It feels like my generation has failed your generation,” she said.Between a raging pandemic, a worsening climate crisis, ceaseless war and seemingly constant mass shootings, my peers and I find ourselves increasingly hopeless about our ability to thrive in the world, to make a positive difference in its future.Needless to say, we cannot be our best selves in the classroom: We are burned out, angry, isolated, despairing. We are not OK.Adolescent mental health and the ways it is affected by current events must be a constant consideration for educational institutions. I believe that my peers and I are capable of learning, but we receive and process information differently than students from previous generations — or even from five years ago. We require standards that are not necessarily looser, but that are suited to the student experience in the pandemic and the digital age.Lindsay CarlinPalo Alto, Calif.The writer is a freshman at Stanford University.To the Editor:Jonathan Malesic’s essay makes for discouraging reading. And I am astounded by the difference between the disengagement that he describes and my experience from March 2020 to June 2021, when I taught undergraduates at a public university entirely through Zoom and other internet-based resources.My courses were primarily small, discussion-based courses, and right from the panicked start of the emergency shift online, my students seemed more energized than ever in class. They were living at home, joining class from their bedrooms, and clearly found the courses a relief from isolation.They were required to submit a written comment on the reading for each class several hours before we met, so that I could use their questions and insights to shape the discussion. The students had thought through the issues more carefully than had been the case before our transition to online.When I got used to the collaborative course site (whose potential I had previously neglected), the students began to reply to one another’s initial observations. The fact that on Zoom their names appeared onscreen allowed everyone to call each other by name, whereas in previous in-person classes they tended to say “I agree with her/him …” It was easy for them to share their work onscreen. And we could invite guest speakers from anywhere in the world.I am sorry to learn that many students have reacted differently to the changes in higher education over the past two years, and I realize more than ever how fortunate my students and I have been.John D. LyonsCharlottesville, Va.The writer is emeritus professor of French at the University of Virginia.The Oklahoma Abortion BanTo the Editor:Re “Oklahoma Passes a Measure to Ban Abortion at Fertilization” (front page, May 20):If it is fair for Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma to blame the “socialist Democrat left” for championing abortions of fetuses who would otherwise be born into poverty, then it is also fair to blame the “reactionary Republican Party” for championing the vast increase in the maternal mortality and child poverty rates that will follow the implementation of the abortion ban that Oklahoma has passed.Robert E. LehrerChicagoStop Gun Violence Before It StartsTo the Editor:Re “Number of Gun Deaths Reached Record Levels in 2020, C.D.C. Finds” (news article, May 11):As cities work to address rising rates of gun deaths, they must look beyond the traditional knee-jerk responses that call for more police officers and more incarceration. Over the last 60 years,data has shown that police budgets aren’t correlated with crime rates, and neither areincarceration rates.Prevention, not punishment, is the solution needed to stop gun violence before it even starts. One of the most promising prevention programs is community violence intervention. Such programs rely on “violence interrupters” — people from communities most affected by violence who are trained in intervention — to stop violence through de-escalation, mediation and relationship building.These approaches have been successful in neighborhoods fromOaklandtoChicagotoBrooklyn. For example, the implementation of theAdvance Peaceviolence interruption program in Richmond, Calif., was followed by an85 percent reduction in shootings with an injury.To stop senseless gun deaths, elected officials need to learn from and invest in successful programs like community violence intervention. To create public safety, we must invest in preventing violence from occurring in the first place.Nicholas TurnerBrooklynThe writer is the president and director of the Vera Institute of Justice.Work From Home, and Help the ClimateTo the Editor:Re “The Fuzzy Math of Three Days in the Office” (Sunday Business, May 22):I wish you would include the benefit of remote work on climate emissions. Keeping polluting, single-occupant vehicles off clogged highways can reduce carbon emissions.The current model of office space is expensive and wasteful. These buildings largely sit empty at night and on weekends but still light up the sky and require heating and cooling. The money spent on leasing space could be invested in the business. That office space could be converted to housing over time.The pandemic showed us that employees can be equally productive working from home. This is a rare opportunity to make a significant impact on climate change that people like!Yes, there are kinks that need to be worked out. Rather than yearning for a return to the office, we should be moving forward with a better, more sustainable model.Rebecca WardChevy Chase, Md.PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Derek Brahney FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
