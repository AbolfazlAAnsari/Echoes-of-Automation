But he paid a massive price in historical terms: the humiliation of resignation followed by years in an exile of public disgrace.It's unclear whether a Trump prosecution will occur, but official disgrace may still await him in some form; though his cult-like acolytes in the public and conservative media will never accept it, no matter what the evidence. And that's what makes this moment in history even more troubling.During the Watergate investigation, the fundamentals of American democracy had not been shaken to their foundations yet; they held strong because the public seemed to grasp the ultimate gravity of being led by a lawless president.NBC'sDavid Brinkleyput it this way in 1973:\"Our history shows the American people will put up with a great deal, even when the demands on them are outrageous, as they often are. But they will not put up with anyone who claims to be, or tries to be, above the law, immune to the rules applying to everybody else. It seems to be known instinctively that if anyone acquires that privilege, it will be the end of this country.\"Fifty years ago, I was sure Brinkley was right. I'm not confident of that now after watching the most recent Jan. 6 hearings. I expect he wouldn't be either.Opinion by Bill Carter for CNN Business PerspectivesTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
