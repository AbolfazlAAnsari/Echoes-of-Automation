University presses are already declining to publish books with poor markets, no matter how worthy the scholarship, because they can no longer afford to do so. And so faculty members without a book contract in academic departments for which the book is key will not receive tenure.The impact of the marketplace is real and will affect the tenure process for years to come.George F. ThompsonStaunton, Va.The writer is a book publisher.To the Editor:Molly Worthen’s guest essay introduces some fair observations on how to modernize universities’ approach to tenure, but misses a few simple structural changes that institutions can make to help improve the classroom experience for everyone.At Barnard College, where I am president, our professors have tenure at both Barnard, which is focused on in-classroom experiences, and Columbia University, with the resources of a large Ivy League research-focused institution. This creates a balanced expectation for Barnard faculty members to pursue their own research while ensuring that they also serve and involve the students they teach.More broadly, honors programs at many colleges and universities tend to prioritize close mentorship relationships between undergraduates and faculty. There is room to expand this approach where professors invest personally in their students’ success.Higher education can and should reflect on the tenure process. However, structural changes that more closely align the experience for students and our cherished faculty will be what allows us to truly live the life of the mind.Sian Leah BeilockNew York‘Disheartened’ by the C.D.C. Director’s Decision on BoostersTo the Editor:Re “States Rush to Roll Out Booster Shot Programs for Eligible Americans” (front page, Sept. 25):As a former chair of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, I am disheartened by the C.D.C. director’s reversal, within hours, of the committee’s recommendation that those with occupational exposure to Covid-19 should not receive boosters at this time.Not only is the director’s decision wrong on the merits and unsupported by the science, as made clear by the careful review of data and deliberations of the committee, but it undermines the longstanding independent, transparent, and highly ethical and valuable process of making vaccination policy in the United States.Finally, the director’s decision to include health care workers, teachers and other frontline workers among those eligible for the booster will make implementation of booster doses far more complicated, risking the successful delivery of the boosters to those in the recommended categories — over 65, in long-term care facilities and with underlying medical conditions — who have real need of them.Nancy M.

And, yes, the optics certainly superficially invite comparison of the president and his predecessor. But Mr. Biden and Donald Trump in the same sentence? I think not.Mr. Trump’s animosities, coupled with his incompetence, invited disaster at every turn. Mr. Biden’s morality and lifelong belief in the foundation of government at least give us reason to hope for a better tomorrow.And there is poetry in not having Mr. Trump there to remind us how easy it is to squander the riches of a democracy.Robert S. NussbaumGreat Barrington, Mass.A $3.5 Trillion BargainTo the Editor:Re “It’s Not Really a $3.5 Trillion Bill,” by Peter Coy (Opinion, nytimes.com, Sept. 22):Americans have trouble passing anything because they only see big numbers, not the per capita cost divided among 330 million people over 10 years. This hugely beneficial bill averages $3 a day, or the cost of a cup of coffee or a McDonald’s Happy Meal. And that is an average. The rich pay more and the middle class and poor pay less. For millions, this money would be their salary in a job with a future.And what do we get? Roads, bridges that don’t fall down, electric car charging stations, the cleanest air in generations, universal preschool, expanded child care benefits, and for those who care, a habitable world for their grandchildren.Seems like a bargain to me.Deborah MoranHoustonPHOTO:    (PHOTOGRAPH BY Illustration by Shoshana Schultz; photographs by Allen Green/Getty Images and Ollie Noonan Jr./The Boston Globe, via Getty Images FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
