Please send your letters toletters@independent.co.ukLeaders from across the globe are preparing for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting that starts inRwandatoday –World Refugee Day.  Yet, in a contradiction to the vision of “a Commonwealth that is mutually respectful, resilient, peaceful and prosperous and that cherishes equality, diversity and shared values”, the UK government persists with its plan to send asylum seekers and refugees on a one-way flight to the same African state.This disturbing new scheme sends those seeking safety in the UK to Rwandain exchange for cash, and targets people simply because of how they arrived here, irrespective of their need for protection. Britain is not onlyflouting international law, but it is failing to protect its share of people fleeing other countries from around the world.Rather than this outdated and offensive stance, Britain must step up as a leader, take responsibility and end this shameful scheme. We must instead open safe routes for asylum seekers and refugees to find protection in the UK and build a fair and orderly system.Amanda Church-Mcfarlane, Co-CEO of Abigail HousingWaad al-Kateab, Co-founder of Action For SamaDuncan McAuley, CEO of Action FoundationLiz Windsor-Welsh, CEO of Action Together CIOFahim Zazai, Manager of Afghan Community and Welfare CentreChizobam Obumneme Ekenna, General manager of African Community CentreAderonke Apata, Founder and CEO of African Rainbow FamilyImogen McIntosh, Director of Aid Box CommunityGraeme Hodge, CEO of All We CanFrances Walker, Head of English at Archway Learning TrustSalma Zulfiqar, Founder and director of ARTconnectsEwan James Roberts, Centre manager of Asylum Link MerseysideDoreen Hengari, Director at Asylum Seekers And Refugee Support SanctuaryMark Goldring, Director at Asylum WelcomeSarah Magill, Director and trustee of Azadi CharityRevd.

Shapps is being territorial. He probably sees punishing “millions of innocent people” as the exclusive job of the Tory government.Actually, the RMT is doing what job unions were founded to do – protecting the terms and conditions of their members. They are taking industrial action to ensure the wages of their members keep pace with 11 per cent inflation.All workers should support them and follow their example.Sasha SimicLondonVote of no confidenceI refer toLiam James’ informative articlein yesterday’s edition. It is reported that the pamphlets distributed by Tory by-election candidates Helen Hurford and Nadeem Ahmed in support of their candidacy omit reference to their prime minister,Boris Johnson.This might fairly be construed as a clear vote of no confidence by prospective MPs riding into action in two important by-elections on a Tory ticket. They appear not only to have no confidence in Johnson but, by implication at least, very little in the party they purport to represent.As things stand their successful election seems unlikely. If elected, it would appear that presently disaffected Tory MPs should feel able to rely on their support in any future vote of no confidence in their prime minister.David NelmesNewportThe PM in hidingWouldn’t it be just great to know where Boris Johnson plans to hide out on Friday after the almost certainly disastrous by-elections on Thursday?He certainly cannot go back to Ukraine already; the Queen is hardly likely to let him use Sandringham or Windsor; Dublin and the rest of the EU are not realistic options either!Rwanda glad-handing anyone?Robert BostonKingshillTory incompetenceI wholeheartedly agree withthe sentiments expressed in your letter page yesterdayregarding the endless self-serving stunts of the PM and his sycophants.What worries me more is their incompetence. On Saturday, my seven-year-old grandson became unwell. His mother treated his temperature, but at about 4pm he said his chest hurt and his little heart was racing. She called 999, but was advised to take him to hospital. They were booked in, eventually triaged and sent home after two hours. The consultant did not want to see him. He still had a temperature and said his chest hurt.Then the hospital rang to say the out-of-hours GP wanted to see him. Another wait for a phone call – the appointment was for 9.15pm.To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter byclicking hereLuckily for us, he was declared fine. He is asthmatic so any respiratory illness is a worry. All this could have been resolved at the earlier visit. This story has a happy outcome – not all calls to 999 end this way.I am 68 – I remember Thatcher’s Britain, raised my daughter on benefits in the Eighties when being a single mother (albeit a professional, divorced woman) was a dirty word. I remember the poverty, the lack of hope, the despair. Now a WASPI pensioner, I feel the same dread asprices riseand frustration mounts. This government has no ideas, no empathy, and no morals.Name withheldCheltenham"
