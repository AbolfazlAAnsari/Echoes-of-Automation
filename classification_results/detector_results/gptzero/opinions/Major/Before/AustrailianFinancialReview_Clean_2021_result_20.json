            "inputText": "Economy Labour shortages, supply chain blockages and the energy crunch are creating conditions ripe for an inflationary spiral and a return to higher interest rates.A few years ago the then Treasury secretary and I were discussing Malcolm Turnbull's plan to increase the GST to 15 per cent and cut income taxes. He told me the Treasury economic model showed that such a controversial change to the tax system would have a negligible effect on the nation's GDP.You can understand why Turnbull dropped the plan. The Treasury model would have been devastating evidence in the court of public opinion.I thought the model's conclusions we're counter-intuitive, and so did the secretary. He argued that ultimately economic judgments need a heavy dose of intuition, not just cold, passion-less models.Which brings me to the here and now. The models, the central banks, the treasuries of Western countries and the IMF are all telling us the global economy is recovering from the COVID-19 recession, and politicians tell us they're going to \"build back better\". I hope they're right, and the markets suggest analysts agree with them. My intuition tells me otherwise.I'm pessimistic about the global economy, and can't help but worry we are on the cusp of a major economic realignment with significant social and political consequences.Here's why. There's an ugly confluence of COVID-19 recovery policies and climate change initiatives, and the two are not going to work well together.Let's start with COVID-19 policies. Through the crisis, governments have massively increased expenditure, deficits and debt. Inflation has been almostnon-existent, interest rates have sunk to record lows, and debt servicing costs have been surprisingly modest.What is more, central banks have pursued quantitative easing policies - that is, in common parlance, printed money. That all sounds good. Money for nothing.Furthermore, large numbers of people have worked from home and quite enjoyed the experience. Others have decided to leave the workforce altogether.So we have two things happening at once. The massive increase in money in the global economy is stimulating economic activity at a time when there is a decline in the labour participation rate. That is inevitably going to push up the price of labour. That's now happening in almost every developed economy. Businesses are struggling to find labour to do everything from driving trucks to working in the hospitality sector.Politicians can see an upside to this. They can claim that under their watch wages are increasing and unemployment is low. But businesses will have to recoup the cost of rising wages, and that will be inflationary.Added to that is the stimulatory effect of huge increases in public sector spending. That's fine during a recession, but now, as economies recover, supply constraints are forcing up prices of everything from energy to shipping. That too is inflationary.The evidence is already there. For a couple of decades, the inflation rate in developed economies has run at about 2 per cent. Inflation in the US last month was more than 5 per cent and in Britain is running at above 4 per cent. Price rises are becoming a political issue.This is all because we have forgotten something. If you increase the money supply too rapidly beyond the rate of economic growth and improvements in productivity, the consequence will be inflation. We learnt those lessons through the 1970s and the '80s. Those lessons have all been forgotten now and will very painfully have to be relearned.Then there's climate change. It's only a week or so until the good and the great assemble at COP26 in Glasgow, and government leaders will proclaim their support for net zero by 2050 - not that any of them will be around by 2050. We all look forward to the moving speeches about the importance of wind and solar power, and boasts about how economies are moving away from hydrocarbons.On the face of it, this process had a bit of help through the COVID-19 crisis. Demand for energy declined by 5 per cent last year. But now the recovery is under way, we are reminded that 83 per cent of global energy is still generated by fossil fuels.The problem is obvious. All that pump-priming of the global economy has led to a strong recovery, which means a significant increase in demand for energy. But investment in fossil fuels has fallen by 40 per cent since 2015. It is just not possible to increase the supply of windmills and solar panels fast enough to offset the declining fossil fuel capacity. The result is extraordinary increases in energy prices.What is more, there is always going to be a problem with providing baseload power from renewables, but for political reasons governments in recent decades have refused to build nuclear power plants. If they had done that, then there would've been plenty of baseload power and no emissions coming from it. Still, that's history. The present is the worry. Expect energy prices to increase even more as the northern hemisphere enters winter.The huge increase in energy prices is, of course, also inflationary - on top of the inflationary pressures described above. With inflation come rising interest rates. That's barely started but expect interest rates to increase over the course of next year.Higher interest rates will impose substantially higher debt servicing costs on governments and on highly leveraged businesses and individuals. Of course, higher interest rates can be contained by central banks by firing up the printing presses. But that will be inflationary. That's probably not an option any more.So there you have it. The conditions are ripe for a return to higher rates of inflation than we have seen for past two decades. That will in turn lead to a demand for wage increases to maintain standards of living. And that too will be inflationary.We run the very real risk of returning to an inflationary spiral with relatively high interest rates. If that happens, governments won't have many levers left to pull. They might even have to give some thought to trying to re-encourage an entrepreneurial and productivity-enhancing culture.For the time being they have returned to a 1950s-style preoccupation with public sector spending and controls over the economy. It didn't work then, and it won't work now.Alexander Downer was Australia's longest serving foreign minister, from 1996 to 2007, and most recently Australian high commissioner to the UK."
