            "inputText": "In mid-March, for the first time in history, Canada went into lockdown as part of a desperate effort to control a novel pathogen. It is now late November and we are deep into the second wave. Long-term care facilities, though better protected since the first wave, are once again dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths. Admissions to hospitals, including intensive-care units, are piling on the back of a chronically overloaded health-care system. But despite this scenario being reminiscent of March, the current situation has some important differences, and much of that is due to our greater knowledge of the virus itself.In March, the threat was new and largely unknown. We all saw the fearsome images from Wuhan, China, Bergamo, Italy, and New York City. We pulled together, united and denied the virus much of its fuel - we closed everything but the essentials, in order to protect ourselves and our health-care system from being overwhelmed. And while the health-care system was not stretched beyond capacity, marginalized communities were disproportionately impacted by these restrictions.Now, polarization is creeping into some of our national and provincial conversations, as public health measures are increasingly perceived on a spectrum ranging from \"unfortunately necessary\" to \"useless and damaging.\" As the pandemic drags on, the incentive to adhere to life-disrupting public health guidance may seem less and less relevant, especially to individuals who believe the risk they face is minimal. Further complicating matters is the fact that core components of our pandemic response require attention, including boosting our test-and-trace systems and offering better supports for those who are disproportionately impacted by both the virus and the policies designed to curb it.Emerging vaccine data provides a glimpse into a much brighter future, with roll-out expected to begin in the first quarter of 2021. But we first need to safely navigate the challenging winter months ahead. No radical paradigm shifts are necessary; we just need to focus on the fundamental tenets of our epidemic response and integrate the lessons that have been learned in Canada and abroad. This involves strengthening policies that will drive case numbers down, doing everything possible to maintain lower levels of community transmission, better protecting vulnerable populations and preventing our health-care system from being overwhelmed.There are four key principles that we need to focus on during the months ahead.First, we need measures to reduce nonessential indoor interactions, as well as protect schools and essential workplaces. This is a job not just for public health officials, but for individuals, as well. We need to limit our overall indoor interactions with non-household members during high transmission periods, which will help lower community transmission. For our essential interactions, we should prioritize indoor masking, distancing, ventilation and hand-washing. We also need to do a better job of protecting essential workplaces, hospitals and schools.Second, we need to support essential workers and marginalized communities. Many essential workers cannot work from home. They are involved in food services, caring professions, transport and infrastructure work - all jobs that directly support Canadian society. These individuals require safe workplaces, with universal indoor masking, physical distancing, ventilation and safe places to take breaks. Essential workers should have easy access to paid sick leave, which minimizes financial instability when symptomatic or exposed, and subsequently reduces workplace transmission. Access to facilities where people with large households can safely isolate should also be readily available. Supporting worker safely will reduce transmission and reduce pandemic-related disruptions to workplaces.Third, we must strengthen our testing, tracing, isolation and support systems. Every symptomatic person should be able to easily access testing, and receive timely results and guidance. Public health units require infrastructure and personnel to bolster their contact-tracing systems, which will help protect at-risk individuals, reduce community transmission and better inform our public health response. The appropriate use of rapid tests should be prioritized in high-risk areas, such as long-term care homes and remote communities. These rapid tests may not rule out all infection, but positive tests could help identify contagious individuals who should then isolate.Finally, governments must recognize the importance of community engagement and communication. Meaningfully engaging communities and providing information that is age, language and culturally appropriate, through conventional and social media platforms, will help communities understand and adapt to policy measures, drive positive behavioural change and help keep our communities safe.None of the aforementioned measures are new, and all of them have been implemented across Canada to varying degrees. Sticking with this blueprint, and improving how we implement it, will guide us safely into the vaccine era. The initial batch of vaccines is expected to reduce overall deaths and decrease health-care utilization, even if a relatively small initial supply is prioritized for those who face the greatest risk of severe infection. As vaccination campaigns expand, population vaccine-induced immunity will be the major milestone on our march back to normalcy.In the meantime, we need to double down on our public health efforts, and increase the consistency of our federal, provincial, municipal and individual responses, in order to lower rates of transmission and keep them low. There is no magic to this process, just continued adherence to the core principles of public health and epidemic management, providing support for impacted groups, engaging communities and communicating effectively.National PostZain Chagla is an infectious diseases specialist at McMaster University.
