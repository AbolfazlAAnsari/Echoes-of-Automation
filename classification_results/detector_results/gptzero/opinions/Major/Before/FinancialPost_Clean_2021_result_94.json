The state of our economy and the sustainability of public finances are presenting major challenges. Both provincially and federally, deficits are large and will remain so for the foreseeable future. In addition, Canadians' tax capacity will be limited for some time while demands on government from an aging population are set to increase.At the moment, many governments are considering major public transit projects. Ottawa recently announced investments of close to $15 billion for municipal public transit, while several provinces that have not already done so seem likely to make similar announcements in coming months.These investments will help ensure the safe, efficient, and affordable mobility of our population. But in the post-COVID fiscal situation, capital funding for these major projects should minimize the demand on taxpayers. Instead, governments should seek greater private-sector financing. In addition to reducing dependency on public funds, private finance would bring the further benefit of aligning incentives more effectively and reducing conceptual and execution risks that typically lead to cost overruns and delayed timelines on public projects.As a concept, public-private partnerships (P3s) have been around for over 25 years. But when it comes to public transit projects there have been few P3s, and those in place have had minimal recourse to private financing. In fact, private financing requirements have been so low that projects have rarely had to access international financial markets. That is not likely to be the case post-COVID.In addition to reducing the taxpayer burden, P3s greatly increase the likelihood of on-time, on-budget delivery of a high-quality end product.The reason for this more predictable, positive outcome is simple: increased scrutiny and due diligence by the project company investors and its lenders. They will supervise execution and quality control to ensure they meet their expected long-term financial returns. As for the government, it obtains predictability in its financial obligations, validation of the project concept and greatly reduced risk. Perhaps most importantly, P3s reduce the burden on taxpayers. It's win-win-win.Terence Corcoran: From beer to billionaires, massive tax grabs are here(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-from-beer-to-billionaires-massive-tax-grabs-are-here)Opinion: Give Ontario construction workers the vote(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-give-ontario-construction-workers-the-vote)Jack M. Mintz: How the Biden tax and infrastructure plan could boost Canada(https://financialpost.com/opinion/jack-m-mintz-how-the-biden-tax-and-infrastructure-plan-could-boost-canada)Let's take an example. Imagine a $10-billion project to design, build, finance, operate and maintain a public transit service operating on dedicated infrastructure.There is, of course, a construction component to put the infrastructure in place, right up to the point of commissioning. But there is also the manufacturing of rolling stock and train operating systems, such as signalling, electrification and communication, and their installation. Finally, there's the building and tooling of maintenance facilities. These components that come after construction of the infrastructure can often represent more than half the total costs of a project - in this example, $5 billion of the $10 billion total cost of the project. But both this component and the construction can easily be financed by the private sector, rather than Canadian taxpayers. This frees up money the government can reallocate elsewhere, for example, to lower taxes or invest in health, education, or other programs.Unlike the construction component, which takes place at the front end of the project, operation and maintenance of the infrastructure, rolling stock and systems continue for the full term of the project. The private sector can finance these assets and then, over their lifecycle, the government can pay back the private-sector operator through \"availability payments.\" This means the private operator only receives payment from the government or transit agency when assets (trains, tracks, systems, stations, etc.) are available and services are being delivered by the operator, on schedule. The government or transit agency continues to set and collect fares independently and only pays for services that are delivered according to the agreed operating goals.In the past, some have argued that governments didn't need private participation because they had access to cheaper capital than private firms did. But in today's low-interest environment, the gap between private and public borrowing costs has narrowed considerably. Moreover, the significant operating benefits and the availability payment method outweigh the somewhat higher capital costs the private sector faces.As governments plan the recovery of our economy, modernizing Canada's public transit infrastructure presents a unique opportunity to reduce their dependency on taxpayers' money. Taxpayers, for their part, should demand that private-sector players finance the projects they seek to build, operate and maintain for the long term.Yves Desjardins-Siciliano is CEO of Siemens Mobility Canada. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
