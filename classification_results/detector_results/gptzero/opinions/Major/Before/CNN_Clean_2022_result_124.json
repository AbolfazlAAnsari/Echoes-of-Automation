While the war effort is financed above all in rubles, such a fall in export revenues would devastate Russia's foreign exchange earnings. Russia may find itself unable to fulfill its foreign currency obligations, causing it to default on international loans, further isolating Moscow in the global financial system. Russia pays its 20,000 foreign soldiers in foreign currency and, of course, many of its imports, too.Thus the impact of an EU oil embargo would be powerful. Russia cannot easily divert those supplies intended for Europe tocustomers in places elsewhere, like China. While there are other means to transport oil, they are considerably more expensive.Certainly, going cold turkey would reverberate negatively on the European populace and economy, sending oil prices even higher. If countries like Slovakia and Hungary cooperate, their European allies will certainly come to their aid, as they are to Poland and Bulgaria. The European economy would survive while Russia's - and hopefully the Putin war machine with it - would be crippled. This, surely, is worth the interim hardship.Opinion by Paul Hockenos for CNN Business PerspectivesTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
