In 2018, theSECalleged that Musk made \"false and misleading\" claims about taking Tesla private. Among other things, Musk agreed in asettlementwith the SEC to pay a $20 million fine and step down as Tesla's chairman for three years. But the settlement does not seem to have deterred Musk from flouting the rules again.Earlier this year, Musk waited 21 days to publicly disclose he had acquired 9.2% of Twitter shares when, under the SEC's rules, investors are typically required to make such disclosures within 10 days of purchasing 5% or more of a public company'sstock. Such a disclosure would have alerted Twitter's other shareholders that a large block of stock was being accumulated, likely sending the stock price higher. So the delay saved Musk the tens of millions of additional dollars he would have paid to buy the added shares he acquired had he made an earlier announcement.Policing Musk places the SEC in a tough position. Any financial penalties it's able to impose are likely to have little effect on someone as wealthy as Musk. And, in light of his importance to Tesla, other penalties could potentially harm shareholders, employees and others who have little or no say on whether or how Musk chooses to comply with the securities laws.Indeed, Musk's shadow extends well beyond his companies and products.
