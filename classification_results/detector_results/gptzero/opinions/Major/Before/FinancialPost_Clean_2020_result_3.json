Our concerns are pragmatic, moral and urgent.More than a year and a ha lf ago, a motion to list the IRGC was put forward by MP Garnett Genuis in the House of Commons and it passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. At the time, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale confirmed that the process to outlaw the IRGC would proceed. Much to our frustration, this terrorist organization has still not been designated as such. This became even more important following the recent horrific downing of Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752 by the IRGC, which killed everyone on board, including 57 Canadians. The Canadian government has provided no explanation for its failure to follow through with listing the IRGC as a terrorist organization, which is contrary to the clearly expressed will of Parliament.The principal objective of the IRGC - which is tasked with protecting Iran's brutal Islamist dictatorship and supporting its terror proxies such as Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Taliban - is to fuel and fund terrorism.
