A government should not be studying their collective political navels, but thinking and acting strategically for the good of the nation.Arthur Streatfield​                                          BathIronic tweetPriti Patel has tweeted, seemingly with some pride, \"We're ending free movement to open Britain up to the world. It will ensure people can come to our country based on what they have to offer, not where they come from.\"Ironically, the current cabinet seems to be filled with people whose selection was based purely upon where they come from (the pool of Tory sycophants willing to sell their souls to advance their careers) and not what their skills are (darn few to speak of).Of course, if the home secretary's intent was to highlight how much weaker the UK will be on its own then she's doing a stand-up job - our \"independence\" from Europe (in terms of science and the sourcing of personal protective equipment) currently seems to be costing the lives of thousands of our citizens. Indeed, as the prime minister himself pointed out, immigrant workers in our NHS (many of whom would struggle to meet the immigration criteria set by our government) have been doing their level best to reduce free movement between this world and the next. The tragedy is that, once the current crisis is over, they'll no doubt revert from being seen as key workers to being immigrant scum.Julian Self                                          Milton KeynesSide effectsDonald Trump's taking of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine is cause for concern. Among its possible side effects - which may explain a lot - are confusion, irritability, mood changes and unusual thoughts or behaviour. Also, more worrying for him, it can turn skin pale and increase hair loss.Roger Hinds                                          SurreyIt's inter-personalWorking from home may be the future and may even be the present for many, but having experienced it first-hand, personally I have yet to be convinced it comes close to being in the workplace, in terms of efficiency and morale. Working as a team in an office involves so much more than just sitting at a screen all day. For many, the instant responses to the myriad questions are an essential part of what makes a business function, not to mention the need to relate to others on a personal level.In years to come a system may exist that can more accurately mimic the work environment but it is nowhere near here yet. Still, the good news is the government could set an example and make parliament virtual. If business is expected to work remotely, what's to stop the running of the country on the same basis? We could save millions on MPs' travel and second homes, not to mention the huge cost of refurbishment of parliament buildingsG Forward                                          Stirling"
