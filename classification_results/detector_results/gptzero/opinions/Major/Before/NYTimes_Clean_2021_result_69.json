What was wrong with “gay”?Wayne A. CorneliusPortland, Ore.The writer is professor emeritus of political science at University of California San Diego.Money for a Central Park Concert?To the Editor:Re “Turning the Page With a Central Park Concert” (Arts pages, June 8):“I can’t think of a better place than the Great Lawn of Central Park to be the place where you say that New York is reopening,” says the impresario of the planned concert.I can think of a great many places: the cultural institutions that are still on life support as the pandemic wanes. The public funds allocated for this extravaganza would provide longer-lasting benefits if they were distributed among the city’s many performing arts groups, museums and architectural treasures.Thomas FedorekNew YorkIt’s Hard to Get Mental Health CareTo the Editor:Re “Signs That It’s Time for Therapy” (Here to Help, May 23):I don’t know whether to laugh or cry when I read news articles, opinion pieces and letters to the editor about how important it is for people to recognize the symptoms of mental illness and get treatment for it.The reason for my reaction is that many people writing these pieces have absolutely no idea how difficult it is for some people to actually get treatment for mental illness.In my experience in Iowa, many mental health care providers will not accept Medicare, and if they do accept Medicare, they won’t accept Medicaid.This reality needs to be reported in depth.Gary SandersIowa CityPHOTO:    (PHOTOGRAPH BY Albert Tercero FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
