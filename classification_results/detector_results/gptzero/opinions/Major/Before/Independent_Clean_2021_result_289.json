Yet despite calling for the release of prominent human-rights defenders imprisoned by hostile states, the UK government has made no substantive statement, insteadrepeatingfalse assurances from Bahrain about his case.This silence risks emboldening Bahrain in their criminalisation of peaceful dissent and torture of dissidents. The UK government must condemnBahrain's persecution of AlSingace, call for the return of his intellectual property and immediate and unconditional release. This miscarriage of justice must end.Sir Peter Bottomley MPConservative Father of the House of Commons, Worthing WestSir Ed Davey MPLeader of the Liberal Democrats, Kingston and SurbitonIan Blackford MPWestminster leader of the Scottish National Party, Ross, Skye and LochaberFor a full list of signatures,click here.Panic attacksI've been wondering over the weekend whether the people causing unnecessary queues at petrol stations have their car boots full of toilet rolls that they purchased during their last panic attack?Michael PatePrestonHeadline grabbing turn-offThe letter from Graham Barlowillustrates the depths to which our politicians stoop when attempting to catch headlines.Angela Rayner will not care one iota that voters, of all colours, will be offended at such boorish, infantile and unnecessary foul mouth rhetoric. Ms Rayner, like Mr Johnson, needs to employ a better scriptwriter as this offensive language only serves to undermine the message from the Labour Party.It will serve the Conservative Party better than Labour in the long run. To think that Ms Rayner might one day be explaining the British point of view to, say, Mr Biden is unthinkable.Ms Rayner no doubt is passionate about the Labour Party's message and is trying to boost her chances of catching voters' attention. She probably has caught voters' eyes, but for all the wrong reasons.It is a fallacy to believe that headline-grabbing is either necessary or will be rewarded with rhetoric of the type Ms Rayner espoused. Call me old-fashioned, but I still believe the electorate is able to identify a party to vote for if manifestos and intent are clearly and honestly laid out.The disrespectful language serves to illustrate Ms Rayner's lack of restraint and inexperience in public office, or any office for that matter, and she now ought to grow up and apologise for such unnecessary language.Keith PooleBasingstoke"
