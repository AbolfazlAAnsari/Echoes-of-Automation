The question is not so much how EI should respond to a once-in-a-century event - expecting a flawless response was always too high a bar - but rather how it can be reformed to respond to a rapidly evolving labour market after the pandemic is over.One good policy recommendation is anything but novel. In 1986, Claude Forget wrote in the federal report that bore his name that unemployment insurance, as it was then called, was \"the only income security program where the rights of Canadians depend on where they live. This is bad social policy.\" He was referring to the lop-sided allocation of benefits to certain regions of Canada.In essence, EI is a two-tiered system joined awkwardly at the hip. The first tier typically affords adequate coverage to most unemployed workers in most situations, while the second is designed for seasonal and other part-year workers. This second tier has received disproportionate attention from EI policy-makers down to today, with the federal government setting up four separate pilot programs since 2004 aiming to enrich benefits for them.Permanent preoccupation with the needs of this select subset of unemployed workers will make it harder to meet the needs of other types of unemployed workers as the labour market recovers from the pandemic. EI's flexibility in targeting and delivering benefits to a broader array of unemployed workers could be greatly enhanced by creating a separate regime for part-year workers that would be explicitly and transparently funded without the cross-subsidies that mar today's system. That reform would better position us to design a third tier to provide at least some coverage for workers with non-standard employment.When EI was developed in the 1960s, it was designed to accommodate full-time, full-year workers holding one job. As late as 1976 they constituted 76 per cent of the labour force. In the early 1970s, however, greater coverage and benefits were given to full-time, part-year workers - though not to the part-time, full-year workers who are more common today. Reforms by the ChrÃ©tien government in 1994 and 1996 scaled back the generosity of EI benefits for part-year workers. In 2000, however, after a very public campaign promise from Jean ChrÃ©tien, the \"intensity rule\" that had slightly penalized repeat users and was very unpopular in Atlantic Canada, was repealed. Most of the pilot projects since then have targeted seasonal workers, while paying less attention to workers unemployed for other reasons.Allan Lanthier: It's time to fix the wage subsidy(https://financialpost.com/opinion/allan-lanthier-its-time-to-fix-the-wage-subsidy)Ted Mallett: EI reform is easier said than done(https://financialpost.com/opinion/ted-mallett-ei-reform-is-easier-said-than-done)Opinion: Guaranteed income would be a costly proposition(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-guaranteed-income-would-be-a-costly-proposition)Gwyn Morgan: Minister Freeland, private investment drives the economy(https://financialpost.com/opinion/gwyn-morgan-minister-freeland-private-investment-drives-the-economy)EI's administrative apparatus, labelled the \"entitlement matrix,\" is based on a formula that stipulates qualification conditions and weeks of entitlement for 62 regions across Canada as a function of the local unemployment rate. The higher the rate, the shorter the qualification period and the longer the entitlement period. Although its supporters have long claimed the matrix is adaptable enough to cover most insurable unemployment risks adequately, it has proven to be a ramshackle, ossified delivery mechanism that cannot adjust to the diverse needs of Canada's unemployed workers.The current program probably does provide adequate coverage for a majority of job losers, those who are laid off during shallow recessions, periods of slow economic growth, or from normal churning associated with firms going out of business, as they do in significant numbers even in good economic times. On average only about 33 per cent of claims are exhausted, and typically about 63 per cent of the entitlement is collected. During the deep recession of 2008-2009, benefits were extended by five weeks across-the-board and the exhaustion rate stayed at close to a third of all claims. Nor are there major gaps in coverage for frictionally unemployed workers, usually defined as those between jobs, who typically face short spells without work.For other unemployed workers, however, coverage may be inadequate - people who are permanently laid off and face high adjustment costs, for instance. They typically are eligible for active labour-market programs, such as job training benefits, but they often face long jobless periods and major pay reductions upon re-employment. Other workers who face involuntary part-time unemployment - i.e., they work fewer hours than they would like - are not eligible for assistance. A final category is \"gig workers,\" many of whom have been hit hard by the pandemic. Workers with non-standard forms of employment like this typically do not contribute to EI and are therefore uncovered.We should dispense with the misconception that the \"entitlement matrix\" can be fine-tuned through judicious regulatory changes and instead embrace substantive structural change that creates at least two separate regimes targeting unemployed workers in starkly different predicaments. For the majority who still hold \"standard\" jobs the matrix can remain but be greatly streamlined. For \"gig\" and similar workers we need a separate regime, but one that takes work incentives - and disincentives - seriously.David Gray teaches economics at the University of Ottawa.
