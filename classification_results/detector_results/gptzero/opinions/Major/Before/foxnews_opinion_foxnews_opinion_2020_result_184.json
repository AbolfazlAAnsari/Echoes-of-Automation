The more inaccurate answers pollsters get, the more inaccurate their polls turn out to be.Pollsters expect some people to falsely answer questions. But it seems the pollsters underestimated the number of such answers they got about this election. In the future, the pollsters need to take a step back and make sure that a major assumption of their models — that a large majority of people are comfortable telling them the truth — is right.Many of us have heard stories about the “shy” Trump voters reluctant to reveal their support for the president, but I think “shy” is a misnomer. “Scared” is a better word to describe these secret Trump voters.Unbelievably, people who have said they support the reelection of the president of the United States have been viciously attacked and called every negative name in the book on social media and elsewhere.Acknowledged Trump voters have been demonized and labeled as monsters, racists, homophobes, haters of women, opponents of science, opponents of democracy, and on and on.Trump voters know they are not “a basketful of Deplorables” as Hillary Clinton labeled them four years ago, no doubt to her later regret. They don’t want to be attacked simply for voting for the man they believe is the best candidate for president.And the downsides of admitting to being a Trump supporter are not simply sneers on the street or arguments with friends. Saying you support President Trump has had serious real-life consequences for some people — resulting in lost business opportunities, lower incomes, threatening the loss of jobs, and more. This is serious, utterly personal and terrifying for our democracy.Until pollsters and the mainstream media fully understand this, and are able to account for it, the polls will continue to be off the mark.Pollsters have recently lost touch with an intimidated American public. They can regain that touch once they understand this fear. Then we will be able to trust them again. LIBERTY VITTERT   "
