The Secretary’s response? \"I do not know.\"The person responsible for ensuring the security of our homeland against all enemies, foreign and domestic, does not know if his policies allowed apprehended potential terrorists full access to the United States. Let’s not forget why we have a border in the first place. Aside from it being the favored mode of entry for terrorists, the wide-open border has proven to be a boon for drug cartels and human traffickers.These cartels are trafficking massive amounts of fentanyl to the United States, killing 79,000 people between 2020-2021. It is now the number one killer for American aged 18-45. Only two milligrams can be lethal, but 839 pounds of fentanyl was seized at the southern border in January 2022 alone. But again, we have no way of knowing how much higher the real number is.And if you are still somehow convinced that Mayorkas’s open border policy is based on compassion, think again. Everyone knows the trek across the southern border is incredibly dangerous, but a recent GAO report found that, in one particularly dangerous part of the border, the official death count was off by more than 50%.Not only has Mayorkas’s open border policy encouraged over a million migrants in the past six months to risk their lives, but they don’t even know the full extent of it. Many men, women, and children have all died on the journey, and more recently, a Texas National Guard member died trying to save two migrants struggling in a river. The two migrants survived and found trafficking illegal narcotics.Rather than addressing these problems, Mayorkas has busied himself with the new \"disinformation\" board as an apparent top priority for national security. If that is not tone deaf, what is? He would rather create a disinformation board to target the political opponents of the Biden Administration than deal with the real and pressing threats caused by incompetent and dangerous border policies.People are dying, and families are mourning, because Mayorkas does everythingexcepthis job.Secretary Mayorkas, you have not upheld your oath of office. It is time to resign. Now.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP. MARK GREENRep. Mark Green, a Republican, is a physician and combat veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq, where he served three tours.
