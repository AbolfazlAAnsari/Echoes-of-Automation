We may pursue a partnering transaction with any company in any industry.\"If you invest in a SPAC, your money goes in an interest-bearing account that can only be used to acquire properties or be returned to you, should the SPAC management team (called \"sponsors\") fail to acquire properties in the allotted time, usually 18 to 24 months. Sponsors are paid in \"founder shares,\" bought at a discount and usually amounting to 20 per cent of the common stock of the future company, a nice relatively risk-free chunk of change framed as the sponsors' reward for not paying themselves exorbitant salaries during the brief shopping period.In the 1990s, investors jumped en masse into a tulipomania of stock-buying in companies that in many cases were little more than loose business plans scrawled on the backs of napkins. Crowds poured billions into names like Webvan, eToys and DrKoop.com(https://www.wsj.com/articles/dr-koop-com-epitomized-hype-of-tech-boom-and-bust-1430091217), which often barely had income, let alone profits.The SPAC boom takes the last IPO bubble and moves the speculative mania back a regulatory step or two, allowing money to be raised before any irritating disclosures have to be made about any concrete business plans. After all, the businesses don't exist yet. When you invest in a SPAC, you're investing in the reputations of its sponsors - i.e., names, not businesses.Although the money hasn't abated, investors are said finally to be grumbling over the lusciousness of the arrangement for SPAC directors. As Yahoo! noted, the \"intense competition for deals is beginning to erode returns,\" triggering a \"backlash from some investors over what they say has become a 'get-super-rich-quick' scheme.\" Of course, they say that like it's a bad thing. What's not to admire about a country that sells ideas it doesn't even have yet?This post originally appeared on Feb. 22 at taibbi.substack.com(https://taibbi.substack.com/p/financial-devils-dictionary-spac) and is republished here with permission. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
