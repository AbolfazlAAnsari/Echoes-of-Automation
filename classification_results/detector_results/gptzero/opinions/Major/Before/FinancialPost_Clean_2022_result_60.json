            "inputText": "Ed Waitzer's recent op-ed(https://financialpost.com/opinion/edward-waitzer-the-issue-at-the-osc-is-integrity-not-debate) (\"The issue at the OSC is integrity, not debate,\" July 14, 2022) expresses surprise and disappointment in my recent op-ed(https://financialpost.com/fp-finance/jeffrey-macintosh-conflict-at-the-osc-why-the-regulator-needs-to-make-room-for-dissent) (\"Conflict at the OSC: Why the regulator needs to make room for dissent,\" July 7, 2022). In that op-ed, I argued that lawyer Heather Zordel's appointment as non-executive chair of the OSC in March of this year should be met with open arms, as it introduces new points of view into what seems to be a rather intellectually closed shop. I don't suppose it will come as a shock to Ed Waitzer or anyone else that I am surprised and disappointed at his rebuttal.To begin with, it contains a number of inaccuracies. It states that Ms. Zordel was denied reappointment to her earlier position (2019-2021) as part-time commissioner. In fact, given her busy legal practice, she took herself out of the running. This puts a rather different complexion on the matter.And I never stated or implied that Ms. Zordel was not reappointed as part-time commissioner because of two dissenting opinions that she wrote as commissioner. My point was that for Ms. Zordel's critics the dissents were a factor in opposing her appointment as chair of the board.The nub of my argument was that the OSC could benefit from greater variety of viewpoints among its brass as to what investor protection and other aspects of the OSC's mission entail. By contrast, Mr. Waitzer argues: \"the importance of debate and dissent is not the point here.\" I beg to differ. As I indicated, some prominent accounts(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-heather-zordel-appointment-as-osc-chair-prompts-protest-resignations/) of Ms. Zordel's appointment have put a pejorative cast on her disagreements with her fellow commissioners. That puts the issue of debate and dissent front and centre.I certainly agree with Mr. Waitzer that the independence of administrative agencies is a cornerstone of our democracy. But does that mean that every administrative agency should be entirely divorced from any government oversight whatsoever - a little fiefdom unto itself and in no sense answerable to its political masters? Not a whit. It is the government that creates the agency, defines its mandate, gives it the powers that it needs to carry out that mandate and defines its organizational structure. And it is entirely within the purview of the government to enlist its legislative power to re-define that mandate, powers, and organizational structure if it chooses.We don't have to look into the distant past to find an example. On the advice of a non-partisan blue ribbon panel - the Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce (\"CMMT\") - the Conservative government has recently substantially reorganized the OSC via the Securities Commission Act, 2021 (declared in force in April). That legislation splits the adjudicative function (the \"Capital Markets Tribunal\") from the regulatory function. Moreover, where before the reorganization the OSC Chair and CEO were the same person, the two offices are now split. As expressed by the CMMT, \"The Board of Directors, led by the Chair, (will) focus on the strategic oversight and corporate governance of the regulator,\" while \"The CEO (will) be responsible for the overall management of the organization and execution of the OSC's mandate.\" The directors, including the chair, are all government appointees.This new structure, recommended by a non-partisan committee, gives the government of the day the power to influence, at the highest level, the strategic direction of the OSC. But why should it not? If the government is dissatisfied with the strategic vision or regulatory philosophy of the regulator or the manner in which it is being implemented, it would be profoundly anti-democratic - and at odds with the rule of law - to forbid the government from seeking to alter the agency's course.Indeed, the Ontario Securities Act states \"The Commission is an agent of the Crown in right of Ontario.\" The key word here is \"agent.\" It is not \"hegemony,\" \"fiefdom\" or \"satrapy.\" At the end of the day, the OSC is a government creation performing regulatory functions ceded to it by the government.Preston Manning: B.C. courts misread history in their health-care decisions(https://financialpost.com/opinion/preston-manning-b-c-courts-misread-history-in-their-health-care-decisions)https://financialpost.com/opinion/preston-manning-b-c-courts-misread-history-in-their-health-care-decisions(https://financialpost.com/opinion/jack-m-mintz-these-days-monetary-policy-rules)Opinion: Canada should stop stealing from drug companies(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-canada-should-stop-stealing-from-drug-companies)Do Ms. Zordel's conservative connections compromise the independence of the institution of which she is now head? Absolutely not. In the making of such appointments, the twin issues of competence and integrity will take up a lot of shelf space. But why should the government not also consider, if it chooses, whether potential nominees share the government's regulatory philosophyThe true worry about political interference is that the government might attempt to dictate or influence the result of particular cases. But the new legislation builds in the important protection of ceding no operational powers to the board of directors. Thus, aside from the government's power to approve or decline proposed rule changes (a longstanding feature of securities regulation), its sole discretionary avenue of influence lies in its power to appoint directors and hence influence high-level strategic direction.What is left of the argument that there has been inappropriate political interference over the OSC? Only the assertion that Ms. Zordel and three other part-time commissioners were appointed without the government having consulted the OSC, as has customarily been done. Yes, it would have been better if the government had consulted the OSC. In all likelihood, however, the outcome would have been the same. The OSC might not like not having been consulted but at best this is a foible not a fiasco.In the end, this tempest easily fits within a standard-issue teapot.Financial PostJeffrey MacIntosh is a professor of law at the Faculty of Law, University of Toronto, and a director of the Canadian Securities Exchange. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
