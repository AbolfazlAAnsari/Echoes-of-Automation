            "inputText": "By Raiyan ChowdhuryAs a front-line ICU physician in Alberta who studies health-care quality, one thing that has surprised me the most during this pandemic is the apparent free pass the Canadian academic community has afforded our federal leadership and its response during this crisis. The medical community seems to have focused its critique solely on public lockdown measures at the provincial level. Yet, there has been little academic discussion around our significant failures in early vaccine procurement, scientific understanding of how this virus spreads, rapid testing, and effective border control.Our collective public focus to date has been almost entirely on debating the acceptable degree of public lockdowns needed for the greater good. Pandemic shaming this year has rivalled hockey as a national sport. During the first wave, this likely served us well. Now, as the U.S. and U.K. outperform us in delivering vaccines to their peoples, our per capita infection rate has climbed above both. The CDC this month asked Americans to avoid all travel to Canada. For a country that often prides itself on being morally and socially superior to our southern cousins on matters of health and universal care, this inglorious distinction not only demonstrates our failures on COVID, but it shakes the very core of how we see ourselves as Canadians.On any given day, there is another expert or physician in the media criticizing the Doug Ford or Jason Kenney governments for not going far enough or acting fast enough on lockdowns. These critics may have valid points. However, as Toronto's year-long experience has shown, lockdowns alone are not enough to overcome this crisis. A singular focus on social-distancing measures both in the Canadian medical community and media has distracted from meaningful critique and debate about all other aspects of our COVID response. Improved responses in such areas of federal control as vaccine procurement and border control likely would have averted a third wave. Unfortunately, in these aspects, the academic community has been silent.The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommended delaying second doses of two-shot COVID-19 vaccines by up to four months. While this may be the most prudent action to take given our severe vaccine shortage, what has alarmed me is the deafening silence the academic community has had on this most significant public health policy decision, perhaps the most significant in decades. The original studies on vaccine efficacy had limited the intervals to under one month. Keep in mind that this is the same academic community that resisted early use of masks and border closures based on lack of evidence. Similarly, despite having had one year to enact an effective method of stopping COVID variants at our border, we have failed miserably at keeping out cases imported from such places as Brazil. Special screening for such travellers was dropped by Ottawa without as much as a peep from experts in our academic community.Theresa Tam, our top doctor, this month continued to claim that she was correct when she said COVID-19 posed only a low risk to Canada at the beginning of the pandemic. At the same time, Justin Trudeau has no regrets about our vaccine rollout. Of course, since Theresa Tam made that statement, over 23,000 Canadians have died. As for kudos for our national vaccine plan, Canada currently sits at number 45 worldwide when considering the total percentage of the population fully vaccinated.The field of health quality evolved in medicine because of statements such as these. Rather than accepting the status quo as the best we can do, the field of health quality determines the root causes for failures in our health-care system, and seeks to improve outcomes through culture and system changes. This is exactly what Canada's public health response needs now.Rupa Subramanya: Canada must immediately suspend flights to and from India(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rupa-subramanya-canada-must-immediately-suspend-flights-to-and-from-india)Matt Gurney: Doug Ford's bungling of the third wave is distracting from Justin Trudeau's many failures(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/matt-gurney-doug-fords-bungling-of-the-third-wave-is-distracting-from-justin-trudeaus-many-failures)We need to shift our focus towards determining the root causes of our failures on a local, provincial and federal level. The most commonly quoted reason for Canada's vaccine failure has been the lack of domestic vaccine production infrastructure as a result of years of neglect. This may be part of the story, but we really don't know. Without formal assessments of our response, using a health quality paradigm, we continue to place the lives of Canadians at risk. As for our economy, the world's longest undefended border will continue to be closed, but this time it's Americans who will want to keep us out.Blaming leaders such as Trudeau or Tam for uninspired leadership is likely an over-simplistic approach. However, we do have to hold them accountable. Otherwise, politicians claiming that this is the best we could do, will prevent us from finding the root causes of our failures and ultimately improving upon them.A first step is replacing the blame-and-shame game and focusing on systems thinking. We must have a paradigm that acknowledges the human condition - namely, that humans err. A single \"sharp-end\" error (the person in the control booth in the nuclear plant, the surgeon making the incision, a church ignoring lockdown rules, a PM high on platitudes but low on action) is rarely enough to cause harm on this level. Instead, Canada's failure has involved errors across all levels of government that penetrated multiple incomplete layers of protection. A focus on pandemic shaming or being a good Canadian by taking it all in stride is unlikely to produce any meaningful changes to a response that's clearly broken. There is nothing unCanadian or partisan about demanding a high-profile independent inquiry into our response now.Only by holding our leaders accountable and demanding improvements and change will we be better prepared to prevent a future crisis or, God forbid, a fourth wave this fall. We owe at least that much to the Canadians who will unnecessarily die in this third wave.Raiyan Chowdhury is a critical care medicine specialist and surgeon at the University of Alberta. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
