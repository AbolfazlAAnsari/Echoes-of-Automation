But nowadays most congressmen fly to Washington on Monday night, huddle with their teammates and do battle for three days, and then fly home on Thursday night. Cross-party friendships are disappearing ... scorched Earth politics are increasing.\"The new senators and representatives elected last week will join a Congress that is more polarized than at any other time over the past 50 years, according to a2022 analysisby the Pew Research Center.Members of Congress have also become less civil. Between 2009 and 2019, incivility on Twitter by senators and representatives increased by 23%, according to a 2022 study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science.It will take a whole lot to overcome this. Here's a small but positive way to start: Members of Congress should move their families to live in Washington, DC, with them.Brad Fitch, president and CEO of the nonpartisan Congressional Management Foundation, told me that there is no official data on where members of Congress live, but \"the percentage of members of Congress in the 117th Congress who have their families living in the Washington area is extremely small.\" He estimates that less than 20% of Congress people may have moved their families to the nation's capital. By contrast, he says, 20 to 30 years ago, the majority of members of Congress moved their families to Washington, DC, when they took office.Things changed in 1995 when then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich encouraged his party to keep their families in their districts. Now, many membersreturn hometo see their families and constituents --  and fundraise -- on the weekends.  With this kind of a work schedule, members of opposite parties aren't just unlikely to be friends -- theymay not even know one anotherat all.Unsurprisingly, between 1989 (when more members of Congress lived with their families in Washington, DC) and 2017, the number of bipartisan bills introduced in the first legislative session each year fell 30%,according to Quorum, a company that makes public affairs software.But if their kids went to school together and became friends (something that could naturally happen if they all lived in the capital), or they got together with their spouses for dinner, they could have the opportunity to come to see each other as decent human beings.That would make it a whole lot harder to turn around and throw vitriol at one another on Twitter. It's easy to attack someone you don't know. It's a lot less comfortable to call your neighbor who you run into around town or sit behind at your kid's school play a vicious name.If they lived in the same place, members of Congress would also inevitably get to know one another better. That just might help cultivate the kind of Biden-McCain or Hatch-Kennedy relationships that could allow them to get more bipartisan deals done.One challenge would be the cost of maintaining homes for their families in both places. The cost of living in Washington, DC, is 39% higher than the national average,according to the job site Payscale. So it could be a lot cheaper for members of Congress to bunk up with a few colleagues in a shared apartment while they are in Washington, DC, and leave their families back home.Members also have an incentive to maintain some sort of additional home in their districts if they want to run for reelection, since the US Constitution says a member of Congress isrequiredto \"be an Inhabitant\" of the state he or she is elected to represent.Members of Congress haven't received a raise since 2009. Their salary stands at$174,000. While that's a lot more than that of the average American, it could still make maintaining a second household in such a costly city a challenge. But if members of Congress passed legislation giving those who move their families to Washington, DC, additional housing stipends, it would be well worth the investment.The partisanship and incivility plaguing Congress will likely make it hard for members of the 118th Congress to overcome their differences. But making their primary houses in the nation's capital could foster the kind of old-fashioned bipartisan friendships that over time could make for a more civil and productive people's house (and Senate).Opinion by Kara AlaimoTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
