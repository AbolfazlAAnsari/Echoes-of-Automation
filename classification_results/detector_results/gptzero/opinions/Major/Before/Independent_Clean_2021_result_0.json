The long-sightedness of old age can be affected by cataracts to the point where it is not possible to see clearly. The future world is not ours, but that of the young – and the young overwhelmingly wanted to remain in the EU.Onwards and upwards, because that is the only direction we have left, but a lot of spade work will be required. A case of incy wincy spider climbing the spout again.Lesley SalterStockbridge, HampshireMark Steel’s clever, humorous column ('Here’s to Britain’s future – and the beaming nation of happiness Brexit has made us’, 31 December) highlights the fundamental dishonesty of Brexit and those who led us to this point.The 48 per cent who voted Remain in 2016 have lost everything with this bad deal. Many of the 52 per cent who voted Leave have also been cheated of the kind of Brexit they were promised. Only a small number of right-wing populist disrupters and a group of mainly wealthy, privileged ideologues have achieved almost all that they wanted.In a democracy there should be something for everyone, especially in the circumstances of the 2016 referendum. Regardless of the 2019 Conservative election manifesto, this Brexit was not proposed at the time of the referendum and that is what matters.Given this situation means that many have lost most of what they hold dear, and the majority have lost much, is it realistic for either victorious or defeated politicians to call for unity? “Putting it behind us” isn’t going to work. Where are the concrete actions needed to ensure former Remainers of all classes feel that their opinions count? Where is the Truth and Reconciliation Commission?David LowndesSoberton, HampshireAn apologyFirst of all let me unreservedly and sincerely apologise to Peter Cox (Letters, 31 December), G Barlow and Eric Wolff (Letters, 30 December), and to anyone else offended by my deliberately provocative remarks about whingeing and brainwashing. It was done to highlight what I believe is one cause of our severely fractured society. That is that any attempt at dialogue between the two sides of the debate has been conducted with extreme hostility between the parties.From Sir Anthony Seldon's fine article today it appears that this was a deliberate ploy by the Remain side but I suspect that the Leave side was no less to blame.That was bad enough but I also beleive that the behaviour and poor standard of debate in parliament, post 2016, coupled with the same outright hostility and refusal to put heads together for the greater good set a poor example to us all. This was surely one debate where suspension of party based politics and the creation of a cross party committee to try to see a way forward at he time should have occurred. Theresa May made an effort with this with Jeremy Corbyn but party politics again stifled the initiative.I am hugely encouraged both by the approach of Sir Keir Starmer and also Jess Phillips, whose article, ‘Enough of ‘Remainers’ and ‘Leavers’ – we are all in this together now’, (31 December) should be prescribed reading for those keen to move on by consensus from the current impasse.The way forward from here is surely constructive debate both in parliament and the wider public domain. I have great hopes that Sir Keir Starmer, Jess Phillips and a new look Labour front bench will engage in constructive dialogue with the government and prove that they are a credible government in waiting for the next election.Once agan, sincere apologies to those offended by my jibes last Monday, I was simply trying to highlight what I see as the big problem of the whole debate.Arthur SmithWarringtonBrexit in AmbridgeCongratulations to the BBC, which has just celebrated the 70th anniversary of The Archers – the world’s longest-running drama series. It will be interesting to hear in the coming months and years how the country folk of Ambridge cope with life fully outside the EU.Perhaps Ambridge should re-establish its links with the fictitious village of Meyruelle in France (twinned with some 30 years ago) to compare how the two fare. Given the programme has over 5 million listeners, it might dissuade the government from reneging on its promises to farmers.Roger HindsSurreyBang out of orderI have not been directly affected by Covid-19. However, I have been deeply moved by the stories of suffering, grief and immense sadness. Listening to doctors in hospitals in and around London pleading for new year restraint, would it not have shown some solidarity and respect to have cancelled London’s firework display, which does speak of celebration, for just one year?Patricia SlackRochdaleIn praise of front-line workersWhat a magnificent job our front-line staff have done this year. The NHS has faced its most challenging time ever. Doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers, porters and so on: these people are second to none. I even heard a rumour that Sir Patrick Vallance has himself been lending a hand in hospitals.I stand in awe and praise of our country in its ultimate hour of need.Geoffrey BrookingHavant, HampshireRead MoreThere are plenty of reasons not to cut the overseas aid budgetHow not to reconcile voters on either side of the Brexit debateLockdown the UK now to save lives and to protect the NHS"
