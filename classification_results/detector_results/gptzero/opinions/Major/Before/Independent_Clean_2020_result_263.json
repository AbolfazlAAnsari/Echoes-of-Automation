His family is too high profile and only as the president can he hope to keep all the allegations against him and his companies at bay.Alan HutchinsonAddress suppliedExcuse me, but was the James Moore article about Trump? As I had to keep checking it wasn't about someone closer to home because there were so many similarities with the British situation.Richard MasonLeedsCrossroadsThe government's new measures to boost employment opportunities in the post-Covid-19 economy are to be welcomed, and will help transform our skills system for the better. However, we must not solely focus on changing policies to be successful, we must also put great emphasis on changing employees' mindset when it comes to addressing some of the systemic issues exacerbated by the pandemic (eg. the UK's faltering productivity, widening skills gap and failing social mobility).Worryingly, CIMA's research in 2019 revealed that 37 per cent of UK workers didn't feel that they need to learn new skills, despite a growing awareness of the impact of technology on jobs. This complacency towards learning and development was a nagging issue prior to the coronavirus crisis but has now become an acute problem for UK businesses and could hamper our long-term recovery.If we are to get the economy back on its feet, remain competitive on the global scene and sustain growth, we must now invest wisely into developing a skilled, motivated workforce, think about changing the Apprenticeship Levy to an Apprenticeship and Skills Levy for all workers to ensure businesses have the talent they need now and in the future, continue to invest towards higher level apprenticeships to raise the skill levels of the UK workforce, and introduce a rebuttable right to retrain to empower workers to request further training and development. If such measures are adopted, we might then really be able to drive real-wage growth, address social mobility and become a productive economy.We are now at a crossroads - the choices we make now will make or break our success.Andrew HardingChief executive, Management Accounting, The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, part of the Association of International Certified Professional AccountantsShort circuitYou appear to advocate for a short \"circuit breaker\" (Editorial, 29 September). It would be worth looking at the experience of Melbourne, Australia, before going down this road. There, even with a much greater level of lockdown than we ever faced, it took many weeks to bring the daily case rate down from the high hundreds to the low tens.The virus has a long latency time, and we mostly don't live alone, but in households with others. It can take much more than two weeks for everyone in the house to get the infection and reach the point where they are not a risk to others.We can either adopt the most stringent methods, as in New Zealand and Australia, for as long as it takes, or direct our efforts to protecting the most vulnerable and the NHS, and otherwise get on with our lives. Tinkering at the edges with opening hours and group sizes will only make things worse.Rachael PadmanNewmarket, Suffolk,Do-doI read Alastair Campbell's column with great interest. It concerned the lamentable ineffectiveness of our current government's actions or, more precisely, their ideological based inaction, in response to the coronavirus pandemic.Alloying the fact that Baroness Dido Harding's previous employment with TalkTalk would enable his conclusion to see Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock, Baroness Harding et al, \"who do a lot of talk, talk. It is the do, do that is going less well.\"This is where my perception differs; from the outset of Mr Johnson's leadership, I so often only detect the noxious whiff of \"do-do\" in his bid to defile the reputation of this once proud, stable and reliable nation.Nigel PlevinIlminster, SomersetRead moreThe government's obsession with catchy slogans is distracting us from serious failingsOne million lives have been lost to coronavirus, but it's never too late to fight back"
