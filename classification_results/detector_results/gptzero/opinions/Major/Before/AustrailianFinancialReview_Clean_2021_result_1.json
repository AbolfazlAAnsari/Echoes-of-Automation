            "inputText": "Defamation This court decision shows that honest opinion is anything but free due to Australia's unfair laws.Another day, another chipping away of free speech by our courts. Such is my feeling towards the judgment handed down yesterday by the Federal Court in the Elaine Stead defamation case brought against this newspaper's columnist Joe Aston and its then publisher, Fairfax Media.While the damages award of $280,000 wasn't over the top - unlike many other defamation cases in recent memory - this is about the only thing positive in the case for the media.For those who may not have followed the case or have managed to forget everything that happened in 2020, yesterday's decision by the Federal Court followed from hearings conducted last month about Rear Window columns by Aston published in February and October of 2019. Stead had also sued over a Tweet - but that part of the case fell away after an earlier Court ruling.Stead claimed the columns were defamatory of her, and after a hearing on what imputations - meanings - were conveyed by the publications, his Justice Michael Lee ruled on December 7, 2020 that the comments meant that Stead \"is a cretin\", \"rashly destroyed capital causing enormous losses\", \"made stupid investments . . . which had no prospects of success\", and \"is an untrustworthy venture capitalist who fails to deliver on her promises to shareholders and investors\".For someone in Stead's position, these were serious allegations and obviously things she would not have been happy with.The imputations found by Lee were different to the ones pleaded by Stead. That in itself demonstrates some of the inherent unfairness in Australia's defamation laws. While it might seem unfair to the media that the applicant in a defamation case is entitled to place the case's virtual goalposts where they see fit by pleading the imputations, it is even more unfair when those goalposts are moved during the case by the judge. That is not to be critical of Lee, but rather of the law that allows such a situation.So the evidence proceeded in December on the imputations found by His Honour and that evidence made for great theatre.While not much good has come from COVID-19, one positive thing is the public's access to our courts. Before the pandemic, the Stead v Aston showdown would have been seen only by court reporters and media lawyers. At best, people might have followed it through media reports that tried to give a flavour of the tone of the evidence. But it seems we have all become more adept at doing things online - including the courts - and so there were far more online spectators in this trial than could have been accommodated in the courtroom.And it was entertaining. At times it seemed almost a competition as to who could be the most entertaining - Aston; his witty barrister Sandy Dawson, SC; the tough Sue Chrysanthou, SC, for Stead; or even His Honour. Aston probably took the cake with his Forrest Gump quote - sorry, his evidence - about his views on Stead and her conduct, saying: \"Stupid is what stupid does.\"The hearings concluded on December 11, with the judgment handed down in an impressively short six weeks, meaning Lee likely worked on the decision while the rest of us enjoyed our Christmas turkey.It's also one of the more entertaining judgments you are likely to read.The biggest battleground in the case lay in the defences pleaded by the respondents. In fact, the whole case turned on the \"honest opinion\" defence contained in section 31 of the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW). The respondents did not plead the common law defence of \"fair comment\" but relied solely on its section 31 equivalent.Although the judge found the views expressed by Aston were his honest opinions, ultimately he decided against Aston and the paper because he thought they had not proved the truth of certain \"facts\" that underpinned the opinion. This was the crux of the decision.Proving the facts underlying your opinion seems fair and appropriate on the surface. You might think the media would have nothing to complain about. However, the \"facts\" Lee said needed to be proved were ones he - not Aston or the paper - decided.In my view, some of these \"facts\" were really part of the opinion. For example, Lee found it was necessary for Aston and the paper to prove that a particular business \"was a worthless start-up with no prospects of success\". To me, whether something is worthless or has no prospect of success is of such a nature that it must be an opinion. It seems unfair to me that the first time the respondents find out the ruling on what \"facts\" they have to prove is in the judgment - far too late to then try and prove them.But that is Australia's defamation laws in action.And while new laws are on the horizon, even if they'd been applied here, the result would have been the same.Our defamation laws are supposed to balance protecting reputations with ensuring free speech.
