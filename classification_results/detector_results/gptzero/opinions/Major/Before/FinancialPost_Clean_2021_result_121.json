            "inputText": "One of the fundamental precepts that medical students are taught is that \"children are not little adults.\" This cardinal tenet recognizes that the unique development and physiology of children cannot be managed the same way that we approach the medical care of adults. For pediatricians, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of this concept. Initial understanding of this virus required a similar approach to the management and prevention of COVID in both children and adults.Over the past year, collective understanding of this virus and the consequences of prevention strategies has matured. Clinical and societal policies, including school closures, must reflect this improved understanding and we must recognize a different approach is necessary for the long-term health of our children.Children are at an exceedingly low risk for developing(https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html) severe or life-threatening symptoms from COVID. Rates of pediatric hospitalization or fatality are remarkably low and are, in fact, less than for influenza(https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/fluwatch/2018-2019/annual-report.html#f2) and other similar viruses. Despite media reports, the rate of COVID variant-driven hospitalization over recent weeks has resulted in no increase in the rates of pediatric hospitalization(https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data). While tragic pediatric fatalities with COVID-19 have occurred, the risk is over 8,000 times less likely than our elderly populations.Despite initial concerns about increased transmission among children, they are not the \"super-spreaders\" that we once assumed. While children, like adults, can contribute to the spread of this virus, COVID outbreaks in schools are lower than in many workplace and communal settings(https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data). Likewise, the transmission to adults working in childcare or school settings has also been demonstrated to be less than in other workplaces(https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00024-9/fulltext). Our children's experience with COVID demonstrates a vastly different risk than with adults.The most significant and rapid physiologic developments occur during childhood and adolescence. Lockdowns intended to limit COVID-19 spread, including school closures, lead to immediate and long-term impairment to children by interrupting the educational measures designed to support childhood development. School settings not only provide the foundation for educational development, but they also foster mental, social and physical growth. Prolonged interruption of in-person attendance disrupts(https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/covid-19-and-learning-loss-disparities-grow-and-students-need-help#) this critical time and can result in long-term deficiencies, especially among children who are already struggling. While virtual learning was a reasonable initial approach at the start of this pandemic, for most students, it isnot a suitable alternative(https://www.wsj.com/articles/failure-in-the-virtual-classroom-11592776152) for quality long-term education, and for children with pre-existing learning difficulties or developmental delay, this online approach is a failure(https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-student-equity-and-inclusion-supporting-vulnerable-students-during-school-closures-and-school-re-openings-d593b5c8/).Furthermore, virtual learning neglects the fundamental need for social and physical interaction. The critical role of schools in the social development of children has been well recognized. Schools also serve as a primary source of athleticism and exercise for children. Alongside this shift to an online environment, we have seen a steady decline in physical activity and a resultant increase in obesity(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33673078/ ). This ensuing weight increase will put our youth at risk for long-term complications of obesity, and the tragedy of this preventable epidemic will be apparent for decades to come. These imprinted patterns of behaviour for learning, socialization and exercise can and will persist throughout childhood, adolescent and adult lives. Schools are fundamental to the health and success of our youth at a time when their development is being so importantly shaped. Our educational investment is time-sensitive and these social and educational deficiencies are likely to endure in many of our children, especially the underprivileged.Confused about vaccine safety and efficacy? An infectious disease expert answers some common questions(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/confused-about-vaccine-safety-and-efficacy-an-infectious-disease-expert-answers-some-common-questions)Alex Kolbasnik: Sick children deserve priority vaccine access(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/alex-kolbasnik-sick-children-deserve-priority-vaccine-access)Children have limited capacity to advocate for themselves. As parents, teachers, medical professionals and policy-makers, it is our responsibility to ensure the voices of our children are recognized. The Canadian Pediatric Society(https://globalnews.ca/news/7845209/covid-canadian-paediatric-society-letter/) and the Pediatricians of Ontario(https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/furey-ontario-schools-must-re-open-immediately-say-sickkids-cheo-and-others) have spoken out and called for a return to school and outdoor activity. These groups recognize that for many children, schools are responsible for their primary nutritional and safety needs. Educators are often the first to recognize the signs of abuse and neglect in children; the very real potential for at-risk students to never attend school because of fully online learning can lead to chilling consequences(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213421001265).Despite being unable to speak out, children and adolescents often use actions to protest their distress. While pediatric hospital wards were once filled with infectious illnesses, medical units are now witnessing staggering increases(http://cmho.org/covid-19-mental-health-impacts/ ) in overdoses, life-threatening eating disorders(https://doi-org.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2021.101505), and suicide attempts.(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/pandemic-safety-measures-%20children-teen-health-impact-1.5953326) Calls to help lines have increased significantly and the decline in children's mental health is a growing concern for parents(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2779300) and educators. Political and medical leaders must listen to the messages that are clearly being vocalized by pediatric medical professionals and by the actions of the children who have limited voice.There is no dispute regarding COVID-19's devastating impact on our adult population, an impact ever less severe as a result of vaccines. Parents, educators, pediatricians and politicians must now advocate for appropriate short- and long-term strategies for our children. Children are fundamentally physiologically, socially, psychologically and developmentally different than adults and it is a fundamental failure to subject them to these prolonged school closures and restrictions. \"Children are not little adults\" and the management of this precious resource during the COVID-19 pandemic will undoubtedly shape our society's future.Dr. Douglas Mack is an assistant clinical professor, pediatrics, in the faculty of health sciences at McMaster University.
