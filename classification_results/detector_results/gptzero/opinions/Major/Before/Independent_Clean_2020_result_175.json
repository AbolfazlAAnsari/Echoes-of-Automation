Nothing more, nothing less.Tony Tugnutt                                           EythorneThe unsackablesDominic Cummings, Robert Jenrick, Matt Hancock, Dominic Raab, Gavin Williamson, Priti Patel, Helen Whately, Alok Sharma. In normal times they would all be long gone by now. In the hands of our illustrious prime minister, however, they are the unsackables. Of course, scapegoats can come in handy, but inevitably the reckoning will come and no matter how many scapegoats are put in the way, Boris Johnson alone must be held to account for the gargantuan mess we now find our nation mired in.Paul Morrison                                          Address suppliedDriving accidentsIn response to the terrorist killings in Reading, Priti Patelsaid: \"We have to look at all aspects of what happened on Saturday, and the individual as well, to ensure, yes, that justice is served, but also we make sure that we learn the lessons from what has happened over the weekend, to prevent anything like this happening again.\"Doesn't it beg the question: With over 120 years of innocents being killed by motor vehicles, (first pedestrian in 1896) why is it still happening?We've learnt that seat belts, airbags, and crumple zones, can help save the lives of drivers, so why haven't we learnt that speed limiters can help save all lives, and thereby, protect the NHS? They would also prevent the need for police chases, time and resources needed to tackle terrorism.We use smart meters to stop people stealing gas and electricity, so why not speed limiters to stop drivers \"stealing\" lives?Allan Ramsay                                          RadcliffeBrexit regrets\"Four years ago, I voted for Brexit. If only I'd known then what we all know now,\" laments Sean O'Grady (Voices, 23 June). Would it not be better if in addition to your claim that The Independent \"employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism\", you employed some with the ability to foresee the likely results of their actions?Eddie Dougall                                          Bury St EdmundsBlack lives for all livesWhile Premier League footballers admirably displayed solidarity with theBlack Lives Mattercause, someone saw it fit to pay for a banner to be flown above the match between Burnley and Manchester City with the phrase \"White Lives Matter\". Similar chants echoed in Trump rallies. Of course white, brown, black and all the skin shades in between matter. All lives matter. That is precisely why black lives matter. This is not about tribalism based on skin colour. It is about justice and equality for all.When disabled people are given dedicated parking space, this is to ensure that they are not disenfranchised. That's precisely why those with racist instincts are disingenuous and missing the point altogether. Black people have been mistreated and marginalised for centuries, with slavery and colonialism the darkest episodes. This has poisoned our culture and normalised the killing of black people at the hands of the police, indiscriminate incarceration and workplace discrimination. That's why they deserve our attention and support now in their fight for justice. If one of your children is taken ill, you will devote your attention to them. That doesn't mean you don't care about the others. You simply want to make sure they are all well.Ali Abbas                                          London NW10"
