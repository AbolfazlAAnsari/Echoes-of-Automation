There is a problem here, though: by avoiding ad hominem attacks on people like Suella Braverman out of civility, attacking the ball and not the (wo)man, you avoid any discussion of the morality of what she has done, of her apparent lack of empathy or sense of the preciousness of human life. Because it is not the ball that is at fault, here, it is the (wo)man, and if we accept into civil debate the stance that refugees are “invaders”, we normalise what is abhorrent.Civility is great, but it is not the highest virtue. Yet civilly, and without personal attack, I say simply that these events are extremely dark and the time to debate who was rude to whom is long gone.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
