Please send your letters toletters@independent.co.ukYet again we are subject to obfuscation and deferral by this \"too little, too late\" government.Last year, following similarly poor judgement over one day, namely Christmas Day, the NHS was put under crippling pressure, but then people had not been mixing, so the usual level of influenza was absent. This year, with people already mixing as if life was back to normal, with NHS staff already absent in large numbers and with a variant that spreads up to five times as fast, this is no time for vacillation.If the NHS is overwhelmed followingthe superspreader event of Christmas, then it will be entirely down to the government and its rank cowardice in facing up to the dogmatic right wing of the Conservative Party. This unholy alliance, having damaged the nation in terms of Brexit, now threatens the NHS and may cause many thousands of unnecessary deaths. The Conservative Party, which succours this dogma, is responsible and must be held accountable at the ballot box at every opportunity.Arthur StreatfieldBathExtra homeworkThe schools may have broken up for Christmas but it's detention for many Tory backbenchers. It's not so much following the science that is needed but following the basic maths of infection transmission. So here's a little advent calendar for our Covid-challenged MPs. On 1 December there is one Omicron case and the R number is 2. How many cases of infection would you expect by Christmas Day?The answer is more than 16 million. And some health experts are estimating the R number of Omicron at between 3 and 5. Many MPs have still failed to grasp the basics. Still, plenty of time for extra revision while not partying.Brian FergusonYorkOf course!Common sense needs to be applied to rein in the hysteria over the garden party photograph. Clearly, it is our cabinet testing English wine and cheese to demonstrate the benefits of Brexit.Paul DicksonPeebles, ScotlandSurveillance can halt abuseThe public outpourings of grief andoutrageover the terrible ordeals and deaths of thechildrenStar Hobson andArthur Labinjo-Hughesneeds action beyond a flood of cards,flowersand hastily convened discussion groups.Although the number of children killed in families since 2004 currently stands at a horrifying 69, little coordinated and effective action has been taken. In the majority of these cases, warning signs raised by relatives, neighbours, schools and health professionals have then not been coordinated and case-conferenced by social services.My experience from 25 years as a social worker and guardian ad litem suggests that, after two case conferences where major concerns are raised, social workers should be able to apply to the family court to enlist specialist intelligence-gathering agencies with powers to use covert surveillance. Such powers are already invoked in the case of suspicion of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, terrorism and organised crime. Is the prevention of crime against children really any less important to us? Without such surveillance, the ability of overstretched, under-resourced child protection agencies to gather impartial, irrefutable evidence of criminal abuse is effectively zero.Name and address supplied'Eff offI enjoyed Andrew Gold's article, 'The changing nature of offence and why it causes pain' (20 December).As the last person arrested for blasphemy in this country,as mentioned by Andrew, I wanted to add a footnote. From 1995 I taught at AS Neill's notorious Summerhill School. Here, in 1999, during the Ofsted inspection, which resulted in the 2000 Royal Courts of Justice case defending the school against closure (featured inBBC drama Summerhill), I swore in front of the man responsible for secondary school inspection in England.Cliff Gould HMI spoke to me after my GCSE science lesson on kidneys. He asked me if I was aware of what I had said. I replied that I had used the word \"piss\" instead of \"excretion\" because I was more interested in teaching how things work rather than terminology. He look nonplussed. \"Oh, you mean when I told the two boys to 'f**k off if they were not interested'\"?He explained that he would automatically have to write to my headteacher reporting the incident, and they would be expected to give me a written warning, three of which would result in my dismissal. I laughed and referenced the school rules, which stated that it was OK to swear so long as you did not upset anyone and it was not done outside the school.In the Ofsted report of 1999, which recommended the school be closed, it stated \"inappropriate use of language by teachers\". The school is celebrating its centenary this year, as the oldest school in the world based on children's rights, active citizenship and democracy. Summerhill has been swearing for a century, without censorship, and long may it continue.Michael NewmanLondon E14More Christmas present dilemmasI have just read Rupert Hawksley's article regarding Christmas presents and agreeing not to exchange ('Help! What to do when people ignore a 'no presents' rule at Christmas?', 19 December). I really cannot see the problem. I was brought up that Christmas was about giving and not receiving and that it was a token to show friendship and love. I have no problem in giving a present because I want to, not on the basis I get one back. Problem solved.N SmithPulborough, West SussexA number of charities offer gifts to be given on behalf of the recipient. I started doing this three years ago for my large family and this year the senior members will know they are each giving 25 Covid jabs to hospital staff in Nepal. If he must, Rupert Hawksley can always wrap his charity token up in a parcel, to satisfy those who want something to open on the day and his need to reciprocate.Gillian CookMarket Harborough, LeicestershireMy way around this would be to buy a big shareable box of luxury chocolates or some delicious wine. You get to have a share in your generosity too!Marilyn TimneyLiss, HampshireRead MoreLetters: Our politicians certainly seem to enjoy drinking on the jobLetters: Lord Frost resigned over Covid measures - yeah, rightLetters: Boris Johnson keeps scoring own goals - time to send him off the pitchLetters: Our politicians certainly seem to enjoy drinking on the jobLetters: Lord Frost resigned over Covid measures - yeah, rightLetters: Boris Johnson keeps scoring own goals - time to send him off the pitch"
