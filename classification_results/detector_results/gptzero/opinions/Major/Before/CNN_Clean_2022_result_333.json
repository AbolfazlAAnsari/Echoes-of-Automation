In states where abortion is illegal, personal data can besubpoenaedfromtech companies, like what happened to Burgess, orboughtfrom a third-party data broker. Your period tracking app can flag a pregnancy before you're even aware, your texts and emails could provide incriminating evidence, and as more red states consider abortiontravel bans, your location tracking data or electronic transaction records might reveal a trip to Planned Parenthood in a neighboring state -- and the government can use all of that data against you in court.Burgess's story is, tragically, one of many. Even before Roe was overturned, women's data wasweaponized against them.It's particularly alarming that women and girls are targeted online when we are already at adisadvantageto men when it comes to digital literacy. We know that American girls aremost likelyto abandon computer science courses between the ages of 13 and 17. As they grow up, they'reless confident in their digital skills, andless sure of their ability to find the informationthey are searching for online. It's no wonder that women comprise only aquarter of STEM professionals, andearn lessin those positions than their male counterparts.This digital gender disparity is why I founded Girls Who Code 10 years ago. Today, I'm proud to say we're on track toclose the gender gapin new entry-level tech jobs by 2030. But that success doesn't just prove women and girls' appetite for STEM -- it offers a blueprint for the massive education effort needed to enhance young women's digital literacy and safety.Part of that effort must be learning and sharing the simple tips for safer online interactions: using encrypted communications apps like Signal, making phone calls via Google Voice, creating (and promptly deleting) new email accounts to coordinate appointments and transit.For the more complicated stuff, we should rely on and support nonprofits likeElectronic Frontier Foundation,Fight for the FutureandDigital Defense Fund, which mobilized to help us understand both technology itself and our rights using it.Over the past few months, they've assembled an arsenal of resources that specifically advise abortion-seekers about surveillance, providing them with best encryption practices and private internet browser recommendations. We can even consult the Department of Health and Human Services' newguidanceunder the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for securing one's personal health data.We must urge our legislators to protect women's privacy by curbing abusive data practices and instituting stronger consumer privacy protections through proposed legislation like Sen. Elizabeth Warren'sHealth and Location Data Protection Act, or Rep. Sara Jacobs'My Body, My Data Act.And if tech companies want to regain our trust, they must becomepart of the solution. In addition to making end-to-end encryption the default setting in messaging apps, they can refuse to comply with requests for data that violate civil liberties, and evendeletesuch data to protect our privacy.In all of this work, we must ensure digital privacy education reaches those who need it most. Historically, manyAsian, Black, Indigenous and Latino women,those from immigrant communitiesandwomen with low incomeshave simultaneouslysufferedfrom disproportionate police violenceand are deprived of adequate healthcare,sex educationand other critical resources necessary for reproductive justice. We can't have true digital inclusion -- and justice -- if only some women can access this information.In Justice William O. Douglas' majority opinion in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), the court established the right to privacy -- and by extension, women's bodily autonomy -- within the \"penumbra\" of the Bill of Rights, that sliver of partial illumination between\"perfect shadow\"and \"full light.\"For so long, women and girls have had to assert our right to privacy -- in our phones, our homes and in our bodies -- in the shadows of the law and technology. By empowering women with a knowledge of our digital rights, we inch our way towards the full light -- where we have always deserved to be.Opinion by Reshma SaujaniTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
