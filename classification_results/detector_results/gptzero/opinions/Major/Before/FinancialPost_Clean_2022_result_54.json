In fact, if hydrocarbons are being fast-tracked for extinction in Canada, why should we even care about future oil potential? We won't need to find any new oil reserves if we're not going to develop them.In a perfect world, such questions would be reasonable. But as the war in Ukraine has laid bare, companies and countries can pay a high price if they are not prepared for disruptions in their best-laid plans. Canadian energy companies have built up decades of credible expertise in oil exploration and production, and we don't know for certain what talents will be required in future to assure our own energy security or that of other nations. The oil business in Canada may well be in liquidation mode but if the timeline for transition to cleaner energy is disrupted, whether by game-changing technology or by geopolitical necessity, trading an opportunity to sustain a diversified mix of assets and skills in exchange for short-term efficiencies could end up being short-sighted.Donna Kennedy-Glans was Alberta's associate minister of electricity and renewable energy, 2013-14.
