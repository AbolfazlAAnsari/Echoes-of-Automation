            "inputText": "The agency says full vaccine approval rests on high-quality review. Also: Leaving Afghanistan; the trauma of loss; children&#39;s screen time; jobs and automation; cultured meat.To the Editor:Re “Vaccines Need Full Approval,” by Dr. Eric J. Topol (Opinion guest essay, July 5):We want to assure the public that the review of applications for full approval of Covid-19 vaccines is one of the highest priorities at the Food and Drug Administration. However, an extensive additional amount of manufacturing and clinical information has been collected since the emergency use authorizations and must be reviewed and evaluated by the agency as part of any applications submitted.Any vaccine approval without completion of the high-quality review and evaluation that Americans expect the agency to perform would undermine the F.D.A.’s statutory responsibilities, affect public trust in the agency and do little to help combat vaccine hesitancy.The F.D.A. is notable among the world’s regulatory agencies for its thorough scientific evaluation of submitted applications, which includes review and verification of data at the level of individual subjects enrolled in clinical trials. Our ability to fully approve the vaccines therefore depends on the submission of complete applications by the companies.This approach helps to ensure that the F.D.A. has all the available data from clinical studies and provides the public with trust and confidence in the quality, safety and effectiveness of any vaccine that the agency approves.As Dr. Topol correctly notes, all three Covid-19 vaccines currently authorized for emergency use in the United States have been thoroughly evaluated and have met, and continue to meet, the F.D.A.’s rigorous standards. If we truly want our lives to return to normal, the fastest way to do so is simple — get vaccinated right now.Peter MarksSilver Spring, Md.The writer is director of the F.D.A.’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.To the Editor:I couldn’t agree more with Eric J. Topol that the Food and Drug Administration needs to accelerate full approval of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. I have two granddaughters in their 20s who have adamantly refused to be vaccinated until full approval is given. I am sure they are not alone.While I support efforts like lottery tickets or other inducements to get the shots, a clear safety message from the F.D.A. would be a game changer. When I see the huge maskless crowds at many events, I worry for their safety. The F.D.A. needs to act, and to act now! For the protection of all.Richard GoetzDelray Beach, Fla.Lessons From Tragedy and Defeat in AfghanistanTo the Editor:Re “Biden Defends Afghan Pullout in Blunt Tones” (front page, July 9):The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan is a tragedy and a defeat on many levels. It is a tragedy for the loss of American and Afghan lives. It is a defeat for the idealism of nation building. It is a pending tragedy for the Afghans, who will be subject to the brutality of the Taliban as they begin the process of eradicating Western influence.It is a defeat for U.S. elected officials, who failed to develop stability policies and programs. It is a defeat for the American military, which despite overwhelming land and air resources was unable to develop the strategy and tactics to counter the Taliban. It is also a defeat for the United States as a global power — a loss of respect.Americans can now focus on the many pressing issues facing the nation at home, putting this sad chapter in our history behind us but hopefully not forgetting the lessons that brought tragedy and defeat.Ed HoulihanRidgewood, N.J.It’s Never Too Late to Confront TraumaTo the Editor:Re “We Need to Process What We’ve Lost” (Opinion guest essay, Sunday Review, June 27):Emily Esfahani Smith’s observation that “sometimes, a trauma can be so shattering that confronting it is unbearable” particularly resonated with me.It is never too late to revisit confronting one’s traumatic losses. When I was 20, my 49-year-old mother was dying in a hospital room after a three-year fight against cancer. My father, with the same disease (from which he would also die), was in another room on the same hospital hallway.While both had died by the time I was pregnant with my first child, I felt that the time was never right to confront my losses; I had to keep my head down, finish college, and then just get through everyday life raising young children without grandparents.For many years I couldn’t even speak about how my parents died. One acquaintance even asked me if they had been killed in a car accident. It was only many decades later that I was ready to process what happened with a therapist.To those suffering losses from the pandemic or other situations: Please don’t hesitate to speak to a professional, even if many years after the fact. Therapy will help when you’re ready for it.Laurie YarnellRye, N.Y.Children’s Screen TimeTo the Editor:Re “A Mental Health Crisis Flares Among Young Children” (news article, June 30):There is no question that there is a critical need to address the growing mental health crises occurring in young children. But it is equally important to also address the growing access children have (at increasingly younger ages) to the internet, smartphones and social media.This mental health crisis is not separate from children’s increased use of screens. As of 2019,one in five 8-year-olds had their own smartphone and spent on average nearly five hours a day online. These numbers have onlyincreased during the pandemic.Apps and social media platforms are designed to hook and hold our attention. This is calledpersuasive design. In children, whose brains are highly susceptible, algorithms feed them content based on their online behavior. If a child searches for “self-harm,” she will increasingly be guided toward content about self-harm.Children have become the collateral damage of this pandemic, and until changes are made to protect their mental health from the tentacles of the technology industry, this mental health crisis will only continue to grow.Emily CherkinSeattleThe writer is a former teacher who is now working as a consultant to parents on screen time issues.Robots at WorkTo the Editor:Re “Pandemic Wave of Automation May Erase Jobs” (front page, July 4):Automation and artificial intelligence are now predicted to soon take over much human work. Some thinkers clearly see the rapid rise of a large “useless class,” masses of people who can contribute little during their lifetimes because their skills are redundant or unnecessary.The implications for society are staggering, and we need to anticipate and thoughtfully plan now for these economic and social changes if democracy and free societies are to survive.Avrom JacobsJamaica Plain, Mass.Funding for Cultured Meat ResearchTo the Editor:While the origins of Covid-19 are debated, it remains true that animal agriculture greatly increases our pandemic risk. That’s why members of Congress should support federal funding for research on cultured meat, which is grown from cells, without raising and slaughtering livestock.“Both farmed and caged wild animals create the perfect breeding ground for zoonotic diseases,” Liz Spechtwrote for Wired.“Extraordinarily high population densities, prolonged heightened stress levels, poor sanitation, and unnatural diets create a veritable speed-dating event for viruses to rendezvous with a weakened human host and transcend the species barrier.”The private sector has made remarkable progress developing the field of cellular agriculture. But for cultured meat to succeed, government funding is necessary for open-access research. This will help producers reach price parity with slaughtered meat and develop whole-cut products, like cultivated steak and chicken breast. Legislators who hope to stop the next pandemic should support this vital work.Jon HochschartnerGranby, Conn.PHOTO:    (PHOTOGRAPH BY Christopher Payne, via Benrubi Gallery FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
