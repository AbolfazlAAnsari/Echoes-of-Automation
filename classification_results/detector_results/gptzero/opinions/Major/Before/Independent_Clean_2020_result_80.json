Once the pandemic is over, let's not return to a business-as-usual, live-only-for-today lifestyle.Resurrecting our economy is easier if it starts from a low-level post-coronavirus, rather than from our usual hectic world. Let's fast-track our way from a major downturn to a sustainable future. We will be en route for a new and exciting sustainable future, initiated by a tiny piece of protein. Indeed, we may thank the coronavirus for bringing us to our senses.Bob Pringle                                          AberdeenGood housekeepingOver the past week, my wife and I have visited two national chain supermarkets and the food hall of a national department store. All were experiencing shortages of the usual suspects - loo roll, pasta, flour etc. But their approach to maintaining their stores was very different. The food hall looked completely normal, with very few gaps in the shelves. One of the supermarkets had large gaps, but was clearly doing its best to maintain normality elsewhere. The other supermarket looked like a bomb site. Not merely gaps on shelves but seemingly random distribution of remaining stock.Maintaining at least a semblance of normality in the shops reassures customers, whereas the \"bomb site\" approach tends to promote panic and stockpiling. The irresponsible and irrational behaviour of customers who panic buy and stockpile is causing a major problem for grocery stores but they, in turn, have a responsibility to discourage panic buying. Good housekeeping is very effective.Bernard Cudd                                          MorpethHigher taxesThe government'seconomic packageto protect companies and wages (essential for maintaining law and order) and to enhance the NHS and social care will have to be paid for once theCovid-19pandemic is over. When that time comes, and in the future, instead of quibbling about paying higher taxes - or trying to avoid or evade them - we should realise that there are much more important things in life, such as life instead.Roger Hinds                                          CoulsdonBritain seems to be celebrating the government's Covid-19 response. At the risk of being out of step, again I ask with huge incredulity WHY?The countries that have this almost under control - China and South Korea - are those using targeted isolation and quarantine (which is different) and testing, testing and retesting.Why is everyone so keen on Boris Johnson's Bad Dad tactic? \"Here's a lot of money -​ go away for a while...\"Amanda Baker                                          Edinburgh"
