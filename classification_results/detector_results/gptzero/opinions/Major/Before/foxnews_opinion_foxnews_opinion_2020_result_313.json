We dealt with the constant swaying of opinions by our political and strategic leaders, even when they seemed to contradict themselves from one day to the next. But we had a mission, to keep one another safe and to make it back home, back to freedom and family.As a veteran, a survivor of an IED and a grateful American let me tell you this: you will get through this.Now, a decade later my heart breaks as I see a similar experience afflicting my precious nation, here in our own homes. Coronavirus attacks with the same veracity and no less uncertainty as bombs hidden in the ground. For me, there is no solace in the fact I have seen such a thing before. Simply put, I chose to go to that fight for the explicit purpose of ensuring such a fight wouldn’t come home to you. I can’t help but feel a semblance of failure seeing my fellow Americans needlessly suffer.So as a veteran, a survivor of an IED and a grateful American let me tell you this: you will get through this. The fear and pain will subside and in its place a renewed appreciation for your freedoms and safety. Like you’ve never known.You’ll be emotionally stronger, physically more resilient and collectively a better version of the greatest people on earth. Your memories of death and unfairness will be replaced by memorials of fearless sacrifice and common heroism. You’ll sleep better at night knowing we can endure because we do it together.You’ll know first hand what I’ve known now for so long. Americans don’t just survive tragedies of this kind, we thrive after them.As a veteran, my role in this is simple, to show you the way. To let you know it’s possible and to give any and everything I have to offer to help you through it.God bless those struggling with this illness, our front line medical workers saving lives by risking theirs, our first responders and military, the people who keep the lights and water running, and the people who keep our hearts full with hope and love. But most of all, God bless the PEOPLE of the United States of America.BY JOHNNY \"JOEY\" JONESJohnny \"Joey\" Jones joined FOX News Media as a contributor in 2019.
