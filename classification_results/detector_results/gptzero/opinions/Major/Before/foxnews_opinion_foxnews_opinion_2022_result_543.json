I watched with stars in my eyes as Title IX opened a world of new opportunities for women in sports. In 1972, there were just 300,000 women in high school and college sports in the U.S. But by 2012, that number had risen ten-fold to more than 3 million women. Wonderfully, I’ve continued to watch this number increase throughout my adult life.But now, 50 years after that iconic civil rights bill became law, female athletes are experiencing a different kind of injustice than what I faced. The root problem, however, remains the same: Women are being sidelined by men. Girls are losing opportunities and medals to boys.Today, women’s sports face an eroding landscape where males are displacing females because government officials and public schools and universities are allowing males who identify as women to compete on women’s sports teams. It doesn’t help that theU.S. Department of Education is exceeding its authorityby issuing new rules that essentially rewrite Title IX—and does so in a way that threatens the advancements women have achieved in education and athletics.In Connecticut, former high school track athlete Chelsea Mitchell lost four state championships and two all-New England awards because she was forced to compete against male athletes. And cross-country runner Madison Kenyon experienced a similar story at Idaho State University when she was forced to compete repeatedly against a male athlete—and lost each and every race. And who could miss the University of Pennsylvania’s Lia Thomas crushing all the female competitors at the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship 500-yard freestyle earlier this year?Chelsea Chelsea Mitchell is a college sophomore and track athlete. She is represented by Alliance Defending Freedom.(ADF)These stories are becoming more and more common as women share their own experiences and call out the unfairness of having to compete against men who are faster, stronger, and more muscular.Aftergraduating college, I coached the Muncie Northside High School volleyball team to two state championships. In those days, with Title IX so fresh, most high schools could not immediately fund and offer a multitude of girls’ sports teams, so a really good female tennis player, golfer, swimmer, or even softball player would be allowed to play on the boys’ team.And conversely, because there weren’t any boys’ volleyball teams, some boys at another high school were allowed to join the girls’ volleyball team. That meant my girls had to compete against boys in a power sport—boys who were 6-feet, 3-inches, strong, and skilled who fiercely pounded the volleyball high above the girls’ net. I saw the impact it had on my girls and how they had to fight to stay in the game.Today, brave young women are engaged in their own fight, much like I was. They’re finding their voices and standing up for fairness in women’s sports to protect a game they love.Recently, I was proud to join several young female athletes in a friend-of-the-court brief that Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in support ofIndiana’s new lawthat protects athletic opportunities for girls.Debbie Milbern Powers during her college yearsWomen of my age and older remember well a time before we had equal opportunities for scholarships, or even our own locker rooms.Our work continues today in ensuringgirls growing up in Indiana, and across the country, still have sports and educational opportunities.
