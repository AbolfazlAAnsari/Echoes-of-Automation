If history is any guide, giving new powers to the Competition Bureau to study and potentially push for the restructuring of markets would be a mistake.The Restrictive Trade Practices Commission, established under Canada's prior competition law, had the power to conduct market studies. Those market studies led to multi-year investigations into industries perceived to be the giants of the day - most famously the petroleum inquiry - but produced few economically positive outcomes. The petroleum inquiry fiasco was a meaningful contributor to the abolition of the market study power under Canada's current competition laws. The petroleum inquiry ran for many years, cost the government millions and the industry many millions more - with no tangible result. If the government needs to take quick action to stop abuses of market power, a market study doesn't do the trick.Parliament, in its wisdom, understood this.

That is why targeted and vigorous enforcement makes for better policy. For instance, enforcement action in the real estate industry broadened consumer access to \"sold\" prices giving brokerages with an online presence a better chance to compete.The dynamic nature of markets is also a challenge with enforcement of competition law but at least enforcement against particular conduct of a particular company has a specific focus; studying an entire industry to argue for a reset of the rules of the game is a much more ambitious undertaking. Those rules could become obsolete, and rigid, soon after they are established, and could become obstacles to effective competition in dynamic industries.Active and vigorous enforcement, not study, is the key to delivering on the promise of the Competition Act: to maintain and encourage competition in Canada, to promote the efficiency and adaptability of our economy, to expand opportunities for Canadian participation in world markets and to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises have an equitable opportunity to participate in the Canadian economy.But as of last summer, when the bureau released updated statistics, it had only a dozen active abuse of dominance investigations on the go. The bureau hasn't brought an abuse of dominance case before the Competition Tribunal in five years. A vigorous and active enforcer should be bringing cases not only to restore competition, but also to deter dominant firms in other markets from engaging in anti-competitive conduct.As the government considers policies to make Canada more competitive domestically and internationally, amending the Competition Act to enhance the bureau's market study powers should not be on its agenda. Rather, the government should make clear that its priority is to see our competition laws enforced to their fullest extent. Instead of giving the Competition Bureau new market study and remedy powers, the government should consider how it can properly resource the bureau to invigorate enforcement of existing competition law.Joshua Krane and Mark Opashinov are partners, and William Wu is an associate, in the Competition Group at McMillan LLPThe big issues are far from settled.
