Politicians give regular press conferences. Public health officials do the same. Advisory committees of independent experts speak up and challenge not only governments, but other experts. Researchers, clinicians and journalists all have something to say. Our fuzzy federalism makes this that much harder, as it multiplies voices and points of authority. In order to get through this third wave, and stave off a potential fourth wave in the fall, this needs to change.A look back at the last several weeks provides ample evidence of why Canadians are bewildered. As the third wave built in Ontario, public health experts recommended a draconian shutdown and paid sick leave for essential workers. The premier closed the schools (after some local medical officers of health acted on their own), but also outdoor playgrounds. He empowered the police to engage in random checks of out-and-about citizens. Howls of outrage from angry public health experts followed. Police forces almost uniformly said they would do no such thing.Then the chair of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), in the middle of a brutal third wave in Alberta and Ontario, told Canadians to wait for the mRNA vaccines if they were at low risk of catching COVID. Other public health experts piled on immediately and the prime minister asked Canadians to take any vaccine they could get as quickly as they could. No wonder people are confused.How do we reconcile the role of experts - who provide important advice to governments, yet often disagree amongst themselves in the face of rapidly evolving research - and the responsibility of elected officials to make decisions based on their advice?There are no easy answers here, but to successfully get through the third wave, and to stave off a fourth, the role of politicians and experts needs to be clarified. There is no trade-off between competent management of the pandemic and political success. The data are clear.At the start of the pandemic, provincial governments across Canada were buoyed by high approval ratings. Indeed, every provincial government had a score of +39 or greater, meaning that for every 100 people, 39 more people approved than disapproved of their provincial government's handling of the crisis.The second wave was the differentiator. Ontario, Quebec and the West fared relatively poorly, while Atlantic Canada maintained the highly effective Atlantic bubble. Since then, Atlantic Canada has largely been able to stay the course and has marshalled substantial public support in dealing with outbreaks.In contrast, governments in Alberta and Ontario failed to act swiftly as indicators clearly signalled a third wave was coming. Clearly, citizens noticed: provincial governments in Atlantic Canada still have a +40 approval rating for their handling of the pandemic, while in Ontario and Western Canada, it's at -2 and -3, respectively.There are a number of lessons we can learn from this about the appropriate role of politicians and experts. First, people are not good at intuitively understanding risk. Those who study decision-making have known this for a long time.When there is a one in 100,000 chance of a side effect from a vaccine, experts have to tell us that, but they should then put it in context: it's far lower than driving your car on the highway everyday and much less than catching COVID if you are living or working in an environment with even modest levels of community transmission.Experts need to explain the comparative risks to people using examples that are easy to understand. Talking about risk that way does not ignore the evidence or compromise the truth. On the contrary, putting risk in context helps people make better decisions.Likewise, political leaders have an obligation to listen carefully to the scientists and the public health experts. But it should come as no surprise that these two groups can disagree with each other and even amongst themselves in the face of new research.So the premiers and the prime minister should level with the public. When they're announcing a decision, they should tell us if they were the ones who ultimately made the call because their experts were divided. If the public health experts are all of one mind, the public should be informed of that, as well. And if the experts largely agree, but the politicians make a different decision, they should tell us why. After all, the buck stops with our elected leaders. They are the ones who are accountable.National PostVivek Goel is a professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health.
