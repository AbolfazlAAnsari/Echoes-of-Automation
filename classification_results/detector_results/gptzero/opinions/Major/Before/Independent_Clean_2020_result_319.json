For instance, India is funding projects to launch rockets into space while having severe problems feeding and caring for its people. India is a recipient of huge aid support from many countries. While other countries have human rights issues and yet still receive aid.However, most aid recipients would suffer greatly if aid were to be withdrawn and it is incumbent on those countries who can afford aid to consistently help those countries in dire need. I and many others have criticised our government for the cynical caring ethos it shows.A reduction of a significant amount of aid will result in many people needlessly suffering the withdrawal of health programmes, education programmes, refugee aid, etc. With the vast amounts of borrowing Mr Sunak has actioned, it seems criminally churlish to take money away from those who most desperately need support. It’s sad to read that yet another minister,Baroness Sugg,has resigned in protest over the reduction of the aid budget. When organisations perform a U-turn it generally means that the initial decision had been given scant consideration or was a knee-jerk reaction to a major concern.It appears that Mr Sunak, after a stellar first few months in office, has finally succumbed to Mr Johnson’s affliction – nincompoopery. It’s just as well that this financial review is for only one year as we can’t be sure who will be in office next year with so many sadly resigning in the wake of incompetent government.Keith PooleBasingstokeTaking careJust getting my head around thejoint advice from the political leadersof our four nations.
