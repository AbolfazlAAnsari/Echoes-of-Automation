The platforms of the two leading parties were almost identical as they announced their plans for large deficits, growth of government and progressive social policies. There was no party that offered voters alternative legislative agendas.In the 1990s, Preston Manning and his Reform Party offered such an alternative. It was widely denounced as a populist movement threatening economic and social turmoil. However, in the 1993 election this party won 52 seats in the House of Commons and became the de facto opposition in Parliament.The cause of this electoral success is found in the party's platform that, according to the dictionary definition(https://www.google.com/search?q=populist+meaning&;oq=&;aqs=chrome.1.69i59i450l8.2021997215j0j15&;sourceid=chrome&;ie=UTF-8) of populism, \"appeals to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups.\"Populist parties typically promise legislation that covers a range of contentious issues. The Reform Party advocated downsizing government, tax cuts, the use of public referenda, and changes to official language policies, the criminal justice system, immigration, and other areas. However, as a candidate for office under the Reform banner during the 1993 election campaign I knocked on many doors and learned that ordinary people supported the party mainly because of its plan to eliminate the deficit - \"zero in three\" - and the smaller government and the tax cuts it would allow.After I won my riding, I had numerous conversations with Liberal MPs who told me they knew they had to deal with the concerns of ordinary people about deficits and the size of government if they wanted to prevent losing to the Reform Party in future elections.Led by prime minister Jean ChrÃ©tien and finance minister Paul Martin, starting with the 1995 budget, the government met these concerns by eliminating the deficit, shrinking civil service employment, and stalling the expansion of progressive social policies. These measures provided the basis for many years of economic growth, social stability, and the election of two Liberal governments.The Conservative party similarly adopted the key policies in the Reform Party platform and after some time merged with it. Under the leadership of Stephen Harper, the new Conservative party won the election in 2006 and was in office for the next nine years.Justin Trudeau's election in 2015 brought back large fiscal deficits, government growth and a sharp left turn in economic and social policies. The Conservative party led by Erin O'Toole appears to nearly mirror the Liberals' agenda, which I believe has increased considerably the army of concerned Canadians who are ready to support a populist party.
