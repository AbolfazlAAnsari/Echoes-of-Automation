To do less would demonstrate our lack of humanity.Ken ShuttleworthSt AlbansJury ruleAlastair Campbell’s thoughts about the personalities of Boris Johnson and Donald Trump ('On Covid and Brexit, reality is catching up with Boris Johnson’s fantasies and self-obsession’, 20 December) kindled in me again the idea that the sorts of people who rise to the top are so often just the sort of people who should never have power, since their ambition is driven by their need for recognition and glory rather than frustration or anger at the injustices and imperfections in the world around them.I sometimes wonder whether something like the jury system, selecting people at random to run something or other for five years or so whether they want to or not, would be worth trying. We would need to be very unlucky for them to be less competent than our last two or three prime ministers.Dennis LeachmanKingston upon ThamesCrash landingWhich sporting hero is the source of inspiration for our increasingly bewildered leader? Maybe he sees himself as Ian Botham smashing his way to victory against the odds or Bobby Moore inspiring his team to our nation's finest footballing hour or even the skilful Lewis Hamilton anticipating every high speed corner and always choosing the right line. All supremely talented in their chosen field.Unfortunately a moment’s thought soon identifies the true inspiration for Boris: Eddie the Eagle. Time and again he shambles to the top of the ski jump, ignores calls to think again, sets off on a reckless descent from which he cannot deviate and lands in an undignified, spluttering heap.John DillonNorthfield, BirminghamRead MoreBoris Johnson must now ask EU for an extension to Brexit negotiationsChristmas isn’t ‘cancelled’, we need strong leadership to remind usInternet trolls are a ghastly and should be called out"
