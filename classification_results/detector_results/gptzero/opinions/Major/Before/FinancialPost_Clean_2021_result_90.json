However, the Competition Bureau's successful case against the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) provides hope that even with the weak tools we currently have, the Competition Bureau can still take some action to address anti-competitive behaviours.In its assessment of the case, the Competition Tribunal found that TREB abused its dominant position by prohibiting real estate agents from publishing sales data online, among other restrictions on the use of its data. The tribunal found that the main intention of these restrictions was to protect its members from \"disruptive competition\" in the form of online services that make home sales and pricing data available.The case is important because TREB's use of its data to stifle innovation in the market was seen as a threat to economic efficiency. In this case, our obsession with efficiency played out in favour of home buyers in Toronto, as the prices of sold homes must now be made public, which introduces more transparency into the marketplace.This case shows that Canadian competition authorities do not necessarily view a firm's data as proprietary, which could have important implications in the digital sphere, including in the areas of portability and interoperability.The growing enthusiasm for a review of the Competition Act is not merely motivated by the ambition for Canadian authorities to mirror existing cases against Amazon, Google or Facebook. Indeed, Canada may not need to mimic these cases in order to benefit from their spillover effects.Rather, we need our policy toolkit to promote the responsible governance of digital firms of all sizes and protect consumers from anti-competitive behaviours. As it stands, privileging economic efficiency and tolerating meagre amounts of competition is a weird and outdated strategy that reinforces the dominance of Big Tech, instead of questioning it.National PostVass Bednar is the executive director of McMaster University's master of public policy in digital society program.
