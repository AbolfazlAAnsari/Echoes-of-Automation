Rather than allowing their terror to go unpunished, the global community should clearly condemn it, signalling a warning to other authoritarian regimes tempted to employ such criminal tactics.Condemning and punishing terrorism reinforces a stronger rules-based order and a more secure global community. Standing idle and reticent in the face of terrorism merely encourages it. Such collective silence is to our collective shame. It is time for Canada and other democratic countries to follow up strong rhetoric with matching action by labelling the Russian army and the IRGC for what they so plainly are: terrorist organizations.Special to National PostMarcus Kolga and Kaveh Shahrooz are Senior Fellows at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
