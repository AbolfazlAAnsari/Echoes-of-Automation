The go-to phrase \"schools should be the last to close and the first to open\" has been repeatedly uttered by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, Education Minister Stephen Lecce, Toronto Medical Officer of Health Eileen de Villa and others since the province's schools closed in April. How quickly children have been forgotten. Last Thursday, Ford sent a group of medical and educational professionals on a make-work project to state their cases for or against school reopenings in what was believed to be an effort to arrive at a consensus position. It turns out that simultaneously, the Conservative government was seeking public opinion as well; this time, pitting schools against industries with a misleading survey asking citizens if it is really worth it to reopen schools when an increase in cases might then result in a delay in the reopening of industries.The Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table has held strong in its projections that school reopenings will result in an increase in new daily cases of six to 11 per cent. Despite repeated outside efforts to obtain this modelling and the assumptions that went into it however, the Science Table has failed to release its data. Where are its projections around the expected increase in cases with the reopening of industries? Where is the Conservative government with a survey asking citizens if a potential increase in new daily cases with the reopening of industries is worth it at the cost of our children's health and well-being?Chris Selley: With salvation in sight, Ontario approaches peak COVID incoherence(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/chris-selley-with-salvation-in-sight-ontario-approaches-peak-covid-incoherence)Randall Denley: The harm of keeping schools closed is the only risk Doug Ford will tolerate(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/randall-denley-the-harm-of-keeping-schools-closed-is-the-only-risk-doug-ford-will-tolerate)The complacency of parents is now palpable. Maybe it's not worth it to reopen schools in June? What learning actually happens in the final month of school? The devastating reality is that many children attend school to be fed, to feel secure, to be supported. Reporting of abuse and neglect is down not because families are doing well, but because schools are closed and the majority of reporting occurs with in-person school. Meanwhile, we know that families are not OK. Domestic violence is on the rise and families are stressed financially. Children are disappearing from the education system and no one is watching. No one is caring. No one is trying to track down these children and account for their whereabouts. Parents say we have summer camps and school in September to look forward to. But what if the goalposts continue to move and schools do not reopen to in-person learning in September?At this time, parents need to be asking what guarantees we have for September. The education unions continue to ask for improved ventilation and small class sizes; the same requests they have had for years without change. Can we honestly expect a rehaul of our schools in time for September? The current levels of community transmission are low and our seven-day average is below 1,000, which was the initial marker for reopening. Our hospitals continue to empty and admissions with COVID-19 continue to decline. Our rates for first vaccination have now exceeded 70 per cent of eligible Ontarians, and all adults over the age of 18 are now eligible for vaccination. We will continue to see the introduction of new variants of concern, which consistently demonstrate greater transmissibility but have never been shown to be more virulent. We have obtained consensus from the medical community and our education unions have supported at least a regional approach to reopening at the discretion of local medical officers of health who in turn have vocalized their support. What more will it take to reopen schools? What will the magic bullet be in September or will the goalposts continue to move?There is a real sadness around Thursday's announcement. In the words of Nelson Mandela - the future lies in the hands of our children. But what will their future look like? Our government had the chance to reopen schools as a first step on the road to recovery. Without a clear plan for in-person learning in September, we may well be in this very position again for the next academic year. It is time to demand concrete answers from our government. It is time to put our children first.Alanna Golden is a practicing primary care physician in Toronto, a former social worker in children's mental health, and the mother of three young children.
