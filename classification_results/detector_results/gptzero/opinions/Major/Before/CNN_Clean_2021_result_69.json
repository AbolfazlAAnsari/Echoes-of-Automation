In his first inaugural address, hedeclared:\"This nation asks for action, and action now.\" He hoped to work in coordination with Congress, but if that legislative body failed to act, he would ask for \"broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.\"Biden and his team have hewn closely to this Roosevelt strategy in their first two weeks. In his inaugural address, Bidendeclaredthat the many crises facing the United States required \"a time for boldness.\" The administration'scallfor a \"big, bold package\" to address Covid-19 relief, viewing the risk as \"not going too big, it is going too small.\" Following the President's lead, Democrats in Congressare preparedto proceed without Republican support if necessary.During Roosevelt's first 100 days, theDemocratically-controlledUS House of Representatives and US Senatepassednumerous aspects of the proposed New Deal legislation, designed to lessen the economic impact of the Depression on millions of Americans. Among the first of these was theEmergency Banking Act, passed on March 9, just five days after Roosevelt's inauguration, which submitted banks to federal inspection and removed the US from the gold standard. Otherlegislative efforts, such as National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), which aimed to stabilize prices, increase wages and ensure collective bargaining, were hallmarks of this first congressional session.But Roosevelt also utilized executive orders to augment key components of his New Deal program. Citing the Emergency Banking Act, heorderedprivate supplies of gold to be given over to increase the government's reserves. Building upon the NIRA, hecreatedthe Civil Works Administration -- a jobs program that aimed to add about 4 million government jobs -- and following subsequent emergency relief, heestablishedthe Works Progress Administration in 1935 that similarly set forth to create public works jobs. Roosevelt alsolaunchedthe Rural Electrification Administration that helped bring electricity to rural areas across the country.In the same way, many of Biden's executive orders address economic concerns that require immediate action. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, he has called for assistance to those whoare strugglingto buy food, pay rent and make student loan payments. Similarly, his planto raisethe minimum wage for federal workers to $15 and restore collective bargaining power rightechoesRoosevelt's own commitments.Roosevelt's executive orders during wartime likewise aimed to meet the emergency of effective resource allocation. By executive order, Rooseveltestablishedthe War Production Board in 1942 for \"assuring the most effective prosecution of war procurement and production.\" The board stayed in effect until the end of the war in 1945, when itwas replacedby the Civilian Production Administration.The complexities of Covid-19 testing and vaccine distribution demand a similar response from the federal government today. Bidenhas establisheda Covid-19 pandemic testing board to widen the capacity of coronavirus testing. He has further directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)to expandfederal dollars for expenses pertaining to the National Guard's role in scaling up vaccination.Nevertheless, executive action can prove terribly misguided. Roosevelt's infamous Executive Order 9066createdmilitary areas for the internment of certain designated Americans, which in practice predominantly targeted Japanese Americans. Despite legal challenges to the order, the US Supreme Courtupheldthe legality of the camps twice.Later presidents took executive action to provide restitution to internment victims, until in 1988, Congress passed the Civil Liberties Act to provide reparations totaling $1.6 billion. Fittingly, Biden's recent executive order to address racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the US furthers equity among many of these same groups.Overall, then, executive action worked best for Roosevelt when in tandem with the efforts of Congress. Following Roosevelt's lead, Biden has appropriately begun to utilize the many tools at his disposal, executive orders among them, to combat a pandemic that hasalready takenmore lives than all the American combat casualties in World War II. At the same time, Biden hassignaledhis intention to work closely with congressional leaders from both parties, even as he hasalready begunto wind down his use of executive orders to focus on the pending Covid relief bill. But thus far his executive orders have been unaided by congressional legislation.The critical question remaining is this: will Congress -- as it has done before during times of crisis -- fulfill its responsibility to legislate?Opinion by Thomas BalcerskiTM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
