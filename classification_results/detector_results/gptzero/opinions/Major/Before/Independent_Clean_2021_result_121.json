The inconsistency of similar \"discretion\" during lockdown does not hold out much hope of public understanding or cooperation.I find Humza Yousaf's claim of \"strong safeguards\" is far from reassuring. Convictions may be unlikely but the idea of the police entering one's home to investigate a disgruntled child's \"tip-off\" about dinner table conversation is deplored across the political spectrum.Rev Dr John CameronSt AndrewsPatient backlogsWith both NHS leaders and healthcare professionals highlighting new concern over the backlog ofelective care procedurescaused by the pandemic, NHS Providers' chief executive Chris Hopson has rightly called for a \"bold transformative approach\" to how the NHS provides care.But how bold, and how transformative, are NHS leaders willing to be?Time and again, the narrative falls back to the need to \"add\" capacity - be that workforce or beds. Yet, there is evidence of inherent, latent capacity within existing healthcare systems and that by improving patient flow throughout, a hospital can unlock at least one ward of additional capacity per district general hospital in the NHS.If the NHS could better optimise existing capacity, just consider the implications for patients, for Emergency Departments (ED), operational costs and, of course, staff morale.As the daily struggle to balance demand and capacity in hospitals was magnified by the Covid-19 pandemic, managing this as efficiently as possible will be key to addressing the pent-up backlog. With the NHS waiting list at a 14-year record high of 4.7 million people, there must be a clear call-to-action followed by a swift sense of delivery to better support both patient outcomes and the wellbeing of frontline staff.Now is the time for the NHS to truly embrace, scale and sustain opportunities for innovation; to change hospital bed utilisation models that have remained largely unchanged for decades. It is time to adopt, implement and invest in proven solutions that support capacity planning and patient flow efficiencies. We do not need more capacity; we just need to use the capacity we have better.Neil Griffiths, managing director, TeleTracking UKLondonRead MoreBoris Johnson vows to end protocol's 'ludicrous trade barriers'It is heartbreaking to watch the demise of footballJohnson's career after politics will be impacted by lobbying inquiry"
