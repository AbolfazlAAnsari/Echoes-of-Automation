Please send your letters toletters@independent.co.ukThe Queen has apparentlybanned Monopoly at Christmasas it causes \"too many arguments\" and even becomes \"vicious\".Well, it does look rather as if theroyal familyis in some ways the same as every other family, after all. So, this year, will they have children unhappy with the number and quality of presents? Will they have someone who talks too much? Will they have the annoying uncle who says the wrong things? Will they all fall asleep at 3pm after too much food and wine?Banning Monopoly will certainly help, as would banning Twister, Battleships, especially if they use real ones from their fleet, truth or dare, and even pin the tail on the royal butler.Dennis FitzgeraldMelbourne, AustraliaOur obsession with conservatismI agree with pretty much every word in Ryan Coogan's article about the zombie, vomit-eating dog that is conservatism ('Conservatism has wrecked this country - just as it was designed to', Voices, 7 December). And yet I can't help but be reminded of how the Conservative Party is the most successful in history, if success is measured by longevity, and feel that yet another Houdini act is to follow in which that party goes on, even if many more of us do not. It remains in our collective hands, however, to change this, if only we wanted to keep the chocolate away from the dog.Ian HendersonNorwichIt's one way to keep fitI note that there is research indicating that taking Viagra reduces the likelihood of suffering from Alzheimers's disease. Could there be a confounding factor? All that exercise after taking the tablets may be beneficial in itself.Cole DavisNorwichBe careful what you wish forIt is ironic that the prime minister wishes to abolish the court's ability to conduct judicial reviews in the name of reinforcing the sovereignty of parliament ('Boris Johnson \"planning reforms which would let ministers overrule judicial decisions\"', 6 December). Boris Johnson's desire to prorogue parliament, if you remember, was to precisely thwart the sovereignty of that very same parliament. The courts defended the sovereignty of parliament by ruling that it was illegal, of course.The new proposals seem to give ministers the right to ignore any decision of the courts they do not like. The government is not parliament. It is the first act of potential dictators and tyrants to wish to have political control of the courts. This should be resisted by all true parliamentarians.No doubt there will be some who wish to support this initiative but they should consider that, though they may have confidence in this prime minister's intentions, would they approve of similar powers in the hands of, say, Jeremy Corbyn?C C ElshawHeadleyChristmas appeal: Skill Up Step UpCongratulations on supporting youth skills with yourChristmas appeal, \"Skill Up Step Up\".  I am totally behind you and hope you raise lots of money. Can we also make sure that these young people learn to do the things we need doing? I have in mind for example building sustainable homes, retrofitting existing homes and fitting electric boilers.Jane PensonChalfont St GilesWhat an inspiring story about Devonte ('Skill Up Step Up: The remarkable story of Devonte, from school dropout to the O2', 6 November). It just shows what you can achieve with determination. How wonderful too that an employer gave him a chance. I hope he goes on to realise his dreams, he deserves it.Diane GrahamWatfordBursting the London bubbleI feel compelled to defend people \"living in the London bubble\", assuming that simply means people living in London ('Thousands of homes up north are still without power - where's the outrage?',Letters, 5 December). I feel that Londoners - not a homogeneous group politically or culturally - are unfairly being conflated with all journalists (who are themselves not homogeneous).Many of us do care. Of course we do. How could we not? The lack of power in people's homes for so long is indefensible and unimaginable, particularly at this time of year. Northern Powergrid must be called to account. Ofgem must be called to account. The government must be called to account. And, yes, perhaps there should be more press coverage. (Radio 4 has covered it extensively, including moving interviews with some of those affected.)Beryl WallLondon W4Read MoreLetters: It is difficult not to question every decision the government makesLetters: If Boris Johnson goes, will we finally get a Tory leader who cares?Letters: Thousands of homes up north are still without power - where's the outrage?Letters: It is difficult not to question every decision the government makesLetters: If Boris Johnson goes, will we finally get a Tory leader who cares?Letters: Thousands of homes up north are still without power - where's the outrage?"
