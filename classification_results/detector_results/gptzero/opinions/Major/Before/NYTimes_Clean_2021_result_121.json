            "inputText": "Readers discuss a conservative movement within the Catholic Church. Also: A doctor&#39;s family in the pandemic.To the Editor:Re “Pope Francis Is Tearing the Catholic Church Apart,” by Michael Brendan Dougherty (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Aug. 12):Pope Francis is not destroying the Catholic Church. A group rebelling against Francis has seized on the Latin Mass as its symbol.The problem with the Latin Mass is that it is inherently sexist. Additionally, the priest stands with his back to the congregation, mumbling in a dead language few understand. The choir in the loft sings in the same dead language. And the congregation occupies itself however it chooses, often with an unrelated set of prayers.The church moved forward more than 50 years ago. The laggards need to join the main body of the church.Lisa WeberRosalia, Wash.To the Editor:Although the plaintive whining of Michael Brendan Dougherty includes certain truths about the beauty and the cultural place of the Latin liturgy in centuries of Western art and worship, this baby boomer — who still knows his Latin responses — couldn’t disagree more that Pope Francis is destroying the church.One need not agree with all of Francis’ reforms or ecclesiastical priorities and changes to recognize that he is calling all humanity — not just the Catholic Church — to a deeper awareness of a shared love and critical commitment to the beauty of creation and the absolute necessity of reordering our priorities to preserve human life on this planet.The book of creation is the first incarnation of God in the world, and Francis admonishes all to recognize this.Don’t get so myopic and please desist the liturgical wars, Mr. Dougherty, and commit yourself and your fellow worshipers to the values celebrated in the encyclical “Laudato Si” and to the absolute necessity of working toward preserving this beautiful planet for all of God’s creation.Dave PasinskiFayetteville, N.Y.The writer is a former Catholic priest.To the Editor:There has been a Latin Mass group worshiping now in its fourth church in Jersey City, N.J., for over two decades. Most of them do not live in the area or even the state.They promise to raise money for the church and do not. They bring in so many outdated vessels, vestments and statuary to dress up the sanctuary akin to a museum mounting. And that’s the ambience they convey: The church has moved on, but they want “their” own church.But conserving externals is only part of their problem. They divide the local community by asking for more desirable time slots and do not integrate into the community. And their ecclesiology is not only anti-Francis but also unreal.The church has moved on to a more inclusive, communal experience; they have not. Pope Francis’ move to limit its use was needed to jolt them from their fantasies. Come back to earth. Heaven can wait.Alexander M. SantoraHoboken, N.J.The writer is pastor of the Church of Our Lady of Grace and St. Joseph in Hoboken, N.J., and dean of the area’s Catholics.To the Editor:Devotees of the old Latin Mass act as if its celebration goes back to Jesus Christ Himself. In fact, it was a product of the 16th-century Council of Trent. As a response to the Protestant Reformation, its purpose was to standardize liturgical practice and affirm exactly how Roman Catholics were to worship.During the mid-19th and early 20th centuries, much academic research was being carried out to determine how the earliest Christians worshiped. The Mass that emerged from Vatican II was the product of that scholarship.Thus, it was not, as Michael Brendan Dougherty states, “the worst spasm of iconoclasm in the church’s history.” In fact, it was a restoration.Pope Francis is not tearing the Catholic Church apart. He is reaffirming the authenticity of the current rite and trying to bridge divisions that have arisen because some are nostalgic for a 500-year-old relic.Marion EagenClarks Green, Pa.A Doctor’s Family: We Live and Breathe ‘Covid Thoughts’To the Editor:Re “Time Is Winding Down on Those Pandemic Pods” (Thursday Styles, Aug. 12):These pandemic pods you interviewed were lucky to have one another. But for many of us, our experience could not have been more different.For many medical families, such as mine, there have been no pandemic pods. In the beginning, we — my husband, an emergency medicine physician, and I — questioned whether he should sleep separately so as to not risk exposing me, on immunosuppressive medication, or our children.We so feared whether we might spread the virus, even asymptomatically, to others that for many months no one entered our home, save a few short (masked) visits with my father. I didn’t see my mother, on hospice in an assisted living facility, for six months until we were both fully vaccinated.It has been an emotionally isolating experience, as well: Those outside of medicine have no idea what families like ours experience, that we live and breathe “Covid thoughts” from morning to night. There are never any carefree “game nights, UberEats banquets” or road trips. There is no option of taking time off to recharge, or even to catch up on sleep. The work continues.To those with the privilege of a circle of loved ones around them to weather this mess: Cherish them. I am glad you have been supported. But lest we wax too philosophically about the social groups that sustained us through the pandemic, let’s make sure we’re really out of it first.As we contemplate the next steps before us, there is only one thing that matters. Get your damn shot. If you’ve had yours, thank you. Now please go help two more people get theirs. I can’t think of a better way to bring back the promise of intimacy with our friends and family.Anna StoetzerSeattlePHOTO:    (PHOTOGRAPH BY Daniel Stolle FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
