An11-year-old in Marylandwas disciplined for wearing leggings. An8th grader in Georgiawas cited for a rip in her jeans. InNorth Carolina, a sophomore was penalized over beads in her traditional African hairstyle. InMichigan, a Catholic high school threatened students with a \"modesty poncho.\"In most cases, girls lost precious class time over spaghetti straps, yoga pants, hair extensions and even the size of their breasts -- because, to quote one teacher, \"smallerbusted womencould get away with more than larger busted women.\" Black girls are the most frequently targeted group when it comes to violations, according to social justice scholar and authorMonique Morris.Repeatedly, school officials define girls' bodies as offensive, sexy, provoking, problematic and inappropriate. Exposed thighs and collarbones, too-large breasts, Black hair, too-wide hips and a too-big butt, along with other mundane body parts are sexualized and weaponized.How will girls gain the right for body autonomy as women, if their bodies are being objectified and devalued by the institutions they are told to trust? How will they develop the capacity to fight back? Schools are but a microcosm of the control they will face, as adult women, from lawmakers, government agencies, religious groups, even healthcare providers.\"Objectification creates a hierarchy in which objectified bodies are less human, less valued and less privileged than others,\" argues Rouhollah Aghasaleh, a Humboldt State University professor and author of the article \"Oppressive Curriculum: Sexist, Racist, Classist, and Homophobic Practice of Dress Codes in Schooling.\"Dress codes, writes Aghasaleh, \"convey sexism with a male centered gaze and racism with White middle-class norms that serve as a hidden curriculum...\" They also play a role in victim blaming and rape culture, he adds.A2020 studyby University of Wisconsin professor Gretchen Whitman further links the process of objectification in schools to the erosion of women's rights.Sexist dress codes, she writes, treat girls \"like objects while males are assumed to be incapable of controlling their sexual desires.\" She concludes, \"As part of the hidden curriculum in schools, dress codes serve to perpetuate oppression of females and minorities, thereby promoting the hegemony of the white male.\"As we witness the beginning of a new era in the policing and politicizing of women's bodies, and as protests against both are happening across the country, young people are demanding the right for bodily autonomy in their own communities by transforming the very schools they attend.Adopting agender-neutral dress codecan be one powerful tool in the fight for equity and freedom. Such inclusive dress codes also ban clothing with racist or LGBTQ-phobic messaging to create a safe environment, one where students can use clothing as a means of self-expression. Even gender-neutral uniforms have thecapacity to diminisheconomic and social barriers between students -- as was my experience attending a private school where many of my classmates came from wealthy families, while my family was of moderate means.Students leading this charge have seen gainsworking with national organizations,or byfounding their ownto reform school policies pertaining to students' self-presentation -- such as the stigmatization of afro hair and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The National Youth Rights Association (NYRA) the ACLU and Lambda Legal guide young changemakers in advocating for reforms.It is not enough for young people to yell in protest and post about their anguish on social media. It is steady, quiet work that gradually dismantles oppressive systems and rebuilds a more just society.Looking back to that high school incident, I wish I'd had the courage and resources to speak out against my teacher's intrusion and the gendered uniforms we were forced to wear -- a job I have now entrusted to the characters in my novel and the teens I meet during author school visits.These young people embody the words of Latina activist and icon, Dolores Huerta: \"Every moment is an organizing opportunity, every person a potential activist, every minute a chance to change the world.\"Opinion by Mayra CuevasTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
