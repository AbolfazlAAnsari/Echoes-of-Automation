Charles carried his parachute across Yugoslavia so Mary Alice could use it as material for her wedding dress.Their letters were interrupted twice. The first time, dad and his crew bailed out over Romania but returned in just over a week. The second time, they bailed out over Yugoslavia. He was picked up by the Partisan underground but remained missing for two months. His adventures in Yugoslavia would become the basis of my upcoming book, \"Lost Airmen.\"Dad carried his parachute all the way across Yugoslavia so that Mary Alice, my mother, could use it as material for her wedding dress. He later claimed that she was disappointed he didn't bring the parachute back the first time he was shot down, so he had to bail out again a second time to get another one.They married on Oct. 27, 1945. The story of the parachute wedding dress was picked up by news wire services and was published in newspapers all over the Northeast. My parents were married for 30 years, and had five children, 13 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.Charles E. Stanley Jr. writes of his parents’ romance and his father’s harrowing escape from the Nazis in \"Lost Airmen: The Epic Rescue of WWII U.S. Bomber Crews Stranded Behind Enemy Lines\"(Regnery History; March 15, 2022)."
