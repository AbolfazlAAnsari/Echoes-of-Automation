It handed down prison sentences(https://iranhumanrights.org/2020/02/iran-should-free-conservationists-jailed-on-charges-trumped-up-charges/) totalling 58 years for eight of the country's most prominent environmental scientists, all of whom are members of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation (PWHF).The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) arrested the PWHF members after countrywide protests in 2018, which were sparked(https://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-iran-protests-climate-change-2018-story.html) by the government's mismanagement of another public health crisis - an unprecedented water shortage. The IRGC went on to arrest the eight environmentalists and detain the(https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/24/iran-charges-five-wildlife-activists-capital-offences-spying?CMP=share_btn_tw) deputy head of Iran's Department of Environment, along with water conservation expert Kaveh Madani, who was held for 72 hours and then fled the country. A ninth PWHF member, Kavous Seyed-Emami, died two weeks after(https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2018/02/iranian-canadian-academic-dies-in-custody-while-under-interrogations/) his arrest, while being interrogated. The authorities insisted that he died by \"suicide,\" but evidence showing an(https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2019/02/family-of-late-conservationist-kavous-seyed-emami-petitions-iran-to-respond-to-state-tv-smears-ramin/) injection and bruising on his body suggests otherwise.The authorities took advantage of Seyed-Emami's death to force the other environmentalists to sign confessions. One of them, Niloufar Bayani, a former United Nations environment consultant and graduate of McGill University, sent repeated letters(https://iranhumanrights.org/2020/02/conservationist-niloufar-bayani-iran-torture-and-sexual-threats-detailed-in-letters-by-jailed-former-un-environment-consultant/) to the authorities, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, describing her torture in graphic detail. In a recent letter, she wrote that interrogators showed her a photograph of Seyed-Emami's corpse and warned that she, her colleagues and family members would suffer a similar fate, \"unless you write whatever we want.\"An Iranian woman wearing a protective face mask chooses traditional items ahead of Nowruz, the national New Year celebration, at the Tajrish Bazaar in Tehran on March 19.Iran is now facing another public health emergency and cannot hide its magnitude in the same way it did with its environmental crisis. In just over a month, the cornavirus has spread to every province and the numbers have skyrocketed to more than 23,000 confirmed cases and 1,812 fatalities, according to official figures (though many experts have suggested(https://iranhumanrights.org/2020/02/coronavirus-in-iran-health-experts-question-officially-reported-infection-numbers/) that the numbers are much higher). And yet, no quarantines have been put in place.Instead, the Islamic republic is covering up the gravity of the situation and deflecting responsibility.

Iran's state-run media has also been advancing the conspiracy theory that the virus is an American-engineered bioweapon(https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/02/04/617877/Is-the-coronavirus-a-US-bioweapon) and that \"Zionist elements\" have targeted Iran(https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/03/05/620217/US-coronavirus-James-Henry-Fetzer) with a particularly deadly strain.Firefighters wear protective face masks, as they disinfect the streets, ahead of the Iranian New Year, in Tehran on March 18.The environmentalists are being blamed for the pandemic, as well. IRGC-backed Twitter accounts have linked the PWHF to the virus and bioterrorism, while Tehran's prosecutor general, Abbas Jafari Dowlatabadi, spread false claims(https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2018/03/environmentalists-detained-in-crackdown-denied-legal-counsel-amid-claims-some-were-jewish-spies/?utm_content=buffer08029&;utm_medium=social&;utm_source=twitter.com&;utm_campaign=buffer) that they were part of a \"joint CIA-Mossad project to create crises in certain environmental areas.\" In reality, the environmentalists were declared innocent(https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2019/02/mounting-evidence-that-clears-eight-conservationists-from-grave-charges-judiciary-still-relies-on-forced-confessions/) by numerous Iranian officials, including the head of the Department of Environment and the minister of intelligence.In both cases, the IRGC pointed to scapegoats instead of offering empirical solutions to address these national emergencies.Most of the environmentalists, along with many other political prisoners, are being held in Iran's Evin Prison, where at least five inmates have(https://iranhumanrights.org/2020/03/political-prisoners-excluded-from-mass-release-as-more-inmates-exhibit-covid-19-symptoms/) contracted the virus. The overcrowded wards in Evin have now run out of(https://iranhumanrights.org/2020/02/grave-concerns-for-prisoners-in-iran-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/) medical, sanitary and hygienic supplies. Last week, the environmentalist with the shortest prison sentence of four years, Abdolreza Kouhpayeh, was included in a reported mass pardon in an apparent effort to curb the outbreak, although only prisoners with less than five-year sentences were eligible.In recent weeks, the UN Environment Programme reiterated its call for the release of the PWHF members, and a UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran demanded the temporary release(https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-rights-iran/u-n-urges-iran-to-free-political-prisoners-temporarily-amid-coronavirus-idUSKBN20X1YV) of all Iranian political prisoners.

It has proven that what happens abroad, particularly in authoritarian countries, matters at home. We will only be able to overcome these challenges with transparent governments that respect the rights of their citizens, instead of stoking enmity and suppressing information and science. The Islamic republic can start by releasing the scientists who dedicate their lives to preventing these crises and preserving our planet.National PostAna Diamond is the co-founder of the Alliance Against State Hostage Taking.
