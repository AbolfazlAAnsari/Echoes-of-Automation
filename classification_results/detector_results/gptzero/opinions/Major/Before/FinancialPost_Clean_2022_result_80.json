Having sustained much collateral damage from COVID policies, children's mental, physical, and academic well-being will need to be a major focus of governments moving forward.Despite narratives to the contrary, COVID was never a major threat to children, and the very small threat that was present early in the pandemic has shrunk considerably with the arrival of the Omicron(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2790793)variant. Most children have mild or no symptoms(https://www.mcri.edu.au/images/documents/migrate/covid-19-and-child-and-adolescent-health-140921.pdf), similar to a cold. And recently, Dr. Caroline Quach-Thanh(https://montreal.citynews.ca/2022/08/24/more-cases-with-back-to-school/), a pediatrician and chair of Quebec's immunization committee, acknowledged that the severity of COVID in children is less than influenza. While the death of a child is always tragic, children are extremely unlikely to die from COVID, with British data(https://alasdairmunro.substack.com/p/children-are-really-really-unlikely) showing a risk as low as 1 in 500,000 for healthy children. Finally, given that COVID is incidentally found in children hospitalized for other reasons, many pediatric hospitalization(https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/38/E1483) and death(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01578-1) figures are overestimates, especially in the era of Omicron.(https://www.healthdata.org/news-events/blogs/covid-19-insights-blog)Early concerns about long COVID in children have also remained unfounded(https://journals.lww.com/pidj/fulltext/2022/05000/the_challenge_of_studying_long_covid__an_updated.16.aspx), with many of the reported symptoms being as common in children with COVID as those children who were never infected. And the small minority who do develop persistent symptoms after COVID - such as cough or loss of smell or taste - get better over time(https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext#:~:text=1734%20children%20(588%20younger%20and,0%25%5D%20of%201734%20children). ). Fortunately, more severe complications of COVID such as chronic fatigue syndrome, cognitive difficulties including brain fog and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath after exercise, are very uncommon(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00431-021-04345-z?fbclid=IwAR1gCLtOjOgs40Sjs6nbIumV0o2915gRXQsu9ciQEPfA8HdfC1wxaZsOylU) in children. Such complications are also not restricted to COVID, because they can rarely occur after many other viral and other infections.Importantly, too, larger studies(https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(22)00022-0/fulltext) involving teenagers reporting their own symptoms have found no differences in mental health and wellbeing of those who tested positive compared to those who tested negative for the virus. Finally, the rates of the rare Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children(https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac553/6631205?fbclid=IwAR3vx0gKNQkHIm7BLpFDVYuvsnvqoXabfN3rjUStxMB_MJxc0SlU7Hk3jmM&;login=false#367610988) (MIS-C) have dropped precipitously since Omicron emerged.Despite the facts that children have a miniscule risk of severe disease, teachers(https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2060) are not at a higher risk than the general community, and schools are not primary drivers(https://www.who.int/laos/news/commentaries/detail/to-avert-a-learning-catastrophe-schools-must-stay-open-amidst-omicron-threat-and-beyond) of community transmission, governments from many parts of the world engaged in the \"moral catastrophe\"(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35857276/ )of extended school closures, causing significant damage to children's educational attainment, as well as their physical and psychological well-being. A recent Harvard(https://cepr.harvard.edu/files/cepr/files/5-4.pdf?m=1651690491) report of 49 American states describes large declines in math and reading achievements, especially among children from racialized and disadvantaged communities. And these studies don't even begin to capture the many children who have been lost to the school system,(https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-07-30/l-a-schools-says-20-000-students-are-missing-from-rosters) possibly forever. In sharp contrast, Sweden(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035522000891?fbclid=IwAR2P8gGQGhWbBOBm6uAzB-XoWYRkYoe3r5ZARnPpzEHRe4NLOSa7sGKz8kg#fig0001) kept schools open and has reported no learning loss, including in children from low socioeconomic backgrounds.Significant increases in obesity(https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/pop.2022.0030), type 2 diabetes(https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(22)00719-3/fulltext), and eating disorders(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2786919?fbclid=IwAR3MIfTNMGahlRfla5A0ch8T9PKF2szAo4Dg4oW-lOMPaHiu1fIAi1pPVqs) have coincided with pandemic policies. Children's mental health(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9420079/) has worsened with increased prevalence of anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and suicidal ideation. Finally, and as forewarned(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8114587/) by some experts, we have witnessed global examples of \"immunity debt\" which has led to higher than pre-pandemic infection rates with viruses such as RSV(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8598182/), and serious bacterial diseases including meningitis(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3998164) and pneumonia(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4026121).When children finally returned to in-person education, the environment was far from normal. Mask mandates, enforced cohorts, cancelled athletics, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions disrupted learning and socialization, making the experience of childhood less pleasant and productive. School masking carries potential harms(https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14034948221081087?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&;fbclid=IwAR1UlV8-mZrd1F5Yv0qfB5AF2z69X3rgK28N8wyxWN9rLCku3Dj9ABl_OLg&;) and lacks compelling evidence of benefit. Even Dr. Leanna Wen(https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/23/my-kids-wont-wear-masks-school/), a COVID hawk and a CNN medical contributor, is now advocating against school masking and has revealed that her own son's language development was harmed by masks. Studies from around the world, including from England(https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1055639/Evidence_summary_-_face_coverings.pdf), Finland(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.04.22272833v1), Spain(https://adc.bmj.com/content/early/2022/08/23/archdischild-2022-324172.info), and the United States(https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1773983/v1), have failed to find compelling evidence for school masking. This is not surprising given that most children use ineffective cloth masks(https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0074229?fbclid=IwAR0dHHTVDgveE97F-Glum6KpkGAuPpOWRE8qRnq-_Ly0U1JiQOoR-xPuc1E) and have poor compliance with proper mask use. Even the N95 mask, the highest quality mask available, is rendered mostly useless with typical gaps(https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0057100?fbclid=IwAR1LC8J7dFhkiv_GiQqOBP42rNdSH4MeAuO-u4plzkrTXAYkdeENmvdgy2E) around the cheeks and nose.Opinion: Draconian COVID measures were a mistake, let's not repeat them(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-draconian-covid-measures-were-a-mistake-lets-not-repeat-them)Opinion: Misuse of the term 'misinformation' has muzzled scientific COVID-19 debate(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-misuse-of-the-term-misinformation-has-muzzled-scientific-covid-19-debate)When considering pediatric COVID vaccination, we should refrain from mandates. As explained by others(https://gh.bmj.com/content/7/5/e008684), the harms related to mandates outweigh any potential benefits, especially because current vaccines have been much less effective at stopping or slowing(https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/apa.16430) infection and transmission since the Omicron variant emerged. The area in which vaccines excel - preventing severe disease - is rare in children. Bad outcomes are even less likely now that most children(https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#pediatric-seroprevalence) have already been infected at least once, because the immunity acquired after infection has been shown to be both robust(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01089-8)and durable(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2795690?guestAccessKey=9d515e08-5df1-4b6e-ab4a-9b947b1d429c&;utm_source=For_The_Media&;utm_medium=referral&;utm_campaign=ftm_links&;utm_content=tfl&;utm_term=082922), especially against severe disease. Denying children access to regular life (e.g. going to camp and playing sports) over interventions with such small benefits is not proportional. As NACI(https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/updated-recommendations-use-covid-19-vaccines-children-5-11-years-age.html) clearly states, we should respect the decisions that parents and children make.As the school year progresses, we should view our children not as vectors of disease but the future of our civilization. With widespread immunity, milder variants, and readily available vaccine boosters and therapeutics for those who need them most, we have now entered the endemic(https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2206573?fbclid=IwAR21DCGA0P6cNCk-m1fAsHWzuyuHuD6maNj3u9CHjBJB3DrFpKByM3J1Ccw) and less urgent phase of the COVID story. We must now ensure that we don't create a new pandemic, a pandemic of ill-being in our children.Dr. Jennifer Grant is an Infectious disease physician in Vancouver, Dr. Martha Fulford is an adult and pediatric infectious disease physician in Hamilton, Dr. Shamez Ladhani is a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at St. George's Hospital and a professor of pediatric infectious diseases and vaccinology at St. George's University of London, and Dr. Pooya Kazemi is an anesthesiologist in Victoria. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
