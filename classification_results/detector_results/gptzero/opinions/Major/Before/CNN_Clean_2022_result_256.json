Traditional office jobs, such as finance, information, legal, consulting, technology and public administration, best accommodate flexibility. For many parents, and mothers in particular, the ability to work from home or have flexible hours are deciding factors in whether to keep or leave a job.As a result, some employers are turning to more flexible job arrangements, including remote work, contracting and outsourcing, which is a great way to attract and retain talent. Other firms are lowering job requirements (not mandating college degrees, for example), offering training, and even hiring non-traditional workers like the disabled or formerly incarcerated persons.Indeed, our mid-yearC-Suite Outlook 2022 Surveyshows that across the globe, 56% of CEOs are already promoting their hybrid work models as a way to address the challenge of hiring quality candidates, while 25% are allowing fully remote working arrangements from anywhere in the world. And 24% are relying more on independent/contractual workers, another 24% are relaxing hiring criteria, and 7% are hiring previously incarcerated persons. All of these methods can help companies better manage the labor shortage.RespectMany people saw the quitting frenzy and the massive number of job openings as an opportunity to trade up into better working conditions and/or new titles. Others quit as a matter of principle. Some quit jobs due to vaccine mandates or because managers demanded they return to the office.While work-from-home has its advantages for both employers (e.g., cheaper labor from anywhere) and employees (e.g., savings on commuting times and costs), there are downsides, including the potential loss of productivity, the erosion of corporate culture, and lost opportunities for networking and training for workers.Still, some workers value the benefits of flexibility over retaining a job - especially with so many other openings available. Ultimately, companies will need to develop an approach - when, where and how work gets done - that's both competitive within their industries and delivers on the needs of management and employees.Withlabor shortagesunlikely to subside anytime soon, it's likely the quitting will also continue. Labor shortages are a huge problem in the US, which will only be exacerbated by an aging worker population, fewer people participating in the labor market post-pandemic, low birthrates and strict immigration laws. Slower economic growth ahead, as the Fed hikes interest rates, should lower job demand somewhat and ease quitting. Indeed, the rapid rise in quit rates may be starting to peak. But, as long as there is not enough labor and workers have options, they will try to find something better.Opinion by Dana Peterson for CNN Business PerspectivesTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
