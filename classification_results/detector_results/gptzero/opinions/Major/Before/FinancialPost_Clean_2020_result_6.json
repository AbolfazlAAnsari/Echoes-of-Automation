            "inputText": "In these pages last week,(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-what-the-rule-of-law-is-and-why-it-matters-for-everyone) we discussed the central importance of the rule of law and its implications for the pipeline protesters. Here, we focus on one specific aspect of the rule of law: the duty of government actors to enforce the law, in the present case by directing police forces to bring an end to railway blockades.Such blockades are clearly illegal. The protesters not only repeatedly interfered with the rights of others, they were and are also likely in breach of various statutes including the Criminal Code. The courts - which are independent of the government and impartial - ordered injunctions on the basis that irreparable harm would occur if the blockades were allowed to continue.Despite this, the police have often been reticent to enforce the injunction orders. In the face of this inaction, the government of Canada appealed to the principle of police independence. The prime minister put it succinctly a few days ago when he said, \"we are not the kind of country where politicians get to tell the police what to do in operational matters.\" In our view, however, this statement misunderstands the nature of police independence and the limits that the rule of law imposes upon executive discretion.A protester is led into a police van at a rail blockade in Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, near Belleville, Ont., on Feb. 24, 2020.Executive power has long been thought to be the greatest danger to the rule of law. While all three branches of the state - legislature, executive and judiciary - are capable of undermining legality, the executive can wield arbitrary power swiftly and without warning, with the entire might of the state at its disposal. For the most part, this takes the form of aggressive action that goes beyond what the law permits.But inaction can be just as threatening to the rule of law as over-action. An executive that chooses not to enforce the law acts in principle no differently from an executive that exceeds its legal authority. In both cases, the government ignores democratically enacted law and decides for itself what the rules ought to be. The rule of law requires the executive not only to stay within legal bounds, but also to faithfully enforce the laws Parliament or the provincial legislatures have enacted.The same goes for judicial decisions. The courts apply the law to individual cases, but they are powerless to enforce their own judgments. The administration of justice and indeed the entire lawful structure of the state depend upon the willingness of the executive, including the police, to respect and enforce court orders. Most people would understand this intuitively when it comes to punishing accused persons who have been found guilty and releasing those who have not, but it is no less true when it comes to executing court orders in civil cases, including injunctions.The principle of police independence means that law-enforcement agencies enjoy a certain level of operational autonomy and discretion, but it does not change the fact that, like the rest of the executive, they are bound to faithfully execute the law. The structure and powers of the police remain subject to the law - the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act (\"RCMPA\") in the case of the RCMP. Under the RCMPA, the government appoints and can remove the police commissioner, who remains under the direction of the minister of public safety.The Supreme Court of Canada has affirmed the principle of police independence in the context of \"criminal investigations.\" But having regard to the language of the RCMPA, the court expressly left open the possibility that the government could direct police in other matters. The court did not discuss what situations would give rise to ministerial control or oversight, but in our view, the enforcement of court orders and the law more generally must come within this ambit, especially when the normal functioning of critical national infrastructure is at stake.In the context of criminal investigations, police independence is required by the rule of law. It ensures that investigations do not become partisan witch hunts, and, conversely, that friends of the government are not protected from being arrested and charged. But where the enforcement of court orders and the law more generally is concerned, the rule of law cuts the other way. Concerns about partisan misuse of the state's coercive power are out of place when it comes to the enforcement of orders made by independent courts following a fair hearing, or generally of laws enacted by democratically elected representatives. In these and other contexts, the rule of law requires the oversight, not the independence, of the police.Supporters of Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs block the entrance to the Port of Vancouver at Hastings Street and Clark Drive on Feb. 24, 2020.To repeat, the police have discretion as to the particular investigations they will undertake or the specific arrests they will make. But they are duty-bound to uphold the law more generally. Should they refuse to do so, democratic governments must be able to rein them in and ensure that legislation and court orders are brought into effect. If, for example, the police commissioner refused, on some policy ground, to investigate any allegation of insider trading, the government would be entirely justified in directing that person to do so, and, failing that, removing him or her from office.Police independence can be compared in some respects to prosecutorial independence, which came into the limelight last year during the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Neither concept is absolute and both deal with discretion in individual cases. Both seek to prevent a process that ought to be neutral from being corrupted by partisan politics. But there is one significant difference between the two principles: overzealous prosecutors who are not subject to oversight can certainly cause harm to individuals, but an armed police force that is answerable to no one can terrorize an entire population. Police independence is an important concept, but it must be interpreted relatively narrowly, as an exception to the default rule that police are answerable to the government.Police look on as protesters camp on GO Transit railroad tracks in Hamilton, Ont., on Feb. 25, 2020.It is ironic, to say the least, that the same government that last year ran roughshod over a well-established understanding of prosecutorial independence would now hang its hat on an expansive version of police independence that finds no support in our law or good sense. It is true that the federal and provincial governments should not direct the police with respect to the precise details of the operation - how to proceed, whom to arrest, etc. - but they absolutely have the jurisdiction to effect policy more generally by ordering the police to bring an end to illegal blockades.This does not mean, of course, that police should be instructed to storm the barricades with weapons drawn. The police and the government should strive to alleviate rather than exacerbate tensions and the short-term goal of ending the blockade should go hand in hand with a longer-term goal of raising Indigenous living standards and enhancing Indigenous self-government. The law must be enforced carefully and compassionately; but it must be enforced. Canada's ability to function as a viable state governed by the rule of law depends on it.Asher Honickman is a partner at Matthews Abogado LLP and president of Advocates for the Rule of Law, a registered charity.
