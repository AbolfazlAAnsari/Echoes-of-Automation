As CO2 knows no boundaries, this is hardly a green response.The emphasis on coal as the ultimate baddie, whose production we must stop at all costs, misses the real point. If there is no market for coal then coal will not be produced, so the real target should be users of coal. Sixty years ago, coal heated people's homes, powered the railways, produced gas and produced electricity. These markets have since moved almost completely away from coal on to other fuels and coal production has plummeted accordingly.Among the few remaining users of coal are heavy industry - particularly steel and cement. If we are to reach net-zero carbon by 2050, then we need to reduce the demand for coal from steel and cement works. If we do that, coal production will fall automatically.Clive RixWest BridgfordEU's vaccine messThe European Union's self-inflicted vaccine catastrophe will hardly be eased by Ursula von der Leyen's threat to invoke Article 122 of the EU Treaty, allowing confiscation of factories, suspension of patents and export bans.Is she trying to make Brexit look respectable?Dr John DohertyStratford-upon-AvonToo clever by halfKudos to the government forcoming up with a plan so cunningthe great Baldrick himself would be proud.As vaccine centres report cancellations from folk who want the Pfizer vaccine not the Oxford one due to scare stories, the government has claimed there is a vaccine shortage. Creating a shortage creates demand and folk are now desperately rebooking for any vaccine while stocks last.

I wonder to which northern city Tim Davie will be moving?Dr Anthony IngletonSheffield"
