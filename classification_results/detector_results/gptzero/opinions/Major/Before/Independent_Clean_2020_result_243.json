The message to the public is straightforward - protect the vulnerable - stay apart - work together.It will be arrogance that kills people, the arrogance of politicians that they know best without learning from others. The arrogance of individuals that they can do what they want because the risk to themselves is small.Jon Hawksley                                            FranceEurope can 'learn to live with' coronavirus says WHO directorIn management theory, there is such a thing as a \"halo effect\": management see something outstanding in what an employee does and they then generalise, believing that he or she is excellent in all respects (I would also posit the existence of a \"horns\" effect, but that's for another day).I think it likely that Dominic Cummings's downright brilliance at creating simple if misleading slogans, which do actually win elections, has been extrapolated to the point of believing that he is also indispensable for the running of the government. Although there are of course actual members of the government who may be blamed, I would nevertheless suggest that the evidence thus far is that Cummings couldn't advise the effective running of the proverbial whelk-stall.Cole Davis                                            NorwichWildlife crueltyReading of the desperately sad details of the lasttwo Northern White rhinosin existence, I could not help but reflect on the global tragedies occurring which, it seems, receive little or no condemnation or consequences towards the nations responsible for the devastation.Is it actually not allowed to criticise the countries that have inflicted near-extinction on colossally important species? To condemn them for their hideously cruel treatment of animals which has possibly created a global pandemic that has had immensely serious consequences, and killed hundreds of thousands of people? This is simply unbelievable.The countries that allow such appalling things as the exploitation of elephants, rhino and pangolin to go on unchecked, without clamping down ruthlessly to exterminate the trade that is the whole reason for the wholesale destruction, should be the subject of absolute global condemnation and, if necessary, sanctions, until they effectively deal with their staggeringly cruel approach to animals.Penny Little                                          Great Haseley, OxfordshirePM's orgy of embarrassmentOur prime minister has apparently said the country is going through\"an orgy of national embarrassment\"about its traditions and history. I'm not sure about that, but the country is certainly going through a pandemic which has resulted in some 41,000 deaths - most likely more. That's as well as a backlog of essential cancer and other medical treatments, widespread unemployment - which can only get worse - and as yet unmeasured resultant mental health problems, disruption (through clear government incompetence) to education, and more. We are also facing a no-deal Brexit.And yet the prime minister finds the time to pontificate about the BBC's Proms. That simply highlights the PM's lack of focus and ability to govern, alongside his immature love of his own voice when pontificating about (diverting, he hopes) irrelevances.Beryl Wall                                            London"
