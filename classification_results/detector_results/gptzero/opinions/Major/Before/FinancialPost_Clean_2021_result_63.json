            "inputText": "By Joel TrenamanAmidst the Liberal government's often-dubious, budget-less spending sprees under the banner of COVID-19 relief, the idea that Canada's airline industry continues to \"negotiate\" for an aid package is appalling. It's time to draw the line against additional airline subsidies, and support for Air Canada in particular. With the payments and concessions it has received already - and recent record profits - the company is in better shape than it is letting on.For the past year, Air Canada has been sitting on $2.3 billion collected in advance fares for flights that never took place, refusing to refund those customers. Transport Canada and the Canadian Transportation Agency have shielded(https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-passenger-rights-refunds-credit-cancelled-flights-cta-eu-us-1.5524899) airlines and made excuses for their unwillingness to give the money back, conveniently suspending the air travel complaints process as soon as the cancellations started. Meanwhile, opposition parties(https://www.travelweek.ca/news/conservatives-ndp-demand-passenger-refunds-as-condition-of-any-airline-bailouts/) and consumers have called for the company to issue refunds (instead of vouchers) as part of any national assistance. (In slight contrast, WestJet(https://blog.westjet.com/a-further-discussion-on-refunds/ ) started issuing refunds in October.) On March 3, it was reported(https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/air-canada-bailout-refunds-deal-1.5935965)that Air Canada is willing to do the right thing as part of a bailout package.Any conditions on refunding fares are unacceptable. Substantial current losses or not, a company that treats its customers with such disregard that it won't return money for services it did not provide should not be rewarded with public funds, especially at a time when COVID-19 has left many households barely hanging on. Effectively, Air Canada is expecting Canadian taxpayers to foot the bill for air traveller refunds, while the company would aim to save face and maintain its cash reserves. Already infamous for inspiring thousands upon thousands of service complaints long before the pandemic, the stonewalling of consumers this past year has left no recourse but the filing of class action(https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/air-canada-faces-potential-class-action-lawsuits-in-u-s-over-ticket-refunds-1.5169158) proceedings in both Canada and the United States.Opinion: Government must step in to save our airlines(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-government-must-step-in-to-save-our-airlines)Air Canada promising to refund passengers whose flights were cancelled due to COVID-19: Union(https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/unifors-dias-says-air-canada-pledging-passenger-refunds-as-aid-negotiations-drag-on)No one can deny that the pandemic has been devastating to airline industry revenues. However, before the onset, companies were flying high. Financial statements indicated that in 2019, Air Canada generated record operating revenues of more than $19 billion(https://aircanada.mediaroom.com/2020-02-18-Air-Canada-Reports-2019-Annual-Results), with record unrestricted liquidity. That record increased to $8 billion in unencumbered cash by the end of 2020, a number that aviation market intelligence firm CAPA(https://centreforaviation.com/analysis/reports/air-canada-encouraging-signs-for-potential-government-support-553048) called \"a solid foundation for navigating the ongoing crisis.\" Air Canada themselves expressed confidence upon the release of their 2020 Annual Results(https://aircanada.mediaroom.com/2021-02-12-Air-Canada-Reports-2020-Annual-Results): \"investors and financial markets share our optimistic long-term outlook.\"So, what exactly needs bailing out?Air Canada has already benefited greatly from government COVID-19 relief measures. For example, it has externalized labour costs, grossing $656 million in 2020(https://www.aircanada.com/content/dam/aircanada/portal/documents/PDF/en/quarterly-result/2020/2020_FSN_q4.pdf) (thehighest disclosed amount of any publicly traded compan(https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/air-canada-492-million-in-wage-subsidy-covid-19-1.5824950)y through Sept. 30) from the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. That's part of a reported $1.7 billion(https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/air-canada-bailout-refunds-deal-1.5935965) from CEWS for all airlines through March of this year. Despite this inflow, more than 20,000 employees were furloughed or released in 2020, and another 1,700 in January. That's roughly 60 per cent of its staff that will have turned to CERB or other government support. If the airline receives further government money, would it even rehire these workers, taking them off public assistance? There is still little demand in the market to ramp up flight operations.The Liberal government also approved Air Canada's bid to buy Transat(https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/federal-government-air-canada-transat-1.5911340) A.T. Inc., for a pandemic-driven bargain price ($190 million), despite the Competition Bureau's determination(https://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/04522.html) that it would be \"likely to result in substantial anti-competitive effects\" including \"a substantial lessening or prevention of competition on 83 total routes.\" There's still enough money around to take advantage of a key rival during an emergency.The broader industry has also pushed back against each series of public health directives and have faced traveller accusations of poor safety, such as lax masking protocols.(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/covid-precautions-refunds-canadians-airlines-1.5640911) Airline companies have also asked the government to organize and pay for rapid testing rather than get it done themselves, and generally given the impression that their economic considerations should override protective health regulations.Even if the need was clear, recent Canadian governments have a terrible track record when it comes to managing sector bailout or recovery funding. Remember the auto industry distress in 2009? In 2014, the auditor general(https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_201411_05_e_39963.html) reported that it was \"impossible to gain a complete picture of the assistance provided, the difference the assistance made to the viability of the companies, and the amounts recovered and lost.\" Estimated net losses on this federal \"investment\" range from $1.15 to $3.7 billion.(https://www.taxpayer.com/media/CTF-AutoBailoutReport-2015.pdf)What is Air Canada to do instead of loitering at the treasury door? At this point, wait this out. Vaccinations are in progress, and millions will be eager to travel when it is safer to do so. Gradually refund those fares, and improve service in order to rebuild some goodwill with customers. Mitigate losses with planes parked in hangars as the public safety net supports workers. Pat themselves on the back for building a monetary cushion, take bank loans if necessary and let that unrestricted liquidity flow.After a year in which unrestrained largesse has led to a deficit that is likely to hit $400 billion, the government should only be supporting those who actually need it. Canadians can rationalize COVID-19 relief to individuals and small businesses, but not large corporations who have already broken the public trust.Joel Trenaman is a writer in Winnipeg !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
