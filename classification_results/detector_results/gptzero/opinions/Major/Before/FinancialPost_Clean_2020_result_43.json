            "inputText": "In his book, \"The Second Mountain,\" New York Times columnist David Brooks distinguishes between \"neighbours\" and \"individuals.\" Individuals, he writes, are concerned with making today and tomorrow better. A neighbour, however, \"plants trees that will bear fruit she will never eat, and cast shade she will never enjoy.\" As we come to terms with what kind of post-COVID-19 Canada we want, we all need to think like good neighbours.Why? Because the future is a long game, not a short one. Whether it be as citizens, business leaders, politicians or policymakers, we must stop simply optimizing today and tomorrow and start thinking generationally. Too often, when we talk about the long term, we are only looking ahead to the next election, to the next quarter's financial results or to our next vacation.There are good reasons for this, as this approach provides immediate rewards and humans are hardwired to seek out instant gratification. Think, for instance, about the grip social media has on us. \"Likes\" and \"shares\" may feel good in the moment, but their effect on our happiness is fleeting.Neighbours don't aim for short-term gratification. They play the long game. They ask the big questions: What are we creating for future generations? Are the decisions we make today building blocks for a more prosperous, influential and resilient Canada tomorrow?Despite its challenges, Canada is the envy of many. It's a country that millions of people around the world would love to call home. But that version of Canada is not a given. As the pandemic has taught us, our prosperity is fragile. Yet we can protect it, not just for ourselves, but for future generations, as well. To do so, we need to think big. We need to set bold goals. And we need to start now, because prosperity takes planning.To plan for the future, we need to examine the past. What has been the source of Canada's success to date? What principles have guided our country? The answer lies in a marriage of resources, ingenuity, openness and determination. Yes, Canada is blessed with abundant natural wealth, but its people are its greatest asset. They have built a society that, while it still grapples with issues of racism and inequality, is more tolerant and inclusive than most nations on earth. Canadians' diverse backgrounds and experiences enable our businesses to connect, engage and trade all over the world.COVID-19, however, is threatening that prosperity. Already, the number of immigrants coming to Canada is predicted to drop by half in the coming year. As governments and citizens grapple with fears of infection, broken supply chains and closed borders, they risk turning inward. They risk acting like individuals, prioritizing the short term, instead of neighbours, working together for the long term.But it doesn't have to be this way. As we begin mapping our country's post-COVID-19 future, let's imagine what a big, bold Canada looks like - a Canada that is prosperous, diverse, resilient and globally influential. The Century Initiative envisions a Canada that is home to 100 million people by the year 2100. With such numbers, we will be able to enhance our economy at home and our influence abroad.In order to get there, we must ground this vision in thoughtful, careful and purposeful growth. We must support it with the right investments in education and in national and urban infrastructure - including digital technologies and networks - that connect our communities and enable them to grow in a sustainable manner. We must support parents with a national child-care strategy and support our children with early education programs. And we must foster entrepreneurship and innovation.This job cannot be left to government alone. Businesses, civil society, universities and other institutions must all do their part to bring a bold, courageous long-term vision for Canada to fruition. We can start by making the case to Canadians. We can begin by challenging ourselves to think differently about how we define the \"future,\" and the kind of Canada we want.At 100 million strong, Canada will not just be the envy of the world, but a world leader - one that can lead the way to a more inclusive and egalitarian future for all. But to build this future, we must start having this conversation right now.The Century Initiative is prepared to play our part. We call on everyone in the public and private sectors who recognize the power and importance of long-term thinking to join us in charting a path to the tomorrow we want for our future generations.The neighbours we may never know are counting on us.National PostLisa Lalande is the CEO, and Mark Wiseman is a global investment executive and chair of the board of directors, of the Century Initiative.Chris Bloomer: Pipelines are vital for the economic recovery(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/chris-bloomer-pipelines-are-vital-for-the-economic-recovery/wcm/7c98814a-2478-4a30-b7c2-f209893b6740/)Matt Gurney: We're 100 days in, and the future is still hard to predict(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/matt-gurney-one-hundred-days-in-the-future-is-still-hard-to-predict/wcm/efa7c2e6-fd29-4c2e-8aab-894c3ae9b2ab/) !@COPYRIGHT=© 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.
