While this may feel like deja vu, the drivers behind the recent spike in prices and the current housing market downturn are different from the ones seen in the 2000s. This time around, the US financial system is better prepared, and a national crisis is less likely.It's true that US homeowners should prepare for an ugly 2023. After years of underinvestment and suppressed supply, UShome pricesrose an eye-popping 45% between January 2020 and June 2022, as low interest rates and the surge in remote work spurred demand. For comparison, in the lead-up to the housing downturn that started 16 years ago,priceswere up by 30% over a comparable period.But the housing bubble in the 2000s was underpinned by predatory lending, poor underwriting, adjustable-rate mortgages and rampant speculation. Americans were convinced that housing was a great short-term investment and that prices would only continue to rise. This famously turned out not to be the case.Asinterest ratesrose leading into 2006,pricesfinally began to slide later that year, and homeowners started defaulting on theirmortgage payments. As prices fell further, homeowners rushed to dump their properties, creating a feedback loop that cascaded throughout the entire real estate market. The subsequent financial crisis was triggered by mass defaults in low-quality mortgages that had been wrapped up in mortgage-backed securities. These assets suddenly became near-worthless, which threw the financial system into crisis.Additionally, years of rampant demand spurredbuildersto overbuild in the early 2000s, flooding the country with a home surplus. As a result, following the Great Recession, it took years for demand to work through the vast housing stock that had been amassed. This, in turn, crushed thehomebuilding industry, causing chronicunderbuildingover the subsequent years.Fast forward to today, and the situation is very different:Home pricesare falling because the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates to quell inflation. This, in turn, has pushed mortgage rates higher. While the average rate on a30-year mortgagefell sharply last week, it's still more than double what it was a year ago (3.10% a year ago vs. 6.61% today). These rates make financing new home purchases unaffordable for many buyers, so demand is slowing and prices are falling.Fortunately, demand and supply fundamentals could limit the downside for US home prices. Millennials, the largest generational cohort since the baby boomers, have gotten older and are looking to buy their first homes. Unfortunately for them, there aren't enough to go around. But this means high prices, even though they're starting to fall and will continue to do so, will likely be somewhat sticky. In essence, demand from Millennials will probably help keep prices from entering freefall -- as was the case in 2008. It's highly unlikely this decline would spark another financial crisis.Additionally, in the years that followed the 2008 financial crisis, new regulations were introduced.Banksare now required to be better capitalized;lending standardsare much more rigorous, leading to higher-quality loans; mostmortgagesare fixed-rate; andfinancial derivatives, such as asset-backed securities, are better regulated.

Indeed,loan-to-value ratios, which measure the amount of a mortgage relative to the value of a home, for US mortgages have fallen to just 42% -- a 12-year low. This creates more of a \"cushion\" for prices to decline before home values fall below the loans that underpin them. Thus, if a home is sold at a loss, it'll likely hit homeowners before it hits the banks.The ongoing housing price correction will have implications for the US economy, but lower home prices should help to quell high inflation. It will indeed come at the expense of economic growth, ashomebuildingactivity is already slowing rapidly and consumer confidence (and spending) will likely suffer as well. But it's unlikely we're heading for a repeat of 2008.Opinion by Erik LundhTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
