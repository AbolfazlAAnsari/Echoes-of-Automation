            "inputText": "By Jennifer Grant, Martha Fulford and Neil RauAs COVID-19 recedes, many strident voices continue to call for ongoing restrictions - mainly on such social media platforms as Twitter. These fiercest proponents of \"COVID-zero\" need to acquiesce that the coronavirus is here to stay, variant upon variant. To be fair to this group, in the early days of the pandemic, they believed wholeheartedly that COVID-19 could be eliminated, as did the WHO and the Public Health Agency of Canada. Unfortunately, this was the only accepted perspective until recently. Those who expressed reservations about the feasibility and societal and economic costs of this approach were silenced on social media, sometimes reported to professional colleges for discipline, and subjected to calumny - both publicly and privately. Even now, as public health moves to a more balanced approach to COVID-19, social media tactics that have been honed over two years of the pandemic continue to polarize the debate, slowing our return to normal.Let's explore the \"misinformation\" trope: it is applied unfairly when people have used their best interpretation of the facts to arrive at a conclusion that is later disproven. These are errors, usually honest ones (recall the initial enthusiasm for chloroquine and ivermectin as COVID-19 treatments). Misinformation is also a charge used against nuanced interpretations of complex facts countering an overly simplified one-size-fits-all approach (e.g. not every member of the population has the same need for booster doses of vaccine). This is an appropriate response to complexity. Likewise, it is wrong to label as \"misinformation\" the interpretation of the same facts to arrive at disparate conclusions - this is healthy scientific discourse. True \"misinformation\" is calculated and self-serving. Purveyors of misinformation know that what they are saying is false, but they forge ahead, often with an ulterior motive.If someone says that school closures caused greater harm to children than benefits, is this \"misinformation?\" There are certainly data supporting the assertion(https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/20/opinion/omicron-schools-do-not-close.html), and few that counter it. Likewise, does arguing that vaccines do not stop transmission(https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2116597), or that natural immunity is at least as effective(https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm) as vaccine immunity, make one an \"anti-vaxxer\" or a \"revisionist(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-we-should-debate-the-best-covid-treatments-but-lets-eschew-revisionist/)?\" One can certainly disagree, but much of the medical literature supports these arguments. Does one join the league of \"COVID deniers\" for questioning the true impact of cloth mask use on community transmission? This, when the best done trial(https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi9069) showed no efficacy of cloth masks and minimal benefit with better designed surgical masks.Prosecuting erstwhile \"misinformation\" has resulted in ridiculous examples of scientific censorship, such as banning the prestigious Cochrane Collaborative from Instagram(https://www.acsh.org/news/2021/11/14/covid-misinformation-blunder-instagram-censors-widely-respected-cochrane-collaboration-15937) after its review on masks concluded that there was little evidence to support their use in the community. Likewise, the British Medical Journal, one of the most reputable peer reviewed journals in medicine, has been cited as misinformation by Facebook(https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/376/bmj.o95.full.pdf). It does beg the question, who is the arbiter of truth? Is it the executives of technology giants? Is it the TV news director? The newspaper columnist? The Twitter doctor with the most followers? And why is the \"truth\" in Canada different than the truth in, for example, Scandinavia? Should critical social decisions be made in quiet backrooms with profit motives front of mind or hashed out, through vigorous debate, in full view of the public?Censorship of debate would at least be \"fair\" if all sides were held to the same standard, but that is not the case. Anybody found criticizing public health when restrictions are being expanded is subject to sanction(https://www.cpso.on.ca/News/Key-Updates/Key-Updates/COVID-misinformation). Yet, entire organizations(https://protectbc.ca/ ), publicly supported by many physicians, continue to vociferously criticize those same officials when the situation changes and they relax restrictions, even calling them out at press conferences. What is the result? In the current context it has become acceptable to massively exaggerate(https://twitter.com/FurnessColin/status/1507799230743822339) the risk(https://twitter.com/kashprime/status/1501576482417778698) of COVID-19 to children, no matter how wrong it is(https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02867-1/fulltext?mod=ANLink#seccestitle140), or how much harm it has done(https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/12/27/1068298117/-17-trillion-thats-how-much-the-pandemic-could-take-away-from-todays-kids) to those same(https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/148/4/e2021052201/179731/Medical-Admissions-Among-Adolescents-With-Eating) children, but not to intervene to reduce(https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/coronavirus-health-workers-speak-out.html) these harms.In the end, ad hominem attacks, unilateral application of standards and the wide misuse of the term \"misinformation\" have muzzled valid criticism, poisoned dialogue and silenced the perspectives of people with valuable insights. The first major consequence is that valid ideas have been rejected without full consideration. This has resulted in a very skewed(https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/354938/adults-estimates-covid-hospitalization-risk.aspx) understanding of the real risk of COVID-19 and the merits of restrictions and vaccines by the public, mostly along political lines.Opinion: Beware misinformation about COVID risks to kids(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-beware-misinformation-about-covid-risks-to-kids)Opinion: The wrong people are making decisions on school closures. Our children deserve better(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-the-wrong-people-are-making-decisions-on-school-closures-our-children-deserve-better)The second chilling effect is that valid commentators have been scared away from public discourse, no matter how valid their concerns. Some have legitimate fears of loss of livelihood, others fear social opprobrium or professional repercussions(https://www.cpso.on.ca/News/Key-Updates/Key-Updates/COVID-misinformation). Others lack the will to fight. Has this happened? We assure you it has(https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n489?ijkey=b88b004cded55d99d9af8a3543c2d53dfa6b7bba&;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha): from the unapologetic attack by the CBC on participants in a University of Calgary debate(https://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/ombudsman/reviews/Science_and_Nuance) to the most recent vague, disjointed vilification(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-physicians-who-spread-misinformation-may-be-eroding-trust-in-health/) of physicians advocating for children.

When done well, reasonable people from apparently disparate points of view often show more agreement than not(https://www.dropbox.com/s/6ocnd6vho8npfuy/Great%20Debate%2010.30.mp4?dl=0). Those who speak up thoughtfully, especially with valid data, should be acknowledged for their courage and met with respect and thoughtful critique. We should not mindlessly accept anything, nor should we blindly reject. Nobody speaks gospel and the public should meet all claims with scepticism, including those who proclaim themselves prophets - COVID-19 is a novel virus and no one is an \"expert.\" There is no right way to \"do\" COVID-19. If we look around the globe, no two places have responded in the same way. We need to maintain skepticism about \"what works\" when so many other variables explain the rise and fall of COVID cases. All claims should also consider the interaction with social values and consequences, lest we end up with the status quo: a policy agenda that is not aligned with reality.Special to National PostDr. Jennifer Grant is an infectious diseases specialist and medical microbiologist in Vancouver.
