This stands in stark contrast to former Vice President Biden.During the debate, Biden laid out a plan to improve the state of health care in America. While not perfect, Biden's plan would allow many Americans to continue getting health insurance coverage the same way they do now. And he said he would work with Congress to make the cost of that coverage cheaper while also increasing its quality.That quality will be critical if we as a nation have any chance of flattening the curve and getting out of this ever-worsening coronavirus pandemic.While Trump has continued to boast about his decision to ban some people from China entering the U.S. during the early days of the pandemic, his performance on COVID-19 has been utterly dismal.Not only does Trump continue to suffer from denialism about the real impact COVID-19 has had on America — he and the White House actively downplay the virus as it currently spreads throughout the country. It seems as if the president pays no attention to his briefings from government health experts on the virus and the climbing death toll.Instead of pushing for the utilization of masks, social distancing measures, and expanding hospital capacity, Trump spent the debate talking about the potential for a vaccine and saying we will have a vaccine in as soon as a few weeks from now.The truth is that even if a COVID-19 vaccine was approved in the next couple of weeks — which is highly unlikely — the experts have been clear that it could take close to 10 months for enough Americans to receive it for our society to return to any sense of normalcy.And while none of us knows how long we will be stuck with COVID-19 and the restrictions on our behavior it has created, at least a potential Biden administration would tell us the truth and reason with us about the real things we can do to combat this deadly disease.Of course, COVID-19 and health care are interconnected issues. Trump seems to be losing on both with less than two weeks before Election Day.But beyond those issues, Trump also appears to be losing his ability to connect with the American people.During the final debate of 2016, Trump closed strong and convinced many to vote for him. After almost four years of his failed leadership, he has nothing to show for his time in office besides an unpopular tax reform law that gave the biggest benefits to rich Americans, along with criminal justice reform.The president’s many shortcomings have pushed Trump and his GOP allies to make new trumped-up accusations against Joe Biden and his son Hunter. While steeped in misinformation and murky allegations, these attacks seem to be another desperate attempt by Trump to drag Biden into the mud.During the debate, Trump attempted to attack Joe Biden with these claims of a supposed scandal, but these wildly thrown punches failed to land.Yes, Biden has been in Washington for almost five decades. And yes, Biden has admittedly made some mistakes that have cost some dearly. But Biden isn't engaged in foreign fraud or quid-pro-quo scandals that resulted in Trump’s impeachment. And Biden has released his tax returns for all to see — unlike Trump.Trump’s wild attacks and failed attempts to hurt Biden should make clear to voters that the president has nothing to run on and lacks the clear closing message that catapulted him to the White House in 2016.Trump has lost the sparkle that made him attractive to working and middle-class families four years ago. He is forced to rely on his ever-shrinking base for support — and it looks like that won't be enough to get him reelected.
