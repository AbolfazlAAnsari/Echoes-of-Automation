Is it our obsession with the weather, our insistence on apologising, our stiff upper lip or constantly offering cups of tea? It can be hard to define, but what is true is that we are all more alike than we realise.Our similarities and innate desire to help our neighbours is something I have noticed over the past year, and have been humbled as a faith leader to see how the nation has rallied together during the pandemic, supporting one another that rarely makes headlines. The inbuilt strength of the British people is something to shout about.But as we have also seen in recent months, freedom of speech is something to respect and be mindful of how it impacts our diverse communities across the country to ensure that our bond as a society is maintained and strengthened. We may challenge each other's views but do so with tolerance and compassion. We do not want to fan the flames of Islamophobia and or any other anti-religious rhetoric, and can prevent this by educating ourselves on each other's differences, because we are all British regardless of our race and or religion.As Yorkshire Imam, today I'm speaking to my congregation about why St George's Day should be a day where everyone reflects on the past year and recognises how united we are by our shared identity - being proudly British.Qari Asim, MBEYorkshirePolitical sleazeAfter learning about Johnny Mercer'sresignation/sackingI began to think of the scandals, law-breaking, lies, deceit, fabrication, obfuscation, etc that the last few years have brought to light.Mr Mercer, ex-defence minister, said he worked in a cesspit where lies were common currency and in the most distrustful environment. What an indictment of our government. And if true, what an appalling way to run a country.To compound this damning statement I read, that Mr Tony Blair, ex-PM, seemingly dismissed Mr Johnson's apparent agreement to help Mr Dyson with the supply of ventilators. Mr Blair is reported as saying, \"I find it hard to get worked up about it\" in relation to the financial help Boris offered Mr Dyson.To not get \"worked up\" about breaking one's word might be normal for Blair and Johnson but for honest people it is anathema. There are so many incidents of lies, deceit, half-truths, expenses scandals, etc in this government that I am ashamed of my support of the Conservative party and the organisation that helps run the country.I dare say that there are good, honourable MPs but it appears to me that they are either silenced or don't care what less honourable MPs do. Principled people, like Mr Mercer, are few and far between and obviously have no place in today's government.There is no justification to say that it was acceptable to break the rules because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Honesty should always take priority over expediency. Honesty cannot be disguised, expediency can be confused with lies and deceit.I wish Mr Mercer all the very best in the future but he must realise that good, honest people don't get on in the world of politics or business. Sad really.Keith PooleBasingstokeBlinded by nationalismIn the recent report last week onSNP government policiesrelating to poverty, life expectancy, education, childcare, healthcare, drug deaths, homeless victims, Covid-19 vaccination, economy, police, freedom of speech, local government, fund distribution and procurement, it would seem that in every single area their policies have failed.On top of this, an independent Scotland would leave the UK borders exposed.Therefore, we must not be blinded by nationalism.I write as a director of a business based in Scotland who would have to seriously reconsider - along with many others - the genuine viability of remaining in Scotland should it become an independent country.Stephen SimpsonPowysRead MoreBoris Johnson calls European Super League 'a cartel'Why is football exempt from Tory profit-hungry ideology?Boris Johnson commented on the Super League faster than the unrest in Northern Ireland"
