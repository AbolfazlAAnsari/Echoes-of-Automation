A frail 84-year-old patient, fled his home in Kherson after it was bombed and destroyed by Russian artillery.It’s so heartbreaking to see innocent lives turned upside down.He told me he had not eaten for four days, he was disheveled. He was suffering from chest pain, and we scrambled to find a defibrillator and an EKG machine. The EKG machine was from the 1970s. He died.We need defibrillators and EKGs, now.An orthopedic surgeon in Kiev operating on wounded Ukrainian soldiers advised me that he is in desperate need of surgical hardware supplies. We do not have what he needs.We need surgical tools, now.UKRAINIAN CHILD DEATH TOLL MOUNTS, HUMANITARIAN CRISIS WORSENS WITH SOME CITIES LEFT WITH 3 TO 4 CITIES OF FOODAnother patient was suffering from a viral illness that was likely contracted on a commercial crowded train. The patient had severe vomiting and diarrhea—potentially deadly in a war zone resulting in extreme dehydration. I was able to locate a few bottles of Zofran, a simple drug that addresses precisely these symptoms. But we did not have enough.We need basic medicines, now.We also need protection—physical protection.There are not just bombs falling from the sky in Ukraine.

My heart was pounding I was more scared of this bearded Russian man in my face than when a bomb hit 8 miles from our camp in Lviv.A retired U.S. Marine literally stepped in to protect me. Those Russians disappeared, along with some of our medical supplies.I was angry at first but I wondered if they were taking them to treat young naive injured Russian soldiers- we are all human and any loss of life is tragic.I can make a guess: Russian President Vladimir Putin is not only attacking medical facilities in war zones from the sky and with artillery, but he has sent thugs to harass and intimidate foreign medical professionals like me on the ground who are desperately trying, under difficult circumstances, to help. And he is making it as difficult as possible by interfering with our medical care.  I do not have the words to describe how despicable this is.ROME, ITALY - MARCH 22: Ukrainian refugees evacuated from Lviv by Italian Red Cross arrive to Rome, on March 22, 2022 in Rome, Italy.

It was crushed swollen, infected, and at high risk of loss but we saved it. Likewise, a malnourished infant, in distress, is now getting the care he needs.UKRAINE SAYS ITS RETAKEN KEY KYIV SUBURB; BATTLE FOR MARIUPOL RAGESMy colleagues and I are at risk.
