But this isn't the first time the Liberals have tried to claim credit for recycled promises that they could have delivered but didn't.So if you voted Liberal in 2019 in hopes that they would end the outrageous advantages Canada lavishes upon American tech companies, the government is now saying that you'll need to wait longer, and vote Liberal again, if you want to see these promises fulfilled.The logos for Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google are seen in a combination photo. The tech giants, along with Netflix, are threatening the survival of Canadian culture, observers say.Yesterday's promises to finally tax Big Tech fairly were ripped right out of the Liberals' last election platform, but other 2019 promises have quietly disappeared.Take for example the government's 2019 election promise(https://liberal.ca/our-platform/culture/) to \"strengthen the regional mandate of CBC/Radio-Canada, so that local stations can broadcast more local news.\" The CBC clearly needs the help. When the pandemic started, it was so overwhelmed by local news events happening all over the country that it shut down local TV news all together to keep the teetering network from \"going dark.\" Yet recently introduced amendments to the Broadcasting Act provide no update to CBC's regional mandate, and the fall economic update doesn't mention the CBC once.Or what about the promise to \"move forward, in our first year, with legislation that will take appropriate measures to ensure that all content providers - including internet giants - offer meaningful levels of Canadian content in their catalogues, contribute to the creation of Canadian content in both official languages.\"The new Broadcasting Act purports to do just that, but in fact does no such thing. It's just another Big Tech tease. The new law would give the CRTC the power to require the likes of Netflix to invest in Canadian content but wouldn't actually require the CRTC to use that power. Doing nothing would still be an option. The government promises to clear up the matter in a special directive which will come - you guessed it - later.Here are the facts. Canadian media is in big trouble. Newspapers and broadcasters, including the CBC, have laid off thousands of people this year. Why? Because Google and Facebook sell ads that are much less expensive. They can do that because Ottawa allows them to pay no income tax, charge no sales tax, sell ads against content other people create with no need to pay for it, and disseminate content like the Christchurch mosque massacre video with no consequence, even though Canadian broadcasters would end up in court for doing the same thing.I hope that protecting Canada's cultural sovereignty doesn't become the new childcare: something the government promises perpetually but never fulfils. Governments have been promising to enact affordable childcare since I was a child. Standing up for Canadian journalism and democracy is a matter of urgent national importance. It's time to move from promises to action.Daniel Bernhard (@sendinthewolf) is executive director of FRIENDS of Canadian Broadcasting.
