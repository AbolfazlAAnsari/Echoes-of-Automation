The conventional wisdom was, after having his company disemboweled, he would lift himself briefly off the ground, beg for forgiveness and then slink away into cancelled obscurity.But as a man of principle, he decided to not bend to the mob.

Bullying, abuse, violence and rioting are now the upfront Democratic election strategies for 2020. I know, it doesn’t make sense, but it is all the left has ever had — they feed on envy, jealousy and hate, and condition their base to view everything, especially their own lives, through a lens of victimhood and enemies.This attack on Goya especially exposes the core of the fraud of identity politics.
