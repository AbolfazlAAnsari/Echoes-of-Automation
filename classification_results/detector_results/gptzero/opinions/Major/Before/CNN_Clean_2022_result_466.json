Just last week, I replayed that ad on my show, and again listeners responded with how powerful they thought it was and urged Democrats to embrace it. Then came Obama's speeches Saturday doing just that.Obama imploredthe crowd at his first stop in Michigan: \"Who will fight for your freedom? Is it a bunch of Republican politicians and judges who think they should get to decide when you start a family or how many children you have, who you marry or who you love?\" He then added, \"Or is it leaders like (Michigan Democratic Gov.) Gretchen Whitmer who believe that the freedom to make these personal decisions belong to every American, not politicians in Washington?\"A short time later,at a rally in Milwaukee, Obama again posed that question while flanked by Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Democratic US Senate candidate Mandela Barnes: \"Is it Republican politicians and judges who think they should get to decide when you start a family or how many children you should have, or who you marry or who you love?\" Obama continued, \"Or is it Democratic leaders who believe that the freedom to make these most intimate personal decisions belong to every American, not politicians, mostly men, sitting somewhere in Washington?\"The 44th President then put it pointedly: \"That's the choice in this election; that's what you have to decide.\"Obama did address the challenges of inflation and the economy. After acknowledging the pain caused by rising prices,he noted, \"Who's going to do something about it? Republicans are having a field day running ads talking about it, but what is their actual solution to it?\"Obama pointed out that inflation isa global issue-- not a uniquely American one -- as a result of problems caused by the pandemic and Russia's war with Ukraine. There's no easy solution because if there were, leaders of each country would've reduced inflation already.Recent polls find voter interest in this election ison the higher endfor a midterm. But Democrats still must energize their base. Saying inflation causes pain without offering a solution doesn't get anyone to the polls. But doubling down on extremists in the GOP coming for your freedoms does move people.If Democratic candidates are in search of a closing message that will invigorate their voters, they should follow the lead of Obama, twice elected as President.Make it clear to voters that Democrats will fight for your freedoms. After all, inflation is temporary, but losing your freedom may be permanent.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
