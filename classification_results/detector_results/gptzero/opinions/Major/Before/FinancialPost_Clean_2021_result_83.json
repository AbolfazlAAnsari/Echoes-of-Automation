            "inputText": "When I was training to become a Chartered Accountant (now Chartered Professional Accountant or CPA) one of the most important lessons they drilled into us was the notion of independence. When conducting an audit, the auditor signing off on the auditor's report cannot be related to or best friends with the owner of the company being audited or be heavily invested as a shareholder.This is for a good reason. To maintain trust in the audit process, users of the audited financial statements must know the auditors have not been influenced by any conflict of interest, real or perceived. Of course, the vast majority of auditors are honest and understand their reputation is on the line should there be any questions as to the quality of their audit, for whatever reason.But imagine the following scenario. Rogers and Shaw announce a potential merger deal. Many Canadians become worried about a reduction in competition, increase in prices, and decrease in the quality of customer service. The Competition Bureau is responsible for making a decision on the merger. Suppose Rogers and Shaw start paying a portion of the salaries of the employees of the Competition Bureau, up to a maximum credit of $13,750 per employee.Would Canadians accept that? Could the Competition Bureau be said to be independent and free of any perception of or actual conflict-of-interest in ruling on the Rogers and Shaw merger if Rogers and Shaw were paying part of the salaries of each Competition Bureau employee? It's obviously possible that the Competition Bureau employees would act objectively. As with auditors, their reputations would be at stake. But there would definitely be an appearance of a conflict of interest and that could cause Canadians to lose trust in the objectivity of the proceedings.That is exactly the situation we now have in Canada with the media. I'm not referring to the CBC, which we all know is government-funded, for better or worse - in my opinion, worse! I'm referring to the federal government's $600-million bailout of \"qualified Canadian journalism organizations.\" Ottawa actually now has a list(https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/deductions-credits-expenses/digital-news-subscription/list-qualifying-digital-news-subscriptions.html) of approved media organizations that may be eligible for government funding of a portion of the salaries of their reporters and journalists. Granted, the list is determined largely by formula and is administered by an arm's length board. Moreover, the media organizations that receive government funding may well continue to report on the federal government in an unbiased fashion. The newspapers I read, including this one, certainly do not go easy on the current government. Even so, the appearance of a conflict of interest may cause Canadians to lose trust in the objectivity of the media. Shouldn't we expect the media to avoid even the perception of a conflict of interest? Isn't that the standard the media insists governments hold to?Part of the $600-million funding is a tax credit that individual Canadians can claim, known as the digital news subscription expenses tax credit(https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-31350-digital-news-subscription-expenses.html). The Liberals complained when Stephen Harper's Conservatives created the child fitness and arts tax credits and the family tax cut (a.k.a., income-splitting). They said it was an attempt to buy votes from suburban families. But now the Liberals are doing the same thing. They have enacted the educator school supply tax credit, the climate action incentive and now this new digital news subscription credit.Each individual can claim up to $500 and receive a 15 per cent credit of the $500 ($75). For an extra $75 on your tax refund, is this really worth it? To claim the credit, you have to keep receipts for six years, you may have to submit the receipts to the CRA, and of course the CRA will need to ensure it has enough staff - on top of the 44,000 who already work there at an annual cost of nearly $5 billion - to review proper compliance.Like any accountant in tax season, I'm grateful for the extra business as the federal government makes our income tax system even more complicated. And as a reader of newspapers I'm happy to get my $75 for subscriptions I was going to buy anyway. But as a citizen I'm concerned to see the government fund what is supposed to be, in appearance as well as fact, a free and independent media.In a democratic society, a free and independent media is critical to keeping the government in check. Canadians should not accept a situation in which the government funds the media. It's time to scrap this Ministry of Truth-type $600-million bailout and eliminate any perception of a conflict of interest in our media's reporting of the government.Neal Winokur, CPA, is author of The Grumpy Accountant. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
