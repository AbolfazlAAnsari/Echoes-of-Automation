Also: Tests for athletes; small-town journalism.To the Editor:Re “An Opinion Editor and Writer at The New York Times Quits” (Business Day, July 15):I read Bari Weiss’s resignation letter with … well, a sense of resignation. And elation. Resignation because you’re losing a fresh, skeptical voice. Elation because she called you out on your new toxic woke culture and put her money where her mouth is.I identify as a left-leaning centrist. My education trained me to greet the world with an open mind. I believe in dialogue, not debate. And as a Times reader since college, I can see it plain as day: The Times has largely abandoned dialogue when it comes to cultural issues and ideas. You’ve handed the keys to America’s greatest paper to a strident, new orthodoxy that will not tolerate intellectual diversity. God, how sad.I used to love reading William Safire’s column in The Times; I didn’t agree with his politics, but I celebrated his dexterity with the language.I never thought I’d turn to The American Conservative for comfort, but at least it has the guts to publish controversial opinions that run counter to conservative orthodoxy. I used to get that from The Times. Want to know how to sell more papers? Publish a greater diversity of ideas, generate more conversation and, every once in a while, make a Jacobin mad.Carl LoebFairfax, Calif.To the Editor:There is suddenly a great deal of concern being expressed over “cancel culture” on the left, generally ignoring that the right has been suppressing dissent and penalizing nonconformity for decades. Still, it cannot be denied that many on the left have adopted an intolerant posture toward those in their own ranks who deviate from what is currently considered politically correct opinion. Free expression is the centerpiece of liberal politics, and its defense must be a priority.Two points must be noted. First, it is not bullying or harassment to have people disagree with your opinions or to be made the subject of criticism for expressing views that others find morally reprehensible. Too often those who complain about “cancel culture” seem suspiciously thin-skinned, at least when it’s their opinions or the opinions of people they agree with that come under attack.Second, speech is not violence. Undoubtedly, words can sting. They can be hurtful and offensive. But the best remedy for the wounds inflicted by words consists of words spoken in rebuttal.Bari Weiss was not forced to leave The Times; she chose to resign in protest. She also chose to make her resignation an indictment of The Times and its workplace culture. Fair enough. But in the escalating war over “cancel culture” there is a danger that both sides are seeking to stigmatize each other. And this mutual application of tar and feathers will not do the cause of free expression any good at all.Stephen NewmanTorontoThe writer is an associate professor of politics at York University.Athletes, Don’t Hog the Covid-19 TestsTo the Editor:Re “Coronavirus Briefing: The Dire State of Testing” (nytimes.com, July 7):Older, symptomatic, high-risk patients sit in cars for hours hoping to be able to get tested for Covid-19 and possibly get results back in a week (if they are still alive). Young healthy athletes get frequent if not daily tests and quick results to make sure that they can keep getting paid to play a game. It’s ridiculous.To all the N.B.A., M.L.B. and N.H.L. players claiming to be champions of social justice: Give up your “athletes’ privilege.” Donate the thousands of tests you will receive to people who really need them.Lee GoldbergNaperville, Ill.Paean to a ReporterTo the Editor:“As Paper Withers, a Reporter Dares to Ask Why” (front page, July 11) was an obituary for small-town journalism. Thank you for having Dan Barry write it.Reporters, photographers and editors nodded in shared experience, laughed occasionally and, maybe, shed a few tears. I’ve known dozens of Evan Brandts (the reporter featured in your article) in my career. Maybe I’m even one.We’ve made a difference, I like to think, a chance that today’s young journalists, better educated, just as diligent, might not have. All of us will be the worse for the official never questioned and the article not written.Timothy J.
