It's difficult to take Trump at his word that he was unaware of who Fuentes is. Given the protection afforded him as a former President, it seems unlikely thathis Secret Service detailwould simply allow anyone to walk up to him without having vetted that person first.It's also worth noting that Fuentes is a star in Trump World. In 2017, he beganhosting the show \"America First\" on the Trump-aligned Right Side Broadcasting Network until it parted ways with Fuentes after he attended the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that brought together White supremacists, neo-Nazis and the like.Fuentes is also thefounder of the Trump-inspired America First Foundation, with the stated mission \"to educate, promote, and advocate for conservative values based on principles of American Nationalism, Christianity, and Traditionalism.\"In fact, Trump's political allies such as GOP Reps.Marjorie Taylor GreeneandPaul Gosarcaused a furor earlier this year by attending a conferenceorganized by Fuentes.However, even if you believe Trump didn't know who Fuentes was before the dinner, he absolutely does now, given the criticism directed at him from fellow Republicans such as former New Jersey Gov.Chris Christieand theRepublican Jewish Coalition. Yet Trump has still not denounced Fuentes or his hate-filled beliefs.Perhaps in a few days, with enough pressure, Trump might denounce Fuentes the same way he \"disavowed\" David Duke during the 2016 campaign. At first, Trumpclaimedhe didn't \"know anything about\" Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizardwho had endorsed him. After a firestorm of criticism, however, Trump - seemingly grudgingly - cut ties to Duke.If past is prologue, future polls will show Trump has not lost any support among his fans for dining with West and Fuentes - and failing to denounce the hateful rhetoric they are known for. This Trump episode can rightfully be labeled many things, from normalizing antisemitism to emboldening White supremacy. But the overriding takeaway is that it is perfectly consistent with Trump's brand.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
