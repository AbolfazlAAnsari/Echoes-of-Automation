Liberals had no constitutional theory other than finding a fifth vote to protect the rights of minorities and women.Conservatives, on the other hand, have spent several decades developing a constitutional theory -- originalism (interpreting the Constitution based on the original intent of the drafters or on the original public meaning at the time of the provision's enactment) -- designed to roll back theNew Deal administrative stateand to overturn the Warren court's precedents protecting minority or privacy rights.As theleaked draft opinionin Dobbs v. Jackson overturning Roe v. Wade should make abundantly clear, the liberal search for a swing vote on a 6-3 conservative court is a fool's errand. The democratic political process -- suspending the filibuster and passing a federal law preventing the states from abridging abortion rights -- is their only hope.In that vein, perhaps liberals should reconsider a constitutional theory that many of them championed for the first half of the 20th century yet abandoned during the 1960s -- judicial restraint. Judges who practiced judicial restraint often upheld state and federal laws and rarely overturned the court's precedents. This approach appealed to liberals who believed that the court should defer to democratically elected bodies while ensuring that minorities were not discriminated against or shut out of the political process.Deference to democracy was inspired byChief Justice John Marshall's 1819 opinionin McCulloch v. Maryland upholding the constitutionality of the National Bank. In McCulloch, Marshall described the Constitution as a \"great outline\" that was intended to \"endure for ages to come\" and to \"be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.\"Marshall contrasted the Constitution's generalities with \"the prolixity of a legal code.\" He recognized that the Constitution granted the federal government broad powers and that the document empowered the people and their representatives, not the states, to make national policy.One of the first scholars to highlight the significance of Marshall's deference to democracy was Harvard law professor James Bradley Thayer. In an 1893 Harvard Law Review essay, \"The Origin and Scope of the American Doctrine of Constitutional Law,\" Thayer said that the court should not invalidate a federal law unless it was unconstitutional \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Any doubts, Thayer argued, should be resolved in favor of constitutionality to encourage elected officials, not nine unelected justices, to govern the country.The progressive push for deference to democracy gained steam during the early 20th century.
