Yet on Tuesday, senior Trump administration officials said that they were receptive to pursuing \"herd immunity,\" an approach touted by a group of scientists who have put out what they call the \"Great Barrington Declaration.\" The idea is that the federal government should let the pandemic run its course until most of the population is infected and has ostensibly developed antibodies to ward off future infections. Typical estimates hold that 70% or more of the population would thereby become infected.According to this idea, vulnerable groups would be targeted for \"focused protection,\" for example, introducing extra precautions such as frequent Covid-19 testing to avoid infections of the elderly living in nursing homes.

The core mistake is the belief that the only alternative to an economic shutdown is to let the virus spread widely in the population. Instead, a set of basic public health measures is enough, as many other countries have shown, to control the spread of the virus.
