            "inputText": "Air travel hasn't been fun for a long time. It's time to change that. In a world of shrinking route choice, hub-and-spoke service, fewer and fewer direct flights and ever-increasing air fares, no wonder recent polling shows over half of Canadians are frustrated with an air travel status quo dominated by just two major carriers. Or that an overwhelming majority - 82 per cent - say it's simply too expensive to fly these days.Before the pandemic, the two carriers controlled over 80 per cent(https://www.statista.com/statistics/545642/air-carrier-canada-domestic-market-share/) of domestic seats. Canada had some of the most expensive airfares in the world, ranking(https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-travel-tourism-competitiveness-report-2019/) 130th out of 138 countries in average airfare costs. Canadians can pay more than twice the price Americans do for similar-distance domestic flights. Add the squeeze from rising inflation and for many of us air travel seems even more out of reach.But there's a new model emerging globally in air travel that has shown success elsewhere and holds promise for revolutionizing air travel in Canada. And if any country needs a solution to make air travel work, it's the vast half-continent we call Canada, with our relatively sparse population stretched along a narrow east-west ribbon.\"Low-cost carriers\" revolutionized airfare in the European Union and Britain, and we can learn from that experience. Imagine air travel being, not a cumbersome, luxury hassle, but more like hopping on a Greyhound (even more important now that there is no Greyhound!): easy to book, no fuss, simple check-in and no cost-hiking \"extras.\"Want to fly with just a backpack for the weekend? No problem - you'll save money. Don't want a \"complimentary\" pretzel snack? You don't have to pay for it. Don't care where you sit? Save again. These little things add up and can help make travel affordable again. Even under-a-hundred-bucks affordable.Europe's low-cost carrier pioneers had a smart formula: a single-aircraft fleet to simplify training and maintenance; eliminating \"free\" meals and all the infrastructure they required; ditto the expensive airport lounges; really focusing on logistics; and working with a non-unionized work force, making it more nimble and flexible. It revolutionized travel.Flair has been in Canada since 2005 but it's really been our last five years of aggressive makeover that have mattered. We emulated and Canadianized this European disruption formula and were instantly vaulted into #3 status in Canada. Over the last two years, the two big airlines dropped from over 80 per cent of market share to 69 per cent. There is clearly a hunger among Canadian consumers for doing flying differently.Opinion: Ottawa has 13% support on its oil and gas policies(https://financialpost.com/opinion/ottawa-oil-and-gas-policies)William Watson: We will need Trussonomics(https://financialpost.com/opinion/william-watson-trussonomics)Matthew Lau: Ottawa's woke plan for washroom equity(https://financialpost.com/opinion/matthew-lau-ottawa-woke-plan-washroom-equity)The early lessons: it doesn't have to cost more to visit your mom in Halifax that than it does to fly to Europe. And there's a viable alternative to the industry's overall hub-and-spoke rule that \"if you want to get there, you need to go through Toronto or Calgary first.\"The fact is, diversifying locations not only introduces more traveller choice; it also brings costs down. \"Airport improvement fees\" are typically between $30 and $35 per passenger in Canada's major hub airports. This charge obviously gets passed on to consumers as higher air fare.So while other airlines' economic model sees them retreating from Western Canada, the Maritimes and diverse Ontario locations, we are expanding. Last week, we launched three new routes - Kitchener/Waterloo to Abbotsford, Ottawa to Thunder Bay and Toronto to Kelowna. All direct. All low-cost. And with more to come.Are there more public-policy bugbears we should be thinking about? Yes. For instance, it's time we had a serious look at policies that prevent foreign carriers from moving passengers between two points in Canada, a piece of protectionism that discourages cross-border competition. Addressing that in Europe flipped the industry on its head and helped make air travel consumer-centric again.Though it may be immodest to say, the advent of a third national carrier focused emphatically on slashing the cost of air travel by doing things differently is a big first step in moving Canada to that same destination. Students should be able to afford to see mom for her birthday or spend Remembrance Day with granddad. And Canada is seeing the first disruptive steps to making that a reality.Stephen Jones is president and CEO of Flair Airlines. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved."
