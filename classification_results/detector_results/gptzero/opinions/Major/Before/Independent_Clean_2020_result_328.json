But why oh why did Boris Johnson allow this to happen, when anyone could have told him that a dysfunctional workforce is often the result of this type of behaviour.I would imagine now that bridges can be rebuilt and the necessary reforms implemented and I would suggest that these so-called mavericks, movers and shakers fully appreciate that this type of strategy often does morph into a self-defeating drizzle, not the catastrophic cloudburst they so agitated for.Judith A. DanielsNorfolkBroken promisesBoris Johnson’s green promiseswould be so very welcome if we could believe them. But this is the man who broke promises within months of making them, so how much faith can we put on targets set between 10 and 30 years hence?I'm waiting for the promises he will make to dig him out of the hole when the vaccine roll-out goes belly up: an end to world poverty within 50 years? Everlasting life from 2100? A new British Empire covering half the globe in a hundred years?Or maybe the promise will be realistic and more immediate: a new PM by the summer.Tim SidawayHertfordshireTime lostI can't say that I have feltbored over the past eight months or so.The time has passed remarkably quickly and we have frequently wondered where the days and weeks have gone. We have read more, but the shelves of unread books remain full. We have gone out less, for meals, theatre and concerts, so we must have watched more TV. The SkyBox has more storage space, as fewer new series have been made.We have a daily walk routine, introduced at the start of lockdown at the end of March, and that has reintroduced us to friends and neighbours who we have known for more than 40 years but lost touch with because of our former busy lives. On our walks we have become more acutely aware of the changes to the seasons in gardens and in hedgerows.We are fortunate baby boomers who had previously retired and developed interests, which we have been able to expand to fill the days in 2020. My wife paints. I'm a local historian.We go into town less. We get groceries delivered. We miss the hustle and bustle of market day, but most of all we miss the physical contact with our children and grandchildren. Time spent with them is lost forever.John E HarrisonLancashireMilitary jargonTwice recently I heard Mr Johnson refer to Mr Starmer’s fellow MPs as “troops”. Why does the PM persist in using outdated – even in his lifetime – military jargon? Cavalry, bugles, enemy, fight and, now, troops? What? Enough, for heaven’s sake!People are dying but not as a result of any military activity. They are dying because of thisgovernment’s incompetence. I guess it’s too late to ask Mr Johnson to put aside childish things, such as his toy soldiers?Beryl WallLondonRead MoreMarvel star Letitia Wright criticised for sharing anti-vaxx videoGreen plan brings ban on petrol and diesel cars forward to 2030Businesses call for more money to fund ‘disappointing’ green planHow to have an eco-friendly ChristmasPM will have to raise his game to ensure climate targets are met"
