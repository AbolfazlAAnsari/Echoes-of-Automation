But once that softening dynamic is put in motion, accidents can happen; what starts as a mild softening can easily morph into a more serious downturn.Even if a recession ensues, it will be mild compared to what happened four decades ago. In 1979,Paul Volckertook office as Fed chair amid an even worse outbreak of inflation than we're experiencing now. The public had been conditioned by the experience of the prior 15 years to expect inflation to be high and rising. Partly because of that conditioning, the cost of conquering inflation was tremendous. Volcker and his colleagues had to let theFed's policy ratego above 20% and tolerate anunemployment rateexceeding 10%.Progress against today's high inflation won't come as quickly as anyone wants. But a year from now, inflation will have come down substantially from its current level, and by two to three years from now, it should be in the neighborhood of 2%. Everyone will be a little less angry.In the meantime, if you listen to Fed Chair Jerome Powell carefully, you'll hear him invoke one name surprisingly frequently -Volcker, the patron saint of inflation control. There's a reason why he's doing that: If he can persuade the American people that he's serious about controlling inflation, his job will be a whole lot easier.In fact, his work may be mostly done already.Opinion by David Wilcox for CNN Business PerspectivesTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
