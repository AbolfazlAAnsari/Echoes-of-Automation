The trend is bad enough to havecaught the attention of the Federal Aviation Administrationand, for some particularly unruly passengers, theFederal Bureau of Investigation. As of Tuesday, the FAA had 1,150 reports of unruly passengers, from which744 were related to mask-wearing.Though the facts clearly demonstrate the prudence of delaying the end of the mask mandate, a choiceechoedby the ongoing airline chaos in Europe, I continue to worry that the CDC ultimately will be cornered into doing the wrong thing -- or forced to comply with the federal judge's latest ruling on the matter before the Biden administration can appeal.The country has slid into \"move on from Covid-19\" mode, embracing the magical thinking that, by ignoring the virus, it will go away, misconstruing our collective fatigue as an indication of finality. And the airplane tantrum reports, however despicable, are demoralizing somehow -- clear-cut evidence of a tattered social fabric. The path to a quieter summer -- at least in newspaper headlines -- is to look the other way and hope nothing disastrous happens.In this regard, it is unlikely that the wrong decision -- rescinding the mask mandate too soon -- will lead to any major health crisis. Yes, cases will increase, but with each new Covid-19 wave, believers in masks and vaccines have become shrewder as individuals and as a society at juggling safety and risk in our daily life.Plus, we have a pretty good level of community immunity and lots of vaccine and/or disease-induced protection against severe disease and death. The decision by the CDC will not send us back to square one.Should the CDC eventually move on from masks during travel even in the midst of uncertain containment of the virus, the assurance may be enough for many people to feel comfortable boarding an airplane without a mask. But if I fly anywhere in the next several months, first, I will do my own research by checking the CDC websiteshowing stateandcounty infection ratesand, if I don't like what the numbers show -- no matter what towns my new cabin-mates hail from -- I, happily, will once again don a mask.Opinion by Kent SepkowitzTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
