            "inputText": "By Dr. David ForrestI am a physician on the front lines taking care of COVID-19 patients and many who might have COVID-19. I am at risk of infection.You would think that I and others like me would be the first to get vaccinated. But like many of our nurses and respiratory therapists, we have been a lower priority than visitors to long-term care homes and staff not directly managing COVID-19 patients. Indeed, we received vaccinations recently only because an extra batch became available.But it's not just about risk to ourselves. It's about risk to others. I see immunocompromised patients and frail elderly. What if I have COVID-19 and I am asymptomatic but infectious?I am one of only eight ICU doctors, four each week covering two ICUs. My loss would seriously compromise our ability to manage our sickest patients. The same is true of nurses and respiratory therapists who treat COVID-19 patients: it doesn't matter how many ventilators you have if there are no staff to provide the care.And several hospitals - including my own - have suffered outbreaks, with transmission between staff and possibly from staff to patients.The vaccine is needed not just to end this pandemic but to preserve our health-care system. It must be managed meticulously.That is not easy. But we have had years to prepare. We knew vaccine was coming. Yet we seem unable to manage it effectively.Why has our leadership failed us?Medical staff prepare to turn an intubated COVID-19 patient in the ICU from her back to her stomach at the Toronto-area Humber River Hospital on Dec. 9, 2020.There have been many unproven therapies touted for COVID-19, many with biological plausibility. We committed not to offer treatments of unknown benefit and potential risk, except through clinical trials: we needed to determine if they work and are safe, rather than making well-intentioned but potentially harmful treatment decisions.The global medical community expedited high-quality research to establish evidence-based therapy for COVID-19. And to demonstrate the harm of others thought to hold promise.The vaccine saga has been even more amazing. We have developed vaccines of astonishing effectiveness with astounding speed, again proven in carefully designed scientific studies.Such accomplishments are testament to the wonder of modern medicine.It is especially troubling, then, that there is deviation from the evidence-based dosing of the vaccine: two doses 21 days apart with 95 per cent efficacy. But those given a first dose were booked for their second in 35 days or more. Now, they're not even being booked.The lack of prioritization to workers essential to prevent introduction of the virus to long-term facilities or to provide care to COVID-19 patients has meant this timeline cannot be met.I and my colleagues have struggled to ensure you have access to the best available treatment for this disease that is evidence-based. But there is no evidence that deviation from the vaccination protocol based on peer-reviewed study is safe or efficacious. And some evidence suggests delay risks waning immunity.In 1946, a study was initiated in Tuskegee, Ala., that described the natural history of syphilis. Participants were lured by the offer of free health care, but had no idea they were being studied and did not consent; they were not offered effective treatment with penicillin. This study remains one of the most notorious examples of unethical treatment of human subjects.We have no choice when we receive vaccination as to how it is administered. Consent is not obtained to deviate from the established scientifically proven dosing. We are not informed of the risks of so doing. Like the poor citizens of Tuskegee, we are subjects in a grand experiment without acquiescing and without alternative, with the promise of an intervention that can prevent a deadly disease as the carrot.A health-care worker prepares to administer a dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in Toronto on Dec. 14, 2020.At risk is not just the health of vaccine recipients, but sustainability of our health-care system.Those making these decisions may be well meaning, but what they are doing is unethical. It jeopardizes protection of those most at risk and most needed to provide health care. And if indeed less effective, it risks loss of faith in the vaccine, further eroding trust in Public Health.The COVID-19 pandemic is a crisis. It has brought out the best of medical science and the best in front-line workers who have not shied from their task to care for their neighbours.There is much to be desired about the management of the pandemic. But poor choices in vaccine prioritization and its unethical provision are especially egregious. Particularly when it comes to protecting those essential for your care, this must be corrected. Now. We all deserve better treatment.David Forrest is an Infectious Disease and Critical Care physician in Nanaimo, B.C.NP View: Liberal failures on vaccines will mean more COVID-19 deaths that should have been preventable(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/np-view-liberal-failures-on-vaccines-will-mean-more-covid-19-deaths-that-should-have-been-preventable)Kelly McParland: Not only have the Liberals failed us on obtaining vaccines, they won't even be honest about it(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/kelly-mcparland-not-only-have-the-liberals-failed-us-on-obtaining-vaccines-they-wont-even-be-honest-about-it) !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
