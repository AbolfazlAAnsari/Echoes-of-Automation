Pride in that work stayed with him all his life.Even though his work was voluntary, I agree with Dr. Holloway that a year of mandatory service in something like the C.C.C. would be a very good thing for the soul of America. It feels as though many people in our country, particularly our young, need help appreciating the most basic joy of work worth doing.Patricia McCordSahuarita, Ariz.To the Editor:The idea of national service for all young American citizens is a terrible idea. The terribleness starts with the word “compulsory.” Who is qualified to tell any other free citizens what they must do to improve themselves and their nation? The answer is no one, least of all an overreaching government.In many creative people, the years between 15 and 25 can bring a massive surge of energy. Some people, like Bob Dylan and Steve Jobs, boil over with a need to put that energy to work, and even college would hold them back. So, too, would a year of national service. Compulsory national service is one of those ideas that, if repeated enough, seems to make good sense, but it would actually be a disservice. We need to think long and hard and come up with better ways to mold citizens and the nation.Doug TerryOlney, Md.To the Editor:A national public service program for youths under the age of 25 could help unify Americans of different backgrounds. However, the responsibility of civilian service should not fall only on youths. Senior citizens can also play a vital role in bridging the divide.AmeriCorps Seniorsis a government program for volunteers aged 55 years and older to serve their communities. They foster victims of abuse, care for children with disabilities, provide job training, tutoring and mentoring, and help immunize children.In addition to providing needed services, AmeriCorps allows seniors to stay connected to others and have a purpose. In doing so, seniors can understand problems faced by people of different socioeconomic, racial and ethnic backgrounds. If not mandatory, public service by seniors could be encouraged, for example, by tax breaks, discounts in health premiums or modest stipends.After enduring a pandemic from which millions are still suffering financial and emotional losses, and a political climate that has threatened our social cohesion, now, more than ever, would be a good time to mandate or promote national public service.Eve RodlerOakland, Calif.To the Editor:I read Jonathan Holloway’s article with great interest and an uncharacteristic sense of optimism. As a retired educator, I have experienced how important and mind-altering it is to work face to face with people of differing abilities and challenges. This could be such a great opportunity for young people to broaden their life experiences. It could take advantage of their open hearts and minds.Perhaps these young people could see a concrete benefit, such as a year of college credit and/or valuable on-the-job training.Arlene OliverSetauket, N.Y.Climate Change: Time Is Running OutTo the Editor:On May 30 of this year, carbon dioxide levels at the measuring site atop Mauna Loa, in Hawaii, reached 420 parts per million, or 50 percent above the preindustrial level. Forty years have passed since The Times carriedan articlewarning of the grave risks of allowing carbon dioxide to exceed that level.The study covered in your article was issued by the Carter administration, in one of its last acts. It was widely appreciated four decades ago that climate protection required strong government action. Those of us working on the issue even knew enough to hazard a guess at an upper limit that should not be exceeded (though we were too lenient, later work would reveal).We have now had decades of gross dereliction of civic responsibility by the federal government, and greenhouse gases continue steadily to build in the atmosphere. We Americans are faced today with a great test of whether we care enough for our children to finally act. We will be late but at least not absent.James Gustave SpethStrafford, Vt.The writer was chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality in the Carter administration and is the author of the forthcoming book “They Knew: The U.S. Federal Government’s 50-Year Role in Causing the Climate Crisis.”Federal Aid for ‘Hamilton’?!To the Editor:Re “Lots of Benjamins for ‘Hamilton’: Musical Qualifies for Pandemic Relief Aid” (Arts pages, June 30), about at least $30 million in aid going to the show’s touring productions:How can a producer of a musical be so tone deaf? Jeffrey Seller’s equating grants given to “Hamilton” to the bailout of the auto companies only illustrated his inability to “read the room.”It’s impossible for all assistance legislation to restrict payments to those truly in need, but those who don’t have a need can eliminate themselves. For example, many retired people who didn’t need assistance received federal coronavirus relief payments, but turned around those payments and contributed to charities such as food banks.Shame on these producers who have made a fortune and will continue to make a fortune from this wonderful show.Thomas SchneiderOceanside, Calif.PHOTO:    (PHOTOGRAPH BY Damon Winter/The New York Times FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
