Isn't that \"following the science\"?In addition an apology is owed to Sadiq Khan, who wanted face masks to be compulsory on London's public transport network in April but was derided by the government. One could so easily despair.Beryl Wall                                          London W4Rules be rules (or should be)\"If you don't follow the rules, the police will have the powers to enforce them,\" was the prime minister's warning, on 23 March. Now we know that appetite for enforcement did not extend to a certain political adviser to the PM, yet it certainly now includes anyone who wants to make a protest. Whilst the word unprecedented is very frequently used (ironically), this laissez faire set of rules is now unenforceable, so is unlawful.Stuart Wilkie                                          Kings LynnLeaders are insulated from economic painThe World Bank president has described the economic effects of the pandemic as \"devastating\". However, I have not heard a single one of the key decision makers - politicians and senior civil servants all - suggest that they personally should incur any economic cost.May I suggest that the Office for National Statistics establish the average percentage loss of income and pension entitlement suffered this year by the average Briton and then impose that cut on the decision makers. This would expose them to the financial aspect of the decisions they are making. Those decision makers may have wonderful imaginations and great empathy - but there is nothing like personal experience to build understanding.Bob Grayson                                          Sheffield"
