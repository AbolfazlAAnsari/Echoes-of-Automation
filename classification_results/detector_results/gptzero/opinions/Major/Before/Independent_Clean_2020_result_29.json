How is this going to bring the country together? Can she not understand that, like the UK's desire to leave the EU, the SNP merely wants to take back control and stop decisions about our country being made in a distant and unrepresentative legislature?Geoff Forward                                          StirlingMEPs sing Auld Lang Syne as Brexit deal is approved in EU ParliamentCost-cuttingSo Boris Johnsonwantsto cull \"poor-value\" projects. May I suggest that he starts by putting his money where his mouth is: cutting the £300 per day members receive for an afternoon snooze in the House of Lords, sleeping off a subsidised lunch, would be a start.​David Hooley                                          Newmarket, CambridgeshireNorthern failThat Northern Rail is losing its franchise is great news: it shows how good the franchise system is for passengers. The government is able and willing to act on our behalf; but when the government owns and runs the rail system, no customer can challenge the incompetent. Too many people forget just how excruciatingly bad British Rail was, and how impossible it was to do anything about it.Steve Hills​                                          Milton Keynes"
