We will make every effort to hold this government to account, for their sake.We implore you to be honest about the problems our NHS is facing, and take urgent action to restore it to good health. It is not too late to make amends.âTom Gardiner,                     doctor                                          John Puntis,                     consultant paediatrician                                          Peter Barton,                     clinical nurse specialist                                          Marie Louise Irvine,                     general practitioner                                          Joy Inns,                     doctor                                          Hannah Golden,                      trainee psychologist                                          Lopa Banerjee,                     medical student                                          Nick Mann,                     general practitioner                                          Margaret O'Connor,                     health visitor                                          Richard Hall,                      trainee clinical psychologistFor the full list of 600 NHS staff members who have signed this letter,see hereJeremy Corbyn challenges Boris Johnson on the NHSScotland's returnIt is apt that the EU parliament sang Auld Lang Syne to mark the UK's departure.We Scots voted to remain but were denied by Westminster.

How is this going to bring the country together? Can she not understand that, like the UK's desire to leave the EU, the SNP merely wants to take back control and stop decisions about our country being made in a distant and unrepresentative legislature?Geoff Forward                                          StirlingMEPs sing Auld Lang Syne as Brexit deal is approved in EU ParliamentCost-cuttingSo Boris Johnsonwantsto cull \"poor-value\" projects. May I suggest that he starts by putting his money where his mouth is: cutting the Â£300 per day members receive for an afternoon snooze in the House of Lords, sleeping off a subsidised lunch, would be a start.âDavid Hooley                                          Newmarket, CambridgeshireNorthern failThat Northern Rail is losing its franchise is great news: it shows how good the franchise system is for passengers. The government is able and willing to act on our behalf; but when the government owns and runs the rail system, no customer can challenge the incompetent. Too many people forget just how excruciatingly bad British Rail was, and how impossible it was to do anything about it.Steve Hillsâ                                          Milton Keynes"
