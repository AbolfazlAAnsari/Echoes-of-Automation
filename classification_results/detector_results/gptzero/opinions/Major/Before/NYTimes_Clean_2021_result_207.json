Even though the migrants have not harmed the ranchers (and could work as low-wage workers), the ranchers lock their doors and are armed.When did we become so cold that we demonize our fellow humans? My heart bleeds for the migrants, who deserve a chance to live.Leslie EbertCatonsville, Md.The writer is a licensed social worker.A Reason for Santa ClausTo the Editor:I was saddened to read “Is Santa Real? Bishop Delivers Hard Truths to Young Flock” (Italy Dispatch, Dec. 15).When we teach children to read at an early age, we instill in them a function of imagery. It is part of cerebral development. Santa Claus is an innocent form of imagery. It didn’t do any of us harm to imagine that there is someone out there who is kind and considerate of “good little boys and girls.”Why does anyone want to deprive children of this fleeting venture at a time when they have to develop imagination? Just think: It was a good opportunity to teach that someone knows if “you’ve been bad or good.”Goodbye to Santa Claus, imagination and morality.Ernest G.
