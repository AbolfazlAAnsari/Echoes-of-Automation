            "inputText": "In Monday's mini-budget, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland threw so many numbers at us - with so many zeroes after them - that Canadians might be forgiven for missing some important announcements. So here's one number to bear in mind: $97.6 billion. That's the new projected cost of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) through next June. CEWS is now the largest component of Ottawa's pandemic response, outstripping even the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and its successors. And we don't really know what this massive program is buying us.CEWS has been paying up to 75 per cent of wage costs for over 300,000 businesses that have lost revenue during the pandemic. Unlike CERB, those payments go to businesses, not directly to workers who have been laid off in the pandemic.The idea behind CEWS could make sense. By lowering the cost of retaining workers for struggling businesses, the program should help reduce unemployment and keep incomes flowing. But at what cost? The problem is that CEWS payments are paid for all workers at affected businesses, not just those facing the prospect of earnings losses. Most of those jobs would still exist, even if the program were cancelled. That makes CEWS a very expensive way to protect vulnerable workers. It would be better to wind this program down and target the funds to help those workers and business owners who need it most.Bureaucrats in Ottawa seem to recognize that CEWS is costly and ineffective. In September, subsidy rates were cut for most applicants, and the program was scheduled to wind up by the end of this year. But, as Milton Friedman said, \"there is nothing so permanent as a temporary government program.\" Business groups objected to the cuts and pushed back hard(https://businessexaminer.ca/victoria-articles/item/cfib-cews-ceba-and-cers-extended-until-june-2021-with-changes/) against the government's plans. And so the government blinked, and subsidy rates were increased again, while the program was extended to next June at least.Terence Corcoran: Canada's cost of pandemonics tops $1.5 trillion(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-canadas-cost-of-pandemonics-tops-1-5-trillion)Terence Corcoran: The Great Reset and the COVID pandemic(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-the-great-reset-and-the-covid-pandemic)Terence Corcoran: Thou shalt not kill the economy(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-thou-shalt-not-kill-the-economy-the-troubling-moral-premise-behind-the-zero-covid-lockdowns)Aaron Wudrick: Chrystia Freeland comes bearing good news(https://financialpost.com/opinion/aaron-wudrick-chrystia-freeland-comes-bearing-good-news)But in fact, the September reforms made sense. The cost of the program dropped, with very little effect on unemployment. That tells us that CEWS is not meeting its objective of saving jobs in a cost-effective way. In a recent study for the Finances of the Nation project(https://financesofthenation.ca/ ), I estimated that each job saved through CEWS is costing the federal government more than $175,000 annually. That is state capitalism on a truly grand scale, and too high a price to pay.CEWS funds don't go directly to workers, and they are not saving many jobs. Instead, they end up in business profits. That could help the hardest-hit businesses weather the storm of the COVID crisis. But here, too, CEWS does not effectively target those most in need. Last week, we learned of one large retailer(https://www.thestar.com/business/opinion/2020/11/23/leons-received-almost-30-million-in-government-handouts-now-its-posting-record-profits-and-boosting-the-amount-it-pays-to-shareholders.html) that in effect used its CEWS payments to fund a special dividend to shareholders this year. Some other countries have banned extraordinary payouts to managers and shareholders by companies taking wage supports. That is a sign of how controversial these massive wage subsidies are.CEWS is not just expensive, it could actually delay the recovery. Under current rules, as business revenues recover to pre-pandemic levels, their CEWS payments automatically decline. For a typical retail business, a $1,000 increase in revenues now means a reduction in CEWS payments of about $320. That's a 32 per cent tax rate on revenues that struggling businesses must pay, in addition to their normal business taxes. It's a \"welfare wall\" businesses must climb as they grow their businesses this year and next.Other countries have recognized the problems with their pandemic wage subsidies and have made reforms. The United States offered similar support in the spring through the Paycheck Protection Program, albeit only to smaller businesses. Researchers found(http://economics.mit.edu/files/20094) it had virtually no impact on employment(https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tracker_paper.pdf), and it has since been wound up. Ireland and Australia operated similar wage subsidies in the early months of the pandemic. Both countries reduced subsidies and tightened eligibility in September and, unlike Canada, they have stuck to the plan. The result is programs that are more cost-effective and better targeted to the hardest-hit businesses.Most European countries do not offer general wage subsidies to businesses at all. Instead, they offer \"job retention\" schemes that encourage employers to put workers on short hours instead of laying them off. That targets assistance to the jobs that are most at risk, exactly as Canada should be doing.A few weeks ago, Finance Minister Freeland praised the European approach(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-12/trudeau-s-finance-minister-praises-germany-s-short-work-program), calling it \"something that Canada should be paying a lot of attention to.\" Will something like it be coming to Canada soon?Michael Smart is a professor of economics at the University of Toronto and co-director of FinancesoftheNation.ca.(https://financesofthenation.ca/ ) !@COPYRIGHT=© 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.
