Overly strict regulations may actually increase health risk since, for example, it is illegal to sell cannabis using the same safe propellant formulation used in medical inhalers. Allowing more THC (the chemical that makes you high) in edibles would help nudge people away from smoking or inhaling and towards ingesting, which is less risky. In the 15 U.S. states that have legalized recreational cannabis, THC limits for edibles are normally 10 times what is permitted in Canada.Another key issue is wasted opportunity in cannabinol (CBD), a non-intoxicating chemical found in cannabis plants, including legal hemp, that is popular in wellness products around the world. At the moment, we regulate CBD almost as strictly as we do THC. For example, only cannabis-licensed producers can make CBD products of any type; CBD can only be sold in cannabis stores; and CBD exports and imports are only allowed for medical use. In the U.S., by contrast, CBD is much less regulated: farmers, producers and retailers can handle pure CBD freely. Health Canada held consultations on this issue in 2019. But progress has since stalled: a science committee the department formed has met only twice, and not at all this year, according to a government website.Other issues that need to be tackled are: barriers to Indigenous involvement in the cannabis industry; a one-size-fits-all excise duty that negatively impacts small craft growers; production red tape (e.g., not being able sell six packs of cannabis drinks and needing a federally security-cleared person on-site for cannabis production); and a general lack of accountability and service standards at Health Canada.Not addressing these problems, which may be a temptation for a new government with a full plate, will result in an industry that can't keep up with the black market and a regulatory framework that becomes an example of how not to effectively regulate cannabis. Canada took a brave first step in legalizing cannabis. It now needs to follow through to ensure success.Financial PostShane Morris runs a global cannabis consultancy. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved."
