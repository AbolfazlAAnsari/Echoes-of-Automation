Is God involved?Chris HoldenBristolTrucked offThe treatment of the lorry drivers at Dover is yet another disgraceful indictment of our government’s handling of both Covid and Brexit.The late announcement of the variant Covid virus was mismanagement of the highest order and started the port crisis. The Brexit lack of preparedness at the port itself was in full public gaze. Our esteemed ministers have been telling us for months how well prepared we are for the end of the transition period. If this was the case, even the most basic of contingency plans would have considered the welfare of the truck drivers, so it does smack of the usual lies that emanate from this bunch.Reporters have described the conditions for the truckers as horrendous. I am not surprised to see their frustration turn to anger. These key essential workers are now just festive pawns in a political game between UK and France. Tut tut to both nations in the season of goodwill.Paul MorrisonGlasgowVaccine priorityUnless I have missed something in the past couple of days, Arthur Walmsley’s letter ('Our flawed vaccination policy’, 23 December) shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what the vaccine can achieve, as did Tony Blair’s recent article ('We are in a race against time – we must change our vaccine policy now', 23 December).My understanding is that there is so far no evidence that the vaccine stops or reduces transmission of the virus to other people; it just stops the vaccinated person becoming ill. The plan of vaccinating those at schools and colleges first would therefore simply provide protection for those that are much less likely to become seriously ill anyway – but still leave their more vulnerable parents and grandparents just as exposed to infection from them as they are now.John MansfordPrestonBlundering BorisI have just finished reading Patrick Cockburn’s article, ‘Boris Johnson is as incompetent as General Haig at the Somme – the price is 50,000 unnecessary deaths this year’ (18 December).Unfortunately, this strikes me as absolutely true, a shocking indictment of a shambolic and corrupt government. However, like the bankers of the 2008 financial crash, they will undoubtedly get away with it. Completely wrong, but completely inevitable.Kevin AldersonAddress suppliedLetter to SantaDear Santa,It's nearly 70 years since I last wrote to you with a request for a Christmas present, so I hope you have not been offended by my silence.All these years later, my request is not just for myself, but for all we poor sufferers putting up with the buffoons, liars and incompetents operating under the guise of our “government”. Can you please give us a special gift this year, and arrange for replacements?I know we have had this “present” for more than a year, and have had multiple opportunities to request a replacement during that time, but our minds have been distracted. Now it seems beyond all hope of repair. Please help.Sandra KellyWorthingRead MoreIndependent schools responded with alacrity on matters regarding racePM’s response to closure of French border highlights weaknessesThe 20 best Christmas films of all time – ranked"
