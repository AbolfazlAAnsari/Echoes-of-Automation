            "inputText": "During last fall's election campaign, while the Bank of Canada's mandate was under review, the prime minister made the perplexing claim that he \"doesn't think about monetary policy.\" Even so, his re-elected government renewed the central bank's inflation target at the two per cent midpoint of a one to three per cent band. But the latest data(https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/220316/dq220316a-eng.htm) tell us inflation is now running at 5.7 per cent. That's the highest we've seen it since the early 1990s, and it's rising. The problem it poses is real, pressing and getting worse.The government says inflation is a \"global problem,\" and it's true that most advanced economies are also experiencing rising prices. But that's because they're all following the same hyper-expansionary policies. Our own inflation is a creation of the Bank of Canada. The chart shows CPI inflation, as well as the growth of two definitions of the money supply (M1+ and M2++) over the last decade. Money growth was steady for much of the period but began creeping up in the middle of 2019 and has since grown explosively as the bank and the government worked to prevent a severe economic downturn. Although their growth has tapered off, these aggregates are still growing at extraordinary rates. For example, M1+, which is currency held by the public and all chequable deposits at financial institutions, is still growing at a jaw-dropping 14 per cent.To put that in perspective: to maintain an inflation rate around two per cent and allow a bit of a margin to prevent deflation, the money supply should grow at five to six per cent per year. We are currently way above that. Meanwhile, the current policy interest rate is at just 0.5 per cent, well below even the most conservative estimates of the \"neutral\" rate - the rate consistent with full employment and stable inflation, which the bank estimates to be 1.75 to 2.75 per cent. Conclusion? Monetary policy is highly inflationary right now.South of the border, after hedging its bets for the last year, the U.S. Federal Reserve has begun an aggressive raising of rates. Last week, the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policymaking body, raised(https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/fed-rate-hike-1.6387065?__vfz=medium=sharebar) the policy rate to 0.5 per cent, and it has promised seven more rate hikes, with the goal of getting to 2.8 per cent by late next year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said(https://www.ft.com/content/0f7945f5-b269-4d13-9151-c1ac9ec6fddc) he is \"acutely aware of the need to return the economy to price stability and determined to use our tools to do exactly that.\"That U.S. inflation is running hotter than ours, at 7.9 per cent, is no reason for complacency. Unfortunately, Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem was vague in his comments(https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/03/opening-statement-030322/) March 3 before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance. Commenting on the previous day's rate hike, he made no specific commitment regarding future hikes; nor did he commit to begin ending quantitative easing by reducing the bank's holding of government bonds.Vivek Dehejia: Inflation should worry the left, too(https://financialpost.com/opinion/vivek-dehejia-inflation-should-worry-the-left-too)Opinion: Economics loses a Wunderkind and prophet(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-economics-loses-a-wunderkind-and-prophet)Terence Corcoran: Budget pacto rescues Liberals from crisis(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-budget-pacto-rescues-liberals-from-crisis)Governor Macklem did say \"the bank is determined to control inflation.\" But it is hard to understand how a policy stance that is clearly still inflationary will allow it to hit its target. The danger of moving too slowly is that high inflation gets baked into people's expectations, thereby setting up a wage-price spiral reminiscent of the \"stagflation\" that bedevilled the 1970s.Canada most recent bout of high and persistent inflation was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was only tamed by double-digit interest rates under then-Governor John Crow. Crow was widely pilloried for the hardship his policy caused but, with the Mulroney government's support, the disinflation succeeded. The tough medicine allowed a re-anchoring of the public's expectations, thus setting up our current era of two per cent inflation targeting.Today, no more than in the late 1980s, there is no room for complacency. The Bank of Canada needs to get serious about reducing inflation and the Trudeau government needs to get behind it.Vivek Dehejia teaches economics at Carleton University.
