            "inputText": "Pandemic response Poll ratings are rising and falling based on COVID-19 management. That's why the Morrison government must throw everything into rolling out the vaccine as fast as possible.Political commentary in Australia is dominated by party politics. Every decision by the government is analysed in terms of its electoral impact. And then every fortnight or so opinion polls are published and commentators judge the winners and losers.There's endless analysis about who is winning and losing in day-to-day politics even if the election is years away. It's not necessarily very enlightening. It would make more sense for there to be constant analysis of the efficacy of government policies rather than an analysis of whether those policies will win or lose an election.These days, commentators are saying the Morrison government is heading for electoral defeat because of its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Well, the election, I would guess, is still around nine months away, and a lot will happen in that time.What has happened elsewhere in the world is illustrative of the electoral impact of the pandemic. Donald Trump lost the 2020 election because of his clumsy and erratic rhetoric about COVID-19. The rollout of the vaccine didn't come soon enough to save him. In the UK, Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party have seen their poll ratings rise and fall depending on their responses to the pandemic.In Europe, Angela Merkel and her party have seen their ratings rise and fall and rise again according to their management of the pandemic. The same is true for President Emmanuel Macron in France.So back to Australia. In the early stages of the gilded-cage strategy, the public rallied behind Scott Morrison and his government. But then the state premiers started pursuing their quixotic COVID-19 elimination strategies - which are unsustainable and, as you can now see, are doomed to fail.The relatively slow rollout of the vaccine, the constant lockdowns and the never-ending dramatic reports of COVID-19 infections have created a political headache for the federal government. It has to be said that for the traditional Liberal voter it's hard to accept that the government they voted for constricts people's freedoms and goes on a spending spree the likes of which none of us has seen before. It's hard to swallow.A handful have said they will not vote Liberal at the next election. One of those is the former Queensland premier Campbell Newman. I must say, I find it a bit hard to sympathise with him. His mother and father would never have become ministers had it not been for the Liberal Party, and nor would he have become the premier of Queensland and the lord mayor of Brisbane without the endorsement of the Liberal Party. I might be wrong, but when the election comes, I doubt Newman will trouble the scorer.So let's face it, these are troubled times for the Morrison government, and I don't expect its position to look pretty in the next round of opinion polls. That means we are about to get a flurry of commentary about the end of the Morrison government and the kind of PM Anthony Albanese will make.Well, nearly every election in Australia is closely fought and either of the main political parties always has a chance of winning. The Liberal Party could win the next election, but it depends on three things.First, it has to throw everything at getting the vaccine rolled out as fast as humanly possible. Converting sports grounds and other facilities to vaccination centres, getting as many medical professionals as possible to administer the vaccinations, and encouraging the community by telling them that the double vaccination will free them of lockdown constraints should ensure that most Australians are vaccinated by late this year. If 80 per cent of adults are vaccinated that will be a great achievement.Once a large percentage of the public is vaccinated, the vulnerable are protected, families spread around the country and abroad are able to reunite and the state premiers can administer lockdowns only at their own cost, the public will forget the limitations of the present.It does need to be told, however, that the elimination of COVID-19 in Australia is not possible. There will always be some cases, and occasionally people will die with it. That is unavoidable and politicians should be honest with the public and ensure they understand that.It is completely dishonest to suggest that COVID-19 can be eliminated. And just as the government cannot guarantee people will not die from a range of ailments and accidents, no government can be sure that people will not die from COVID-19 or with it. Indeed, it doesn't matter who you vote for: we're all going to die in the end!The second requirement for a re-elected Morrison government is for it to lead the way on fiscal consolidation. At the moment, both major parties favour a massive spending spree. This risks inflation, rising interest rates and crippling defaults on loans and mortgages.Australia has been pursuing South American economics for the past 18 months, and we all know where that leads.The Liberal Party needs to have a face-to-face fierce debate with the Labor Party over public finances.The public knows there is a limit to government spending and that to go beyond the limit will destroy the economy. The government needs to define that limit and control the debate about fiscal consolidation and responsibility.Third, the Liberal Party needs to recapture the spirit of entrepreneurship, individual freedom and personal responsibility. It needs to make sure Australia has a competitive tax system and the labour market works efficiently.But government is not just about economics, and at times the Liberal Party has sounded as though that was all that mattered to it. It has to outline its broad philosophical direction - to ensure the public knows what it is about and what it aspires to achieve.Understandably, at the moment it looks as though it is preoccupied with fixing the COVID-19 problem. But by the end of the year, Morrison should be talking about his vision for a post-pandemic Australia.There will be many events that will batter the government over the next nine months, but if it gets these three things right it might just win the next election. After all, Albanese is a good bloke but he doesn't look like a prime minister.Alexander Downer was Australia's longest serving foreign minister, from 1996 to 2007, and most recently Australian high commissioner to the UK."
