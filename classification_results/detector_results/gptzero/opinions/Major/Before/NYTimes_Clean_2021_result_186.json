She didn’t put her son up for adoption because “I couldn’t imagine growing a baby inside my body, giving birth to it and then handing it over to someone else.” She chose to become a parent. But her life was still profoundly impacted by perceiving, at least then, that abortion was not an option. As she puts it:I want to report from the other side of a decision many people make and say: Yes, it can be true that you will love the child if you don’t have the abortion. It’s also true that whatever you thought would be so hard about having that child, whatever made you consider not having a child at that point in your life, may be exactly as hard as you thought it would be. As undesirable, as challenging, as painful as you feared.It has been so hard to decide to say these things, but I have to stand up for my 19-year-old self. I didn’t abort the pregnancy I didn’t plan, but I did have to abort the life I imagined for myself.

But I’m grateful to have this reporting to remind me that these deadly and horrible events are rare, even though they’ve come to feel routine, and despite being reminded of The Onion’s macabre joke headline: “‘No Way to Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens.”Tiny VictoriesParenting can be a grind. Let’s celebrate the tiny victories.My 5-year-old always wants to stay cozy in bed, and it has been hard to get her up for school as it gets colder. One morning, I put a blow dryer inside her clothes before putting them on her, and told her we need to “Quick, put them on before we lose the warm!” Now she dashes out of bed to get her clothes on. Not sure what I’m going to do when the season changes again, but for now our cold mornings are hacked!— Devon Berkshire, Greenwood Lake, N.Y.If you want a chance to get your Tiny Victory published, find us on Instagram@NYTparentingand use the hashtag #tinyvictories;email us; or enter yourTiny Victory at the bottom of this page.
