Queen's Park already has all the authority it needs over housing supply. The Housing Affordability Task Force(https://www.ontario.ca/page/housing-affordability-task-force-report#:~:text=The%20Task%20Force%20report%20is,and%20get%20homes%20built%20faster. ) the Ontario government struck late last year presented concrete examples of provincial legislation that could meaningfully move the dial on housing supply. For example, the province has within its power the ability to end exclusionary zoning provincewide by allowing up to four units and four storeys on each single-family lot \"as of right\" (without any legal or regulatory hurdles).So then, why introduce the current \"strong mayor\" legislation at all? Frankly, it seems like buck passing. Giving mayors the power to enforce provincial priorities (if they want) seems like a way of potentially getting more housing approved without the province having to make tough political decisions. But it's far from a guarantee.Local governments, like provincial governments, respond to their constituents' priorities in order to get elected and stay elected. Since city councillors have strong incentives(https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674015951) to block projects their constituents may not like and less reason to care about city or region-wide housing prices, council can become a major roadblock to housing construction. Shifting more power to mayors could conceivably tilt decisions in a more pro-housing direction, since, unlike councillors, they represent the whole city rather than one particular community. Mayors don't have the luxury of opposing new housing in one ward and vaguely committing to allow housing in other, more \"suitable\" parts of the city. But they still don't have strong incentives to ensure there is enough housing to accommodate prospective citizens.Rather than assign mayors new powers in hopes that they might steer new bylaws toward provincial goals, the province has the ability to act immediately and on a broader scale. There's no reason why it couldn't follow its counterpart in Nova Scotia(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-want-to-boost-housing-supply-look-to-nova-scotia) and make these decisions at the ministerial level to ensure that local land-use policies are congruent with provincial housing priorities.The provincial government represents all Ontarians - including those priced out of expensive housing markets like Toronto and Ottawa. Given that it has provincewide housing targets it has pledged to meet, it should be willing to take matters into its own hands. The province has constitutional authority over municipalities and land use, and better incentives than municipal politicians do to ensure that enough housing is built. It should use that authority rather than delegating it.It's possible that the proposed new mayoral system will help get some more housing built in the province's most expensive cities. But Ontario needs to act fast if there is any chance of meeting the provincial government's housing targets. At this point, there's little reason to believe that this will be achievable at the municipal level. It's time for the Ford government to bring down the hammer.Special to National PostSteve Lafleur is a public policy analyst and Josef Filipowicz is an urban policy specialist. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
