You cansign up hereto receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays.Two days after the fragile peace holding the country’s progressive coalition togethercollapsed on national television, a number of questions remain: Did Bernie Sanders really tell Elizabeth Warren in a private meeting in 2018 that a woman couldn’t win the presidency? Did Ms. Warren’s campaign deliberately leak this unverifiable story 13 months after the fact in an effort to undermine Mr. Sanders? Why is John Delaney still running? The world may never know.But what the world lacks in knowledge it more than makes up for in opinion. Here’s how people are responding to the dust-up and the larger conversation about sexism in politics.‘A self-fulfilling prophecy’Whether Mr. Sanders did or didn’t say what Ms. Warren remembers him saying is beside the point,writes Rebecca Traister, which is that there are “complicated, painful, difficult dynamics that have kept women from the presidency for the country’s entire history.” One of those dynamics, she argues, is how even talking about the fact of sexism becomes a trap for women, one that Ms. Warren had, until recently, avoided.Worth noting: As the Times columnistFrank Bruni has pointed out, and as Mr. Sanders himself said in Tuesday’s debate, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016 by nearly three million votes. And when it comes to swing states, “there’s no empirical evidence that you could lump in a whole region and say that women have not, or will not, fare well there,” the political scientistKelly Dittmar told Vox’s Li Zhou.•At the same time, 8 percent of Americans say they would not vote for a woman, according toa 2015 Gallup poll.•Men and women alike experience “feelings of moral outrage,” such as contempt, anger and disgust, when told a female politician is ambitious, according to researchMichelle Cottle cites in The Times.At the same time, 8 percent of Americans say they would not vote for a woman, according toa 2015 Gallup poll.Men and women alike experience “feelings of moral outrage,” such as contempt, anger and disgust, when told a female politician is ambitious, according to researchMichelle Cottle cites in The Times.So it is not sexist, Ms. Traister writes, to acknowledge, as Mr. Sanders says he remembers doing, that female candidates face a “real-life, genuine set of challenges.” But the discourse of “electability,” she adds, can also end up buttressing the same sexist reality that it means to condemn: “If we worry so much about whether we can elect a woman that it guides our choices, what we get is self-fulfilling prophecy, a future that looks like our past.”There are nuanced, difficult conversations to be had about what it means to have a woman running again,writes Bridget Read, but they’re not the ones actually being had. “Instead, the topic was wielded as a cudgel, hijacked for maximum provocation,” she writes. “Meanwhile, the terrifying factions of people who don’t want women anywhere near the halls of power, who don’t want anything to change, are patting themselves on the back somewhere, thrilled that we’re doing their work for them.\"“Wanting a woman to rise to the top of an almost all-male pack is not a position that needs defending,”writes Brittney Cooper, a Rutgers professor. “What should be defended is the uncritical desire to elect yet another man to a position that 45 men and zero women have held.”‘Bernie Boneheads and Liz Losers Unite!’It’s probable that neither Mr. Sanders nor Ms. Warren is lying,tweeted the lawyer and author Rabia Chaudry. “His comment likely had a particular context, and she heard it in a particular way. This is literally how human interaction often works when people end up with misunderstandings,” she wrote.Given the impossibility of determining what happened during the meeting, the internecine conflict can only hurt the progressive movement,argues Eric Levitz, for three reasons:•“There are not very many people in this country who are eager to spend copious amounts of time, money and attention on progressive politics.”•\"There are not very many politicians in America who are as responsive to the demands and desires of such people as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.”•“As a consequence of the first two points, Bernie and Warren supporters cannot win much of anything without each other.\"“There are not very many people in this country who are eager to spend copious amounts of time, money and attention on progressive politics.”\"There are not very many politicians in America who are as responsive to the demands and desires of such people as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.”“As a consequence of the first two points, Bernie and Warren supporters cannot win much of anything without each other.\"The labor leader Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-C.W.A., took a similar line. “These new hostilities have been needled and fostered by people who want to maintain control in this current system,”she told Sam Adler-Bellat The Intercept. “Stop beating up on each other, figure out how to find common ground, and get back to talking about the issues that matter, like health care, the dignity of all work and the existential threat of climate crisis.”The candidates, however, have not offered a sterling example of solidarity,writes Amy Davidson Sorkinin The New Yorker. During the debate, a CNN moderator appeared to blatantly side with Ms. Warren’s version of events after Mr. Sanders denied it. At that point, “it was not Warren’s job, of course, to be conciliatory, when Sanders himself had said that her account was false,” Ms. Davidson Sorkin writes. At the same time, his own account of the meeting did offer Warren “an opening that she shut off.”The biggest beneficiary of this rift is Joe Biden,writes Arwa Mahdawi. “He’s doing to his best to stay out of the news, as much as his gaffes will allow, and to maintain his front-runner status.”The Times reporter Astead Herndon alsopointed out on Twitter:‘A credibility issue’“This controversy has resurfaced some of Mr. Sanders’s past women troubles,” writes Ms. Cottle. She notes that his 2016 campaign staff faced sexual harassment allegations, which last year he said he was too busy to notice but recently,in an interview in The Times,he declared “disgusted” him. “It also doesn’t help that the Bernie Bros, a segment of Mr. Sanders’s most animated supporters, are famous for their aggressive, at times abusive, behavior toward his opponents and critics, earning a reputation for toxic machismo,” she adds.The writerMoira Donegan explicitly linkedthe rhetoric some of Mr. Sanders’s supporters have used about Ms. Warren to that used against victims of sexual assault:But many on the left have taken issue with the comparison, including The Times writer Elizabeth Bruenig, a supporter of Mr. Sanders. “I’m not a Bernie Bro, I’m an adult woman who has dealt with sexism and misogyny in my personal life and in my professional life,” she wrote in a since deleted tweet. “I don’t appreciate its cynical deployments, and I especially detest the exploitation of rhetoric around sexual assault in this context.”“Warren has a credibility issue, and it’s not sexist to point that out,”wrote Rebecca Nagle, a writer and member of the Cherokee nation, bringing up Ms. Warren’s false claims of Cherokee heritage (for which she has since apologized).Ms. Nagle tweeted:Do you have a point of view we missed?

[The Washington Examiner]WHAT YOU’RE SAYINGHere’s what readers had to say about the last edition:The “very male, very white” Oscar nominations.Stu from Brooklyn: “Fault movie executives for spending so little time and money greenlighting original projects that would appeal to intelligent viewers of all races and ethnicities. Oscar voters have, on the other hand, generally done their best with the material they’ve been offered for year-end appraisal.”Amberlee from Los Angeles (via email): “In addition to Lupita Nyong’o and Greta Gerwig, another major snub this year, in my opinion, is Taron Egerton’s exclusion from the nominations. … As exclusive as the Academy is toward women and people of color, let’s not forget it is equally exclusive toward L.G.B.T.Q.+ people and stories. The only queer people the Academy likes are those that die from AIDS or are murdered at the end of the film.”Roger from Connecticut (via email): “The most glaring omission from the list of directors is the name of Chinonye Chukwu for ‘Clemency,&#39; an important and extremely difficult topic handled with great expertise. … Greta Gerwig’s ‘Little Women’ was O.K. but hardly of any great import.”PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Illustration by The New York Times; photographs by Tamir Kalifa and Jordan Gale for The New York Times FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
