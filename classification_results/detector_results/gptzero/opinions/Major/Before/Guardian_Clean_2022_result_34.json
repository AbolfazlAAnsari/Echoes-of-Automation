Alito's hollow promise brings to mind similar assurances in notorious cases likeBush v Gore, is inconsistent withhow the judicial process works, and wouldn't offer any solace to anyone who might become pregnant or whose miscarriage might be treated as acrime scene for police to investigate.The foolishness of the argument that there's nothing to see here other than the future of abortion law is underscored by some of what is said in its support.We're toldnot to worry about the future of decisions likeLoving v Virginia, ensuring the right to marry someone of a different race than your own because, after all, Justice Clarence Thomas is in an interracial marriage. We're told not to worry about the right to same-sex marriage because, after all, Justice Brett Kavanaugh would never vote to overturnObergefell v Hodges, the most iconic opinion written by his proud mentor, Anthony Kennedy - the man who left the court only after he hadhand-picked Kavanaughas his successor. We're told not to worry about contraception (despite the wayquite a few people view Plan B or IUDs as forms of abortion) because even supreme court nominees like Amy Coney Barrett, who were cagey about just how \"settled\" a precedent they deemedRoe v Wade, said theycouldn't imagineanybody today challengingGriswold v Connecticut.  All that prognostication is cold comfort to the millions of people whose lives are profoundly affected by these shaky predictions.The most substantial argument is one that is equally fallacious but more sophisticated and in some ways more devious and dangerous: it isthe argumentthat supreme court reversals of precedent, like the reversal ofPlessy v FergusonbyBrown v Board of Education, are often to be welcomed as needed course corrections, and that this \"course correction\"wouldn't be the first timethe supreme court has rolled back decades-old constitutional rights. Themanycommentatorswho persisted in describing Alito's draft in those terms - as an unprecedented retreat in the arc of ever-expanding rights - have recently been denounced as either inexcusably ignorant or deliberately duplicitous by distinguished scholars like Yale's Akhil Amar, whosaysthat every first-year law student learns that the very same thing happened during FDR's second term as president, when the supreme court in 1937 inWest Coast Hotel v Parrishoverturned a long line of decisions that had blocked minimum wage and maximum hours and other worker-protection laws in the name of employers' rights of \"private property\" and the\"liberty of contract\".  To be sure, Amar's argument echoes that of the Alito draft, which cites Parrish and says, in effect, \"nothing to see here, we did the same thing before\" when we rolled back the liberty of contract line of decisions in 1937.Justice Alito and Professor Amar are simply wrong: profoundly so. That so-called (and quite misleadingly labeled)\"switch in time that saved the nine\"was nothing like the switch that Dobbs would represent. The 1937 \"switch\" was no sudden politically driven turnabout but was in fact the culmination oflong-simmering movements in legal and economic thought- movements that were reflected both in scholarship and in judicial opinions from the earliest days of the 20th century in places like Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' dissent inLochner v New Yorkinsisting that \"the 14th amendment does not enact Mr Herbert Spencer's social statics,\" movements that represented the growing conviction that the \"freedom\" to work at low wages and in miserable conditions was an illusion lacking both moral and legal foundations and one that simply helped perpetuate economic inequality and the exploitation of relatively powerless, not-yet-unionized workers by wealthy and powerfulcorporations.Indeed, it is noteworthy that West Coast Hotel v Parrish  -  the  29  March 1937 decision that is usually marked as the pivot point in the great constitutional upheaval - was handed down by precisely the same set of ninejustices as the nine who had rendered a decision pointing in the opposite direction less than a year earlier, on 1 June 1936, inMorehead v New York ex rel Tipaldo.   One justice of the nine, a moderate Republican named Owen J Roberts, who had been rethinking his position on the underlying legal theories, had foreshadowed his shifting views by writing a landmark opinion upholding milk price regulation,Nebbia v New York, by a 5-4 vote in 1934 - less than two months after the court had upheld a state mortgage moratorium law by a 5-4 vote inHome Building & Loan Ass'n v Blaisdell, a decision clearly foreshadowing the 1937 repudiation of Lochner's legacy by reconceiving the meaning of the constitution's clause forbidding all state impairments of the obligation of contracts.Dobbs would represent the crude payoff to a partisan political program to take over the federal judiciaryThat history is important to keep in mind if one is to understand the depth of the error made by those who seek to compare the 2022 tsunami that Dobbs would represent with the gradual shift in current represented by the 1937 movement away from liberty of contract to protection of workers and consumers. The head-spinning and altogether untimely switch in the supreme court's abortion jurisprudence that Dobbs would represent - if the decision the court announces late this June or early July is in substance what the leaked Alito draft indicated it would be - will reflect not the steady maturation of a long-developing jurisprudential movement but the crude payoff toa partisan political program to take over the federal judiciary, one beginning with Ronald Reagan's presidency and the rise of the Federalist Society, and advancing with supreme court appointments made by Republican presidents all of whom lost the popular vote (George W Bush, appointingJustice AlitoandChief Justice John Roberts; Donald J Trump, appointingNeil Gorsuch,Brett Kavanaugh, andAmy Coney Barrett), and made incircumstances of dubious legitimacy.Professor Amartreats as laughably naïvetheobservationby ACLU national legal director and Georgetown law professor David Cole that, although \"Parrish took away some rights of business owners ... its real effect was to expand rights protections for millions of Americans subject to exploitation by powerful corporations.\" Amar's rebuttal?He says, and I'm serious here, that it'd be equally legitimate to say that \"Dobbs' real effect would be to expand rights protection for millions of innocent, unborn Americans ... unborn humans, subject to extermination by society.\"It's hard to know where to begin in unraveling that alleged parallel. Suffice it to note that the status as rights-bearing persons of embryos and fetusesremains a matter of profound sectarian controversyin America and throughout the world while no such controversy attends the status as rights-bearing persons of the array of workers whose rights, at least under laws designed to limit economic exploitation if not directly under the constitution itself, were indisputably expanded by virtue of the Parrish decision and the overturning of the Lochner line of cases.The radical change in law and society that Dobbs would represent has no parallel in the history of the supreme courtPerhaps no less important is the indisputable fact that, although there remaina few commentatorswho continue to think that Lochner  was rightly decided and Parrish was wrong, there is a nearly universal consensus, certainly covering the ideological spectrum on the current supreme court, that the \"rights\" protected by Lochner and the other decisions that Parrish  tossed into the dustbin of history were not constitutionally sacrosanct, and that inequalities of bargaining power prevented the common-law baseline that Lochner  treated as immune to legislative modification from having any special constitutional status. At the same time, the notions of personal autonomy and bodily integrity that provide the constitutional foundation for the substantive \"liberty\" at stake in cases like Roe and Casey are almost universally accepted as real, although deep disagreements remain about whether, to what degree, and from what point in fetal development the protection of the unborn fetus can properly trump thatliberty.The upshot is that theradical change in law and societythat Dobbs would represent truly has no parallel in the history of the supreme court or in the history of the United States. As David Colewrites, the \"proper analogy is not Brown overruling Plessy, but a decision reviving Plessy, reversing Brown, and relegating Black people to enforced segregation after nearly 70 years of equal protection.\" For, as Jamelle Bouierightly observed, \"equal standing is undermined and eroded when the state can effectively seize your person for its own ends - that is, when it can force you to give birth.\" Whether or not one compares that compulsion and forced labor to literal enslavement, as I did in my1973 articleon Roe v Wade, attempts to minimize the huge retrogression this would represent must be dismissed as little more than shameful efforts to camouflage the carnage the supreme court of the United States is about to unleash both on its own legitimacy and, even more important, on the people in whose name it wields the power of judicial review.Laurence H Tribe is the Carl M Loeb University Professor of Constitutional Law Emeritus at Harvard University, the author of numerous books and articles, a distinguished supreme court advocate, and holder of 11 honorary degrees"
