Baseball-style final offer arbitration ensures that parties put their best offer forward and the arbitrator picks one or the other. The hammer of arbitration incentivizes both sides to reach a fair settlement on their own.Third, similar legislation in Australia is working. According to Rod Sims(https://jninstitute.org/news/rod-sims-explaining-the-news-media-bargaining-code/), the former chair of the Australian Competition &; Consumer Commission, the amounts paid to news organizations were over $200 million. More important than how much is who reached content licensing agreements. Country Press Australia, an affiliation of 160 smaller regional newspapers, was able to reach settlements with Google and Meta. More recently, a group of 24 small Australian publishers reached a deal with Google. We believe that Google, to their credit, has signed a content licensing agreement with every eligible Australian publisher.Bill Grueskin, professor of professional practice at Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism wrote in a paper(https://jninstitute.org/news/millions-of-dollars-for-news-shrouded-in-mysterious-deals/) for the Judith Neilson Institute, \"Monica Attard, a journalism professor in Sydney, says she can't persuade most students to take internships these days because it's so easy for them to land full-time jobs - and she assumes the code deserves much of the credit: 'I swear to God, I have not seen it like this in 20 years'.\"While there are clear benefits to publishers from collective negotiation, the question is: How should members of each collective organize themselves it in a way that is inclusive, fair, and transparent to all its members?As a matter of principle, News Media Canada and the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada believe that publishers large and small should benefit equally from any settlement - based on their proportionate investment in newsroom employees. Simply put, any settlements from collective negotiation would be shared among publishers on a pro rata basis - based on their total salaries and wages paid to eligible newsroom employees - less the expenses associated with this collective negotiation.C-18 builds on the success of Australia's News Media Bargaining Code. While not a silver bullet, it brings the value of trustworthy, high quality Canadian journalistic content to readers through more licensing deals, which will allow more publishers to reinvest in their newsroom and in their digital business transformation.Paul Deegan is president and CEO of News Media Canada.
