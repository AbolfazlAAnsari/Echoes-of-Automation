Russia is a very powerful nation, most of whose citizens seem to be thoroughly brainwashed, and with a long history of suppression and acceptance of dictatorship.China, too, keeps the lid on its population's opinions. Both these nations are bubbles waiting to burst. Elsewhere in the world, conflicts show no signs of resolution, right-wing ideologies are gaining footholds everywhere and the chaos of climate change is starting to make itself felt.At this point in the evolution of planet earth, humanity needs tolerance, understanding and cooperation from all quarters if it is to survive. This appears to be the opposite of what is happening at present.Steve EdmondsonCambridgeTo keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter byclicking hereLord of the RingsThe news from Ukraine shows Russian armed forces behaving like the orcs in Lord of the Rings, with their indiscriminate bombardment of cities and lawless killing and maiming of civilians. Yet Russians, unlike Tolkien's orcs are not a brutish, aggressive and malevolent race - far from it.This is what happens when evil takes root at the top. It spreads downwards - a common occurrence in autocratic regimes.Roger HindsSurreyProtecting the publicOn Thursday's Any Questions? on Radio 4, Robert Jennick attempted to justify the Home Office's ponderous approach to accepting Ukrainian refugees, by citing national security concerns.He argued that the primary function of any government is to protect its citizens. Unfettered access could unwittingly allow the ingress of terrorists. Unfortunately, he did not explain how a cohort of mothers with young children and senior citizens fleeing a war zone posed a realistic threat.However, the line about the government's responsibility to protect its people might have been news to those who lost loved ones prematurely to Covid.There was a dalliance with the philosophy of herd immunity at the beginning of the outbreak that contributed to seeding a nationwide infection prior to the first lockdown, and an ideological reluctance to enlist the assistance of local authorities, preferring to invest in expensive and less effective systems of tracking and tracing. We should also remember the failure to respond promptly to new variants and the hasty relaxation of restrictions.So, in all, a significant percentage of the UK's 165,000 coronavirus deaths were avoidable. But then again, sound bites may distract in the short term but real, effective governance actually requires equal measures of compassion, effectiveness and, perhaps most importantly, accountability.Nigel PlevinSomerset"
