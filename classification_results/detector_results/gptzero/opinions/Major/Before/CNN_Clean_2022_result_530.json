Either would have super-charged the imminent hyper-partisan House investigations of the Justice Department and the FBI. Not-guilty verdicts or a hung jury would have energized the presidential candidacy of former President Donald Trump. (He hasreportedly said that, if elected, he will \"very, very seriously\" consider full pardons for those who breached the Capitol that day.)Any other trial outcome would also have bolstered January 6 insurrectionists' belief that theends justified the meansof using bear spray, baseball bats, flag poles and fire extinguishers toinjure 140 Capitol police officers.The guilty verdicts also give the DOJ aperfect recordof convicting all 13 Capitol rioters who have gone to trial.More than 450 other participantshave pleaded guilty.This trial, however, was a first. No jury had ever considered conspiracy charges against January 6 defendants, though one for the militantProud Boys is set for December. Conspiracies are important to prosecute because concerted criminal action poses greater danger to society than similar crimes committed by single individuals. Convictions, particularly in marquee cases, may deter future conspirators.The jury proceeded with care. It deliberated for three days. It distinguished defendants against whom the prosecution proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on seditious conspiracy from those against whom the evidence fell short.Lead prosecutor Kathryn Rakoczy, her team and the FBI had diligently assembled their case, procuring cooperation from multiple Oath Keepers to provide investigatory leads and take the stand. Terry Cummings, a one-time Oath Keeper,testifiedfor prosecutors about the arsenal that his former co-conspirators had secretly assembled at a Virginia hotel across the Potomac, ready for transport to the Capitol. \"I have not seen that many weapons in one location since I was in the military,\" Cummings told the jury.Graydon Young, another former Oath Keeper cooperating with prosecutors, testified that the co-conspirators had animplicit agreement with the shared purpose of stopping Congress' certification of President Joe Biden's election. That testimony gave prosecutors' a direct answer to the defense's primaryline of attack -- that there was no \"meeting of the minds\" among the defendants. The less direct answer was that the conspirators' agreement can be inferred, as here, from evidence of coordinated operations.Rhodes was convicted even though he never entered the Capitol. The evidence prosecutors marshaled against him was meticulous. It included anencrypted messageto his fellow Oath Keepers before January 6 that encouraged  them to \"rise up in insurrection.\" Another message said, \"We aren't getting through this without a civil war.\"And he told another witness days after January 6 that the only thing he regretted was \"not bringing rifles,\" saying that if he had a do-over, he'd \"hang (expletive) Pelosi from a lamppost.\" Little wonder that thejury rejecteda defense lawyer's closing argument that this was a \"good Samaritan\" group, only in Washington to protect Roger Stone and other friends of Trump.Elections have winners and losers, and when losers resort to violence, a stable democracy requires that they be held to account. By their verdict Tuesday, 12 citizens on a jury reaffirmed for all of us that our constitutional republic will not abide attempts to overthrow it.Opinion by Dennis AftergutTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
