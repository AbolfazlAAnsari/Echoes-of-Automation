Baumol noted that productivity, measured as the amount of \"stuff\" that could be produced per worker in a given time, varies across sectors. In those that produce physical output - whether cars, wheat, toilet seats or whatever - productivity has risen consistently, driven by technical innovations and the increasing use of machines in production. In contrast, in services such as producing educated students, staging arts performances and designing government policies, productivity growth has been much less - or even non-existent: \"A half hour horn quintet,\" as Baumol wrote, \"calls for the expenditure of 2 ½ man-hours in its performance, and any attempt to increase productivity here is likely to be viewed with concern by critics and audience alike.\"The problem is that while wages across the economy tend to be driven by the big productivity increases in things-production the labour requirement for many services does not fall, which means, with higher wages being paid to that labour, the cost of these services rises.Two vignettes from the academic environment I work in illustrate a new wrinkle on Baumol's insight, which is that in some services we seem to be requiring, not just more-expensive labour, but more labour, period, to accomplish the same task.On a recent Zoom webinar, a recently appointed senior manager complained about not having any \"offices\" reporting to them, and an urgent task was to create new directors lower down on the org chart. Aggrandizement is not the only reason administrative positions in my and other universities seem to have proliferated in recent years. But whatever its cause this expansion of managers, seemingly at will, does not produce more knowledge or educate more citizens though it does drive up costs.A second example illustrates the sclerotic effects of this administrative overburden. Cases of academic dishonesty, primarily cheating on tests, plagiarizing, and using contract essay writers, have exploded at all universities, especially during the pandemic. I dread dealing with this issue, especially plagiarism and contract essay-writing as the paperwork needed to build a case takes several hours. In a particularly egregious case this spring, I reported the infraction in mid-April. The hearing occurred in late July and in addition to me involved a department head, associate dean, an assistant within the Dean's office, the student, and the student's advocate (who did not show). The formal notice of decision arrived in early September some 20 weeks after I reported the issue.William Watson: Canada's economic plate-glass ceiling(https://financialpost.com/opinion/william-watson-canadas-economic-plate-glass-ceiling)Opinion: Free up the cannabis market(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-free-up-the-cannabis-market)Nota Bene: 'Mr. Speaker, we come to tax - central to solving the riddle of growth'(https://financialpost.com/opinion/nota-bene-mr-speaker-we-come-to-tax-central-to-solving-the-riddle-of-growth)The delay reflects the need to allow the student to consult with a student advocate and the scheduling hassles in finding a time where all could meet. A decision on the veracity of the allegation and a recommended consequence likely occurred shortly after the meeting. The remaining time taken reflects the need for a series of \"sign-offs\" and butt-covering reviews by a range of overseers. Neither deciding nor communicating the decision can be left to a lower part of the administrative food chain since due process must be both followed and seen to be followed.We see similar bureaucratic bloat throughout the public sector. The permitting process in cities exerts increasing delays and cost, further compromising productivity. A local shop in Winnipeg, where I live, wished to erect a non-load-bearing display wall containing no plumbing or electrical work. The permit required seven weeks of deliberation.The rural municipalities just outside Winnipeg that expedite building and other regulations are siphoning off commercial and residential development from the big city because, in the words of a prominent independent food retailer, \"Winnipeg is so hard to do business with.\"In the May 2022 federal budget, funds were allocated to many committees, some new, some old, to address economic growth and productivity. How endless jawboning on Zoom will boost Canada's economy was not explained, however. As the Fraser Institute recently noted(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/comparing-government-and-private-sector-job-growth-in-the-covid-19-era), since the start of the pandemic government job growth has far outstripped private-sector job growth. Baumol's \"cost disease\" occurs at all levels of government and the result of expanding government is that a sector where productivity is either growing slowly or even declining accounts for an ever-increasing share of the economy. To add to the problem, public sector wages and benefits are doing Baumol one better and racing ahead of compensation in the private sector.In the university examples I used, every one of the individuals involved is committed and competent and performing \"essential functions.\" But the sum of the bureaucratic parts results in a whole that will not create more stuff. Our instinct to widen the scope of regulation creates long-term secular cost pressures. Inflation bred so deeply in the bone will not be tamed by raising interest rates.Gregory Mason is associate professor of economics at the University of Manitoba. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
