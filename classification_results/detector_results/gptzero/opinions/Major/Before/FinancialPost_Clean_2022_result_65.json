The results indicated widespread support for national daycare (69 per cent), pharmacare (79 per cent) and dental care (72 per cent). However, the poll also asked respondents if they support the new programs (and spending) if they were linked with GST hikes to pay for them. Support plummetted(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/file/polling-canadians-support-for-new-fed-govt-programs-infographicjpg) from 69 per cent to 36 per cent for national daycare, 79 per cent to 40 per cent for pharmacare, and 72 per cent to 42 per cent for dental care.Canada's experience(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/learning-from-the-past.pdf) with wanting more government spending without higher taxes, which lasted roughly from the mid-1960s to the early-1990s, resulted in a near currency and debt crisis until governments across the country and of all political stripes adopted a different consensus, which lasted more than two decades and coincided with general prosperity. Canadians should seriously rethink the emerging consensus of wanting more spending but not paying for it. It won't end well as there's no such thing as a free lunch.Jason Clemens and Jake Fuss are economists with the Fraser Institute. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved."
