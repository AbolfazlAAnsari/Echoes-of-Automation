Calm has been a product of having not just a prime minister who spent more than 20 years in parliament before taking the top job, but a seasoned opposition leader as well.Both Anthony Albanese, elected in 1996, and Peter Dutton (2001) have experienced the giddy heights of government and the dark depths of opposition. Neither is obsessed with trying to win each day, but focused on the longer term - not an easy task in the 24-hour news cycle.Dutton is operating on a three-year plan to at least render the Coalition competitive. Albanese has a strategy to win two to three terms, a tenure he believes is required to entrench reforms and safeguard them from a change of government.On Wednesday, he recommitted to exploring universal free childcare, \"which would be the logical next step of what's an important reform for this country\".Whereas the past decade and half has been punctuated by too many inexperienced leaders on both sides, some of whom actually hated each other, Dutton and Albanese get on pretty well. They've known each other for a long time and, while political foes, have a personal relationship based on a mutual respect.It is not dissimilar to the vibe that permeated politics when John Howard was prime minister and Kim Beazley led Labor.Dutton summed up the tone of the relationship at the end of budget week. \"I have a great deal of respect for him,\" he said. \"He occupies a very important high office in our country, and I've had the great honour of working under four Liberal leaders.\"I've learnt a lot over my 20 years in parliament. I think we mature naturally in these jobs. I intend it to be a very tight race with the prime minister ... He might write me off and believe that he's got the next election in the bag, but I'm going to fight every day between now and then.\"A more significant contributor to the government's successful first six months has been the return of process, most notably the embrace of parliament.The Morrison government deserves some slack. Most of its last term was consumed by a round-the clock response to an unprecedented global disaster, compounded by having to wrangle premiers running parochial agendas.Still, at both the start and end of the term, and during the lulls in between, the former government displayed an aversion to utilising parliament, one of the most powerful tools available to any government.At the start of each sitting period, the vibe was always one of: \"Parliament's sitting, we're keeping our heads down.\" It felt hearts and minds were won on the hustings, not inside the building Morrison ruthlessly disparaged as the \"Canberra bubble\".There were periods during which neither house had any legislation of consequence to debate. On some days, agendas were empty.Sitting weeks were something to be endured, and the best way to do that was to follow the path of least resistance while muddling through question time.The strategy rendered the government a slow-moving target. Labor and others were more than happy to fill the vacuum. So the Coalition became renowned for faring poorly when parliament sat - which, in turn, fuelled its paranoia about sitting weeks.In stark contrast, the Albanese government has jam-packed each sitting session with an agenda of bills. When parliament first sat after the election, its priority was climate change legislation, including the 2030 target of a 43 per cent reduction in emissions over 2005 levels.This fortnight, the last before Christmas, it's all about industrial relations, the National Anti-Corruption Commission, cheaper childcare, electric vehicles, free trade, and more. At the time of writing, in 2&#xBD; sitting blocs since the election, the government has secured the passage of 29 bills, and delivered a budget.Its task has been made easier by having the most government-friendly Senate since Julia Gillard's Labor and the Greens ruled the roost in both houses between 2010 and 2013.This Senate is a touch trickier, given the government needs the Greens plus one. David Pocock has made an early start in emulating the indecisive Nick Xenophon, but Pocock is not in it for the optics, and his sympathies lie firmly with Labor's agenda.For the government, stacking parliament with legislation guarantees the conversation is almost always about it and its agenda.Even when that agenda is controversial, as in the case of the IR legislation, it enables the incumbent to argue for what it believes is important - in this case higher wages - be that by defending itself in the public domain or asking Dorothy Dixers in parliament.Howard used to do it. Even the hapless Gillard/Rudd government, which disgraced itself with years of internecine warfare, was simultaneously pushing a legislative agenda, which gives it a legacy more favourable that it otherwise should be.Question time was so benign this week that Albanese told a staffer to order someone to do something stupid, just to liven things up. It was a joke, of course.By the end of next week, the government will have pretty much implemented its pre-election agenda, as well as things it didn't tell us about, like the IR rules.It says with a nod and a wink there's more to come. \"This is just in our first six months. I look forward to the next six months and well beyond,\" Albanese said yesterday.Phillip Coorey is The Australian Financial Review's political editor."
