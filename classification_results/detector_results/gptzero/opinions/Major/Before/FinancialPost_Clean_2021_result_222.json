            "inputText": "It was another tough year for Canadians. From soaring prices to COVID restrictions, we've had to put up with a lot. Though the pandemic has obviously been a factor, many of our long-standing challenges, dating from since well before COVID, are largely due to bad government policy. That may seem pessimistic, but it should actually give Canadians hope for 2022: if governments created these problems, they can fix them, too.Consider government finances. In the years before COVID, Canada's governments were already operating well in the red. Between 2007/08 and 2019/20 (pre-COVID), government debt levels rose(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/growing-debt-burden-for-canadians.pdf) in Ottawa and every province - in large part due to spending increases. Growth in program spending outpaced(http://www.rbc.com/economics/economic-reports/pdf/canadian-fiscal/prov_fiscal.pdf) economic growth in every province and federally over that period. Federal spending (excluding debt interest charges) reached $9,671 per Canadian(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/prime-ministers-and-government-spending-updated-2021-edition.pdf) (inflation-adjusted) in 2019/20 - the highest level in Canadian history.Then the pandemic hit, opening the flood gates for even higher spending. Federally, program spending jumped to a projected $12,825 per person in 2021/22. And all this new spending was financed by new debt. Among 29 advanced countries, Canada had the fifth highest(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/caution-required-when-comparing-canadas-debt-to-other-countries.pdf) level of total government debt (federal, provincial and local) as a share of the economy for 2020. According to the Trudeau government, total federal debt alone will exceed(https://www.budget.gc.ca/efu-meb/2021/home-accueil-en.html) $2.0 trillion by 2025/26, and that's before the spending spree anticipated in the upcoming spring budget. A lack of spending restraint, combined with Canada's aging population, will further strain Ottawa's finances.Our governments sometimes seem to forget that Canadians have to pay interest on all this debt. Federal debt interest will cost a projected $24.5 billion in 2021/22, rising to $40.9 billion by 2026/27. A mere one percentage point increase in the effective interest rate would cause annual interest costs to jump to $50.9 billion(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/blogs/federal-finances-marginally-improve-but-trudeau-government-ignores-risks) in 2026/27. Higher debt interest costs could prompt further downgrades in Canada's debt rating, which could spur a cycle of larger budget deficits and more debt accumulation.On the tax front, Canadians continue to endure bad government policy. In 2015, the Trudeau government raised the top rate of personal income tax from 29 to 33 per cent. Since 2010, seven out of 10 provincial governments have also increased their top personal income tax rates. Canada now has some of the highest(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/canadas-rising-personal-tax-rates-and-failing-tax-competitiveness-2020.pdf) such rates in the developed world. And tax hikes may not be over. The minority Liberals need another party to support any legislation. In concert with the NDP, they may well raise capital gains taxes, introduce a new wealth tax and/or increase taxes on entrepreneurs. Higher taxes make Canada less attractive to the entrepreneurs, professionals and business-owners who drive innovation, investment and job creation - things we need more of, not less.Unfortunately, higher taxes and increased spending have not led to improvements in key policy areas such as health care. Canada was the second-highest spender(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/comparing-performance-universal-health-care-countries-2021.pdf) (at 11.3 per cent of GDP) among 28 comparator countries with universal health care in 2019 yet our performance on key indicators was generally mediocre to poor. The pandemic exacerbated these systemic problems. For instance, in 2021 Canadians faced the longest(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/waiting-your-turn-2021.pdf) health-care wait times since 1993, when the Fraser Institute began publishing wait times data.Investment, or lack of it, is another big problem. A recent study(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/international-comparison-of-capital-expenditures.pdf) found that from 2010 to 2019, the growth rate of capital investment in Canada was substantially below that in the United States and other developed countries. This is in sharp contrast to the previous decade, when Canada generally enjoyed higher rates of investment growth than other developed countries. And this isn't just a problem in the oil and gas industry. From 2014 to 2019, a majority(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/industry-level-private-sector-capital-expenditures-in-canada-1990-2019.pdf) of industries experienced reduced investment in intellectual property and machinery &; equipment - areas critical to productivity growth, which is the foundation of economic growth and recovery.Joe Oliver: The fiscal update - you reap what you sow(https://financialpost.com/opinion/joe-oliver-the-fiscal-update-you-reap-what-you-sow)Opinion: Health-care waits are now the longest ever(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-health-care-waits-are-now-the-longest-ever)Gwyn Morgan: We're still a long way from normal(https://financialpost.com/opinion/gwyn-morgan-were-still-a-long-way-from-normal)Franco Terrazzano: Governments have created the perfect inflation storm(https://financialpost.com/opinion/franco-terrazzano-governments-have-created-the-perfect-inflation-storm)Finally, let's look at the energy sector, which represents more than 10 per cent of our economy. Spending in Canada's oil and gas sector plummeted(https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2510006401&;cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2015&;cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2020&;referencePeriods=20150101%2C20200101) from $54.5 billion in 2015 to $21.4 billion in 2020 -a 60 per cent drop. According to a 2021 survey(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/canada-us-energy-sector-competitiveness-survey-2021.pdf) of oil and gas investors, among 22 energy-producing Canadian and U.S. jurisdictions, no Canadian province, not even Alberta, ranked in the top 10 most attractive places to invest. Investors cited uncertainty about regulations, among other concerns. Recent announcements by the Trudeau government, including a hard cap on greenhouse gas emissions(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/trudeaus-emissions-cap-reminds-westerns-of-his-fathers-national-energy-program) in the oil and gas sector, only make this worse.In 2021, as in 2020, Canada faced a unique set of challenges. But the fundamental problems in government policy existed before the pandemic. Here's the good news; as a new year dawns, policymakers across the country, including in Ottawa, can change the outlook for 2022 by acknowledging the root causes of these problems and pursuing solutions for them.Tegan Hill is an economist at the Fraser Institute. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
