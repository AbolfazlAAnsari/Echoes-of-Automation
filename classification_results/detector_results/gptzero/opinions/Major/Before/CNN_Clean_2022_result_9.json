It is unclear who made thedeepfake, but theUkrainian governmenthad been warning for weeks that Russia may push manipulated media.The video quickly spread on social media.Zelensky promptly respondedwith a video of his own from the streets of Kyiv, proclaiming that he will continue to defend Ukraine, and that the country's citizens will only lay down their arms when they are victorious against Russia. And, the same day, majorsocial media companiesremoved the deepfake for violating their policies on misinformation and manipulated media.The Zelensky deepfake failed to unleash confusion and mayhem, as seems to have been the intention. As Sam Gregory, the program director for the human rights groupWITNESS, observed, it was a \"best-case scenario\" for a situation like this. The Ukrainian government had engaged in extensive \"prebunking\" - warning of possible manipulated videos before they emerged. The deepfake itself was of poor quality. A credible person (Zelensky) quickly rebutted the deepfake's message to his millions ofsocial media followers. And the deepfake clearly violated social media platform policies against manipulated content, allowing the deepfake to be removed, Gregory said.The ease with which deepfakes are made and distributed illuminates a growing risk not only to governments, but also to the private sector - where the use of believable manipulated media could be used to confuse customers, partners and employees and damage corporate brands and valuations. But the experience of the Zelensky deepfake provides some clues for what businesses can do to meet the threat.Consider how falsified media could harm businesses. For example, an \"undercover\" video of a CEO seeming to use a racial epithet could circulate on the eve of a major product launch, torching the leader's reputation and throwing the launch into doubt. Or the leaders of two competitors could appear in a video shaking hands to announce a (nonexistent) merger, goosing stocks to the benefit of anyone prepared for the jump. And, with many employees continuing to work remotely, a falsified video of a chief information security officer or chief financial officer could trick unsuspecting employees into providing IT credentials to an outsider or wiring funds to a thief, in a kind of cyber-impersonation campaign that the FBI calls \"business identity compromise.\"The deepfakes could be spread by any number of bad actors, from industry competitors to disgruntled former employees, from trolls motivated by spite to profiteers seeking a payday through fraud, to foreign states that see strategic advantage in damaging the business community.What can Corporate America do in response?First, much as President Zelensky and his government removed the deepfake's sting by warning ahead of time about the prospect of manipulated media, the C-suite should prepare employees for growing cyber threats, and deepfakes, in particular.
