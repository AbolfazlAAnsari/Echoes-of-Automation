With the COVID-19 pandemic, medical practitioners across the country are now seeing significant declines(https://nationalpost.com/news/eerily-quiet-ers-before-covid-19-surge-could-mean-problems-down-the-road-doctors-say) in rates of emergency room visits and hospital admissions for serious illnesses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that this phenomenon is a result of people's fear of leaving home and that their unwillingness to seek medical attention will likely be deleterious in the short- and long-term.Yet the truth is that the reasons underlying this trend are not entirely understood at this point in time. Sure, patients may have an increased threshold to seeking medical care in times such as these and may be less likely to access the health-care system unless it's absolutely vital to their survival. But they may also, as a result of self-isolation and social distancing, have limited their schedules and reduced their levels of activity to the point where stress-related medical ailments such as myocardial infarctions are less likely to occur. Alternatively, physicians and nurse practitioners may be providing their patients with enough guidance, instruction and reassurance via teleconference or videoconference to allow patients to safely keep their distance from hospitals.\"Our volumes are way, way, way, way down,\" says one Ottawa ER doctor. But the story is the same across the country.Regardless of what the causes may be, the lower rates of health-care utilization should give the health-care community reason to pause and reflect. What will the health-care system look like once the COVID-19 pandemic has passed? Will patients who have chosen to stay at home re-emerge and once again access the health-care system at previous or higher rates? Will overall patient disease profiles and clinical outcomes worsen because people have delayed treatment for their medical conditions? Or will we see a change in how patients choose to access health care? Will we see a change in how providers choose to deliver health care? Might we even see an overall reduction in health-care utilization?The answer to these questions will ultimately be found in the data. The collection of high-quality, population-level data will be invaluable as we attempt to differentiate between adverse outcomes related directly to the COVID-19 pandemic and those that were an indirect consequence of the crisis. More specifically, determining which patients should have sought care but chose not to because of COVID-19 and how this approach may have affected their health will be of critical importance.In the meantime, we as health care professionals should take this opportunity to determine how we \"return to normal\" once the pandemic has eased and the public health restrictions have been relaxed. The simple answer is that we go back to doing exactly what we did prior to the dawn of COVID-19 and perhaps even more, in an effort to compensate for what was not done during the peak of the pandemic. The more complex answer would be to examine how it was that we were able to do so much less in the face of a crisis and to see whether or not such an approach could be sustained in moderation without compromising patient outcomes. Perhaps robust data from this pandemic could enlighten our ability to identify patients who might see the greatest advantage from intervention, while identifying those for whom medical optimization or careful watching is acceptable or maybe even favourable.A nurse uses a web camera to communicate with a patient in London, Ont.In managing individual patients and their concerns, we, as providers, often lose sight of the global health picture and the impact that our actions may have on the health-care system. Yes, we do our best to adhere to peer-reviewed guidelines and evidence-based medicine, but we have to ask ourselves whether we do a good enough job of debating the merits of each therapy or intervention within the context of our health-care system. We must learn from this period and begin to reassess what is necessary versus unnecessary, essential versus non-essential, appropriate versus inappropriate. At the same time, patients, and society in general, should reflect on their everyday lives and their lifestyles and determine how it is that they may be able to access the health-care system with less frequency.The COVID-19 pandemic will go down in history as one of the most profound medical tragedies in several generations. With tragedies, however, come opportunities for learning and adapting. With the ever-expanding costs associated with the Canadian health-care system, we may be due for a reset.National PostAnsar Hassan is a cardiac surgeon at the New Brunswick Heart Centre at Saint John Regional Hospital in Saint John, N.B.
