This law was intended to protect trafficking victims but has had the effect of encouraging the illicit movement of alien children. Compounding the problem is the government policy of quickly releasing UACs to a \"sponsor\", a fact well-known to the traffickers, smugglers, and parents already in the country. Vetting of sponsors is often incomplete, raising the prospect that UACs are handed over to an adult who will subject them to further trafficking, physical or sexual abuse, or other forms of neglect.The Trump administration handed the incoming Biden administration the most secure border ever. Part of that legacy included significantly interrupting this child exploitation network through several successful policies, including the use of the Title 42 emergency health authority to expel all aliens apprehended at the southern border as a tool to stop the spread of COVID-19.But, the relief for migrant children from the smuggling and trafficking networks was short-lived due to the Biden administration’s disdain for immigration enforcement. Specifically, in this context, the Biden administrationrefused to apply Title 42to UACs. This decision, which the Administration doubled-down on after courts initially tried to stop it, guaranteed that every UAC apprehended at the border would be allowed into the country.The tragic, yet predictable, consequence was that this policy reignited the pipeline to an unfathomable new level. In FY 2021, CBP apprehended 144,834 UACs at the southern border — nearly double the previous record set in FY 2019 of 76,020. As bad as those numbers are, FY 2022 will be worse by the time the calendar hits October 1 (the first day of FY 2023). Between October 2021 and May 2022, already 100,336 UACs have been apprehended. Under Biden’s watch, a total of 227,058 UACs have been apprehended at the southern border—a jaw dropping level of human suffering.These children did not make the journey north on their own accord. While many were smuggled, either willingly or by their parents, an untold number were trafficked. All were subjected to various kinds of physical and emotional abuse along the way. This inhumane policy demonstrates the human cost of open borders. There is nothing compassionate about policies that encourage the harm to children. A federal government committed to ‘America First’ principles would not function as the equivalent of a business partner of drug cartels and traffickers.Robert Law is the director of the Center for Homeland Security & Immigration at the America First Policy Institute and the former chief of the Office of Policy & Strategy at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Trump administration."
