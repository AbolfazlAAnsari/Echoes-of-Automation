Perhaps this movement now has the momentum to bring about the necessary actions and not simply more commissions.Robert Murray                                          NottinghamImmunity newsMedical scientists from Sweden's leading university, the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, have produced research indicating thatpublic immunity to Covid-19 is \"significantly higher\" than antibody tests have suggested. From a public health perspective this is very good news and comes at a time when the usual suspects look likely to kick-start a new wave of hysteria about a return of the coronavirus at the end of this year.It's even better news for the economy since we cannot afford a lockdown every time we are visited by a viral infection. The global death toll from Covid-19 looks as if it will be around that of the 1950s/1960s flu pandemics in spite of the world population having doubled. Future historians will struggle to see this outbreak's impact except for our disastrous response which wrecked our underskilled workforce's prospects.Dr John Cameron                                          St Andrews, ScotlandBelfast tunnel hopesThe concept of the rail tunnel link to Belfast should be high on the government's agenda. Such a project is crucial to post-coronavirus and post-Brexit competitiveness.Such a project will necessitate the reinstatement of the Port Road line in southwest Scotland and that will be an economic boon in itself - and popular.Freight will be able to board trains directly at Belfast and proceed direct to London - and continental Europe via the Channel Tunnel.All in all, the UK will be a more attractive place to invest in. However, to reap the economic rewards it is crucial that the UK takes a leaf out of China's book and completes the schemes in the space of a few years rather than decades.John Barstow                                          Pulborough,                     West SussexLeader without a clueJohn Rentoul stole,in his article, my thunder! I'm not unhappy, as I was going to write in much the same vein as him, so I guess I'll say well done John and I'll make just one point.One skill a leader needs is the ability to see a new way forward and lead people to that way. However, my personal experience of trying to be a good leader quickly taught me that unless concrete, recognisable steps quickly follow any leadership declaration, people very quickly think that the leader is full of good ideas but doesn't have a clue how to implement them.Regrettably, I think Boris Johnson is rapidly becoming this type of leader (if he wasn't already as mayor of London). This does not bode well for the rest of us, who I think are becoming sick of three-word promises and would much rather see concrete and less trumpeted steps to our future.Steve Mumby                                          London"
