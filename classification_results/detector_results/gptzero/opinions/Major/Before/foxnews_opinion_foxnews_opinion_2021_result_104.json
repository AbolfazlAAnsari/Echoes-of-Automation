Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they?\" Matthew 7:16Under Pope Francis’ pontificate,church attendancehas plummeted. So too havevocations to religious life.Confidence in the Church’s hierarchyis at an all-time low. During the pandemic, Francis capitulated to (or more accurately allied with) oligarchs and secular leaders in governments who demanded the closing of churches whileabortion clinicsand big corporations remained open.Church attendance has never recovered from the \"Great Reset.\" It turns out that a social justice pope can make you popular with the atheist Davos crowd, but it doesn’t have much evangelistic appeal with the world’s rank and file Catholics, many of whom feel their faith in the institution of the church is being taken for granted by an out of touch, callous, and decadent hierarchy.The sad truth is that Pope Francis’ neglect of his Cuban flock when they need him most and are closer than ever to tasting freedom, was predictable. During his 2015 papal visit to Latin America, Pope Francis happily accepted acontroversial giftfrom Bolivian President Evo Morales — a crucifix in the shape of a hammer and sickle, the universal symbol of communism.WASHINGTON DC REMOVES ‘CUBA LIBRE’ STREET PAINTING FROM IN FRONT OF CUBAN EMBASSYThis sacrilegious melding of the most sacred with an ideology that has murdered and persecuted so many Christians, was no less offensive because it was a replica of a crucifix designed by fellow Jesuit, Luis Espinal, a Marxist Spanish priest who was assassinated in Bolivia in 1980.No one was more offended than the Catholics who awaited his Holy Father on his next stop in Cuba, people who have been suffering for six decades under the cruelty of Castro’s communist dictatorship.In anticipation ofFrancis’ 2015 visitto Cuba, the government’s secret police rounded up dissidents who might disrupt the regime’s narrative, including members of \"Las Damas en Blanco\" (Ladies in White), a group of Catholic mothers and wives who gather weekly after mass to pray and peacefully protest against the communist government for arresting, imprisoning, and disappearing their loved ones who have challenged the communist regime. Their leader, Berta Soler, and others were detained by police, preventing them from attending the pope’s mass on the island.After the Mass Soler and the other Catholic mothers were barred from attending, Pope Francis met with Fidel Castro himself, reportedly discussing climate change, but not the abject poverty of the Cuban people or the prisons filled with those who dare complain about it.In the first year of his pontificate, Francis made a public display of washing the feet of prisoners during Holy Thursday Mass. In Cuba, he played along with the Communist Party narrative that political prisoners don’t exist, despite the sad reality that they are the most marginalized and persecuted of Cubans on the forsaken island.It’s hard to reconcile why a Catholic pontiff would carry water for a dictatorship thatsurveilsreligious leaders and cruelly punishes children who attendcatechismclasses by barring them from attending university in the future. There is only one painful explanation and that is that he sympathizes with their ideology and is a conscious or unconscious apologist for their crimes against humanity.In 1917, the Bolsheviks took control of Russia under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin. That same year,Our Lady of Fatimaappeared to three peasant children in the Portuguese countryside. During that apparition, which was officially recognized by the Catholic Church in 1930, the Virgin Mary implored the children to pray for Russia and her conversion. If not, she warned, Russia would \"spread her errors throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Church\".At the time, the children could not have known what any of this meant, but today, and especially in Cuba, millions know exactly what the horrors of communism have wrought. So should Pope Francis, if only he would listen to his impoverished, persecuted and abandoned flock in Cuba.
