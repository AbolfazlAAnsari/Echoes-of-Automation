Though lengthened by COVID, these waits have far more to do with long-standing failures of domestic policy than with the global pandemic.This year marks the 30th edition of the Fraser Institute's annual survey(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/waiting-your-turn-wait-times-for-health-care-in-canada-2021) of physicians.
