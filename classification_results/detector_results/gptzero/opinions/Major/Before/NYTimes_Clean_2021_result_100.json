I have no way to protect my children at school, and there is no virtual option. What type of society do we live in where our children don’t deserve to be cherished and kept safe? Thank you, Ms. Valenti, for giving us all a voice.Anais SonderPhoenixToo Late, Alex AzarTo the Editor:Re“More Americans Need to Get a Covid Vaccine,” by Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services under President Donald Trump (Opinion guest essay, Aug. 5):It was with a combination of amusement and outrage that I read Alex Azar’s belated explanation of the prior administration’s efforts in the development of our Covid-19 vaccines. Where was his voice when our now disgraced former president was downplaying the seriousness of the pandemic and undermining the efforts of the C.D.C. at controlling it through social distancing and masks?His failure to speak out helped transform what should have been readily accepted measures into a political wedge issue that has resulted in tragic and avoidable morbidity and mortality.While he is to be commended for finally stepping forward, his essay should be recognized for what it is — a desperate effort to rehabilitate his image. The only reason we are reading it now is that he no longer has a job to lose by having it published.Jeff MoormanFairfield, Conn.The writer is a retired emergency physician.What Can We Do in Afghanistan?To the Editor:Re “We Cannot Stand By and Watch Afghanistan Collapse,” by Kai Eide and Tadamichi Yamamoto (Opinion guest essay, Aug. 3):Whenever I read about diplomacy in Afghanistan, my first question is not what should we do, but what can we do? What leverage do we have to influence the Taliban? What can we offer them that they do not believe they can take for themselves, and are we willing to offer that? Or with what can we credibly threaten them?Without answers, I worry that any concern for the people of Afghanistan, no matter how heartfelt or how insightful, will come to nothing.David FoxNeedham, Mass.Don’t Invest in ChinaTo the Editor:Re “Invest in China, but Without Any Illusions” (Strategies column, Sunday Business, July 25):Is Jeff Sommer serious?Your editorial page has condemned repression in Xinjiang and Tibet and the crushing of freedom in Hong Kong. Yet Mr. Sommer says it’s OK to invest in China, although “with certain reservations.”Does no one understand that investment in China helps strengthen China and enables it to go ahead with genocide and freedom-crushing while ignoring complaints from the free world?Clyde PrestowitzPotomac, Md.The writer, a former official in the Reagan and Clinton administrations, is the author of “The World Turned Upside Down: America, China and the Struggle for Global Leadership.”PHOTO:    (PHOTOGRAPH BY Lu Zhang FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
