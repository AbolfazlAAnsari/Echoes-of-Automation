It's being asked all over the United States by Black Americans being left to the predations of criminals, in large part thanks to the woke virtue signaling of many Black Lives Matter leaders and media allies. In Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser emblazoned the enormous yellow words \"BLACK LIVES MATTER\" on 16th Street. Protesters quickly added \"DEFUND THE POLICE.\" One month later, 11-year-old Davon McNeal was shot in the head while heading to a family cookout on July 4. His grandfather, John Ayala, lamented: \"We're protesting for months, for weeks, saying, 'Black Lives Matter. Black Lives Matter.' Black lives matter it seems like, only when a police officer shoots a Black person. What about all the Black-on-Black crime that's happening in the community?\"McNeal was just one of the latest victims of a wave of violence gripping America's major cities. Last weekend, at least 89 people were shot in Chicago, leaving at least 17 dead. Shootings in Philadelphia have spiked 67 percent. In the first week of June, Los Angeles saw a shocking 250 percent increase in murders from the prior week. New York City's shootings have skyrocketed 44 percent over last year's numbers; every person shot there the week of June 29 -- 101 -- was from a minority community. It turns out that the agenda of Black Lives Matter, which includes fighting against the prevalence of police -- a call taken up by Democratic mayors and city councils around the United States -- endangers Black lives far more than the presence of police.Yet these lives don't particularly matter for Black Lives Matter advocates, apparently. Black lives matter when we're talking about police brutality. But Don Lemon has no airtime each night for those who seek to talk about threats to Black lives that dwarf in severity problems related to policing -- and that are just as newsworthy. Indeed, the statistical case is unassailable that the daily murder of minority youths in America's major cities is farmorenewsworthy than the latest cable panel discussion of \"white fragility\" or the \"power of whiteness.\"But our current Black Lives Matter moment isn't about Davon McNeal, even if the wages of Black Lives Matter's recommended policies are death for those left unprotected by law enforcement. All that matters for too many in our elite institutions is the narrative that America's systems are the greatest obstacle to Black Americans. And not all lives lost are equally valuable in promoting that perverse narrative.FROM BEN SHAPIRO   "
