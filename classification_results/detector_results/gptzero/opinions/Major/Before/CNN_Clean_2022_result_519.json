Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., at a dinner with Alito and his wife.The Hobby Lobby case involved a challenge to the so-called contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act, which required employers to cover all female contraceptives approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The owners of some for-profit businesses argued that these forms of birth control were actually abortion-inducing drugs - and that forcing employers to cover them violated employers' rights.According to the Times, Schenck said he was told that the employers would win the case from a conservative donor who had close social ties to Alito and his wife - and that Alito had written the majority opinion.Schenck wasn't present when his sources allegedly received news about the ruling, but several acquaintances report his telling the same story about the2014 Hobby Lobby decision, the Times reported. Schenck's emails from 2014 and beyond also reinforce that he had some kind of inside information about the case and expected his side to win it, according to the Times.In a statement the Supreme Court provided to CNN on Saturday, Alitocalled the tipoff allegationsconcerning the dinner conversation \"completely false.\"In an interview with CNN, the donor cited by Schenck also denied allegations of receiving information about the Hobby Lobby ruling, though she admitted that she and her husband dined at Alito's home.But this report is the last thing the court needed with its approval ratings already at an all-time low.It hasn't always been this way. In the 1970s, Americans' trust in government institutions shattered in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and revelations about then-President Richard Nixon's involvement in Watergate, a break-in to the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee and subsequent cover-up. But the Supreme Court long seemed to bean exception.On former President Donald Trump's watch, that viewwas to changedramatically. Trump kicked things off by promising not just that his nominees would beconservative originalistsbut that they would guarantee the reversal of Roe.With three Trump nominees on the court, the justices delivered the most conservative winssince 1931, according to an NPR report, citing statistics compiled by professors at Washington University and the University of Michigan.And it wasn't just the number of wins - it was how far to the right the court moved. The justices opened the door to displays of religious faith from public school teachers andcoaches, and an expansion of public funding forreligious schools.The court also hamstrung the Environmental Protection Agency and cast doubt on thepower of other agencies, created a super-right to bear arms that would make it hard to passany gun regulationsand eliminated the right to abortion, even rejecting the argument that abortion restrictions constituted sex discrimination in violation of theEqual Protection Clause- a claim that neither the petitioners nor the respondents in the case had raised.The message was clear: The court's conservative majority was here to stay - and making no apologies for the revolution it was working in the law, no matter how deeply unpopularit was becoming.By the end of the summer, thecourt's reputationhad taken a nosedive, but the conservative justices hardly seemed to care. They seemed convinced that they truly were insulated from the will of the people.It's true that the justices hold lifetime appointments - and that no justice has ever been successfully removed through impeachment. But historically, there were other ways to hold the court accountable - threats to strip the court of jurisdiction, changing the number of justices or even just ignoring the justices' rulings.The current conservative majority seems poised to continue making major changes. The court couldend affirmative action, furthergut the Voting Rights Act, givestate legislatures the powerto upend federal elections, furthercurb the power of the EPAand allow religious business ownersto refuse serviceto LBGTQ customers.The New York Times article on the court's alleged leak will deal the court's reputation another blow. Americans want the court to be above partisan politics (less than 20% polledrecently by Pew think that the court should bring their political views into decision making), but a growing number of voters think that the court is a partisan institution.Now,it seemsthe justices are not just delivering policy wins to one side of the aisle but have developed inside relationships with conservative organizations.At a minimum, doing so creates a horrible impression for Americans promised that the justices will be neutral arbiters of the law. At worst, it's a sign of deep corruption. (The Code of Conduct for United States Judges provides ethical guidance for lower court judges but specificallydoes not coverSupreme Court justices.)The court seems convinced that it can continue on its current trajectory no matter how unhappy Americans are. If that's true, Americans will lose trust in yet another institution, and the court will lose touch with the will of the people.Both of those things would be dangerous for American democracy. And so, for everyone's sake, we have to hope that there is some accountability for the court after all.Opinion by Mary ZieglerTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
