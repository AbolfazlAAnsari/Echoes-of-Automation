            "inputText": "We, a growing group of now over 500 academics and public figures on all continents, have signed the following open letter, calling on our governments to enact emergency basic income to save lives.We are living in unprecedented times - as theCovid-19virus spreads rapidly across the globe, it undermines the very foundations of the global economy.And, just as pandemics cannot be dealt with using ordinary public health measures, global economic collapse requires more than traditional welfare policies.Across the globe, businesses are going to the wall; jobs are being lost; the self-employed are without work; mortgages are being defaulted; savings are being run through; and rent cannot be paid. Societies where a large majority of the population works in the informal sector will be hit especially hard - beyond earnings, there is next to no safety net.Our entire economic system relies on continual motion and right now, it is grinding to a halt. Without drastic government intervention, countless numbers will suffer, businesses will close, unemployment will skyrocket, and the economy will go into a steep recession and possibly even a second Great Depression.It is time for governments to enact emergencyuniversal basic income, ensuring that everyone in their jurisdiction has enough money to buy the food and other essentials they need to survive.Alone, basic income will not be enough - migrants and detainees, for example, will need support specific to their circumstances, and evidently food and healthcare must be provided for all. But an unconditional basic income should play a central role in the emergency response to this crisis. Without it, lives will be lost.​Dr Sarath Davala, India Network for Basic Income, India                                            Dr Isabelle Guérin, French National Research institute for

As was indicated, 8,000 per year die from the seasonal flu for a point of comparison.Let us briefly consider the case ofChina. Despite no prior warning and an extremely high population density China has, at the time of writing, limited deaths to3,237. The number of new cases in China is now almost negligible. While fatalities might still increase within China, it is reasonably safe to say that they will almost certainly keep total deaths within their borders to under 20,000.Why then, if a country with 20 times the population of the UK can keep deaths to below this number, would we consider this a goalpost? It is the responsibility of the state to do all it can to protect its most vulnerable citizens. The government should set itself loftier ambitions than allowing 20,000 of its citizens to die.Alexis Gkantiragas                                          London NW5The NHS can't cope with thisThe government's announcements on thelatest numberof confirmedCovid-19cases feels meaningless to me given the crazy limitations imposed on who is able to have the test.When will Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak admit that the NHS probably does not have the capacity to enable them to follow WHO advice: test, test, test?I don't suppose it has anything to do with the NHS being on induced life-support itself since 2010?Eddie Dougall                                          Bury St EdmundsDelay BrexitI could not agree more with your editorial (Boris Johnson has another no-cost option to soften the blow of coronavirus - delaying Brexit, 18 March) and this is surely the only legitimate and sensible way ahead.The talks have been postponed and this country and the EU have a lot more on their hands than the matter of negotiating a trade deal.As you rightly state, it would be unforgivable to approach Brexit as business as usual and it is time the prime minister and the leading gung-ho exponents realised this.Lives are at stake now, not trade deals. Let's get the necessary perspective on this, and fast. We have been led by the nose by ultra-Brexiteers for long enough, time for them to wake up and appreciate that this is a worldwide Titanic iceberg and not a small inconvenience.Judith A Daniels                                          NorfolkToday's editorial in The Independent is spot on. Bill Shankly, the former Liverpool manager is reputed to have said \"some people think football is a matter of life and death. I assure you, it's much more serious than that.\"Over the last three years, for a section of the British population, it has seemed that you could substitute the word football with Brexit. At this moment of crisis for the nation, when we are literally talking about life and death, surely every organ and sinew of the state should be focused on attempting to reduce mortality and relieve the impact of the coronavirus. Anyone advocating in the next few months that we should still rush to get Brexit done would show a level of fanaticism and lack of humanity worthy of all our contempt and opprobrium.MT Harris                                          Grimsby"
