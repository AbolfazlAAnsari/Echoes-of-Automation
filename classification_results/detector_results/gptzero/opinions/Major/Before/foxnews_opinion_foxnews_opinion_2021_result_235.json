Hosting a remote morning show for WKAT at Pumpernik's restaurant on Miami Beach, King’s impromptu interviewing of unexpected guests -- including celebrities like Don Rickles, Ella Fitzgerald and Danny Thomas -- foreshadowed the format of his future legendary shows.UNSPECIFIED - CIRCA 1987: Lary King Radio and television personality on the air with the Mutrual Radio Network circa 1987. (Photo by Focus on Sport/Getty Images)Broadcasting for 64 years on both radio and television, King interviewed more than 60,000 individuals – everyone from presidents to prime ministers and celebrities of every age and stage of their career.King’s longevity was attributable to his natural gifts and talents, of course. He was good at what he did, did a lot of it, and clearly loved the craft – a key to any successful professional life.But it was King’s selfless and mostly agenda-free style of interviewing, along with a willingness to let his guests do most of the talking, that separated him from competitors and that catapulted him to radio and television royalty. In a day and age when many hosts leverage their platforms to pontificate, King was determined to ask short, simple questions – and actually listen with interest to the guest’s answers.CELEBRITIES REACT TO LARRY KING'S DEATH: 'A TRUE LEGEND GONE'Neither fame nor fortune seemed to sway his loyalties or loves, though King admittedly struggled in his personal life – marrying and divorcing eight times. He said he could control an interview – a wife, not so much. But he kept the same childhood friends all his life, meeting up daily for breakfast with a group of them at a neighborhood deli in Beverly Hills.You’d also be hard-pressed to have found a more generous, big-hearted guy.UNDATED FILE PHOTO: Larry King and wife Sharon. (Photo by Diane Freed)Nearly four years ago, I reached out to Larry to ask if he’d be willing to contribute to an adoption book I was writing. He graciously agreed, penning a wonderful essay on the importance of curiosity. The whole point of the book was that adoption touches every life because adoptees, from George Washington Carver to Steve Jobs, have changed the world and by extension, have changed you and me.Larry loved the concept and the book because in many ways, it complemented his fiercely curious spirit – always eager to connect the dots and learn something new.LARRY KING LOSES 2 CHILDREN WITHIN WEEKS OF EACH OTHER\"The more you know, the more you realize you just don’t know,\" he told me.Larry King’s long, colorful and fascinating life is a reminder of what self-improvement guru Dale Carnegie first taught almost a century ago – that you can get farther in life \"in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you.\"Paul J.
