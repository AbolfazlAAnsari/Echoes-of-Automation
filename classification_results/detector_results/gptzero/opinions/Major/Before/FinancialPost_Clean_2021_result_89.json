In the U.S., the peak(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA) was 13.5 per cent per year in 1980. This inflation was caused by a sequence of developments that started with the formulation of a new economic theory(https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Global_economics/Phillips_curve.html) named after its author, Bill Phillips, which suggested that unemployment could be lowered permanently by the creation and maintenance of a certain level of inflation.Through the 1960s the theory led policy-makers to increase the money supply, which produced the desired price increases, lowered unemployment and softened public opposition to inflation. But it also created a global resource boom and eventually led to 1973's OPEC-led oil price shock. Public concern over the resultant inflation was minimal because it was considered responsible for the beneficial lowering of unemployment. Politicians liked it as it generated much federal tax revenues needed to pay for the Vietnam War and the growth of the welfare state without having to raise taxes to pay for it.Eventually, the inflation reached levels at which serious economic misallocations developed. Unemployment rose and economic growth stalled, creating what became known as \"stagflation(https://www.thoughtco.com/stagflation-in-a-historical-context-1148155)\" - the unexpected combination of inflation with economic stagnation. The economic experiment that started with the deliberate inflation based on a flawed economic theory ended disastrously after a short period of success.We now are in the middle of another experiment based on declaring past laws of economics obsolete. Modern Monetary Theory(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/blogs/modern-monetary-theory-part-1-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-gaining-currency-in-these-volatile-times) argues that sovereign countries that print their own currencies can never run out of money and their spending programs need no longer be constrained by fiscal imbalances and debt since they can always be covered by newly printed money.The validity of this theory is questioned by most economists, but like the Phillips Curve theory, is backed by supporting evidence: recent fiscal deficits and money supply increases have not resulted in the inflation traditional economic theory predicted. The theory has enough professional and public support to blunt criticism of the unprecedented deficit spending by the Trudeau government on social welfare programs, the prevention of climate change, industrial subsidies and other woke programs - even if Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland has said(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-28/trudeau-s-finance-minister-rejects-calls-for-spending-restraint) she is \"not among those who think Canada should have a fling with Modern Monetary Theory.\"What have we learned from the inflation caused by the Phillips Curve experiment that is relevant to the current situation? The problem then was that policy-makers did not pay proper attention to the way inflation, once started, changes expectations(https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/11/30/what-are-inflation-expectations-why-do-they-matter/#:~:text=Inflation%2520expectations%2520are%2520simply%2520the,to%2520rise%2520in%2520the%2520future.&;text=All%2520else%2520equal%252C%2520if%2520inflation,one%2520percentage%2520point%2520as%2520well. ) about future price increases, which in turn leads to changes in spending that make the price increases a self-fulfilling prophecy. The dynamics of inflation are much like those of a wildfire. It starts small and rapidly develops into a conflagration generating winds that further accelerate its spread.Important, disturbing signs of developing inflationary expectations are here. The most popular hedges against the loss of wealth caused by inflation are investments in stock market securities but also assets in fixed supply such as real estate, gold, bitcoins, works of art and collectors' sports cards. Prices in the markets for these goods have recently been rising strongly and are at or near record levels.Opinion: Beware the siren song of Modern Monetary Theory(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-beware-the-siren-song-of-modern-monetary-theory)Jack M. Mintz: Once again commodities are coming to Canada's rescue(https://financialpost.com/opinion/jack-m-mintz-once-again-commodities-are-coming-to-canadas-rescue)Opinion: The Bank of Canada needs to manage inflation expectations(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-the-bank-of-canada-needs-to-manage-inflation-expectations)Philip Cross: An old theory says central banks are risking inflation(https://financialpost.com/opinion/philip-cross-an-old-theory-says-central-banks-are-risking-inflation)Larry Summers, economics professor at Harvard, former chief economist at the World Bank and former secretary of the U.S. Treasury warned(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpPg5fQTROU) in a recent interview on the Bloomberg network: \"We are heading for the worst inflation risk in 40 years.\" His views are shared(https://twitter.com/ojblanchard1/status/1358122336432648192) by Olivier Blanchard, a French economist who served as the head of the research department of the International Monetary Fund from 2008 to 2015. These authors refer to conditions in the United States, but these will almost certainly affect Canada, where Steve Ambler and Jeremy Kronick warned(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-the-bank-of-canada-needs-to-manage-inflation-expectations) recently on this page that the \"Bank of Canada needs to manage inflation expectations.\"If and when the expected inflation takes place, the costs of restoring economic stability will be high, just as they were when the U.S. Federal Reserve headed by Chairman Paul Volcker broke inflation and inflationary expectations in the late 1970s. Short-term interest rates in both Canada and the U.S. reached record peaks above 20 per cent. The prime lending rate in Canada hit 22.75(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IRSTPI01CAM156N) per cent in August 1981. Interest rates that high resulted in a dramatic collapse of real estate prices, bankruptcies of many companies and individuals, high unemployment, and much overall misery that few Canadians who lived through the period will ever forget.Of course, the views of investors and distinguished economists often are wrong, and the timing and magnitude of any future inflation depend decisively on the actions of central banks, which face an unusual problem. To reduce the size of the money supply, they must shrink record-setting commercial bank deposits at the central banks and not, as in the past, stop the growth in these reserves. Only history will tell whether the Bank of Canada has the tools to do this and the political freedom and will to use them. We may not have to wait long to find out.Herbert Grubel is emeritus professor of economics at Simon Fraser University and a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
