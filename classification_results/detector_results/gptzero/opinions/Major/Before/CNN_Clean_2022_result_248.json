Six out of 10 characterize the search for mechanics and technicians as \"extremely or very challenging.\"Airlines would like nothing more than to add flights to busy summer schedules. But accelerating labor shortages have forced them instead to pare back plans for summer to better reflect their ability to staff flights. Between March 16 and June 8, summer schedules - usually packed with more flights than any other time of the year - had been trimmed by 3.1%, based on data from OAG and Oliver Wyman's PlaneStats.com app. Given the importance of summer revenue to carriers, this is the equivalent of retailers closing some of their stores around Christmas.Because of these labor shortfalls, any disruption in the schedule - from weather to a delayed fuel delivery to an aircraft taking too long to depart from a gate - threatens dramatic ripple effects. Over Memorial Day weekend, for example, there were more than 2,500cancellationsat US airports, and the month ofJunehas seen thousands as well.Declining capacitySince the beginning of the year, airline capacity - the measure of seats deployed and the distance they've flown - has been steadily slipping. By June, capacity was almost 7% lower than in June 2019, based on OAG and PlaneStats.com data. That was mostly a function of shortages of airline workers, but also staffing difficulties at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, air traffic control and other vital airport functions, which are also contributing to flight delays. Some of this also reflects increased absenteeism because of workers getting sick with Covid.Delays and cancellations can push up fuel consumption and costs as aircraft idle on the tarmac waiting for a spot to open up for either takeoff or deplaning. They also saddle airlines with thousands of passengers who still need to get to their destinations - a challenge made exponentially greater with restricted capacity and short staffing.Worker burnoutThe labor shortages have been tough on workers as well. Most face substantially heavier workloads at a time when many are new on the job, and still responsible for ensuring that travelers follow Covid protocols. In 2021, the 10 largest carriers saw their ratios of seats per employee increase nearly 80% between February and July. Between April 2021 and this April, the number of seats per employees rose 17%, according to data from US Department of Transportation Form 41 filings and monthly OAG flight schedules viaPlaneStats.com.For airlines, the pressure on margins - at a time when demand has been strong, and people seem willing to pay higher prices - raises questions about what lies ahead for the industry, especially as global economies continue to slow. While higher fuel and labor costs are not expected to abate anytime soon, demand for air travel is likely to fall off as GDP growth declines.If airlines can maintain higher prices and resist bringing back too much capacity, then operating margins should be able to weather this year's inflation. But the worker shortages suggest some structural problems that will have to be addressed regardless.Opinion by Tom Stalnaker, Khalid Usman and Andrew Buchanan for CNN Business PerspectivesTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
