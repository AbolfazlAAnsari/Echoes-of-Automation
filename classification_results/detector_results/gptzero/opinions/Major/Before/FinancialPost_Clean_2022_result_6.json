When other countries' public pensions invest in government bonds, there's no effect on the government's net debt. There's both an asset for the public pension plan and a liability for the government. When net debt for the overall government is calculated they cancel.Not so when the CPP and QPP invest in non-government assets. So as both public plans have increased their assets, the net debt position of Canada's government has improved. But this is misleading: the assets of the CPP and QPP are not actually available to either the federal or provincial governments: they're committed to financing the benefits promised to retirees in both programs.When we look at total government debt rather than net debt - which essentially removes the assets of the CPP and QPP - Canada's relative indebtedness is among the worst in the industrialized world. In 2019, it was 86.8 per cent of GDP, which ranked 24th among 31 industrialized countries. Only seven - Belgium, France, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Spain and the U.S. - had a higher debt-to-GDP ratio than Canada. The IMF expects us to remain 24th in 2021, though our debt will reach 109.9 per cent of GDP.Jack M.

In the recent throne speech(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/blogs/throne-speech-exposes-trudeau-governments-economic-ignorance), which laid out the priorities of the federal government, the words \"deficit\" and \"debt\" were not mentioned once, even as Ottawa continues to laud our low net debt, which as we've explained, is misleading.Despite what Ottawa claims, we are highly indebted compared to other countries. That imposes serious risks on Canadians and the economy. At the very least, Ottawa needs to acknowledge the real state of Canadian government indebtedness.Jason Clemens, Milagros Palacios and Jake Fuss are economists with the Fraser Institute. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
