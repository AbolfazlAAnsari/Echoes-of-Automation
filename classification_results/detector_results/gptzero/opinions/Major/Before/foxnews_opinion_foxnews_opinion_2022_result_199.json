Accommodations can be made in athletics, prison systems, education, and shelters. Yet those accommodations would not be achieved by erasing women as a matter of law as would be done by the Trans Bill of Rights.One cannot be for both women’s rights and this vision of trans rights. One cannot stand up for women without knowing what the term woman means. Americans know what a woman is, what a female is, and what a mother is. Our laws should too.
