It’s one thing to support and include trans athletes. It’s quite another to demand that trans women have the right to compete in women’s sports, pretend that they don’t have an obvious physical advantage over their peers, smear those who disagree as anti-trans, and then cheer a win for \"equality\" while young women are shoved into second-place and robbed of athletic and educational opportunities.Pennsylvania's Lia Thomas waits for a preliminary heat in the Women's NCAA 500 meter freestyle swimming championship start Thursday, March 17, 2022, in at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.(AP Photo/John Bazemore)If those demands sound ridiculous, it’s because they are. This is exactly what unfolded at the NCAA championships, when Lia Thomas, a trans woman, defeated nearly a dozen biological women and won the Division I national championship title in swimming.Tragically, many of the so-called \"women’s advocacy groups\" who claim to fight for women have abandoned these swimmers, either because they’re afraid of being smeared by the Left or are complicit in their crusade.They may not fight for those women, but we will. LGBT conservatives refuse to bow down to the Left’s preaching that there are no physiological differences between men and women, we don’t believe that LGBT equality comes at the expense of desecrating women’s sports, and we reject the Democrats’ and the media’s dishonest smears that Republican efforts to protect women's sports are \"anti-trans.\"There are common-sense solutions to this sports problem. Some have proposed creating separate sporting events for trans athletes; others have proposed requiring trans athletes to compete in competitions aligned with their bioligical sex. There’s a way to fairly include trans athletes in athletics without taking opportunities away from others or demonizing the trans community. But radical Leftists won’t even let the discussion happen.Conservatives are waking up to what is going on. The Left is actively trying to rearrange our politics, our culture, our courts, and our schools to align with their radical woke views on sex, gender and race. It’s why the Florida law prompted such a fierce smear campaign from the Left; it’s why President Biden’s Supreme Court nominee shockingly refused to define what a woman is; and it’s why anyone concerned about the future of women’s sports is being slandered as anti-trans.From parents rights to women’s sports, these battles are worth having to protect Western culture, and LGBT conservatives will continue to lead the charge.Charles Moran is the president of the Log Cabin Republicans, the nation’s largest association representing LGBT conservatives and their allies."
