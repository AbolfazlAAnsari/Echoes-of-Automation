The Oversight Board agreed with Facebook on its removal of a posting with a Russian slur for Azerbaijanis.Mr. McConnell, of the board, said Facebook could decide that, for instance, posts displaying nipples in an anatomical, rather than sexual, context might still warrant removal, even when appearing to fall within the context of the Oversight Board’s intent.“There is no obligation for them to accept any or all of our policy recommendations,” he said.Facebook acknowledged as much, calling the board’s policy recommendations “advisory,”and saying that similar posts as those ruled on would be removed when “feasible.”“I can only reassure you that it’s the team’s intention to follow the recommendations of the Oversight Board,” said Nick Clegg, a spokesman for Facebook. The company was given 30 days to address the policy recommendations.The board also suggested that the company offer users more clarity about why their posts were removed, and about the ability to appeal decisions made by software to human moderators. But those, too, the company can choose to ignore.How Facebook responds takes on great importance in just under three months when it rules on whether it was appropriate, under the company’s rules, to have banned Donald Trump from its sites. That could have vast implications for how Facebook handles political speech, particularly when world leaders spew racial invectives or misinformation about the coronavirus or voting.But with Facebook’s tolerance for politicians and other influential users telling outright lies, it is easy to imagine the board’s ruling on Mr. Trump being narrowly applied so that, for instance, Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, can continue promoting unproven coronavirus treatments. The companybent over backwardto accommodate Mr. Trump until it was politically expedient to turn on him.Still, the very existence of the board marks a meaningful step forward for Facebook, which has resisted outside pressure to change. The company has the opportunity to show it truly wants to reform itself. For the good of democracy and decency, let’s hope it seizes it.The Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.
