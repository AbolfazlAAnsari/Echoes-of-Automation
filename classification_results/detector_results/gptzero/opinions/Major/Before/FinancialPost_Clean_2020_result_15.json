His findings were clear: Oberlander had been a member of a Nazi mobile killing unit (Ek10a) for a period of 18 months or more between 1941 and 1942; he had served as an interpreter in a unit whose role was to murder civilians; and he had misrepresented or failed to disclose his wartime activities when he arrived in Canada and later received Canadian citizenship.In his ruling, MacKay argued that had Oberlander been truthful, he never would have been admitted to Canada and would not have been granted citizenship.Following this decision, Oberlander's supporters and his legal counsel claimed, among other things, that the decision was unfair because it provided no opportunity for appeal. Events of the past two decades give ample evidence that this was not the case.Indeed, in the intervening years, multiple attempts to remove Oberlander from Canada have been thwarted, as his lawyers have variously argued that their client's behaviour in Canada, the health of his family members and questions of duress should be taken into consideration. Each successive challenge sent the file back to the government's lawyers for revision. The last challenge was rejected by both the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada.Now, with all avenues seemingly closed, Oberlander's lawyers have unveiled a new legal argument.In essence, they claim that MacKay was entitled to make a finding only as to whether or not Oberlander misled authorities in order to gain entry into Canada and later receive citizenship. Everything beyond that was merely opinion on the part of the judge and therefore is of no force or effect. They further argue that even if their client was properly stripped of citizenship, he retains \"domicile,\" and therefore cannot be deported.\"Domicile\" is an old Roman legal concept that predates government involvement in immigration. It refers to a fixed place of residence. It meant (more or less) one's primary place of residence, or the place with which that person has the strongest factual connection, and could refer to a country or territory. There is a lot of obscure law connected with domicile. Today in Canada, however, it is all irrelevant, since the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act has repealed the applicability of the concept, both going forward and looking backward.Helmut Oberlander is seen in an undated photo.Citizenship law is a very modern concept governed by legislation and connected to an international body of linked laws and treaties, and it is all that counts.A sensible view of the matter was expressed by Mark Freiman, former deputy attorney general of Ontario and former legal counsel and president of the Canadian Jewish Congress, who observed that this latest legal salvo cannot obscure the important truth that Oberlander is being deported not only because he lied when filling out his immigration form, but because he was found to have been complicit in crimes against humanity. He is subject to removal from Canada on that basis alone.So how was Oberlander complicit?
