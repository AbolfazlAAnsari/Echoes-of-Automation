But raising certification barriers too high affects real people and their families and puts a damper on the Canadian economy. So it is good that new Ontario legislation may help speed up licencing for skilled newcomers - though it doesn't go nearly far enough.I recently met Moez, a trained pharmacist who immigrated from India in 2015. Despite working two jobs packaging orders at restaurants in Calgary he was not able to afford the cost of re-licensing to practice pharmacy in Canada. Relicensing costs for internationally trained pharmacists range from $9,000 to $25,000, depending on the province and the requirements to be fulfilled.Such stories are common among immigrants. We've all heard of or met internationally-trained doctors, nurses or engineers who make a living driving taxis because they can't get the certifications they need to work here - even though we are facing severe labour shortages in critical sectors such as health care as Canadian-born boomers retire.
