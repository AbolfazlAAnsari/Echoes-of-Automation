            "inputText": "The significant increase in testing capacity and access to testing facilities are among the most important achievements in Canada since the beginning of the pandemic. We can now broadly test people in the community who have very mild symptoms, thereby initiating contact tracing on a large scale. With a national test-and-trace strategy, as well as the widespread adoption of public health controls and physical distancing, our rates of COVID-19 have declined substantially.However, as we head into the fall season with an increase in people developing respiratory symptoms that require testing, we must revisit the need for non-targeted testing of people with no symptoms. The justification to test anyone who wished to be tested was reasonable in the earlier days of the pandemic: we did not know much about how the disease was transmitted or the best intervention strategies, we were unclear about the relevance of transmission from infected persons with no symptoms and the extent of transmission occurring from it in our communities. We wanted to protect our health-care workers, long-term care residents, other front-facing personnel, vulnerable populations and their families with everything we had available to us to get through the first wave.Yet we have learned a great deal since the beginning of the summer. New evidence suggests that only 20 per cent of cases truly have no symptoms, and that these people are less likely to transmit the virus. We also learned that people may test positive for up to 90 days, but are only infectious during the first 10 days. As a result, mass testing in many settings when case counts are low has identified very few infectious cases, but instead, a significant number of cases that are not infectious. The latter often triggers unnecessary anxiety, isolation of contacts, work absenteeism with a potential economic impact on the individual and extra efforts by hospitals and public health officials to launch further investigations - all finite resources that were diverted away from the public health response.People have also been using tests inappropriately, often to assure themselves that they are able to participate in activities that are to be discouraged, such as multi-person gatherings, without adhering to physical distancing. Testing cannot rule out that people are going to be infectious a day or two after they get the test. Thus, the false sense of security from testing is counterproductive as it serves as an enabler for risky behaviour. These approaches have had a noticeable impact on the time it takes to process samples. Cities such as Toronto and Ottawa are only seeing 50-60 per cent of results returned within 24 hours.Finding unknowingly infectious individuals by testing people with no symptoms and no known exposure is like finding a needle in a haystack. In Ontario, as an example, data suggests that there are four unknown cases for each confirmed case. With 1,500 newly diagnosed cases over the last 10 days, we estimate that there are another 6,000 unknown infectious cases that could be identified if the entire population of Ontario was to be tested. At $100 a test, identifying one case would cost nearly $250,000. Clearly, this would be uneconomic, and most of the positive cases could have been identified by only testing people experiencing some symptoms.As fall approaches, cold and flu season comes with it. Adults and children will inevitably develop respiratory symptoms from COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, and will require testing to enable our public health response. With nearly five million children in school across the country and an expectation that they will develop at least two respiratory-tract infections per year, this creates the need for over 27,000 tests per day for symptomatic children alone. This additional volume of tests will result in backlogs in the system and contribute to delays in the reporting of results.Delays in receiving results creates the need for prolonged self-isolation or quarantine, which will prevent people from returning to school or work. This disincentive may result in people choosing not to report their symptoms and to not get tested. The delays and the risk of people not seeking testing jeopardize the effectiveness of the public health response by impairing timely contact tracing. At the hospital level, delays can result in the excessive use of personal protective equipment, hallway medicine and increased waiting times in emergency departments. For all these reasons, it is crucial that symptomatic individuals have priority and easy access to rapid testing and results. A constant investment into increasing testing capacity and optimizing logistics to meet symptomatic demand is important.Asymptomatic testing - meaning those without symptoms who have not been exposed, have not returned from abroad and have not been identified as part of an outbreak - needs to be minimized going forward in order to support our laboratories. If we continue doing so much low-yield testing, the timeliness of the results will suffer when the laboratory system is approaching capacity, which will impair downstream responses.And we should not wait until the fall to change the way we do things: every day, low-value testing increases the use of scarce resources, such as test reagents and supplies, which lack a firm supply chain due to international demand, and places more demands our incredibly hard-working lab technologists. It is crucial that the general public, workplaces and institutions understand that testing asymptomatic individuals who are unlikely to have been exposed is not a surrogate for safety and cannot replace other public health measures.There is a lot of talk about novel technologies such as rapid antigen testing, saliva testing, pooling specimens and the use of waste-water testing. These technologies all have potential and should be evaluated and tested as additional strategies above and beyond the testing strategy discussed above, and should be developed in parallel. While these novel technologies may allow broader testing of people who are at low risk of an infection, laboratory testing that is currently available should be preserved for those who require it most: symptomatic and exposed individuals during the respiratory-virus season.So going into the fall, let's be evidence-based and avoid testing if you have no symptoms or known exposures to COVID-19.National PostDr. Zain Chagla and Dr. Dominik Mertz are associate professors at McMaster University.
