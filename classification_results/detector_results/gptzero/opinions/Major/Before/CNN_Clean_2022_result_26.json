That revolution of values meant transforming the way in which institutions and people regarded Black lives. Jackson's position on America's highest court reflects an important evolution in democracy as we move, however imperfectly, toward King's dream of a new nation.Jackson promises to be a pathbreaking associate justice on the Supreme Court who exemplifies Black women's centrality to the hard work of democracy. The reverence in which her past colleagues,friendsandfamilyhold her illustrates a side of her personal and professional journey obscured by the messiness of the Senate confirmation hearings. Jackson's dedication to family, her candor in discussing the difficulties of attaining work-life balance while sustaining a demanding career and raising two daughters and her grace in the face of withering attacks deeply rooted in the country's still unresolved assault on Black women's personhood and humanity show an incredible amount of fortitude that places her in a longer tradition of Black women trailblazers, including Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman appointed to a federal bench.The \"revolution of values\" that King called for transcended the Vietnam War, racial injustice and economic poverty. King asked the nation to share a new story about itself. He implored us to acknowledge our past missteps, contemporary failings and perpetual hubris. King then challenged the nation to \"rededicate ourselves\" to building the beloved community free of racial injustice, economic inequality, segregation, hunger and violence. He remained the world's most eloquent advocate of non-violence. But he then urged the entire nation to follow his lead.America has comea long wayin the 55 years since King's speech. Some of the biggest policy victories of the civil rights era, including the Voting Rights Act, have come under threat from a new era of voter suppression. But Jackson's confirmation attests to the heights we have reached in the over half century after King called upon the nation to embark on a dangerous mission to recover its purpose, redeem the national political soul and restore the honor of American citizenship. The crucial need to create a new world remains as urgent in our own time as it did in King's. Jackson's confirmation -- like a rose that grows amidst the concrete -- is one of those beautiful moments that King called us to at Riverside and that should be celebrated even as we remain diligently aware of the journey that lies ahead.Opinion by Peniel JosephTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
