At the same time, developing countries are building fossil fuel energy systems at a larger scale and pace than the U.S. can offset our emissions, much less theirs.Whatâs more, Americans simply canât afford this false transition. A new Census poll found that 26% of Americans were forced to choose between basic expenses like food and medicine to pay theirenergy bills, while one in six reported the inability to pay the full amount of their energy bills at least once in the past year. This is unacceptable when we can affordably meet our energy needs through this countryâs vast natural resources.We donât have to choose between our economy and our environment. Innovation and improving efficiency in areas that work, such as nuclear, natural gas, and hydrogen, while focusing on large scale natural solutions such as forest management, tree planting, biochar, and precision agriculture will not only improve our domestic statistics, but will also provide affordable, reliable, and clean technologies for the developing world.To meet theworldâs energy needswhile being good environmental stewards, we must embrace an all-of-the-above energy approach coupled with robust research, development, and innovation. Putting all our eggs in the EV basket is nonsensical, wastes hard-earned taxpayer dollars, and is detrimental to our future. Democrat's EV policy is not giving us the best bang for our buck.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP. BRUCE WESTERMANGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
