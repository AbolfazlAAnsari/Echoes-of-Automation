How they are going to survive the next year or so with inflation predicted to be in the order of 10 per cent escapes me. Heat or eat will be the order of the day.If all the above comes across as \"poor me\" and I am berated for having the audacity to complain, as I should be happy with my lot after all, I should point out that we have paid into the system for most of our lives.Having said all that, it does not compare with the devastation that is ongoing in Ukraine and I for one would be fully supportive of foregoing the fuel tax cut and using the £5bn that it would cost to fund more humanitarian aid to that country.Scott CassieAberdeenG20 summitI see there has been an interesting change of tactic from Vladimir Putin, in stating he is still keen to attend the G20 in Bali later this year. For the uninitiated, this is pure Boris Johnson: promise everything, deliver nothing, blame someone else.He is as likely to attend as I am, and after copious rhetoric will blame one or more of the other attendees for being politically rusticated.Of course, if one were cynical, one might say the G20s achieve absolutely zero anyway and is just one big jolly; which is, without doubt, another reason to literally leave the Russian president firmly out in the cold.Robert BostonKingshill, KentRich men in their castleRishi Sunak has a fair bit in common with Edwin Chadwick and the designers of the notorious Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834.By ensuring that the level ofbenefitswill lag well behind the rate of inflation, he promises the most vulnerable in society the hardest of times. The existence of food banks all over the country shows of course that the level of benefits is already inadequate.To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter byclicking hereOne cannot expect rich public schoolboys like Sunak and Johnson to understand the plight of ordinary people. However, they may well feel a comeback at the May local elections and, almost certainly, when they are forced to have a general election.Rev Andrew McLuskeyMiddlesexRoyal tourNot normally one for writing letters, I'm almost (but not quite) at a loss on where to start with this.What were the Cambridges thinking when embarking on this taxpayer-funded tour of Jamaica? Yes, it's in celebration of the Queen's platinum jubilee. Normally I'd support this, as she's amazing.But a majority of people in the UK are facing huge uncertainty, unable to pay their basic living costs, and it's going to get worse before it gets better. How much will this trip cost?There's a war on. Women and children and being murdered in Ukraine. The timing here is a disgrace.And to top it off, didn't anyone in Buckingham Palace or William and Kate themselves do their homework beforehand? Jamaica has been making noises for some time about independence from the Commonwealth. So what was the point of the tour?There's a right time, and poor timing. At the very least, this was the latter.Mike StruthersOrkney Islands"
