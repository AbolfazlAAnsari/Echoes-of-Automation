Yet, as I started reflecting on the times when I had written off her opinion during decision making, I saw that things often didnât go well. I've since done a better job of honoring both of our perspectives. As a result, Raquel feels more respected, we make better decisions and both of us win.As we work through conflict, weâre learning what always works (humility) and what never works (pridefulness).Weâre picking our battles more carefully.Earlier in our relationship, I was willing to go to the mat about anything -- chores, church, restaurant choices -- you name it. So much of it wasn't worth it, and even if it was worth it (like working through wedding budgeting) we went about it the wrong way. Being willing to give up the fight -- or at least the way we fight -- reduces stress, brings peace, makes our relationship more loving, and with all of that, naturally strengthens our marriage.When I think about it, actually, our fights havenât been totally useless. As we work through conflict, weâre learning what always works (humility) and what never works (pridefulness).Â For example, last night, Raquel and I sat down to talk through our budget -- something I was dreading. Our financial discussions have often been as bad during our marriage as they were during our engagement.But something happened: There was grace. We agreed on many things, and where there was disagreement, we were able to move on without necessarily getting everything resolved. (Speaking of being gracious, Raquel even cut me some slack when I almost fell asleep in the middle of our conversation!)Thereâs hope for you and for us. With a little humility, we can continue to make progress -- even if it happens one fight at a time.FROM JOSHUA ROGERS   "
