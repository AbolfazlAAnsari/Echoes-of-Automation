            "inputText": "By Martha Fulford, J. Edward Les and Pooya KazemiThroughout North America, it is not uncommon to encounter parents who are absolutely terrified of their children contracting COVID. This is because many parents significantly overestimate the potential harms of COVID to their children.These parents are overcome by worry despite massive amounts of reassuring medical data that tell us that children are very unlikely to be harmed by this virus.Much of the blame for this can be laid at the feet of biased and distorted media coverage - coverage that should be deemed misinformation, but which seems to get a free pass from \"fact-checkers\" and from many in the public.We are not trying to draw moral or any other equivalencies to misinformation being spread by anti-vaxxers or COVID-deniers. We have many words of reproach for these people, too, but plenty has already been written about them.Nor do we want to single out any particular media outlet, because the problem is widespread. Further, we want to acknowledge that many media stories have been fair and accurate, and we thank the journalists behind those stories.Media reporting on COVID has been replete with doom, gloom and hysteria. A research report(https://www.nber.org/papers/w28110) by the National Bureau of Economic Research showed that American media coverage of COVID has a significant negativity bias, with 91 per cent of stories by major U.S. media outlets being negative in tone, versus 54 per cent for major non-U.S. sources and 65 per cent for scientific journals.This negativity bias is very apparent when it comes to coverage of COVID in children. While the death of a child is always tragic, stories of pediatric COVID deaths are often sensationalized by media outlets and elevated above other more common causes of death in this age group. Some media outlets, even when they admit that COVID deaths are rare in children, stoke an atmosphere of fear by running hyperbolic stories about such conditions as Long COVID, suggesting that large swaths of children with a history of a SARS-CoV-2 infection are condemned to a life of disability.Dedicated and honest scientists work hard to find and publish the truth. And unlike the scary picture some media outlets want to paint, the published medical literature on COVID in children remains very reassuring, even in the era of new variants.Delta in children wasn't more deadly(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.06.21264467v1) than Alpha; and based on British(https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1045619/Technical-Briefing-31-Dec-2021-Omicron_severity_update.pdf) and American(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.12.22269179v1) data, Omicron appears even less dangerous to an individual child than Delta. The risk that an infected child will be hospitalized for COVID appears to be very low, according to a pre-print(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.29.21261282v2) study that compiled multi-country data. Pediatric COVID fatalities are exceedingly rare, with British data(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01578-1) showing a minimum survival rate of 99.995 per cent and German data(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.30.21267048v1) illustrating an even better survival rate of 99.999 per cent. For context, COVID carries a flu-like risk(https://static1.squarespace.com/static/61e5afd7a33d334ec9f84595/t/61f9dd43ba8eb711feb3c039/1643765060412/Urgency+of+Normal+Toolkit.pdf) for unvaccinated children, while vaccinated children face an even lower risk.In rare instances youngsters can develop Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in the aftermath of a COVID infection, at a rate of around one in 3,000(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2780861) to one in 4,000(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.30.21267048v1) infections. But while MIS-C is a serious condition, American(https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/148/2/e2021051155/179791/Longitudinal-Outcomes-for-Multisystem-Inflammatory) and British data(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2783539) show that most of the cases resolve rapidly with no medium- to long-term sequelae.Some of the most sensational media stories relate to Long COVID, a term used to describe persistent symptoms after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Definitions for Long COVID include over 200 symptoms(https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Fulltext/2021/12000/How_Common_is_Long_COVID_in_Children_and.20.aspx), many of which are nonspecific and also common among kids who have not been infected with COVID. Media coverage would have parents believe that Long COVID affects 15 to 25 per cent of children who are impacted by COVID. But a careful and unbiased analysis of the published medical literature shows that Long COVID is uncommon in children. A recent meta-analysis(https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(21)00555-7/fulltext?fbclid=IwAR0w2VPzkZlA-if07LKhOy8Q7rgwc643XowZbKHVjFMv43API5TJ2tc-YYA#seccesectitle0021) on the topic, conducted by some of the world's foremost pediatric experts, concluded that \"the frequency of the majority of reported persistent symptoms was similar in SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and controls (i.e. children who were not infected).\" Another review paper(https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Fulltext/2021/12000/How_Common_is_Long_COVID_in_Children_and.20.aspx) came to similar conclusions. And, the largest study ever published on the topic was just released in the European Journal of Pediatrics(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00431-021-04345-z); it concludes, \"Long COVID in children is rare and mainly of short duration.\"Why does the media engage in such misinformation? We can only speculate. It's possible that some media outlets are themselves misinformed and are simply unaware of the published medical literature. It's possible that others are using scary headlines to maximize capture of eyeballs and clicks. It's possible that some are motivated by ideology or politics. Finally, it's possible that some others believe that they are telling noble mistruths on the premise that fear keeps the public more vigilant.But regardless of the media's motivations, exaggerating the risks of COVID-19 is harmful, given the profound negative consequences for children, parents and society. It engenders a perpetual and paralyzing cycle of anxiety and fear, with many unable to return to normalcy, and with some even developing COVID stress syndrome(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33660068/ ).Opinion: The wrong people are making decisions on school closures. Our children deserve better(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-the-wrong-people-are-making-decisions-on-school-closures-our-children-deserve-better)Opinion: Time for kids to get back to normal(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-time-for-kids-to-get-back-to-normal)Widespread fear has yielded fertile soil for \"manufactured consent\" to such ineffective and harmful policies as school closures(https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n521) and the masking of young children(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666535221001221) - COVID policies that have inflicted tremendous collateral damage upon our children, and disproportionately among those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds.The United Nations(https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/12/1107282) estimates that the impact of COVID policies will cost today's children and youth $17 trillion in lifetime earnings. That's trillion with a \"T.\" The incidence of such serious medical problems as Type 2 diabetes(https://www.diabetes.org/newsroom/press-releases/2021/new-study-shows-hospitalization-rates-for-new-onset-pediatric-t2d-doubled-during-COVID-19) and obesity(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34529635/ ) - with lifelong consequences - have dramatically increased. Mental health disorders are skyrocketing, including catastrophic increases in eating disorders(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2786919). Dramatic learning losses(https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/education/our-insights/covid-19-and-education-the-lingering-effects-of-unfinished-learning) have been well-documented and continue to accumulate; nor will they be easily remediated - if ever.We implore journalists and the media outlets that employ them to remember journalistic ethics and standards(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism_ethics_and_standards) when it comes to reporting on COVID. \"Truthfulness, accuracy, objectivity, impartiality, fairness and public accountability\" must never be set aside. We urge reporters to embrace nuance, balance and context when crafting COVID content, and to consult experts and doctors from all sides of the debate.To worried parents we say this: Consume media stories, especially those with sensational headlines, with a dose of healthy skepticism. Ask questions and consult the published medical literature for yourselves. And consult with your trusted family doctor or pediatrician to answer any questions you may have.While we all want our children to be well, viral illnesses, frequent colds and flus have always been familiar to pediatric life; but never before have they resulted in policies so severely restrictive and harmful to the lives and well-being of our children.We do not want to minimize the deaths and disabilities caused by COVID in some children. But it's critical that we recognize that public health is not optimally sustained by a myopic focus on one disease, to the detriment of all else. The misinformation about the dangers of COVID to children is more harmful now to children than the virus itself.As highly-published pediatric infectious disease specialist Dr. Shamez Ladhani(https://twitter.com/ShamezLadhani/status/1472622908526710791?s=20) has stated, \"Let's stop the scaremongering and get the public messaging right.\"Let's pull together on behalf of our children.Let's demand honesty and clarity in media reporting.Because our children are the foundation of our future.National PostDr. Martha Fulford is an adult and pediatric infectious disease physician in Hamilton, Ont., and an associate professor of medicine at McMaster University.Dr. J.
