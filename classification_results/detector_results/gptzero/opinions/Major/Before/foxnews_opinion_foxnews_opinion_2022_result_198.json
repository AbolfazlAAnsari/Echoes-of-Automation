The Trump administration’s decisions might not have always been wildly popular in the region, especially from the outset. But at least the Arab nations knew where the United States was coming from, where it stood, and where it wanted to go. Lo and behold, the frankness dissipated many heavy clouds of distrust and misunderstanding, which led to peace and prosperity.TOP FORMER ISRAELI OFFICER: IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL REVIVAL WOULD HAVE 'UNPRECEDENTED DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES’President Biden’s Middle East trip this week will feature stops in Israel and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. All Americans should root for the success of the commander in chief. But success necessitates concrete targets and metrics, neither of which have been set out.With regard to theKingdom of Saudi Arabia, getting the nation to produce more oil when the current administration has crippled our own domestic production would be a pyrrhic victory.With respect to the Palestinians, myriad demands will be made by them during meetings, but how Biden will respond remains unknown. At the same time, there has been zero articulation of our nation’s expectations of the Palestinians to earn the privilege of a meeting with the sitting president of the United States.President Joe Biden (C) is welcomed by Israeli President Isaac Herzog (L) and caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid upon his arrival at Ben Gurion Airport in Lod near Tel Aviv, on July 13, 2022.  (Photo by JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images)The Biden administration’sapproach is indicative of a misunderstanding of leverage. This lack of groundwork and transparency doesn't just damage America’s image in the eyes of the Palestinians, it reverberates throughout the Middle East. It sends an impenetrable message that will lead to mixed results, if not chaos and death.During the Trump administration, every single visit to the Middle East had purpose, and every milestone achieved unlocked greater potential for the region. Recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, acknowledging Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, bluntly telling the Israelis that they couldn’t be both tech partners with China and best friends with America all led to the diplomatic breakthrough of the generation, the Abraham Accords.The Abraham Accordsinvolve five Muslim-majority nations that chose to normalize relations with Israel in order to build a future unencumbered by past. An America First approach removed longstanding doubt from the region. President Biden has before him an obvious road map for success in the region. Let's hope he eschews partisanship to choose it over tired and broken ways.Aryeh Lightstone served as Senior Advisor to the U.S. Ambassador to Israel from 2017 to 2021, and was tasked with putting the Abraham Accords into action. He is the author of \"Let My People Know: The Incredible Story of Middle East Peace—and What Lies Ahead\" (Encounter Books, July 12).
