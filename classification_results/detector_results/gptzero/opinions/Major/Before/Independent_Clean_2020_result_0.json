This is at best ill-informed; at worst, some of the theories being peddled are plain crazy. The reason that antisemites quote these numbers is because of Kristallnacht, the act of violence against Jewish shops, residences and synagogues in Germany in 1938. The pogrom, which also killed close to 100 members of the Jewish community, commenced on 9 November - hence the popularity of this date among neo-Nazis.Robert Boston                                          KingshillThe value of the artsA Picasso painting, Bust of a Woman, hanging in the Tate Modern gallery, has been slashed. It is apparently worth (EURO)23m, or should that be was worth. This is worrying. Art and objects of value should be safe and, where needed, be protected. Given the number of recent terror attacks, how does anyone get a knife into an art gallery?But to me, a more worrying issue is why that painting is considered to be worth so much. People can pay whatever they think something is worth for whatever they want - but that painting would be just as good for $1m, with $20m donated to a hospital and enough left over for a few drinks with friends. Support the arts that give us beauty, but also support hospitals that give us life.Dennis Fitzgerald                                          Melbourne, AustraliaAn ode to 2020Delay your distress There's a wayOut of this messI have a dream thatWe have no leadersBut collectively getWhat we getFrom the pressOf a handsetFor every debateA yes or noWill improve Democracy's flowNo need to waitThe technology is thereGovernment by us allFrom the armchairIn this 2020 visionEverlasting referendumsFeed permanent swingsOf the political pendulumNo crap slogans allowedNo post truths (ie, lies)Set beyond party linesWe unite despiteOur ignoranceNow that'sA head of steamOf a dreamNeil Armstrong                                          Newcastle"
