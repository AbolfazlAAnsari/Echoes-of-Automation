France, then Switzerland, then Spain, then England \"lost\" on penalties. This is no way to settle such an important football tournament. Is it not time to have sudden death after extra time with one player per team being removed from play every five minutes until one team finally scores a winning goal?Nick EastwellLondon SE10Mask or no mask, sir?Perhaps to solve the wear a mask/don't wear a mask conundrum we can return to the smoking/no smoking era when the two camps were given separate areas in pubs and restaurants. Publicans can put the non-wearers into the small, dark, airless areas that they've not been able to use and still serve them either from behind screens or by any members of staff willing enough. And then the mask wearers can continue safely in spaced, airy and light areas without the fear of exposure. Everyone happy?Judith MarrisBathLong CovidMarie Sherman's description (Letters, Saturday) of her young daughter's experience of long Covid was heartrending. It should be compulsory reading for our leaders and anyone else who is considering relaxing their anti-Covid behaviour on 19 July.As Ms Sherman says, the number of affected children is probably underestimated. The infection rate of the Delta variant is currently high, and rising. There could be many more cases of long Covid about to be revealed. No one at the moment can know how likely that is. And it is the young whose lives may be most damaged.A responsible government would assume that the worst is possible and take precautions. There is, of course, a case to be made for taking steps back to normality. But it should be done gradually, with a careful eye on the emerging statistics. At the very least we should all be required to continue to wear face coverings in shops, health care venues and on public transport. Anything less represents an abdication of responsibility on the part of those whose job is to keep us all safe.Susan AlexanderSouth GloucestershireForgotten heroHow can all these thousands of words be written about Richard Branson's space trip without mentioning the man who designed this revolutionary form of space travel? Burt Rutan, \"the Magician of Mojave\". One of the most innovative aircraft designers of our time is again being ignored by a media who would rather fawn over a couple of billionaires.D.
