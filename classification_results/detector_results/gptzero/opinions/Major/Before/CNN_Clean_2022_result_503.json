They were standing against the hateful things that Irving and West actually said and did.It is right and proper to be angry when people are openly antisemitic -- even when those people happen to be Black.  That does not in any way mean anyone inside or outside the Jewish community who are angry at Irving and West are somehow anti or blaming Black Americans as a group. Setting up that false dichotomy (you are either with every Black person always, even when they are antisemitic, or else you are against all Black Americans) is not only wrong it is also both dangerous and stupid. It is dangerous because it continues feeding the fires of baseless hate, and it is stupid because it needlessly alienates natural and long-timealliesfrom each other.Chappelle appears to have a zero-sum understanding of persecution and discrimination. In previous specials, he railed against the LGBTQ community because he felt like the world cared more about them than about Black people.He said thingslike, \"Gay people are minorities until they need to be White again.\"The truth, however, is that it is possible for more than one group to be oppressed, and that standing up for one group when they need it does not take away or disadvantage any other group. You can be against homophobia and against antisemitism and against racism all at the same time, without in any way cheapening any one of them. Not everything is only black and white.It is also true that Chappelle seems to lack nuance when it comes to Jews and race. Just like there are Black members of the LGBTQ community, there are also many Jews of color, and Jewish people of all complexions have been consistently othered in insidious ways. For example, in America, Jews were considered non-White at times when Whites were being privileged, and today they are often told (by people like Chappelle) that they are just privileged Whites when they demand recognition of their struggles.The proper response is always to call out oppression in all contexts, not to repeatedly try and reframe every conversation as a secret referendum on race. Chappelle is a brilliant man with an important voice. He can and should do better.Opinion by Mark GoldfederTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
