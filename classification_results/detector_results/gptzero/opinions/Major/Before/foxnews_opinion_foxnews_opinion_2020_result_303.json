My church, C3 NYC, raised this question last Sunday as part of their series on God the Father. The sermon pointed out that, sadly, many people struggle to imagine God as a loving Father and instead envision Him as a harsh voice of authority. As a result, most people tend to avoid God in the very times when they need Him most. The truth is, God sent His son Jesus not only to save us from sins but to help us understand His nature. Jesus confirmed this in John 14:7, saying, “If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.\"Jesus was speaking to His disciples in this verse, but His words apply to ALL of His followers. Thediscipleshad daily face-to-face interactions with Jesus, so they would have “really known” Jesus, and thus, the Father’s nature. But for those of us who have not yet seen Jesus face to face, we can be more vulnerable to lies that the enemy would have us believe about Him. These five lies can be detrimental to our view of God, and in turn, the outcome of our lives:Lie 1: God can’t understand or relate to our human natureINDIANA PASTOR SHARES HOW GOD HELPED HIM FORGIVE AFTER WIFE, UNBORN CHILD WERE MURDEREDWrong!

Jesus experienced every type of temptation we face and yet did not sin. He lived a perfect life because He knew we never could. That’s why we should never believe this second lie:Lie 2: God wants to control you with harsh, restrictive rulesI won’t lie and say the rules God tells us to live by are always easy to follow.

He reminded us,“You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness” (1 Thessalonians 5:5).We must accept we are God’s children, and stop avoiding Him as a result of accepting this lie:Lie 4: God is so disappointed by your failures that He could never forgive youNo matter what you have done or how many times you think you’ve “failed” God, He will never stop loving you, because God loves us totally unconditionally from the day we are born until the day we die. He tells us in Romans 5:8“But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we werestillsinners, Christ died for us.”Unfortunately, rather than accepting this as truth, our minds often replay our past mistakes and we get stuck on the fifth lie:Lie 5. You can never change“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!” (2  Corinthians 5:17).God sent Jesus to die for our sins so that we may all walk in freedom and one day live face-to-face with Him again, just as He created us. As Christians, we have to stop letting our misperceptions of God and our identity in Him hinder us from moving forward to fulfill our God-given purposes.BY CHRISTEN LIMBAUGH BLOOM   "
