It's whether our votes will make manifest our democracy.When we enter the voting booth on November 8, we will do more than select a preferred candidate, proposition or ballot measure.

But our wins and losses are distinct from our work as stewards of voting. During Reconstruction in the American South, this distinction was well understood among Black voters who had been enslaved and disenfranchised prior to the Civil War. I reflect on this in my poem, \"The Family Vote\":\"Before my people were required to answerimpossible questions in order to vote:How many bubbles in a bar of soap?How many jellybeans fill up a jar?Can you prove that your grandfather voted?There was a time when black men could voteand black women could not, 1870, five yearsfree, and that vote belonged to the family.Our families had been sold apart and scattered,defiled, burnt, unraveled.

For years my parents and I voted at the same polling place in our neighborhood. No matter how early I arrived to vote, no matter how challenged my father's movement became in his later years, I could see from their signatures in the ballot ledger that they had always come before me.This unflinching commitment has since been passed to my own children, who are now old enough to vote themselves. They know the full history of how they have come by this right. They, too, have learned the lessons that history teaches.My mother still has in her possession a poll tax receipt that belonged to her paternal grandfather, paid when voting in Tuskegee, Alabama in the early 1900s.
