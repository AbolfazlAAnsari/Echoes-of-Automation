This as US President Joe Biden avoids the stampede towards a \"new Cold War\", looks to limited co-operation with Beijing and tries to avoid military conflict. Yet the Morrison government now has an investment in continuing bad relations between the US and China, and with it the risk of an inadvertent or deliberate outbreak of war. It willingly dials itself into Washington's martial calculations against the Chinese state. Canberra tumbles once more into an overexposed, lonely prominence.A day after US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that competition with China need not lead to conflict, Defence Minister Peter Dutton basically committed Australia if there is a war over Taiwan. Whatever restraint there was in the government's language on China has been abandoned. No consideration is given to the catastrophic effects of any conflict on the region.All prime ministers consider how their foreign policy dovetails with domestic politics. But few have allowed the political to drive policy in so one-dimensional a way as Morrison. He opts for confected grandeur over the grainy detail of how, for example, AUKUS will work.Everything is now seen through a \"China threat\" prism. Relations with the Pacific, south-east Asian countries and Japan cannot be viewed on their own terms. All are submerged beneath the politicking on \"pushing back\" against Beijing, on the apparent gratification of Australia being the model for \"standing up\" to China.Morrison initially rejected Cold War frameworks being applied to China. He indicated that the Howard tradition of pragmatic realism would be his lodestar. Even late last year the Prime Minister sought \"happy coexistence\" with Beijing.Lately, however, Morrison echoes the ideological strains of former Republican administrations in Washington, hailing a \"world order that favours freedom\". Then last week, he attacked Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese for \"backing in the Chinese government\". In fact, Albanese largely supports the government's policies on China. Bizarrely, Morrison conflated the opinions of Albanese with those of Paul Keating, even though Keating's recent remarks to the National Press Club were as critical of Labor as they were of the government.Morrison fails to understand that what appears tough on the home front can look in regional capitals to be a lack of sophisticated diplomacy. Look no further than when, before heading for Cornwall, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong reminded his Australian visitor that China is always \"going to be there\", that countries will have to deal with Beijing.The use of China by the Coalition in domestic politics, already dangerous, now verges on the toxic in its disregard for the effect on Australians of Asian background. It exists too in growing intolerance of alternative views on how the China relationship might be handled, and in the absolute judgments imposed on a fluid strategic environment.Indeed, the China debate here, for all its claims to novelty, echoes more and more the rhetoric of the late 19th century and the 1960s, especially its obsession with \"invasion\", \"threat\", \"subversion\" and \"containment\". Much of this flows from the continued emphasis that Australia now straddles the front line of a \"new Cold War\". Well may we rightly express unease at how China uses its power, but Australia must find the courage to look into the mirror too.Morrison claims the mantle of John Curtin and Robert Menzies. But in his recent fracas with French President Emmanuel Macron, his response carried a whiff of Billy McMahon's reaction to being hamstrung when America's China policy changed abruptly in mid-1971. Testy dissembling and blustery vacuity.A closer comparison for Morrison may be Billy Hughes during WWI. Australia then, just as now, had every right to be prudently concerned about the menace it saw in the rise of an Asian great power. And the strategic nightmares about Japan ultimately eventuated.The strategic situation then, however, was hardly helped by Australian bellicosity arising largely from British race patriot pride. Prime minister Hughes fractured national unity in a debilitating domestic debate over \"loyalty\": the result was an Australia almost totally unprepared for WWII. Reflect, then, on the unforeseen consequences that can occur when a ruthless politician opts for headlines exploiting hostility to an Asian power, rather than crafting a longer-term strategy for Australia's place, and peace, in the region.James Curran is professor of modern history at Sydney University."
