Before 1940, francophones in the province were less educated than anglophones. Foreign capital coming to Quebec tended to be directed toward more educated and productive anglophone workers. This created a wage gap in favour of anglophones, which in turn encouraged immigrants to learn English before French. At the same time, non-immigrant francophones were inclined to want to learn English, whereas anglophones had less of an incentive to learn French.Starting in 1940, however, francophone Quebecers began catching up in terms of education, thanks to a series of reforms that compelled staying in school longer. This favoured a shift of capital toward francophone workers and a reduction in the wage gap with anglophones. In 1941, a unilingual francophone worker earned on average 73 per cent of an anglophone worker's salary. In 1971, this proportion had grown to 84 per cent. By the year 2000, the gap had disappeared entirely.In fact, these numbers understate the pace of convergence experienced after the 1940s. The first cohort of francophones affected by the reforms of the 1940s actually showed no significant wage penalty relative to anglophones. However, these more educated cohorts only gradually entered the work force, so that there appears to be a delay in reaching parity. In truth, by 1978, there were no longer any significant differences between young francophones and young anglophones.As was to be expected, the rate of bilingualism among anglophones and allophones also began to increase over this same period. Between 1951 and 1971, the use of French among non-francophones increased by 10 percentage points. And after 1971, these increases continued at more or less the same rate. While Bill 101 - the so-called charter of the French language in Quebec - had something to do with this, the catching-up had begun well before the bill's adoption in 1977. In other words, the key to the growing demographic vitality of the French language was its increased economic vitality.Today, while new measures are being considered, why not draw the appropriate lessons from the province's past? Quebec's educational system remains profoundly imperfect. Francophones still lag behind anglophones in terms of high school graduation rates, which in 2013 stood at 75 per cent for francophones versus 84.5 per cent for anglophones. Why not tackle this problem, which is important in its own right, and in doing so also reap the benefits of boosting the vitality of the French language?William Watson: The ghost of Trudeau pÃ¨re(https://financialpost.com/opinion/william-watson-the-ghost-of-trudeau-pere)Opinion: Why does Ontario suppress the education freedom of parents?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-why-does-ontario-suppress-the-education-freedom-of-parents)William Watson: How Oscar winner Parasite undermines Canada's cultural protectionism theory(https://financialpost.com/opinion/william-watson-how-oscar-winner-parasite-undermines-canadas-cultural-protectionism-theory)A recent article(https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/8F2470A27916B0D810A8C22B19FBE3C8/S174413741600028Xa.pdf/economic-freedom-and-human-capital-investment.pdf) in the Journal of Institutional Economics shows that reducing taxes and regulatory burdens not only makes educational investments more profitable on a personal level, but also makes such investments more accessible to people lower down on the income ladder. Such an approach would make Quebecers richer, which would in turn make it more attractive for immigrants to learn French in order to interact with these richer individuals.Coercive measures have little chance of achieving the desired objective. It is the more roundabout but in the long run more secure path of greater economic vitality that will take us where we want to go.Vincent Geloso is an associate researcher at the Montreal Economic Institute (MEI) and professor of economics at King's University College, London, Ontario.
