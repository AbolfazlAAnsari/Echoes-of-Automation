The prime minister this week came off worse in a clash with Greater Manchester's Labour mayor, Andy Burnham, over stingy levels of state support for businesses forced to shut because of lockdown restrictions. Mr Johnson forced Mr Burnham to accept a smaller bailout package than he would have liked. But it was the mayor who sensed and profited from the mood of England's northern regions, which are fed up of having to suck up whatever Whitehall decides. Paradoxically, Mr Johnson harnessed such sentiments to win power last year.The prime minister's mistake is to resent the (limited) powers that the devolved governments hold, and the way those powers are exercised. He is wrong to believe that central government ought to take back control. His planning reforms have run into opposition because local authorities will lose discretion in a key policy area. Whitehall has neither the capability, nor engenders the level of trust needed, to run local services. Nowhere is this more obvious than in London. Mr Johnson has threatened to seize control of Transport for London if the Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan, fails to hike fares and extend the congestion charge to cover losses from a drop in passenger numbers. Cheap political shots do not amount to a strategy.

He underestimates how Mr Khan's weak hand is his strength.No doubt the prime minister does not want to give Mr Khan billions to keep the capital moving.
