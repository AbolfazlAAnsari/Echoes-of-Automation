            "inputText": "Before the Ontario government had confirmed it was bringing in lockdown orders to curb the spread COVID-19 in December, a vocal minority of churches made it clear that they would not comply with such directives. Several pastors and lay elders have since been charged(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/church-gathering-charges-laid-1.5859978) for holding in-person religious services contrary to the ten-person limit set under the Reopening Ontario Act.Responses to these acts of civil disobedience have been predictable. Michael Coren, for example, argued recently(https://www.tvo.org/article/the-lockdown-is-not-an-attack-on-religious-freedom-in-ontario) that \"freedom of worship has not been limited\" by the lockdown, and that such policies \"in no way [constitute] an attack on religious freedom\". Coren is at least partially correct. The lockdown applies sweepingly to sectors throughout the province, and religious services are among the only indoor gatherings still permitted after new stay-at-home orders were announced Tuesday.It would be incorrect to claim(https://twitter.com/kkinsinger/status/1346124063509508096?s=20) that the government is solely targeting churches, mosques and synagogues. But this doesn't mean that freedom of religion hasn't been restricted since this crisis began - far from it. It's wrong to insist otherwise.Under section 2(a)(https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/check/art2a.html) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, freedom of religion is engaged when the government interferes with an individual's sincerely held religious beliefs in a manner that is neither trivial nor insubstantial(https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2018/2018scc32/2018scc32.html#par63). The government's motives, legally speaking, don't matter. So long as Charter claimants are substantially prevented from acting according to their religious beliefs, then their freedom has been limited. For many people of faith, the inability to physically gather with other believers - even during a pandemic - will constitute such interference(https://vancouversun.com/opinion/brian-bird-the-ban-on-in-person-worship-continues-in-b-c-along-with-the-wait-for-a-compelling-reason-why).Yet some continue to assume that because many of the province's churches can transition to online rites or services without compromising their beliefs, this same standard must apply to all other places of worship. Such thinking profoundly misinterprets how the Charter protects religious freedom and trivializes the impact of the lockdown on religious communities.Randall Denley: Don't expect Doug Ford's new stay-at-home lockdown to solve COVID-19 in Ontario(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/randall-denley-dont-expect-doug-fords-new-stay-at-home-lockdown-to-solve-covid-19-in-ontario)Ontario orders residents to stay at home and declares state of emergency amid COVID-19 spike(https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/ontario-preparing-new-lockdown-measures-confirms-more-u-k-variant-cases)The question is not whether the beliefs of those churches which feel they must continue to meet are subjectively reasonable, or even whether other religious individuals would conclude that their freedom has been similarly restricted: all we're asking is whether the government has substantially prevented believers from living out their faith, however strange, idiosyncratic or downright fundamentalist that faith may seem to outsiders.None of this means that there will never be cases where it's appropriate for the government to restrict freedom of religion. Nobody, for example, has the freedom to physically harm another person in the name of religion. Section 1(https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&;rct=j&;q=&;esrc=s&;source=web&;cd=&;cad=rja&;uact=8&;ved=2ahUKEwjNj8-SqojuAhWPKs0KHdjxDqUQFjAKegQIARAC&;url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.justice.gc.ca%252Feng%252Fcsj-sjc%252Frfc-dlc%252Fccrf-ccdl%252Fcheck%252Fart1.html&;usg=AOvVaw0P7tukXfSsiXiNBbGBQLf9) of the Charter explicitly allows for such limits, provided that they are capable of being \"demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society\". That said, if a challenged law's objective can be achieved through a less restrictive policy(https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2015/2015scc5/2015scc5.html#par102), then courts may declare it to be of no force and effect.This is the genius of the Charter: it promises robust guarantees for our most fundamental rights and freedoms, but also recognizes that there will be times when these protections must be balanced against other necessary public objectives.In the few short weeks since the lockdown began, the situation in Ontario has deteriorated(https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/ontario-preparing-new-lockdown-measures-confirms-more-u-k-variant-cases) further, prompting the government to issue the much stricter stay-at-home order to curb transmission of the virus. Against this backdrop, it's become more difficult to argue that it's unreasonable to require places of worship to forgo in-person assemblies for a period of time. But such restrictions on a freedom as fundamental as religion must be justified with compelling evidence. And the evidence (or at least what the province has made publicly available) should give us pause before we rush to conclude that religious services were significantly contributing to the spread of COVID-19.The province's official data(https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data) confirms that, prior to new limits being put on gatherings, churches and other places of worship were not a leading source of COVID-19 outbreaks. This shouldn't come as a surprise. After the first lockdown ended, places of worship were required to observe strict building capacity, physical distancing and face covering requirements. Many implemented screening procedures and kept detailed lists of attendees, allowing for rapid contact tracing(https://ca.thegospelcoalition.org/article/churches-as-unifiers-should-not-be-penalized-for-their-effective-contact-tracing/) if an outbreak did occur. While the medical evidence is evolving, the general consensus is that where these measures are followed(https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext) we should expect to see reduced transmission of the virus.To be clear, COVID-19 is a deadly and volatile disease that has ravaged vulnerable and long-term care populations(https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&;rct=j&;q=&;esrc=s&;source=newssearch&;cd=&;cad=rja&;uact=8&;ved=0ahUKEwiQ_-2tqojuAhVFGVkFHXRZAMoQxfQBCGUwBw&;url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.macleans.ca%252Fnews%252Fcanada%252Fcovid-19-in-long-term-care-a-report-from-inside%252F&;usg=AOvVaw2HFEwlpcr28goH5mjPndD2). We know that this virus spreads through close in-person contact(https://www.pnas.org/content/117/26/14857). It's eminently reasonable for the government to require places of worship to follow evidence-based protocols which limit virus transmission, and to fine the ones that fail to comply. Indeed, some of the churches engaging in civil disobedience have continued - to their credit - to follow such practices.Justified or not, religion is clearly being limited right now alongside many other rights and freedoms, including movement(https://myemail.constantcontact.com/BREAKING--CCLA-launches-legal-challenge-against-NL-travel-ban.html?soid=1102696140331&;aid=L3MbDaMP-hk) and peaceful assembly(https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-freedom-of-assembly-rights-covid-19-1.5604491). Pretending otherwise is legally incorrect. To many churchgoers it is plainly obvious that their freedom is being restricted. One need not be a conspiracy theorist to expect that the government will justify these restrictions under the rigorous standards set by our constitution. If there are statistics that show modified religious services are riskier than the official data seems to suggest, we have a right to see this evidence.The Charter demands nothing less than a careful balancing of the benefits of the lockdown against the cost it imposes on worshippers. The stakes are undeniably high. One such challenge has already been brought(https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&;rct=j&;q=&;esrc=s&;source=newssearch&;cd=&;cad=rja&;uact=8&;ved=0ahUKEwiHmfWQq4juAhXZGFkFHfd6B5cQxfQBCDMwAA&;url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.cbc.ca%252Fnews%252Fcanada%252Ftoronto%252Fcovid-ont-church-1.5835451&;usg=AOvVaw34Irq8r7wzPcpKHA2uz0GT) in Ontario by a Toronto megachurch, and several of the churches which have been fined over the past few weeks have confirmed their intent(https://www.jccf.ca/justice-centre-to-defend-ontario-churches-targeted-by-police-for-church-services/ ) to fight these charges. We'll know soon enough whether the courts agree that these drastic policies are justified.Kristopher Kinsinger is an Ontario lawyer and LLM candidate at McGill University's Faculty of Law.
