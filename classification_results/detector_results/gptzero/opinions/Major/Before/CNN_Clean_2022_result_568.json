            "inputText": "William Carlos Williams is perhaps best known for the red wheelbarrow on which so much depends, but \"Spring and All\" -- the 1923 book which includes that poem -- is a manifesto on how language, through its own slow renewal, can recreate the world. \"It is the imagination on which reality rides,\" Williams wrote. \"To whom then am I addressed? To the imagination.\"In 2012, the Library of Congress cited \"Spring and All\" as one of 88 \"books that shaped America,\" which feels, as we prepare to take on 2023, like a prescient gesture, one that anticipated the power of imagination to create change and the role of culture in efforts to attend to the present while staying connected to the past and committed to transforming the future.Sometimes the past speaks directly from the page. AsLaura Beerswrote, George Orwell's perspective following the Second World Warforecast the realities of 2022: disinformation, \"reality control,\" and freedom of expression as the bedrock of all other freedoms -- making it the most important, and also the most vulnerable to attack and suppression. ForIssac Bailey, a free copy of Mark Twain's \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\" opened his imagination in ways a childhood stutter had kept locked inside -- andprompted him to speak out against ongoing efforts to ban books.Or it's a single word. Take Merriam-Webster's word of the year: gaslighting. Its selection was a statement on the precarity of truth in our lives, butNicole Hemmer, who wrote one of the first pieces connecting the term to then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016, objected to synonymizing \"gaslighting\" with lying without emphasizing its origins as a form of psychological abuse against women. \"This loss of context for a single word might not feel urgently important -- after all, words evolve as they work their way from novel to commonplace to, eventually, trite (as the word 'gaslighting' now feels after years of overuse). But in a culture where histories of abuse are regularly erased -- even five years into the #MeToo movement --the erasure feels significant,\" insisted Hemmer. Changing one word's meaning can empower women to claim their experiences and take one more step toward justice and equality.Consider also how cultural figures have loomed large this year in our most painful moments. AsPeniel E. Josephreminded us, cultural icons including basketball coach Steve Kerr and actor Matthew McConaughey spoke out after the massacre of 19 schoolchildren in Uvalde, Texas, serving in Joseph's words \"as courageous models for a progressive White male identity that challenges systems of oppression, speaks truth to power and confronts the divisions of our current moment by publicly highlightingthe gap between the nation's professed values and a more bitter realitythat allows 19 children to be killed in such grotesque fashion.\"And during the Jackson water crisis,W. Ralph Eubanksrecounted how the richness of Mississippi's literary and cultural heritage informed his conviction that \"Mississippi has something to say ... Mississippi matters.\" And yet, while in Jackson to celebrate that heritage, he instead encountered \"a new way the past and the present are colliding in Mississippi. Instead of the cultural charm and pull of this place that I love so much,I was confronted by the remnants of Jim Crow Mississippiliving on in the present.\"But if I might borrow and riff on Williams' formulation to look back at 2022 in cultural commentary, another part of the reason reality rides the back of imagination is because the latter functions as a source of joy and revelation that can invigorate the former. After the last few years, don't we deserve a little more of that?Social commentary on screen can be (gasp) funIn March, absurdist dramedy \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" -- led by Michelle Yeoh playing Evelyn Wang -- took the screen by storm, offering whatJeff Yangdescribed as a\"perfect metaphor for this thing we call Asian America.\"In the film, Yeoh's character \"can conjure up any reality she imagines, bringing substance to the outrageous worlds of her imagination by drawing power from the infinite diversity of her myriad selves -- making many into one, sometimes by chance, sometimes by choice. And we, as Asian Americans, are in the process of doing the same, building a cultural collage out of mixed media and lived experiences,\" wrote Yang.Summer romance took an unconventionally sexy (and equally dramedic) turn with Emma Thompson's \"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande,\" which chronicled her recently-widowed protagonist's quest for sexual pleasure and her first orgasm -- with a sex worker. This is a new kind of romance, affirmedSara Stewart-- a romance between Thompson's Nancy and her own post-60 body: \"Talk about a message at odds with our current political moment, where women's bodily and autonomy and power are under siege.\"Come fall, noted Stewart, it was time to be served some \"eat the rich\" satire in \"The Menu\" and \"Triangle of Sadness.\" Predictable, perhaps, given a pandemic \"in which billionaires got richer while millions died,\" she wrote. But while investing any film with \"single-handedly dismantling capitalism seems too heavy a lift ... Mark Twain said, 'the human race has only one really effective weapon and that is laughter.' We can at least capitalize, so to speak, on these films' painting their ultra-rich subjects as inherently ridiculous.We can begin to puncture the idea that obscene wealth is the ultimate American aspiration,\" argued Stewart.More on films that made a difference in 2022:Lilit Marcus:'CODA' didn't change my life.

It's more than a show about teaching, he insisted -- it's a show that, like its city of origin, \"teaches you. And one of its lessonsis not to understand anyone or anything too quickly, but to give each person time and space to figure themselves -- and each other -- out.\"2022 was also the sophomore year for Netflix's Regency-era hit \"Bridgerton,\" andHolly Thomasoutlined how the show's second season made her fall in love with Anthony Bridgerton like the rest of us, while stressing the importance of remembering \"just how rooted in fantasy 'Bridgerton' is.It suggests that a strikingly bigoted country -- one which failed miserably to accept a non-White royal in the 21st century, let alone the 19th -- has managed to dismantle structural racism in a generation, all because the king made a Black woman his queen. ... All this to say, literally nothing is beyond the redemptive power of love on this show.\"That's a far cry from \"The Crown\" -- now a fifth-year senior with a new cast -- where love is nowhere to be found and, as Thomas noted,fiction is rightly putting history in the corner. (In other streaming period drama-drama of the Regency variety, Thomas also praised the Jane Austen \"adaptation\" of \"Persuasion\" for beinga so-bad-it's-brilliant work of sneaky genius.)More smart takes on television:Sara Stewart:'Dahmer' debate is finally saying the quiet part about true crime out loudBill Carter:Trevor Noah's bombshell was almost predictableOlachi Ihekwaba:I turn to romance series when nothing else makes senseLindsey Mantoan:'House of the Dragon' isn't perfect, but it may be what we needA post-Roe realityEven before the Supreme Court released its decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case in June, women across America began speaking out about what the end of Roe v. Wade meant to them.Laura Beersshared that her own parenting journey could be rendered illegal or practically prohibited in states with abortion bans. Her younger son was conceived via IVF after she endured a miscarriage requiring a dilation and curettage procedure in one pregnancy and chose to abort another after a fatal anomaly was discovered. \"Each step in my journey to motherhood -- the D&C following my miscarriage, my abortion, and my IVF treatment -- relied on the good faith support and care of doctors committed to helping me achieve the healthy pregnancy that I so desired,\" Beers wrote. \"Recent anti-abortion legislation imperils the ability of doctors to provide similar care to their patients.\"Franchetta Groves, a student at Catholic University, wrote in June that the Dobbs decision didn't feel like a setback, but rather a triumph for those like herself who identify as pro-life. \"After Roe, I believe it will be possible for our nation to be one that doesn't cast judgment on women who become pregnant, butone that embraces them with love and compassion,\" she reflected.Dr.Mae-Lan Winchester, an Ohio maternal-fetal medicine specialist who works with high-risk pregnancies and whose patients have had to go out of state for abortion care, wrote in October that \"it felt like a slap in the face to be told by lawyers ... that my medical opinion is not enough for the law to permit me to provide the care I am trained to give. ... I worry that the next lawyer I discuss a complex case with will not understand, and that the patient who needs an abortion will be denied. I worry they will lack the time, money, transportation and support to get the care they need. ...I am scared they will die.\"Anxieties over the realities of a post-Roe America touched families who fear the rollback of rights around contraception and same-sex marriage. AsJoan Lesterwrote: \"Twice, I've survived the legal marital shadows,\" in her first interracial marriage to a Black man and in her later same-sex union to a woman. \"I wonder and worry:are they coming for my marriage next?\" They touched our daily lives as directly as the phones in our pockets do (asKatherine YaoandMegan L.

Hate and harassment, already a problem, skyrocketed.Roxanne Jonesdeleted her account on the same day Musk took over, after years of battling haters online as a Black woman in the public eye. She wrote: \"Waking up to toxic attacks on Twitter kept me in beast mode, on and off the site. That's what the Twitter-verse will do to you. ...

The wave of public grief was immediate, and the opposition to and conflictedness around that grief equally passionate. And in marking the seven decades of her reign in its unmatched longevity, from her 1953 coronation (the first televised) to her death at 96, \"Britain closes a chapter on its past, a farewell to members of the wartime generation that saw this country's finest hour, encapsulating as they did the spirit of 1940, when Britain stood alone against fascism, undaunted and unbowed,\" wroteRosa Prince.In her nearly 71 years on the throne, Queen Elizabeth stood alongside countless world leaders, most of them men, including 12 American presidents (she met a 13th, Harry S. Truman, while still a princess). \"Queen Elizabeth's sovereignty was framed by her gender even before she came to the throne,\" observedSarah Gristwood. \"For 70 years, the British people have grown used to singing 'God Save the Queen.' To sing 'God Save the King'\" -- as the British people will conceivably do for at least three generations, with Charles, William and George -- \"will catch in the throat for some time to come.\"For more on the royal family:Holly Thomas:King Charles' biggest problem isn't his crown, but his voicePeggy Drexler:Why 'Harry & Meghan' is a royal disappointmentMichelle Obama's new roleIn November, Michelle Obama published another best-selling book, and what made \"The Light We Carry\" fascinating, assessedNicole Hemmer, was that it was not a follow-up to her memoir \"Becoming.\" Hemmer classified it as a self-help book, except instead of a life coach, readers get a former first lady. Unlike Eleanor Roosevelt, who wrote an advice column for two decades, or more recent first ladies' children's books or policy statements, Hemmer wrote that Obama picks up where Betty Ford left off, sharing her own authenticity in service of a social purpose and building a brand beyond the limitations of her political role: \"She has an intuitive sense of how blurred the lines have become between not only the personal and the political, but between influencer and politician. In this book, Obamashows her desire to use that tangle of emotion and power to bring people together, but the ease with which feelings and politics now blend is also a reminder of how easily that combination could also be used to divide.\"Don't miss:Jill Biden:What Ukrainian mothers taught me about this warAdrienne Childs:Why the Obamas' portraits matterHow to fix what's wrong on campusThe dismissal of a renowned adjunct chemistry professor from New York University in October after a spate of student complaints about his teaching reinvigorated a series of long-standing questions about the modern academy, wroteJill Filipovic. \"Are academic standards dropping? Are professors and administrators too beholden to students' fragile emotions -- and their parents' tuition dollars? And what's wrong with kids these days, anyway?\" Filipovic argued that the university got it wrong: \"Whether or not [Dr. Maitland] Jones was an effective teacher for aspiring medical students is up for debate, but in firing him, NYU is effectivelydodging questions about the line between academic rigor and student well-being with potentially life-and-death matters at stake.\"When it comes to mental health on campus, the stakes couldn't be higher, notedDavid M. Perry, who classified recent lawsuits against Yale and Stanford Universities as a necessary spotlight on the need to do better at caring for students with mental health disabilities. \"The good news is that there are solutions,\" he wrote. \"Which is good, because the bad news is that as Generation Covid arrives on campus, students whose entire high school experience has been shaped by living through an ongoing global mass death event,the quotidian pressures of college life are only going to get worse.\"More sharp campus takes:Issac Bailey:I was the kid who stayed silent in collegeEvan ManderyandMichael Dannenberg:It's time to put an end to early decisionDavid M.

She also reflected on a recent conversation with friends, all of whom are grinding through a time of suffering, that brought her to tears. \"It's ok to be fragile,\" her friend told her. \"We're all fragile now.\" \"Yeah,\" she thought, \"andmaybe we're ready to be joyful, too. It's winter. It's cold. The holidays are coming. We're about to try to find light in darkness.\"ForAmy Bass, joy is going to rock concerts with her high school best friend -- and their two teenage daughters. \"It has been an amazing experience. I loved every second of watching our girls battle for position in the pit at Harry Styles' show. ... Indeed, just as we once joined the thousands of voices walking out of a U2 show singing '40' long after the band had left the building, our girls are part of a generation of fans that seems to look out for one another,\" Bass wrote in a reflection on Taylor Swift-mania and Ticketmaster. Getting tickets to concerts has never been easy, recalled Bass, who remembers sleeping outside in the cold to stay in line for tickets and getting Joey Ramone's guitar pick after her mom accompanied her into a venue at age 15 due to her lack of ID. But Bass argued this amazing generation of kids deserves more magic and less merch. She pledged to stay \"in the trenches with my kid,trying to support her love for music the way my mother did for me.\"We wish you joy and health this holiday season.
