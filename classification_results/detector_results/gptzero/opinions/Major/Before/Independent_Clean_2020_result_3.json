A handshake should be firm, not aggressive like President Trump's - although when meeting Queen Elizabeth it is probably appropriate to remember that she is 93 years old.Scott Morrison has met many people with a handshake, although some have declined it for various reasons and that should be their right. The problem as shown in the news is that he has then gone on to grab their hand and force them to shake hands, realistically an assault and certainly offensive. There have been a number of reports of his lack of empathy.We should always greet people with a handshake or its cultural equivalent and if it is declined accept that and move on. We need to meet and greet openly and with hope in our hearts.Dennis Fitzgerald                                          Melbourne, AustraliaBrexit trade-offHere is an interesting scenario. The present conflict between Iran and the US escalates seriously, resulting in the large-scale deployment of American troops to the Middle East. To legitimise this move, Donald Trump calls for support from other western powers. Not surprisingly they are reluctant to get involved. The US president then suggests that the only way the UK can expect an acceptable and speedy trade deal is if it accepts and joins his anti-Iran strategy. Would this situation be considered an early Brexit dividend?MT Harris                                          GrimsbySupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent eventsNot a third world warThe assassination of General Soleimani will not herald a third world war. The region has already and is still being used as the battlefield for Iran's proxy wars that has brought only death, destruction, desolation, diseases and the displacement of millions of people of what has been known as the most calamitous humanitarian emergency in modern times.Arabs have been the primary losers of Iran's ambition to fortify its Shia crescent and spread the ideals of its Islamic revolution throughout the Middle East and north Africa. King Abdullah II was the first leader to ring alarm bells. The last thing we all need is a third world war and more religious animosities that can burn the region and far beyond.Dr Munjed Farid Al Qutob                                          London"
