            "inputText": "From the start, the pandemic has been responsible for spreading not only a virus, but polarization. Beyond the immense toll that COVID-19 has taken and continues to take on health and human life, the unnecessary social division that has accompanied the pandemic is a tragedy unto itself.We are dismayed by the notable degree of skepticism and denialism about COVID-19. As Christians belonging to different theological traditions, we are especially discouraged that many of our fellow believers have adopted these attitudes.Moreover, as followers of Christ working for non-sectarian organizations - a public university and a legal charity, respectively - we wish to set the record straight for the benefit of our non-Christian peers. Our message is simple: there is nothing inherently Christian about opposing the COVID-19 vaccines.The Catholic Church(https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20201221_nota-vaccini-anticovid_en.html), for its part, says there is no moral or ethical impediment to taking the vaccines, whether related to abortion or any other bioethical concern. Catholics in Canada have been invited(https://www.cccb.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CLARIFICATION-CCCB-Statement-on-COVID-19-Vaccine-Choice-9-March-2021-EN.pdf) by their bishops to be vaccinated since the start of the rollout. Leading Protestant ethicists have reached the same conclusion(https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2020/12/73110/) on the morality of the vaccines.If the COVID-19 vaccines are ethically permissible, why do some Christians refuse to get inoculated? The leading reasons are well-known, and they are no different than those cited by non-Christians.Some people have never accepted the gravity of the pandemic, or even its reality. So it's no surprise that they would reject a vaccine that is, in their view, a solution in search of a problem.Others doubt the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. Among Christians who harbour these doubts, many fear the vaccines impair fertility. Despite the absence of credible evidence to substantiate this fear, it has acquired a firm grip on many individuals.Finally, some consider the vaccines ineffective because breakthrough infections occur, and vaccinated individuals can still spread the virus. This view glosses over the fact that vaccination greatly reduces the prospect of infection and transmission, to say nothing of serious illness and death.The overwhelming medical consensus is that the beliefs that animate opposition to the vaccines are speculative and lack empirical foundation. Even so, many who hold these beliefs are entrenched - at least for now.We do not expect to persuade them to change their opinions. Nor do we seek to antagonize or condemn those who hold these views. We have friends who sincerely adhere to these beliefs. We won't abandon them because we disagree on these issues.Rather, our main objective here is to clarify that the foregoing reasons for rejecting the COVID-19 vaccines are not inherently Christian. If Christians suggest that their faith dictates that they must not take the vaccine on any of these grounds, we contend that they are mistaken.Any person, Christian or not, can conscientiously reject vaccination. If a person sincerely believes that a vaccine will cause serious medical harm - or has been counselled by a qualified physician against being vaccinated - we would not want that person to take the vaccine under duress or against their will. Human dignity calls for medical interventions, including vaccination, to be voluntary.But conscience is not the same as religion. Most Christian traditions reject the notion that Christians can claim religious exemptions in this context: no orthodox Christian doctrine obliges a follower of Christ to refuse these vaccines. Where clergy purport(https://winnipegsun.com/news/news-news/springs-church-offers-religious-exemptions-for-vaccines) to offer religious exemptions to the vaccines, they have likely conflated freedom of conscience with religious obligation.Moreover, a decision to stand on conscience doesn't necessarily entitle someone to accommodation. Vaccine mandates are fraught with controversy, but they are not all created equal. Requiring someone who works in long-term care to be vaccinated and requiring the same of someone working remotely are not equivalent cases with respect to justice, fairness and care for others.With each passing day, the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines are, for the vast majority of people, further solidified(https://shenviapologetics.com/a-minimal-case-for-covid-vaccination/ ). There is no room for reasonable doubt over what these vaccines have achieved.There is likewise no room for saying that opposing the COVID-19 vaccines is an inherently Christian thing to do, since Christians, as a matter of religious fidelity, are free(https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/a-reason-to-be-vaccinated-freedom) to take these vaccines.Scripture calls Christians to exercise their freedom for the edification and benefit of others. In his letter to the Galatians, the Apostle Paul wrote(https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205%3A13&;version=ESV) that, \"You were called to freedom ... only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.\"Paul's appeal was radical at the time. It remains radical today. We are most free not when we love ourselves, but when we love our neighbour.Deciding whether to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, as with any exercise of Christian freedom, requires us to discern what loving our neighbour entails. For us, this decision was straightforward.Pope Francis put it well when he described(https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/08/18/1028740057/in-a-message-to-americans-pope-francis-says-getting-vaccinated-is-an-act-of-love) vaccination against COVID-19 as a \"simple but profound way of promoting the common good and caring for each other, especially the most vulnerable.\" Taking the vaccine, he said, is an \"act of love.\"We couldn't agree more: vaccination against COVID-19 is a noble exercise of our freedom. It is a simple yet profound act of love.National PostBrian Bird is an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia's Allard School of Law.
