The liberal newspaper’s op-ed writers omitted all of those facts, of course, in order to frame Rand as a human being somehow deserving of pain and suffering.LEE ZELDIN ATTACK SUSPECT ARRESTED ON FEDERAL ASSAULT CHARGEThe writers of the op-ed not only lied about and justified Rand’s assault, but claimed thatour mob attack in Washington, D.C.in 2020 was the equivalent of being \"yelled at.\"There are over nine minutes of live-streamed video of the two of us being literally held hostage behind only two brave police officers as we were surrounded, spit on, threatened, pushed and splattered with liquids following President Trump’s speech at the Republican National Convention.  We were completely immobile, unable to move out of the maelstrom of hatred and threats.FLASHBACK: SEN. RAND PAUL: MY WIFE AND I WERE ATTACKED BY A MOB — DEMS WOULD WORSEN PROBLEM BY BOWING TO RIOTERSThe police desperately radioed for reinforcement and it was only after four more officers arrived to forcibly push back the mob with bikes that we were finally able to move within their protective phalanx to safety.This encounter has been shown on video worldwide. Yet the liberal media continues to spread demonstrably provable falsehoods in its ongoing effort to discredit people like my husband and other conservatives who don’t toe the liberal line.So many of theliberal media outletsare everything they purport to despise. They foment rage-politics and refuse to allow a civilized airing of both sides of a debate.They encourage juicy, false narratives of conflict that in turn stoke violence of the kind that has resulted in Rand being shot at by a far-left lunatic; weekly death threats to his office; and terrorist tactics such as fake anthrax powder and death letters sent to our home.FILE -- Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul appears on \"Hannity\" on October 5, 2021(Fox News)Even once reputablenews sources like the Associated Press(AP) have lowered their journalistic standards to accommodate the woke mob, trading objectivity for partisan minimization.AfterRand and I were mobbedoutside the RNC, the AP headline was:  \"Rand Paul claims, without evidence, that he was mobbed in DC.\" Despite literal video evidence, the AP felt compelled to write such a lie in order to minimize violence against conservatives.  Responding to the video images of a police officer nearly knocked to his feet as he pressed back against the mob, the AP described the police officer as being merely \"jostled.\" Downstream media outlets then repeated the lie.The Democrats are cultivating a dangerous political environment by waging their culture war through once trusted staples of American media. Local news used to be an institution Americans trusted, but too many outlets in Democrat-run cities and elsewhere have abdicated their duty to responsible journalism and eroded that faith.\"Liberal media outlets that continue to traffic in hatred and misinformation endanger my husband, my family, and countless other people who serve in public office. And that should alarm every American.Kelley Paul and her husband, Senator Rand Paul reside in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where they are members of Broadway United Methodist Church.
