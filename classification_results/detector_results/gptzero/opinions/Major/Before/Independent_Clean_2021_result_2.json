The pandemic must be such an annoying distraction for him.David LowndesSoberton, HampshireTreat us like adultsAfter a year of obfuscation, half-truths, lies and deceits, we need our prime minister to reinvent himself and do those basic things that one would expect of a leader.Quite simply, Mr Johnson, do not make wild, unsubstantiated promises like being “world beating” or “oven ready” and so on; start treating us like intelligent adults. Don’t tell us how everything will be back to normal by April or next summer when you have no evidence for such claims; just provide us with some assurance that you are working to a strategic plan and tell us clearly how it will work.Start dealing in details: tell us exactly how many vaccinations have been administered, to whom they are being given, how long it will take to safeguard the most vulnerable and what the successive next steps will be.Of course, planning ahead has never been his government’s strong point; hence the catalogue of U-turns to which we have been subjected that have made it nigh on impossible for those in the front line of health, education and business to plan ahead themselves.It’s time for the prime minister to break the habits of a lifetime: to stop promising that on which he knows he cannot deliver and start telling the hard truths, even when they are painful to himself and others. Better still, it might be advantageous for him to start putting the needs of others before his own.Graham PowellCirencester, GloucestershireRead MoreThe government needs to explain the vaccination process with clarityThe public shouldn’t take the fall for the government’s bunglingVan-Tam defends controversial vaccine second dose delay planHundreds of fines issued as new year revellers flout rules"
