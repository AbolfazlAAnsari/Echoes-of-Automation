David Attenborough, among others, has warned that the UK must take radical action to meet its climate change targets. In order to do this, we will need totransform our economiescompletely, away from fossil-fuel energy and land-intensive products, towards low-carbon and efficient ones.Any government statement that such a transformation can be done without affecting our consumption is without a basis in reality.Moreandmoreresearchdemonstrates that reducing energy demand holds the key to rapid emissions reductions. These scenarios do not rely, as do many others (including the CCC'sNet Zeroreport), on large quantities of carbon removal from the atmosphere after it has been emitted (another speculative, costly and risky techno-fix). Even the CCC'sNet Zeroreport calls for reductions in transport energy as well as in meat consumption.Instead of bailing out aviation, the most carbon-intensive form of transport, which is disproportionately used by the wealthiest sections of the population, the UK government should be investing heavily in low-carbon public transit for use by all of its citizens.Subsidising short-haul flights (as the government has just done to the tune of £106m for the benefit of Flybe) and misleading the public on the necessary scale of action exacerbates the climate emergency rather than acting on it, and demonstrates a tragic failure of leadership - especially since the UK is hosting the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow later this year.Professor Julia Steinberger, University of LeedsDr Stuart Capstick, Cardiff UniversityDr Milena Buchs, University of LeedsProfessor Kevin Anderson, University of ManchesterProfessor Tim Jackson, University of Surrey                                          Dr James Dyke, University of ExeterUnintelligentThe US Senator Tom Cotton has tabled a bill to ban intelligence sharing with the UK if Britain goes ahead with installing Huawei telecoms equipment. Given that US intelligence failed to predict Pearl Harbour, Stalin's atomic bomb, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the 9/11 attacks, it doesn't sound like we're missing much.David Buttery                                          Douglas, Isle of ManThe final countdownOf course Big Ben should ring out at midnight on 31 January. It should toll once for each year of our membership of the EU to mark the end of the greatness of Great Britain and the unity of the United Kingdom.The date should henceforth be known as the Day of the Lemmings. I very much hope that in my lifetime I see the chief lemming replaced by a statesman who makes the effort required to understand all the issues that need to be addressed so urgently and who leads a team to develop policies that are properly thought through. Only then can we hope to restore the greatness and unity of our small kingdom.Jon Hawksley                                          LondonBoris in ScotlandThe news that the prime minister of the UK will be in Scotland more frequently has already been met with predictable derision by the SNP.Their Scotland is part of England's \"inner empire\". It helps to stoke up difference, and build the imagined community that they so desperately require, even though for large parts of Scotland's existence, loyalty would have been familial rather than national. Their separatist Scotland isn't one known to history.However, it is quite easy to have a dual nationality of Scottish and British. Scotland has done well from the union and the UK has benefited handsomely through our industry and inventions (at least until the SNP's reforms of the education system).The PM has a bonhomie lacking in Scottish political culture at the moment. Hopefully, he can bring this north along with a gentle reminder of the benefits of the union.David Bone                                          Girvan, South Ayrshire, ScotlandAn end to pointless titlesPlease could someone explain to me why Harry had to become the Duke of Sussex and William the Duke of Cambridge? I note that Harry is still going to be the Duke of Sussex if not an HRH. And why do we still have anachronistic things like Member of the British Empire. In the Netherlands, as far as I know, there is just one such title - the Oranje Lint. Why does Britain still need all these various titles? If we want equality in this country many of them ought to be scrapped.Ian K Watson                                          CarlisleSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent eventsTrump's slogan or a new eraJust as Johnson's meaningless Brexit blether morphed into \"get it done\", Trump seems to have a new, ridiculous slogan.At Trump's neverending rallies, cries of \"build the wall\" and claims that Mexico will pay for the wall have fallen eerily silent. Even \"lock her up\" has lost its energy since the only people getting locked up are the endless line of Trump criminals.Oddly - it sounds as if the new Trump slogan will be \"Trump will make your dishwasher wetter\".Amanda Baker                                          Edinburgh                     , Scotland"
