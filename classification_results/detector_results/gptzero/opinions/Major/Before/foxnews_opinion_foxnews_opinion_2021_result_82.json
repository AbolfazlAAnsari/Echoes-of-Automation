We have also worked hard with counselors to provide services for substance abusers, leading the nation in decreasing the number of deaths from overdose by 15.9%.FAUCI TELLS STURGIS MOTORCYCLE RALLY ATTENDEES HEALTH CRISIS 'SUPERSEDES' NEED TO DO 'WHAT YOU WANT TO'These are all signs that what we are doing in South Dakota is working and helping our citizens.And yet, bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., and the media cast aspersions on the Sturgis Rally while ignoring concertgoers, lavish birthday parties and the continuing crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.STURGIS, SOUTH DAKOTA - AUGUST 09: Governor Kristi Noem of South Dakota (R) poses for pictures at the Sturgis Buffalo Chip campground after riding in the Legends Ride for charity on August 09, 2021 near Sturgis, South Dakota.

It’s a failure in leadership on their part and why more and more Americans are fleeing big cities and blue states for places like South Dakota.As South Dakota’s governor, I have remained within the bounds of my authority and empowered citizens and businesses to make decisions for themselves. Rather than mandating they do as I say, I have chosen to let people take personal responsibility for decisions the government has no authority to make.There's a risk associated with everything that we do in life. Bikers like those attending the Rally this year get that better than anyone.It's no surprise that when I rode my horse through downtown Deadwood at the start of the Legends Ride on Monday, I was greeted with cheers for freedom and for the American flag I carried.At that same event, we auctioned off a painting and that flag I carried for a total of $80,000 to support the Treasured Lives charity, which helps victims of human trafficking.This trip to Sturgis and the Rally was one to remember. When the auction was over, I hopped on a motorcycle and helped lead 300 bikers on a ride from Deadwood to the Buffalo Chip in Sturgis, where the celebration of freedom continued.Under God, the people rule – and ride free on the open roads of South Dakota!CLICK HERE FOR MORE ON GOV.
