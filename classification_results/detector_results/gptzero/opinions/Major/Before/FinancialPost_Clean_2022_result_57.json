But then why does she think it's responsible to add even more fiscal stimulus, as she did in her April budget, a policy choice that is sure to invite a stronger Bank of Canada response, risking both recession and a further rise in debt-to-GDP since government borrows even more in a slowdown and, in a true recession, GDP declines.(A technical point: In her Toronto speech, Minister Freeland suggested her fiscal plan to keep debt-to-GDP declining meant she was not adding stimulus to the economy. But that's nonsense. It's true that stimulus measures that increase debt by less than the growth of GDP will cause the ratio to decline but to describe such a phenomenon as the withdrawal of stimulus is just bizarre.)Brett Skinner: New drug price controls are not evidence-based(https://financialpost.com/opinion/brett-skinner-new-drug-price-controls-are-not-evidence-based)Franco Terrazzano: Nothing prudent about Trudeau government's budgeting(https://financialpost.com/opinion/franco-terrazzano-nothing-prudent-about-trudeau-governments-budgeting)Peter Shawn Taylor: Ottawa's national private-sector childcare destruction program(https://financialpost.com/opinion/peter-shawn-taylor-ottawas-national-private-sector-childcare-destruction-program)One of the more curious aspects of the government's use of the debt-to-GDP ratio is as a guideline for its tax and spending policies. The assumption seems to be that if the economy motors along at a reasonable pace and debt-to-GDP is not particularly worrisome to financial markets, then the budget need never be balanced again. Debt can grow at the same rate as GDP without worry. The government can spend as much as it wants so long as the growth rate of the debt does not exceed the growth rate of the economy, thus keeping debt-to-GDP declining or constant.That does not mean that debt need never be paid, only that we shift the debt burden to future generations - and shift the financial risks to future generations as well. Of course, the longer into the future we kick this can down the road, the greater will be the financial hardships borne by whatever generation experiences recession and/or significantly higher interest rates. It's understandable why the government might want to borrow heavily when interest rates are at emergency lows: when rates are near zero the annual debt service costs that factor into deficit calculations are minuscule relative to the program being financed. But when interest rates return to more normal levels or higher that's when the chickens do come home to roost. How can this possibly be described as responsible fiscal policy?Use of the debt-to-GDP as a guideline for fiscal policy is completely without merit. New initiatives, be they spending or tax, should be judged by the hard work of calculating their respective costs and benefits. The impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio is an important consideration when the ratio is at or near worrisome levels, but otherwise should never be a deciding factor of merit.This government came through the pandemic with much to be proud of. The economy was performing strongly, an economic disaster had been avoided, and Canadians were sitting on piles of savings (albeit produced in part by overly generous initiatives by all levels of government). The last thing we needed was further stimulus measures to further encourage an already nervous Bank of Canada.We have seen past governments who missed their debt-to-GDP targets be very forgiving of their errors and promise solemnly to do better in future, only to have it happen again. There is a high probability that Freeland is on that same path, a more worrisome development this time because debt-to-GDP is so high. A more responsible approach, one that replaces new fiscal measures with actions to reduce debt, could sharply reduce the fiscal risk she is running.Financial PostLloyd Atkinson is former chief economist at the Bank of Montreal. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
