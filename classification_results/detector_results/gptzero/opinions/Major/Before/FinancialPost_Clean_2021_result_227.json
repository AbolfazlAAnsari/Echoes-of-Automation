            "inputText": "\"Men cannot improve a society by setting fire to it: they must seek out its old virtues, and bring them back into the light.\" So wrote Russell Kirk, author of The Conservative Mind, in 1953. A fire can warm our hands and hearts - or devour a forest or church: 2021 saw its share of both. At the end of this year, I am a tired, dismayed mom. Facing what feels like ongoing government fiat \"for my own good,\" my theme for 2022 is rekindling old virtues to survive a flood of ineffective government action.Families in Ontario, where I live, have struggled. We have the dubious distinction of enduring one of the longest school closures of any jurisdiction in North America. Many parents, particularly mothers, quit paid work or lost aspects of their sanity in juggling waged work and home work. In my view, parents in general and mothers in particular should never be coerced in any direction, either to full-time mothering or to waged work. Instead, families that are (we hope) embedded in functioning extended communities should be free to make their own decisions about what works for them. In 2021, it hasn't always been the case that choices were freely made. It was a year to grit one's teeth and power through.That said, instead of thanking all parents for rising to the task however they could, some commentators saw quitting the paid workforce even temporarily as a failure. Widespread discussion of a \"she-cession\" highlights the prevailing government view that all Canadian citizens - even the mothers of young children - must be taxable, ideally on full-time hours. With businesses needing workers and inflation and interest rates rising as we head into next year, the tendency to drape what are actually economic concerns in a mantle of \"helping families\" will only grow.That is a key problem with national daycare, one of 2021's major policy concerns. A hundred different politicians of many political stripes all claim subsidized child-care spaces \"help the economy.\" But Quebec, where this kind of child care has been available for 20 years, has excelled at neither child care nor the economy. Only a minority of its families ever access the kind of care the government is subsidizing. And they're typically wealthier, educated families - not the kind of people who need help - who out-manoeuvre others for cheap spaces. Thus 2021 saw a concerted effort to ensure an inefficient, expensive child-care subsidy for the middle class that, if it's allowed to, will grow to consume billions more dollars than are currently allocated to it.The Capitalist Manifesto: Terence Corcoran on why capitalists need to answer Piketty, the world's most dangerous socialist(https://financialpost.com/opinion/the-capitalist-manifesto-terence-corcoran-on-why-capitalists-need-to-answer-piketty)Philip Cross: A lump of hydrocarbon you really want in your stocking(https://financialpost.com/opinion/philip-cross-a-lump-of-hydrocarbon-you-really-want-in-your-stocking)Opinion: Happy Festivus (for the rest of us)!(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-happy-festivus-for-the-rest-of-us)2021 saw record numbers of politicians bouncing from one poll-driven policy to another, sometimes in just hours. On April 16 the Ontario government put the province's playgrounds behind yellow tape - for the second time in the pandemic. A collective blood pressure spike led immediately to parent-led petitions and the policy's retraction the very next day. Later we'd have to fight for splash pads to stay open. Even now, parents face the possibility of extended school closures after the Christmas break.The largely unremarked-on ironies in all this mess have attracted my attention. We will protect the elderly, they tell us, while expanding assisted suicide. We will empower women, but vote down a private member's bill outlawing female feticide. We in Ottawa will spend almost two years protecting your health but will not increase health care funding for the provinces or consider necessary changes to the system. We will never tolerate the divided society that vaccine passports would create, until we embrace them. Having squandered our trust, governments turned to coercion.But all was not lost this year - it never is. Parents educated their kids, juggled conflicting Zoom classroom schedules and found creative ways to do holidays when faced with restrictions. Some turned to homeschooling and actually liked it, as did a parent I met in a park recently, playing with her kids and unworried about school closures or COVID exposure. But not everyone can make that choice and as a result many kids are caught in the crosshairs of fear. Fear, little of it based in reason or science, has been the motivation for so much in 2021.What do we need in 2022? To move from fear to freedom. It is no longer the confusing days of March 2020. As the lethality of the virus (some studies suggest) may have begun to wane, the strength of old virtues - tenacity, determination, sacrifice - has grown. Individual Canadians are capable of deciding for themselves how to weigh risks to themselves. Let there be no further fear-mongering about shutting down places of worship, businesses, sports teams, shops, travel and so on. And let's not simply transfer our fears, either, to the fear of rising debt, interest rates, inflation, real estate. From fear to freedom, with a little bit of another f-word (no, not that one)... faith.
