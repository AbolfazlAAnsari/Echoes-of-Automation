Biden smeared Trump by referring to him as the nation’s first racist president.Half the nation will take some time to forget all that. The repair of warped protocols will take longer, given that the left forgot the ancient Thucydidean warning to us not to destroy the very institutions whose protections one day we may need.Biden should hope that a rogue FBI does not conduct freelance investigations of him the way it did regarding Trump. Let Biden pray there is not a partisan medical community to diagnose him as impaired and suited for 25th Amendment removal, as was the case with Trump.Biden should hope that if Republicans hold the Senate in January, they do not mimic the Democratic habit of voting against nearly every Trump nominee. If they were to do that as a majority party in both chambers of Congress, Biden would have trouble confirming even a single judge.So let us celebrate Biden’s call to unity.But Biden should hope that the opposition will not do to him and his party what the Democrats did so bitterly to Trump.
