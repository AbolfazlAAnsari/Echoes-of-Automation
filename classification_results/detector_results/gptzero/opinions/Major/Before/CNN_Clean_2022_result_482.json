Rick Scott of Florida, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, made a closing argument on Friday for what a Republican Congress would do about inflation. Hesaid: \"Step one, we've got to do in government what families do. You live within your means. On top of that, we've got to figure out how to produce energy in this country safely.\"Kevin McCarthy also outlined the GOP plan to fight inflation in his\"Commitment to America\"proposal. His plan includes curbing wasteful government spending, implementing pro-growth tax policies, and making America energy independent to reduce gas prices. McCarthy also outlined a plan to address safety by supporting law enforcement and securing the border to combat illegal immigration.Given the poll numbers we're seeing, I expect the GOP to regain both the House and Senate. Some Republican candidates are closing the gap on their opponents in key Senate races. I suspect this is due to the Republicans' focus on the issues that are top of mind for voters.In Georgia, Republican candidate Herschel Walker is in a dead heat with incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. Walker's closing ad addresses \"massive inflation\" and concerns about crime under the current administration. And in a statement to the Washington Examiner, hesaid, \"Raphael Warnock and Joe Biden have made the lives of Georgians worse than they were two years ago.\"In New Hampshire, Republican Senate candidate Dan Bolduc was smart to focus on the \"heating and eating\" issues that weigh on Granite State voters in the final debate against Sen. Maggie Hassan.It's often said that history repeats itself, and I see that this current election cycle is reminiscent of the 1990s. In their book, \"Storming the Gates: Protest Politics and the Republican Revival,\" Washington Post columnist Dan Balz and CNN Analyst Ron Brownstein wrote about the so called \"Republican Revolution\" that emerged in the 1994 midterm elections during Democratic President Bill Clinton's first term. The GOP won control of both chambers of Congressfor the first time in 40 years, picking up54 seatsin the House andeight seatsin the Senate.Balz and Brownstein discuss three broad trends that we still see today: \"economic stagnation, cultural fragmentation, and political alienation.\"Today we have inflation woes, crime waves, reproductive rights debates, border battles, and racial conflicts. Each issue is intertwined with anxiety for voters and elected officials.Then, as now, Republicans highlighted the \"government is the problem\" message to match the growing anti-Washington sentiment. People wanted change and looked to the GOP to provide that in 1994. I expect that to be the case in 2022.The GOP is poised to win back the House and Senate because they have listened to voters, heard their concerns, and offered solutions. Democrats have been tone deaf when it comes to the real issues impacting Americans, choosing to focus on threats to democracy over everyday concerns about the cost of groceries and gas. This election is about the basic need to feed families, rather than fanning fears of a fallen Democracy.Opinion by Alice StewartTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
