Shortly after the fall of Kabul I retired after serving 25 years in Navy special operations. But my fight wasn’t over.I still cannot answer the question of what it was all for. I lost so many friends there; friends with whom I will never grow old with and friends who will never see their children grow up. I am reminded of the harsh price of war as I drive by Arlington National Cemetery or when I walk past afellow wounded warrior at Walter Reed.I will never get back the years I lost with my own wife and children.But even after it all, I stand in pride of our service, having stood shoulder to shoulder with the nation’s most amazing men and women. I strive to keep my word to Nathan, the son of a fallen hero and a friend, to one day hold responsible the banks and people responsible for taking his father away from him. While many of our elected leaders have forgotten their oath of office, we, America’s veterans, are coming to Congress to restore America’s honor. We will keep the promises so many have exchanged for politicsHung Cao is a retired Navy captain who served in Special Operations for 25 years. He is a refugee from Vietnam and immigrant to the United States after his family escaped in 1975 shortly before the fall of Saigon.
