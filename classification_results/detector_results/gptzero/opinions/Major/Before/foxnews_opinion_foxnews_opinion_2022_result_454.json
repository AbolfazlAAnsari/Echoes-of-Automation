Philip Arthur. ‘The message of this passage to Christians, whether in the first or twenty-first century, then, is: ‘Be what you are!’\"Indeed, we need to realize what and who we are. Do we fully grasp that, as believers we actually havethe Holy Spirit of Jesus ChristHimself living inside of us? How different our prayers might look, and how much more powerful they’d be if we did. While Jesus physically walked on the earth, He preached, taught, miraculously healed the sick, cast demons out of people, and did so many other things beyond the scope of our comprehension (John 21:25).David Limbaugh and Christen Limbaugh Bloom, co-authors of \"The Resurrected Jesus.\"(Regnery)These signs and wonders were meant to increase, not decrease, whenJesus ascended back to Heaven,as He explained to His disciples when He told them of the Holy Spirit in John 16: \"At that time you won’t need to ask me for anything. I tell you the truth, you will ask the Father directly, and he will grant your request because you use my name. You haven’t done this before. Ask, using my name, and you will receive, and you will have abundant joy\" (v 23-24 NLT).Do we fully grasp that, as believers we actually have the Holy Spirit of Jesus Christ Himself living inside of us? How different our prayers might look, and how much more powerful they’d be if we did.Therefore, as individual members of the body of Christ with different spiritual gifts (Eph 4), the next time tragedy strikes in the lives of our loved ones or on a larger scale, let’s invite the Holy Spirit to guide us in ways only He can.Let’s approach the people facing tragedy andpray with themor get together with a group of fellow believers and pray together with bold faith for God to move in miraculous ways.Prayer is absolutely the most powerful response to a hurting world. We just need to believe it ourselves and act accordingly.\"I am the Lord;there is no other God.I have equipped you for battle,though you don’t even know me,so all the world from east to westwill know there is no other God\" (Isaiah 45:5-6 NLT).CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CHRISTEN LIMBAUGH BLOOMChristen Limbaugh Bloom is the co-author of \"The Resurrected Jesus\" and the creator of Haplous, a Christian blog and Bible study community.
