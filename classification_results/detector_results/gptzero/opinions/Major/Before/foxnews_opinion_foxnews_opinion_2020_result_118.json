He kept up American diplomatic engagement in Middle East peace efforts. And, of course, 1972 saw the historic overture to China that resulted in Nixon’s landmark meeting with Mao Zedong. The American people clearly found this impressive enough to return Nixon to office in the election that year.President Trump, too, has a strong record of serving the cause of peace – in some ways, even stronger than Nixon’s.Although it may come as surprise to his critics, who tend to find him bellicose, President Trump, too, has a strong record of serving the cause of peace – in some ways, even stronger than Nixon’s. Just this month, a U.S.-brokered deal was announced that would make the United Arab Emirates the third Arab nation, and the first Gulf state, to achieve full diplomatic relations with Israel. This historic achievement will do much for regional harmony and could pave the way, even tentatively, for greater cooperation between Israel and its neighbors.Elsewhere in the region, Trump has reduced the threat of the once-formidable ISIS terror group, cutting off their head with the death of their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and rolling back their so-called caliphate that once included wide swathes of Iraq and Syria. He did this, crucially, through a strategic campaign without another full-scale invasion. At the same time, the number of our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq have been reduced, with an American withdrawal from these decades-long wars increasingly looking, finally, like a reality.Another diplomatic success, which likely would have been heralded as a world-changing event had it occurred under Barack Obama, was Trump’s dramatic overtures to North Korea. Trump became not only the first U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader at his historic summit with Kim Jong-Un in Singapore in 2018, but later became the first to visit North Korea when he stepped over the line at the DMZ to shake Kim’s hand the following year. The relationship, like all diplomatic engagements, has had its ups and downs since then, but the critical nature of that first meeting cannot be undervalued.Joe Biden, as the nominee of the traditionally-dovish political party, seems to have an automatic claim to the mantle of “peacemaker.” But the reality is that Biden’s decades-long career in government has left him with a foreign policy record that has been questionable from the beginning. In 1975, as a young senator from Delaware during the end stages of the Vietnam War, he spoke out against the rescue and resettlement of South Vietnamese civilians facing communist persecution.Decades later, not only did Biden support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, his suggested solution to keep the peace in Iraq showed only marginally more concern for the people living there than he had expressed for the South Vietnamese. Biden proposed dividing Iraq into three semi-autonomous ethnic and religious enclaves, which would only have further cemented the divisions that fomented the sectarian strife plaguing that country.Robert Gates, who served as secretary of Defense under President George W. Bush and later with Biden in the Obama administration, had a long body of work from which to draw when he famously wrote in his 2014 memoir Duty that Biden had “been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.”Last year, as the prospect of a Biden nomination inched closer, Gates said “I stand by that statement” when asked about it by Margaret Brennan of CBS.Americans will no doubt have a great many issues to consider when they make their choice between Trump and Biden in November. But we should remember to follow Nixon’s advice to “look to the future.” In doing so, we must separate the signal from the noise and look for the candidate who truly has done more to advance the cause of peace.
