Thisstrategywas long overdue given the fact that the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people and was carried out by far-right extremists happened back in 1995.In that strategy, the administration promised to circulate a booklet detailing \"mobilization indicators\" to law enforcement officials around the country highlighting potential signs and signals of domestic terrorism. This kind of information can be quite useful to local law enforcement, since terrorists often tread a predicable path toward violence.The Biden administration said it would alsodisseminate intelligenceabout \"domestic terrorism iconography, symbology, and phraseology\" -- information that can be hard to come by, since it is often so tightly held by extremists.Finally, limiting access to assault rifles that are designed to kill multiple victims would, of course, also cut the number of mass shooting deaths in the United States.But given the current state of American politics, a limit on the sale of semi-automatic weapons is unlikely, even though it might have helped prevent the sale of such deadly firearms to perpetrators like thealleged shooterin the racist assault in Buffalo.This story has been updated to reflect the latest news.TM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
