In fact, this story has an absolutely shocking conclusion, and it’s also one of the reasons Iknowthere is a higher power. Let me explain.In the early 90’s Father Jerome Fasano baptized two of our children at St. Catherine of SiennaCatholic Churchin our Virginia neighborhood outside Washington, DC.I attended with great regularity, andFather Fasanobecame a very good friend and loved Kathy’s lasagna, which she famously made me on our first date and we have forever since referred to as \"Engagement Lasagna.\"STEVE DOOCY: THIS RITZ CRACKER PEANUT BUTTER PIE IS SO GOOD, YOU'LL WONDER HOW TO EAT IT EVERY DAYOnce the Father invited me to attend a meeting in the rectory to hear the eyewitness account of Ivan Dragicevic, one of six young people who in the 1980s claimed to have seen the Virgin Mary in Medjugorje, Bosnia.Of course, I said I’d go, because I love to hear personal recollections of historical events, plus there was always cake at evening events at the rectory.When I arrived, there were about 20 people in a circle made of folding chairs, and in the back of the living room was Father Fasano with the actual visionary and his translator.I got the last chair by the door and sat down. As soon as I did, Father Fasano said that before we heard the speaker’s story, we would pray the Rosary, which I knew... kind of.At that time I’d probably heard the Rosary once in my life; I remember it was the Our Father and Hail Mary over and over, and then some other prayers, which we read out of a book. While I was waiting for somebody to hand out the cheat sheets, everyone in the room started praying out loud in unison.Somebody handed me a rosary and I immediately put my finger on the first bead, everybody else was holding the crucifix, so I backed up one.As long as everybody prayed out loud, in unison, I’d be fine.
