            "inputText": "By Jay S. Kaufman and Joanna MerckxWe are both epidemiologists, and one of us specializes in pediatric infectious diseases. Confined at home with our small children running amok, we are acutely aware of the impact on families of the lockdown to \"flatten the curve\" of the current pandemic. The characteristics and transmission dynamics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes the disease known as COVID-19) still remain largely unknown. But as new epidemiologic information does become available, it is important to reassess the complex social policies that were enacted to save lives, protect our health-care system and at the same time minimize collateral damage to families and civil society.Over 90 per cent of students worldwide(https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse) have now been affected by pandemic-related school closures. A few countries are now cautiously reopening schools and others plan to do so in coming weeks. Ontario, meanwhile, has recently extended its closure, as have many U.S. states. As parents struggle to supervise and educate children at home and teachers are concerned for their workplace safety, we need to consider the important possibility that children may in fact play a limited role in passing the virus to others. Given their gregarious and unhygienic habits, children are often assumed to be important conduits of infectious disease. This is clearly true for influenza, which helps explain the common presumption that children ought to be important drivers of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well. In fact, there is little evidence this is so and plenty of reason to doubt it.It is well established that children can acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection(https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2003717) but that the disease tends to be mild or even completely unnoticed(https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/apa.15270). Children younger than 10 account for one per cent of confirmed cases(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130) and generally do not require hospitalization or intensive care(https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6914e4.htm) unless compromised by pre-existing illness(https://dontforgetthebubbles.com/evidence-summary-paediatric-covid-19-literature/ ). As we await age-specific data on past infection from seroserology, preliminary evidence from China suggests children are less likely(https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa450/5821281) to become infected than adults, while surveillance data from Iceland(https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2006100) also show low infection rates in young children. More importantly, initial data suggest that children are not very good transmitters of the virus.In detailed contact tracing from China, Korea and other countries, epidemiologists have encountered remarkably few instances(https://www.fhi.no/globalassets/dokumenterfiler/rapporter/2020/the-role-of-children-in-the-transmission-of-sars-cov-2-report-2020.pdf) in which children formed part of a transmission chain. This observation is not implausible when considering analogies to other infectious diseases that are better understood. Tuberculosis, for example, is a serious bacterial disease also spread through airborne particles from one person to another, and killing more than a million people every year. But though children can become infected and suffer from tuberculosis they generally do not transmit it to others.(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2795276/#__sec1title)In the case of SARS-CoV-2, a review of household transmission clusters(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044826v1) found that a possible pediatric initial case was present in less than 10 per cent of investigated household clusters. This is in stark contrast to other epidemics, such as avian influenza, for which a child was the source of household infection more than half the time. Households are an especially good setting to study how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted because the contact between child and adult members is as close as it can get. Finding a very limited role for children in fuelling the transmission chain within the family suggests that school closures are probably not adding much in the containment of the epidemic. A literature review by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health found only one example(https://www.fhi.no/en/publ/2020/The-role-of-children-in-the-transmission-of-covid-19/) for SARS-CoV-2 where a small child might have infected his parents.Staff disinfect a classroom before high school students return following the outbreak of COVID-19, at a school in Beijing, China, on April 21, 2020.A number of mathematical models(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031849v1) of the COVID-19 epidemic also support the conjecture that transmission of the virus from children is rare or absent. In places where schools remained open, such as Hong Kong(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3558015) and Iceland, there is no evidence they were important places of transmission. One detailed investigation of an infected nine-year-old boy(https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa424/5819060) in France did not detect a single secondary case after he had contact with 112 peers and adults at three different schools during his symptomatic period. The currently available literature(https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30095-X/fulltext), though still quite limited, therefore supports the theory that children pass on the infection rarely if at all.If it is true that children do not contribute importantly to the propagation of the epidemic, it's likely that school closures have a minimal impact on controlling the virus. But they do clearly have profound effects on the workforce(https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30082-7/fulltext) and on the health of children and parents. Among other things, they exacerbate child obesity(https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.22813), household violence(https://unsdg.un.org/resources/policy-brief-impact-covid-19-children) and intellectual setbacks for children missing out on educational content(https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-626-x/11-626-x2020001-eng.htm). Children with special needs are most severely affected. They are cut off from professional management and institutional resources, while school closure for children living in poor or marginalized households exacerbates existing inequalities(https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30084-0/fulltext).We must stress that when we refer to children we mean those of elementary-school age and younger. Though teens and adolescents have their own specific vulnerabilities and struggles with the limitations imposed by lockdowns, there is evidence that their role in transmission parallels that of adults(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20032136v1). For children in high school and university, going back to school will be therefore be more complicated, potentially requiring greater use of physical distancing, hand hygiene and masks. The same holds true for inevitable social and professional interactions between parents and other adults in all school environments. If schools are open, teachers will commute to work and interact with each other, requiring additional hygiene and distancing measures to ensure their health and safety.SARS-CoV-2 has only circulated in human populations for a few months and much remains to be learned about its transmission and prevention. But already there is substantial reason to suspect that young children are not major contributors to the COVID-19 epidemic and may not need to be kept from school any longer. If we can allow a safe and carefully managed return, this would be a great relief to both children and parents.Jay Kaufman is a professor of epidemiology, biostatistics and occupational health at McGill University and an editor of the journal \"Epidemiology.\" Joanna Merckx, MD, is a pediatric infectious disease specialist teaching infectious disease epidemiology at McGill University and director, medical affairs, at bioMÃ©rieux Canada Inc.
