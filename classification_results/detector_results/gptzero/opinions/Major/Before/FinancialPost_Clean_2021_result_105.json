The model is outdated and rigid.In terms of costs, why should provinces move from daycare costs of more than $1,000 a month to $10 a day? What if some provinces want to charge more than $10 a day so that they can afford to fund more spaces?Why is it good public policy to provide cheap daycare to wealthy Canadians? What if some provinces want to base fee levels on income, so that upper-income people pay more, and the money is used to expand the supply of daycare? Gearing costs to income and providing more supply to others is arguably fairer than the proposed Quebec-based model. Provinces need the flexibility to decide the parental payment structure and level that works best for their jurisdictions.Flexibility also means subsidizing many kinds of daycares to meet the needs of today's diverse workforce. The budget commits \"support primarily for the not-for-profit sector,\" which would leave out private operators, often small female-owned businesses, that provide daycare to today's workforce, which includes many shift workers, more part-time and temporary workers, and people whose daycare needs vary from week to week.As two female private daycare operators wrote in the Globe and Mail(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-10-a-day-child-care-needs-to-serve-all-working-parents/): \"Failing to enable diverse care models means only middle-class, full-time, permanently employed parents will benefit from a $10/day model.\" Surely, we do not want to create a two-tiered system where an \"elite\" group of parents are fortunate enough to access not-for-profit, $10-a-day daycare, while leaving many others to pay much more for less traditional but equally essential daycare services.What is required is compromise and accommodation, especially since provinces are understandably skeptical about the prospect of another federal-provincial cost-sharing program. When medicare was created, the federal government used 50/50 cost sharing to pressure provinces to support the program. Today, even if federal personal tax point transfers are included, provinces pick up two-thirds of medicare costs (without tax points, the federal share is only 21 per cent).The same budget that introduced the new federal-provincial daycare plan ignored provincial appeals to make a long-term increase in federal transfers for provincial health-care systems that are overburdened with COVID-19 patients and long-term care facilities, which have been devastated during the pandemic.It would have been simpler and more expedient for the federal government to directly fund daycare costs through grants or tax credits. Probably, to keep the program targeted, a focus on affordability for parents needing to work would have enabled the federal government to save some money for other health-related provincial transfers.National PostJanice MacKinnon is a former Saskatchewan minister of social services and Jack Mintz is the president's fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy.Danielle Kubes: Universal daycare bad for women, children and the economy(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/danielle-kubes-universal-daycare-bad-for-women-children-and-the-economy)Jack M.
