It is based on a minimum of 35 hours per week. (In reality, most carers invest considerably more hours than that, both day and night.)The 2020-21 carers allowance is £67.25 per week. This works out at £1.92 per hour. If you work, you can't earn more than £128 per week and the icing on the cake is that when you receive your state pension your carers allowance stops.Statistically, there is a growing trend for carers to continue their role in their old age.Come on Sunak and Johnson, please consider the amount we save the UK in residential care fees compared to the plight myself and other carers find themselves in.Juliet N F Gregory                                          Address suppliedWildlife appealEvgeny Lebedev's reporton the increase in wildlife slaughter during the pandemic, and the loss of income for wildlife protection agencies during the same period, was heartbreaking. Those of us who are absolutely devastated by the ongoing carnage inflicted on the natural world look on in horror and disbelief at the lack of world action to crack down hard on the markets for animal parts that drive this dreadful slaughter, which is literally destroying our planet's ecosystem, as well as causing unspeakable agony for millions of animals.A suggestion for one source of funding for protecting wildlife: our own fantastically wealthy royal family could make some amends for their past enthusiastic killing of animals such as tigers and elephants by donating chunks of their riches. I include a young \"royal\" couple in America who live in utter luxury, who could also donate some of their wealth, instead of constantly preaching to the rest of us while costing a fortune to be supported in the style to which they are accustomed.A more realistic hope, if I may, is to ask The Independent to dedicate its Christmas fundraising appeal to help victims of the cruel wildlife trade, such as the poor bears trapped in pain, filth and misery in Asia's bear bile hellholes, and also the dedicated agencies in the field who risk their own lives, in the face of global indifference, to try and protect the animals.Penny Little                                          Great Haseley, OxfordshireUnpleasantly divisiveCatherine Lux's articlewas the laziest piece of journalism I've had the misfortune to read in a long time. She took a few buzz words (eg. boomers, snowflakes, generation Z) and shoehorned a couple of behaviours into each category to suit her argument. The thoughtful approach is the opposite: what behaviours can I observe and which social cohorts - if, indeed, any - strongly display those behaviours? Rarely, if ever, is there such a broad generational sweep as she attempted to present. In fact, I found her article not just misguided but unpleasantly divisive.Beryl Wall                                          London"
