Sure, he has spearheaded racist policies such asstop-and-frisk, but he has also spent lots of money tackling gun violence andthe climatecrisis. And, unlike the reality TV star ruining the country, Bloomberg has political experience. Indeed, as a former mayor of New York City (population 8.5 million), he is far more qualified for the job than Buttigieg, the ex-mayor of South Bend, Indiana (population 102,000).Whether Bloomberg is a \"better\" billionaire than Trump is not the point. Democracy is broken if someone can parachute into an election at the last minute and spend unlimited amounts - there arenorestrictions on self-financing- transforming themselves into a viable candidate. Democracy is broken when a billionaire can, as Bernie Sanders put it, attempt to\"buy this election\".Some may argue that buying a ton of ads is not the same as buying an election, particularly as the outsized influence of money in US politics is nothing new. According toa 2014 studyby two political scientists, \"economic elites and organised groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on US government policy\", while average people \"have little or no independent influence\". Is there much difference between a billionaire self-funding and a candidate raising money from billionaires?Yes. I don't think you can underestimate the optics of Bloomberg's unapologetic spending spree. It lifts the veil on money in politics. It sends a dispiriting message to an already disillusioned electorate that politics is a swamp where ordinary people are not represented and where influence is bought. Even if Bloomberg doesn't win the nomination, it seems inevitable that his success so far will pave the way for more billionaires. Bezos 2024? Zuckerberg 2028? It looks increasingly likely.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist"
