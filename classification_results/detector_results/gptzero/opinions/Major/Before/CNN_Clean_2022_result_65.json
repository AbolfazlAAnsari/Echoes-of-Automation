The insanely wealthy pay the best lawyers and accountants, who employ tools such asborrowing,shell companies, complex trusts and more to shield the rich from tax liability.The real-world impact is that you and I are left tofundour nation's schools, military, police, environmental policies, etc. -- all the stuff these wealthy people use but are paying as little taxes as possible to support.Polls showAmericans overwhelmingly are bothered \"a lot\" by the wealthy not paying what we view as their \"fair share\" of taxes.There are proposals to fix this injustice. Last monthPresident Joe Biden proposedthat those worth more than $100 million pay a federal income tax rate of at least 20% on their income, including unrealized gains on assets that are not currently taxed.Sen. Elizabeth Warrenof Massachusetts and other Democrats last year introduced a \"wealth tax\" on the ultra-rich that included a 3% tax on billionaires. Overall, about 100,000 American families would be subject to the tax that, according to an analysis provided to lawmakers, would raise $3 trillion over a decade.People favor the idea that Musk and other uber-rich should pay their fair share of taxes every year -- not just when one of them exercises stock options.I would bet, however, that people such as Musk would prefer pitting left vs. right so that we argue over whether he should own Twitter. Instead, we should be joining forces to demand that elected officials end the loopholes and ensure the wealthy pay their fair share.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
