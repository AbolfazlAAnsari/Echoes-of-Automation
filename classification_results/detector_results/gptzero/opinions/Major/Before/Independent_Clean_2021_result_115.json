Pity he didn't stick by his words. This does need to be investigated and Labour is right to pursue this robustly with determination to get to the bottom of this invidious affair.Judith A DanielsGreat Yarmouth, Norfolk'No rules broken'If I were a betting man, or woman, I'd be willing to put a few bob on the outcome of the government's investigation into the Greensill affair. It will probably be found that no action need be taken against any ministers or officials, former or current, because \"no rules were broken\".But should it not be a requirement of those in high office that they do what is right, and are seen to be doing that? If they merely abide by inadequate rules they reveal themselves to be grubby little people feathering their own grubby little nests. And their successors in authority, if they fail to censure them, risk being tarred with the same brush.Susan AlexanderFrampton Cotterell, GloucestershireLockdown easing dangerBoris Johnsontells us that easinglockdownwill inevitably create a rise incoronavirusdeaths. He has, meanwhile, eased lockdown. Therefore I hold him personally responsible for the forthcoming rise in coronavirus deaths.But a quick ruffle of that unkempt hair and a rueful smile, while sporting an engagingly ill-fitting suit, should sort it. That is the despicable level of our politics. Any half-decent Tory and all other MPs who do not rage against this most unprincipled of governments are complicit.Beryl WallLondonSlowly does itIn February last year I finally retired at the age of 72, bought a new car and tentatively planned to visit friends and family in various parts of the British Isles and around the world. I got as far as Slough before the restrictions came into force.My partner and I absolutely followed the sound advice of isolating at home, only to shop when necessary, and washing/sanitising hands on returning home. We have both had our jabs and will venture out in the near future.We were cocooned in a three-bedroom house with a small garden. From the outset I believed that we would have a \"rocky ride\" but, believe it or not, it has been enjoyable.We have discussed events and feelings, laughed, and argued, but crucially have become closer as a result.The dreadful consequences of the pandemic were always in the back of our minds but we stayed positive and we count ourselves lucky to have missed the trauma that so many people have experienced.We both yearn to be free to roam as we did before this crisis but realise that it will be a long haul before we are free of Covid-19. Bored we are not, just a little fatigued by monotony. Most of all we miss interaction with people, friends and family.Perhaps next year we can get back to a less surreal way of life. Perhaps we can get gossip firsthand, actually cheer at a sporting arena, cry, laugh and feel proud at leaving-dos, weddings and funerals, etc. It will soon come.As in any story there is a start, a middle and now we need the crescendo, an end to the heartbreak that so many have experienced. For now let's go slowly and not forego the gains we have achieved.Keith PooleBasingstokeHorse triumphI heard about the wonderful achievement of a woman being the first to win a major horse race. Surely the clue is in the name \"horse race\" - it was a horse that won the race who just happened to have a female clinging on to its back.Geoff ForwardStirlingRead MoreModerna vaccine given to patients in UKPeople were right to complain about the BBC's enforced grievingBBC's coverage of Prince Philip's death misjudged the public mood"
