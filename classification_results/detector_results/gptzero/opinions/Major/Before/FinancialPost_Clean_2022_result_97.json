Just 15 years ago, Alberta had no provincial debt(https://financialpost.com/category/personal-finance/debt/), no sales tax and the lowest income tax(https://financialpost.com/tag/income-taxes/) rates in the country. But times have changed. For many Albertans paying income tax, their province no longer has the lowest income tax rates in the country. It has also racked up tens of billions of dollars of government debt. Thankfully, Albertans still do enjoy the advantage of living in the only province without a sales tax - for now.Canada's Atlantic provinces, on the other hand, are some of the most difficult places to live for taxpayers. All four have a 15 per cent sales tax - the highest in the nation - as well as some of the country's highest income tax rates.But since coming to office in 2018, Blaine Higgs' Conservatives have been steadily charting a new course for New Brunswick, which is starting to separate itself from the Atlantic pack, with a lower tax burden, consecutive balanced budgets and falling provincial debt.Last week, Higgs announced sweeping new income tax cuts that will lower the tax burden for the vast majority of New Brunswickers. They represent the most significant income tax cuts in a generation. For a taxpayer earning(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/province-cutting-income-propety-taxes-1.6637111) $75,000 a year, the cuts will deliver $214 in tax relief per year and more than $1,000 over a five-year period. That may not sound like much but what other government is giving taxpayers their money back?Consider neighbouring Nova Scotia. With the new tax cuts in place, a New Brunswicker making $75,000 a year should expect to pay $8,606 in provincial income tax. A Nova Scotian earning the same amount would pay $664 more. And thanks to Nova Scotia's regressive \"bracket creep\" policies, that $664 gap will keep growing year after year. Bracket creep occurs when inflation(https://financialpost.com/tag/inflation/) pushes taxpayers into higher income tax brackets because the government hasn't index the brackets to inflation.New Brunswick does index its income tax brackets. So do the federal government and eight provinces. Only Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island do not. That means the emerging New Brunswick Advantage will only grow in years to come.Terence Corcoran: Doug Ford wins one for the Charter of Rights(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-doug-ford-wins-one-for-the-charter-of-rights)Opinion: CUPE strikes underscore need for school choice in Ontario(https://financialpost.com/opinion/cupe-strike-school-choice-ontario-education)William Watson: Chrystia Freeland blows her fiscal windfall on wine and cheese(https://financialpost.com/opinion/william-watson-chrystia-freeland-fiscal-windfall)New Brunswick is also leading the way on debt reduction. It was the only province to balance its books every year during the pandemic. And its debt is going down, not up. Some provinces have fake balanced budgets: their operating spending is covered by tax revenues but they still borrow to pay for finance infrastructure projects. New Brunswick's revenues cover both its operating and capital spending. And in the past year alone, the government reduced(https://www2.gnb.ca/content/dam/gnb/Departments/tb-ct/pdf/OC/public-accounts-vol-1-2022.pdf) the province's debt by nearly $1 billion.The fiscal job that is well underway is far from finished, however. Because many of Premier Higgs' predecessors racked up bills on the taxpayer credit card, New Brunswickers still owe more per capita(https://www.debtclock.ca/provincial-debtclocks/new-brunswick/) in government debt than their neighbours in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Lowering that debt burden and the hundreds of millions of dollars of debt interest that comes with it will require more fiscal work.Still, New Brunswick is clearly moving in the right direction and is emerging as one of the most fiscally responsible provinces in the nation. It has had genuinely balanced budgets for several years, including during the pandemic. Its income tax burden is now the lowest in the region and even beats out provinces like Manitoba and Quebec. And its debt reduction is real. Its surpluses are real surpluses, unlike those of most other provinces that claim to have balanced their books.The fiscal work is far from finished but what has been done so far is ushering in a new era of a New Brunswick Advantage.Jay Goldberg is interim Atlantic director at the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
