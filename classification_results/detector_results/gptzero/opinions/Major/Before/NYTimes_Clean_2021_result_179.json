This line of argument defines the meaning of economic interest too narrowly.Affluent voters who support more social services often do so because they understand that inequality and poverty are bad for everyone. Unequal societies have been shown to have more anxiety, less economic growth and greater political instability. It is thus in everyone’s economic and political interest to have more egalitarian societies. Some rich people will have fewer excess goods, but that’s a small price to pay for a decent and stable world.The real issue is that the shared interests of the affluent few and the less affluent many are perpetually blocked by a political and economic elite who continue to pit us against one another. Until this elite is either rejected by a nonviolent social movement or manages to recognize that they, too, will be better off in a more equal world, we will continue on the path of our fractured politics.Avram AlpertPrinceton, N.J.PHOTO:    (PHOTOGRAPH BY Matthew Monteith for The New York Times FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
