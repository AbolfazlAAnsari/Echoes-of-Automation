The economic effects would be catastrophic; the measures could be enacted only with \"half-totalitarian\" policies; the cost for children, for women, and for the arts would be enormous. On the other side of the debate, given the high economic, social and psychological costs of lockdown measures, an increasing number of commentators are beginning to claim that we must \"learn to live\" with the pandemic. \"Returning to normal,\" wrote Jakob Augstein, publisher of the left-leaning weekly Der Freitag last week, \"means returning to the virus.\"But both of these calls for radically different approaches to the pandemic feel half-hearted. We've all seen the problems that come with a harder lockdown by now, while the example of Sweden has shown that relying on voluntary measures alone will likely lead to an alarming increase in the mortality rate. With the most recent reports showing a slight but steady improvement in the infection rate, discussions about loosening Germany's hard lockdown are certain to intensify - as is exhaustion with the continued efforts to slow the spread of the disease.All in all, however, most Germans seem to feel that Merkel's government has responded to the pandemic passably well. Distressingly enough, it turns out that 50,000 Covid dead might indeed be the picture of a successful response to the pandemic in a major European country.Peter Kuras is a writer and translator based in Berlin"
