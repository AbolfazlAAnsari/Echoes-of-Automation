Also: Responses to Senator Josh Hawley; boosters; UC Hastings.To the Editor:Re “A Farewell to Readers, With Hope,” by Nicholas Kristof (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 31):Considering that my level of cynicism on the human race is rising by the day, this farewell essay by Mr. Kristof could not have come at a better time. I have long enjoyed reading his columns, but this one encapsulated stories about the best among us amid the worst among us. That he could remain optimistic considering all the evil that he has personally witnessed has renewed my faith in the possibilities of the good triumphing over the evil.If he is successful at becoming governor of Oregon, its citizens will have received a gift no amount of money can buy. Goodbye, Nicholas, and wishing you the best of luck. I can’t think of anyone who deserves it more.Linda DrumBradenton, Fla.To the Editor:I remember the first time I met Nick Kristof my freshman year at Harvard. He was wearing a T-shirt that said, “Where the Hell Is Yamhill, Oregon?” Nick is clearly someone who is proud of his roots and is proof that you can go home again.While Nick has won two Pulitzer Prizes writing for The Times and has helped inform the world about some of the biggest humanitarian crises around the world, many of his columns about returning home to Yamhill have resonated with me the most.He has written about his high school classmates and friends who have died from addiction, have been in prison and are unemployed. This is not a crisis in Sudan or some other far-flung place that Nick reported from. It’s what is happening all across this country.Nick is running for governor of Oregon because he wants to help all the people in Yamhill and throughout Oregon. While I’ll miss reading his columns, I’m grateful that he has heeded the call for public service.Rachel Gelin BreininRye, N.Y.To the Editor:Nicholas Kristof leaves us with yet another moving essay. Mr. Kristof, you are one of a kind, a gift to humanity and a magnifying glass to the world. You have taken us to places that many of us would never see, and you have educated us about human beings around the world.So, thank you immensely, Mr. Kristof. We will miss you, but I am sure you will continue your life’s work, fighting on behalf of people who deserve to be heard and have a better life. The citizens of Oregon will surely gain a giant of humanity if you are elected as their governor!Michael HadjiargyrouCenterport, N.Y.To the Editor:Nick Kristof is an international treasure and the definition of what journalism can be at its very best.I grew up in a newspaper family. My mother,Norma Hendricks,was a columnist for The Leesburg Daily Commercial, and the clack of her ancient Underwood typewriter was the soundtrack of my childhood.With that background, I was not prepared for the emotional impact Nick’s farewell had. My wife and I both burst into tears reading his beautiful message. We’ll miss him so much. At the same time, running for governor of Oregon seems like an ideal thing to do with his passions.Thanks to The Times for giving Nick the space to contribute his particular genius to the world. Best wishes to Nick in his new venture.Gay HendricksOjai, Calif.To the Editor:Mr. Kristof: I have loved your columns over these many years — your thoughtfulness, your training new journalists by taking them with you where you travel, your courage to cover experiences that are deeply painful so that we can expand our awareness and do something, and your holiday donation recommendations.You will be sorely missed.Eve EdenSanta Cruz, Calif.Senator Hawley’s Supply Chain SolutionTo the Editor:Re “To Solve Our Supply Chain Crisis, Rethink Trade,” by Josh Hawley (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 30):While needlessly peppering blame for the nation’s supply chain crisis on President Biden, who has been in office for a scant nine months, Senator Hawley correctly notes that America must redevelop its industrial base if we are to secure our access to critical goods and begin to narrow the gaping hole of income inequality.What he fails to note is that the “stability in our markets” he plans to instill through his legislation will stabilize the cost of consumer goods at a notably higher level. America’s higher worker wages compared with low-wage nations will increase the cost of goods sold. Likewise, rebuilding factories to achieve Mr. Hawley’s goals will increase costs.Just as past politicians failed to note that market globalization would drain America of its well-paid factory jobs, so has Mr. Hawley failed to admit that his plan will reduce America’s access to underpriced goods. Walmart would cease to be the Walmart we know without low-cost, overseas production.I, for one, believe that buying less, but buying American, is a good thing. Will Americans who already struggle to afford what they need agree?Rosemary KuropatWainscott, N.Y.The writer has worked in public sector economic development and private sector strategic business development.To the Editor:You published an essay on trade by Senator Josh Hawley despitehis important rolepushing for the nullification of a free and fair presidential election. He sought nothing less than authoritarianism in the United States.Injustifying publication of this essay,Patrick Healy, deputy Opinion editor, makes no mention of Mr. Hawley’s anti-democratic role.Jeremy PressmanWest Hartford, Conn.To the Editor:While I am not always a fan of Senator Josh Hawley, I think he is right to point to the need to reinvigorate American manufacturing, especially those industries that are essential to our national security and health, such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and solar energy.I would be more than willing to pay more for goods made in America.Mark SpundOceanside, N.Y.My Booster Shot: Tears of Joy and MourningTo the Editor:In early January I scored a drive-through Moderna vaccine appointment for my 83-year-old mother. We left an hour early, then sat in a tense motorcade line for another hour. When the validations were complete and the kind nurse finally injected her, I broke down, sobbing. The relief was so intense.At my own first injection months later, I found myself trapped in a crowded health care facility hallway, waiting. I cried tears of frustration and anxiety. And now, at the amazingly efficient and friendly Kmart clinic for my booster, the journey rounds what feels like the turn for home.I am intensely grateful to all who brought us to this hopeful moment. The Covid monster isn’t gone or even tamed, but my defenses are strong and I am no longer afraid. We will over time painfully learn what this pandemic has cost us. It is far greater than what the Covid dashboards show. The collective loss and grief are immeasurable.In the Kmart clinic “recovery zone,” I weep tears of joy and relief, filled with mourning.Christine LarsenMontclair, N.J.A Law School Founder’s CrimesTo the Editor:“School Faces Founder’s Role in Native Killings” (front page, Oct. 28) shines a light on a dark and disturbing chapter of California history — one linked inescapably to the law school I lead.Serranus Hastings, founder of the University of California Hastings College of the Law, perpetrated genocidal acts against Native Californians in the 1850s. The history of his crimes, and its lasting legacy, are subjects worthy of examination.One of my first acts as chancellor and dean in 2017 was to commission a study of Serranus Hastings’s deadly campaigns against Native Californians and to create a committee to recommend restorative justice initiatives. Since then, we have collaborated extensively with members of the pertinent tribes, including the Yuki.I am not leading a “campaign to keep the school’s name.” Although my initial recommendation to the Hastings board of directors was to focus on restorative justice initiatives with the affected tribes, and not a name change, I always understood that this issue was part of the robust process I initiated. In that process, all options for restorative justice are on the table, including the name.David L. FaigmanSan FranciscoPHOTO:   (PHOTOGRAPH BY David Smoler FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
