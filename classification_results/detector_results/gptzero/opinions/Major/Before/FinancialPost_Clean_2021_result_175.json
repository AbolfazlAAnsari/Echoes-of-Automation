This projection doesn't include any new spending the major parties are proposing during the campaign, which likely means even more debt. As Canadians weigh their electoral decisions, they should seriously consider the issue of debt and deficits.The deterioration of the federal government's long-term finances in recent years has been rapid and considerable.

In a recent analysis(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/interest-cost-risks-to-government-budgets) co-written with our colleague Milagros Palacios, we calculated that federal interest payments would increase by 59.4 per cent ($13.1 billion) if interest costs returned to their 2019-20 levels, which were near historic lows.Given the rise in inflation and the comparative increase in the riskiness of Canadian debt - as a proportion of GDP we have the fifth-highest(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/caution-required-when-comparing-canadas-debt-to-that-of-other-countries) total government debt among 29 industrialized countries - it's not hard to imagine nominal interest costs increasing in the near term. A rise in these costs would further erode federal finances and increase the deficit, expected to reach $154.7 billion this year and nearly $60.0 billion next year, again before factoring in campaign-related spending promises.It's also important to understand the nature of the debt Ottawa is accumulating. There are times when debt finance is appropriate. When a government builds an asset such as a bridge or highway that will be used over time, it's entirely appropriate to spread the cost over the asset's life, so the people using it actually pay for it.It's also appropriate for governments to borrow during recessions as tax revenues decline and spending rises, particularly on programs such as employment insurance (EI) that are sensitive to the state of the economy.
