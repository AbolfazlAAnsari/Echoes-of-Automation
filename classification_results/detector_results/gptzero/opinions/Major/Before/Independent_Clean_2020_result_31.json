This will enable us to have the comfort of punching at our weight, without the imposition of an illusion that we are punching, or can punch, above it. We will now receive absolutely clear, demonstrative evidence of exactly what Brexit means for the United Kingdom. All we have to do to see the truth is to be patient, clear-sighted and observe.I have no doubt that Nigel Farage, Iain Duncan Smith, Mark Francois, and all who deride the EU as the source of all our problems, will first find reasons, then excuses and then just incoherent rage to explain why it isn't working, but it will be too late. They will be exposed as the irrational, impractical, unintelligent, backward-looking, foam-flecked charlatans that they will be proved to have been all along. Peck is right when he writes that the two sides will not become reconciled; we will not \"come back together\". If you think Brexiteers are angry now, wait until you see how they behave when the sunny uplands of a newly triumphant economic powerhouse fail to materialise, then everything really will be Europe's fault.At the same time, it will be an amusing sideshow to watchBoris Johnsonand the Tories attempt to be both the Conservative and Unionist Party and the Pretend Labour Party, as they attempt to keep both their old and their new voters onside. If a party, which has been in power for 10 years, cannot plan ahead sufficiently to ensure that Big Ben is available to chime on the night which represents the pinnacle of their achievement, then I give little for their chances of significant success in other, more important, areas.Boris is Boris, he will do what he knows, which is to wing it. It'll be riveting as a spectacle but will not work as a political, commercial or international strategy. Tory factional infighting will commence in the spring and will make the ERG (remember them?) look like newborn lambs gambolling in the spring fields of their new lives. Politically, things will get much, much worse before they get better. Still, I look forward to watching the Tories in their terminal decline. After the coming failure and the inevitable extinguishing of their demographic base, these are the twilight times for them.The other cause for celebration, as part of the natural way the world works, is that over the next few years a lot of older people (and I write as one) will die and younger, more open, more imaginative people will take the lead. They will be unburdened by the memory of empires, kings and queens, wars, nationalism, shallow patriotism and the old, broken ways and so be free to help us evolve into societies where we all make better choices about how to co-exist on our small planet, preserving it as a blue and green beacon in the dark immensity of space.All things pass... and so will Brexit.Nick Kell                                          Address suppliedBrexit tensionsI found the sight of jubilant Brexiteers celebrating the UK's departure from theEuropean Unionon Friday night very reminiscent of Neville Chamberlain's return from the Munich Agreement in 1938.To the cheering crowds he declared that he had a piece of paper in his hand that promised \"peace for our time\", that all would be well, heed not the prophets of doom. Less than one year later, we were at war.Ron Dawson                                          DorsetA US-based niece tells me that Americans are holding Brexit parties, which they think are very funny. There is nothing quite like \"new best friends\" who mock you.John Scott Moncrieff                                          EdinburghTrade deal optimismI think you are being unduly pessimistic about the possibility of rapidly concluding trade negotiations. It is always possible to reach an early agreement in any negotiation, just agree with all the other side's proposals.David Wallis                                          CirencesterDivine interventionIf the US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, believes thatGod put Donald Trump into the White Houseand \"puts people in certain places in certain times, for such a time as this [...] at all times\", he could possibly think that the world's worst atrocities were ordained by God too. If true, I wonder how he would square such a statement with those horrors?Patrick Cleary                                          GloucestershireA new dawn for BritainAs the coronavirus, bushfires in Australia, the Arab-Israeli conflict and global terrorism have demonstrated, we live in a world plagued with interminable conflicts, wars, quarrels, environmental hazards and diseases that are able to transcend national borders and cause death, distrust and mayhem.Britain cannot live as an isolated, narrow-minded and inward-looking nation. Her relationship with Europe was one of courage, creativity, innovation and talent. They fought together to keep alive the flames of liberty and freedom. Let us hope that tomorrow will herald a new dawn of friendship and cooperation, not that of isolationism and protectionism.Munjed Farid Al Qutob                                          London NW2"
