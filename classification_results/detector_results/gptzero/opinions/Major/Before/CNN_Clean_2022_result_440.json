To advocate for her own health, \"I became who I never wanted to be: a confrontational, complaining Black woman,\"she writes.\"[M]y new life, which includes days of pain, brain fog, exhaustion and persistent eye issues, has left me unable to teach the students I cherished. I laugh at the money playing peekaboo in my bank account after exhausting all my leave benefits. And, some days, crying is all I can do.\"CNN Opinion asked health care and policy experts about their proposed solutions to refine our health care system so that it best serves all Americans.Theresa Brown: As nurses fare, so fare patientsWhen too few nurses work on a hospital floor, patients die who would likely otherwise have survived. That is not hyperbole, but a factwell established by research.Despite this, many hospitals have beenunderstaffing their wardsfor years. Then,Covid-19 came, confronting overworked nurses with extremely ill patients who were dangerously contagious. Many patients died, and many nurses quit. Of those who remain on the job,many are considering leaving.The crisis in nurse staffing arose largely because many health care entities prioritizeprofits over healing.Nurses comprise thebiggest labor poolof any hospital, and are therefore viewed in corporate terms as a cost center rather than a profit generator. Eliminating nursing positions gives hospitals an easy way to cut their labor costs. The problem is that that no nurse can do the job of two nurses well, so care managed within such a rigid capitalist framework will inevitably be less safe.To save nursing, and patient care, we need federally mandated staffing ratios of nurses to patients in the hospital. Ratios wereimplemented in Californiain 2004 without putting big hospital systems out of business. And the Center for Medicare and Medicaid recentlyimposed nurse staffing requirements in skilled nursing facilities, which are specialized nursing homes. Economic support from the government for financially struggling hospitals could help them staff appropriately.As nurses fare, so fare patients, because nurses are the canary in the coal mine for patient health. Patients deserve to have safe curative care prioritized over excessive health care profits.Theresa Brown, nurse and New York Times bestselling writer, is the author of\"Healing: When a Nurse Becomes a Patient,\"and\"The Shift: One Nurse, Twelve Hours, Four Patients' Lives.\"Brian Miller: Allow competition in hospital marketsAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF),over 91% of Americanspossess insurance coverage, yet according to data from the US Census Bureaunearly one in fivestill struggle to afford medical care. With the federal government's deficit totaling$217 billionin the month of August 2022 alone, andeconomy-wide inflation at 8.2% in September,policymakers can lower health care costs for patients and increase access without increasing governmental spending by injecting a dose of competition into hospital markets.With the recent political focus on corporate power and the ills of monopoly, thehospital industryis no exception and has come under the policy microscope. Ninety percent of metropolitan statistical areas are considered highly concentrated for hospital care,according to KFF, withhospitals buying up physician practicesand driving further consolidation.Researchers have demonstrated the harms of this lack of competition, with hospital consolidation leading tohigher insurance premiums,higher pricesandconsumer cost-sharing,anddecline in patient experience.Given thathospital and outpatient care comprise 50.4%of national health expenditures, according to research published in Health Affairs, it is no wonder that affordability remains an issue.Policymakers could drive down hospital costs byrepealing the banon physician-owned hospitalsfrom participating in the Medicare program, paving the way for physicians to open both new community hospitals and develop morespecialty hospitals,which would increase hospital market competition.Withrobust evidencedemonstrating that competition in outpatient care markets lower costs, policymakers could reformStark Law, whichprohibits physician referralfor designated health services to facilities in which the physician or a family member has a financial interest. Ironically, corporate self-referral isnot subject to these restrictions,and corporate health systems frequentlymandate internal referrals.By lifting the physician self-referral ban in managed Medicare or managed Medicaid settings that have checks and balances to avoid waste and abuse, physician-owned and operated enterprises would be in a position to compete with corporate enterprises. Corporate monopolies would face increased competition from new physician-owned hospitals and clinics. And with consolidationtied to outcomes such as mortality, addressing hospital monopoly power is not just an issue of finances: It could be a matter of life or death.Brian J. Miller, MD, MBA, MPH is a nonresident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and an assistant professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He served as a Special Advisor to the Federal Trade Commission in 2015.Syra Madad: Rebuild trust in scienceTrust in science has taken a major blow recently. APew Research Center surveyfound that Americans' trust in scientists is lower now than it was pre-pandemic.This couldn't come at a worse moment. We're living in a time whendisease outbreaksarerampant, and the need for communities to heed public health officials' guidance is more important than ever -- whether it's asking people to mask up to help mitigate the spread of an airborne-virus like SARS-CoV-2 or to remain up-to-date with vaccinations.But Americans are often struggling to discern between fact and fiction in an increasingly polarized nation, causing an unprecedented epidemic ofmisinformationthat can often spread faster and further than the truth.There are two things we must do immediately to jump start the slow and continuous process of regaining trust in science.First, building trust in science requires a human connection. We must leverage trusted messengers in all communities and start from a place of dialogue as opposed to just fact-sharing. Even with a fancy health official title, you're doomed to fail if you can't make a personal connection with the people you're trying to keep healthy. This is where local health departments play a significant role. They know their respective communities better than federal entities do.Second, building trust in science is a year-round job -- not something that can be done acutely during emergencies. Our cycle of panic and public health guidance during outbreaks, followed by neglect, erodes the relationships public health officials build with communities. We need to hear the voices of our public health officials, and see their faces, often and in times of non-emergency to establish trust for when crises strike.Syra Madad, DHSc, MSc, MCP, is an infectious disease epidemiologist, faculty at Boston University's Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases Policy and Research, senior director of the system-wide special pathogens program at NYC Health + Hospitals. She is also a fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. She tweets@syramadad.Max Richtman: Expand MedicaidIt's no secret that it can be hard to get things done in Washington. Health care reform is no exception. President Joe Biden's administration and Congress have made some noteworthy progress, with thepassage of legislationto lower prescription drug prices in theface of fierce oppositionfrom the GOP and Big Pharma. Unfortunately,efforts to expand Medicareto include dental, hearing and vision benefits perished with the failure of Biden's Build Back Better Plan, whichlacked unanimous support among Senate Democratsand gotnone from Republicans.With so little agreement between the parties on health policy, there is some lower-hanging fruit that can improve coverage for millions of Americans right now: Medicaid expansion.The Affordable Care Act empowered states to expand Medicaid to cover almost all adultswith incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line.It has been an unmitigated success in both red and blue states.Medicaid expansionhas radicallyreduced the number of uninsured Americansandboosted health outcomes, includingfewer premature deaths,among older adults. It has also contributed to areduction in health disparitiesfor women and people of color, according to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation.So far,38 statesand the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid -- including16 traditionally red or purple states.More than4 millionuninsured Americans would gain coverage if the remaining states followed suit, according to Kaiser Health News.It's a turnkey option that the Biden administration has made easier to implement throughspecial waivers.Voters in the holdout states that have yet to expand Medicaid should push their legislatures to join with the majority of states that have expanded the program. And they should keep this issue front of mind at the ballot box.Max Richtman is president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. He is former staff director of the US Senate Special Committee on Aging.Lala Tanmoy Das: Diversify the pool of doctorsOne of the biggest issues facing the American health care system are the disparities that keep many from accessing quality care. Medical education has a huge role to play in eliminating those disparities.The end goal is this: There should be a diverse community of doctors that represents the populations they serve.Studies showthatminority patients benefitfrom having minority doctors, yet the current makeup of the US physician workforce is not representative of population estimates.
