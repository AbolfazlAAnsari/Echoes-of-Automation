But logically, that motive makes no sense.Gov. Brian Kemp, who signed the bill into law, andSecretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who advocated for it, had already conceded that voter fraud played no role in recent election outcomes. InRaffensperger's words, \"we had safe, secure, honest elections,\" a conclusion shared by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, federal officials in former President Donald Trump's Department of Justice, and state and federal judges. And if fraud wasn't the real reason for those changes, what was?From the beginning, the entire \"voting fraud\" industry has been a bad-faith invention by the right to serve as cover for its voter suppression targeting minorities. We know that because every Republican administration in the last quarter of a century hastried desperately to find evidenceof such fraud on a scale sufficient to swing elections, and every such investigation has failed abysmally. When he served as Georgia secretary of state from 2010 to 2018, Kemptried and failedto find such fraud. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis continues to try to find it, and so far he, too, continues tocome up empty.And it's the consequences of that bad-faith narrative that ought to worry us. As we witnessed in 2020, Trump took the suspicion and distrust of the electoral system that the GOP had nurtured over decades and he repurposed it to an even more nefarious goal, transforming it from an excuse to suppress voting into an excuse to treat election outcomes as illegitimate altogether.Trump is still making that argument to this day,telling supportersat rallies this fall that \"I don't believe we'll have a fair election again. I don't believe it.\"That purposeful, corrosive cynicism has an impact on the very foundations of democratic self-government because it finds an audience.In SB 202, for example, Georgia Republicans added a clarifying sentence to a section of state law regarding how a voter, or elector, can legally challenge the eligibility of other voters to cast ballots.It now saysthat \"There shall not be a limit on the number of persons whose qualifications such elector may challenge.\" The new law also requires local election boards to hold a hearing on such challenges within 10 business days.If that sounds like an invitation to wreak chaos, it is exactly that.Around the state, conservatives are attempting to challenge the eligibility of tens of thousands of legally registered voters on extremely flimsy grounds and are growing frustrated that those challenges keep failing.In suburban Gwinnett County, for example, \"voting integrity\" activists have challenged the eligibility of more than 40,000 registered voters in the increasingly diverse, increasingly Democratic county, putting an incredible burden on the county's small elections staff. The challenges that have been acted upon so farhave been rejectedin a 3-2, party-line vote, with two Democrats and an independent outvoting Republicans.\"We are doing your job,\" one frustrated activist told the Gwinnett elections board at its October 19 meeting. \"Get your county in order or get your things in order.\"That's what happens when you sell people on a false narrative, then rewrite state law to encourage taking action on that false narrative. If voting isn't being suppressed so far, confidence in voting surely has been.Opinion by Jay BookmanTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
