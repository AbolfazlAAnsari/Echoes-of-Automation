No one appears more at risk than Twitter’sformer CEO Jack DorseyIt is an ironic turn of events since Dorsey supported thetakeover by Elon Muskand has called for all files to be released without filtering. Dorsey has the feel of a \"designated defendant,\" someone who was pushed forward by others to take any legal hit.On its face, Dorsey has vulnerability after the latest release. He was repeatedly asked by members of Congress about censoring and shadow-banning, which has now been confirmed in these files.Jack Dorsey at the Bitcoin convention at the Mana Convention Center in Wynwood on June 4, 2021, in Miami, Florida.(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)In September 2018, Dorsey testified under oath and denied what these files appear to now confirm. Rep. Mike Doyle, D., Pa., asked, \"Social media is being rigged to censor conservatives. Is that true of Twitter?\"TWITTER FILES REVEAL TRUMP BAN CAME AFTER MICHELLE OBAMA, OTHERS PRESSURED THE COMPANYDorsey responded, \"No.\"Doyle then asked \"Are you censoring people?\"\"No,\" Dorsey said.\"Twitter’s shadow-banning prominent Republicans… is that true?\" Doyle asked.Dorsey again said no.Dorsey was also asked about my prior testimony on private censorship in circumventing the First Amendment as a type of censorship by surrogate. Dorsey and the other CEOs were asked about my warning of a \"‘little brother’ problem, a problem which private entities do for the government that which it cannot legally do for itself.\" In response, Dorsey insisted that \"we don’t have a censoring department.\"Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testifies via video conference before Congress in 2021.(Reuters)It now appears that the entire company was operating as a censoring department. However, there were in fact super-censors. Dorsey did not mention the Strategic Response Team-Global Escalation Team (SRT-GET), which operated above what journalist Bari Weiss described as \"a level beyond official ticketing, beyond the rank-and-file moderators following the company’s policy on paper.\"That group reportedly included Vijaya Gadde, head of Legal, Policy and Trust; Yoel Roth, the global head of Trust and Safety; CEOs Jack Dorsey and Parag Agrawal, and others.Notably, others at the company made similar denials as Dorsey but may not have done so under oath. In 2018, Gadde and head of product Kayvon Beykpour expressly declared, \"We do not shadow-ban. And we certainly don't shadow-ban based on political viewpoints or ideology.\"‘TWITTER FILES’ MOST OVERLOOKED FINDING? THAT DORSEY, ZUCKERBERG AND HALF OF AMERICA SHRUG AT CENSORSHIPVijaya Gadde, head of Legal, Policy and Trust at Twitter.(Reuters/Mike Blake)Even if untrue, lying in public is generally not a crime. However, when you repeat a lie to federal investigators or Congress or the courts, it becomes a federal offense.The question is whether Dorsey was left in the dark on these decisions. He was reportedly a member of SRT-GET. However, some of the files indicate that these decisions may have been made without his knowledge. That includes the decision on the Hunter Biden laptop scandal, which Dorsey called a \"total mistake.\"Dorsey could quibble over the term \"shadow-banning\" but the question was obviously meant as a follow-up to the inquiry over \"rigging\" discourse on the platform. He could also stress other answers, where he tied \"shadow-banning\" to a more subjective notion of political bias. For example, Dorsey also repeated these statements in public, including an appearance with Sean Hannity on Fox, when he was asked if \"Twitter has ever been involved in shadow-banning, Dorsey again categorically denied such practices: \"We do not shadow-ban according to political ideology or viewpoint.\"For most people, Dorsey's comments clearly suggested that there was no shadow-banning. However, he could claim that he knew that they were shadow-banning but that they were not doing so \"according to political ideology or viewpoint.\" That is clearly refuted by the new files showing a hair-triggered censorship system directed against conservative and Republican posters.The other defense is lack of knowledge but, even if accepted, that will raise the question of whether this was a case of a designated defendant or willful blindness.In some cases, there is a suspicion that corporations will assign some executive to sign off on compliance or certifications as the fall guy or designated defendant if things go wrong. The chump is often a junior lawyer or executive who takes personal responsibility for certifying a false fact.Attorney General Merrick Garland announces Jack Smith as special counsel to oversee the Justice Department's investigation of former President Donald Trump, at the Justice Department in Washington, Friday, Nov. 18, 2022.(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)Dorsey is clearly no chump or junior executive. The question is then whether this was a case of willful blindness or an attempt by other executives like Gadde or Roth to give him plausible deniability by keeping him in the dark.  He then became the public face in unequivocally and confidently denying practices like shadow-banning.The greatest defense for Dorsey may be found in theJustice Departmentitself. Any prosecution of Twitter executives could prove a hard sell for Attorney General Merrick Garland, whose department has been repeatedly accused of pronounced political bias.While Garland has aggressively pursued contempt sanctions against Trump associates, it is not clear if he would prove as aggressive with Democratic allies like Dorsey orother Twitter executives. He could face that question if the House under the GOP pursues perjury or contempt sanctions.Dorsey once said about Twitter that \"It's really complex to make something simple.\" He may now be hoping that hisanswers before Congresswere simple enough to make any prosecution complex.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JONATHAN TURLEYJonathan Turley is a Fox News Media contributor and the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University. He is the author of \"The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage\" (Simon & Schuster, June 18, 2024).Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.
