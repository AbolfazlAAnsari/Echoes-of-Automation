A programme of tax cuts and privatisation must do more than send the pulses of rightwing Tory MPs racing. The prime minister is by instinct a deeply unserious politician. With the NHSclose to collapse, Mr Johnson offers only bombast. Comparing the healthcare system to a DVD movie rental service in an “age of Netflix” might sound adventurous in a press release. But proposing bluster rather than detailed plans to deal with an NHS breakdown is likely to be electorally counterproductive.Conservative MPs might fret about the absence of anyone suitable to succeed Mr Johnson. The cabinet lacks the courage to tell him to go. But the prime minister is a dead man walking. He survives because no one wants to be responsible for finishing him off. This is only delaying the inevitable. The betting is that the Tory leadership rules will bechangedto allow the prime minister to face another challenge sooner than next June. The trigger for this might be MPs on thestandards committeedeciding in autumn that Mr Johnson misled parliament about No 10’s partying during lockdown.Paul Goodman, the editor of the Conservative Home website,wrotesagely that it would be better for Mr Johnson “to go now as master of his own fate, undefeated at the ballot box … rather than be forced out”. Unfortunately, these words will be unheeded. The country needs new leadership, one that can produce policies, not just play to the gallery. Mr Johnson is comfortable with lying in politics. Despite agreeing on a customs border in the Irish Sea to get Brexit done, he nowimprobablyclaims he did not. Mr Johnson was never fit to be prime minister. He has not been able to face up to the difficult choices ahead. Britain should be led by someone who can."
