And how can we ensure that every worker has equal access to dignity and opportunity? Workers and their families are depending on us to quickly adapt by looking at new policy and training approaches. We need to ensure our labour and employment laws continue to protect workers in this changed landscape, while supporting business growth and new technology that create more jobs. That's why I established the Ontario Workforce Recovery Advisory Committee to explore the future of work.
