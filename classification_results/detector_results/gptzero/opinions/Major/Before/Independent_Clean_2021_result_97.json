There seems intention on the corporation's behalf to champion the north as the main beneficiary of the \"levelling up\" agenda, while I believe the spread of need and deprivation lies across a variety of areas.Thank you for at least drawing attention to the problems, so that we may not be totally overlooked.Susan BertramAddress suppliedMust be a better wayJohn Rentoul's report on different voting systems used in the UK (Your guide to the different voting systems on 6 May, 29 March) is an interesting one. The Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly systems have a certain appeal with the \"added members\" chosen to provide a measure of proportional representation. But the centralised control of party lists for added members adds a whiff of \"it's who you know\" that some find distasteful.Would it not be possible to operate a \"dynamic added member\" list, where the list is self-chosen from the second (and third?) placed candidates in constituencies, ranked according to the percentage of the local vote they can secure?Read more:•Priti Patel doesn't like my tone, apparently - or is it the facts that worry her?•Rape culture at private schools isn't about to change - parents are paying for this sense of entitlement•As lockdown eases, I'm planning the event of the year - a disco for boomersPriti Patel doesn't like my tone, apparently - or is it the facts that worry her?Rape culture at private schools isn't about to change - parents are paying for this sense of entitlementAs lockdown eases, I'm planning the event of the year - a disco for boomersThey have submitted themselves to the scrutiny of at least the local electorate; often their failure to get elected says more about the popularity or party of the winning first choice than their own ability. A second-placed candidate with 49 per cent of the local vote will secure more \"real\" votes than many winning candidates where there are three-and four-way splits. A five per cent threshold could be applied to prevent abuse by the likes of the Monster Raving Loonies, etc.Dr John BaileyPrestonLabour's righteous wrathWith Labour dropping in the polls, everyone seems to be asking what can be missing from their public image. Read Jess Phillips's deeply felt and near-despairing article (Priti Patel doesn't like my tone, apparently - or is it the facts that worry her?, 28 March) and you have the answer. Anger at injustice. Righteous wrath. Fire! What's the problem? Isn't there enough fuel?Noel ChadwickCumbriaVaccine distribution must be worldwideThe global community should avoid a rich-poor divide between the western world and countries of the global south in how coronavirus vaccines are distributed.Right now, over 30 countries worldwide haven't injected a single person, while roughly three-quarters of all doses have gone to people in just 10 countries.Scientists warn that such disparities will not only haunt poorer countries, but will also affect rich ones, as the continued spread of the virus will allow it to mutate in ways that undermine vaccines for years to come.The toll in Africa could be especially profound. Although the continent has 17 per cent of the world's people, so far it has administered just 2 per cent of the vaccine doses given globally. Kenya, with one of Africa's more prosperous economies, estimates that it will inoculate only 30 per cent of its 50 million people by 2023.The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported last week that the second wave of Covid-19, which began at the end of 2020, has hit African countries more aggressively, with a 30 per cent rise in infections compared to the first wave. In Kenya, positivity rates are over 20 per cent, with 123,000 total reported cases, and 14,000 new cases this month alone.Although Africa showed some resilience to the disease during last year's first phase, the WHO warns that rising cases threaten fragile healthcare systems in the region. Healthcare workers are currently bearing the brunt of the pandemic in Africa, with 267 African health workers being infected every day, the WHO report.Most African countries are relying on Covax, the global mechanism for procuring and distributing vaccines. But with Covax projecting that it will inoculate just 20 per cent of Africa's population this year, there is a long road ahead if we are to avoid a devastating split between \"us\" and \"them\", with the consequent undermining of the global effort to bring the pandemic under control.Ray JordanCEO of Self Help Africa"
