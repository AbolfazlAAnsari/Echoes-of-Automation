Use this western commission to define the West as a \"distinct society,\" to propose constitutional and other reforms necessary to express this distinctiveness and attach as an appendix a draft constitution for the western provinces based on this perspective.Organize and finance constituency-based election campaigns to replace narrow provincialists in the British Columbia legislature and on the Vancouver, Victoria and Burnaby municipal councils with broadminded Canadians dedicated to making B.C. the gateway, not the roadblock, to Canada's Asia-Pacific trade.Encourage the leadership of the CPC to adopt the \"regional lieutenant system\" and assist in recruiting and supporting a \"strong western lieutenant\" for the current leader. Note the effectiveness of this model in the past: John A. Macdonald had George-Ãƒ&;#8240;tienne Cartier as his Quebec lieutenant; Wilfrid Laurier had Clifford Sifton and Frank Oliver in the West; Brian Mulroney had Don Mazankowski, etc. The next western leader of the CPC needs regional lieutenants to give him greater national clout.Follow a \"two-pronged approach\" politically to advancing Alberta and western interests within the federation, pursuing both an increased voice for Alberta/western interests in Ottawa, and an autonomist route of more Alberta/West and less Ottawa, with the secession threat in the background.The winner of this joint endeavour? Alberta, the West and Canada.National PostJack M.
