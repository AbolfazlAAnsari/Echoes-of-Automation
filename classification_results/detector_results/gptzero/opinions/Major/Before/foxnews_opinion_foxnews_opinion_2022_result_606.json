This drains the tax base and puts a heavier burden on less-educated, poorer residents who simply may not be able to afford to move.I made the decision to leave Chicago in January 2022. I was headed for the red clay of Georgia. I had picked out my new house and had my eyes on a brand new bass boat.

What did was the fact that the same weekend there were 10 people killed and 62 people wounded by gunfire in Chicago… and no one seemed to care.I decided to do some research and the findings were staggering. Through the end of August 2022, 2,352 people had been shot in Chicago, 448 fatally. In 2021 there were 797 homicides in Chicago and 3,561 shootings, per the Chicago Police Department.Chicago had a homicide rateof 28.6 for every 100,000 people, significantly above the national homicide rate of 6.5 murders per 100,000.
