            "inputText": "By Dany H. AssafRamadan is a month-long period of observance in the Muslim calendar, during which we fast from sunup to sundown and reflect on life's blessings and what's most important to us. It is also marked by greetings to Muslim Canadians from our political class.\"Sending my warmest wishes to Muslims celebrating Eid al-Fitr and marking the end of Ramadan,\" wrote Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\"Eid Mubarak to all celebrating! After a month of prayer, fasting, and self-reflection, I hope you enjoy tonight's celebrations,\" said Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole.\"Eid Mubarak! ... Now, as the holy month of Ramadan comes to a close, I send my best wishes to all those celebrating Eid al-Fitr,\" tweeted the NDP's Jagmeet Singh.As the sun set on the final day of Ramadan this week and we celebrated Eid al Fitr, we received these kind wishes of \"Eid Mubarak!\"Welcome as these courtesies are, what I'm really wishing for this Eid is for our federal leaders to confront a rising threat to our most important rights in Canada's second largest province. What I want is for someone to unequivocally reaffirm the simple Canadian promise that anyone's dreams can become reality no matter how you worship, and wherever you live across our great land. Because if even one of our children is robbed of their dreams, it is a collective nightmare.The dreams of Canadian children in Quebec are being crushed by Bill 21, \"An Act respecting the laicity of the State.\" Passed in 2019, the legislation bans public workers in \"positions of authority\" from wearing religious symbols while on duty. Supporters of the bill claim that it is intended to establish religious neutrality. In fact, it does the opposite. It explicitly requires police officers, court officers, teachers and school principals to dress contrary to their personal beliefs.Now being fought in the court by the National Council of Canadian Muslims and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, among others, Bill 21 circumscribes the futures of Muslim and other Canadian children. They can no longer dream, as children do, of being a policeman, a schoolteacher, or a fireman anymore, simply because they wear a hijab, kippa, or turban.On the one hand, I am bewildered that the proud and historic Quebec I've experienced could see itself so fragile as to be threatened by a schoolteacher in a hijab. On the other hand, it is outrageous that in Canada, in 2021, people in Quebec are being forced to make a choice between their deeply held beliefs, their fundamental identities, and their professions, and more so because our political leaders are allowing it to happen.Raymond J. de Souza: In Legault's Quebec, there's no room for religious expression, or diversity of thought(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/raymond-j-de-souza-in-legaults-quebec-theres-no-room-for-religious-expression-or-diversity-of-thought)Colby Cosh: Quebec's Bill 21 takes a hit in court, but is not down for the count(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/colby-cosh-quebecs-bill-21-takes-a-hit-in-court-but-is-not-down-for-the-count)It is almost surreal watching our society cleave before our eyes, swallowing up the liberalism that we've known and shared in Canada for generations. We sit here smugly (and rightly) decrying the excesses of U.S. politics, when a party seems to be tossing fundamental rights and democratic principles out the door for political expediency, or worse. But how are we really different on this issue?Bill 21 is not some vague question to be pondered at leisure and left to the courts to decide. Not with our basic rights and freedoms in jeopardy.Let's think ahead. Once freedom of worship is denied in Quebec, where does it end? Would there be a movement in Alberta, my home province, or elsewhere in Canada, to use the Notwithstanding Clause to restrict the rights of its French-speaking citizens? Personally, I could not imagine a Canada without Quebec and the richness its culture offers all of us. I would hope Quebec would not rob others of what we can offer.A man wears a yarmulke during a demonstration opposing the Quebec government's Bill 21, in Montreal on April 14, 2019.Yet perhaps with the exception of Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister, our leading politicians dither on Bill 21. Lip service is paid to Muslim Canadians, and to Canada's traditions of openness, tolerance and acceptance, with nice Ramadan greetings. But what good are they while our very place in Canada's second-largest province is being stripped from us in broad daylight? It's like offering to paint a house on fire. Useless and oblivious.It is past time for our leaders to have a brave and honest conversation with our brothers and sisters in Quebec. Picking on vulnerable minorities is not going to solve what is troubling Quebecers, or alleviate their anxieties. Especially as a minority within Canada, one that has suffered mistreatment of its own, Quebec should be a champion of minority rights, not their destroyer.Every Ramadan, I'm also reminded of how Muslims came to Canada over a century ago, my family included, and how this country's embrace was big enough for us all. So this Eid Al-Fitr, my wish is that our politicians say loudly and clearly that Canada will always be a place where who you are will never determine what you can be, from coast to coast to coast.Dany H.
