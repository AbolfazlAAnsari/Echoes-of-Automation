            "inputText": "Last month in these pages, we argued for a \"New National Policy(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/canada-needs-a-new-national-policy)\" - a comprehensive program to ensure that Canada emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic more unified and economically resilient. Events since that time, however, principally in the United States but also here in Canada, have demonstrated that what ails us is not only political divisions and economic uncertainty, but a loss of faith in our nation's institutions, especially, but not only, the police.This trend is understandable, especially in a country that does so little to teach history or civics. Yet the fact is that Canada has enjoyed constitutional stability in the face of numerous global upheavals for over a century and a half precisely because we have a rule of law and durable democratic institutions that truly foster \"peace, order and good government.\"On the other hand, there seems to be a growing perception, which is not entirely unfounded, that our historic institutions have become opaque and divorced from the people whom they are intended to serve. Question period in Parliament looks ever more like performance art, and significant decisions affecting Canadians' liberties and interests are increasingly made by unelected and often unaccountable administrators, the police being only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Restoring the public's faith in our institutions will therefore require a parliamentary revival - that is, shifting the institutional balance from the executive and judicial branches back to the legislative, thereby enhancing the role that elected representatives play in our democracy.In the legislative branch, this means ensuring greater independence for federal and provincial legislators. Reforming Canada's election finance laws to allow for greater participation of non-party-affiliated \"independents\" would certainly be a step in the right direction, but it would by no means solve the problem (full disclosure: one of us is representing independent Ontario MPP Randy Hillier in his constitutional challenge to Ontario's discriminatory election finance law). Party discipline in Canada is perhaps the strictest in the democratic world and our elected representatives too often subordinate themselves to the will of the government or their party, in the hopes that it will further their political careers. The embarrassing shutdown of Parliament during the COVID-19 crisis is certainly the most recent and acute example, but it by no means stands alone. It is emblematic of a legislative branch that has gradually and voluntarily abdicated its responsibilities.This problem could be mitigated by increasing the number of MPs from the current 338 to 500. The United Kingdom has 650 MPs who rightfully enjoy a reputation of being far more independently minded than their Canadian counterparts. Parliamentary culture in the U.K. is very different, but at least one reason for this is structural: each MP is far less likely to be elevated to the governing cabinet (there are currently 365 Conservatives MPs, 28 more than the total number of MPs in Canada) and this fact makes them more likely to place constituents and conscience ahead of party.Increasing the number of Canadian MPs by 162 may seem like a lot, but it would hardly be excessive for a country of nearly 40 million with one of the largest land masses in the world. When former prime minister Pierre Trudeau was first elected in 1968, there were 264 seats in the House to serve a population of just over 20 million, which meant fewer than 80,000 people per MP. Increasing the number of MPs to 500 would achieve roughly this same proportion. It would decrease the power of the government in the House, while also providing a larger talent pool of prospective government ministers. And, arguably, it would facilitate government renewal between elections, as we have seen from time to time in the U.K. (the most recent example being Boris Johnson's complete overhaul of his cabinet and the government agenda when Theresa May resigned and he became prime minister in July 2019).When it comes to the courts, parliamentary revival means appointing judges who demonstrate fidelity to the proper separation of powers under our Constitution. This should not be mistaken for a crass conception of \"judicial restraint.\" Judges are duty-bound to invalidate unconstitutional laws; but in exercising that crucial role, they must not overstep. When the Supreme Court interprets the rights enumerated in the charter, for example, beyond what the text can bear, it effectively amends the Constitution by judicial fiat. And the message to legislatures is that they should take the path of least resistance and punt sensitive socio-economic and political issues to the courts.Constitutions are, by their very nature, designed to prevent change, or at least slow it down substantially. Not surprisingly, then, it is far more difficult to revisit and overturn a judicial precedent than a legislative enactment. This has become especially apparent in the wake of the killing of George Floyd and other police abuses. Many are now calling for police unions to be weakened or even abolished, but this is going to be a challenging feat in Canada, where the Supreme Court has spent the last two decades inventing new rights for unions and, in the process, removing a classic public policy issue from the reach of democratic majorities.Finally, if parliamentary revival is to be achieved, Parliament and the provincial legislatures must take back the control they have ceded to the unelected administrators in the executive. Too many statutes delegate overbroad and indeterminate powers to administrators (such as \"to protect the public interest\"), who then make largely discretionary decisions that have significant impacts on the lives of Canadians. The administrative state is a necessary function of our complex modern society, but legislatures can curb its excesses by delegating more specific powers using clear and precise language.As part of reining in administrative bodies, the legislatures should take the lead in making Canada's police forces more accountable to the public they serve and protect. The government must oversee and direct police policy, and police independence must be narrowly confined to specific operational matters. In achieving this civilian control, the government must itself be constrained by legislation and parliamentary oversight.To be clear, we are not suggesting parliamentary revival will cure all of Canada's social ills. Successive governments will undoubtedly struggle with issues of alienation and injustice for many years to come. We are proposing only that the decision-making process be returned to its proper forum - the people's elected representatives - so that prudent laws can be properly deliberated and enacted, police and other administrators can be held to account and the core institutions that have long sustained Canada as a free and democratic society can once again earn the trust of Canadians.National PostAsher Honickman is a partner at Matthews Abogado LLP and president of Advocates for the Rule of Law, a registered charity.
