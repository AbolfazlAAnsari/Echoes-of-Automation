But I rarely discuss the issue, because I am expected to affirm my belief in two contradictory tenets: that affirmative action is vitally important, and that it really doesn’t much affect hiring and admissions decisions.William ColeSitges, SpainCurbing Domestic ViolenceTo the Editor:Re “A Tear-Streaked Face and a Scramble to Help in Maine” (front page, Nov. 29):Ellen Barry’s reporting of a case of domestic violence in Maine is familiar.One in three womenhave experienced rape, physical violence and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime. The numbers continue to grow, as the systems in place fail to stem this terror.Tanya Neal’s last text before jumping off the bridge was that her boyfriend was right, “I’m no good,” and to me, that is the core of the issue. We must make victims understand that physical violence is not a form of love, but control, and not something they have done to deserve. They need to realize their value, self-worth and what the experience of a healthy relationship looks like.Efforts to deal with this issue are not working. We need to reach out to charitable foundations with the resources to get the right information out every day. With such a campaign our most vulnerable girls and women can understand that it is not their fault, but something that they have the power to end, and they are not alone. We need to stop this shameful cycle of pain and loss. Knowledge is power.Midge ColemanHillsdale, N.J.Political Captives to Wealthy DonorsTo the Editor:Re “G.O.P. Donors Flock to Back 2 Democrats” (front page, Nov. 22):Reports of Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema stuffing their campaign coffers with donations from conservative donors is a perfect example of the rot at the heart today’s politics — the stranglehold that big-money donors have on elected officials, Republicans and Democrats alike.Until we excise this money cancer, little will be done to move toward a more equitable society, or address challenges like climate change. But this will require radical change, like limiting political donations to individuals who reside in the senator’s or representative’s state or district. Furthermore, donations should be limited to an amount per donor and per election cycle. Candidates must also abide by this restriction, i.e., no self-funded campaigns.These changes will force candidates to appeal to a wide range of voters, instead of relying on, and becoming captive of, wealthy donors. Yes, it will be fought tooth and nail by the power elite, but I fear that without a wholesale departure from the current system, today’s political dysfunction may lead to the loss of democracy itself.Rick BlumBedford, Mass.High Rate of Premature BirthsTo the Editor:Re “Why Are There So Many Premature Births in America?,” by Jessica Grose (Opinion, nytimes.com, Nov. 20):The United States has thehighest rate of premature birthsamong industrialized nations. Our premature-birth rate is worse than some nonindustrialized nations. This fact is frankly appalling. Also appalling and directly related is the fact that we are the only industrialized nation without universal health care.We cannot commit to improving our health care outcomes without first committing to improve our system of providing health care.Lawrence A.
