Ducey's administration has been placing enormous emptyshipping containersalong an eastern stretch of the Grand Canyon State's border with Mexico.Topped with razor wire, this makeshift barrier is supposed to help stop illegal immigration.\"Arizona is going to do the job that Joe Biden refuses to do -- secure the border in any way we can,\" Duceysaid in October. \"We're not backing down.\"Ducey began erectinghis border wallin the summer, near Yuma, in the southwest corner of Arizona. Another section is now going up in Cochise County.But not only is Ducey's project likely illegal, it is also expensive, ineffective and dangerous. Instead of cooperating with the federal government or Arizona's Gov.-elect Katie Hobbs, Ducey is staging a massive border stunt which will not address any of our immigration issues.Legally, Ducey's \"wall\" is problematic. The Supreme Courthas been clear, most recently in 2012 withArizona v. US, that immigration policy is the jurisdiction of the federal government. In other words, states and governors cannot take such matters into their own hands, no matter how frustrated they may be with federal immigration policy. Some of the borderlands where Ducey has placed empty containers actuallybelong to the federal governmentandnative American tribes.Ducey brushes aside these factsin a lawsuitthat he filed against the government. He feels that his actions are justified because of what he terms an \"unprecedented crisis\" at the border with \"floods of illegal border crossings.\" Nice try.Just because the governor asserts his right to build a border wall does not mean he has legal authority to do so. Plus, Ducey will only be in office until January 5, and Hobbshasn't decidedhow she will get rid of the multi-ton containers. So he's saddling her with the task of cleaning up his mess.The Associated Press estimates that Ducey's current effortswill cost about $95 million. That's a lot of money to spend on a structure that is really no barrier to potential border-crossers.Photos of protestersatop the wall show that it is easily scaled, and there are gaps between the containers in multiple places.Ducey's wall is also potentially dangerous. In August, Univision reported on two of the containersnear Yuma tipping over, probably from strong winds. This represents a danger to migrants, border patrol agents and firefighters in the area. Would Ducey take responsibility if another container tipped and injured or killed someone?Then there is the environmental impact of Ducey's wall.Conservation groupssay that it imperils wildlife, endangered species and public lands. As a co-founder of the Center for Biological Diversity pointed outin a statement, \"There are 3,700 [border] agents covering the Tucson Sector alone, not to mention helicopters, drones and hundreds of cameras. We're in an extinction crisis, and it's reckless to sacrifice a critical wildlife corridor and harm endangered animals so Ducey can score political points.\"There is no question that the southern border has lately seen record numbers of unauthorized border crossers. Border agentsencountered more than 2 million migrantsduring fiscal year 2022, up from 1.7 million in 2021, according toUS Customs and Border Protection statistics. These numbers are likely to rise in December, once theBiden administration liftsTitle 42, a Trump-era policy that expelled migrants on public health grounds.Still, Ducey does not have the right to commandeer border policy, let alone interfere with migrants' lawful right to claim asylum. In fact, the Biden administration hasits own plansto close some of the gaps along the border near Yuma, and Ducey's structures there arein the way.The only person to benefit from Ducey's wall is the governor himself. It has thrust him intothe national spotlight, and perhaps given him more name recognition with conservative voters. Sadly, that's what his version of a border wall is all about: himself.This is reminiscent of the actions taken by Republican governors this summer who transported migrants fromred states to blue states. We are looking at political theater, not legitimate immigration proposals.Our country's dysfunctional immigration system is sorely in need of an overhaul, and possible solutions exist. Consider thebipartisan proposalfrom Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. It would offer a pathway to citizenship for undocumented people brought to the US as children, while extendingTitle 42and increasing border security. Though it may be imperfect, it is a serious proposal and worthy of consideration.In contrast, Ducey's wall amounts to a large-scale publicity stunt. It causes problems, instead of solving them -- and represents a monument to misguided thinking.Opinion by Raul A. ReyesTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
