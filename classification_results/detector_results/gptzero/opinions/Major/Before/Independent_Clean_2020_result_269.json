At any one time we support over 300 people who live at home in the capital and in West Lothian. One way we do this is through day therapy sessions which support people at end of life, both physically and emotionally.Due to restrictions brought on by the pandemic, we are adapting the ways we work and finding creative solutions to ensure patients don't miss out on this vital service. We now provide virtual consultations, coffee mornings, gentle exercise and relaxation online, giving our patients the opportunity to engage with others and tackle the loneliness and isolation brought on by local restrictions.The people that we care for don't have the luxury of time and it's important that we continue to help people live while they are dying.Libby MiltonClinical services lead, Marie CurieLabelsBy condemning those who give asylum seekers and refugees the benefit of the rule of law as \"do-gooders\", has Priti Patel self-identified as a \"do-badder?\"Sasha SimicLondonI won't fall for itWhile I agree completely with David Wallis's sentiment in his letter that the Immigration Service has acted, and continues to act, in the way one might expect of an organisation which has hostility to immigration so thoroughly embedded in its culture, I do not believe we should be grateful to an unknown Home Office employee for leaking the government's ideas. I believe the government deliberately leaked its own ideas, to \"test the water\", while also appealing to a certain section of Tory core voters who believe the right-wing propaganda that Britain is awash with illegal immigrants taking all the jobs and living off government hand-outs.As time goes by, and more becomes known about the behaviour of the Immigration Service, the more I am inclined to believe that anyone with \"sufficient humanity\" has long since left. Only the racists, and those with no compassion are left, to happily do the will of one racially motivated home secretary after another.David CurranFeltham, MiddlesexRead moreCoronavirus: Boris Johnson admits he doesn't know how many contacts have been missed after more than 15,000 positive cases untracedBoris Johnson has failed to acknowledge the role he's played in growing 'fatigue' with pandemic rulesTrump's personal assistant tests positive for coronavirusThe remarkable rise of Priti Patel"
