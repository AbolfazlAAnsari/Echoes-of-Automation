Although some did better than others - Manitoba's Brian Pallister and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe got B averages - every leader ended up with some low marks.Respect for democracy and rule of law was particularly lacking. Most of the country's provincial governments - Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Alberta and British Columbia - proposed or passed laws that allow, or would have allowed, premiers to rule like kings by amending or suspending laws without the consent of legislatures. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau thumbed his nose at the democratic norms when he replaced half of daily question periods with press briefings, and tried to give his minority government the power to tax and spend without parliamentary approval until 2022.Some premiers also disrespected freedom of religion. Although it was clear from the beginning that parking lot church services were a safe alternative to risky indoor gatherings, only a few premiers, like Ontario's Doug Ford and Alberta's Jason Kenney, gave their blessings to these gatherings. Quebec Premier FranÃ§ois Legault and P.E.I. Premier Dennis King continued to ban religious gatherings well into June - long after restaurants and shopping centres had reopened.Freedom of expression and assembly felt illegal in much of the country in the spring due to limits on group sizes that ranged from two people in Quebec to 50 in B.C., but the Constitution is the supreme law that overrules all other laws, so premiers can't actually ban public protests. That didn't stop some of them from trying. Premier Ford famously called anti-lockdown protesters \"a bunch of yahoos\" and suggested that they were \"breaking the law,\" despite no tickets being handed out by police. Premier Ball falsely claimed that protesting crab fishers only had a right to gather in \"normal circumstances.\"Privacy rights, protected under Section 8 of the charter, also took some blows. Ontario created a creepy database of people who tested positive for COVID-19. It was supposed to protect first responders but seemed unnecessary and ripe for snooping by police. The Ford government smartened up and abandoned the database but not until after 95,000 searches had been done and the province was sued. Premier Legault, meanwhile, mused about asking the provincial police to use cellphone location data to track people who violated COVID-19 orders.It wasn't just Newfoundland's premier who interfered with mobility rights. Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and New Brunswick all put up roadblocks at provincial boundaries to keep their fellow Canadians out. Quebec's border closures were perplexing considering its residents posed the biggest risk to others.We recognize that the pandemic is among the greatest challenges our leaders have ever faced, and we appreciate the quick action our leaders took to save lives. But our premiers and the prime minister have a duty to respect constitutional rights and freedoms. Although they weren't perfect, Premiers Pallister and Moe showed that it is possible to respect the Constitution while keeping Canadians safe from COVID-19. We hope our politicians keep this in mind if we're struck by a second wave and calls for new restrictions.National PostJoanna Baron is executive director, Christine Van Geyn is litigation director and Josh Dehaas is a law intern with the Canadian Constitution Foundation.Josh Dehaas: COVID Alert protects our privacy - but should still concern us(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/josh-dehaas-covid-alert-protects-our-privacy-but-should-still-concern-us)Marni Soupcoff: Outbreaks are not an excuse to trample on our rights(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/marni-soupcoff-outbreaks-are-not-an-excuse-to-trample-on-our-rights) !@COPYRIGHT=© 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.
