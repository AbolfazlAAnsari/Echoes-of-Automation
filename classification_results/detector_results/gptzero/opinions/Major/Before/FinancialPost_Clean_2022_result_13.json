            "inputText": "Franco Terrazzano and Peter Shawn TaylorCOVID-19 has had a dramatic impact on every country in the world, even those that haven't experienced the disease. The tiny Pacific nation of Nauru, for example, remains one of the few countries with zero reported cases of the coronavirus. Yet, according to the International Monetary Fund, it has spent eight per cent of its GDP on COVID-19 programs - proportionately more than many other countries with substantial death tolls.The case of big-spending, COVID-19-free Nauru points to the enormous variations in pandemic spending around the globe. Some countries, including Canada, have pushed their budgets to historic highs and taken on massive new debts while others have been far more restrained. Two years into the pandemic, it is clear that more government spending does not guarantee better results.A 2021 study by Christina Romer, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, comparing direct COVID-19 expenditures across selected OECD countries offers many intriguing insights into how governments spent in the first phase of the pandemic.Romer's data, which includes expenditures implemented or announced up to July 2020, shows that the biggest spending governments during the early days of the pandemic were the United States and New Zealand, each at 11.5 per cent of GDP, followed closely by Canada at 10.1 per cent. Four of the top five biggest spenders were wealthy, English-speaking countries. Canada's spending was more than double that of other advanced countries, such as France, Spain and Italy.Romer investigated several possible reasons for this disparity and concluded it wasn't the size of the national health crisis that determined the size of the response. There was no evidence countries with high COVID-19 mortality rates spent more on the pandemic than countries with lower rates, or vice versa.The only significant factor, according to Romer, was the creditworthiness of each country: \"Countries in 2020 appear to have been constrained in their fiscal choices ... by their ability to borrow\" (emphasis added). In other words, governments spent as much as they could.OECD countries with poor bond rating scores, such as Italy and Greece, spent substantially less than countries with higher credit ratings. Canada, which began the pandemic with a top-ranked AAA credit rating, was one of those countries that could and did borrow vast amounts. (Our credit rating has since dropped as the result of the spending spree.)Romer suggests these big-spending countries were driven by \"the unique terror engendered by the pandemic.\" But if rich, terror-stricken countries simply spent as much as possible when COVID hit, does this mean spending to the max was the best strategy? More recent data suggests not.The nearby chart compares all G20 countries on the basis of the IMF's most recent data on COVID-related expenditures by governments on individuals, business and institutions. This encompasses \"on-budget\" or direct spending, as distinct from loan guarantees, backstops and other \"off-budget\" financial arrangements.According to the IMF, Canada is the fifth largest spender, with pandemic spending totaling 15.9 per cent of GDP. The top spot is once again held by the U.S., at a stunning 25.4 per cent. And again, four of the top five spots are occupied by wealthy English-speaking countries. At the bottom is Mexico, with a paltry 0.7 per cent of GDP spent on COVID-19 programs.Echoing Romer, the evidence from the chart suggests no apparent relationship between spending historically large sums of borrowed money and better health or economic outcomes during the pandemic. Judging by its high COVID-19 mortality rate, the U.S. appears to have gotten a very poor return on all that spending. Its death toll of 251 per 100,000 population is slightly worse than Mexico's (234 per 100,000), though Mexico spent almost nothing on COVID-19.Canada's 81 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 is slightly better than average, but our spending is extremely high. The efficiency leader among democratic nations is South Korea, with a mortality rate of 11 per 100,000 - a fraction of what Canada experienced - and COVID-19 expenditures of just 6.4 per cent of its GDP. Caution is obviously necessary when linking government spending with COVID-19 deaths, since public health policies, culture and geography also play major roles in mortality rates. That said, increased spending does not appear to guarantee better health results.Terence Corcoran: In Canada, follow the money + the ideas(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-in-canada-follow-the-money-the-ideas)Cody Ciona: We need even-handed limits on protest(https://financialpost.com/opinion/cody-ciona-we-need-even-handed-limits-on-protest)William Watson: Giving comfort to Putin and Xi(https://financialpost.com/opinion/william-watson-giving-comfort-to-putin-and-xi)The same goes for protecting the economy. Among the above-average spenders, only Australia exhibited above-average GDP growth in 2020, and only the United Kingdom and Italy outperformed the average in 2021. By and large, the best economic performances can be found in countries that spent less than average on COVID-19 policies - and, more importantly, locked down less aggressively. South Korea again stands out for its combination of below-average spending and above-average economic results.Here's the key takeaway for Canadian taxpayers: our governments racked up huge debts during the pandemic, but we still didn't get the best health or economic results. Disappointing results among big-spending countries are mainly driven by the fact much of that spending was motivated by panic rather than rational or efficient policy-making. Romer points to numerous examples of \"ineffective and wasteful\" COVID-19 fiscal policies in the U.S.The same holds for Canada. Take the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), for example. In September 2020, it was estimated that every job saved by CEWS cost taxpayers $25,000 per month, which is $300,000 per year. Hardly a wise investment.And according to the Bank of Canada, while the average Canadian adult suffered a $1,600 reduction in working income in 2020, they received $3,400 in additional government transfers, for a net gain of $1,800 - which is why savings accounts boomed during the pandemic.As a result of COVID-19 largesse, Canada's federal debt-to-GDP ratio is set to grow by nearly two-thirds from its pre-pandemic level. The inevitable result will be to severely constrain future generations' ability to meet future needs. For Canadian taxpayers, the impact of the fiscal response to the pandemic is likely to last longer - maybe much longer - than the disease itself. It's now time for the federal government to end its pandemic subsidies.Franco Terrazzano is federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation.
