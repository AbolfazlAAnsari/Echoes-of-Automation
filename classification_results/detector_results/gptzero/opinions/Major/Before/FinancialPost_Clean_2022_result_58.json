And the Indian government's Innovations for Defence Excellence(https://idex.gov.in/about-idex) program will tap into the country's booming innovation eco-system, the world's third-largest, to launch the next generation of defence start-ups.The bad news is that while President Biden and others are working to improve western cooperation with India, Canada is entirely missing in action. Given the close Indo-Canadian ties, and Canada's security interests across the Indo-Pacific, one would think that Ottawa would bring ambition to this growing relationship between India and the West. Yet whether it's the security cooperation of the Quad or AUKUS, negotiations for a new trading bloc that would include India, the U.S. and other leading Asian economies, or cooperation with Pacific island states, Canada has simply been left out of the conversation.With its advanced defence industry and leading innovation ecosystem, Canada has a lot to offer India and the Indo-Pacific in building the 21st century defence industry base. Canadian companies could benefit from the opportunities from a major market like India and take advantage of its innovations. And India could benefit in having Canada serve as a supplier of trustworthy, high-quality defence equipment. Both nations would benefit from collaborating on defence technology and building on the desire for a stronger trading relationship.Canada has already fallen behind its closest allies, the U.S. and Australia, in building a partnership with India. As the Indo-Pacific continues to rise in importance, it is in the Canadian interest to define a leading role for itself with India toward a more secure and prosperous world.Shuvaloy Majumdar is Munk Senior Fellow and heads the Foreign Policy &; National Security Program at the Macdonald Laurier Institute.
