It's a key principle of politics.No matter how popular you are in politics, it's hard to maintain the pace. Boris Johnson won a huge majority just two years ago and was on top of the world. Since then, he has successfully taken the UK out of the European Union - or, to use the phrase Tories like, \"got Brexit done\".But in the past few weeks his popularity has collapsed. His Conservative Party has fallen behind the opposition Labour Party in the opinion polls and his personal approval has plunged. There is now Australian-style discussion about whether the party should choose a new leader.Why has this happened? Well, first there is COVID-19.The government has had to focus on that for the best part of two years. It hasn't done a bad job. Its rollout of vaccines has been close to the fastest of any country in the world, and now the rollout of booster jabs is running apace.The government has tried to balance the crackdown on civil liberties with Johnson's understandable commitment to his libertarian principles. It's been, and it still is, hard to get the balance right, and it's not that which is responsible for his sudden decline in popularity.The PM's biggest problem is that the Conservative base is losing faith in him. For any politician, losing the enthusiasm of the base voters is very damaging, if not fatal. It happened to Malcolm Fraser during the early 1980s when the Liberal Party base lost faith in him.There are three reasons British conservatives have lost their enthusiasm for Boris.First, he introduced financial measures a few months ago that included an increase in taxation. People vote for conservatives because they believe in low tax and small government. COVID-19 measures have led to huge increases in government outlays, and they must be paid for.The higher taxes were a breach of faith with the party's base, no matter how necessary the associated increases in COVID-19-related spending were. While the media were happy enough with the measures the government took, Conservative voters were not.Second, Boris put a huge effort into COP26. He has made addressing climate change one of the central features of his government. They are banning petrol and diesel cars from 2030, meaning new cars will have to be electric.At the moment, electric cars are substantially more expensive than the alternative. Making people pay much more for motoring on top of an increase in taxes has not gone down well with the base.People may find it appealing to hear the government is committed to reducing CO2 emissions, but if the price is several thousand pounds a year then people are not keen to pay that, particularly as it's not clear what contribution that will make to reducing global emissions and increases in global temperature.Third, Johnson's government has been embroiled in a series of relatively minor scandals that have annoyed the public. Not least has been the revelation that staff in Downing Street allegedly broke the rigorous lockdown rules last year by having Christmas drinks together.These three problems have one other aspect to them, which is that Johnson since the 2019 election has had to weather the ire of an establishment that opposed Brexit and remains bitter until now about his role in taking Britain out of the European Union. Those people, be they in the media or other influential sections of society, are now turning on him with a viciousness seldom seen in British politics for many years.This isn't to say the Conservative Party is about to get rid of Johnson. It is not. The government still has three years left of its term, and the party will stick with him for the time being even though it is already beginning the process of thinking about who could possibly replace him.Not that the Conservatives have any obvious alternatives at the moment, and no one is trailing their coat too vigorously at this stage as an alternative later.So expect Johnson to remain PM for some time to come, if not until the next general election - and he may very well last until then, if not beyond.But there is a lesson in all of this, particularly for conservative governments. That lesson is to maintain the support of the party base. It is critically important for all governments to have the support and enthusiasm of the people who brought them to power in the first place. And no wise leader will ever take their supporters for granted.History is replete with examples of leaders who have lost their base. George H.W. Bush lost the support of Republicans when he, like Johnson, increased taxes in his notorious \"read my lips\" about-turn.Fraser's political crime was the introduction of retrospective taxes that alienated Liberal voters in many parts of Australia. By contrast, leaders such as John Howard and Margaret Thatcher maintained the support for more than a decade by always listening to their base, understanding their base, and making it clear they were there for them.Turnbull didn't lose the leadership of the Liberal Party because of his economic management but because he lost contact with the base of the party in Australia.There's a lesson in all of this for Scott Morrison. His base is happy enough with him at the moment, but between now and polling day he needs to make them really excited again by coming up with a truly conservative program for the next parliament.Alexander Downer was Australia's longest serving foreign minister, from 1996 to 2007, and most recently Australian high commissioner to the UK."
