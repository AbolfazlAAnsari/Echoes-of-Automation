The lack of bank accounts means the most vulnerable New Yorkers -- including undocumented immigrants and individuals with experience in the criminal justice system -- are forced to turn to check cashing and other alternative financial services, like payday lending, which often charge high interest rates and have unfair terms of repayment, that leave them in a growing and unending cycle of debt. Households that rely on such services can pay over $600 a year just to cash checks. That's not a sustainable foundation for a broad-based recovery.Still, a public bank shouldn't be the only place vulnerable New Yorkers can gain access to a legitimate bank account or financial services. That's why US Representative Ritchie Torres of the Bronx and I recently called for financial institutions to stop denying immigrants and other vulnerable populations the opportunity to sign up for their offerings.Taken together, I believe a basic income program and a public bank are essential ingredients for New York and other cities to recover quickly and equitably.But cities cannot be solely responsible for pursuing an anti-poverty agenda. During a time of severe budget restraints, we need the federal government to be a partner as well.Most importantly, President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris must continue pursuing a rapid acceleration of vaccine distribution so that New York and other cities can ramp up inoculations, especially in communities of color. Any recovery hinges on near-universal inoculations.And of course, we also need Congress to pass President Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan to help struggling Americans, businesses and state and municipal budgets.I have no doubt New York and other cities will continue to be the bedrock of America's economy. That means the mayors of our country's urban areas have to set the tone for what our economic priorities will be. Cash relief and establishing a public bank are a great place to start.TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved."
