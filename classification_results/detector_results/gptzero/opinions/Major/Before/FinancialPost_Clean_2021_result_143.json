            "inputText": "By Dr. Harry RakowskiCountries led by undemocratic leaders fear free speech the most because it undermines the falsehoods they promote and the corruption best kept hidden in order to prop up their governments. In Russia, Alexei Navalny is jailed for unmasking the riches that Vladimir Putin has assembled. In China, internet access is controlled lest the \"wrong\" - that is the truthful - message can be heard on a broad scale. In Hong Kong, guaranteed freedoms disappear, critics are silenced and the opposition newspaper is closed so that only the party line can be voiced.Western countries greatly value freedom of speech and the freedom to voice unpopular opinions as a key element of a functioning democracy. Their judicial systems vigorously uphold that right. Yet more and more we are seeing an erosion of free speech when an opinion goes against popular belief and thus needs to be censored. Censorship is deemed necessary when ideas are thought to possibly harm societal norms or don't fit our supposed truths. On the surface it sounds reasonable but on deeper reflection it isn't. It leads to even greater societal polarization and distrust of authority. Institutions are allowed to deceive, but individuals need to maintain a higher standard and be silenced.Governments regularly cover up mistakes to avoid public embarrassment. Our current government is in breach of Parliament for heavily redacting documents that detail why two Chinese scientists were fired from a Winnipeg virology lab. The argument that the truth would somehow harm national security smells like the same argument unsuccessfully used by Richard Nixon to deny access to his self-incriminating Watergate tapes.The Catholic church has long hidden the shameful sexual abuse by priests. Now even a highly compassionate and respected pope seems unable to fully acknowledge the role played by the church in the tragedy of abuse and death that occurred in residential homes for Indigenous children.Large corporations have successfully avoided paying their fair share of taxes. Donald Trump's organization is under indictment for tax fraud. The tobacco industry has a history of denying the undeniable link of smoking to cancer and heart disease.I have been sent a number of articles and videos that challenge the conventional wisdom about the effects of COVID-19, the need for masks and the wisdom of vaccination. Some postulate a conspiracy by the ruling class, Bill Gates and Big Pharma to purposefully deceive the public for their own gain. Some authors are convinced that Anthony Fauci caused the pandemic by his agency funding viral research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.Harry Rakowski: Delaying second shot of COVID-19 vaccine dangerous for those at high risk(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/harry-rakowski-delaying-second-shot-of-covid-19-vaccine-dangerous-for-those-at-high-risk)Harry Rakowski: Simple blood test detects clotting from AstraZeneca vaccine early enough to treat(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/harry-rakowski-no-such-thing-as-an-inferior-vaccine)The best lies take an element of truth and distort it to make their point of view more believable. The conspiracies promoted build on our growing mistrust of authority and the deceptions that have occurred in the past.COVID-19 isn't just the flu. The millions of people worldwide who have died due to becoming infected is a truth that cannot be ignored. The tremendous reduction in case counts, hospitalization and death rates due to vaccination is undeniable. The risks of the ever growing impact of the Delta variant is cause for ongoing concern and creates urgent need for overcoming vaccine hesitancy.Given these facts and the risks of ignoring them, how should we deal with those who deny them in print, blogs and social media? Should we still their voices for the public good? Many advocates of these theories appear to be highly qualified and intelligent, perhaps making their distortion of the facts more compelling and thus more dangerous.Freedom of speech is protected under the First Amendment in the U.S. and by Section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. There are however notable exceptions to this protection. In the U.S., obscenity, hate speech, defamation, fraud and incitement are exceptions that have narrow and careful limitations so that free speech remains protected. In Canada the government is also allowed to enforce similar narrowly defined exceptions to free speech protected by Section 2 of the Charter.It is tempting to say that the danger caused by those opposing vaccination, or exaggerating its short- and long-term risks, meets the standards for exceptions to free speech and thus should be banned. It may be of short-term benefit but long-term harm.Banning unpopular speech simply drives it underground to websites that feed into the belief that censorship of ideas is rampant and is the result of biased government and inappropriate regulation. It increases the current worrisome polarization of thought and cancelling of those with unpopular ideas. It increases the militancy of those denied a voice.There are also times when banned or ridiculed speech turns out to be true. COVID-19 may have started as a lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Such opinion was at risk of being banned.Democracy is about allowing ideas to be discussed and debated. We have to trust that most people can understand the facts and come to a sensible conclusion. Open discussion fosters trust and the confirmation that we are free to speak our minds, even if not always correct or politically correct.Free speech isn't free. It comes with a price. People may accept untruths that can harm them or society. However cancelling free speech has a higher price. It is another step down a slippery slope to autocracy that is even more dangerous. Einstein said, \"Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.\" We have to accept that while most bad ideas are wrong, we can't stifle the creativity and unconventional thinking that uncovers great ideas.
