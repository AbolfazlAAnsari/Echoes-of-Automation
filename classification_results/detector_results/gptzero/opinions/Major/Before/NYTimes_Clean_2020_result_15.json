This year, the Times’s editorial board — a group of opinion journalists and editors separate from The Times’s op-ed columnists — broke from convention by endorsing two of them: Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. This week on “The Argument,” Katie Kingsbury, who oversees the editorial board, defends the board’s decision and discusses the role of newspaper endorsements in the Twitter age.Katie says the circumstances created by Trump’s election provided an opportunity for the editorial board to frame Democrats’ choice rather than making it for them. Ross Douthat thinks that endorsing one candidate from the Democratic Party’s moderate lane and another from its progressive wing fails voters who are struggling to pick between the two. The endorsement editorial was unnecessarily harsh toward both Warren and Bernie Sanders, argues Michelle Goldberg. And David Leonhardt makes the case for Bernie Sanders as a candidate who fulfills the board’s desire to endorse someone who represents a break from the political status quo.Then, David pitches his colleagues on an unorthodox thought experiment meant to help deflate America’s partisan tensions.Background Reading:•Ross onWarren’s Native American heritage fiasco•Michelle onthe case for Warrenandwhy it’s hard to break from one’s political allies•David onKlobuchar’s electability case,how the media’s centrist bias hurts Warren and Bernie SandersandSanders’s plausible path to the nomination•The Times editorial board:Warren’s interview with the board;Klobuchar’s interview with the board;the editorial board’s dual endorsement;a special episodeof The Times’s television show, “The Weekly,” featuring the board’s decision;“The Choice” podcastRoss onWarren’s Native American heritage fiascoMichelle onthe case for Warrenandwhy it’s hard to break from one’s political alliesDavid onKlobuchar’s electability case,how the media’s centrist bias hurts Warren and Bernie SandersandSanders’s plausible path to the nominationThe Times editorial board:Warren’s interview with the board;Klobuchar’s interview with the board;the editorial board’s dual endorsement;a special episodeof The Times’s television show, “The Weekly,” featuring the board’s decision;“The Choice” podcastMeet the HostsRoss DouthatI’ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I’m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I’m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the “reasonable” elites. I’ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I’m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.Michelle GoldbergI’ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use “liberal” as an epithet, but that’s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump’s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I’ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian émigré who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.David LeonhardtI’ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago — first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I’ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at Businessweek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I’m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today’s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges — inequality, climate change, the rise of China — and they’ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.How do I listen?Tune in oniTunes,Google Play,Spotify,Stitcheror wherever you listen to podcasts.
