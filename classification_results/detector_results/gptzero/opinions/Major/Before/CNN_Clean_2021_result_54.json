The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.(CNN) --  In a precision operation early Monday, Myanmar's armed forces chief Gen. Min Aung Hlaing summarily deposed the country's government, arresting state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and dozens of other key officials. The military blocked roads in the capital Naypyidaw and Rangoon, disrupted television, telephone and internet service and imposed a curfew.Later, it declared a one-year state of emergency, claiming it would then hold new elections and hand over power to the winner. The coup was staged hours before the country's Parliament was set to meet for its first session since Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won a landslide 83% of the seats in elections last November. The Parliament was expected to approve the election results and install the next government.It wasn't supposed to be this way. In late 2010, Myanmar's military junta began opening to the outside world by releasing then democracy icon Suu Kyi, who had spent some 15 years under house arrest.Five years later, the country held its first democratic elections in 25 years and her party won a historic majority. Despite the military controlling all matters of defense and security, it permitted the transfer to civilian rule, and the world cheered the transition from autocracy to democracy for this southeast Asian nation of some 57 million.Yet it was never that simple.In reality, the country's Constitution had been written by the junta to maintain its grip on power.

Despite her wide parliamentary majority, laws that restricted free speech and assembly were never abolished. She defended the prosecution and imprisonment of journalists who reported on the military's persecution of the Rohingya.She took no action to help three ethnic Kachin activists found guilty and sentenced to prison for defaming the military. And she did nothing to disrupt the incredibly profitable business activities of the military owned conglomerates.It had been the conventional wisdom, until now, that Suu Kyi's support meant the military had no need to conduct a coup.
