And yet, more atrocities emerge -- prompting thepredictable narrative of outrage from Western leadersthat stops short of providing Ukraine with what it needs to bring to an end Putin's savagery.It is worth repeating that Ukrainianshave been living with hybrid warsince 2014, when Russia illegally annexed Crimea and invaded the Donbas with heavily-armed separatists. Some Ukrainians tell me they are not surprised by what the Russians are capable of.Over the course of 2014 and 2015, I saw with my own eyes the evidence of Russian brutality -- villages completely ransacked, schools and cultural and religious complexes destroyed. The corpses of entire families lying in the fields of Donetsk after the MH17 airliner was struck by a Russian BUK missile on July 17, 2014 was a sickening scene eternally etched in my mind.But each of Putin's escalations that are not met by direct Western force only serves to embolden him further. Sanctions are clearly not effective. Will it take the complete annihilation of Ukraine before Western leaders finally say enough is enough and take direct action?In the meantime we are left with half measures, with the Biden administration stopping short of giving Ukraine the weaponry it needs. (The White House says the US and NATO are providing Kyiv with weapons at a historic pace). It may be \"historic,\" but has failed to knock Putin off course.As the West dithers on where to draw its own red lines when it comes to Russian atrocities in Ukraine, a behind-the-scenes geopolitical ballet is playing out between Ukraine and likeminded neighbors working out their own micro alliances and military deals.Expect to see Kyiv forge arrangements with neighboring NATO members and potential members who legitimately see themselves in the crosshairs of Putin's missile launchers. Slovakia, for example,is reported to be preparingto transfer key Soviet-era missile defense systems to Ukraine with the expectation that its stock will be backfilled by western partners. Why this has not been done earlier by the US and its allies is difficult to comprehend.For now, it appears that Russia is refocusing its efforts on expanding its footprint in the Donbas, by taking over the government-controlled eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk.Massive efforts will be expended to further secure the coveted land corridor linking mainland Russia with occupied Crimea. Part of that latter effort will be to flush the despised far-rightAzov Battalionout of the besieged city of Mariupol, mostly by flattening it with unrelenting bombardment.Some pundits have suggested that Putin is aimingto achieve measurable gainsin Ukraine in time for the May 9 Victory Day parade in Moscow. The thought of countless lives being slaughtered so Putin can make his deadline is almost too grotesque to contemplate.In the meantime, Ukrainians will likely tire of waiting to see where the West's red lines are when it comes to brutality in this war. While the United Kingdom said that the use of chemical weapons by the Russian side will mean \"all options are on the table,\" that type of language is beginning to be taken here as little more than virtue signaling.It's time for world leaders posing for selfies with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, to back up the photo ops with real action against Putin's killing machine.Opinion by Michael BociurkiwTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
