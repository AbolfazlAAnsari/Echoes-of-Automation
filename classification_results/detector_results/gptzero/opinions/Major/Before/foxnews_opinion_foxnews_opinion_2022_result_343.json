That demands a change in strategy, or, at the very least, the clarification of our strategy.The New York TimesÂ Editorial Board â a voice that is rarely and reluctantly critical of President Joe Biden â wrote in May about our $40 billion emergency aid package to Ukraine and the likelihood thatRussia would threaten to use nuclearweapons. \"These are extraordinary costs and serious dangers,\" the editorial board wrote. \"And yet there are many questions that President Biden has yet to answer for the American public with regard to the continued involvement of the United States in this conflict.\"Fast forward five months, when the costs are higher and the dangers even more serious. Still, these pressing questions for Biden remain unanswered.Zelenskyy recently said that Ukraine would recapture Crimea by any means necessary. But itâs important to note that Crimea â which has been recognized by Russia as part of Russia since 2014 â has far more historical and cultural ties to Russia than it does to Ukraine. Putin would undoubtedly view offensive action in Crimea as an act of war in Russian territory.Do we share that goal with Zelenskyy? If so,Biden needs to explainto the American people why itâs necessary to commit tens of billions more in direct economic and military assistance. More, he needs to brace the American people for a long and bloody affair in which itâs not just possible, but likely that we will see direct American and NATO involvement. Putin simply will not lose Crimea without expanding the war.If the American people appear reluctant to make such a commitment, maybe itâs because weâre still dealing with the consequences of a long, costly conflict in Afghanistan during which, under this presidentâs leadership, we experienced one of the most humiliating withdrawals in American history.Or is our goal to help Ukraine recapture its pre-February territory? If so, we must recognize two realities. First, even this more limited goal will prove to be a long and violent undertaking. And second, a protracted effort to expel all Russian forces from Eastern Ukraine will still increase the likelihood of the U.S. being drawn into direct conflict with Russia.Putinâs reign â and ego â can survive a botched war, but not an utter humiliation by Zelenskyy and the United States. Weâre already seeing signs of his desperation, as he recently mobilized an additional 300,000 troops and made another nuclear threat.Russian President Vladimir Putin's annexation of eastern Ukraine raises questions about how the war can end.(Shutterstock)Itâs clear that his escalation is a sign of weakness, not strength. But an animal is most dangerous when itâs injured and backed into a corner â his threats must be taken seriously.The bottom line, though, is that Americaâs role in this war is far too ambiguous. There has been too much time passed and money spent for our mission to remain unclear. For Biden to leave so many questions unanswered â and for Congress to approve billions of additional taxpayer dollars while they remain unanswered â is a disservice to the people of both Ukraine and the United States.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.
