            "inputText": "My latest home insurance renewal policy raised our household premium by 11.6 per cent. Why, I wondered, since we hadn't made any claims.The cover letter stated: \"The increased cost of repairs and increased occurrence of severe weather and natural disasters in Ontario have affected your premium. Due to inflation, the cost of building materials has increased, meaning that the cost to repair and rebuild your home in the event of a claim has increased. Significant weather events such as ice storms, high winds and heavy rainfall, as well as the increase in frequency and severity of natural disasters such as fires and floods have affected the cost of home insurance in Ontario.\"Despite having been in my almost continuously locked-down province for the past year, I obviously missed all the \"disasters\" and the \"occurrence of severe weather\" the letter alluded to. The same insurance company, owned by TD Bank, also recently renewed our automobile insurance but the rate only increased 3.2 per cent - perhaps because they recognized we weren't allowed to travel except to stock up on \"essentials.\" And TD Bank itself had sent a notice it was increasing some banking charges on my account. The price went up for all the services I obtain from them but there was no change in what they pay in interest for funds I might occasionally have on deposit.If you wanted to give TD the benefit of the doubt, you might suppose the banks and insurance companies had suffered from the lockdowns so these increased fees and charges would ensure they retained their employees through the same travails as the rest of the population have experienced.But then Thursday, May 27, arrived and the FP reported(https://financialpost.com/fp-finance/banking/canadas-three-big-banks-beat-profit-expectations-on-lower-provisions): \"Three of Canada's top lenders reported better-than-expected quarterly profits on Thursday.\" The three were RBC, CIBC and TD. Though earnings climbed for RBC and CIBC they actually fell for TD. Excluding the impact of provisions and taxes, they fell 16.8 per cent, compared with increases of 14 per cent and 11 per cent at CIBC and RBC, respectively. In other words, had provisions for loan losses at TD not resulted in a substantial recovery of $373 million of funds set aside to cover bad loans, and had taxes not been lower, their results would not have been nearly as impressive. But they were.For more detail, I checked out the TD \"Quarterly Results Presentation(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/793/70793/original.pdf)\" that accompanied the announcement. At 36 pages, it contained lots of details. For instance, on page nine it stated; \"Insurance claims were down 34 per cent YoY (year-over-year) and down 43 per cent QoQ (quarter-over-quarter).\" That's right: 34 per cent down and 43 per cent down yet both of our insurance premiums increased!On page four of the presentation, describing TD's \"Proven Business Model,\" one of six bullets was: \"Continued strong Wealth, Insurance and Wholesale earnings.\" Yes, \"strong\" insurance earnings. But despite these \"strong\" earnings they want more. That does explain why our premiums went up. But it has nothing to do with what they said in the cover sent with the policy renewal.TD CEO Bharat Masrani's earnings-call remarks(https://seekingalpha.com/article/4431798-toronto-dominion-banks-td-ceo-bharat-masrani-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript?mail_subject=td-the-toronto-dominion-bank-s-td-ceo-bharat-masrani-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript&;utm_campaign=rta-stock-article&;utm_content=link-0&;utm_medium=email&;utm_source=seeking_alpha) include his bragging about issues that have nothing to do with what would once have been considered \"normal\" management issues for a financial institution. For example, TD is committed to ESG (environment, social, governance) and Masrani notes that recovery from the pandemic: \"was a core message of our 2020 ESG(https://www.td.com/document/PDF/ESG/2020-ESG-Report.pdf) and TCFD(https://www.td.com/document/PDF/ESG/2020-TCFD-Report.pdf) (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) reports, which we released this quarter.\"He went on to say: \"I invite you to read them and learn more about what we are doing to build a more inclusive and sustainable future. That includes our approach to achieving the goals of our climate action plan, as the first Canadian bank to set a net-zero target by 2050. We are accelerating our efforts, have mobilized leaders and experts across the bank. And are working closely with clients in multiple sectors to support their transition plans and create positive change.\" That must all be very expensive.

Somebody has to pay for all this social activism.
