They even banned most vehicular pursuits, which means criminals can quite literally drive off from the scene of most crimes without fear that they’ll be chased and detained. Cities like Seattle went one step further, banning most traffic stops altogether.The use-of-force bill was somewhat fixed this last legislative session to allow police use force if a suspect flees the scene of a crime. But the standard is still probable cause -- much higher than reasonable suspicion.WASHINGTON SWAT DEPUTY SHOT IN LINE OF DUTY HAS DIEDThis matters because criminals know these new laws work in their favor and they’re taking advantage.Smash and grabs continue to wreak havoc. Crooks break into various retail stores, usually driving a car (but sometimes a forklift) into a storefront, before physically removing the ATM. Due to the cash-only nature of pot shops, they are also being targeted, with some 200 robberies this year and many of them are armed.FILE – Seattle police respond to the area of Third Avenue and Pine Street after a fatal shooting.(Seattle Police Department)In many of the cities where this is occurring, especially Seattle, police are so understaffed they can’t arrive in time to catch the criminals. If they arrive as the thieves drive off, they wouldn’t likely have probable cause that a violent crime occurred and would be barred from pursuit.If the new \"police accountability\" laws weren’t bad enough, we have politicians and judges who treat criminals like the victims.According to a leaked draft ordinance, the King County Council is considering legislation mandating police connect a suspect with a public defender before they can consent to a search of their person or property. The suspect can’t even waive their rights -- they must first speak with a lawyer. This effectively stops most police investigations, while hampering them with extra work.FILE -- SEPT 1, 2021: Seattle Police respond to a third shooting incident Tuesday evening in the 200 block of Yesler Way in the Pioneer Square neighborhood.(Seattle Police Department)When the suspects are teens, there’s almost never juvenile detention thanks to left wing judges. Perhaps that’s behind the rash of teen criminals endangering the lives of residents? They know they won’t be punished seriously.Four kids between the ages of 11 and 16 were arrested after a recent drive-by shooting on I-5 in Pierce County. A group of teens as young as 14, one armed with a gun, carjacked a victim in Burien, Wash. four days later. The suspects in a Tacoma pot shop murder are 15 and 16. They had just been previously placed on home arrest following charges connected to a violent armed robbery that included an alleged pistol-whipping.When some mayors objected to the soft-on-violent-crime approach to juvenile suspects, a King County prosecutor told them to \"get used to it.\" This is the new reality.Anyone even casually reviewing the new laws, the defunded and understaffed police departments, and soft-on-crime judges and prosecutors would be able to connect the dots. But with woke, one-party rule in Washington, we get little more than lip service that barely even acknowledges the crisis.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JASON RANTZJason Rantz, author of \"What’s Killing America: Inside the Radical Left’s Tragic Destruction of Our Cities,\" is a Seattle-based talk show host on KTTH Radio.
