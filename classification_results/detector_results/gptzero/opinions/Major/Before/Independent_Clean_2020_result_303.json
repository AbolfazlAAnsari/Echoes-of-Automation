Science will finally defeat the virus, as polio, smallpox, etc have been, but only if we do our bit, which is to adhere to the rules.Keith PooleBasingstokeSovereignty in the 21st centuryThe good news is that Michel Barnier is still in London to leave the door open for our reluctant negotiators to find a deal. The bad news is that David Frost, Michael Gove and the rest are still going on about \"respecting UK sovereignty\". What they don't understand is that sovereignty in the interconnected world of 21st century partnerships is not the same as it was in the 19th century when half the world map was coloured pink.They may hate the idea of the ECJ, but because of our continuing membership of other organisations, we will have no greater \"sovereignty\". The UN, WTO, WHO, Nato and others all require concessions in exchange for the benefits and influence gained from membership, and the EU is the same; we benefited handsomely for 47 years from it. Meanwhile for 70 years, US service personnel have been stationed in the UK subject only to their own laws; I'm sure Harry Dunn's parents have a view on the integrity of UK sovereignty in this matter.It is critical that Johnson finds some way out of this mess. Sovereignty is worth nothing without global credibility, so he must accept the Lords' verdict ('Boris Johnson on Brexit collision course with Joe Biden after House of Lords defeat', 9 November) and abandon his attempt to overrule the withdrawal agreement. That will then allow an agreement on the flow of goods and services between UK and our biggest trading partner without new mountains of red tape and cost for zero added value over imports and exports. It might also head off considerations of longer-term strategic relocations of jobs and skills out of the UK and back into the EU.For \"Global Britain\" to have a chance it must have a smooth and efficient trade deal with its biggest trading partner, and it needs it now.Charles WoodBirminghamRead MoreKey battle opens up in Armenia-Azerbaijan warArmenia asks Moscow for help amid Nagorno-Karabakh fighting"
