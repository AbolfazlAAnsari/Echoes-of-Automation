An east coast hub with two terminals - the other in Nova Scotia - could replace a sizeable portion of Russia's supply.Canada's second challenge is the reputation of our energy industry in Europe where it's commonly dismissed as \"tar sands\" and where divestment from Canadian oil and gas companies is almost a done deal. Canada has work to do here too.The CEOs of Canada's six largest oil sands companies - responsible for about 95 per cent of production - are reportedly working together(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-oil-sands-ceos-are-working-together-in-the-race-to-get-to-net-zero/) to achieve net zero by 2050. But why wait that long?Peter Tertzakian: The dream of cheap, clean, safe and secure energy is being put on hold(https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/peter-tertzakian-the-dream-of-cheap-clean-safe-and-secure-energy-is-being-put-on-hold)Brent at $113, WTI at $109 - oil prices are spiking this morning as traders scramble to find alternative sources(https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/oil-spikes-as-russian-supply-concerns-increase-amid-sanctions-2)'Finish the symbolic move, go all the way': Canada's ban on Russian crude oil will be expanded(https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/finish-the-symbolic-move-go-all-the-way-canadas-ban-on-russian-crude-oil-could-be-expanded)Canadian energy companies are enjoying the benefits of unexpectedly high oil and gas prices at the moment. The estimated cost to reach net zero for the six largest oil sand producers is $75 billion over 30 years, $2.5 billion per year. For CNRL and Suncor, the two biggest producers, the annual cost is about $760 million for each.But rather than investing it all back into technology such as carbon capture and storage that would curtail our greenhouse gas emissions, energy companies are instead buying back their stocks. CNRL announced its latest stock buyback program in March 2021. It can still buy back about 37.8 million shares, worth about $2.6 billion. In February 2022, Suncor announced a stock buyback program for 4.99 per cent of its stock. The estimated cost is about $2.7 billion.This is looking like a missed opportunity to send the world a clear signal about Canada's commitment to net-zero. Accelerated investments now could help Canada get to net zero well before 2050.European countries, especially Germany, are too dependent on Russian oil and gas and it is a major geopolitical risk for Europe. It hinders the continent's response to the invasion of Ukraine and other unforeseen risks in future years. Even though oil from Alberta cannot directly reach Europe, better access to world markets through the Trans Mountain Pipeline would increase price stability and help Europe indirectly. High oil and gas prices are financing Russian aggression and the war effort as Europe is giving Russia the financial resources to wage war on Ukraine.In the long-term, Canada can - and should - be a responsible global energy leader that provides clean energy with net-zero emissions from a democratic and reliable country.
