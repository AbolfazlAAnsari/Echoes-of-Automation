However, in another person's opinion, the EU is democratic because all regulations are approved by the elected European parliament and member state governments, who are in turn scrutinised by their national assemblies.Brexit was a unique experiment that allowed us to apply scientific methods to questions that were once merely a matter of opinion. During the referendum, it was predicted that we would abolish a large number of EU regulations, and negotiate a better deal in terms of fishing arrangements.The Brexit experiment has now been running for more than five years and it is time to compare actual results with predictions. There has not been a wide-scale abolition of regulations and the fishing arrangements are not better than before.Hence, the Brexiteers have not been able to scientifically prove that the EU is undemocratic, even though it was their experiment and they were given all available resources.Panos GregoryLondonDraconian measures to crack down on protestsIf the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APPC) feels that changing the rules on holding demonstrations are not needed, they should speak out firmly. Their chair, Paddy Tipping, thinks decisions on policing demos should be left to the local police, not the Home Office.The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill proposes draconian measures in a so-called democracy, that sound like the policing methods in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia where people get hurt and youngsters are detained for protesting. It will be used to curtail freedom of speech.If people have an issue, they will come out and march. The Home Office \"deciding\" who can march will alienate citizens further. MPs should review this bill.Janet SalmonRichmondBiodegradable plastic filmKate Hughes is rightto highlight the confusion about biodegradableplastics, so some clarification is required.Oil-based plastic films cannot be degraded by microorganisms. In contrast, plastic plant-based films classified as compostable break down in contact with the soil, in a low temperature rotting process. It takes six to eight months in my garden composter.Materials classified as biodegradable need to be treated in an industrial composting process, with temperatures rising to 70C. The result is a compost crumb structure, suitable for spreading on land as a fertiliser. They may or may not decompose at lower temperatures.To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter byclicking hereOxy, oil-based plastic materials, have a light-sensitive chemical in them, causing the film to break into small fragments of material, which will not degrade.For compostable or biodegradable films to break down, the microbes need a blended mix of protein, minerals, carbohydrates, air and moisture.As compostable films become the norm for food packaging, more attention must be paid to ensure the compost caddy contains a waste mixture that suits microorganisms' digestive needs. If plant-based and oil-based films are not clearly differentiated, the default action must be to put the film in the residual waste bin.When we realise that plant-based films are not only plastic substitutes but are in fact food, we can start sending the material to anaerobic digesters to produce biogas to substitute for CO2-producing natural gas.Bob PringleAberdeenRead MoreLetters: A plant-based diet is the only way to end cruelty to animalsLetters: Boris Johnson's childish strategy of shouting at the French is pointlessLetters: The answer to our staff shortages could be sitting in tents in CalaisLetters: A plant-based diet is the only way to end cruelty to animalsLetters: Boris Johnson's childish strategy of shouting at the French is pointlessLetters: The answer to our staff shortages could be sitting in tents in Calais"
