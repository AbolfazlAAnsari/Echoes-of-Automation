I do not owe him a thing. If there is corruption [related to Brown], it will be prosecuted.”So, Harris moved on. She became District Attorney in San Francisco with the help of Brown (well before her harsh comments above) and other Democratic Party mainstays like Senator Dianne Feinstein.From there, Harris ran for California State Attorney General all but unopposed as the California Democratic Party Establishment cleared the way for her.She then worked out a deal with former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom that cleared the way for her to be the Democratic Party favorite for the open Senate seat in 2016 while Newsom would become governor.So, what did she do when she got to the Senate?
