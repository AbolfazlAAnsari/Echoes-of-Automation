There was no communication from the carrier, no representative at the airport anywhere. Queues of people at the departure gate around 9pm, no desk attendant in sight.We got on the plane, and heard: \"Sorry for the delay, we couldn't get enough crew. Would you like some peanuts and water to make up for it?\" Well, I suppose we will.We arrive at 1am local time in Mallorca. Expected time was 8.30pm. Consequently, there was no transfer bus available. We waited another hour for a bus to be sorted and then to leave. It went round most of the island before dropping us off with our two exhausted kids at around 4am. We were told: \"Your hotel is just up there. Bye, bye. It's not a long walk from the main road.\"I contacted the travel company the next day by chat. No apology - and when I mentioned our difficulties, she just left the chat without a goodbye.Appalling, traumatic experience: I'm not sure how it's possible to treat people like this. Our next holiday will likely be spent on the Costa del Inglaterra.Nick JAddress suppliedThe Queen's jubileeVarious media have noted how much change the Queen has experienced throughout her life - not that I see quite what achievement that is.Millions have lived through periods of rapid change, but the big difference is that they've been hugely more impacted by it than members of the royal family.Dr Anthony IngletonSheffieldBack to the wallAs the Tory backbench letters of no confidence inBoris Johnsonbegin to mount towards the critical threshold, the passing ofthe Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Actearlier this year may now present a perilous obstacle to removing him.To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter byclicking hereBy abandoning fixed-term parliaments, the House of Commons has effectively returned a principal power of the royal prerogative back to the prime minister.At his discretion, Johnson can advise the sovereign when to dissolve parliament and call a general election. While convention would assume that he has the assent of his cabinet and wider party to do this, there are precedents where no such assent was sought or desired - as surprise was often regarded as a distinct advantage to the incumbent.With Johnson's back to the wall and his loyalty to the Tory party or indeed any party seemingly secondary to his own interests and self-preservation, there is no guarantee that he would not rule out taking the Tories down with him, by calling a bruising general election should any coup to oust him look likely to succeed.Paul DolanCheshire"
