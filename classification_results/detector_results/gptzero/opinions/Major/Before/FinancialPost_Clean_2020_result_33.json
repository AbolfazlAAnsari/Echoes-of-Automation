And it is clear that one of the places where they will be most needed is Africa.A mock-up of a portable ICU unit.That continent is home to 1.2 billion people, but has very few ventilators, or the infrastructure they require. For example, Kenya has 50 million people and 200 supported ventilators. Nigeria has 350 ventilators for 200 million people. For comparison, in the United States, there are 340 fully equipped ICU beds for every million people, with at least 50 per cent more ventilators in reserve. Despite the great need for ventilators, sending them without the infrastructure they require would be like sending bicycle frames without wheels.Yet if we distributed two additional life-support systems to every existing ICU-enabled bed in Africa, it would immediately triple the continent's high-end ICU capacity. The percentage of people saved will be small - even 1,000 ventilators divided among 1.2 billion people is a drop in the ocean - but the absolute number of lives saved could be large. Best of all, the newly installed critical care infrastructure would continue to save lives well after COVID-19 passes.National PostJoseph A.
