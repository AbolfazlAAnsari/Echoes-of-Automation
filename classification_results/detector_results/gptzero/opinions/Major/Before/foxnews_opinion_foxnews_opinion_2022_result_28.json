More importantly, they lied about President Joe Bidenâs involvement with his sonâs activities.This is not routine political dirty tricks; the Times and other legacy media organizations, as well as Twitter and Facebook, which banned the New York Post and all discussion of the Hunter Biden story, may have changed the outcome of the 2020 election.If there had been open and honest reporting about the damning information contained on that infamous laptop, the authenticity of which has never been denied by either Hunter or his father, Joe Biden might not be president today.In the past few days, the New York Times finally reported on Hunter Bidenâs laptop, 17 months after the New York Post broke the story.Faced with the possibility that Hunter might be indicted for tax fraud or possibly money laundering, the Times probably felt the need to get ahead of the story. How shameful.It wasnât just the liberal media that worked to suppress the truth. Powerful people convinced 51 former intelligence officers to sign a letter suggesting that the revelations of possible corruption on the part of a presidential candidate had all the earmarks of a \"Russian disinformation\" campaign.They would know.Republicans have vowed to dig deeper into Huntergate if they take back control of the House in November. They must do that, but also somehow ensure that a few giant organizations cannot control what Americans see and hear. This is not Russia; censorship is not acceptable.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK"
