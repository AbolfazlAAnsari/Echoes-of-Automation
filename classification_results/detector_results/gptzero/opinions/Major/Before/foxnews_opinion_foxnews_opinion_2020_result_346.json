FRIEDEN AND DOOLEY: CORONAVIRUS SAFETY TIPS — 6 SIMPLE WAYS TO STAY HEALTHYNow that my last child is college-aged, I can tell you this – you are doing great – just R-E-L-A-X!I understand, your stress can be intense.

(By the way, please give teachers grace as they are also navigating a path that is completely foreign to them.)I want to reassure you that it’s okay to let them play. According to an article in Psychology Today, kids can actually entertain themselves. Let them be independent and learn through play. As long as they are safe, this is one of the best ways children learn.It’s also important to know that your high anxiety and stress levels actually impede your child’s ability to learn. So, really, R-E-L-A-X! When a child senses your anxiety, the child is focused more on the fear you are exuding and not on learning.
