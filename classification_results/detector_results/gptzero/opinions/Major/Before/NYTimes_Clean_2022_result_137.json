            "inputText": "Readers react to an essay about praying to a pretend God.Readers react to an essay about praying to a pretend God.To the Editor:Re “Praying to a God You Don’t Believe In,” by Scott Hershovitz (Opinion guest essay, Sunday Review, May 8):I had the requisite bar mitzvah at age 13, and after many years of nonattendance I find myself regularly attending religious services at my local synagogue. I have even been studying the Torah every Shabbat. But still I struggled with accepting the idea of a supreme being that daily is pulling all the strings that determines the behavior of everyone on this planet, particularly when I read the front page of The New York Times or tune in to television network news shows.I am indebted to Mr. Hershovitz, and perhaps even more so to his son Rex, who so cogently said: “God isn’t real. But when we pretend, he is.” I finally have an acceptable explanation of how to believe in God, when I’m not sure I really believe in one.Richard WestonBeverly Hills, Calif.To the Editor:As a rabbi who has primarily served older adults and their families for the past decade, I am often asked “why.” Why does evil exist? Why does God allow my beloved mother/father/spouse/sibling/child to live with relentless pain?Ever since the devil struck a bargain with God to test Job’s faith and he alone suffered the traumatic consequences, the “why” question has never been answered in a way that has emotional integrity or, frankly, offers comfort. I do, however, suggest another framing that places the responsibility upon us.God doesn’t “do.” Human beings “do.” It is our responsibility to act in concert with God, to bring godliness in the world, to be the good that overtakes the evil.If each of us can do just one act to dull the sharp knife of evil, we are doing God’s work. Rex may not believe in God, and sadly evil will always pollute our lives. But Rex can believe in the power of being God’s partner and being the good that we so often are too disheartened to discern.(Rabbi) Reba CarmelCheltenham, Pa.To the Editor:I, too, pray to a God I don’t believe exists. My pretend God loves all people equally, regardless of gender, race or whatever, and wants us to do the same. My pretend God wants us to be humble, selfless, strive for peace and take care of the world so our offspring can enjoy it for hundreds of thousands of years to come.Most important, though, my pretend God wants us to use critical thinking, dialogue and rational argumentation to come to our beliefs and values, rather than blindly and absolutely trust any kind of authority figure, itself included.Bram van HeuvelnTroy, N.Y.To the Editor:This is one of the best explanations that I have read of how “seeking refuge” in religion is one way to help endure life. As a lapsed Catholic and nonbeliever I have avoided Mass, prayer and religion because to participate I would feel like a faker. At the same time over the years I have felt bereft of community. I missed my church. Now at 72 years old maybe I will be able to go back to church without guilt.Patricia SilviaCharlestown, R.I.To the Editor:Maybe “pretend” is perceptive for a 4-year-old mulling over belief in God. However, belief in God actually defies human definition.Belief takes us well beyond the specific doctrine, rules and history of any organized religion. Maybe belief is not meant to be clearly defined, but actually meant to be directional. Our challenge is to believe that following the direction of goodness will lead us and the world toward an unknown destination crafted by an unknowable God.Maybe an interested child would be intrigued hearing that God is unknowable, too big for our small brains. Believing in God isn’t pretending. It is believing in something too big for people to really understand. Like the wind. We can’t see it but we see what it does. Then we think about it.A child has a lifetime ahead to think about God, about big ideas. Tell that little person, what fun, how wonderful, keep thinking.Anita SiegenthalerPort Clyde, MaineTo the Editor:Scott Hershovitz writes: “Millions have died of Covid-19. Authoritarianism is on the rise, abroad and at home. And now there’s war, with all the death, destruction and dislocation that entails.” If God exists, why does all this happen? So the tired old argument goes. It assumes that God does nothing to prevent these horrors, that God does not intervene.Consistently we refuse to listen to the prophets among us, and they are among us. Not those who just predict doom, but the prophets who show us a better way to go. We refuse to accept responsibility for our refusal to listen to those who tell us the truth, the truth that would save millions.So what do we do? Blame God for doing nothing. When in fact it is God who sends us the voices that show us the way out of our messes. God is and always will be our scapegoat. Not only our scapegoat but our rival.Frank SabatteNew YorkThe writer is a Roman Catholic priest.To the Editor:When Rex, Scott Hershovitz’s son, claims that a “pretend God is real,” he is not speaking truth or wisdom. He is speaking a child’s wish that we can make something real simply by believing it. Though this may offer comfort for some, that comfort comes at a steep price.Throughout history broadly held fictions have been responsible for massive human suffering. Consider our countless religious wars, our countless racial wars and the empty promises of politicians who pander to the darker side of our nature. Rejecting easy fictions may be uncomfortable and require us to look cleareyed at human suffering, but that is far better than the alternative.Richard WinchellSt. Charles, Ill.To the Editor:Scott Hershovitz tells the story of his son questioning the existence of God, then goes on to propose a theology in which we know God is not real, but we “pretend” otherwise. This fictionalism suggests that God lives in a fantasy world like Harry Potter at Hogwarts.This may work if you want your religion “inscrutable,” as Mr. Hershovitz does. I prefer my religion intelligible. There is another option besides a supernatural omnipotent “Being” and a fictional character. Instead, we can invite God into the real world of children: Allow them to imagine the Divine like electricity that runs through the wires but is seen only when we flip the switch. In other words, whether God is real depends on us.My grandson informed me just before his bar mitzvah that he wasn’t sure he believed in God. I asked if he could think of a metaphor for God that made sense to him. He said, “God is like the ocean, and I am the wave.” This is the religious imagination that can be cultivated. It’s not magic, but it is magical.Sandy Eisenberg SassoCarmel, Ind.The writer is a rabbi and an author of children’s books on religion and spirituality.To the Editor:It took me longer to discover a truth about God than it took Scott Hershovitz’s then 4-year-old son. Around age 75 it occurred to me that if God exists in the mind of a believer, then He exists. If God doesn’t exist in the mind of a nonbeliever, then He doesn’t. Question of the ages resolved, and we can quit worrying about it.I’ll probably never convince believers, and they will probably never convince me, but in truth it doesn’t matter.James SherryWinchester, Va.To the Editor:Long past my Sunday school days, I’ve come to believe that what we call God is a spirit in the universe, a consciousness that neither manipulates nor judges human activity; humans themselves craft their lives.
