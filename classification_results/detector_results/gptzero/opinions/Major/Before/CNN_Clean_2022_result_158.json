What arguments will work on them in the face of fossil fuel profits, political divisions, the war in Ukraine and so on is an open question. Nancy Pelosirecently dispenseda common bit of rhetoric at the Aspen Ideas: Climate festival when she said that climate action was needed \"for the children.\"The issue: Kids have been pleading with adults to do something about environmental collapse at least since theRio Earth Summitin 1992. Greta Thunberg andmany othersadded to that chorus.\"The [Democratic] party doesn't even seem to realize that it's blowing a once-in-a-decade chance to pass meaningful climate legislation,\" Robinson Meyer wrote inThe Atlantic.So, I don't have a tidy solution for us -- whoever \"us\" is.We've had the science in front of us for decades.We see the disasters. They disproportionately affect the world's mostmarginalized and low-incomepeople, who are less poised to mitigate them and to rebuild. But they also hit the wealthy. Think not just of the mansions in Orange County but of Superstorm Sandy in New York in 2012 and theeroding cliffs of Malibu.None of that, unfortunately, has been persuasive.At least to those with the power to change the global economy.Perhaps a grassroots mobilization of ordinary citizens could change that.The point is that the concerned public must not sit back and wait, as we have been, for the intensifying calamities of the climate crisis to somehow prove that we must rid the world of fossil fuels.We have all the evidence we need.Opinion by John D.
