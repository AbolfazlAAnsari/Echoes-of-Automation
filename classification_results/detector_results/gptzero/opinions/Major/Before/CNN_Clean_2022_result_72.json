If Le Pen does not win this time, she or someone like her will most likely win another time.French Muslims are tired of being pawns in this political game. Muslims comprise an estimated8.8% of the populationof France yet take up almost all of the political and media discourse, while their voices are left out of the conversation.Islam and immigration are topics that the far-right loves to use for their agenda, and unfortunately Macron, and those before him, fell into this trap. If Macron wins, he will have to make amends with thosehe has affected.And he and his administration will have to stop treating their French Muslim citizens as if they were a population that needed to be tamed.There is a need to proactively and constructively engage with Muslims, put in place programs that fight discrimination, and stop weaponizing laicite as a tool for political identity. Muslims are simply not the threat some politicians and pundits make them out to be. France needs to allow Muslims to be full French citizens on their own terms, to express their identities openly and honestly, in a manner that is both true to their faith yet unambiguously French.Whether or not Macron or Le Pen wins this weekend, there is no doubt that the political landscape is shifting under the feet of French voters.Opinion by Rim-Sarah AlouaneTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
