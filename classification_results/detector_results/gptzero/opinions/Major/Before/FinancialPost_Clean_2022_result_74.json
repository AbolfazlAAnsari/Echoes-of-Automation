            "inputText": "The federal government recently announced it will be seeking comments from the public regarding its newly proposed \"Tax-Free First Home Savings Account\"(https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2022/08/design-of-the-tax-free-first-home-savings-account.html) (FHSA).The FHSA, which as its name indicates is only for first-time home-buyers, combines the best features of the RRSP and TFSA. It's a registered account, which means investment income earned inside it is tax-free. And it gives twice: contributions will be tax-deductible, like the RRSP, but withdrawals are also tax-free, like the TFSA. The annual contribution limit will be $8,000 and the lifetime contribution limit $40,000.But is the FHSA truly necessary?We already have the RRSP, the TFSA, the RESP, and the RDSP. We also have the CPP, OAS, GIS, RRIFs, CCB, GST credits, and \"climate action incentive tax credits.\" And that's just on the federal level. Every province has its own myriad of benefits and credits to administer as well.How good is Canadians' understanding of all these programs? As a tax accountant on the frontlines of this maddeningly, ever-increasingly complex tax system, my guess is a large majority of Canadians could not accurately describe what they're all for, who is eligible for them, how they interact with each other and how best to use or even access them.So why, in the face of all the complexity that already exists in this system, is the government proposing yet another brand-new registered savings account? We must be living in some sort of Bizarro World or maybe a Matrix-like simulation in which the programmers are playing a cruel, cruel post-modern joke on us. What else could possibly explain this new FHSA?It seems the federal government genuinely wants to help first-time home buyers save up more money to buy a home. What a wonderful idea! If only someone had thought of this before. If only there was a mechanism for first-time home buyers to save money in a registered account with a tax-deductible contribution and a tax-free withdrawal!Oh, wait! There already is!It's called the Home Buyers Plan(https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/what-home-buyers-plan.html) (HBP). It exists within the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). Does the prime minister not know about this? How about the minister of finance? Any other cabinet ministers? Anyone in the Department of Finance? Any of the advisors who work in the PMO?The HBP, which is for first-time home buyers, allows for a tax-free withdrawal from one's RRSP of up to $35,000 towards the purchase of a home. True, it must be repaid back into the RRSP over the next 15 years. If not, the withdrawal will be included in taxable income each year over the next 15 years. But it's like a tax-free loan to oneself. And, of course, the original contributions into the RRSP were tax-deductible.So the basic mechanisms for the FHSA already exist within the RRSP. And let's not forget about the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive(https://www.placetocallhome.ca/fthbi/first-time-homebuyer-incentive), a shared-equity mortgage program in which the government pays five to 10 per cent of the purchase price of your first home in exchange for a share in its appreciation (or depreciation) when you sell it. This program began way back in - well, in 2019, actually, just three years ago - but uptake on this program has been well below(https://financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/cmhc-rewrites-rules-of-homebuyer-shared-equity-program-to-limit-potential-losses-and-gains) expectations and recent changes were required to limit the government's potential losses due to the decrease in the prices of houses.There seems to be a pattern in the decision-making process of this government: Design and announce a new tax incentive or program as quickly as political currents require, without giving much thought to the potential unintended consequences, which can be patched up later, with another new program if need be.Here is what the government should do: Shut down the consultations and scrap this ridiculous FHSA idea. Instead, if Ottawa feels it really must stoke the demand for home ownership, simply increase the amount of the RRSP Home Buyers Plan from $35,000 to $75,000 (an additional $40,000) and declare the Home Buyers Plan withdrawals to be tax-free, with no need for future repayment or income inclusions. Maybe even also allow first-time home-buyers a higher contribution limit into the RRSP by $8,000 per year or $40,000 lifetime.Jack Mintz: Don't add ESG to pension plan woes(https://financialpost.com/opinion/jack-mintz-dont-add-esg-to-pension-plan-woes)Philip Cross: In the war on cars, the suburbs strike back(https://financialpost.com/opinion/philip-cross-in-the-war-on-cars-the-suburbs-strike-back)Franco Terrazzano: Ottawa depending on economic blue skies to balance the budget(https://financialpost.com/opinion/franco-terrazzano-ottawa-depending-on-economic-blue-skies-to-balance-the-budget)This would accomplish exactly the same goal as the FHSA but without the increase in complexity.At bottom, the FHSA is a perfect example of what's wrong with our tax system. Politicians, looking to target a favoured group of voters, create new cockamamie schemes that sound great in a press release and at election time. But these targeted schemes increase complexity, cost, frustration, CRA budgets and add to the nightmare that the Canadian tax system has become.Politicians should instead be asking of every new proposal that comes before them: will this make the tax system simpler or more complex? In the case of the FHSA, the answer is clear: The bizarro world called, they want their first-home savings account back.Neal Winokur is a CPA and author of The Grumpy Accountant(https://grumpyaccountant.ca/ ). !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
