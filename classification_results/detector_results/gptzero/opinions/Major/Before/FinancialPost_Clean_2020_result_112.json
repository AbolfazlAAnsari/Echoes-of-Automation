Students, faculty and Jewish community members have been calling attention to anti-Semitism on campus since the very first anti-Israel meeting was held on a Sunday morning in January 2002.In order to enter the lecture hall on that fateful day, attendees were obligated to sign a declaration agreeing to \"Palestinian resistance by any means.\" To put this into context, \"resistance\" referred to the suicide attacks that were taking place in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem at the time, in a concerted attempt to murder Jews.From there, radicalism spread to thousands of campuses around the world. Anti-Israel students and even faculty spread the biggest lie of this century: that Israel is an apartheid state that is treating Palestinians inhumanely; and like apartheid-era South Africa, Israel deserved to be criminalized, dismantled and destroyed.Over time, that lie was so widely accepted on campus that openly calling for the genocide of the Jewish people became the rallying cry of the pro-Palestinian movement: \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" - effectively meaning the elimination of Israel.Despite our calls for a task force to counter this incessant hate, for decades now, students have graduated with a mistaken view that Israel is singularly evil among nations.

The answer is that the momentum against Israel and the Jewish people is shifting. Every generation of university students needs a cause to fight for. For a time, that cause was anti-Israelism and anti-Semitism. But they are starting to fall out of fashion.This is because of two fundamental factors. First, the changing landscape in the Middle East is making Palestinian propaganda untenable. Secondly, and more fundamentally, is that the growing global acceptance of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism is making it harder for university administrators to turn a blind eye to the hatred that has been brewing on their campuses.The declaration specifically says that those who \"claim that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour\" are anti-Semitic.In August, Florida State University was one of several universities in the United States to adopt the IHRA definition, which showed that university administrators have begun to see the wisdom of having guidelines by which to identify and, hopefully, eliminate hate from their campuses.While some anti-Israel professors and radical student groups have condemned the IHRA definition, claiming that it will chill their speech and punish their ideology, the truth is that it does nothing of the sort.
