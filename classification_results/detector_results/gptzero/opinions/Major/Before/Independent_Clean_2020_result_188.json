Long before the pandemic, the music industry model was broken. For more than two decades at our charity Youth Music, we've witnessed a stifling of young talent as career aspirations are cut short by gender, location, and class discrimination time and time again.This funding provides a sticking plaster but, in this period of economic transition, the music industry must rid itself of its \"old boys club\" to promote diversity and inclusion. We must use the upheaval of 2020 as a springboard to hit reset on the industry and open the doors to more young people, who will need all the support they can get.This is why Youth Music has launched the Incubator Fund to help under-represented young people into the music business. And why, in order to thrive, I urge the music industry to overhaul recruitment; to reform entry-level roles; to end unpaid internships and become living wage employers; and to build meaningful relationships with music education and grassroots projects.After coming so far, we cannot slip back into the old normal.Matt Griffiths                                          CEO of Youth Music"
