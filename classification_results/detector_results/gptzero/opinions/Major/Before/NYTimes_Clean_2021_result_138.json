Sixto’s voice is an important one to listen to. I did, and Connecticut has been the beneficiary.Joette KatzStamford, Conn.To the Editor:Sixto Cancel details his poor treatment in the foster care system, but his case is the exception.I served for 13 years as an attorney for the Kentucky foster care agency, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. The many social workers I worked with were hardworking and dedicated.When arrangements were being made to remove a child who was neglected or abused, the parents were always asked for names of relatives who might take the child in. Sometimes parents would not give names of relatives. Other times, parents would give reasons that the relative would not be suitable, such as alcohol or drug addiction. If the relative was satisfactory, the child would be placed there.The author cites his bad experiences in foster care. Like every population, some foster parents are unsuited to the job. But the vast majority are good and dedicated, loving and caring for children as if they were their own while knowing they may be removed from their home at any time.I agree that there are still problems in the foster care system. But the system should not be considered broken because of a few bad cases.David T. AdamsLouisville, Ky.To the Editor:Sixto Cancel’s essay paints a damning picture of the state of our child welfare system. One proven intervention that lessens the length of time children and teens spend in care, improves their well-being and academic performance, and increases the odds that they will be reunited with their primary caregivers or find other safe, permanent homes is Court Appointed Special Advocates, or CASA.Operating in many communities in almost every state, CASA recruits, trains and supervises lay volunteers who work with individual children and sibling groups to advocate for their best interests while they are in the child welfare system. We need many policy changes to ensure that at-risk children receive the services, attention, resources and opportunities for safety and permanency that they deserve. CASA helps.Martha GershunFairway, Kan.The writer is former executive director of Jackson County CASA.PHOTO:   (PHOTOGRAPH BY Alyssa Schukar for The New York Times FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
