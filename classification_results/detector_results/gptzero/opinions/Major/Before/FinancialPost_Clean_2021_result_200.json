The price of Western Canadian Select (WSC) crude, the benchmark price for Alberta oil, averaged US$45.13 per barrel in January. By the first week of October, it had increased to $64.78 per barrel. Other things equal, an almost $20 jump in price should stimulate economic activity in Canada's oil sector.But the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the benchmark U.S. oil price, also rose over the same period - from US$59.04 to US$75.65 - so while higher oil prices are a tailwind for Canadian oil and gas companies, absent policy change in Canada (see pipeline restrictions, corporate tax rates, etc.), oil and gas investors likely will continue to favour U.S.-based companies that are also beneficiaries of higher oil prices.Why? Because investment decisions in the private sector are ultimately determined by the expected future profitability of alternative capital expenditure projects, appropriately adjusted for risk. Corporate and private investors in the energy sector will invest in projects located where expected risk-adjusted returns are highest. Investing in the U.S. has been and will continue to be a compelling alternative to investing in Canada for energy companies and institutional investors, and the price of WCS relative to WTI remains only one factor influencing expected profitability.Investors generally don't disclose their expectations about the future profitability of alternative investments. But they can be inferred from financial valuation metrics, including a company's price-to-earnings ratio or its price-to-sales ratio.

From 2011 to 2020, each of the ratios for the portfolio of Canadian oil and gas companies fell relative to its counterpart in the U.S. portfolio. This result is consistent with expressions of concern by executives of Canadian oil and gas companies that Canada is a less and less profitable location for capital investment compared to jurisdictions in the U.S. - and notwithstanding the rise in the WCS price relative to the WTI price from 2017 to 2019.The most recent valuation metrics, those for 2021, do provide a more mixed picture.
