Asking for papers to get on emergency evacuation planes is the equivalent of asking people on a sinking Titanic to provide papers in order to board lifeboats. It is completely wrong.There are 38 million people in Afghanistan and several million are in desperate danger and trying to leave. Kabul airport is hosting a few thousand only at any one time. The numbers being evacuated every day are a drop in the ocean of the full number who desperately need to leave. It is estimated that there are now more than 1m applications for permission to travel via any of the multiple emergency and existing immigration processes in countries around the world.
