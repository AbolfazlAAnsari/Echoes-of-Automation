The enormous loss our nation has already endured is enough.Loss of jobs, evictions and school closures have not only caused a loss of learning to an entire generation but have had a massive mental health impact on many, resulting in an increase in teen suicide. Sadly there were 18 suicides between March and December 2020 in Clark County, Nevada, since the pandemic lockdowns began. We've also seen an increase in opioid overdoses and a rise in liver disease and alcohol abuse to cope with the stress, anxiety and depression brought on by the pandemic.We are all susceptible to COVID. Everyone, kids, teens, seniors.I am still diagnosing positive COVID cases each day.When I ask my patients how they think they may have picked up the virus – the answer is one in which the infection could have easily been prevented, \"I went to a friend's house\" (without a mask) because the friend \"seemed fine.\" Remember, up to half of COVID transmissions are among those who are asymptomatic.Let’s not forget the risk of variants causing spikes and surges remains. I am concerned about the U.K., Brazilian and South African coronavirus variants. When a virus replicates it can mutate, which can give rises to new emerging variants. Some may evade the vaccine and some may be meaningless but let’s thwart any opportunity for the virus to thrive.If we can make a concerted effort to work hard and remain vigilant to reduce the number of cases, deaths and hospitalizations by simple measures of covering your mouth and nose, avoiding crowded areas, practicing physical distancing, especially in areas with poor airflow and ventilation, keeping your hands washed and clean, then maybe we can travel, go on vacation, spend the holidays with our family and do all the things we love.We all have a role in combating this disease. Let’s not have another spring break spike or winter surge. Let's all do our part.I am hopeful and I have faith we will soon overcome this battle, reach herd immunity and live our lives normally once more.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.
