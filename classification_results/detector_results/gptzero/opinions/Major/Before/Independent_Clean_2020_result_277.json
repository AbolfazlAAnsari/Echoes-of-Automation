In the face of the biggest economic hurdle in decades, having the right skills isn't just \"a nice to have\" for businesses - it is essential for survival.If we are to get the economy back on its feet, remain competitive on the global scene and sustain growth, we need to better support all workers to reskill and upskill throughout their careers and encourage them to start adapting their skillsets to the post-pandemic ways of working. This includes changing the apprenticeship levy to an apprenticeship and skills levy for all workers to ensure businesses have the talent they need now and in the future; continuing to invest towards higher level apprenticeships to raise the skill levels of the UK workforce; and introducing a rebuttable right to retrain to empower workers to request further training and development.Andrew Harding, chief executive - management accounting, The Chartered Institute of Management AccountantsNo penalties for footballersWhile the population is subjected to restrictions on travel and socialising, leaving industries facing closure, it seems the same does not apply to sport. With the national, Champions' and Europa leagues, coupled with the European Nations' Cup, hundreds of clubs with their players and entourage are flying backwards and forwards across the country and Europe, as far as Kazakhstan, to play matches.They use aircraft, do not socially distance and then return to their own clubs, using aircraft, trains or cars. The risk of infection somewhere must be huge, yet it is permitted demonstrating total hypocrisy.Peter FieldmanMadridBeethoven's BonnThank you very much for the article, 'How Beethoven's suffering created some of the world's most joyous music' (9 October).I was born and raised in Bonn and remember meeting my friends at the city's favourite meeting place, the Beethoven statue on Bonn's central square. In Bonn, you encounter Beethoven everywhere - streets, squares, concert halls and schools are named after him. During this year's carnival, the whole city sold out of Beethoven wigs as many chose to dress up as the city's prodigious son.However, the reason why Bonn became capital was not because it was the \"last one standing\", as you portray it. Rather, Germany's first chancellor Konrad Adenauer made the case for Bonn. Not only was Bonn \"close to home\" for him (he was from Cologne), it deliberately was a small placeholder for Berlin. For him, choosing Frankfurt, the runner up to become capital, would have been paramount to accepting Western Germany as the new Germany. However, he was keen to make clear that Western Germany with Bonn as a capital was a provisional state, waiting for reunification.And, as if to close the circle, Beethoven provided the soundtrack for reunification itself. The first concert after the fall of the Berlin Wall was Beethoven's \"7th symphony\", conducted by Daniel Barenboim. And in December 1989, during the Berlin Celebration Concerts, Bernstein directed an orchestra of English, French, American, Russian, East and West German musicians performing Beethoven's \"9th symphony\", with one change. Instead of the \"Ode to Joy'\" Bernstein had rewritten the text to \"Ode to Freedom\". Nobody could have scored this joyful moment in German history better than Beethoven himself.Katja StapleLondon E8"
