Biden and Harris had 38 events together in February and just seven in October. As they declined, stories circulated such as: \"Kamala Harris sidelined amid growing tensions with Biden, insiders say.\" Obviously, that violates a core role of the vice president – to be supportive of the president, not a distraction.HARRIS HEADED TO HONDURAS TO TACKLE 'ROOT CAUSES' OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATIONThird, despite her own self-interests, Harris has not made herself known as helping Democrats around the country. Politics is a game of addition. Those who want higher office need to broaden their appeal and gain allies along the way.Yet, Harris recently said that she was \"not going to absolve\" Sens.Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., on the so-called \"voting rights\" bill.History is not particularly familiar with a vice president who became president by arrogantly denouncing sitting U.S. senators – especially those who are currently aligned with the majority on issues such as the filibuster and runaway spending – not to mention the ill-conceived voting rights bill that would eliminate Arizona’s voter ID law, which likely would end Sinema’s career if she voted for it.The good news for Kamala Harris after year one is that in politics, comebacks abound.  Richard Nixon was written off in the early 1960s but became president in 1968 when the Vietnam War split the Democrat Party. Times looked bleak for Bill Clinton, but then he triangulated his way back.Will Kamala Harris find her way back? Only time will tell. On the other hand, the bad news is the talk ofDemocratsis not about her future but whetherHillary Clintonshould be the next nominee.That, too, is part of Kamala Harris’ unprecedented bad, self-inflicted first year and could not be worse news for her.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TOM DEL BECCAROTom Del Beccaro is an author, speaker and columnist.
