They are the stopped clock that is always wrong; they defy comprehension. The terror they engender is not of any single outcome, but the sense that, with this level of unpreparedness, the crisis will never end. There has been a noticeable drop off in media coverage of other countries; you don’t see many graphs of Scandinavia any more. This is not just because, right now, we’re suffering theworst per capita infection rates in the world– it is also a fear of the future, that we’ll watch as every other nation climbs out of its predicament with measures that we should also have been capable of, yet somehow weren’t, until eventually, the whole world is New Zealand, while we’re still here.So it’s time to revisit some of the assumptions of a year ago: it was reasonable, at the start of this crisis, to put aside catcalling and try to find some unity in the face of a shared foe. This is no longer the case: to follow the government anywhere, looking for common ground, will just suck you into its quagmire. Classic political manoeuvres, such as calling for an action you can see they’ll have to take soon anyway, don’t work when the efficacy of any measure has been undermined in advance by the delay in taking it.There was once a presumption of remorse as an important backstop in politics; the belief that a minister would have his or her own standards of consistency and honesty, and if they fell short, their own perception of public or elite disapprobation would be enough to shame them out of office. Implicitly, we no longer rely on that: whenGavin Williamsonparades his incompetence, orPriti Patelis exposed as a bully, we no longer wonder why they don’t resign of their own accord. We only ever ask: “Why aren’t they sacked?” Rather that simply accept this shamelessness as our new reality, we have to think about what it means tactically. There is no point in combing through their bins, looking for evidence of inadequacies they’re perfectly happy to reveal.Instead, both political and civic opponents – which covers an increasing amount of ground, frombusinesses poleaxed by post-Brexit chaos, to scientists who can see themselves being lined up to take the fall, even as they deliver their advice – should focus on the one thing the government demonstrably cannot do: forward planning.Look to the future, and scaffold the hell out of it: scorch the earth for austerity 2.0. Demand the gratitude to NHS and other key workers, when all this is over, be visible in pay packets. Force a new social contract on homelessness and rents. The only way to be insulated from a government that exists in a permanent state of shock is to author the shock ourselves. Be the surprise we want to see in the world.• Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"
