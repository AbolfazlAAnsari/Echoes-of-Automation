Illegal aliens cascade across. Between February 1 and December 31, 2021 -- on Biden's watch -- Customs and Border Protection (CPB) apprehended a record 1,956,596 illegals on the southern \"frontier\" versus 511,192 one year earlier, duringPresident Donald J. Trump’s tenure –up 283 percent.HARRIS SAYS EFFECTS OF BIDEN MIGRATION POLICY WON'T BE SEEN ‘OVERNIGHT,’ AS BORDER CRISIS RAGESBiden gives illegals free tickets to ride buses that whisk them deep into the U.S. interior. Illegal aliens in Brownsville, Texas score free cab rides to the airport, whereupon they jet to Atlanta, Houston, and other cities.Still other illegals -- including single adult males -- board clandestine night flights that land after closing time in New York's Westchester Airport and other airfields. As if in a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch, illegal aliens without papers may use theirarrest warrantsas ID toboard aircraft. Specifically, this is ICE Form I-200 -- Warrant for Arrest of Alien.\"Here's an idea,\" U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., suggested via Twitter. \"If an illegal alien provides an arrest warrant as an ID,you arrest them.\"\"The fact this is even an issue is beyond outrageous,\" said Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont. \"This is a threat to our national security, and it must be stopped immediately.\" Daines has introduced legislation to ban this practice.And these are just the illegals whom CBP intercepted. Biden let an estimated500,00 \"got-aways\" get away. Where are they? Who knows?What we do know is that illegal aliens are arriving in America from some 150 countries. According to Axios, just last December, these included 300 Ukrainians, 500 Turks, 800 Indians, and2,000 Russians.Biden has had an entire year to improve this rapidly devolving mess. Instead, he has not lifted a cuticle.Biden has not toured the \"border\" to fathom this situation, offer solutions, thank the Border Patrol for its valiant efforts, nor even yell at them and demand that they work harder. Biden sedulously ignores this crisis.Biden let an estimated 500,00 \"got-aways\" get away. Where are they? Who knows?Vice President Kamala Harris dropped by the \"border\" once in June. Since then, she sooner would visit a leper colony.Having done nothing about this for a year, one must conclude that this is what Biden wants. The wide-open \"border\" is no accident. It is deliberate. This is not a sign of incompetence. It is a reflection of his relentless, intentional destruction of the southern \"frontier.\"But why? Why would Biden willfully obliterate the U.S.-Mexico boundary and vacuum millions of illegals north?I believe that the open \"border\" is designed to import the maximum number of FutureDemocratsof America. Biden and his ilk see these people as potential voters and, they reckon, a majority will be Democrats. Why bother turning Americans into Democrats when they can lure millions of abundantly grateful illegals who seem likely to vote mainly Democrat?MORE THAN 47,000 MIGRANTS RELEASED INTO US BY BIDEN ADMIN IN 2021 FAILED TO REPORT TO ICE\"For the Left, these policies are practically a fantasy come true,\" Jessica M. Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies with the Center for Immigration Studies, told me. \"The Democrats think that, in the long run, these new arrivals will not only stock certain congressional districts with fresh bodies, but also become loyal Democrat voters.\"\"The people running the policy in the administration are ideologues,\" Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform said. He speculated that Team Biden is \"playing the long game\" at the border.\"In the short-term, it may cost them politically,\" he added. \"But in the meantime, they are establishing facts on the ground. It will be very difficult for any administration to remove all these people once they are here. They may be writing off ’22 and ’24 and looking ahead to ’32 and beyond.\"The Service Employees International Union'sEliseo Medina, an honorary chairman of the Democratic Socialists of America, seems to concur. He said that an influx of immigrants \"will create a governing coalitionfor the long term, not just for an election cycle.\"Jennifer Palmieri, Hillary Clinton’s former communications director, hinted at Democrats’ devious plans to expand their base with illegal aliens. She called the 800,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) designees — whose parents illegally dragged them into the US — \"a critical component of the Democratic Party’s future electoral success.\" Writing about these so-called \"Dreamers\" in a 2018 Center for American Progressmemo, Palmieri added that if Democrat politicians did not defend this cohort, \"the risk is that Latinos fail to see them as a true ally, and as a result sit out crucial elections.\"An even clearer indication of Democrats' true intentions lies in their reaction to legislation by Representative Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas. His measure declared \"the sense of Congress that allowing illegal immigrants the right to votedevalues the franchiseand diminishes the voting power of United States citizens.\" Crenshaw elaborated, \"It should not be a partisan idea that the people who do not legally live in our country cannot legally vote in our elections.\"\"This is a political stunt meant to divide us, meant tosow hatred,\" Rep. Max Rose, D-NY, raged. The late Rep.
