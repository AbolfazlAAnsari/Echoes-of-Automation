We could also have put all private hospitals to work on NHS patients and we could have asked retired NHS to come back in their millions for a massive national effort to clear the backlog - but nothing seems to have been done.Margaret Thatcher was maybe too stubborn with her \"You turn if you want too but this lady is not for turning\" -butBoris Johnsonspins like a top -no integrity and no shame. Who believes Boris now? Not even his own MPs.I wonder how many people have deleted the \"pinging app\" during the past week - and how many more will do so after the Johnson/Rishi Sunak self-isolating debacle?P GoslingAddress suppliedTrouble reconcilingI am a long time follower of Formula 1 racing and I enjoyed watching the drama unfold at Silverstone on the TV -a welcome distraction from the mounting tedium as my wife and I endure an enforced 10-day quarantine.As Lewis Hamilton soaked up the atmosphere on the winners rostrum I had trouble reconciling the behaviour of the fans with our own situation. They were packed into the stands and few if any were making any attempt to take the usual Covid precautions.My wife and I are British nationals living in a low-risk area of rural France and decided (probably against our better judgement) to travel to the UK to visit family some of whom we haven't seen in many many months. We are both doubly vaccinated (Astra Zeneca), we tested negative just prior to our trip and we travelled by car via Eurotunnel. The only contact I had on the way was with a petrol pump - and so we probably entered the UK quite possibly the lowest risk to anybody in the entire country.Nevertheless for some inexplicable reason we are branded as undesirables with government officials ringing us everyday to check we are not breaking our house arrest.Can someone explain to me how this government can apparently condone the behaviour of hundreds of thousands of people at the British Grand Prix which will almost certainly result in a spike of Covid transmission but somehow penalise a couple of grandparents desperate to see their young grandchildren?J WellsAlresfordProtect the vulnerableWe should all take heed of Chris Whitty's caution, as reported in, \"Chris Whitty warns Covid surge could get Britain 'into trouble again surprisingly fast\".It is evident that a sizeable proportion of people in England remain highly vulnerable to the virus. Indeed, the inequality experienced by many groups as a result of Covid-19 has been stark, and exacerbated by a lack of opportunity to voice their concerns. It is now that their voices must be heard.As we move to this next stage, there is a huge risk the health and social care sector could become overwhelmed. This will only be accelerated by current surging infection rates. We can only continue to provide the right care for the people who need it most if we can keep infection rates low, and Covid care available to everyone who needs it. I talk to hospice leaders every day -and can vouch that the effects of the previous surge are still being felt through the system.As restrictions ease, we would insist that we listen to, and protect, the most vulnerable. We must ensure people affected by terminal illness are able to access vital health and care support when they need it, including face-to-face appointments with GPs. And while many of us will be able to venture out, for those who will have to continue to self-isolate, better support must be available.Tracey BleakleyCEO, Hospice UKYears of hurtIn a football ladenMea Culpa, John Rentoul stats that Brazil were given the Jules Rimet trophy \"after they won it three times in 1970.\" Brazil were given the trophy in 1970 having won it for a third time. Not quite the same...Bob ErskineSalisburyWear and tearDavid Riley (letters) refers to the wear on brake pads in electric cars.I own a petrol-electric hybrid which I usually drive with the gear selector set to \"regenerative braking\". The braking effect when I lift my foot off the accelerator is so marked that I rarely need to use the foot-brake and can drive for the most part in one-pedal mode. This has benefits for fuel consumption and brake pad wear. I imagine that battery cars should also be able to be driven in this mode.While I am on the subject of electric cars, I think the motor industry is barking up the wrong tree with its rush towards battery cars. The future is in hydrogen and not lithium. Hydrogen-powered fuel cells are the way forward and will be much better for the environment.Sam BooteNottinghamRead MoreThe end of Covid restrictions?
