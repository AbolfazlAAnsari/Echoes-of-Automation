And it wasn't a pretty sight. As her testimony to the U.S. Congress in October revealed, Facebook continually puts its own profits before our safety; for example, in providing a breeding ground for political extremism and violence or destroying the self-esteem of children and teenagers.That's what you might expect from a multinational corporation, you might say. But, like other Big Tech firms, Facebook is more than simply a multinational corporation; it has become the infrastructure on which we rely to live our lives - to stay in touch with friends and family, to discuss important issues with each other, to find work or customers to secure our livelihoods, and to do many other things. Adding the other Big Tech firms - like Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft - to the mix further highlights our increasing dependence on these digital behemoths.Canada needs to do something about this. But, unlike other countries and jurisdictions around the world, Canada's policy-makers and policy experts are failing at this task. We need a systemic approach to these issues, addressing both privacy and data protection as well as competition policy. Current debates are too disconnected to address the broader implications of these shifting digital sands.I blame this on the fact that many policy experts in Canada seem unable - or unwilling - to comprehend how competition, privacy and their social implications are related. In part, this is likely because we are seeing some very rapid changes, but it is also a consequence, as Vass Bednar has pointed out(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/vass-bednar-canada-can-no-longer-afford-to-be-virtually-lawless-on-big-tech) in the National Post, of who we and our politicians and policy-makers rely on for input.Bluntly, we have put too much faith in economists and lawyers; we need a more inclusive approach by opening up our policy debates and ambitions to a wider array of voices that can say something new about how Big Tech and the concentration of digital markets impact our society in negative ways. And we cannot split off the economic causes of market power from their social consequences without ceding our capacity to do something about those potentially ruinous effects.Economists and lawyers don't have the answers we are looking for. Why? Because they are often wedded to the status quo and a set of outdated ideas and assumptions about the world that are overly focused on so-called economic harms. We have to get beyond this myopia; there are diverse social, cultural and political harms resulting from the sheer concentration of market power in Big Tech that we cannot address from this status quo position. In fact, there is a good chance that sticking with the status quo will simply exacerbate these wider, social harms.Let me give you some examples.First, Big Tech firms have created personal data enclaves as a result of their market dominance and scale that are almost insurmountable. Not only do startups and competitors face significant barriers to entry, thereby deterring innovation, these data enclaves have also stymied regulatory efforts in Canada in pursuit of social or political objectives - a point recently emphasized by Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien. We need to regulate the collection and use of personal data in ways that both respect privacy and open up their use beyond the current data hoarding by Big Tech.Second, the reason to open up data is because there is an increasing concentration of datasets dominating research in machine learning and artificial intelligence. A new arXiv paper called \"Reduced, Reused and Recycled: The Life of a Dataset in Machine Learning Research\" shows that research is increasingly dependent on a small number of datasets held by only 12 U.S. and European institutions, including Microsoft, Google, AT&;T and Facebook. As these datasets become the benchmark for research, they shape not only research outcomes but also research objectives themselves - that is, the very questions that get asked.Vass Bednar: Canada can no longer afford to be virtually lawless on Big Tech(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/vass-bednar-canada-can-no-longer-afford-to-be-virtually-lawless-on-big-tech)Joel Trenaman: Facebook's 'unlawful' deal with Google greater threat than whistleblower revelations(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/joel-trenaman-facebooks-unlawful-deal-with-google-greater-threat-than-whistleblower-revelations)Third, this is important because of the way that algorithmic technologies are increasingly shaped by corporate concerns and imperatives, over and above other considerations. As Meredith Whittaker - Research Director at the AI Now Institute - pointed out in a recent article in Interactions(https://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/november-december-2021/the-steep-cost-of-capture), the dependence of researchers on Big Tech's datasets and computing power - which is needed to use those datasets - means that Big Tech determines the purpose of AI technologies. The scale of Big Tech matters - both in terms of datasets and computing capacity - since it further entrenches their market power and ability to shape the future of such important technologies and their societal deployment.Finally, in shaping future research and technologies, Big Tech ends up extending the inferential harms it already causes. By this, I mean the harms resulting from data analytics that draw in everyone, whether they have notionally agreed to hand over their personal data or not. As SalomÃ© Viljoen, Academic Fellow at Columbia Law School, argued in The Yale Law Journal(https://www.yalelawjournal.org/feature/a-relational-theory-of-data-governance), the collection and use of personal data - by Big Tech or otherwise - now affects everyone because inferences can be made about each of us on the basis of personal data collected from other people. And we can't opt out of that. As a result, the market concentration and power of Big Tech enables these firms to expand their reach beyond those who have consented to data collection.We have to find new voices to shape our competition and privacy policies in order to get at the wider implications that Big Tech has for our societies, economies and lives. We have to bring these two sides of the debate into greater conversation with one another in order to understand how different people and groups are negatively affected. Looking at competition alone cannot do this. We need to hear more diversity in this debate.Special to National PostKean Birch is an associate professor in the graduate program in science and technology studies at York University in Toronto. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
