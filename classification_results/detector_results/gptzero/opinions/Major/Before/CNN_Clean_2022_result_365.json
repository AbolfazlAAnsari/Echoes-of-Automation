In the United States, theConsumer Price Index (CPI)has risen at some of the fastest rates seen since the 1980s.Historically, when such high bouts of inflation have occurred, recessions and widespread job losses have quickly followed. And, in the past, that has led to \"stagflation\" - an unpleasant mix of double-digit inflation, declining economic activity and high unemployment.As the odds of a recession in the US grow, what are the risks that history repeats?Our baseline expectation is for the US to enter a recession in 2023. But we don't expect to see the stagflation that we saw in the 1970s and early 1980s. Here's why:The labor market is still going strongWe now have two of the three ingredients for stagflation - high inflation and low or no economic growth - but we are missing the third: high unemployment. The US labor market is on a tear and shows little sign of contracting, which makes a 1970s-style stagflation scenario far less probable.Consider the following:The US economy added another 315,000jobsin August after tacking on more than half a millionjobsin July. The unemployment rate is 3.7%, not far from a50-year low. Job openings are still plentiful despite thegrowth slowdown.Much of the labor demand reflects a deep need for certain skills across a range of industries, and the labor supply remains insufficient for the jobs at hand, even with lower growth. Even if firms cut their job openings by 20% and increase layoffs by 20%, the US labor market will still be relatively tight, according to our own analysis. And some firms may be reluctant to let go of workers in this coming recession, fearful that they may not be able to hire them back.Consumers don't expect the inflation pain to lastA danger of high inflation is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, making inflation stubbornly \"sticky.\" When people expect prices to rise even further, they will understandably ask for higher pay. (And during labor shortages, they often get it.) To make up the difference in their profit margins, employers in turn charge higher prices for the goods and services they provide, which in turn leads to demand for higher pay, feeding the wage-price spiral. This is what we saw back in the '70s, with anecdotes of employees negotiating double-digit annual wage increases over three years in anticipation of persistent inflation.That said, although measures ofinflation expectationsfor the next 12 months have risen, most consumers, business leaders and the financial markets don't expect such inflation rates to persist much longer after that, according tosurveyandmarket-based measuresof inflation expectations, which have been steadily falling over the past five months after rising the previous two years.We're in a vastly different world today compared to the '70s.
