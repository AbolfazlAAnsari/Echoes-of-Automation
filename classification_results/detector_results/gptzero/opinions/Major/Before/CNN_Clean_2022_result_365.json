But we don't expect to see the stagflation that we saw in the 1970s and early 1980s. Here's why:The labor market is still going strongWe now have two of the three ingredients for stagflation - high inflation and low or no economic growth - but we are missing the third: high unemployment.

To make up the difference in their profit margins, employers in turn charge higher prices for the goods and services they provide, which in turn leads to demand for higher pay, feeding the wage-price spiral. This is what we saw back in the '70s, with anecdotes of employees negotiating double-digit annual wage increases over three years in anticipation of persistent inflation.That said, although measures ofinflation expectationsfor the next 12 months have risen, most consumers, business leaders and the financial markets don't expect such inflation rates to persist much longer after that, according tosurveyandmarket-based measuresof inflation expectations, which have been steadily falling over the past five months after rising the previous two years.We're in a vastly different world today compared to the '70s.
