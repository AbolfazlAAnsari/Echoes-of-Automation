Primary elections favor activists on both parties, promoting fringe views that don't represent popular opinion. Making it worse, unequal representation means that a shrinking percentage of the population elects a growing percentage of the Senate, since each state gets two senators regardless of its size. Byone estimate, 30% of Americans will elect 70% of the Senate by the year 2040.That means that the people making laws in Washington have views that are often at odds with the people's. It's one reason why, for example, most Americans favorstronger restrictionson gun ownership, but Congress is paralyzed on the issue, in part thanks tolarge campaign donationsfrom pro-gun groups, even as gun violence leaves thousands dead every year.At this moment, however, the most alarming disconnect is between the country and the Supreme Court.The history of mankind, as the philosopher Georg Wilhelm FriedrichHegel believed, is the progress of the consciousness of freedom. The pursuit of freedom is the driving force of humanity. But in the US, the arc of history looks set to bend in the opposite direction, and sooner than we might think.Inhis draftoverturning Roe v. Wade, Justice Samuel Alito pointedly alluded to other rulings that transformed the lives of millions of Americans: the Obergfell v. Hodges decision legalizing same-sex marriage and Lawrence v. Texas decision decriminalizing same-sex relationships. Although Alito argues that abortion rights are different from other rulings on \"intimate\" relations, his reasoning on abortion can be seen to apply to those rights, for which the decisions are even less \"deeply rooted\" than Roe.That is a clear message that the Supreme Court, and the fundamentalist Christian political movement, could soon target those decisions. The leaked draft would create the legal foundation for trying to push LGBTQ people back into the shadows. Politiciansare already seedingthat terrain, aiming to harvest votes, no matter how many lives are destroyed in the process.LGBTQ rights, now potentially at risk, are backed by huge majorities.Support for same-sex marriagehas been climbing for years, now at about 70%. And the notion that same-sex relations between consenting adults should be legalis backedby nearly four in five Americans.But even that level of support cannot ensure the rights will survive.There is a good chance, however, that the far-right is overplaying its hand. American democracy is in crisis, but it is very much alive, and the prospect of losing personal rights will awaken a sense of urgency and could boost political involvement.Around the world, those who have been fighting to gain reproductive rights, especially women's groups like those spearheading the Green Wavein Latin America, have been energized by their determination to secure their freedoms and by a series of dramatic victories. In the US, it may take an outrageous defeat -- or perhaps the newfound discovery that a major defeat is imminent -- to transform the political landscape.After all, Americans are not necessarily out of step with the rest of the world. It is their politicians, their judges and their limping democracy that makes it seem that way.Opinion by Frida GhitisTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
