Despite remaining in office until now, Netanyahuhas been indictedand is on trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges. (He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.)Heallegedly triedto bully both journalists and their publishers. Heencouragedsupportive tycoons, like the late Sheldon Adelson, to set up their own newspapers and stations in the hope of driving critical new organizations out of business. Some in the media sold out, but enough kept on going to provide the public with the full picture of events.And he tried to impugn the electoral system,claimingthat it was rife with fraud perpetrated by Arab citizens, but elections continued to be held transparently and with high public trust in their results. It finally yielded a majority that not only prevented Netanyahu from forming a new government of his own, but was capable of working together to replace him.In Israel and in the US, the institutions persevered, outlasted populist leaders and helped bring about their downfall. But the resilience of these institutions cannot be taken for granted -- they require strengthening now that the threat has passed, perhaps only temporarily.Opinion by Anshel PfefferTM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
