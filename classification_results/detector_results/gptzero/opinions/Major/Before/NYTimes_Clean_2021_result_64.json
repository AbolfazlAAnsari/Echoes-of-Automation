The authors could have simply pointed out that, like all investors, Michael Bloomberg has not been required to pay tax on the appreciation in the investment in his company — even though he’s made billions. But using a well-known and well-critiqued loophole as a pretext to justify the publication of tantalizing information that may have been improperly obtained is wrong.Mitchell M. GansHempstead, N.Y.The writer is a professor at Hofstra University Law School who teaches courses in taxation.A High School Student and a Parent, on the Covid PromTo the Editor:Re “A Teenage Rite Evolves and Perseveres” (front page and National pages, June 6):A sincere thank you for highlighting the creativity and perseverance of young people!Trust me — this school year’s seemingly endless bed-to-Zoom-to-bed cycle gets old after a while. We’re clearly growing up during odd times, but stories like this really do give people like me an optimistic outlook ahead of our last few years of high school.Although, to be completely honest, I still wouldn’t mind a regular prom.Andrew KimNovi, Mich.To the Editor:I deeply resented the photo caption on the June 6 front page: “The 2021 prom season has proved that some teenage rites of passage are adaptable, durable and pandemic-proof.”Pandemic-proof? Hardly.In 2020, when the pandemic was raging and shutdowns were widespread, there were no proms at all for most high school seniors, including my own daughter. These teenagers were deprived of such rites of passage and even forced to attend virtual graduation ceremonies.Obviously, the situation is much different today — and more favorable to the lucky teenagers who got to gather and celebrate their final year of high school with a fancy dress-up party.I still haven’t quite gotten over the disappointments of last year. And I’m just a parent. I can only imagine how my daughter and her classmates feel watching the world open up and being reminded of what they have missed.Mary RayisLongboat Key, Fla.PHOTO:   (PHOTOGRAPH BY Illustration by The New York Times; photograph by George Marks/Getty Images FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
