Reasonable grounds were found to believe that the organizations as a whole were involved in or associated with terrorist activities.The same can be said of the IRGC and its Quds Force. The leaders of the IRGC as a whole have recently uttered blood-curdling threats of genocide against Israel and Israelis.The IRGC - and not only its Quds force - is designated under the Canadian economic sanctions regime, but not under the Criminal Code. This creates all sorts of legal anomalies.A Canadian cannot send the IRGC a rocket or missile. But a Canadian can send the IRGC money, which it can then give to the Quds force to buy a rocket or missile.A Canadian can sue the government of Iran for damages resulting from an act of terrorism committed by the Quds Force. But a Canadian cannot sue the government of Iran for damages resulting from an act of terrorism committed by a different component of the IRGC.The downing of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 by the IRGC has perversely led some to argue that it is unwise to list the IRGC at this time. They argue that such a designation would work against the interests of the victims' surviving families by hindering co-operation with the Iranian government.In reality, designation would help these families by allowing them to sue the Iranian government for damages suffered as a result of the plane's destruction. The Canadian Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act allows any person who has suffered damages as a result of a terrorist act by a listed entity to sue a listed state for those damages. Iran is a listed state. The courts have held that the statute operates retroactively. So, if the IRGC were listed, Iran could become liable for damages suffered from the recent tragedy.Mourners attend an outdoor vigil in Toronto on Jan. 9, 2020, for the victims of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, which was shot down in Iran on Jan. 8. Fifty-seven Canadians died in the crash.Terrorist acts are broadly defined in Canadian law. They include criminal negligence at the direction of a terrorist group and activity that \"causes damage to an aircraft in service that renders the aircraft incapable of flight or that is likely to endanger the safety of the aircraft in flight.\" The shooting down of Flight 752 could very well fit those descriptions.The suggestion that better relations with Iran would help the families is belied by experience. Canada had full diplomatic relations with Iran at the time the regime tortured, sexually assaulted and then murdered Canadian journalist Zahra Kazemi in 2003. Those relations did not help her or her family one bit.A related criticism of listing the IRGC is that it would be overly broad because the IRGC is the Iranian Army. This claim is equally ill-founded. The Iranian Army exists separately from the IRGC. The IRGC is a parallel force to the army, created after the mullahs seized power in 1979, to ensure that the army supports the mullahs. It has become a force in its own right, but has not replaced the army.To suggest it is a bad time for Canada to designate the IRGC as a terrorist entity after it shoots down a passenger jet killing 176, including 57 Canadians, turns the notion of timing on its head.If not now, when?David Matas is senior honorary counsel to B'nai Brith Canada.Terry Glavin: There's a revolution going on in the Mideast.
