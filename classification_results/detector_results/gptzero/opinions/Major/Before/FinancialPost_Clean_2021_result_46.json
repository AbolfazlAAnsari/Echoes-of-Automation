            "inputText": "By Stephan LoganSmall businesses are a vital part of the community that can compete with Amazon, and deliver worthwhile benefits to you.But according to the National Post's Jesse Kline, Canada's mom-and-pop shops have only themselves to blame(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/jesse-kline-amazon-made-jeff-bezos-billions-because-the-store-is-easy-to-use-others-should-copy-it) for the online giant driving them out of business.Telling customers it will take a month to deliver something that Amazon can get there in one day just won't cut it, Kline writes: \"It's hard to feel sorry for businesses that still haven't figured out how to provide a decent shopping experience.\"I take issue with Kline's praise for Amazon's free-shipping model and his claim that smaller companies are \"scaring off customers with exorbitant fees.\" Amazon Prime is not free - it costs Canadians $79 each year. But that's not the whole story.Like every other small business, I am at the mercy of Canada Post when delivering small packages. The problem starts with the fact that Canada Post offers no small-package or low-weight options. Whether we ship 30g or 500g, the rates are the same. Guelph, just 20 kilometres away, or Toronto or London, both about 125 kilometres distant, each costs us a minimum of $10.25.Other postal codes offer some surprises. St. Thomas, also 125 kilometres away but on the wrong side of Highway 401 from London apparently, sets us back a minimum of $12.83. Montreal and Quebec City, 625 and 900 kilometres away respectively, come in at less than Toronto at only $9.52. Vancouver is $13.88 and St. Anthony, N.L., a whopping $19.71.In effect, we are paying a premium of $10 to $15 on top of the regular $5.74 charge for a 500g letter, for the privilege of a tracking number and $100 insurance. Our website pulls the rates, the formatted addresses and tracking numbers for our labels directly from Canada Post's website. Technology is supposed to save money. So, what can that cost, a couple of pennies? Even with time spent by a Postie scanning signatures, does delivery for a parcel(https://www.canadapost.ca/information/app/far/business/findARate?execution=e1s1) really cost $10 to $15 compared with $5.74 for a 500g letter?No matter what the real costs are, it's pretty clear that absorbing those charges is a money loser; especially for products in the $10 to $50 range such as Kline referred to.What irks us most is that we pay this premium for 500g when most of what we ship is in the 25g to 100g range. Sure, we could send insect pins or chlorine test strips in regular mail for the cost of first class mail but in this day and age, customers demand a tracking number.An overwhelming situation': Canada Post begs Iqaluit residents to pick up their parcels(https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/an-overwhelming-situation-canada-post-begs-iqaluit-residents-to-pick-up-overflowing-numbers-of-parcels)'Working conditions are hell': Amazon employees not surprised its warehouses have seen hundreds of COVID cases(https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/working-conditions-are-hell-amazon-employees-not-surprised-its-warehouses-have-seen-hundreds-of-covid-cases)Our orders, if received by 2 p.m., ship the same day. That one-month delivery Kline refers to isn't our fault. Canada Post appears to prioritize Amazon shipments, especially at Christmas and other busy times. At least the tracking number allows us to point a finger at those responsible.I'd happily pay Canada Post's 500g maximum envelope rate of $5.74 to ship a 100g package. It would cover 80 per cent of our products and we could safely pack beakers or test tubes along with magnets or prisms. At the very least, our customers wouldn't think we're bandits.I agree with Kline that our nation's stores can improve their online offerings. As he notes, the pandemic has resulted in many of us doing our shopping from our beds. Businesses need to move with the times.So how do we do it? Compared with other companies, we're fortunate. Our customers do the math. They know that even with freight, nearly anything we ship worth $25, along with the added freight, will still cost them less delivered to their door, for products that are of equal or better quality than Amazon's.We've been online(https://www.indigoinstruments.com/ ) since 1994; people know we're credible and knowledgeable. Our Big Bang Theory DNA model was designed and built right here in Waterloo, Ont.Product is automatically labelled along a conveyor inside an Amazon \"Fulfillment Centre\" in Brampton, Ont., in a file photo from July 21, 2017.What can other small businesses do? Start small. Register with Google Local, Bing Places and Apple Maps. At the very least potential customers will know you exist when they do a local search. You may be close enough that they'd be willing to pick up.Adding e-commerce is more challenging, so start with a simple website. Use photos and tell a brief story. Expertise that is only a phone call away is irreplaceable.Small and medium-sized enterprises across Canada play a significant part in our nation's cultural fabric. We care about the niche markets we work in. We pay our staff a fair wage.Can we say, hand on heart, that Amazon's(https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-usps-rural-packages-deliveries-2020-5) best intentions lie there?I want other small businesses to join me in standing up to Amazon. There are thousands of profitable, well-run small businesses across this nation that will be driven out of business if we allow Amazon to go unchecked.Amazon wants us to buy without thinking, but my message would be that before you press the button, take a moment to think whether there's a small business in your town or city that could serve your needs just as well - or even better than Amazon.Stephan Logan is the CEO of Indigo Instruments(https://www.indigoinstruments.com/ ) in Waterloo, Ont. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
