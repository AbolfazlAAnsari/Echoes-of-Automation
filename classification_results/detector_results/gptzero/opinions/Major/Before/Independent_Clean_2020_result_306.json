The PM will have an interesting 2021 in the run-up to the local elections in May.â€¨Alan HutchinsonAddress suppliedFood povertyCaring for others is the cornerstone of the British people's psyche but, it appears, not our government's, unless stimulated by a young footballer.It never ceases to amaze me that, when faced with exceptional adversity, we Brits can rise to the occasion and turn the tide. Our government, who couldn't run a bath let alone a country, have acted too slowly in supporting the desperate people who simply cannot afford to buy food for their families.Amongst others, The Independent has risen to the task in a proactive and selfless way. Its reports on the depressing, dreadful situation regarding the state of the food supply to those in severe need throws a spotlight on the absence of sound judgement and empathy of the government in this dynamically changing crisis.We should not have a situation whereby charities are leading in the relief of hunger when the government drags its collective feet. Charitable organisations ought to be ready to supplement governments efforts, not to lead. There have been a disgraceful number of U-turns in the government's proposals of help to alleviate food poverty, but these are as a result of orchestrated criticism, not a change of heart.I commend all those involved in this wonderful charitable work, it really makes the difference in surviving this pandemic. Children and their parents I know are eternally grateful for much-needed staple food stuffs, which reduces the suffering caused by this terrible pandemic.Keith PooleBasingstokeReckless spendingAs the Children in Need appeal comes round again, we will be exposed to heart-breaking stories of children who have died or are dying of terrible diseases, which, for any right-minded person, cannot fail to tug on the heartstrings. Celebrities will line up to perform one-off shows and auction off meet and greet opportunities with them. For me, though, I like to see the recognition of the many unsung heroes who take care of these unfortunate young ones.The BBC's TV and radio announcers have acknowledged that times are tough right now, but urged us to dig deep for this once-a-year charitable event. And you know we will. We always do. Last year, the great British public gave almost £48m to the cause, which is an incredible amount of money that hopefully went on to make some children's lives more tolerable.But £48m is just a drop in the ocean compared to the amount of money the government wastes, almost continually it seems. Just since March when the pandemic first hit us, it has spent £10bn on the much-derided test and trace programme, plus an additional £15bn on PPE, much of which wasn't suitable. How can these figures be justified and, more importantly, how can the people who made these decisions still be in a job?Moreover, this reckless spending has been going on for years with little or no retribution for the ones doling out the cash. It's just not on. And with the coronavirus bill up to £210bn and rising, the last thing this country needs is government idiots wasting our hard-earned tax money when it comes to paying off the debt.If only we could auction off some ministers.Peter FlynnSheffieldGeoffrey PalmerRe the sad death of Geoffrey Palmer, I am disappointed that your obituary did not mention his excellent role as Dr Price in the Fawlty Towers episode The Kipper and the Corpse,and especially his memorable line in it: \"I'm a doctor and I want my sausages!\"Nick HawardHavant, Hampshire"
