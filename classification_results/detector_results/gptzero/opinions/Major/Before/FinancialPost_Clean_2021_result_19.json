            "inputText": "The father of a dear friend of mine passed away a few weeks ago. In his younger days he was an actor. In his older days, he was wonderfully edgy, often startlingly politically incorrect and admiring of women in a wickedly chivalrous way not often seen these days. My favourite memory will always be of him striding through the school playground where my friend and I would pick up our kids, confidently sporting linen pants, great shoes and a perfectly sand-coloured panama hat, joking with the moms as he went.As he aged, the years took tight hold of his body. His purposeful stride evolved into a slow shuffle, shoulders bent, hands tightly gripping a walker for support. Still, he remained chatty and charming. His daughter Rosie and I talked often about what the future held for him, but also for her, as his only child, and his caregiver. She had been witness to my many tears over my own father who had been dying of dementia for almost a decade in a long-term care home. We were witnessing a part of our lives - a piece of a generation - disappear forever, right before our eyes.When things started to go wrong - lung infections, paralyzing body pain, overall malaise - Rosie's dad retreated to his apartment, spending too much time in bed and not enough eating. His decline was palpable. When worrisome fatigue landed him in the hospital last November, COVID-19 was raging and virus protection protocols meant that Rosie could only leave clothes and food with a masked person at the hospital door and hope for the best.Tests showed a possibility of serious illness and Rosie's dad waved the white flag - it was time to go home. A few weeks later, having not left his bed, he asked her to start thinking of a date. He was ready to be done with this life and needed help.\"But how can I just pick a day for my dad to die?\" Rosie asked, her voice shaking slightly, as we chatted on the phone about the pros and cons of a medically assisted death.Bill C-14 vs. Bill C-7Bill C-14, which gives Canadians the right to get medical help with their death, became legal in 2016. To be eligible, a person had to meet a set of criteria(https://www.dyingwithdignity.ca/get_the_facts_assisted_dying_law_in_canada#eligibility) that included being at least 18 years old and having requested medical assistance in dying (MAiD) voluntarily and uncoerced. They also had to be living with a \"grievous and irremediable medical condition,\" characterized by declining health and a \"reasonably foreseeable\" death, and be \"mentally competent and capable of making decisions\" when making the request.Since then, there have been almost 14,000 medically assisted deaths reported in Canada, according to the federal government, and the number is rising. In 2019, 5,631 Canadians chose MAiD - up 26.1 per cent from 2018.In 2020, with pressure from MAiD advocates, the federal government tabled an amendment to Bill C-14, removing the eligibility requirement that death be imminent. According to Bill C-7, just being sick was enough reason to request medical assistance with death. The federal government has been granted three extensions to review the changes, with the deadline now being set for Feb 26, 2021.The proposed change is not without its critics. A physician-led campaign called MAiD to MAD - Medically Administered Death -said the amendment would see people offered death before, or instead of, options like counselling and other support services.Other criticisms have come from MAiD supporters who dispute the requirement that someone who is already approved for medically assisted dying give consent a second time. The rule has forced some to end their lives earlier than they have to for fear they may lose the ability to consent later. One such person was 57-year-old Audrey Parker, a Halifax woman with terminal cancer who, afraid that the cancer in her brain would affect her ability to clearly consent, chose to die on Nov. 1, 2018, when really, she had hoped to spend Christmas with her family.All of this got me thinking about whether my dad would have wanted to choose how he was going to go out. I imagine he would have decided on a swallow of his favourite scotch with his peeps beside him, instead of taking his last breath paralyzed, unable to eat or drink, drooling, with red-hot bedsores all over his back.Should life always be the goal?My brother is currently facing down round two of liver cancer. He has lived with pain and bad prognoses all of his life - after living with a severe bleeding disorder, then contracting HIV and hepatitis C through a blood transfusion, he's no stranger to contemplating The End. When he found out he had relapsed after five not great, side-effect-laden years of remission, the word on the family grapevine was that he wouldn't take any more drugs that, in their bid to keep him alive, made him want to die. He'd find a way to end it sooner, he announced to my mother. \"No,\" we said, pleading with him to explore any options with his doctors. \"What about the kids?\" we asked, as if they weren't top of mind. What we really meant, at least a little bit, was \"What about us?\"But shouldn't he, like Rosie's dad -like all of us - be given the space and support to choose how much pain and discomfort he should have to go through? Certainly, people can't be choosing death willy-nilly, but if it's in the cards without a doubt, don't we deserve to be the one who decides when the plug gets pulled?In the time leading up to The Day, Rosie's dad ate lobster and chocolate and ice cream and cake. He visited with his grandkids and told stories the way he used to. He hung out with a friend's favourite dog. He said what he needed to say, as did Rosie, and when the doctor came, the send off was calm and peaceful. With those who loved him the most sitting by his bedside, he went to sleep and left this world the way he lived - on his own terms. A final bow to all that he was - and leaving such a gift with the people who loved him.Lisa Machado is the executive producer of Healthing.ca.(https://www.healthing.ca/ )Colby Cosh: Our ever-evolving MAID laws(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/colby-cosh-our-ever-evolving-maid-laws)Opinion: Proposed changes to MAID are pure madness(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-proposed-changes-to-maid-are-pure-madness) !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
