It introduces a new essay series and newsletter for Times subscribers by the musician and activist Tom Morello.You can sign up for that newsletter here.While deep in quarantine with my family after the murder of George Floyd last year, I remembered this movingletter of recommendationthat The New York Times Magazine published about Rage Against the Machine in 2018. Jonah Weiner wrote about his appreciation for the band and how pieces of art can consume us and define periods in our lives in important ways. Visionary works of literature or music become time capsules or soundtracks to our lives that you can revisit and remember. I was left wondering what the soundtrack would be for the time we’re living in now.I couldn’t shake Jonah’s piece from my mind. I began to explore the music of R.A.T.M. and become a student of Tom Morello. As I researched, what I found was more than just a guitarist and musician; he was a visionary and a thinker with a unique background and deep ideas about culture and politics. I felt confident he would be a fascinating person to hear from as we think about what our society needs, going forward.And I wasn’t alone in this. After pitching my dream of having him write for Times Opinion, I learned that my colleague Jane Coaston has been a fan for years. She writes, below, an introduction to him to help you understand the meaningful presence he’s had in pop culture, music and protest movements over the past three decades.Tom’s residency with Times Opinion starts tomorrow and will continue over the next 12 weeks, offeringa series of essaysthat will examine his music, as well as the music of others, offering insight into the ideas and arguments shaping the world today.
