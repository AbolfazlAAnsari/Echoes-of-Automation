We could tackle the climate crisis in a way that puts power into the hands of communities, delivers millions of new green jobs, affordable and accessible public transport, and warm homes to tackle fuel poverty. The alternative is a slow transition that at worst misses the window to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown, and at best leads to millions of job losses, increases inequality by pushing the cost on to working people, and reserves any benefits for corporations and wealthy individuals.That's where a new wave of disruptive, solutions-based campaigns come in. Youth activist groups such as the Sunrise movement in the US are holding sit-ins in the offices of Democratic party leaders, whileGreen New Deal Risinghere in the UK is doorstepping politicians to put them on the spot about how we should tackle this crisis. With time we may see these actions as defining moments that changed the trajectory of the fight against climate change.For those who criticise direct action, not only have many interventions been successful, but polling shows 71% of people say theyhaven't had their lives disruptedat all by protest in the past three years. Given the changes protesters seek to instigate, which can deliver positive outcomes for people across society, it's no wonder that many climate protests eventually receive majority public support.This is true not just for climate protesters but in the history of social change. From the Suffragettes to the anti-apartheid movement, people who took disruptive action are now considered to have been on the right side of history, despite often widespread opposition in their time.Fatima Ibrahim is the co-founder and co-director of Green New Deal Rising"
