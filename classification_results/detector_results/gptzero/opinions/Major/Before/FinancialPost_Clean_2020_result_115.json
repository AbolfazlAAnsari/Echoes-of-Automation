After all, best practices presumably aren't ends in themselves but means of achieving ultimate purposes.You might assume that following best practices correlates with superior performance and shareholder loyalty. But that does not appear to be the case. In a study of \"value-investor CEOs,\" that is, CEOs who had the investing skills necessary to take the cash their company generated and deploy it to the best value-maximizing opportunity for the company, one of us (Athanassakos) identified an elite group of exceptional capital allocators, 41 Canadian and 167 American. The study ranked companies by their success in capital allocation and then compared portfolios comprised of those at the top versus the bottom. On average, the superior allocator portfolio outperformed the inferior one by 33 per cent in cumulative three-year returns over several recent decades.Terence Corcoran: Time to start the corporate ESG revolt(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-time-to-start-the-corporate-esg-revolt)Terence Corcoran: Michael Sabia and the ESG takeover(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-michael-sabia-and-the-esg-takeover)Terence Corcoran: If LGBTQ+ boards boost value, do it!(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-if-lgbqt-boards-boost-value-do-it)Terence Corcoran: Can Ottawa resist the Great Reset?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-can-ottawa-resist-the-great-reset)Overlaps in the data sets are revealing. Of the best 41 Canadian capital-allocating companies, 28 were also ranked in the University of Toronto governance study. Among the leading capital allocators, however, only four ranked in the top quarter of the governance rankings: Emera, TC Energy, Fortis and Telus. By contrast, some of the best capital allocators - including CGI, Restaurant Brands, Rogers Communications, and Westshore Terminals - ranked lowest on the governance scale.In related research, one of us (Cunningham) found that the superior allocators attracted the most patient and focused shareholders. These are shareholders with the longest average holding periods and most concentrated portfolios - neither traders, who sometimes buy large stakes but never hold for long, nor indexers, who may hold for the long term but never concentrate. Warren Buffett has dubbed this cohort \"high-quality shareholders.\" Having lots of them in a company is associated with superior corporate performance(https://www.marketwatch.com/story/warren-buffett-knows-these-are-the-best-investors-to-follow-with-your-own-money-2020-09-30).This research also investigated what sets these \"high-quality\" managers and shareholders apart.In general, they march to their own drum. For instance, rather than focus on quarterly earnings per share or market capitalization, they stress intrinsic value, long-term performance metrics, such as return on invested capital, and analytics like internal rate of return. Rather than necessarily conforming to consensus best-governance practices, they show a variety of approaches(https://www.marketwatch.com/story/indexers-blast-these-3-corporate-decisions-but-they-actually-can-boost-a-companys-and-shareholders-results-2020-11-19?mod=outside-the-box) to such matters as dual-class stock, combining or splitting the CEO and board chair roles, and whether or not to stagger the terms that board members serve.In contrast, the U of T rankings give the highest marks for conforming to standardized practices, without probing to what extent, if at all, they may be expected to result in superior capital allocation or shareholder stewardship. For instance, the study credits \"one-share, one-vote\" capital structures, thus penalizing dual-class companies, but without considering the particular history, reasons and context for the differences. Likewise, it credits companies that split the roles of chairman and CEO, but without recognizing that combining them remains both common and apparently effective at a large portion of public companies.Similarly, the U of T ranking credits boards that require directors to own a certain amount of the company's stock, when it would obviously be preferable to credit directors who buy large stakes(https://www.marketwatch.com/story/click-here-on-a-companys-website-for-clues-about-how-the-stock-will-perform-2020-11-11) without being required to do so. Similarly, the rankings weight handling of stock options heavily - in terms of hurdles, vesting periods, dilution - without crediting companies who simply avoid using them due to their questionable effects and contested accounting.Some practices used in the rankings probably are good indicators of a board's likely stewardship, particularly an item addressing the disclosure of individual director biographies and each director's \"qualifications to represent shareholders.\" Less obviously relevant indicators are directors' ages and whether they serve together on other boards or serve on multiple boards. Many other criteria reflect larger social issues, rather than individual corporate issues - for example, how many board members are women, disabled, or Indigenous.All these and other governance practices can be important but what ultimately matters are results. After all, boards are not paid to be independent of management, diverse within society, or promoters of best practices. They are paid to discharge their duties as fiduciaries to promote the best interests of their corporation and its shareholders, taken as a whole. Corporate governance issues obviously shouldn't be ignored but measuring boards on outcomes is the key to promoting accountability.George Athanassakos, a professor of finance, holds the Ben Graham Chair in Value Investing at the Ivey Business School, Western University.
