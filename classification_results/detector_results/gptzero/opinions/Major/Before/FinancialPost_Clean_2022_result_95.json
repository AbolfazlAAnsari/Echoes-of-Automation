To thrive in this rapidly unfolding, national interest-driven context, Canada needs to shift the weight of economic policy from the demand side of the famous supply-demand equation toward a massive supply rebuild.Simply put, it's time to become ambitious builders again, as we were in the two decades following the Second World War, when, in short order, we constructed the St. Lawrence Seaway, Trans-Canada Highway and TransCanada Pipeline, along with new mines, new dams, new campuses, new suburbs, new hospitals and new airports.Judging from her recent remarks, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland is wrestling with how to reorient economic policy from consumption in the present to investment in the future. While we hope to hear more in the government's fall economic statement this week, the Public Policy Forum has been readying our own call to action in the form of a report, published today, intended to turn the country's attention to the vast potential of a concerted supply side agenda.If Canada is going to confront today's challenges and seize tomorrow's opportunities, we need to increase the supply of everything from housing to hydrogen, from IP to ICUs, from quantum computing to the next mRNA, from long-term investments in critical minerals to longer-term investments in human capital. We need to increase the supply of things, ideas and people, too - the programmers, scientists, welders, teachers, nurses and countless others on whose backs and brains a modern economy travels.We are far from alone in issuing this call. In the United States, it's coming from both the left and the right, holding out promise that a supply rebuild can anchor the kind of economic consensus that prevailed in Canada and elsewhere in the 1950s and 1990s. It's been called a \"Building More Stuff(https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/a-new-industrialist-roundup)\" agenda, supply side progressivism(https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/opinion/supply-side-progressivism.html), an \"abundance agenda(https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/scarcity-crisis-college-housing-health-care/621221/)\" and \"state capacity libertarianism(https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/01/what-libertarianism-has-become-and-will-become-state-capacity-libertarianism.html).\" Some particulars may differ but the basic premise is the same: the time is long past for a third-wave successor to Keynesianism and neoliberalism that concerns itself with our capacity to build, produce and grow in an inclusive manner.Harvard economist Dani Rodrik, perhaps its most persistent champion, writes(https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/new-productivism-economic-policy-paradigm-by-dani-rodrik-2022-07) about a \"new productivism\" that preferences production and investment over financialization and the welfare of local communities over globalization. In practical terms, it amounts to a departure from the Keynesian model \"by focusing less on redistribution, social transfers, and macroeconomic management and more on supply-side measures to create?good jobs?for everyone.\"Even U.S. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen is talking(https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0565) up a \"modern supply-side economics that prioritizes labour supply, human capital, public infrastructure, R&;D, and investments in a sustainable environment.\" It's not merely talk either. The U.S. Congress has passed two recent pieces of bipartisan legislation (the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act) to massively boost domestic production of clean energy, including carbon capture facilities and hydrogen development, as well as semi-conductor technologies.These political economy developments stand in contrast with the recent history of policy-making in Canada and elsewhere. The demand side has dominated 21st-century economics through pump-priming in the 2008-09 global financial crisis and the pandemic. Even in less extraordinary circumstances, political parties of all stripes have shown more interest in current redistribution than in building the next generation of production capacity to mitigate against climate change, counter Chinese and Russian influence and stave off the polarization of the dislocated and disaffected.The new supply movement pushes policy beyond defensive strategies. Building things and nurturing talent means playing offence. Unlike demand policies driven from the centre, a new supply-side sensibility requires close partnerships between the state's ability to set priorities and the private sector's ability to deliver on them.John Ivison: Chrystia Freeland's fiscal update peers into the Truss trap(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-ivison-chrystia-freelands-fiscal-update-peers-into-the-truss-trap)The very Canadian problem at the heart of our supply chain woes(https://financialpost.com/transportation/rail/canada-supply-chain-woes)A supply rebuild would require an all-in commitment from policy-makers and business leaders. Canada may be blessed with critical minerals such as nickel and copper that the world needs to develop batteries and manufacture wind turbines, but getting a new mine into production takes 16 years(https://issues.org/environmental-economic-costs-minerals-solar-wind-batteries-mills/ ) on average. Ontario's much ballyhooed Ring of Fire has been the stuff of dreams since the mid-2000s. Yet neither the energy transition, nor our capacity to credentialize newcomers or train enough health-care professionals, can afford complacency.A supply rebuild would be good not just for our economy but also for the health of our politics. For the moderate left, it would provide a renewed commitment to public investment and a focus on market-shaping policies over the invisible hand of the recent decades. For the moderate right, the model would unblock the labyrinthine accumulation of rules and regulations, often with the best of intentions, that keep even \"good things\" like wind farms and housing starts from getting done.This year's fall economic statement happens to be close to the 40th anniversary of the launch of the Royal Commission on Economic Union and Development Prospects for Canada, best known as the Macdonald Commission for its chair, one-time Liberal cabinet minister Donald S. Macdonald. He understood in a similar context of disruption and uncertainty that Canadians yearned for a clear sense of national direction. He famously urged us to take a leap of faith on free trade with the Americans.That may have been the last big idea in Canadian politics. It's time for a new leap of faith. We believe a supply rebuild is it.Special to National PostEdward Greenspon is President and CEO of the Public Policy Forum.
