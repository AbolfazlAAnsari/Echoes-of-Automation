The prime minister seems to feel that he has drawn a line under the Dominic Cummings affair and that the British people want to move on.The reality is that people remain outraged at the hypocrisy and ridiculous excuses that he and Cummings have provided us with. Maybe an action like this would convince him that people will not be satisfied until Cummings resigns, or is sacked. We are tired of being treated like idiots who don't understand simple messages like \"stay at home\".Caroline Costello                                          DurhamWe are not ready to ease lockdown​I was amazed to learn that the government has gone ahead with easing lockdown and again is risking the lives of all of us, especially key workers, despite several of the scientists on the Sage group believing that this is a high-risk strategy since the R rate is so close to one.For weeks the government has been telling us it is being led by the science. Obviously not.The government needs to get ahead of the game with reliable and readily available testing within reach of all. The vast majority of the public, Dominic Cummings excluded, have been observing recommendations. Now our weak prime minister and his clique of senior ministers, and a certain adviser, are willing to jeopardise the lives of all.Shame on them.Alison ter Haar                                          Compton Dando, SomersetThe push from Greg Clark, chair of the Commons Science and Technology Committee, for the government tolower the 2m social distancing ruleto a metre and half to help the hospitality sector could inevitably increase the risk of infection with Covid-19. It would make more sense to increase the floor space in which the hospitality sector operates by having more dining places outside on the pavements, in car parks or even temporarily closing roads. Will the government think outside the box to support the hospitality industry?Kartar Uppal                                          Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham"
