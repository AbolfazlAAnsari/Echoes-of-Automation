The couple sensed my interest and brought the puppy over for me to stroke, which made me bristle, but I gave it a quick pat on the head and then felt bereft when they got off the train.This was shortly after lockdown and I wrote it off as an aberration, born of so many months of isolation. But since then I have noticed that I no longer flinch when a dog walks past and increasingly throw backward glances at it. What's led to this change? I think to myself, and can't formulate an answer. Maybe some of us have been marked by social isolation in ways that can't quite be rationalised yet.Living alone for so many months, I did find myself questioning opinions and beliefs that had, over the years, become absolutes: that I never get lonely, that neighbours are never there for you in London, that independence is always empowering, that nature doesn't thrive in a city. The end of lockdown was a chance to reset and go back into the world slightly more joyfully, more open to things, even if most of the resolutions to work less, cook more and meditate every day quickly fell by the wayside.I'm not sure that dogs featured in this mental recalibration, but maybe being more open to things has shifted my prejudice towards them.Since the puppy on the train, I have found myself admiring the sleek silver fur of a greyhound resting in a sunny spot of a pavement cafe, and making eye contact with what I'd previously have dismissed as a scratty mongrel outside the supermarket. I'll occasionally stop and make clucking noises at a mutt, ready to make friends, but it  will be the one to turn its back on me or simply stare, as if it's unsure. Dogs, I realise, are picky about humans too. Not so different from cats, after all.Arifa Akbar is the Guardian's chief theatre critic"
