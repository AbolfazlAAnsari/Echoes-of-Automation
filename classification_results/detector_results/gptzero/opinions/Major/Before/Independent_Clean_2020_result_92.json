It was reported recently that the offer of vital medical equipment from Europe was turned down by the UK government, despite the obvious shortages of protective equipment and ventilators. Boris Johnson is determined to take the country out of the EU without a deal if necessary at the end of this difficult year. No ifs, no buts.So far, one of the few silver linings in all these clouds has been the deafening silence from the chief architect of all this potential chaos, Nigel Farage - that is, until yesterday, when he popped up online with a characteristically self-centred rant against the current restrictions. Poor Nigel! But at least we've got our country back - or what will be left of it when this crisis is over.Sue Breadner                                          Douglas, Isle of ManTesting, 1, 2, 3Quite rightly, Dr Anthony Costello hasaskedwhy the UK's 44 molecular virology laboratories have not been utilised for testing coronavirus.The UK seems unable to deal with crises such as, inter alia, severe weather, and now a health pandemic. The government had an early opportunity to equip the country with protective equipment, ventilators and sufficient testing kits but has failed to do so. We have only just reached the 10,000 per day testing milestone, which compares woefully with other countries. Due to NHS staff shortages, doctors and other surgeons are now working with nurses to treat Covid-19 patients.I truly trust that the government examines its performance when this catastrophic situation eventually disappears so as to protect the country in the future from another, potentially more serious, outbreak.Christopher Learmont-Hughes                                           Caldy​, Wirral"
