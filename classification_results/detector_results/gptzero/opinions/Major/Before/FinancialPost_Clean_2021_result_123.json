James Walton Godfrey, B73053, 48th Highlanders of Canada, who enrolled for active service on Sept. 8, 1939, at the age of 17 (having lied about his age), standing 5-foot-7 and weighing 122 pounds. Following in the footsteps of his father, Pte. James Godfrey, 3951, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, Second Battalion (who served in Europe in World War I, and with the Veteran Guards of Canada in World War II), Pte. Godfrey the younger set sail with the 48th for overseas service in England and Italy in December 1939, leaving behind a pregnant wife. He returned to Canada six years later, in December 1945, to a divorce and a child who did not know him. Demons would haunt him (as they did his father) for the remainder of his life until his early death in 1971.Pte. James Walton Godfrey of the 48th Highlanders was one of more than 93,000 Canadians who took part in the Italian campaigns of the Second World War. He returned home to a broken home, writes his nephew, Paul Philip Willis.The Second World War was a brutal conflict, in all theatres of war across the globe, resulting in approximately 85 million(https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-worldwide-deaths-world-war) military and civilian deaths, and marked by unimaginable atrocities committed by Nazi Germany, the Empire of Japan and Fascist Italy. As the forces of darkness spread across the planet, the possible defeat of Allied armies, and subsequent invasion of North America, were very real and terrifying possibilities.In the face of this existential threat, while Canadian soldiers were fighting, losing limbs and dying overseas, the Canadian government took defensive and pre-emptive action, ostensibly to preclude acts of espionage or sabotage on the home front, sending thousands of Canadians of Japanese, German and Italian ancestries to internment camps spread across the country. Not one of Canada's finest moments; however, for perspective (though not for exculpatory purposes), a Canadian civilian caught in enemy territory during the war would have been sent to far less humane prisons or concentration camps and/or executed.Pte. James Godfrey Sr., the father of Pte. James Walton Godfrey, is seen in 1912 with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. He served in Europe in the First World War and with the Veteran Guards of Canada in the Second World War.In 1988, former prime minister Brian Mulroney rightfully offered a full apology, on behalf of Canada, and announced financial settlements to Canadians of Japanese ethnicity (and their families) who had suffered internment and subsequently lost their homes, businesses and livelihood. In 1990, while addressing the National Congress of Italian Canadians, Mulroney also acknowledged the \"wrongs done to our fellow Canadians of Italian origin during World War II.\" Interestingly, the current government of Canada has proclaimed its intention to issue another act of contrition to Italian-Canadians for the same transgression, although financial compensation (reparations, \"educational funding\" etc.), if any, has not been disclosed.One can appreciate and support the need for genuine expressions of remorse, and indeed monetary recompense, that serve as redresses of grievances for Canadians and their immediate descendants who were harmed by historical government policy, including Italian-Canadians who were treated poorly during the war. However, the recent inclination for politicians of all stripes to continually beg forgiveness, and thus curry favour and votes, from any given \"aggrieved\" identity group serves only to diminish the sincerity of apologies that are otherwise well deserved and necessary for closure. Worse, these gestures are far too often infused with the false and dangerous leftist notion that Canada is founded on racist ideologies that continue to infest our current society, and only through tearful and dramatic displays of shame (that would make Mao Zedong blush) and a redistribution of wealth can we purge the nation of the xenophobic evils perpetrated by our anglophone and francophone ancestors.Intellectual honesty demands that we view any event in our nation's past, including Second World War internments, not through the narrow and myopic lens of racial discrimination alone, but rather through an understanding of historical context and the myriad complexities inherent to the time period in question. Indeed, in the decades after World War II, Canada displayed tremendous generosity, and magnanimity in victory, in spending billions rebuilding and continuing to defend Europe, and welcoming to this land hundreds of thousands of Italian, German and Japanese immigrants - many who had served in our enemies' armies. This historical reality is hardly reflective of a systemically racist nation.While I am pleased for my compatriot Italian-Canadians who will be receiving a long overdue formal apology, on my part I will periodically visit that gorgeous monument in Nathan Phillips Square and, being Irish, perhaps raise a wee dram and salute the Canadians who served their country with honour and valour in order to defeat tyranny in Europe - including my uncle, Pte. James Walton Godfrey and my grandfather, Pte. James Godfrey.National PostPaul Philip Willis is a freelance writer living in Toronto. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved."
