Theoverwhelmingly majorityof people arrested in connection with the January 6 attack have been granted bail, according to PolitiFact.Those defendants still in jail deserve to be there because of the severity of crimes with which they have been charged. Among them are members of theOath Keepersmilitia and theProud Boys-- some of whom were charged with \"seditious conspiracy\" -- and others who areaccused of brutally beatingpolice officers and other heinous acts. Judges hearing the charges against these suspectshave deemedthat they pose a threat to the community were they to be released on bail.Imagine if, about 18 months after a terrorist attack, a booth at a Democratic event attempted to elicit sympathy for those arrested for their role in a deadly strike on our nation! Critics would lash out at Democrats as unpatriotic Americans who support terrorism. And they would be right to do so.That's the same revulsion the vile display at CPAC deserves from all of us.Opinion by Dean ObeidallahTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
