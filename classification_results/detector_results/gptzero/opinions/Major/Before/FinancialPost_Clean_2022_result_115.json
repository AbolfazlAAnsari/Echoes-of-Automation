            "inputText": "By Herbert GrubelCanada's health care(https://financialpost.com/tag/health-care/) system is one of the costliest(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/comparing-performance-of-universal-health-care-countries-2022?utm_source=Email&;utm_campaign=Comparing-Performance-Universal-Health-Care-2022&;utm_medium=Dev_email&;utm_content=Learn_More&;utm_term=700) and most poorly performing of all the universal public health care systems in the Western democracies. Now, according to Alika Lafontaine(https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadian-health-care-system-collapse-1.6590461), head of the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) it is on the verge of collapse.Indications of collapse abound. Millions of Canadians cannot find a family doctor, wait lists for specialists are at record lengths, access to diagnostic equipment is severely limited and the emergency departments of hospitals are sometimes closed.What can be done to improve the system's performance and prevent an even bigger collapse? The CMA says: \"It's time to stop pouring money into a broken health system and invest in a new one.\" In answering(https://www.msn.com/en-ca/health/health-news/michael-higgins-it-is-trudeau-not-poilievre-who-is-cold-hearted-about-rising-food-prices/ar-AA13RICH) a question in Parliament about health care, even Justin Trudeau(https://financialpost.com/tag/justin-trudeau/) said, \"We can't just throw money at it.\"The most recent federal proposal(https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/health-ministers-meeting-vancouver) for improving the system is \"creation of a countrywide health database, which would track health outcomes based on a set of common indicators.\" For its part, British Columbia's government has announced reforms(https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2022HLTH0212-001619) to relieve the shortage of family physicians and end chaos in health care by paying doctors \"on the basis of time spent with patients, the number of patients seen in a day, the number of patients attached to their practice, the complexity of the patient's issues, and their office overhead costs.\"These responses and others like them are totally inadequate. Whatever operational improvements they may provide will be accompanied by significant administrative costs both for governments and for doctors, who will have to take more and more time to fill out more and more forms.Since the creation of Medicare in 1966 there have been many changes like those recently proposed. They obviously have not prevented the present chaos. The fundamental reason is that the system is planned and operated by the government. As Milton Friedman(https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/milton_friedman_387252) put it: \"If you put the (U.S.) federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in five years there'd be a shortage of sand.\"What would happen if instead Canada's health care system relied on free markets rather than government planning? There would be no more doctor shortages, waitlists or limited access to diagnostic facilities and hospitals. Doctors, hospitals, nurses and others would provide the best services they could, using the best technology, to attract patients to their practices. As always happens in a market system, prices would adjust to make that happen. Competition would limit providers' profits, just as it limits the profits of bakers who serve customers without shortages and with better quality and greater variety of baked goods every passing year.Jack Mintz: Ottawa's fourth wireless competitor fixation slows 5G adoption(https://financialpost.com/opinion/telecom-ottawa-fourth-wireless-competitor-fixation-slows-5g-adoption)Philip Cross: Greedflation? It's a government thing(https://financialpost.com/opinion/philip-cross-greedflation-inflation-government)Opinion: $10-a-day-daycare was a disaster foretold(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-10-a-day-daycare-disaster)Many Canadians would oppose the adoption of such a free-market system over concerns that their and their families' future medical problems could impose large costs on them. In a free market, insurance(https://financialpost.com/category/fp-finance/insurance/) companies would provide the opportunity to allay these concerns through the purchase of insurance.The total amount of money raised through insurance premiums would have to cover the cost of the services provided by the industry. But because of market competition this amount would be lower than the current tax-financed system requires. Canadians would get health care by paying the providers and insurers of their choice rather than paying taxes to the government.Poor Canadians might not be able to afford such premiums. The government could help them using general welfare programs. A more targeted approach would be to create a publicly owned non-profit insurance company authorized to provide health insurance for the poor. The funds needed for this would come from taxes, which fall heavily on higher-income Canadians, which means current income equalization efforts would continue. A publicly owned company along these lines exists in Germany. It competes with private companies and charges premiums, which private companies obviously cannot exceed if they want to stay in business.Private insurance companies would compete with the public company by providing better services, especially by offering premiums at different rates depending on the chosen level of co-payments, i.e., the amount the insured person pays for each doctor visit or treatment. Such co-payments reduce the demand for health care for the benefit of all users, just as co-payments on car insurance do.The Canadian health care system is collapsing and cannot be saved by more money or merely marginal changes in operation and data collection. Fundamental reform is needed and the return to free markets is the best alternative.Herbert Grubel, professor emeritus of economics at Simon Fraser University, is a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
