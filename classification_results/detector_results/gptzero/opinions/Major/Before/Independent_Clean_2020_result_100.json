I always found it an erudite, interesting paper and I have even flicked through it a few times since I retired.Therefore I was rather saddened to learn that, along with the Jewish News, it will close. This is a paper that was founded in 1841.I just hope that after this crisis is finished a similar newspaper can be salvaged along the same lines for the Jewish community in our country.Robert Boston                                          Kent"
