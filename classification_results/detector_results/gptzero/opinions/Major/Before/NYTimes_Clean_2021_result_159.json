Lamas (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 7):My first wife died 10 years ago from a brain tumor at 34. We did everything we could to get her access to the best treatments available at a premier treatment center, and the prognoses were deceptively optimistic.It became clear to me that doctors are incentivized to give patients and their families overly optimistic prognoses for two reasons. First, they understandably are trying to avoid the negative backlash of those who can’t handle the truth. Second, they understand that a positive attitude can contribute to a more positive outcome.I am so grateful that we connected with a family friend, a neurosurgeon, who was honest with me and estimated that my wife would live two to four more years. This information allowed me to make life-altering decisions to take advantage of this short window (including an extended R.V. vacation with our three young kids) and prepare to say goodbye. She passed away just under three years from the diagnosis.I believe that doctors have a moral responsibility that goes beyond just doing everything in their power to achieve the best physical outcome for the patient. The doctor bears a responsibility to administer the medical truth of the situation.While it may cause some emotional turmoil, the patient deserves the chance to embrace the truth and take care of his or her affairs — relationally, financially and spiritually.Todd GaylordCharlotte, N.C.To the Editor:I admire Dr. Daniela J. Lamas’s candor in writing about the harm she did by telling a dying patient who was in denial about his condition that his death was imminent. This happens all too often as medical students and young physicians are told by their mentors about the duty to share prognoses, no matter how ominous, with their patients.While many, if not most, patients wish to hear the facts of their illness relayed in a sensitive and empathetic manner, a sizable minority of patients do not. Religious, cultural and psychological factors often influence a patient’s willingness to hear the unalloyed facts. They may want medical information screened through their families.While patients have a right to know, they also have a right not to know. And by telling patients in denial about their impending death — what they don’t want to hear — physicians may violate an ancient dictum of medical ethics: First, do no harm.Kenneth PragerNew YorkThe writer is a professor of medicine and director of clinical ethics at Columbia University Medical Center.To the Editor:In reading this essay, I thought about my interactions with my doctors since I was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. I recognize the difficulty of the doctor’s position in this situation. Human interactions are tricky regardless of one’s setting, but they are particularly delicate at the crossroads of life and death.One of the ways to provide the help and support that patients need is for the doctor to engage with the patient from a place of empathy and curiosity. I have learned to avoid asking questions that I am not prepared to process and to ask questions that will help me manage myself and my illness.The ideal doctor-patient relationship is a partnership in which I am encouraged to experience as much sense of agency as is possible in a situation in which so little is under my control.Giselle O. Martin-KniepNew YorkTo the Editor:As a hospice chaplain for over 15 years, I can relate to the conversation that Dr. Daniela J. Lamas relates. I learned that we tell the truth, but we don’t need to tell it with a sledgehammer. We meet people where they are in terms of their own perception of their illness and how we might help them in palliative care.Among many striking conversations, one that stands out was being invited to the home of a dying 5-year-old boy who had some resemblance to my own 5-year-old son. His angry mother greeted me at the door by saying that she would not welcome my visit if I would not join her in a prayer for healing — even in the face of this incurable illness. I told her that of course I would join her in that prayer.As my own eyes filled with tears as we held hands with her son, I had no trouble holding in mind the two thoughts that I would hope for this healing and yet know that his death appeared imminent. I could do this without duplicity or reservation.A few days later, she told us she did not want hospice care anymore. He died that week. I didn’t know if I could have done any better, but I hope that I gave her some measure of peace.Humbly, it still all remains a mystery.Dave PasinskiFayetteville, N.Y.To the Editor:Every doctor can sympathize with Dr. Daniela J. Lamas’s mea culpa for feeling she didn’t handle well the perpetual dilemma of terminal disease and professional frankness. Looking deeper, however, it seems that her dilemma was caused by failures elsewhere in the system.The patient “never responded” to calls to schedule lifesaving treatments? That’s it? He didn’t respond to calls, so not our problem? Where was his primary care doctor, if he had one, and if he didn’t, why not? A trusting relationship with a primary care doctor can make all the difference in getting patients to treatments. Where was the teamwork among medical professionals?Dr. Lamas’s anguish is understandable. Understanding the root cause of her dilemma might empower her and her colleagues to work to fix a faulty system.Budd N. ShenkinBerkeley, Calif.The writer is a retired pediatrician.To the Editor:There are many truths in caring for patients or loved ones at the end of life. The message we give must be sensitive to the patient’s story, including his place in his illness, his actions and his words. This man wanted to watch his ballgame and be relieved of his pain. It was not a matter of truth versus dishonesty.We cannot be certain of the moment we will die; he did not need to know she did not expect him to live more than a few hours. His denial should have been respected while his comfort was maximized.We have a duty to do no harm; we also have a duty not to let our personal feelings contradict the patient’s best interests.Miriam Piven CotlerRedondo Beach, Calif.The writer, a clinical ethicist, is professor emerita at California State University, Northridge.To the Editor:As a retired emergency room nurse, I wish more doctors would give terminal patients realistic information about when they might die, especially if it’s likely to be soon. I’ve seen hundreds of physicians give patients and their families false hope, perhaps to give them comfort. After the loved one had passed, the family feels sadness and regret because they could not prepare — but also shock, anger and betrayal. They feel that the doctors lied to them.Dr. Daniela J. Lamas writes that she feels guilty that she was truthful with her patient, but she allowed him to make decisions that may have been impossible had he thought he had more time. Gentle honesty is the only decent and respectful thing to do in such situations.Rachel BrooksPawleys Island, S.C.To the Editor:My heart ached as I read Dr. Daniela J. Lamas’s humble confession, because I, too, know the pain and shame of entering a patient’s room hellbent on breaking through their “impenetrable denial” with the unvarnished truth, and instead breaking their trust and our relationship.I humbly offer “3 E’s” that help me put on the brakes.
