Elimination refers to zero cases of COVID-19 in a particular geographic area, such as a country, while eradication refers to bringing the global burden of cases to zero, which would be extremely difficult to achieve. Exceptions to this mainly included such geographically isolated countries as New Zealand that have been able to drastically reduce COVID cases, which is not possible in other areas of the world; however, even in these situations, as borders reopen, there will likely be a resurgence.What does it take to get an infectious disease eliminated? There are four major principles to eliminate an infection within the human population:. A biologic intervention that prevents transmission of the disease in nearly all individuals, for example, a vaccine.. A diagnostic test that picks up the vast majority of, if not all, cases.. A surveillance system to detect cases as the disease nears elimination and afterwards to ensure there is no rebound.. No other place for this infection to hide, and then reinfect humans, such as an animal \"reservoir\" - a disease that exists naturally among animals and can be transmitted to humans cannot be eliminated by defeating it in human hosts alone.Smallpox fit the prototype of this model. A viral disease that led to a rash similar to chickenpox, smallpox caused significant suffering globally, leading to the death of up to 30 to 50 per cent of individuals affected. A significant reduction in the global burden of smallpox was due to the work of Edward Jenner, who derived the first vaccine from a related virus called cowpox (its scientific name was Vaccinia - the root word of the word \"vaccine\"). In the 1950s, through a global effort by the World Health Assembly, a smallpox eradication campaign took place. Two decades later, for the first time in recorded history, the world saw the eradication of an infectious disease.Based on the aforementioned four principles, smallpox was an ideal candidate for elimination and ultimately eradication. It had:. A biologic intervention - the vaccine that not only prevented disease, but lessened symptoms in those who developed the disease, which in turn led to a decrease in transmissibility.. A diagnostic test - the characteristic rash in nearly all individuals.. A surveillance system set up looking for hot spots and ongoing transmission after elimination.. It could only infect humans. There were no other animal reservoirs.Edward Jenner, who derived a vaccine for smallpox from a related virus called cowpox, is seen in a portrait by John Raphael Smith.So how does COVID-19 measure up when considering the principles of elimination?We do not yet have biologic interventions in place to prevent transmission of the disease. Our most effective method of preventing infection is physical distancing. This may change, but there's no vaccine yet. Our diagnostic test by nasopharyngeal swab picks up most cases but not all of them. Surveillance can pick up symptomatic cases but given the presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission of this disease (which can comprise up to 25 to 30 per cent of cases), it is unable to pick up a significant proportion of cases prior to spread. Animals, thankfully, do not play a role in human transmission, however there are non-human animals who can get infected - cats, dogs, and mink for example, and there is at least the potential for these animals to transmit to humans. Given the global burden of COVID-19, even if a single area of the world were to eliminate the disease, it would be very likely to be reintroduced once travel resumes, as was seen recently in New Zealand.Clearly, this is a challenge.Even if elimination is not feasible, in the pre-vaccine era we should continue our efforts to prevent the spread of disease within our communities with well established public-health measures, such as physical distancing, hand hygiene, and masking in indoor enclosed settings. However, we can expect intermittent spread throughout our communities for an indeterminate amount of time, and if a vaccine does not provide high-level immunity, there is a possibility of long-term transmission. Future clusters of cases should not be considered failures, as long as they are managed appropriately with early identification, case and contact tracing, and root cause analysis of the factors involved in transmission. In working towards creating testing capacity, early identification of case clusters will help to reduce the risk of sustained community transmission.A worker places wooden crosses at a burial site for victims of the COVID-19 coronavirus at Keputih cemetery in Surabaya, East Java, on July 15, 2020.We need to focus our efforts on clinical trials of interventions to prevent infection, and to reduce the morbidity and mortality of the disease, thereby improving our ability to live with COVID-19. We must focus on preventing transmission amongst our most vulnerable and within congregate living settings. Once interventions come, we should focus our efforts on alleviating the suffering from this disease globally.As infectious diseases physicians, we feel it is warranted to be honest with the population and caution against using the term \"elimination\" or \"eradication\" in the context of this disease and alleviate some of the anxiety and sense of failure with case counts ongoing in the community. We need to focus on using the correct language of containment, reduction and risk mitigation as part of the discussion moving forward, rather than elimination or eradication.Dr. Zain Chagla is an associate professor at McMaster University and infectious diseases consultant at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton.
