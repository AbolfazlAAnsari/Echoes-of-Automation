What no Brexiteer has ever been able or willing to explain is if world trade terms are so wonderful, why is it every country capable of doing so seeks to negotiate \"better terms\" in trade treaties with its peers?As political rogues throughout history have always done, Brexiteers have wrapped themselves in the national flag and gulled the nation into the delusion that they can \"take back control\". As Samuel Johnson pithily observed, \"patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel\". It is hard to imagine a bigger bunch of scoundrels than those currently leading us into the brave new world of broken treaties, weakened service industries, and a disintegrating union.Robin J BulowClacton-on-SeaNegotiation charadeBoris Johnson has said that a no-deal Brexit would be a good outcome for Britain. If this is the case why on earth bother with the charade of negotiations at all? Something isn't really credible in this claim.Johnson is as mendacious as Trump, inventing a new reality for every scenario, justifying every error and whitewashing all risks that his own incompetence creates.Trump was right. Johnson really is just a UK version of himself.Simon CarrelMaidenheadRead moreState aid rules matter, but they are not the threat to British sovereignty that David Frost claimsNever mind a 'divorce' from the EU - Brexit will turn into a cold warBrexit: Boris Johnson risks collapse of EU talks with controversial new plan to 'rip up' parts of withdrawal agreementUK will walk out of Brexit trade talks if no deal by mid-October, Boris Johnson says"
