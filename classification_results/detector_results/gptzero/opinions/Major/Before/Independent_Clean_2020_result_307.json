And everyone I know, of my generation, does not want to be \"saved\" while younger generations suffer.Since the problem is in hospitals and treating those who get the disease severely, that is where all the efforts and resources should go, and not in incarcerating the whole population. I fully understand the issue of the disease spreading, but it will, whatever governments do. The downsides of lockdowns are far too serious now.I am powerless in this situation. No one is listening to people like me. And Brexit now, too (which I didn't vote for). All very depressing.Alison ParkerCanterburyGood riddance, Mike PompeoThe outgoing secretary of state Mike Pompeo is considering classifying any criticism of Israel's war crimes as antisemitic. So it will be an offence to support human rights and international law. The new plan will equate any criticism of Israel with antisemitism as an attempt to silence pro-Palestinian advocates. That takes a very twisted mind to come up with such a plan.Pompeo's plan will affect NGOs like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch by cutting their funding. Other pro-Palestinian organisations abroad will also be targeted. Pompeo needs to educate himself on the US Constitution because his plan infringes on people's right to freedom of expression. I am even surprised yet that there is no outcry from the defender of free speech.Rabbi Alissa Wise, deputy director of Jewish Voice for Peace, summed up the plan in one sentence: \"This would be a disaster for Palestinians, the Palestinian rights movement, and all those endangered by white nationalism and real antisemitism.\"Thankfully, Secretary Pompeo will be leaving his post in less than 100 days.Mahmoud El-YoussephWesterville, OhioRead MoreNo, Dominic Cummings did not win the election for Boris JohnsonTories disown Dominic Cummings amid hope for 'reset' at No 10I would bet we haven't seen the last of Dominic CummingsPompeo heads to Europe, Mideast"
