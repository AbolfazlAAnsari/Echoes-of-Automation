The cautious centrist Joe Biden has failed to trump the unashamedly crowd-pleasing populist. Today Mr Trump stands on the brink of an incredible political comeback, with perhaps only Pennsylvania and 3 million postal votes between him and returning to the White House. Mr Biden has to take that state, or Arizona, or Georgia, and hold on in Michigan and Wisconsin. The brinkmanship has begun, with Mr Biden speaking early yesterday to pre-empt the quick declaration of victory by Mr Trump. The President says the Democrats are just trying to steal the election, and he will go to the Supreme Court if he is not winning. Whoever takes the presidency, this election portends a crisis of legitimacy, where only minorities of either party accept a winner from the other, stretching America's cohesion even further.The turnout has been huge, with 100 million voters pre-polling, and Americans determined to get out in exceptional numbers to cast their votes. The election reverted to a referendum on Mr Trump. And that is with the sobering reality of a virus that has infected 9.2 million Americans and taken 231,000 lives, with Mr Trump's clear mishandling of the pandemic making Mr Biden the favourite to win. It will come down to whether Mr Trump can now thread the needle in the rust-belt states, much as he did in 2016.The recriminations within the Democratic Party will be deep, whatever happens. The party's small-target campaigning, while Mr Trump shrugged off the virus, and then stormed around the country drumming up votes, has turned out to be ill-judged. Even if he does not win, the fact the President has outperformed expectations will entrench Trumpist populist nationalism as the creed of the Republicans. The important restraint for politics in the next four years will be the Senate, where the Republicans look to be losing their dominance, while the Democrats may not have the numbers to end the filibuster. That will limit the damage either occupant of the White House could do.Had the election been run in March, Mr Trump's success would not have surprised. He has steadily polled ahead of Mr Biden on the economy. He runs as an anti-politician, out to drain the swamp of crooked insiders, but he has never scored more than 47 per cent in national approval ratings. Yet in exit polls yesterday, one-third of voters said the economy was the most important issue for them. Only two in 10 said they were concerned about the virus, and a similar number mentioned race and identity politics. That is a stunning setback for Mr Biden and even more for his party. The election may have been tilted in places like Florida's Dade County, where Mr Trump's macho anti-socialism swayed voters of Cuban descent more than the rainbow politics of the Democrats. But Mr Trump also seems to have swung key North Carolina in a county where Native Americans are in majority. The electoral path is twisty indeed.Mr Trump's modus operandi has been grievance and division. In 2016 he was the surprise package, and the more bombs he threw at institutions or even common decency, the more he channelled the ignored heartland voters who felt they were finally being heard.
