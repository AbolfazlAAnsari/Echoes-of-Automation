I am curious, though. India has overtaken Brazil, which is firmly on the travel \"red list\". Why is India not on this list? Is this criminal negligence on the part of the government, or is it criminal intent? I understand that Boris Johnson wishes to visit soon.Gunter StraubLondon N3Unclear dataWe are told that vaccines can protect 95 per cent of recipients but we are not told anything about who they do not protect. Before the vaccination programme started, about 2 per cent of those testing positive died. Would a vaccine have protected 95 per cent of them or would they all have been in the 5 per cent not protected by a vaccine? The former would be fantastic news; the latter would mean that the vulnerable are not protected by a vaccine and still need to shield - something the government stopped advising at the end of March.The published figures show mortality has in fact reduced by about 75 per cent, not 95 per cent. This needs to be adjusted for the fact that older people are currently a smaller proportion of the people testing positive, the reduction is perhaps half, so the vaccine protection of the vulnerable could be about 50 per cent rather than 95 per cent.The government should have very detailed data and should know exactly what protection the vaccine is giving the vulnerable. They must tell us. They should be seeking tests of antibodies that identify who has failed to be protected by a vaccine.The government is not planning to eliminate infections. They want to relax social distancing and rely on vaccination to limit the level of infections within the capacity of the NHS. The vulnerable who are not protected need know they are not in order to protect themselves by shielding.Jon HawksleyLondon EC1Oscars have forgotten film fansJames Moore's excellent article on movie piracy ('It's easy to see why piracy thrives when Oscar movies are released to a privileged few', 17 April) did make me reminisce. For many years, we would hold Oscars nights and for the most part we would have seen all of the nominated films. This added to the excitement of the evening. It all worked well and was good publicity for the movie industry keeping its fan base happy.More and more now - granted the pandemic has exacerbated this - awards ceremonies are elitist and meaningless for movie fans. If we keep heading down this road, sadly it is inevitable we will just stop watching them altogether.Paul MorrisonGlasgowBaroness Shirley WilliamsWe were living in Hitchin while the late Shirley Williams was the local MP, and our daughter attended the excellent girls' grammar school there. At a parents' evening that had been called to protest against plans to turn the school into a comprehensive, which Williams was strenuously advocating, I asked her why she was so much in favour of such a plan although she sent her own daughter to a private school. She replied that as a parent she had to do what she thought was best for her child, but as a politician she had to do what she thought was best for the country.My opinion of Baroness Williams was always flavoured by that remark.Elizabeth WilkinsColwyn Bay, WalesRead MoreIf we have moral corruption in the highest office, what hope is there?There's a magic money tree for NHS operations, but not pay rises?A truly dismal end to America's longest war"
