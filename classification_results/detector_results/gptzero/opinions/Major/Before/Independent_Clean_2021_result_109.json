The presence of risk factors for venous or arterial thromboembolism (including older age) would be considered as contraindications to hormonal contraception.Giuseppe Enrico BignardiDurhamTeenager disappearanceWhen London teenager Richard Okorogheye went missing at the end of March his distraught mother went to the police for help and was cruelly rebuffed: \"I told a police officer that my son was missing, please can you help me find him and she said 'if you can't find your son, how do you expect police officers to find your son for you?'\"Two weeks days later came the terrible news that a body matching Richard's description had been found in Epping Forest.We will never know if Richard's life could have been saved if the police had taken his disappearance more seriously.The government shouldn't be making statements like \"Institutional racism doesn't exist in the UK\".Sasha SimicLondonRead more:•The climate crisis is a bigger emergency than the national deficit•Colonial mindset is behind France's latest attempt to ban the hijab•Dear NICE, some thoughts on your guidance for chronic pain sufferersThe climate crisis is a bigger emergency than the national deficitColonial mindset is behind France's latest attempt to ban the hijabDear NICE, some thoughts on your guidance for chronic pain sufferersGetting Brexit doneTwenty-three years ago I welcomed the Good Friday Agreement, particularly the principle of equal respect of all traditions and that any change to the constitution of Northern Ireland had to be approved by all communities.The protest over the last few nights, partly related to Brexit, did not surprise me as peace was only possible because of the single market that removed the border.Brexit and the return of a border may not be the sole motivation of the people attacking the police; feeling ignored, being poor with little hope of change could also have played a part leading them to despair. It was irresponsible of Sinn Fein and showed poor leadership on Covid-19 for senior members to attend an IRA funeral illegal under Covid-19 regulations, and it was wrong of the Police Service of Northern Ireland not to prosecute those who broke those regulations in the same way as they might prosecute young loyalists who breach these regulations.Could I suggest that Sinn Fein's deputy first minister Michelle O'Neill, finance minister Conor Murphy and other senior party members who broke the regulations show real leadership and report themselves to PSNI for breach of Covid-19 regulations, accept their punishment and show all, including young loyalists, that everyone is equal under the law and law and politics provides the best way forward?Prime Minister Boris Johnson also has a responsibility to sort out the problems his desperation to become PM and then to get Brexit done has caused, and start looking at rejoining the European Customs Union or the single market, removing any need for a border. I'm sure the UK fishing industry, farmers and small exporters would also welcome the removal of unnecessary borders and getting business back to normal.John SimpsonRoss-on-WyeHairdresser chatThe most exciting news of the coming days?Hairdressers will reopen on 12 April.I wonder what the conversation starters will be now, since the favourite opening line, \"Are you going anywhere nice for your holidays?\" is sadly so irrelevant.Perhaps, \"Have you had your vaccine yet?\", \"What background do you use for your Zoom calls?\" or \"Have you bought any new houseplants recently?\" will top the icebreaker questions.Judi MartinScotlandSide-effectsI think we need an intensiveOxford-AstraZeneca vaccine marketingand advertising campaign or we run the risk of people not taking up their jab.With the stats massively favouring vaccination we need to get this message across to the public. The blood clotting risk if you get the AZ jab is 0.0004 per cent. The risks to us after we have contracted Covid, however, are significantly higher: clotting on the lungs 7.8 per cent, clotting in the legs 11.2 per cent, strokes occur in 1.2 per cent of cases, even more common is the lowering of the platelet count in 30 per cent of cases.Of course, we also have the 150,000 deaths and many others have to deal with long Covid. So we should be able to use this data to convince younger people to get vaccinated. I don't often agree with Jeremy Hunt but he was right when he said on Channel 4 news that \"no medicine is 100 per cent immune to side-effects\".Paul MorrisonGlasgowBearer of good newsI read Andrew Grice's column (The vaccine isn't the route to normality the PM promised) with interest. I too watched the Easter Monday briefing and I agree that Boris Johnson was opaque and many of his assertions were caveated. Of course one might say Boris Johnson has woken up and smelt the coffee and is hesitant about overpromising and then subsequently having to backtrack ignominiously.He is though still in thrall to his gung-ho libertarian backbenchers who demand that life returns to normal at the speed of light. Admittedly, this is a delicate balancing act with the vaccine rollout hitting a not unusual \"bump in the road\" but with the perilous situation in Europe, Johnson can for once see the writing on the wall that mass opening up could indeed lead to a further Covid-19 wave in the summer. But interpreting that message into a balanced \"wait and see\" modus operandi before going full steam ahead is seemingly beyond his natural default mechanism of wanting and desperate to be the bearer of good news, which in itself is an inherent fault in any prime minister and especially in these still dangerous pandemic times.Judith A DanielsNorfolkRead MoreProtester doesn't recognise Rhianna as she gives him her Instagram handleWhat's after flags?
