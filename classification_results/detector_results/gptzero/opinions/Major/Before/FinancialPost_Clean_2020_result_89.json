Consequently, the project to develop and produce it ran into recurrent cost and schedule overruns, technical difficulties and contract disputes, undermining the reputations of multiple governments for sound stewardship of public resources.Test pilots carry out pre-flight checks in a CH-148 Cyclone Flight Simulator at the Sikorsky Maritime Helicopter Training Centre at 12 Wing Shearwater, N.S., on June 4, 2015.While political manipulation of the process for analyzing and defining military requirements is, thankfully, relatively rare, when it happens it is very costly on many levels (witness the current dragged-out fighter replacement program). Why it persists at all is very difficult to understand, since the potential political rewards from making half-baked election commitments in the defence and security area are so small in the first place. Few, if any, Canadians cast their votes based on these considerations, and the risks of bad political outcomes are so great that it is, frankly, a stupid and pointless risk to take. Parties would be far better served by building their defence and national security election promises on analytical and intellectual foundations that are as sound as those of their economic and fiscal policies.How would voters know if they had done so? First, party platforms and promises would not talk about buying or not buying specific systems or products. The drafters of these commitments can't possibly do the depth of analysis of operational, technical, financial, economic and other factors that must go into deciding the best solution for Canada, so voters should steer away from these kinds of poorly considered promises and look instead for party platforms that explain their broader approaches to safeguarding Canada's security, engaging with the rest of the world, and managing the acquisition and support of the associated resources.Second, parties would commit to placing the defence and security of Canada above partisan politics and work to build a more enduring political consensus around defence and national security policy, as is done in other Western democracies such as Australia and most European nations. Defence and security investments typically take years or decades to plan and implement, so decisions taken by past governments have largely shaped the options the current government has to act on. Today's decisions will similarly shape the options of multiple future governments. This means that it is in political parties' long-term interests to bring to an end the uniquely Canadian wasteful gamesmanship around the acquisition of these important national capabilities. The fact that doing so would also very much be in the national interest would make it a win-win for everyone.Charles Davies is a retired military officer and former strategic planning director for the Materiel Group of the Department of National Defence.Richard Shimooka: It's an increasingly unstable world out there.
