Meanwhile, CDC data shows us thatmore than 8,000have developed a related, severe inflammatory condition known as MIS-C,more than 1,200have died, and last winter's spike in youth hospitalizations wasdriven bychildren who were too young to be vaccinated andolder childrenwho could have been vaccinated but were not. More than5 millionof the 13 million total infections have occurred in 2022 alone, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the goodAs the virus has adapted, our current vaccines have becomeless effectiveat preventing Omicron-related infections, includingamong kids. However, Covid-19 vaccines prevent the worst outcomes: Researchersestimatethat these vaccines saved more than 1 million lives in the United States during their first year. They continue toprovide childrenwith strong protection against hospitalization and death, with adverse reactionsexceedingly rare.While we don't yet have the full analysis on efficacy and safety data for vaccines for our youngest children, early results are promising, according toPfizerandModerna. If the FDA's and CDC's independent advisory groups determine that children under 5 should receive vaccination protection, we should follow their recommendations.No one should have to choose between vaccinating children and receiving a paycheckAny successful vaccination campaign must pair a strong supply with easy access, yet parents of children ages 5-11reportsignificant barriers: Thirty-five percent are concerned about taking time off work to get children vaccinated or staying home with them afterward, 25% are concerned about vaccines not being available in a trusted place and 19% are concerned about traveling to a clinic, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF).Parents not being able to take time off is a costly hindrance to kids' vaccine access, but the United States continues to remain alone among wealthy nations in offering no national paid leave program.Only 10 stateshave their own, and only 14 require employers to include care for a child in paid sick programs.Many workers in low-paying jobsdo not receive a single paid sick day. Expanding paid sick and family medical leave must be a national priority.Parents are seeking vaccination information from trusted sourcesMore than twice as many parents of children under 5plan to\"wait and see\" (38%) versus getting their children vaccinated right away (18%), according to KFF polling released in early May. Thismirrors trendsseen among parents of older children. That is understandable. Unfortunately, misinformation is easy to find: KFF pollingshows thatnearly 80% of adults have heard at least one myth about Covid-19 vaccines -- such as that they cause death or lead to infertility -- and either say it is true or are unsure if it is false.Doctors, pediatricians and local health departments are among themost trusted sourcesfor accurate vaccine information. They should address questions and concerns with empathy and thoughtfulness. And, if parents ultimately decide to vaccinate their children, the steps necessary to maintain a sustained and equitable rollout -- such as bringing vaccines directly to underserved schools and communities, ensuring appointments after hours and on weekends, and permitting walk-in visits for those who cannot make appointments -- should continue to be prioritized.Children ultimately depend on adults for any vaccination protection they receive. For older children already eligible for primary vaccination and boosters, parents should prioritize vaccination now. And, if safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines are authorized for our youngest children, I hope that parents will prioritize this protection for them and that our policies make it possible for them to do so. By following these principles, every family can make the right call about Covid-19 vaccines.Opinion by Julie MoritaTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved."
