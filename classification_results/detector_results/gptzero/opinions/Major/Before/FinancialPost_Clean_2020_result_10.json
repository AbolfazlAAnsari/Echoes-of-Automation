Before rushing to satisfy the demands for more open access to MAID, Parliament should pause and consider what trajectory we are on and whether there is a better way to respond to the increasingly common requests for state-sponsored suicide.Our nation has three options. First, respond to requests for medically assisted suicide as we would to all others who want to end their own life: offering support, care, and suicide prevention. Second, allow MAID in very limited situations, such as when people are suffering and near death. Third, show total deference for human autonomy by allowing MAID for anyone who wants to end their life.Before the Supreme Court of Canada's 2015 Carter decision allowing assisted suicide, Parliament overwhelmingly defeated more than a dozen bills that would have legalized the practice, maintaining that life is sacred and the right to life can't be extinguished, even if someone doesn't think their own life is worth living. Although Parliament passed Bill C-14 in response to the Carter decision, thinking it could follow option two, the fact that Parliament is already broadening MAID proves that it is quickly sliding to option three.Our Liberal government accepted the Quebec judge's decision that we should allow doctors to kill people who are not dying. The Ministry of Justice explained that the government \"will expand eligibility for MAID beyond people who are nearing the end of life, and could possibly also result in other changes once the review is complete.\"Parliament had good reason to include the \"reasonably foreseeable natural death\" restriction, and the previous Liberal government itself championed its passage. So it is striking that the government did not defend Parliament's law by appealing the Quebec judge's ruling.

How can we justify not extending assisted suicide to those whose suffering is psychological, or to teens or children, or to someone whose only reason for MAID is that they are tired of living?
