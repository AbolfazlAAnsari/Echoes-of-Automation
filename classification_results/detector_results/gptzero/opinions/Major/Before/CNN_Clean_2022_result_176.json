            "inputText": "May 22 is \"Sherlock Holmes Day,\" honoring the birthday of his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Holmes, who turns 135 this year, is one of the most famous literary characters in the world and probably the most famous detective.He's come to be referenced as a historical figure rather than a fictional one (often at the expense of his actual author), with countless legends surrounding him. Perhaps the most popular is that he invented modern forensic science.This particular aspect of Holmes lore has beenaddressedinarticles,books,documentaries, andcollege coursesand is evencited by forensic experts. But is it really true? Did Sherlock Holmes (meaning Doyle) invent crime-solving methods like fingerprinting and blood testing years and even decades before law enforcement?If he did, it would mean that, aside from entertaining generations of readers and viewers and inspiring dozens of other popular characterslike BatmanandHouse, M.D., he also deserves credit for helping solve thousands, if not millions, of crimes in the real world.The origin of Holmes' forensic expertiseIn his very first story, 1887's \"A Study in Scarlet,\" Doyledescribes Holmes as\"well up in anatomy, and ... a first-class chemist,\" who \"has never taken out any systematic medical classes\" but has nonetheless \"amassed a lot of ... knowledge which would astonish his professors.\" Holmes didn't have official forensic training simply because there was none; thefirst forensic science programwas established at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1909.Where Holmes did get his prodigious medical knowledge was from his creator. Doylewas a practicing ophthalmologist who wrote as a hobby, much like Holmes' partner and chronicler, Dr. Watson.Holmes is also based on a real physician,Dr. Joseph Bell, amentor of Doyle'sat the University of Edinburgh, who had evenassisted police in murder investigations. In 1892, Doylewroteto Bell: \"It is most certainly to you that I owe Sherlock Holmes ... I do not think that his analytical work is in the least an exaggeration of some effects which I have seen you produce in the out patient ward.\"At a time when solving crimes mostly consisted of collecting eyewitness accounts and rounding up the usual suspects (often to coerce a confession), Doyle imported themethodical examination and evidence-based deduction of medicineto police work.Holmes didn't invent the idea of using science to solve crimes, buthe did popularize it.Holmes' magnifying glassOf the various forensic techniques attributed to Holmes, the most famous isthe use of a magnifying glass. It's as much a part of his iconic image as the deerstalker cap and calabash pipe.It's first mentioned in \"A Study in Scarlet,\" which does markthe first time a magnifying glass is usedin a work of fiction to examine a crime scene, even though magnifying glasses in different formshad been around for centuries.It's unclear whether magnifying glasses were used in investigative fieldwork before then, but Sir Sydney Smith (1883-1969), professor of forensic medicine and dean of medicine at the University of Edinburgh and one of the world's preeminent forensic experts,creditedHolmes with the idea.Blood testingAlso in \"A Study in Scarlet,\" Holmesdeclares: \"I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by hoemoglobin, and by nothing else ... it gives us an infallible test for blood stains ... The old guaiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old.\"Holmes's discovery does predate the first reliable blood test in real life by more than a decade, either theUhlenhuth Testcreated in 1900 or theKastle Meyer Testcreated in 1903.Holmes is right that theGuaiacum Test-- invented in 1864, using tree resin acid toturn bloodstains blue-- is inconclusive, but it is fairly accurate and in fact, still used today.In truth, theTeichmann Testhad been in use since 1853, aconclusive test based on microcrystal formationin reaction to hemoglobin. This is presumably the microscopic examination Holmes was referring to. While it does require a microscope and is not conducted on-scene, and bloodstains that are insoluble or diffused can result in a false negative, Holmes was wrong that the test is only effective for fresh blood. It's beensuccessfully used to identify stains as old as 20 years.Blood could not be accurately matched to an individualuntil DNA profiling was created in 1984andfirst used forensically in 1986.The reality of fingerprintsHolmes is also credited as a pioneer offingerprint analysis, first referenced in 1890's\"The Sign of the Four,\"more than a decade before Scotland Yard fully used them.While that's technically true,the British had been usinghandprints in Bengal, India, since 1858 as an alternative to locals' signatures. Usinghand and finger impressions for personal identificationdates back to ancient Mesopotamia, and as a way toidentify perpetrators of crimesto at least 300 BCE China.American science journals proposed using prints found at crime scenesto identify suspects as early as 1877, and in 1880, Henry Faulds, a Scottish physician working in Japan,used fingerprints to identify a burglar, writing about the case later that yearin the British journal \"Nature,\"which Doyle was a reader of.Doyle wasn't even the first to write about it in fiction. Mark Twain beat him to it in1883's \"Life on the Mississippi,\"where a murderer is identified using a bloody thumbprint, and in 1884's\"The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson,\"in which a lawyer uses methodical fingerprinting to solve a murder and prove it in court.That said, thefirst real-life murder case to be solved using fingerprintswasn't until 1892 in Necochea, Argentina. Scotland Yard only began employing a rudimentary fingerprint system in 1894, and only as an auxiliary to anthropometrics, which identified criminals by physical characteristics like skull width and foot length. Fingerprinting becamestandard practice in England in 1901and was first presented in court a year later.The first fingerprinting unit in the US wasestablished in New York in 1903, spreading to the rest of the country following asuccessful demonstration at the 1904 World's Fair.Thefirst criminal trialto present fingerprint evidence was in 1910.Examining documents as evidenceWhether Holmes was the first to identify a culprit throughtypewritten document examinationis harder to answer.In 1891's \"A Case of Identity,\" he matches the keystrokes on a typed letter sent by his suspect to letters sent by the criminal,stating that\"a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting.\"This technically predates the earliest professional text to reference typewriting identification, 1894's\"Disputed Handwriting,\"as well as thefirst trial to hear expert testimony on typewriting, provided by a typewriter repairman, in 1893. But typewriting analysis was allowed in US courts even before then, and by the 1890s it was common enough thatseveral technical manuals were written, even if not by forensic experts.Still, Holmes was at least an early adopter. He alsomuses aboutwriting a monograph \"on the typewriter and its relation to crime,\"  years before the first comprehensive text on the subject, 1910's\"Forensic Document Examination.\"The FBI didn't establish adocument section until 1932andthe Scotland Yard until 1935.Preserving the crime sceneHolmes isoften creditedas the first to recognize the importanceof crime scene preservation, and quite rightly.In several stories, he comments on the need to record and conserve anything found at a crime scene, no matter how small or trivial. In 1891's \"The Boscombe Valley Mystery,\" he bemoans the contamination of a crime scene by a search party's footprints,noting\"how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it.\"During the Victorian era,crime scenes were recognized as such, particularly in murders, and they were examined by police inspectors and sometimes a pathologist or local doctor. But there wasno protocol, no awareness of trace or latent evidence and no imperative to protect the scene from tainting.Thefirst forensic manual, \"The Washing Away of Wrongs,\"was published in 1247 China. The first requirement topresent (and so preserve) medical evidence in murder caseswas in 1507 Germany. Thefirst guidelines in Englandfor observing and collecting facts in a crime scene were included, briefly, in an 1844 King's College manual, \"Principles of Forensic Medicine.\"It wasn't until Hans Gross, an Austrian judge and criminalist, published his influential \"Handbook for Criminal Investigators\" in 1893, considered the first systematization of crime investigation, that it wasput in official writing: \"Never alter the position of, pick up, or even touch any object before it has been minutely described in the report.\"Though Gross' handbook postdates Holmes,there's no evidenceto support the popular claimthat he was directly inspired by him -- or vice versa. What's more likely is that Gross and Doyle, both medically trained men at the cusp of the age of science, arrived at the approach concurrently.What's the verdict?The claim that Sherlock Holmes invented modern forensics is highly exaggerated, but it's not completely untrue.Doyle applied the scientific method to detective work before the police did as a whole, and in several instances pioneered concepts and techniques ahead of their time. But the turn of the last century was an era of rapid advancement in science, technology and medicine, and Holmes embodied its spirit. He had the benefit to practice in fiction what was still theoretical in reality, and his innovations often shortly preceded their real-life equivalents.What's fair to say is that Sherlock Holmes was indeed a significant influence on the field of forensic science. He made its ideas accessible to the masses, popularized it as a unified field of knowledge, and inspired generations of criminal justice professionals who went on to solve crimes and save lives.
