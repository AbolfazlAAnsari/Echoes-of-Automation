People’s memories are short, and they are susceptible to immediate cultural fears, ignoring the roots of those fears in previous administrations.And people are swayed by their perception of a strong, charismatic leader. In Donald Trump Republicans have such a leader, but at the moment the Democrats have no one to match him. It’s a sad and ominous time for the Democrats and for the country.Tim ShawCambridge, Mass.Don’t Exploit the CosmosTo the Editor:Re “A New 10-Year Plan for the Cosmos” (Out There, Science Times, Nov. 9):The seduction of finding other life and habitable planets in outer space has impelled good science. But until we reject exploration in service of exploitation (of other lives and all of nature), it will be another dead end for our rapacious and irresponsible species.We respect neither our neighbors nor our home planet, and we’re already filling space with our garbage. I don’t see taking this bad show on the interstellar road.Annlinn KrugerBar Harbor, MaineReligious Exemptions for VaccinesTo the Editor:Re “A Dangerous Supreme Court Fight Over Vaccine Mandates Looms,” by Wendy Parmet (Opinion guest essay, Nov. 1):Vaccine refusals risk lives, both those of the refusers and of those they might infect. The debate over religious exemptions to vaccine mandates, therefore, compels a value choice. Either religious freedom or protection of human life can prevail, but not both.If the Supreme Court were to rule eventually that Covid vaccine mandates must include religious exemptions, the justices will have made their choice, and it would not be one that puts “pro life” values at the top.Robert I.
