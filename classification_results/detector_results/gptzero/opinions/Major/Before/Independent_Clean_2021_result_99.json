One is of a white governor signing the law while surrounded by five white GOP officials and the other is of a black lawmaker being dragged by several white sheriff's deputies while she is in handcuffs.Before the Peach State and the rest of the south rise again, they should start first by rising aboveracism, bigotry, and intolerance. Georgia's new voting law is un-American.Mahmoud El-YoussephOhioBreak for shop workersRetail staff have worked extremely hard to keep the country fed.With this in mind, the retail companies would gain a lot of respect by wholly closing their doors on Easter Sunday to allow retail workers and their families to celebrate Easter, reflect, and just chill out. Not just the supermarkets as required by law but also the chains of small shops and online deliveries. And to do so across the United Kingdom as a whole.This also makes commercial sense as more goods would be bought before a whole one day closure.A win win.John BarstowSussex"
