Resources Minister Keith Pitt recently said(https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/australia-could-send-extra-gas-to-europe-as-russia-cuts-supplies-due-to-ukraine-tensions) his country is \"a leading and reliable global exporter of LNG\" and stands ready to assist with further supplies. And Qatar and Japan(https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/japan-diverting-lng-europe-some-already-route-industry-minister-2022-02-09/) are also seizing the opportunity, eyeing an increase of LNG exports to Europe.Yet despite Canada's world-class gas reserves, Canadian producers have not stepped up to export desperately needed natural gas to Europe. Why?The answer is simple but astonishing: despite producing(https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/nrcan/files/energy/energy_fact/2021-2022/PDF/2021_Energy-factbook_december23_EN_accessible.pdf) 16.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas every day - five per cent of the world's total - Canada does not have any LNG export facilities. According to Natural Resources Canada(https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/our-natural-resources/energy-sources-distribution/clean-fossil-fuels/natural-gas/canadian-lng-projects/5683), 18 LNG export facility projects have been proposed in Canada since 2011 (specifically, 13 in British Columbia, two in Quebec and three in Nova Scotia). But only one export facility is under construction (in B.C.). By comparison, between 2014 and 2020 the U.S. built(https://www.ferc.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/LNG_Maps_Exports-9-17-2020.pdf) seven LNG export facilities and approved 20 more, with five currently under construction).Mark Milke: Let's end magical thinking on energy(https://financialpost.com/opinion/mark-milke-lets-end -magical-thinking-on-energy )Jack Mintz: Time to put security into ESG(https://financialpost.com/opinion/jack-mintz-time-to-put-security-into-esg)Terence Corcoran: Putin blows up NetZero and the green reset(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-putin-blows-up-netzero-and-the-green-reset)Bjorn Lomborg: If you think today's energy prices are high, wait until net-zero(https://financialpost.com/opinion/bjorn-lomborg-if-you-think-todays-energy-prices-are-high-wait-until-net-zero)The culprit? Canada's arduous regulatory system and fierce opposition from interest groups have together led to the cancellation of several critical LNG projects. For example, in 2017, oil and gas company Petronas cancelled(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/pacific-northwest-lng-delays-petronas-1.4352004) its $36-billion Pacific NorthWest LNG project due to \"delays and long regulatory timelines\" coupled with poor market conditions. In 2020, Warren Buffet pulled(https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/warren-buffett-reportedly-pulls-out-of-lng-project-in-quebec-due-to-challenges-in-canada) out of a proposed $9-billion LNG project in Quebec amid concerns over regulatory challenges and railway blockades. Last year, joint venture partners Chevron and Woodside Energy stated(https://vancouversun.com/news/australian-energy-giant-woodside-petroleum-wants-out-of-troubled-kitimat-lng-project) their intention to sell their shares of the Kitimat LNG project in northern B.C. after more than a decade of slow progress.Strong environmental protections are necessary, of course. Canadians demand responsible stewardship of the environment. But excessive regulatory barriers and opposition to energy infrastructure have hurt our LNG industry and in so doing have contributed to higher global emissions. China - a potential customer for Canadian LNG - is burning coal for power generation at staggering rates. Coal is more emissions-intensive than LNG. If we had the export capacity to ship Canadian LNG to China, world greenhouse gas emissions could be lower as a result.Canada's glaring inability to export natural gas both to its European allies and to Asian coal users should be a wake-up call for governments across the country to ease regulations for energy infrastructure projects. We're missing an opportunity to benefit Canadians, our allies and the environment: win-win-win.Elmira Aliakbari and Jairo Yunis are analysts at the Fraser Institute. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
