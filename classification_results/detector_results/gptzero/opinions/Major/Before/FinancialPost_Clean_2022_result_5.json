            "inputText": "By Drs. Alanna Golden and Martha FulfordOntario has faced longer school closures than any other province in Canada, and any other jurisdiction in North America for that matter. On Dec. 30, Dr. Kieran Moore addressed the province and confirmed that students would be returning to in-person learning on Jan. 5. The chief medical officer stated, \"Schools are critical to the positive mental health and academic success of our children.\" A mere four days later, Premier Doug Ford overrode this decision and called for schools to once again be shuttered. This was not the first time that parents were falsely reassured that schools would be the last facilities to be closed and the first to be opened, yet here we are again, amidst the fourth provincial school closure, with non-essential services remaining open while schools are closed. Parents have yet again been left scrambling to make childcare arrangements (at significant personal or financial cost) or to take time off work as a result of changes in decision-making at the eleventh hour. Will the promised opening date of Jan. 17 be honoured this time around?Ontarians have been convinced that there is scientific justification for school closures - that there is something uniquely unsafe about Ontario schools - when the literature and real-world data, from jurisdictions where schools have remained open, tell us quite the opposite. It has been estimated that Omicron is at least 50 per cent less virulent(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.21.21268116v1) than prior variants, with at least 50 per cent of hospital admissions occurring in patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 but who were admitted to hospital for other reasons(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122101256X). Children without significant underlying medical(https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/38/E1483) conditions seldom become seriously ill with COVID-19, and even less with Omicron; most will be asymptomatic or have mild illness. The risk of severe complications such as MIS-C(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/article-abstract/2780861) is low, and persistent symptoms(https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext) following COVID-19 infection are comparable to that of other common viral illnesses seen in children. Schools have never been shown to be amplifiers of transmission and instead mirror what is happening in communities. Most infections coming into schools are from household or community contacts, with school-acquired cases(https://www.cmajopen.ca/content/9/3/E810/tab-related-content) representing approximately 1.0 per cent of individuals working in or attending schools. Teachers are also at no higher risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19, despite what many believe to be a common-sense conclusion that they must be at greater risk being in close contact with many children. In fact, studies looking at either serology or hospital admission rates have found teachers(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.16.21258861v1) to be at lower risk than age-matched workers.So, knowing what we know, why do we continue to close schools in Ontario? Ontario's education unions and school trustees have been advocating for improved working conditions, including smaller class sizes, since before the pandemic. Education workers deserve to teach in optimal learning environments, and students stand to benefit from smaller class sizes, but this most certainly does not mean it is safer for children to learn remotely. In fact, we know that this is not the case. These long-standing requests should not serve as barriers for return to in-person learning, given the myriad of harms that have resulted from Ontario's school closures. Many jurisdictions around the globe, with far fewer mitigation measures, have managed to keep schools open without harming children, teachers and their communities.Children have suffered immensely from ongoing school closures and these harms will have long-lasting effects. Children and youth have experienced disengagement, chronic attendance problems, declines in academic achievement(https://rsc-src.ca/sites/default/files/C%26S%20PB_EN_0.pdf) and decreased credit attainment. They have experienced significant increases in hospital mental health admissions for eating disorders(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2786919) and psychiatric illnesses. Rates of intimate partner violence(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/domestic-intimate-partner-violence-up-in-pandemic-1.5914344) are on the rise, yet reporting of child maltreatment goes down as teachers are not present to protect their students during school closures. School closures have worsened food insecurity(https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2033629) and a parallel pandemic has emerged of childhood obesity(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2783690), with a rise in screen time and a decline in physical activity. We will likely see higher rates of obesity in our pandemic children as they age, and they will face greater risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease as a result.Canada's foremost pediatric experts(https://cps.ca/uploads/advocacy/Remote_learning_in_ON.pdf), including the Canadian Paediatric Society, Pediatricians of Ontario and the Pediatricians Alliance of Ontario have been vocal advocates for in-person learning throughout the pandemic. In a statement released on Jan. 7, they acknowledged that \"certain decisions and measures pose a far greater risk to children and youth than the virus itself\" and pointed out that \"children and youth will be dealing with the fallout from public health measures for years to come.\" Despite their dire warnings, various groups - including education unions, school trustees and non-pediatric medical professionals - continue to build a case for what is necessary for a \"safe\" return to in-person learning. At a special Toronto District School Board meeting(https://pub-tdsb.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=9886) on Jan. 6, trustees resolved that a letter be written to Moore, Ford, Toronto Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa, and provincial Education Minister Stephen Lecce, requesting that COVID-19 be added to the list of mandatory vaccines in the Immunization of School Pupils Act for the purpose of ensuring schools can reopen safely on Jan. 17. There are even rumours circulating that only fully vaccinated high-school students will be allowed to return to in-person learning on Jan. 17; a further attempt to restrict access to a basic human right. Why, in Ontario, do we continue to let non-medical professionals inform public health decision-making, such as the implementation of mandatory vaccination for children?Rupa Subramanya: Deep dive into Ontario's hospitalization data makes the case against lockdowns(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rupa-subramanya-deep-dive-into-ontarios-hospitalization-data-makes-the-case-against-lockdowns)Carson Jerema: There is no convincing case for compulsory COVID-19 vaccinations(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/carson-jerema-there-is-no-convincing-case-for-compulsory-covid-19-vaccination)There is no question that vaccines have changed the course of this pandemic with their ability to substantially reduce severe outcomes(https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2113864) associated with COVID-19, such as hospitalizations and deaths in adults. However, we have come to learn that the vaccines do not stop transmission(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.30.21268565v1.full.pdf), especially in the face of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Therefore, this calls into question the utility of mandatory vaccination when we know that both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals can acquire and transmit the virus. While it is a priority to protect vulnerable adults and high-risk children with vaccination, we can work towards optimizing vaccination without imposing needless barriers to in-person learning.The issue of pediatric vaccination against COVID-19 is a nuanced one. The National Advisory Council on Immunizations (NACI(https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/recommendations-use-covid-19-vaccines/pfizer-biontech-10-mcg-children-5-11-years-age/pfizer-biontech-10-mcg-children-5-11-years-age.pdf)), the foremost authority on vaccines in Canada, has clearly advised that two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine \"may be\" offered to children aged five to 11. This designation is based on the fact that there is still more information to gather including long-term vaccine efficacy in children and potential safety concerns (data to date have been reassuring). NACI stated that \"given the short-term uncertainties surrounding pediatric vaccination at this time, children and their parents should be supported and respected in their decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccinations for the child, whatever decisions they make, and should not be stigmatized for accepting, or not accepting, the vaccination offer.\"As we enter the second week of this fourth prolonged school closure, it is time to stand up and say enough is enough. Our children deserve better. We cannot continue to let external bodies without special expertise in children's health and well-being influence public health policy and subsequent decision-making around schools. Instead, we need to look to other jurisdictions where schools have remained open, or where closures have been kept to a minimum, such as the Scandinavian countries, the United Kingdom and parts of the United States. We are playing with our children's lives and their futures, and until Ontarians stand together in support of our most vulnerable, school closures will continue to be imposed at the expense of the well-being of children and families.National PostDr. Alanna Golden is a primary care physician and former social worker in children's mental health.Dr. Martha Fulford is an infectious diseases physician and associate professor at McMaster University. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
