And I don't think there was much discussion of \"civility\" when, in 2014, the supreme courtstruck down a Massachusetts lawthat mandated a 35-foot buffer zone around clinics that provide abortion services. The court found that it was unconstitutional for protesters not to have to the right to get in the faces of vulnerable people who were just trying to access healthcare. If protesters want to protest in front of a judge's house though? Uncivil!I am all for civility, of course I am. Here's the thing though: civil rights have never been won by grovelling at the feet of people who hate you and saying, 'Please sir, can I have a few more rights?' You simply do not owe civility to people who don't see you as a full citizen. It's worrying how many people seem to think otherwise. If you want a picture of the future, based on the past week, imagine aboot stamping on a human face for ever- and telling you to say please and thank you while it does so.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist"
