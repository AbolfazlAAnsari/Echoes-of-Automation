While it has played a role, we need to look more deeply.Just as was the case 40 years ago, when I published my firstbook, \"The Economics of Worldwide Stagflation,\" there are many factors in play. Several are under our own control.  As in the 1970s, we must look to a mix of conditions, including disruptions to global supply chains, monetary policy, and geopolitics.The first factor in the current inflation is the highly expansionary monetary policy in recent years. The Federal Reserve issuedmore dollarsbetween December 2019 and December 2022 ($3 trillion) than in the preceding 23 years.

The US is alsorestrictingthe sale of technology to China that in turn is disrupting China's own supply chains, with a knock-on effect on US prices.Because of the huge increase in the money supply in recent years, the Federal Reserve does not have any sure fix on stopping the inflation.

Joe Manchin, a Democrat who argued we should raise corporate taxes and other taxes on the wealthy  in order to reduce the budget deficit while also funding some infrastructure, energy efficiency, and social programs.
