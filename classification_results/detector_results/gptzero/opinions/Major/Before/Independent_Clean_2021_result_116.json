Same rules for all.Michael PatePrestonNHS restructureFollowing your article on how failures in other parts of the health service threaten A&E ('Return to crowded A&Es and long ambulance delays will put patients at risk, warn experts', 13 April), could it be that we need to consider health separately from illness, separate but within the same integrated structure?The role of \"primary cares\" would be health rather than illness, with its key functions including services like vaccinations, regular health checks and monitoring, together with health promotion and supporting any recommended lifestyle changes. Primary care could continue to identify and refer conditions to specialists but sudden or severe illness would be treated differently.Treatment for illness or injury would be centred on hospitals where testing facilities and other specialists are close at hand to support medical teams. It would mean patients having to travel further than now and an ability to transport those unable, for whatever reason, to transport themselves would be an essential element but it would mean the patient was at a location where specialist and testing is available to speed diagnosis and prompt treatment rather than waiting weeks for a hospital appointment for test then further appointments for results, diagnosis and treatment.It's apparent from the same day emergency care unit in Hereford that I recently attended that steps along these lines are being developed by professionals better informed than me and a useful debate could be had to determine if we really have a health service right now or is it more of a sickness service and if we need to rethink it and how should the NHS evolve to meet future demands.Based on recent observation, it must help hospitals to function efficiently with the more controlled environment in place due to Covid with less coming and going by friends and relatives, more like the past where visiting was limited, in order to free the staff to get on with the job.John SimpsonRoss on WyeOlympics may have to accept second placeDo we need to be \"faster, higher, stronger\", the Olympic motto, or should we just try to be OK and healthy? The Olympics may yet be cancelled completely after having been delayed a year, says Toshihiro Nikai, secretary general of Japan's Liberal Democratic party, who talked of having to \"give up\".The 2020 Olympics were postponed because of the pandemic and the 2021 version will have few in the stands as overseas spectators have been banned and many of the local citizens aren't interested or actually want it cancelled. Any spectators that would attend will only be allowed to clap and not cheer, which seems a rather sad, pale version of the event.The first priority for most countries is to get citizens vaccinated, stop the spread of the virus and then start on an economic recovery rather than watching two weeks of Olympians and paralympians doing the best they can. Considering how many have already died and will still die, it is probably best to commit all resources to the medical world and stay safe at home. I know a number of Olympic competitors will miss their one opportunity but that may be the cost they have to pay for the safety of the majority.Dennis FitzgeraldMelbourneRead MoreGreensill: 'All decisions taken by the bank were made independently', minister saysWhy is no government willing to take affordable housing seriously?People were right to complain about the BBC's enforced grieving"
