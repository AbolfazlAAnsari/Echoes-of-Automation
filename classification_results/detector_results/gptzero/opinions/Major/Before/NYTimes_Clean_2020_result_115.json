You canread it here.Since this spring, when Americans watched George Floyd take his last breaths as a Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck, we’ve borne witness to the worst that this country’s criminal justice system has to offer:continuedextrajudicial killings,failureto hold officers accountable and state-sponsoredviolenceagainst those standing up for justice.It’s hard to imagine that things could get worse. But draft recommendations from a Trump-appointed policing commission prove that they could.In October 2019, President Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission that Attorney General William P. Barr explained was intended to make the police“trusted and effective guardians of our communities.”From the beginning, its membership — made up entirely of law enforcement — spoke volumes about its intentions. A lawsuit brought by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund argued that the commission makeup violated federal law and this month, afederal judgeagreed. He ordered the commission to halt its proceedings, including the release of the report, until it can meet the Federal Advisory Committee Act’s requirement that demands “fairly balanced” viewpoints aired in publicly noticed, open meetings.But the recommendations drafted before this month’s ruling,first reported by Reuters, nonetheless provide a frightening window into the administration’s vision for law enforcement. I say this without exaggeration: The president’s commission was considering recommendations that could transform this nation into a dystopian police state.In May, my colleagues at the Center for Policing Equity and I were asked to give testimony to the commission. We wrote that a more equitable system of policing can be built only when the police are worthy of trust, not fear. We emphasized the need for more transparency and robust data, not less. And we explained why politicizing law enforcement is dangerous: If communities fear that their safety is contingent on their political beliefs, the trust required for public safety is irreparably harmed.To be clear, some live under those conditions now. But a federal push further in that direction would pour lighter fluid on those burning problems.The recommendations could not destroy public trust more efficiently if they were designed solely for that purpose.Reutersreports that they wouldlimitprosecutors’ power to put in place bipartisan, long-needed reforms such as declining to charge low-level drug offenses and eliminating cash bail. Rolling back that progress would be bad enough. Worse still, hamstringing change-minded officials would curtail the power of voters who cast ballots for them.The recommendations would also make the avenues to accountability for law enforcement so narrow that even the most egregious cases of police violence would have a harder time finding their way to just resolutions. Officers accused of wrongdoing would be granted access to body camera footage before speaking to internal investigators, allowing them to shape legally valid explanations for otherwise incriminating actions. Even more ominously, the U.S. Department of Justice would support “qualified immunity,” a legal precedent that protects officers from civil lawsuits. That would turn the federal agency charged with maintaining the rule of law into a personal defense firm for officers accused of violating it.But the recommendations calling for the destruction of privacy protections are perhaps the most alarming. The commission recommends providing America’s roughly18,000 law enforcement agencies, from small town departments to the New York Police Department, with more money for facial recognition technologies. Because federal agencies can set the reporting requirements and selection criteria for funding to local law enforcement, they often require data sharing. In this case, that could result in data collected at the local level being entered into a national database.The commission also recommends that police departments be granted back door access to encrypted cellphones. This would make it easier for the authorities to access the most intimate details of your life. Whom you spend time with, your private messages, your financial information — all of it would be available to the government, along with any hackers who are able to take advantage of the same access point.“One hopes that recommendations this hostile to privacy and police accountability would not find traction outside the confines of this toxic Commission,” Prof. Christy Lopez of Georgetown Law, a former Justice Department Civil Rights Division attorney who investigated police departments, told me. “But the fact that this administration would even put forward a set of recommendations so antithetical to democratic principles, all in an effort to maintain a policing status quo that the vast majority of Americans agree must be changed, is reprehensible.”Taken together, the upshot is clear. According to Tracey Meares, a professor at Yale Law School, if the recommendations became law, the consequences should worry all of us. With the support of a sympathetic judge, law enforcement would face a lowered barrier to searching the contents of your phone, or adding photos of you and your friends to a nationwide facial recognition database. If the officer used excessive force in the process of obtaining that phone and claimed qualified immunity as a defense, the federal government would be obligated to regularly affirm their support for that officer’s defense regardless of the evidence.It’s not a full-fledged surveillance state. But it’s not far off.To be clear, many of the commission’s recommendations are beyond the ability of any president to implement alone. Congress could refuse to go along, and local governments could use the courts to protect their autonomy. And of course, a judge has halted the commission’s work for now. But the last four years have shown that our institutions and norms are far weaker than many realized. Even with dedicated resistance from inside institutions, legal challenges have been able to slow, but not prevent, the current administration’s cruelty.In a second Trump administration, these recommendations could become an actionable blueprint for the kind of dystopian policing that many — especially those who have never experienced state violence themselves — thought we could never see in the United States. In November and beyond, everyone who cares about public safety must be ready to stand in the way.Phillip Atiba Goff is a professor of African-American studies and psychology at Yale University and co-founder and C.E.O. of the Center for Policing Equity.We’d (@NYTopinion)andInstagram.PHOTO: A NYPD ceremony in 2018.
