Such a system would protect vaccinated people from likely carriers, by preventing unvaccinated people from attending mass events, whether indoor or not. It would also protect them from each other.It seems like a no-brainer. Of course, we know why it will not introduce this measure. It fears its own backbenchers, and it fears the accusation it will be accused of ignoring individual rights. This is clearly nonsense. People still have the right to choose whether or not to have the vaccine. They do not have the right, however, to put other people at risk by that choice.What could be simpler? And yet the government holds back. It has the single most powerful weapon against the virus in its hands, and yet it is afraid to use it effectively.What a weedy nation we have become.Dr Ewan McLeishMarlow, BuckinghamshireRead MoreBeauty advent calendars 2021: Our guide to this year's top treats13 best tech gifts to spoil a gadget geek this Christmas10 best luxury Christmas crackers for dressing up your dining tableLetters: The answer to our staff shortages could be sitting in tents in CalaisLetters: Labour's shadow cabinet can now challenge the ToriesLetters: The belligerent refusal of some to wear masks is prolonging the pandemic"
