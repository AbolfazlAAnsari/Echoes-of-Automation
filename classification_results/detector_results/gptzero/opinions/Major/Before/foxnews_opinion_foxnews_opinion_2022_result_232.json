In the meantime, migrants are allowed to remain in the U.S. and free to move across the country until a final decision is made, most of which do not show up for the proceedings.  If our immigration court system was adequately staffed and Remain in Mexico was enforced, we could reduce our historic backlogs and expedite the entire process.Many people making the trek to Americajust want to make a better life for themselves and their families. Work visas incentivize people who want to come to our nation for economic opportunity. In 2021, the government issued 1.2 million fewer work visas compared to 2020. If we increase the number of work visas issued, it will encourage migration of people looking to work hard and make an honest living just like the American Dream sets out to do.In Congress, I helped introduce the Bipartisan Border Solutions Act, which seeks to hire additional ICE and CBP staff to transition Border Patrol agents out of the processing centers and back on the front lines. It also speeds up deportations of those without legitimate asylum claims. I have also introduced legislation, the Security First Act, to allocate more funding for Operation Stonegarden in order to reimburse local law enforcement for the work they do with Border Patrol to counter drug and human smuggling.The best part about the American Dream is that it doesn’t always start in America. Our country has long relied on immigrants and their many contributions to our society. I want everyone to have an opportunity to achieve the American Dream, just like I had, and like my children will have.We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. Ignoring them creates chaos for the system and risks for those who make the life-endangering trip to get here. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together to address this border crisis.Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales represents Texas' 23rd Congressional District."
