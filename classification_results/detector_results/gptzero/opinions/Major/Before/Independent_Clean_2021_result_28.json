Surely, it is common sense that an entire household comes forward for testing when one of them shows symptoms, we have the test capacity - let's use it. With the full capacity of testing at our disposal, every positive test could save a life.Paul MorrisonAddress suppliedEarly years educationThe government has announced that schools in England are to remain closed after the February half-term and will not re-open until it is safe to do so.However, nurseries and early years education settings have been left out of the conversation entirely.With a lack of clear direction and support from the government through the pandemic, early years settings have found themselves in chaos and forced to make difficult decisions about whether it is safe and financially viable to stay open.With many being asked to remain open, while schools are shut, it is absolutely vital that the government recognises teachers and early years professionals as key frontline workers and gives them priority access to the vaccine, as they continue to provide face-to-face education. There should also be a roll-out of mass asymptomatic testing in these settings, and for those that have been forced to close or that have seen a fall in demand for funded places, the government must introduce targeted funding to protect the future sustainability of the sector.Maccs Pescatore, CEO of Montessori Centre InternationalLondonBrussels spatI don't pretend to understand the ins and outs of thedeveloping spat between London and Brussels concerningvaccine supply but, any wrangling on the subject at a time like this is reprehensible beyond description.Why are people incapable of getting on with each other and cooperating even when so much is at stake?Dr Anthony IngletonSheffieldRead MoreLive: UK may send Covid jabs to EU, No 10 admitsBlack and Latino Americans receiving half the vaccines of white peopleMan detained after 'suspicious package' sent to Covid vaccine factorySchools to stay closed until at least 8 March -follow liveBoris Johnson's trip to Scotland won't save the union, but he's tryingPM claims push for independence 'completely irrelevant' to most Scots"
