            "inputText": "Don't listen to the doom-mongers. Metropolises will continue to provide sanctuary to those who need it and bounce back better and more affordable than everBuild a wall! That is my opinion. Build a big, beautiful wall around New York City and don't let any of the rich people who have fled to other pastures return. Ditto the other metropolises out of which the well-heeled have hot-tailed. You abandon the city in its hour of need, you give up your right of return. It is 2022 and you want to watchthe Hamiltonfollow-upon Broadway? Tough luck, buddy; stream it from the suburbs.Think that is a touch dramatic? It is nothing compared with the histrionics of the worried wealthy. \"NYC IS DEAD FOREVER,\" wrote James Altucher, a former hedge fund manager, ina recentLinkedInpost. Altucher, as you may have guessed, is a big fan of capitalism; he reckons big business in the Big Apple is over. Having concluded that one of the most resilient places in the world is wrecked beyond repair, Altucher packed his bags and relocated his family to Miami. Yes, Miami:the city that is sinking into the sea.Altucher has serious competition when it comes to doom-mongering. On Saturday, the conservative US news anchor Greg Kelly tweeted a video of people queueing for U-Haul moving vans. \"The exodus of New York,\"hedeclared. \"CATASTROPHIC setbacks in quality of life - people have had enough.\" His tweet went viral; not because of alarm at the \"exodus\", but because people were amused that Kelly had not realised the last weekend in August is peak moving season in New York - where renters outnumber owners - because it is when most leases are up. Then again, Kelly probably thinks rent is a musical, not something people pay.The outpourings of rich guys who seem to think New York should function as their personal amusement park have been accompanied by a steady stream of articles predicting the end of the city as we know it. Now that it is clear we can work anywhere, why would you live in a dirty, expensive city?But, of course, people don't come to cities for jobs alone; people come to places such as New York and London to be around other people. They come for the addictive energy that you get only in places where millions of dreams are crammed together. And many of us - misfits and minorities - stay in cities because they are the only places we feel we can be ourselves. I always think it is funny when people talk about cities being dangerous: as a queer, mixed-race woman, New York is probably where I feel safest.It would be dishonest to say that big cities are always wonderful places to be at present. It would be dishonest to say I have not walked past boarded-up shops and piles of trash and had moments of gloom and uncertainty about the future of New York and my place in it. Ultimately, however, there is nowhere I would rather be. Plus, I am confident that cities won't merely recover, but will be revitalised - become better and, hopefully, more affordable than ever. I don't know what is going to happen next, but I can tell you that rumours of the city's death have been greatly exaggerated. Cities are coming back from this. And guess what? The rich will come back, too. After they wait for everyone else to rebuild things.•Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistArwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist"
