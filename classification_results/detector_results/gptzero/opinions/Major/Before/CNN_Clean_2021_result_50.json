But health equity extends beyond just Covid-19: All essential workers should have access to the health care they need, regardless of immigration status.Essential workers should also have access to free, reliable, high-quality childcare, which also means providing the emergency funding necessary to keep childcare providers in business. And we must ensure that workers' right to organize, and their collective bargaining agreements, are protected.Finally, if Congress provides federal support to industries employing essential workers, it must be conditioned on benefits flowing directly to those workers -- retaining or increasing pay, hours, and benefits and providing for necessary worker-safety investments.It is time for America to do right by the workers sacrificing so much for their communities and our country. We must act now to protect the health, economic security, and rights of all essential workers, including those who are undocumented immigrants.TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.
