Sanctions against Iran are opposed by allies and threaten a humanitarian disaster;Nicolás Maduroremains firmly entrenched in Caracas. As for Mr. Trump’s bizarre summits with the North Korean despot, Kim Jong-un, the latest love letter from Pyongyang was a liquid-fueled monster of an intercontinental ballistic missile rolled out on an 11-axle transporter at a military parade.Despite all his many calls to bring the troops home and his power to order it done, thousands are still deployed around the globe, including in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.The troubles of the world are not all Mr. Trump’s doing. China’s rise, Russia’s machinations, the tenacity of Mr. Maduro, the sectarian feuds in the Middle East and the new crop of authoritarian rulers were all underway before he was inaugurated, and would have taxed any president.But Mr. Trump’s willful ignorance of the world (before meeting Russia’s Vladimir Putin in Helsinki he reportedly asked aides whether Finland was part of Russia) combined with his disdain for diplomacy, intelligence and experience (“My primary consultant is myself and I have a good instinct for this stuff”) have often made bad matters worse.The phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that prompted his impeachment — “I would like you to do us a favor, though” — exposed the transactional mentality behind much of Mr. Trump’s worldview.This was the same president who in the first days of his administration angrily pushed the Australian prime minister to cancel an immigration deal he had made with President Barack Obama because otherwise Mr. Trump would be “seen as a weak and ineffective leader in my first week,” or the president who, according to John Bolton, the former national security adviser, asked China’s president, Xi Jinping, to buy more American soybeans and wheat to help the president with the farm vote.The niceties of diplomatic communications have been alien to the star of “The Apprentice.” According to Carl Bernstein,writing for CNN, Mr. Trump called the British prime minister, Theresa May, a “fool” and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany “stupid” in phone calls. Among other insults, Mr. TrumpcalledPrime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada “very dishonest &amp; weak” in a tweet andaccusedPresident Emmanuel Macron of France of making “very, very nasty” remarks.These were close allies. The tone is very different with the bad guys. Mr. Kim, arguably the nastiest despot on earth, made a striking metamorphosis from “little rocket man” to writer of “love letters” in Mr. Trump’s universe after two summit meetings that achieved nothing.The relationship with Mr. Xi went the other way. Before Mr. Trump decided to heap all his coronavirus woes on China, he had repeatedlypraisedits leader — “Terrific working with President Xi, a man who truly loves his country.”In fact, there doesn’t seem to be an illiberal leader Mr. Trump doesn’t admire. The president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, who has led a campaign against drug dealers and users linked to thousands of extrajudicial killings, was doing an “unbelievable job on the drug problem.” Viktor Orban, theautocratic prime ministerof Hungary, was “respected all over Europe.” Recep Tayyip Erdogan,the authoritarian president of Turkeywho often telephones Mr. Trump, “has become a friend of mine.” When Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia became a global pariah over the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Mr. Trump came to his rescue. “I saved his ass,”the president said, according to a book by Bob Woodward. “I was able to get Congress to leave him alone.”All this has been exhaustively chronicled in Mr. Trump’s tweets and declarations and in the rapidly swelling library of tell-all books by outcasts from the revolving door of aides like Mr. Bolton, the impeachment hearings, the dossier compiled by Robert Mueller III or books like Mr. Woodward’s. Yet in all this sound and fury, one mystery stands out. And that is the source of Mr. Trump’s curious reticence before Mr. Putin.What would a Joe Biden victory in November’s election mean for American foreign policy? Many of the dominant currents of world affairs will not change as a result of a change of administration or tone in Washington. Russia will still meddle in foreign elections; China will demand a role commensurate with its wealth and military might; Europe will contribute too little for its defense; a reconfigured Middle East will still be buffeted by sectarian, social and ethnic divisions; North Korea and Iran will pursue their nuclear ambitions.But without Mr. Trump’s crude insults, erratic shifts and self-serving views, the United States will have a chance to reclaim at least some of its moral authority, and his coterie of wannabe dictators will feel less comfortable. Mr. Biden has already pledged to rejoin the Paris climate accord, and he is likely to re-enter other international forums and to take steps to repair relations with miffed allies.If Mr. Trump is re-elected, he will conclude that he has a mandate to continue in his dysfunctional statesmanship, and the world will have no choice but to conclude that the past four years were not an aberration, but the United States they now have to deal with.We’d (@NYTopinion)andInstagram.PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY STEFANI REYNOLDS FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
