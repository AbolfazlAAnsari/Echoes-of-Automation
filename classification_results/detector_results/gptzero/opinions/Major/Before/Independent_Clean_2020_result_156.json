It is an important and welcome development in the curriculum in our schools. Our natural British heritage is under threat as a huge number of species are in rapid decline. It is in everybody's interest to protect our wildlife. A future without bees, who help pollinate many of our vital crops including apples, cranberries, melons, broccoli, almonds, blueberries and cherries, is unthinkable.I look forward to a time when children will learn about our native species and begin to learn to love and protect hares, swallows, hedgehogs and other iconic creatures.But with the lockdown easing, now is the time to teach our children about British wildlife by going on long walks and talking about what you see. The Wildlife Trust has a wealth of information to help hard-pressed homeschoolers to find out more.Judy Carruthers                                           Carlisle"
