Florida is now a test case for the response of American business to government interference in the private sector.His contrarian crusade in April tostripthe job-creating giant Disney of its special self-governance status, regardless of the potential costs to Florida taxpayers, is one example. (DeSantis hasinsistedthat taxpayers won't shoulder any of the Disney World district's debt.) The company became a target for speaking out against what critics call his\"Don't Say Gay\" bill, which bans K-3 classroom discussions of gender identity and sexual orientation and allows parents to potentially sue school districts that engage these topics. The governor's actions generated multiple recentlawsuits, which DeSantis and his state agencies have filed motions to dismiss.And earlier this month, a Florida judgeblockedparts of the Stop WOKE Act, which restricts discussions of race and racial discrimination in the education and business sectors.DeSantis is by no means alone in this quest to discipline the private sector. Punishing corporations and organizations that take stands against Republican illiberal measures is now part of the GOP playbook, asDelta Airlines discovered, when it nearly lost a jet fuel tax break worth $35 million for expressing opposition to a new and highly restrictive Georgia voting law.Yet DeSantis has arguably been the most activist governor, attempting to bullysports teams, state retirement fund managers that useenvironmental, social and governance(ESG) criteria in choosing assets, and even theSpecial Olympicsif their actions express a commitment to values and platforms he disagrees with -- such as gun control, vaccine mandates or climate change.That's why businesses are striking back. A lawsuit brought by wedding registry Honeyfund.com and the diversity consultancies Collective Concepts and Whitespace Consulting argued that Florida's \"Stop the Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees Act\" (the Stop WOKE Act), whichchallengesthe implementation of diversity training programs and exposes corporations that offer them to legal risks, is unconstitutional in its curtailing of free speech.A Florida judge agreed, which is why he blocked the Stop WOKE Act. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker struck the law down and refused to issue a stay to keep it in effect during any appeals by the state.\"If Florida truly believes we live in a post-racial society then let it make its case,\" Walkerwrote. \"But it cannot win the argument by muzzling its opponents.\"Free speech concerns also led to the defeat of much of a DeSantismeasure to fine technology companiesif they deplatform political candidates. While the governor leaned hard into thepopulist rhetoric, calling Twitter and other corporations \"elites\" and \"Big Tech censors\" pushing \"the dominant Silicon Valley ideology.\" Circuit Judge Kevin Newsom, a Trump appointee, was having none of it.\"Put simply, with minor exceptions, the government can't tell a private person or entity what to say or how to say it,\" Newsomruled, finding that social media companies are \"private actors\" protected by the First Amendment.DeSantis' actions against ESG investing suggest that Florida businesses are perhaps pawns in his ambitious plans to run for president. On Aug. 23, he passed aresolutionthat eliminates ESG considerations from Florida state pension fund investments.\"[It] will direct Florida's fund managers to make sound investments on returns not woke ideology. Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) is dead on arrival in Florida,\" the governorannounced.This strongman rhetoric hides the fact that the whole declaration was a performance. As Kent Perez, spokesman for the State Board of Administration that directs the pension fundremarked, Florida's fund was not currently investing with ESG factors in mind. \"We do not invest to make social statements,\" Perez said.Others appointed by Republicans are equally baffled.\"Sadly, [the law] moves us one step closer to authoritarian government,\"saysMarcos Daniel Jimenez, who served as a US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida during the George W. Bush administration. \"Targeting the speech of private employers based on the beliefs and preferences of current lawmakers\" places \"American liberty\" and \"our system of free enterprise\" in jeopardy, Jimenez concludes.But that's okay with DeSantis, whose message that Florida is a \"free state\" with respect to the federal government's \"authoritarian, arbitrary, and seemingly never-ending mandates and restrictions\" covers up his own desire to police speech and behavior.As DeSantis prepares to run for president as a strongman-style leader, he will undoubtedly escalate his attempts to domesticate the private sector. It'll be up to businesses in Florida to lead the way in protecting their rights against autocratic overreach.Opinion by Ruth Ben-GhiatTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
