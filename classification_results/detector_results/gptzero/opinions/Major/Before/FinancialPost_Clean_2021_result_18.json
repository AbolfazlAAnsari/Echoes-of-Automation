If she succeeds, that will have an immediate impact on industries, businesses and people in Ontario and Quebec. Gov. Whitmer's concern is a potential release from Line 5 despite the fact that regulators have determined the line to be safe.Shutting down Line 5 will result in higher oil and gas prices, propane shortages and the potential loss of thousands of direct and indirect jobs in Ontario and Quebec, as well as in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana.Built in 1953, Line 5 delivers crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) feedstock to the Sarnia Petrochemical Manufacturing Complex (SPMC) and helps ensure an efficient, reliable and cost-effective local supply of oil to produce refined products including gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel and other petroleum products that the people of Ontario and Quebec depend on every day.The pipeline is vital to delivering NGL to Sarnia, where it is processed into propane for home heating and, perhaps most importantly, to supply the agricultural sector. Almost 5,000 persons are directly employed with up to another 23,500 indirectly employed in the SPMC. One of every four jobs in Sarnia-Lambton is tied to the petrochemical industry.Quebec would also be severely impacted were Line 5 to be shut down. It feeds Line 9, which runs to Montreal, providing about two-thirds of the crude oil refined and consumed in the province. Line 9 supplies Quebec's only refineries - Suncor in Montreal and Valero in LÃ©vis. These refineries produce gasoline for cars, jet fuel for the Montreal and Quebec City airports, home heating oils, petrochemicals (including polyester fibre used in clothing manufacturing and packaging) and products like asphalt.Without Line 5, these refineries and the four operating in Ontario will have to scramble to find alternative sources of crude oil. Alternatives will cost more, and these higher costs will be passed on to consumers.Any potential alternative to Line 5 would mean a dramatic increase in the number of tanker trucks travelling on our already congested highways and through our communities. The associated safety and environmental risks will create a strain on existing infrastructure. In fact, the infrastructure required to support this massive increase in industrial truck and rail traffic simply does not exist.That Line 5 is safe has been validated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the U.S. federal regulator of pipelines. In its more than six decades of operation, there has never been a release from Line 5. As importantly, Enbridge has announced that it plans to virtually eliminate any future risk of a spill into the Great Lakes by replacing the current four-mile twin pipes crossing the Straits of Mackinac with a concrete-encased tunnel in bedrock more than 100 feet below the lakebed.At the very least, Gov. Whitmer's unilateral action circumvents existing bilateral trade agreements, including the Transit Pipelines Treaty and the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA). The Transit Pipelines Treaty (ratified in 1977 by, among other senators, a young Joe Biden) states that neither federal, state nor provincial governments shall implement measures that would \"have the effect of, impeding, diverting, redirecting or interfering with in any way the transmission of hydrocarbon in transit.\"The treaty provides a mechanism for the federal government to negotiate with the United States.
