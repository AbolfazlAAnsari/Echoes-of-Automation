It enters our food chain, the air we breathe, and our bodies too.Knowing it's in our bodies raises serious concerns, with scientists linking plastic and its toxic cocktail of chemicals to fertility problems, cancer, and diabetes. New research revealed at the Plastic Health Summit in Amsterdam this week is set to further highlight the extent of the plastic health crisis.Rising to the challenge of plastic pollution means we must tackle it from a humanitarian and human health perspective as well as an environmental one. That's why today we're calling on the World Health Organization to declare plastic waste a human health emergency, with a view to prompting urgent action which will reduce its impact across its entire lifecycle.Dr Joan Costa-FontAssociate professor in Health Economics, Department of Health Policy, The London School of Economics and Political ScienceProfessor Dr Dick VethaakDeltares and VU UniversityTerrence J Collins PhDTeresa Heinz professor of Green Chemistryâ¯and director, Institute for Green Science, Department of ChemistryAngaangaq AngakkorsuaqEnvironmentalist and campaigner, IceWisdomMaria WesterbosDirector, Plastic Soup FoundationRising numbersIt is unnerving to read that there are still peoplewho either refuse or can'tbe bothered to vaccinate against Covid-19 to safeguard themselves and their communities.Should these people be protected by the Human Rights Act or should they be at risk in their communities of infection and therefore to others?While people are allowed to travel to and from other countries to Britain various strains of Covid may enter an already delicate balancing act to contain the pandemic.If all British people were vaccinated and boosted when necessary eventually Britain would be able to live with Covid as we do with flu epidemics. But what hope is there when a large minority fail to safeguard their neighbours and communities.Our government seems to be once again ignoring the situation, is it hoping that it will cure itself and Covid will simply go away? As with the role-out of the inoculation system, feeding families etc. it will probably be those that know how to best help that will come to our rescue. Leaving the government red-faced yet again.Keith PooleBasingstokeTackling ChinaWhenever I hear the words \"UK\" and \"net zero\", I feel like banging my head against the wall. Whatever we do in the UK is irrelevant given that the world's major polluters such asChina are continuing to increase their emissionsand won't even begin reducing them till some future date - yet to be determined! Add to that the very real damage being done right now to the UK in terms of energy security, fuel poverty and economic viability and it feels like the lunatics are running the asylum.Andy BrownDerbyMental health investmentWith less than two weeks to thespending reviewand the latest NHS data showing a record number of people seeking mental health treatment, it is time our leaders put sufficient investment behind their warm words about mental health.A £500m injection last winter was welcome as the pandemic peaked and the nation's mental health further plummeted, but the key metrics show people are still reeling from what has been one of the most difficult periods in recent history, with young people and those severely affected by mental illness struggling most.Yet there is no commitment from the government to increase the NHS mental health funding secured pre-pandemic. The need is greatest for overstretched services for under-18s. Funding a network of early support hubs for young people's mental health is also vital. And with ever-increasing numbers of people reaching mental health crisis, the government must put money into its plans to reform the Mental Health Act, to make them a reality.Mental health affects each area of daily life, which is why each government department should be working on a fully resourced cross-government plan, with clear targets: from public health to social care, from education to benefits, from housing to health. We must see all ministers making mental health their business.Simon BlakeChief executive, Mental Health First Aid EnglandRead MoreLetters: All ministers must make mental health their businessLetters: Anger directed at MPs online shows that people feel let down and lied toLetters: We need action to protect MPs from abuse - online or offlineLetters: This government's policy always seems to be 'too little, too late'Letters: The welfare system needs to be compassionate - and meet genuine needLetters: By now policy should beat personality - sadly it still doesn't"
