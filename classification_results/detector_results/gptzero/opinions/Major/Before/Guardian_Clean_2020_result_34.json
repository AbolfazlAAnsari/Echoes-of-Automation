Setting about my extratextual research with a new vigour, I began to fathom Sterne's importance in the comic tradition, and the lineage he shared with the Augustan satirists. But while Sterne, like his forebears, treated with irreverence all manner of contemporary subjects, his humour was humane, mirthful, even kind, primarily in his portrayal of Tristram's father, Walter, and his Uncle Toby, the latter described by literary critic William Hazlitt as \"one of the finest compliments ever paid to human nature\".Essentially good, kind, decent and striving always, often against the odds, to understand and assist one's fellow creatures are the qualities, in Sterne's vision, that best exemplify man.

Walter is every bit the Enlightenment patriarch, beholden to schemes, systems and hypotheses. Sterne draws on the contemporary ideas of the philosopher John Locke to depict how it is the \"unhappy association of ideas\" in the mind, and our proneness to singular obsessions (known as \"hobby horses\" in the Shandean register), often so out of step with reality, that get us into trouble. In a typical joke, we learn that Tristram's father actually despises the name Tristram but, naturally, it is the name he ends up giving his son, via a farcical multistage accident that always makes me think of the immortal line from Brass Eye: \"This is the one thing we didn't want to happen.\"It's the spirit of humour rather than satire that carries things.
