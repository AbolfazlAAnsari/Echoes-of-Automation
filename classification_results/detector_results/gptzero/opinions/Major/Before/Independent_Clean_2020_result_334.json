So much of what we learnt was focused on keeping your head out of the tackle and other pressured areas.The game is obviously much changed today, decades on. But it was my pleasure to find myself on a train with a senior member of the RFU before the pandemic. We had a really good talk about all things rugby. Concussion came up and I was interested to hear that research was not pointing to tackling or pressure in scrums as the biggest problem area. But instead “jackeling” and “pick and go” as the consistently dangerous areas.A combination of the sheer size of all players and the impact of collisions in attack and defensive, with heads inevitably in the lead at the points of impact, was proving the danger.So change will need to address these impacts. Addressing size and weight, the need to get the head protected while jackeling and reduction of those crunching impacts at pick and go around the ruck seem to be logical areas for attention.But a return to keeping your head out of danger seems critical, too.John SinclairPocklington, YorkshireDrug policy has failedI find myself agreeing wholeheartedly with Ian Hamilton’s assertion that illicit drugs policy be reviewed (“Laughing gas is now almost as popular as cannabis – but drug use isn’t the real proble”’, 9 December). It currently does little to prevent the flow of drugs into Britain, there is little or no help for users and after 50 years, users are still causing untold misery in their communities.But where I would take issue with him is that using, selling and importation of illicit drugs has wreaked havoc in every country that has failed to prevent the spread of drug use. To say that “drug use doesn’t cause too many problems for individuals” is misleading. It’s not the user that suffers from drug use but the families and communities plagued with shoplifting, house breaking, theft, rival providers violence, etc.The “main threat” to society is still illicit drug use; however, our drug policies do little to assist users to rehabilitate or safeguard users’ health. Instead, our drug policies make those dependent on drugs social outcasts and criminalise them.Unless there is a comprehensive review of our failed policies of the past 50 or more years, we will still be bewailing the plight of our communities where rampant drugs use has wrought so much pain.A new policy must include youth education, practical and financial support, free drug supply and stop criminalisation of users. If the government (viaNHS) took control, users would be less inclined to steal and be antisocial. Users’ family lives would be less chaotic and communities safer from theft.Cannabis and nitrous oxide seem to me to be “gateway drugs”, which could lead users to experiment with other, more harmful illicit drugs. We ought educate our young people that following a dangerous, ruinous path is avoidable.Keith PooleBasingstokeCinema oversightThere has been a lot of talk by many, including Christopher Nolan and your own Charlotte Cripps (“Christopher Nolan is right – big films need big screens”, 11 December), about the possible demise of big screen cinema.I say that the cinema chains have for so long discriminated against a significant minority of the population that they deserve everything they get. This discrimination, by limiting sub-titled screenings to occasional and unsociable hours, ensures that anyone with less than perfect hearing is wasting their time going. The streaming alternative always (or almost always) has a sub-title or closed captioning option, which ensures that every viewer, whatever their hearing ability, is catered for.Until cinemas offer all or practically all screenings with sub-titles, it will remain an avenue of pleasure which is permanently closed.Nick HawardHavant , HampshireRead MoreThe government has no plan to address the UK’s economic inequalitiesPrince William has undermined the sacrifices of ordinary peopleWe have a once in a lifetime opportunity to regain our fishing waters"
