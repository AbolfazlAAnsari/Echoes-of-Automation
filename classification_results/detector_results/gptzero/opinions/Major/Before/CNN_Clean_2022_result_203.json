Our humanity will win.We will not be erased in the books that line our children's classrooms and librarieshomophobic misanthropesare trying to ban. We worked so hard for so long to earn a rightful place in the canon.We will not be erased by themore than 240 anti-LGBTQ+ billsstate legislatures across the country have proposed in 2022 alone. They can try to take away our health care and athletics, our ability to use bathrooms safely or teach our children we merely exist. But they will never erase us entirely.We will not be erased and go back to a time when we were legal strangers to our children, as with the recent case of Kris Williams in Oklahoma, a mom who was removed from her child's birth certificate byJudge Lynne McGuireafter she and her wife divorced.We will not be erased and go back to a time when we have to fear getting killed going about our business, like two men who werebrutally attackedoutside a bodega in Brooklyn and called gay slurs, or another who wasrecently attackedin the subway in broad daylight.Hate crimes against LGBTQ+ people are up,according to Prism Reports, including outside the US in places likethe UKandGermany,100% higher in presumably LGBTQ+-friendly placeslike New York City as compared to last year, and they are at their highest recorded levels ever for transgender and nonbinary people,according to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC).We cannot afford to be erased.One in five LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered committing suicidein the past 12 months, according to a 2021 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study. What does the number translate to in terms of cost to our health care system when 7% of all Americans, or more than 23 million people, identify as LGBTQ+,according to a 2022 Gallup pollWhat does it do to the ability of our citizens to be productive members of society? What is the impact not only on those vulnerable young people, but also on their families? What about the impact on our social systems, economy and society?We cannot be erased because we have always existed. We are famous philosophers and playwrights, scientists and astronauts, pop culture icons and CEOs and lawyers and doctors and teachers and preachers, andeverything in between. We have survived censorship and genocide, conversion therapy and rejection, expulsion, legal discrimination, hate crimes, microaggressions and everything in between. Yet, we continue to be born, to live and to love.We need look no further than to the determination and resilience of those who took to the streets on June 28, 1969, and one year later, and every year after that, to understand how erasure simply isn't an option. We will continue to show up en masse to be seen because our lives and our families depend on it.Opinion by Allison HopeTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
