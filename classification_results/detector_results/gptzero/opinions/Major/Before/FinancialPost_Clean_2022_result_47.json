According to charity Century Initiative's 2022 National Scorecard, we are falling behind peer countries in productivity. Canada, shot through with small and mid-sized firms, also has trouble helping companies grow.We believe in Canada. We believe that if Canada can grow economically, our influence on the global stage will grow as well. This won't just be in the soft power that we have traditionally traded in, but in the hard power that is again important in an increasingly unstable world.And we believe that Canada's competitive edge can be found in one of our most cherished values: our openness to immigration and to newcomers.Growth and innovation require more than a competitive business environment. They require talent. We should do all we can to attract the most talented people in the world.We have a great head start. The Canadian model - where newcomers are celebrated and welcomed, and where there is consensus on immigration - stands in stark contrast to much of the rest of the world. We are familiar with stories from the United States, where some politicians have demonized newcomers.The U.S. is not alone. Denmark's \"ghetto\" housing policy aims to prevent ethnic minorities from forming their own neighbourhoods, and Britain's memorable vote to exit the European Union was in part over migration controls.Some countries have recognized the advantage that newcomers bring. China, for example, is working to find ways to encourage return migration(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20303193) among entrepreneurs who have left the country.But none of our peer nations enjoys the high levels of popular support around immigration that Canada does. According to Gallup's Migrant Acceptance Index, Canada leads the world in acceptance of newcomers, outranking such peer nations as Sweden, Australia and the United States.This world-leading cultural acceptance of newcomers is a strategic advantage. Where other countries build walls, we tear them down. When others want newcomers out, we bring them in.Canada to bring in record number of immigrants by 2024(https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/canada-sets-ambitious-immigration-targets-for-post-pandemic-recovery)Canada pausing intake of highly skilled immigrant workers amid heavy backlog(https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/canada-pausing-intake-of-highly-skilled-immigrant-workers-amid-heavy-backlog)The advantage this lends to Canada is detailed in a recent Century Initiative report: The impact of immigration on prosperity in Canada(https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f931bff6aee7ca287dbada2/629e3a449dd2c43d2481416f_Key-Insight-Report%233-FINAL.pdf). Immigration has a salutary impact on our economy by deepening our talent pool and accelerating innovations, both of which ultimately boost productivity and GDP.Skilled immigrants disproportionately hold STEM degrees, bringing much-needed skill sets to Canada. When this complements skills that Canadian workers bring to the table, Statistics Canada has found(https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/200914/dq200914c-eng.htm) that this has a real impact on productivity.Immigrants are also often less risk-averse and more entrepreneurial. Take Century Initiative research from 2021(https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f931bff6aee7ca287dbada2/61b77e0e0f07f59ea83dba78_Key-Insight-Report%232-FINAL.pdf), which found that a third of Canadian private tech companies best positioned to grow into world-class firms were founded or cofounded by immigrants, outpacing immigrants' share of Canada's population.A separate Statistics Canada analysis found that immigrant-owned firms are more likely to implement innovations in their businesses. And we know that in the U.S., immigrants are more likely to file patents, which is a useful proxy for innovation, and consequently, productivity.But ultimately, the greatest benefits of immigration to our economy are long-term, through solving pressing demographic challenges that threaten the sustainability of our public services and our workforce.This is our opportunity to find the world's most brilliant, skilled, ambitious and entrepreneurial people, help them make Canada their home, and give them the tools and resources they need to innovate, thrive and help our country prosper.This is not to say that Canada's immigration and labour practices are perfect. Maximizing the economic benefits of immigration means making the sound policy choices that allow immigrants to succeed.Although we welcome increasingly high numbers of people per year, often, our regulations and institutions prevent these new Canadians from making full use of their skills. For example, it took COVID-19, and the related staffing shortages, for our provincial governments and regulatory colleges to make real progress on allowing foreign-trained medical professionals to practice in Canada.Further, we must work to ensure that our cultural acceptance of immigrants and their interest in coming to Canada are sustainable. This means real action on housing. So long as housing prices remain out of reach, immigrant interest in Canada will decline - and Canadians' acceptance of newcomers could potentially wane.Finally, our immigration system could also be modernized, such as by building on the Express Entry system to streamline entry to Canada. The recently launched Alberta Accelerated Tech Pathway program is an example of modernization already under way. The provincial government collaborated with private businesses, including IT talent consulting firm MobSquad, to help organizations better (and more quickly) attract high-skilled talent in areas where Alberta is experiencing shortages.Despite the barriers, there is undeniably an opportunity for Canada at this moment. Other countries may impose whatever restrictions they want at their borders. It is their sovereign right to impoverish themselves. But their loss is our gain.This is our moment. We should seize it, embrace immigration, welcome the world's most talented people, and help them succeed.And in doing so, we'll grow in influence, power and prosperity.Special to National PostLisa Lalande is the CEO of Century Initiative and Irfhan Rawji is the Founder and Executive Chair of MobSquad, and Managing Partner at Relay Ventures. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
