He also said that he would personally review every employee request for an exemption but that, generally, \"If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned.\"In announcing this draconian policy that disregards the needs, desires and realities of many American workers, Musk probably thinks he's going to extract more and better work out of his staff. He's sadly mistaken. The policy is likely to have the exact opposite effect, driving talent and innovation out of his electric vehicle company.To state the obvious, Tesla's policy ignores the 60% of Americans with jobs that can be done remotely who say they want towork from homeall or most of the time even after Covid, according to a 2022 Pew Research Center survey. Women and members of marginalized groups are especially likely to want to work from home all or part of the time because of either a lack of child care, other demands at home, or because they often feel excluded in their office environments.

In fact, 80% of hybrid andremote workerssaid in a 2022 survey conducted by Edelman Data x Intelligence for Microsoft that they're equally or more productive than they were when they worked from the office.What's more, this policy will almost certainly cause a staff exodus from Tesla. American workers are already jumping ship from their employers in record numbers as part of the \"Great Resignation,\" with about half of workers looking for a new job or at risk of leaving, partly because they're looking for more flexible options, according to a survey conducted byWillis Towers Watson, an insurance and risk management company.Tesla's policy will also likely make it harder for the company to attract top talent in the future.
