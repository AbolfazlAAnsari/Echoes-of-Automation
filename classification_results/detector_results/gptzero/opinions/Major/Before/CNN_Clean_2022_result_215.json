He also said that he would personally review every employee request for an exemption but that, generally, \"If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned.\"In announcing this draconian policy that disregards the needs, desires and realities of many American workers, Musk probably thinks he's going to extract more and better work out of his staff. He's sadly mistaken. The policy is likely to have the exact opposite effect, driving talent and innovation out of his electric vehicle company.To state the obvious, Tesla's policy ignores the 60% of Americans with jobs that can be done remotely who say they want towork from homeall or most of the time even after Covid, according to a 2022 Pew Research Center survey. Women and members of marginalized groups are especially likely to want to work from home all or part of the time because of either a lack of child care, other demands at home, or because they often feel excluded in their office environments.
