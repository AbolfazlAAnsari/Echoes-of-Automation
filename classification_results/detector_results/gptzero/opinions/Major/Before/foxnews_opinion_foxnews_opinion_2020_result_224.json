When AOC claims that capitalists merely leech off the true value of labor, she suggests that labor can be measured without reference to the market.How would AOC measure the value of such labor? Presumably through appeals to \"fairness.\" There is only one problem with this method: It simply doesn't work. Consumers determine the value of products; producers do not.The diffuse informational system of the free market, which rewards the power of entrepreneurship, rather than punishing it, creates prosperity; top-down control creates poverty. In fact, the greatest guarantee of the sort of poverty AOC decries is the destruction of the same system she decries.But according to AOC, we have nothing to fear from government, and \"the government is us.\" The fact that Coates, one of the most prominent writers on the evils of Jim Crow, nodded along should demonstrate that those on the left do not understand the consequences of their own philosophy.The government is not \"us,\" because we are not a collective. We are individuals with rights. But in AOC's world, we have no rights -- we have only our role as members of a collective controlled by those who agree with her. That is real exploitation and tyranny.FROM BEN SHAPIRO   "
