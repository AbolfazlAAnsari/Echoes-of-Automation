Inflation is high, they say, because firms have greater power to raise prices andincrease profitsthan they did in previous decades.We disagree.Instead, over the past few quarters, the rise increasingly reflects the tight labor market and the increase in labor costs, includingwagesandbenefits.Businesses set the prices of their products so that they can earn a profit beyond the costs of their labor and materials. Their profit margins and markups typically rise and fall with demand. If sales permit, a rise in costs or profit objectives will lead firms to raise the prices of their products. When this occurs persistently across the economy, not just in an isolated firm or sector, the result is inflation.Some people argue that, over recent decades in broadening swaths of the US economy, a few dominant firms can more easily raise their profit margins, resulting in corporate \"greedflation.\" To be sure, there is substantial evidence both for increasedconcentrationand reduced competition. In addition, from the early 1960s to the end of 2019, the share of business income used tocompensateworkers declined by nearly 10 percentage points to 57%, allowing businesses to pocket more in profits. Importantly, however, this long-run shift away from workers' incomes and toward firm profits came regardless of whether inflation was high or low.Moreover, we see little evidence that greedflation is driving the recent rise in inflation. In the decades prior to the pandemic, both labor costs and profits contributed significantly to inflation. But the 2020s are strikingly different. Over the past two-and-a-half years, labor costs look to be the real culprit, not profits. Indeed,labor's shareof business income has climbed back toward 60% since the pandemic, reversing a modest portion of the long-run decline.Why do labor costs account for such a large fraction of the recent rise in inflation? There are two key reasons. First, the US labor market is extremely tight. The combination of a 3.5%unemployment rateand a 6.6%vacancy rate- nearly twoopeningsfor each person searching for a job - is unprecedented. As a result,wages and salariesare rising at an annual rate of 5.7%, more than two percentage points faster than before the pandemic. Second, even as output slipped, firms continued to hire new workers rapidly this year, so productivity (the ratio ofoutputper hour worked) tumbled.
