Like a good caddie, the scientists have been trying to advise on the best shot to play out of the rough. The real question is how we got so far off the fairway to start with.Malcolm Harris                                          GrimsbyThe road to economic ruinCompared with countries like Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, where deaths are few and there has been no full lockdown, the UK's response to coronavirus had been woeful. Clearly there has been a considerable lack of competence among those at the top of organisations like Public Health England, which wasted its time fussing about us drinking too much fizzy drink instead of preparing for a pandemic that experts have been warning about for decades. The UK has been far too slow in obtaining PPE, test kits, ventilators and in distributing loans and funds to support businesses. If the same slow response is applied to our emergence from lockdown, it will bankrupt this country. Urgent action, top people and bravery are now needed to save us from economic ruin. From Monday open factories, building sites, large shops and garden centres, while adopting the 2-metre distancing so successfully implemented by supermarkets. If we dither much longer it will be too late.David Kilpatrick                                          St AlbansStubborn SturgeonWe must be grateful to the Scottish government's clinical director, Professor Jason Leitch, for confirming as \"rubbish\" claims that suppliers are being asked to divert PPE to prioritise supplying England over Scotland. However, while Professor Leitch characterised the UK's approach as \"pretty aligned\", it's regrettable Nicola Sturgeon and her health secretary, Jeane Freeman, seemingly hastily seized on the suggestion and grabbed headlines. Ms Sturgeon had hitherto fulfilled her role as an integral part of the UK team satisfactorily, reinforcing the UK line on tackling the virus. Let's hope she doesn't revert to her usual manufactured grievance politics at this crucial time.Martin Redfern                                           EdinburghWe were ill-prepared for this pandemicRishi Sunak has said that \"we came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses\". Maybe. Or maybe not. But we undoubtedly came into this crisis with an NHS decimated by Tory cuts, combined with a hostile environment that deprived the country of many health and social care workers. And we undoubtedly came into this crisis having recklessly turned our back on the EU, and therefore on any lasting opportunities for collaborative research. So much for the ingenuity of the British people.Beryl Wall                     London"
