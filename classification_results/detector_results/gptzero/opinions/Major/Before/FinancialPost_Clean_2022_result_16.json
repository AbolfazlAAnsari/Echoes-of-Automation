            "inputText": "By Wes Hall and Dahabo Ahmed-OmerFor generations, homeownership has enabled Canadians to build equity to start businesses, support children's post-secondary education, provide for retirement and transfer wealth to offspring. For generations, the Black community in Canada has been left behind.A history of systemic racism has excluded the Black community from buying homes in Canada. As late as the 1950s in Ontario, homeowners were still using restrictive covenants that stated property could not be transferred to someone who was Black. In the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) today, homeownership is still highly racialized: 73 per cent of residents who are homeowners are white and have a higher income and 69 per cent of residents who are renters are racialized and have lower incomes.Looking at the 2016 census, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) found the homeownership rate among the Black community was the lowest of any racialized group, sitting at 38.4 per cent, while the national average was 70.3 per cent. RBC also pointed out that if racialized groups - including Black Canadians - owned homes at a similar rate to white Canadians, their net wealth would be $100 billion higher today.The BlackNorth Initiative (BNI) Homeownership Bridge Program was recently launched to build generational wealth and mobility for the Black community. In partnership with Habitat for Humanity GTA and empowered by the Dream Legacy Foundation, the BNI Homeownership Bridge Program is the first of its kind and begins to bridge the divide. It was designed to mobilize all levels of society to address systemic barriers in the housing crisis facing Black communities across this nation.The BNI Homeownership Bridge Program is designed as both a symbolic and a practical approach for Canadians to work together to readdress systemic racism.The Homeownership Bridge program offers an affordable housing solution to help address the issues of intergenerational wealth, racial inequity, and access to homeownership. It enables wealth growth by building an asset to leverage for other opportunities. These families will be paying taxes - an estimated $70 million to $90 million in municipal property taxes. These families will be creating pride in their neighbourhoods. These families will change the way society perceives Black families. The Black community will give and invest back in our communities to uplift everyone - a community impact to be felt for generations. Our forecasting shows the program will create between $60 million and $75 million in new Black household wealth in a single generation. This is what transformational change looks like.Wes remembers coming to Canada from Jamaica as a young man. He keeps a picture of the tin shack where his single grandma raised him and many of his siblings and cousins close to his desk, to remind him where he came from. He knows firsthand the positive ripple effect of purchasing your own home. Purchasing a home was a gateway to boundless chances, most notably the opportunity to raise his children in a safe, stable and adequately sized home, and the ability to build equity to start his successful business.Chris George: Fighting anti-Black racism - why it is different this time(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/chris-george-fighting-anti-black-racism-why-it-is-different-this-time)Opinion: How do I legalize my Blackness?(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-how-do-i-legalize-my-blackness)Dahabo remembers immigrating from Somalia, a war-torn country, and seeking refuge in Canada with the promise of a better life. For decades, she and her family were put into crowded and substandard community housing. This was her first \"new normal.\" She understood that she was personally responsible for building a more ethical and equitable society than the one she grew up in. We have a responsibility to provide safety and security for our most marginalized communities. Let's begin with the basics because there's no place like home.As wealth usually and historically gets passed down in Canada, this is still not an option for many Black Canadian families. Everyone in Canada deserves a safe and affordable place to call home - a place of dignity, belonging and integrity. The impact on that first generation will be tremendous, but the ongoing return on this investment will be felt for ages. That is beyond measure!The BNI Homeownership Bridge Program will enable pride, determination, and the greater pursuit of dreams. A place to truly call home.Special to National PostWes Hall, the Founder and Executive Chairman of BNI, is a Canadian businessman and entrepreneur.
