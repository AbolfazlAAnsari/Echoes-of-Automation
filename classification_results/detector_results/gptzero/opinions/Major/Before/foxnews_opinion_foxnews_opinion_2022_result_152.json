Yeah. We're doing an hour on abortion.I'm speaking of theMet Gala.At 37 grand per ticket and security to keep us dirty folk at a distance, masked photographers were still allowed in to make sure the elites didn't get all dressed up for nothing.And what a glorious spectacle of the world's richest and most beautiful people gallivanting like Clydesdale horses in drag, starving themselves on cigarettes and Diet Coke. The breakfast of supermodels. Fun fact. That's how Mr. Ed's wife died.So, let's run through the conformity. There'sKaty Perry. She seems to have lost her kooky style and her mask. When they asked her who she was wearing, she said, \"hefty bag.\"GREG GUTFELD: CELEBRATE THE PEOPLE WHO WORK TO KEEP AMERICA GOINGThere's Kendall Jenner. Take a look at this. She ditched her bra, her mask, but also her eyebrows. Talk about plucky. You go, girl. Although I wonder where her eyebrows ended up. Talk about moving up in the world. She looks permanently surprised, like she accidentally sat on a poor person.Hillary Clinton arrives at the In America: An Anthology of Fashion themed Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, New York, U.S., May 2, 2022. REUTERS/Brendan McdermidAnd then look at Cara Delevingne – no shirt, her torso soaked in gold paint. She better be careful or she might end up in William Devane’s safe. She looks like a bowling trophy with breasts. Of course, she had no mask either. How else would anyone recognize her?Then there's Hillary in a long flowing gown. I got to say, that's quite a train and not the kind Bill likes. I'm referring to Amtrak. Thank you. Yes. Underrated. And without a mask, you can look at her smile, although it's probably gas.Of course, the poor plebe handling the bottom part of the skirt is masked. So maybe she did have gas. But can you imagine if Melania had a black dude handling her a gown? The screams of racism would be louder than the dresses. But I often wonder what Bill doesn't see in her, besides a soul.So there you go. The perfect illustration of how elites expect the rest to behave. It probably wasn't the unwashed masses that coined the term \"unwashed masses.\" They enforce the rules for others, but not for them. With or without the masks, we can see who they really are deep down at events like this. Strutting around like butter wouldn't melt in their lying mouths.Who knew a couple hundred years ago, our ruling class would end up emulating the very a-holes we threw off our backs so we could be free in the first place. The masked and unmasked – master and servant.It's not about race or gender. It's about power.NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 02: Blake Lively attends The 2022 Met Gala Celebrating \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\" at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 02, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)(Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)The theme of the gala was \"gilded glamor,\" but it should have been the Victorian era.Contrasting excess with servitude and masks are definitely the new whitehead caps worn by old maids. And it appears to have gone to a lot of their heads.STAFFER 1:Oh, my goodness. Our cup runneth over. Look at this feast, huh? You know, it's so nice for Kat to take us out to lunch. But I got to say, ever since she got back from the White House Correspondents Dinner, she's been acting different.STAFFER 2:What am I looking at here?STAFFER 1:Well, we only had the one Cheez-it.Speaker 2:No, not that. But where are your masks? You're not famous like I am, so you need to cover those unrecognizable faces. I’m not even hungry. Got to go to the vomitorium to work up an appetite. Please take me there.If only she were acting. But if we learned anything from the pandemic, those in power could make you locked down while being free as a mugger in Manhattan. Speaking of, facing the explosion in violent, murderous crime, this is what New York's Mayor Eric Adams, wears. It's like Liberace joined the Crips.Yes, that's a fashion statement, a tuxedo jacket that screams \"end gun violence.\" I mean, he knows he's the mayor, right? That's his job.Rumor has it he bought it at a Bill de Blasio yard sale. Well, this will stop crime for sure.
