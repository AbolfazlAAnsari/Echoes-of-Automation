Also: Unvaccinated tennis players; abuse of flight attendants; obsessive-compulsive disorder; ex-offenders.To the Editor:Re “Why I’m Not Making a Bucket List,” by Kate Bowler (Opinion guest essay, Sunday Review, Aug. 29):Dr. Bowler’s words resonated with me as a fellow young dying mom. I don’t have a bucket list. People assume I do, but most don’t bring it up because it’s smashed right up against the uncomfortable topic of my dying.Three years ago I was given two to five years to live when I was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease. I was 37 years old with a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old.In my life there was always a blurry, overarching narrative that time was untrustworthy, egging me on to do the thing, now. I have traveled the world, constantly widened my comfort zone, been drawn to risks. The bucket list is moot when you live this way. All I want now is more time with my children, however ordinary.When I think of Thoreau’s words — “to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life” — I think of letting yourself unashamedly be as outwardly weird as we all are inside. Of doing whatever you do with acceptance of what is. Of loving without fear of judgment, abandonment or the future.A bucket list at the end of life is a lot of pressure. We dying people feel enough pressure to be present every moment and make the most of the time we have left. So you learn to dismiss the pressure and relax into your flawed human self, do what you can wholeheartedly and forgive yourself the rest.Evan CampaNashvilleTo the Editor:My son contracted Stage IV colon cancer 10 years ago. He lived a year of fullness before dying at 27. Since that time, the term “bucket list” has always grated on me, and Kate Bowler describes the issues so well.I choose not to have a bucket list but to enjoy each day to its fullest, in honor of what my son taught me about living well and not regretting missing some arbitrary experience. This last year of narrowing our horizons through pandemic restrictions has made me savor simpler pleasures and those close to home.Merriel KruseMadison, Wis.Unvaccinated Tennis PlayersTo the Editor:Re “Rackets in Hand, and Not Getting Shots in Arm” (Sports, Aug. 31):At the U.S. Open, which began last week, all of the attendees must be vaccinated, but not the players and their entourages. How can this be permitted in this age of supposed enlightenment about Covid?Such cavalier carelessness and selfishness (and stupidity) on the part of the players is a blot on their reputations — and the reputation of the tournament.Jackie SchwimmerNew YorkHow to Stop Abuse of Flight AttendantsTo the Editor:Re “For Flight Attendants, a Summer of No Rest and Looming Menace” (Business, Sept. 4):The airline industry and the F.A.A. can put a stop to onboard disruptive passenger behavior overnight. All they have to do is announce that any passenger who abuses a flight attendant will be immediately placed on the “no fly list” subject to an appeal.That means no business travel or family vacations and a lengthy appeal process that will be costly and might end with a permanent ban.Let’s give it a try!Charles H. GessnerMarblehead, Mass.Treating and Coping With O.C.D. Amid CovidTo the Editor:Re “Living With O.C.D. in a Pandemic,” by Jane E. Brody (Personal Health column, Aug. 17):As O.C.D. researchers and clinicians, we were pleased to read this important piece emphasizing the silver linings of the pandemic for those with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Over the past 18 months, we have likewise observed the advantages of integrating telehealth into treatment for patients with O.C.D.Telehealth not only made exposure and response prevention (E.R.P.) therapy more accessible during a time of inordinate stress, but also offered some unique advantages over E.R.P. in an office setting, such as better tailoring of exposures to real-world situations in the patient’s home.Indeed, a growing body of research supports the efficacy of delivering E.R.P. via telehealth. We encourage insurance providers to continue reimbursing patients for remotely delivered treatment and urge state licensing boards to make it easier for mental health professionals to provide treatment across state lines. In doing so, more people can continue to access help, even after the threat of Covid-19 subsides.Dianne M. HezelReilly KayserH. Blair SimpsonNew YorkThe writers are clinician-scientists at the Center for O.C.D. and Related Disorders, Columbia University Irving Medical Center.To the Editor:Thanks to Jane E. Brody for drawing attention to the struggle of living with O.C.D. and how it has exponentially intensified during a global pandemic. What she doesn’t mention, however, is the entirely new type of distress sufferers like me must now grapple with as society slowly returns to a semi-normal state.For a period of time, the world’s collective anxiety rose up to meet our own, and our years of mental anguish could almost be justified (albeit to ourselves alone) as some sort of prolonged, purposeful preparation. Now, as most around us rejoice with relaxed restrictions, those of us with O.C.D. are once again reminded that the world doesn’t function as we do, our anxieties are, for the most part, irrational, and we must fight them, or risk their steering the direction of our daily lives.Katrina BrewerCambridge, Mass.How to Engage At-Risk Ex-OffendersTo the Editor:Re “Jobs Bring Dignity” (Opinion guest essay, Sunday Review, Aug. 8):Jamie Dimon’s essay is a call to action to give ex-offenders a second chance. But to avoid the tragedies of lives wasted in jails and prisons, we need to address the societal conditions that result in the United States’ being the country of mass incarceration.Unless we reach and connect with underrepresented youth, particularly Black and Latinx men, in meaningful ways, we will continue to grow the prison population, paying $82,000 a year to incarcerate an individual versus $22,000 a year to provide effective education.We need to replace the “school-to-prison pipeline” with a “school-to-success pipeline” that provides pathways to college and increased social mobility. We must educate underrepresented youth both in school and through after-school programs in ways that build on students’ strengths, resonate culturally with the students, and offer interactive rather than standardized approaches.Examples of this student-centered approach are the P-TECH schools started by IBM and the Harlem Gallery of Science, launched by the City College of New York, which engages marginalized youth in learning about STEM pathways.Claire AltmanNew YorkThe writer is a former associate director of the Vera Institute of Justice.To the Editor:I approve of Jamie Dimon’s idea of job creation with ex-offenders in mind. I approve of his idea of networking with employers to have good outcomes with ex-offender employees. But I do not approve of clearing or sealing criminal records. Employers have a right to know such things about their applicants’ backgrounds.Some offenders are rehabilitated and some are not. Some have addressed their deep-seated psychological issues and some have not. It’s hard to tell that right off the bat.We need more and better psychotherapeutic services for low-income people, whether or not they have broken the law. We also need better parenting, at all socioeconomic levels. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.Sharon KassWashingtonPHOTO:   (PHOTOGRAPH BY Masha Krasnova-Shabaeva FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
