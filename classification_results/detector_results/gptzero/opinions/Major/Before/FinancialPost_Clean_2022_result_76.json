Since then no party has dared raise the funding issue again. But the problem then was mainly with the messaging, not the concept itself. Public debate at the time revolved around whether the government should fund private religious schools. Many Ontarians recoiled at the idea, afraid that funding religious schools would lead to a more balkanized society.Matthew Lau: Volunteer for net-zero - or else!(https://financialpost.com/opinion/matthew-lau-volunteer-for-net-zero-or-else)Bjorn Lomborg: Elite disconnects on climate and prices could lead to chaos(https://financialpost.com/opinion/bjorn-lomborg-elite-disconnects-on-climate-and-prices-could-lead-to-chaos)Opinion: Ottawa should stop stoking food insecurity(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-ottawa-should-stop-stoking-food-insecurity)But what such aid is really about is letting money follow the student. All parents pay taxes, no matter where their children attend school. So it makes sense that parents should have the ability to direct at least some of their tax dollars to schools of their choice, whether public, Catholic or independent.As for concerns about subsidizing religion, the province already provides 100 per cent funding for Catholic schools. Unless you think Catholics are inherently more worthy of government support than people of other faiths, it makes no sense to deny funding to independent schools because of their religious (or non-religious) affiliation. And there's no evidence that British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Quebec are more balkanized or divided than Ontario, even though all five of these provinces have long funded independent schools.There's also a major fiscal benefit. When funding follows the student, taxpayers can save money. Most provinces that fund independent schools provide only partial (usually 50 per cent(https://www.cardus.ca/research/education/reports/lessons-for-ontario-education-diversity-across-canada/)) funding for each independent school student. The rest of the budget for these schools comes from private donations and/or tuition fees. In other words, these provinces get a 50 per cent discount for every student in an independent school - not an unimportant fact for Ontario, which has run budget deficits for 15 years in a row.Though government pays less than the full freight public funding allows tuition fees to be lower, making independent schools available to a wider group of parents. And independent schools have a strong track record(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/comparing-the-standardized-test-scores-of-british-columbias-public-and-independent-schools) of providing a solid academic education and can offer more specialized programming than is typically available in the government-run system. No one can seriously argue that kids need to attend government-run schools these days to receive a quality education.Ontario parents deserve the same options as parents in Quebec and the western provinces. With the prospect looming of a school year disrupted by teacher strikes, parents should not be trapped in government-run schools. Letting the money follow the student is sensible and fair. Making more education options available to parents and students is always a good thing.Michael Zwaagstra, a public high school teacher, is a senior fellow with the Fraser Institute. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
