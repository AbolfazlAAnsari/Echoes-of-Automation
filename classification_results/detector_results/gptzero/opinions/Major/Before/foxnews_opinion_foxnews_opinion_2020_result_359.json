But their ability to adapt to this uncertainty and thrive in spite of it, reminds me what the human spirit is capable of.Of course, it hasn’t been easy. One of the ways that refugees build resilience is by giving back to the community. It’s why so many of our students’ parents are essential workers. Healthcare is the second most common career for refugees, withmore than 161,000people caring for our sick as physicians, nurses, personal care aides and lab technicians, according to New American Economy.Refugees also play a crucial role in our food supply chain.More than 31,000work in grocery stores and supermarkets, andmore than 46,000in food processing. Immigrants also comprisemore than one in eighteducation workers, including 9.6 percent in Georgia and5.8 percentin Ohio. These jobs are equally essential and will become increasingly dangerous as daycares and schools begin to reopen. But take it from me: we do this work because we care.Practicing resilience isn’t easy. Earlier this semester, a 13-year-old student named Eissa had a panic attack in art class. The night before, members of his family in Syria had been killed in a bombing.Between sobs he told me, “They are all dead.”When I dropped him off at home later, his mother answered the door. I searched for words to console her.Finally, she said, “We are lucky that we are here, and that we are alive.” Having fled LGBTQ persecution myself, I understood what she meant. America is our home now.The families at our school feel the same. As our students become more confident, so do their parents, pursuing their own educations and careers.Many of my students have gone on to college and become airplane mechanics and serve in the military.That’s what America has given people seeking refuge: a fresh start, a chance to live. And in return, they do everything in their power to give back to this country.Fifteen years ago when I came across those boys playing soccer in Clarkston, I remember being struck by their creativity. They’d taken a deflated ball and some cardboard boxes and created joy.Now, as Americans celebrate Pride, I know we will find similar glimmers of happiness and hope.We are Americans. We are resilient. We will emerge stronger, our heads held high.   "
