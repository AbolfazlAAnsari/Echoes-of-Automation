            "inputText": "Despite an estimated five million deaths worldwide from COVID-19, the rapid deployment of effective vaccines has offered adults excellent protection against severe disease and death. High vaccination rates protect the elderly and adults with comorbidities, who face a much higher risk of hospitalization and death than children. However, despite the accumulation of massive amounts of reassuring scientific data, the public continues to worry that COVID-19 poses a risk to children. Unfortunately, because of this, children are continuing to face strict restrictions in schools and sports, causing significant harms.Most children who contract the virus are asymptomatic. According to the Murdoch Children's Research Institute(https://www.mcri.edu.au/sites/default/files/media/documents/covid-19-and-child-and-adolescent-health-140921.pdf), \"Children and adolescents who have COVID-19 will commonly have no or only mild symptoms, similar to a cold.\"According to a pre-print study(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.29.21261282v2) that compiled multi-country data, the chance a child will be hospitalized if infected is between one in 500 and one in 1,000. Yet even this risk may be an overestimate: according to a study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal(https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/38/E1483), nearly 40 per cent of children who were considered hospitalized with COVID-19 in 2020 were there for unrelated reasons. Furthermore, data from Public Health England(https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1016465/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_36.pdf) found that unvaccinated children are at a lower risk of hospitalization when compared with fully vaccinated 40-49-year-olds. And the delta variant, while more transmissible, does not appear to cause more severe disease in children(https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/15615?autologincheck=redirected) or adults(https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7043e1.htm).We must put COVID-19's pediatric mortality risk into context: according to U.S. Centres for Disease Control (CDC) data for 5-14 year-olds, motor vehicle accidents and suicide are each responsible(https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/18/briefing/kids-covid-and-delta.html) for 10 times and 7 times the number of deaths than from COVID, respectively. The 700 American children whose deaths(https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3) have been attributed to COVID-19 since January 2020 is less than the number of youth influenza deaths in the 2017-18(https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018/archive.htm) and 2018-19(https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html) seasons combined.A study from England(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01578-1) of the 3,105 childhood deaths during the first 12 months of the pandemic found that only 25 of those deaths were due to COVID-19 - equivalent to a COVID-19 mortality rate of two per million children. Of these, over 75 per cent had co-morbidities and 60 per cent had a life-limiting condition, meaning it is important to identify the children at highest risk, prioritize them for vaccination and understand what works best to protect them.Lasting COVID-19 symptoms is a potential concern for children. However, long COVID definitions include over 200 symptoms, many of which are nonspecific and common among kids who have not been infected with COVID-19. Despite sensational media claims that long COVID may develop in up to a quarter of infected children, recent studies with adequate sample sizes and control groups have shown that long COVID is much more rare in this population.For example, the Office of National Statistics(https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/technicalarticleupdatedestimatesoftheprevalenceofpostacutesymptomsamongpeoplewithcoronaviruscovid19intheuk/26april2020to1august2021) in the United Kingdom found the prevalence of persistent symptoms 12-16 weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 infection to be no different between infected and uninfected children. Another study(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782164) found that four per cent of children who tested positive reported at least one symptom lasting beyond 12 weeks, but this also happened in two per cent of the control subjects.It is now apparent that school closures have had negative consequences that will shape a generation. A recent report in the Health and Human Rights Journal(https://www.hhrjournal.org/2021/10/ensuring-rights-while-protecting-health-the-importance-of-using-a-human-rights-approach-in-implementing-public-health-responses-to-covid-19/) described school closures as violating basic rights to quality of education and nutrition, predominantly affecting students with special needs and from low-income families.Numerous studies, including data from Vancouver(https://www.cmajopen.ca/content/cmajo/9/3/E810.full.pdf), show that schools do not play a major role in viral spread. Likewise, studies(https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2060) show(https://outbreaknewstoday.com/sweden-report-teachers-do-not-have-a-higher-risk-of-being-infected-with-covid-19-49944/ ) that teachers are not at a higher risk from COVID-19 than those working in other professions. However, the collateral damage from prolonged school closures and other restrictions has been significant.Important risk factors for severe disease or death from COVID in children, such as obesity(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34529635/ ) and Type 2 diabetes(https://www.diabetes.org/newsroom/press-releases/2021/new-study-shows-hospitalization-rates-for-new-onset-pediatric-t2d-doubled-during-COVID-19), have dramatically increased. Mental health disorders are also rising, including significant increases in pediatric eating disorders(https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/148/4/e2021052201/179731/Medical-Admissions-Among-Adolescents-With-Eating?autologincheck=redirected). In the United States, emergency room visits for children with mental-health related concerns increased by 24 per cent (ages 5-11) and 31 per cent (ages 12-17) during the pandemic. Youth thinking of or attempting suicide also increased(https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7015a3.htm) dramatically.An educational analysis by McKinsey and Company(https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/education/our-insights/covid-19-and-education-the-lingering-effects-of-unfinished-learning) indicated that K-12 students were on average five months behind in mathematics and four months behind in reading, with students of colour being most greatly impacted in all grade levels. Even three month school closures may leave students behind by a full year(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738059320304855) over the long term and, based on data from Second World War(https://uh.edu/~adkugler/Ichino%26Winter-Ebmer.pdf) school closures, could affect their earning potential 40 years down the road.There are also growing concerns(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666535221001221#bib5) of detrimental impacts on language development and well-being from long-term masking in children. A large observational pre-print study(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.19.21257467v1) analyzing data from the COVID-19 School Response Dashboard did not find any correlations between COVID-19 rates and mask mandates. Another study out of Spain(https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Fulltext/2021/11000/Age_dependency_of_the_Propagation_Rate_of.2.aspx) failed to find any increase in COVID-19 cases in kids under six years old, who all remained unmasked, compared to older cohorts, which were required to wear masks.Students with English as a second language, autism, hearing loss or speech and language delay are the most negatively impacted by continued masking in schools, as are children with behavioural challenges. That in some schools children are required to mask outdoors, while running or playing sports, shows just how inhumane and unrealistic these mandates can be.Of note, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control does not recommend(https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/questions-answers/questions-answers-school-transmission) masks for children in primary school and only recommends face masks for children over 12 years old in secondary schools situated in areas with community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The recent Health Canada approval of the Pfizer vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 is good news, as long as it is used to support, and not further restrict, children. It is important to leave space for families to make informed decisions based on their personal contexts, and not to use this as an opportunity to impose vaccine mandates on school children.School-based COVID-19 vaccine mandates could unintentionally result in widening socioeconomic disparities. If mandates are imposed, children of parents who wish to wait for additional vaccine safety data stand to pay a very large price for a decision that's entirely out of their hands. Children who will inevitably be pulled from the public school system because of vaccination mandates could miss out on critical academic and athletic opportunities, in addition to being separated from their friends and established social networks.In fact, in its recommendation(https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/recommendations-use-covid-19-vaccines/pfizer-biontech-10-mcg-children-5-11-years-age.html) of the pediatric vaccine, the National Advisory Committee for Immunization stated, \"Given the short-term uncertainties surrounding pediatric vaccination at this time, children and their parents or guardians should be supported and respected in their decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccinations for the child, whatever decisions they make, and should not be stigmatized for accepting, or not accepting, the vaccination offer.\"When it comes to children and COVID-19, the data are reassuring. Coming together to do the best thing for our children should involve an honest and apolitical look at the science, including both the risks to children from COVID-19 as well as the risks from disease mitigation measures. The latter also pose serious short- and long-term health risks, especially for children with special needs and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds.Given that all adults now have access to effective vaccines that will protect them against severe outcomes, it is time to finally focus on what is best for our children and allow them to have a rapid return to normalcy.National PostDr. Tracy Hoeg is an associate researcher at UC Davis in physical medicine &; rehabilitation with PhD in epidemiology and public health, as well as a practising sports medicine physician.
