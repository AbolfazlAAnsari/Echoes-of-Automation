Needless to say, investment shrinks from confusion and uncertainty.\"Facilities-based providers\" are those that own or operate their own telecommunications systems. Think Bell, Rogers, Shaw, Eastlink, or Telus. Without a regulatory framework that provides certainty, they will likely hesitate to make the long-term investments 5G requires.Timothy Denton: Time to change Canada's failed telecom strategy(https://financialpost.com/opinion/timothy-denton-time-to-change-canadas-failed-telecom-strategy)Terence Corcoran: Another nail in the coffin of the fourth-carrier dream(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-another-nail-in-the-coffin-of-the-fourth-carrier-dream)Opinion: The new Broadcasting Act is about speech control over the internet(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-the-new-broadcasting-act-is-about-speech-control-over-the-internet)Opinion: Canadian telecoms' value for money is actually among the highest in the world(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-canadian-telecoms-value-for-money-actually-among-the-highest-in-the-world)What does international experience with mandated access suggests? Boston Consulting Group's global review(https://media-publications.bcg.com/flash/dotbcg_other/CCF%20Digital%20Infrastructure-%20In%20the%20Balance.pdf?web=1&;wdLOR=c835E0931-D445-45FF-A50A-833D0C45E5BB) showed that capital intensity could fall by up to 25 per cent. The result would be an investment gap in wireline and wireless capital expenditures of $2 billion in 2021. In a separate study looking just at Canadian implications of the same decision, TD Securities has estimated(https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/vwapj/CRTC-2019-288-Attachment-1.pdf/$file/CRTC-2019-288-Attachment-1.pdf) a similarly sized drop in investment in wireline investment.If the rollout of next-generation broadband and wireless infrastructure ends up being delayed, Canadian consumers and businesses will lack access to these world-leading digital technologies, which means we risk stumbling in the global economic race with other countries.Expedient deployment of the next generation of digital infrastructure is therefore an economic imperative. The federal government must provide facilities-based telecom companies with a clear and predictable regulatory framework that balances vigorous and sustainable price competition with incentives for continuing investments to improve network and service quality.Benjamin Dachis is Director of Public Affairs at the C.D.
