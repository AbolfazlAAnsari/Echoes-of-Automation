People don't go to church as often and they no longer trust their government. Young men who don't have jobs -- who aren't attached to work, to school, to a mate -- are much more likely to embrace misogynistic content.Let's start with education. Men now account for41% of college enrollments, down from nearly 60% in 1970. If we talk about graduation rates, it gets even worse: Since men drop out at a faster clip than women, in the next five years there might be two female college graduates for every one male.Fewer men going to college means fewer men on pathways to economic prosperity. College-educated men earn a median$900,000 more over their lifetimesthan those who only graduated from high school. And that has implications for their prospects of forming meaningful relationships.Boys also face unique threats which have been getting more ominous in recent years -- and they are ill prepared for these challenges by a culture that conflates masculinity with toxicity and aggression with strength.Men aretwice as likely to overdose, three and a half times more likely tocommit suicideand are more thannine times more likely to be incarcerated.Recent studies revealthat more than nine in 10 of mass violent attackers were male, and more than two thirds of them were under the age of 35. The most dangerous person in the world is a broke and alone young male.The reduction of economic pathways for young people is no less serious for women, but it appears to be less dangerous: When young women feel shame and rage, they don't grab AR-15s.My advice to young men? Take 4-6 hours from the time that you spend on your phone -- or on Twitter or Coinbase -- and reallocate it to a few things:1) Start making money. We live in a capitalist society. The way to make a lot of money is by just starting to make some.2) Get super strong. You want to be fit, you want to lift heavy weights and run long distances in your mind and in the gym. You should be able to walk in any room and believe that you can eat everybody's lunch -- or at least outrun them.3) Finally, get out there: Church groups, softball league, riding class, whatever. Commit to meeting people, and quite frankly, try to have sex.What's the elemental foundation of any society? Relationships. Find relationships. Get out there.
