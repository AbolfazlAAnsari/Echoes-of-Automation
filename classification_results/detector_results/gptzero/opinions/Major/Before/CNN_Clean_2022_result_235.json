Per CDC data, the number of children who required hospitalization, many of whom were under the age of 5 and ineligible for vaccination, alsoincreased precipitouslyduring that time to the highest levels since the onset of the pandemic.A CDCreportshowed infants and children ages 0 to 4 were hospitalized at approximately five times the rate of the previous peak during Delta variant predominance. And even now,nearly 88,000child Covid cases were reported just last week, reports AAP.While taking my daughter out for a stroll, a neighbor, who is up to date with his Covid-19 vaccines, approached us and shared how he got infected with Covid-19 a month ago and is suffering fromlong Covid. He's experiencing low energy levels, shortness of breath after engaging in minimal activities and episodes of brain fog -- enough to disrupt his daily routine.While it remains unclear how many children go on to develop long Covid,studies suggestthat it's between 2% and 10% of those infected with the virus, but the number may be larger. A growing list of studies are showing that Covid-19 vaccinationreduces the risk of long Covid(though this hasn't specifically been shown in kids). And aCDC report notedthat two doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine reduced the risk of MIS-C in children ages 12 to 18 by 91% during a time when the Delta variant was dominant.Thereality of long Covidis enough for me as a parent to want to protect my children from getting Covid in first place. We still go out as a family and enjoy most of the activities we did pre-pandemic, apart from now avoiding high risk activities in areas of high community transmission with our daughter. She can't tolerate wearing a mask consistently, so my husband and I decided not to take trips that requires her to be around large groups of individuals until she is vaccinated.While the vaccines are great, they're not foolproof, and the risk of contracting Covid-19 is still a possibility. But lowering the chance of my child suffering from any illness, especially a trip to the hospital, is still a step in the right direction.Many people have put the pandemic behind them, but for the youngest children, the threat posed by this virus still looms. A Kaiser Family Foundationsurvey from Aprilshows just 18% of parents say they will get their child under 5 vaccinated as soon as a Covid-19 vaccine is authorized in their age group. The next hurdle will be to educate parents and caregivers and to address all their questions and concerns about these vaccines.If the29%of 5-11-year-olds who, according to the AAP, have now received two doses of Covid-19 vaccine are any indication, this will not be an easy task. Misinformation still runs rampant. To get ahead of the predictable misinformation and disinformation that will ensue by fringe groups to undermine confidence in the vaccines, we must ensure timely and accurate vaccination messages are ready to go by health care providers, public health institutions and pediatric groups, and that social media platforms can readily connect parents to this information.We have waited over a year to get to this pivotal moment for these young kids -- now that a vaccine is authorized, we must do everything we can to get shots into these little arms.This piece has been updated to reflect the FDA's emergency use authorization of Pfizer's and Moderna's  Covid-19 vaccines for children as young as 6 months.Opinion by Syra MadadTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
