All this, just as the world enters a post-COVID economic recovery and countries like Britain and Canada need growth and investment more than ever.The junk food ad ban was pushed through in the U.K. on the back of a sinister campaign weaponizing children's voices. As the government wrapped up its public consultation on the proposal, it lauded a conveniently timed report supposedly highlighting the crying need for such a drastic policy intervention. The report(https://www.biteback2030.com/real-story/new-analysis-end -junk-food-marketing-online ) - or \"exposÃ©,\"' as it was branded - was cooked up by Biteback 2030, a pressure group fronted by celebrity chefs and Dolce &; Gabbana models. Absent hard evidence or coherent arguments for the centralization of decision-making on a matter as fundamental as what to have for dinner, it made its point by shamelessly putting interventionist politics into children's mouths.\"I'm a 16-year-old boy,\" read its introduction. \"I feel like I'm being bombarded with junk food ads on my phone and on my computer. And I'm pretty sure this is getting worse.\" Canadians who value free markets and individual liberties should be on the lookout for similar tactics from nanny-statists bent on drowning entire industries in red tape and consigning any notion of freedom of choice to the history books.

The ban completely ignores the other half of the obesity equation, which is of course physical activity.Obesity is a serious problem. It could even become the next pandemic. But as this junk food ad ban statement from Health Canada shows, powerful public health regulators are asleep at the wheel. They claim to be acting in Canadians' best interest but they have nothing new to add to the policy debate.David Clement is North American affairs manager at the Consumer Choice Center.
