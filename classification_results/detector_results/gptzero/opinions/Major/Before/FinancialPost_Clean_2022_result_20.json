            "inputText": "When Russia's invasion of Ukraine was imminent, western governments made it clear to Putin that if he went through with his plan, severe economic sanctions would be imposed. The Russian President called the bluff. Ukraine was invaded on February 24 and the axe of sanctions came down the next day. Now Russia's economy is suffering.From the basement of my house near Kyiv where my family is currently sheltering from nightly air raids by Russian aircraft, I take little comfort in the suffering of the Russian people. After-all, the crippling sanctions that have been imposed upon them have not impeded the destruction of Ukraine. They have not hindered Russia's indiscriminate bombing of infrastructure, schools, hospitals, and homes. They have not obstructed Putin's invading troops from advancing on Kyiv and other major cities (mind you, the Ukrainian army has done an excellent job of that). In the final analysis, sanctions have not prevented death.Granted, sanctions have significantly diminished Russia's ability to wage war. At the start of hostilities, no one believed the Ukrainians had a fighting chance. Meanwhile, our forces have inflicted significant losses on the invader, and have stopped Russia's ground assault on Kyiv in its tracks. Bodies of dead Russian soldiers fill our morgues to capacity, and special refrigerated rail cars have been ordered to ship them home.With his ground assault halted, Putin has unleashed missiles. Unlike armoured vehicles and tanks which are available in seemingly endless numbers in the Russian military, high tech rockets are less abundant in Putin's arsenal. But no doubt he will continue to launch what he has. Ukraine's cities will not be occupied, but they will be gradually destroyed. For this, sanctions are not a deterrent.Putin cannot afford to lose this war. He cannot afford to allow Ukraine to exist as a democracy in its internationally defined borders. For Putin, to lose his war in Ukraine would be to shame himself, to shame his country, to write himself out of history. He has staked his entire presidency on \"gathering the Russian lands,\" on effecting the disappearance of Ukraine as a separate state from Russia. If only the Ukrainians would submit! But we won't.When cornered in Ukraine in the past, Putin has consistently engaged in \"escalation commitment\": he offset the negative consequences of annexing Crimea in 2014 (limited sanctions) by escalating in the Donbas. Failure to bring Ukraine to its knees through attrition in that eight-year local war was compensated by invasion of all of Ukraine. Failure in Ukraine will inevitably be followed by escalation on a global scale: by testing NATO's resolve in the Baltic countries or elsewhere.Lately, a poignant meme has been circulating through Ukraine's social media:\"World War Three has already started. On one side we have Russia against the civilized world, and on the other Ukraine, defending the civilized world.\"This is particularly relevant after the official announcement by NATO of its refusal to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. The West has placed its bet on sanctions crippling Russia. It won't work.Eventually, you (NATO countries) will have to enter this war directly. The no-fly zone idea provided an opportunity to do it on your terms. Now the initiative will be with Putin: he will escalate in the way that he chooses, and you will have to respond.If the goal of sanctions was to prevent war and suffering, they have failed. Granted, the Russian economy has been punished, but the idea underpinning the West's strategy of instituting massive economic sanctions was based on two premises that have turned out to be false:1) That Putin cares about the wellbeing of his people (he doesn't)2) That the Russian people (or the oligarchs around him) will rise up against Putin if their wellbeing suffers significantly.The vast majority of Russians have never travelled beyond Russia. They receive their information from state television, and from Kremlin-controlled websites. These media are now telling them that the world has turned against Russia. The \"evil West\" is responsible for inflicting hardship on ordinary (innocent) Russians.In Russian popular discourse Putin embodies Russia. Indeed, according to the Russian president's press secretary, \"There can be no Russia without Putin.\" By sanctioning the Russian economy, the West has attacked Putin-Russia. And the natural reaction of many ordinary Russians is patriotic consolidation.If the hope was/is that sanctions will lead to a \"palace coup\" by the oligarchs, that too is highly unlikely. With the population firmly behind him, Putin will act with impertinence to destroy any suspected plotters. And the latter will be deathly afraid to cross him. None of Russia's elite have forgotten Putin's ability and eagerness to kill suspected opponents, including when they hide oversees.Don't get me wrong! The extensive sanctions imposed upon Russia by the West are highly appreciated by Ukrainians: we are grateful for all military, economic and diplomatic aid provided by Canada and other friends of Ukraine.Sanctions have proven to be a powerful means of punishment. They are a long-term policy instrument that eventually will affect Russia's ability to fight. But sanctions will neither deter nor end war. And whether our friends in the West realize it or not, you are already at war with Russia.Machiavelli famously wrote: \"There is no avoiding war, it can only be postponed to the advantage of your enemy.\"In war, initiative is key.
