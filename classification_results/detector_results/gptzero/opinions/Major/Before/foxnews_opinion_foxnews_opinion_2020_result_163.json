Patients taking the stomach antacid famotidine (the generic name for Pepcid)appear to do better, as well as those who have normalvitamin D levels.Dexamethasone and proper ventilator management save the lives of COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized. And the just-approvedanti-viral drug remdesivir— as well as various monoclonal antibodies against the virus (still in clinical trials) — appear to save lives early before the coronavirus has had a chance to replicate and cause the inflammatory and blood clotting effects that we so fear.National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins, who is one of the top geneticists in the world, told me in an interview that there is a genetic variation in susceptibility to severe COVID-19 from one person to the next. Dr. Collins cited differences in the way interferon (a protein we make to help block viral spread from cell to cell) works that may led to an exciting new therapeutic.Useful vaccines able to protect most people contracting COVID-19 are now undergoing clinical trials and appear to be only a few months away from development. Once vaccines that the Food and Drug Administration determines are safe and effective are given to a large percentage of the population, we should be able to develop herd immunity from the disease.When we have FDA-approved vaccines, all elected officials — regardless of political party —should line up in support of FDA recommendations and urge all Americans who the FDA says can safely get vaccinated to do so. This is vitally important, because widespread vaccinations will be needed to end the pandemic.Right now we must focus our attention on complying with distancing, disinfecting and masking to combat the spread of COVID-19. We should avoid the politics of fear that erodes our confidence in the war against the coronavirus. We must neither deny the value of masks nor embrace them dogmatically as a religion.CLICK HERE FOR MORE BY DR.
