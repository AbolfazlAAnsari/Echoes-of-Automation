Panel member Anne McLellan, a former Alberta Liberal MP who now serves as an advisor to Trudeau on matters like SNC Lavalin, is an experienced and reliable defender of Liberal governments.To judge from a backgrounder(https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2020/07/independent-review-panel-for-april-tragedy.html) that accompanied the announcement of the review, the two governments are more interested in questions of sociology than in competent policing and the RCMP's history of repeated failures. It features a long discourse on the \"restorative principles\" that \"will help guide the panel members to carry out their work in a manner sensitive to the needs of those most impacted.\"There follows an effusion of bulleted phrases from some PowerPoint deck of socio-babble catch phrases: \"Comprehensive, holistic/integrative,\" \"working in integrated, not siloed or fragmented ways,\" \"inclusive and participatory,\" \"attentive to first voice,\" \"trauma-informed,\" \"culturally aware,\" \"needs-based,\" \"inclusive and participatory.\" And of course, \"proactive.\"The backgrounder does not explain how a review can be \"inclusive and participatory\" when public hearings are not contemplated and release of evidence is explicitly forbidden.Furey and Blair, who took three months to come up with Thursday's announcement, cited a need for haste as the reason for calling a \"review.\" A real inquiry would take too long to set up, Furey said. He also cited the \"sensitivities\" of the victims' family members, 300 of whom marched on the Bible Hill, N.S., RCMP office Wednesday demanding a public inquiry.A reporter asked the ministers whether, after taking three months to come up with a \"timely\" process, and ignoring the wishes of victims' families, \"you worry that you are bringing the general administration of justice in this country into disrepute?\"Blair responded with a paean of praise for the courage of the Mounties - a remarkable display of independence and open-mindedness on the part of the responsible minister.There is no reason to expect this dentition-challenged review might recommend the RCMP meet the same fate as the ignominiously disbanded Canadian Airborne Regiment.Furey says Nova Scotia will not be judged by the Portapique horror, but by the government's response to it. He's right. The flimsy review announced Thursday, with none of the powers of an actual inquiry, abdicates responsibility and accountability. In a functioning democracy, it would lead to swift defeat for the government of Premier Stephen McNeil. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2020 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved."
