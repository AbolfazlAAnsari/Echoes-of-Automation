Stock options are a key form of compensation in many industries, particularly those characterized by entrepreneurial and innovative activities where financial outcomes are uncertain. Since both the likelihood and timing of commercial success are difficult to determine at the outset, linking financial rewards (e.g. stock options) to successful outcomes is a more efficient and practical way to compensate talent compared to predetermined compensation such as salaries or \"tax holidays.\" Individuals with superior skills and strong motivation to succeed are more likely to prefer a financial reward framework where compensation is differentiated based on actual outcomes rather than potential performance.Indeed, the Trudeau government seems to recognize this since it exempts startups and similar companies from the rules. However, there are problems with the government's implicit argument that only startups should be eligible for this deduction.First, startup companies are not the only competitors for talented scientists and engineers. Medium-sized and large Canadian technology companies, which exceed the $500-million revenue threshold in the new rules, also hire such workers and will therefore be disadvantaged when competing for talent. Furthermore, while startups are an important source of innovation, established and larger firms (such as Shopify, a Canadian e-commerce company headquartered in Ottawa) can also make important contributions to technological change - and they also compete for talent. Finally, the eligibility criterion adds complexity to an already complex tax code, while increasing compliance costs for firms that must navigate the new rules.The proposed tax change will exacerbate Canada's tax disadvantage relative to U.S. locations.

Limiting stock option deductibility is therefore a particularly damaging tax, as it reduces after-tax compensation tied to innovation. Immigrants with the talent and inclination to be successful innovators and entrepreneurs will see Canada as a less desirable location and Canada's economic growth rate will suffer as a consequence.If Canada is serious about becoming a top destination for global talent, the economic incentives to attract and retain high-skilled scientists and engineers must align with this worthy goal.
