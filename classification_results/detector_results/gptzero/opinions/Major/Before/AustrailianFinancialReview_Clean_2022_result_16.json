            "inputText": "Pearls of wisdomfrom JS JacquesPerhaps bored at home being unemployable, former Rio Tinto chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques penned an opinion column last month for the website of storied American magazine Fortune.His piece was about corporate culture. Of all the subjects Jacques might be qualified to opine on, this certainly isn't one of them.\"CEOs should ditch fear - and play to win\", it was titled. Jacques, of course, presided over a culture of rampant fear at Rio Tinto; what an independent inquiry by Elizabeth Broderick found was a systemic organisational culture of bullying, harassment and racism. He commenced his tenure as CEO in 2016 by warning the company's workforce to \"fit in or f--- off\".\"Managing under the microscope of culture warriors and ESG evangelists has clearly rattled senior executives,\" Jacques noted of his former peers astride the corporate world, while adding disdainfully that, \"Sure, it's tempting to embrace every passing tenet of ESG and please the crowd.\"Funny, because we remember Jacques saying in February 2019 that \"with the sale of our coal assets last year, we are now the only major mining company with a fossil fuel-free portfolio, which means we are well-positioned to contribute to a low-carbon future\".Oh yes, Jacques was a real crowd pleaser on ESG. He left billions of dollars of profit on the table by exiting coal but was lauded at all the best sustainability roundtables in the City of London.He convinced a battalion of duffers in the investment community that Rio was \"differentiated from our industry peers, with a fundamentally changed exposure to environmental, social and governance risks\" even though Rio remained the biggest polluter in Australian mining courtesy of its dreaded aluminium business (they don't call it \"solid electricity\" for nothing).\"CEOs face decisions familiar to football players,\" Jacques' column continued. \"They can play to win, or just play not to lose. Playing to win requires risk-taking, steady communication, and agility. Playing not to lose means crouching into a defensive stance, trying not to rock the boat, and avoiding making the tough calls.\"Again, Jacques is not exactly evoking his own record in these depictions of an ideal leader.Crouching in a defensive stance is precisely what Jacques did after Rio Tinto detonated the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in May 2020. He did not utter a word for three entire weeks. He hid under his bed like a coward. Only after a series of iterative, disingenuous, pedantic and qualified apologies from the mining giant had provoked escalating anger did Jacques finally put his name to a written statement. He still did not front a camera or a microphone.These are all important lessons on how to be a CEO from one who left a proud business in smouldering ruins - at least in terms of its community standing. Jacques put Rio Tinto's reputation so deep in the toilet it was beyond the S-bend.RepTrak polling for the June quarter has Rio at 57 out of 60 major Australian brands, underperformed only by the NBN, Crown Resorts and News Corp Australia. That's two full years since Juukan Gorge, but just five months since the Broderick report lifted the lid on Rio's \"culture of silence\".The truth is that CEOs can learn nothing from football players. Running a company is not akin to a game. The analogy is inane, much like its author. And didn't Rio Tinto learn that the hard way?The curious case of Medibank's disappearing ransomware guardMedibank Private's incarnation as Australia's most demoralised brand now seems beyond doubt, given its security failings allowed cyber slopsuckers to waltz into a room of Australia's most intimate medical details, such as drug dependency and abortion history.And to be fair, it does seem Medibank took many steps to guard against malicious attacks.For instance, in 2019, Medibank's then chief information security officer, Stuart Harrison, gave an interview with tech media outfit FST, in which he presciently noted that: \"Given the sensitive nature of information insurers often hold, the highest threat is the potential compromise of someone's privacy. As far as industry preparedness is concerned, the answer is: it depends.\" We guess that answer can now be updated.At the time, Harrison (who left in 2021 to become NBN Australia's general manager of cyber defence), had just headed a revamp of Medibank's cybersecurity strategy.That included a 2018 tender for ransomware cybersecurity tools where it ultimately landed on provider Carbon Black, which was acquired in 2019 by Californian cloud computing group VMware.Carbon Black was evidently satisfied with its work at the country's largest health insurer. A promotional pamphlet posted to VMware's website later described Medibank's use of its \"dynamic approach to endpoint security\" as a \"success story\".It detailed how Medibank was suffering an average of between two and three ransomware attacks that were bypassing the company's existing antivirus products quarterly. Since deploying Carbon Black, 100 per cent of ransomware attack attempts were prevented.That all sounds pretty good. Which is why it seems odd that VMware appears to have since deleted the Medibank material from its website. A note declaring \"Page Not Found\" is all that remains. Hmm.Internet archives show the material was still online as recently as May, though it remains unclear as to how long after that it disappeared.Nevertheless, we would hope it wasn't after Medibank first disclosed the hack on its systems on October 13 (since suspected to have been launched by a ransomware group with ties to the Russian-speaking REvil cybercrime gang).That would be a bad look. Not unlike when VMware last month settled charges by the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it misled investors by, err, obscuring its financial reports, a violation of anti-fraud provisions. Whoops!We can't imagine the missing Medibank testimonial on VMware's website had anything to do with wanting to avoid association with ground zero of Australia's worst cyberattack.Indeed, no one has even pointed the finger at Carbon Black (which has a good reputation) as being part of Medibank's vulnerability. Rather, the crooks' own messages with Medibank name-checked two systems, being Atlassian's Confluence, and Amazon Web Services' RedShift. And with an independent review only just launched, it's unlikely we'll know where fault lies for some time.VMware on Thursday didn't respond to our multiple queries. Though we understand Medibank was told by VMware that it wasn't unusual for it to rotate marketing materials on its website. Well, this one rotated right out of existence!It's not like VMWare is exactly ducking for cover at the moment. Indeed, it took out space reserved for sponsored content in The Australian Financial Review on Monday, where the company's local managing director Brad Anderson called for greater government investment in technology skills.We can't say it isn't an opportune time to be pushing that particular barrow."
