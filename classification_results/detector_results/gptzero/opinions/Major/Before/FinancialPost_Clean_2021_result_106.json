Such entities would pool global IP assets for strategic defence of Alberta's companies as they expand globally and protect the IP that has been generated by taxpayer-supported research.The government could also establish data trusts for such key sectors as energy, cleantech and agriculture. Data trusts are entities that collect information in a central data facility that is authorized to make such data available to parties interested in using it for designated purposes including economic advancement, research, public-sector planning and social benefit.If this sounds like big government socialism, remember that this kind of approach is nothing new. The Alberta government has played the critical role in unlocking the energy sector with an energy and utilities board in the 1930s, pipeline infrastructure in the 1950s, industrial research in the 1970s and 1980s (AOSTRA), and in contemporary cleantech strategies.If the Alberta government is serious about its commitment to traditional industries, it must once again play its leadership role, helping those sectors reap the full benefit of innovation. No matter whether it is traditional or emerging industries, Alberta needs to be positioned for success in the 21st-century knowledge-based economy.BrontÃ© Valk leads the Alberta practice of the Council of Canadian Innovators, a national business council representing more than 140 of Canada's fastest-growing technology companies. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
