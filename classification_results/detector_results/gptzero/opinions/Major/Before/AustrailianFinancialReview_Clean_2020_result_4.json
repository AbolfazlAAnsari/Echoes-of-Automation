            "inputText": "Outcomes Peace and prosperity allowed identity politics to flourish. Now a real crisis that doesn't discriminate might tear the social fabric.You've had a great run since the end of the Cold War. Living standards have risen, absolute poverty has fallen to its lowest level in history, life expectancy has expanded, democracy has triumphed, and there has been a substantial decline in the number of people killed in combat. It hasn't been an era without problems, but it has been for humanity a golden era. In the preceding 90 years, our forebears lived through world wars, depressions, pandemics, short life expectancy, famines and high levels of global poverty.For a while, in the West at least, we celebrated the triumph of a liberal democratic philosophy. We lauded our ability to judge all people by the content of their character not the colour of their skin. We were proud of our economic system which, although not flawless, put consumer choice ahead of the diktats of politicians and generated our prosperity. We knew that for all sorts of reasons different people have different opinions and we also knew that suppressing dissent was a short path to the totalitarianism we had overthrown.But as the years wore on, we became used to prosperity and an easy way of life. We abandoned some of the basic philosophical beliefs and many started drifting into a kind of illiberal liberalism. Not only did we start to abandon once-sacrosanct concepts like freedom of speech and expression, we replaced the obnoxious practices of racial and gender discrimination with an equally obnoxious and immoral practice of reverse discrimination. We couldn't see how daft it was to oppose discrimination as immoral and to support discrimination as acceptable. We divided society into two: the privileged and the victims. And then we salami-sliced the victims by race, gender and sexuality.We thought only of ourselves and forgot the basic ingredients of a successful liberal democratic society.And then it happened! COVID-19 arrived and the world was faced not with superstition and hocus-pocus but with a very real crisis. Suddenly, we were plunged back into an era when large numbers of lives were at risk. Complacency caught up with us and now we have to make sacrifices the likes of which the past two generations have never had to bother.There's never been a harder task than to forecast the impact of COVID-19 on politics, economics and international relations.For now, the public in all Western countries are going along with the recommendations of chief medical officers and their governments. Societies are being plunged into isolation, institutions closed down and life disrupted in ways we haven't seen before. All the advice suggests that the harder we lock down, the more effective it will be in dealing with the spread of COVID-19. And the faster we deal with the spread of COVID-19, the less damage to the economy.For now, it's all a mild inconvenience, a novelty. For those office workers who can now work from home rather than commute backwards and forwards to an office, there is even a short-term benefit.But this will all change. Human beings are social animals. After a while, not seeing friends and family and spending time out at the pub or in restaurants, going to sports events and cultural festivals will have quite a psychological impact on people. They will become depressed and dispirited. I'm sorry to say that because I'm usually an optimist, but this time I can see a minimum of three grim months ahead of us.As small businesses gradually go broke, people lose their jobs, living standards plunge and access to the outside world becomes virtual rather than real, it's hard to believe the community attitudes will remain static. If the harsh measures to try to knock out coronavirus work, then with the assistance of government financial packages this will be seen as a temporary drama from which most of us will recover. But if these measures don't work effectively and quickly, then a great degree of disquiet and fractiousness will spread throughout the community. It's hard to know where that will lead.Already I think it is clear that three things will emerge from an ultimately successful campaign to defeat the coronavirus.First, the public will be reminded that when it comes to dire emergencies we have no choice but to depend on our own communities. The nation state has to take up the cudgels and fight the battle.In the war against the coronavirus, the United Nations offers press conferences and press releases which I barely noticed. It's national governments that have to deal with the borders, which have to deal with the spread of the disease. So this fancy idea that somehow the nation state and quiet patriotism don't matter any more - that they have been abolished by globalisation - will now be dispelled for another generation.The public never liked this idea of abandoning the nation state and the denigration of patriotism. Well, there you are. The quiet common sense of ordinary people was right after all. They have been trying to say that throughout the Western world through the ballot box over the past few years. Maybe now, the metro elites will listen to them, not despise them.Second, it's taken a major health crisis to remind us that all people are of equal value regardless of gender, race or sexual preference. The coronavirus has no respect for identity politics. It goes after us all!And finally, there is China. As time wears on and the pain deepens, criticism of China as the source of COVID-19 will intensify. Every crisis begins with shock, is followed by the response and finally ends with the blame game. No one is going to blame the Australian government or any Western leader for this. Instead there will be growing criticism of the lack of biosecurity standards in China. The SARS epidemic started in China in late 2002 and now COVID-19 has as well. At a minimum, the world will demand reassurance from the Chinese government that it will improve its food safety standards, including in public markets.This has come at a time when there is already rising tension between the West and China over trade, cyber security, intellectual property and broader security issues. The COVID-19 crisis is doing more damage to Western economies than to China's but in time it will have done China's soft power, its prestige and its influence severe damage.Alexander Downer was Australia's foreign minister, from 1996 to 2007, and most recently Australian high commissioner to the UK."
