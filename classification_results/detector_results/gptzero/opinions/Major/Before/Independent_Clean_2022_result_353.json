Counterfactual scenarios are always tricky, but what evidence is there that had Nato behaved more sensitively, the war unleashed in February would not have happened? So long as the Russian leadership fantasised about its great power status, any evidence of Nato backing down would perhaps have made Russia more rather than less aggressive. This indeed seems to be the lesson to be learned from its easy occupation of the Crimea.So, sadly, perhaps peace in Europe will not be achieved by making Russia feel safe but rather by Russia learning that the Brezhnev Doctrine is dead.Christopher OuseyClarbeston"
