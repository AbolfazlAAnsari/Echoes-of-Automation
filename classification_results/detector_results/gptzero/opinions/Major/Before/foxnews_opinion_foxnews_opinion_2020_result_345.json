And why is a bishop who lived almost 1,600 years ago still important to us today?You may know Patrick as the patron saint ofIreland. You may have heard that he brought Christianity to the Emerald Isle. And you’ve no doubt heard all about the snakes and the shamrocks and other myths associated with him.NYC'S ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE POSTPONED FOR 1ST TIME IN HISTORY OVER CORONAVIRUS FEARSBut the real reason he still matters today is that his life demonstrates the call of God to share the Good News of the Gospel. And God still speaks to us today, if we’re willing to listen.Most of what we know about Patrick comes from his autobiographical Confession, which he wrote when a group of bishops in Britain tried to bring charges against him.Patrick was in danger of losing everything he had worked for in Ireland, and the Confession became his defense so that others could “understand that to which I have committed my soul.”The real reason he still matters today is that his life demonstrates the call of God to share the Good News of the Gospel. And God still speaks to us today, if we’re willing to listen.The Confession begins with humility: “I am Patrick, a sinner, the most unsophisticated of people, the least among all the Christians, and among some, the most contemptible.”Saint Patrick, played by Marty Burns, sails past Down Cathedral as the re-enactment of the first landing of Saint Patrick on Irish shores takes place at Inch Abbey on March 12, 2017, in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland.

As the son of an official in the Roman Empire, he was born into privilege. But when he was just a child, he was kidnapped by the Irish and sold into slavery.In captivity, Patrick saw God’s hand in delivering him “out of a way of life where God didn’t matter for me.”Now a slave in a foreign land, overwhelmed by loneliness and starvation, he had a revelation: “There, the Lord opened up my understanding to my unbelief so that however late, I might become conscious of my failings and then remembering my need, I might turn with all my heart to the Lord my God.”After six years as a slave, Patrick heard a voice telling him to escape, and he miraculously made his way to freedom in Britain. For the next 18 years, Patrick dedicated his life to the church and became a bishop. Then he had another vision calling him back to Ireland to preach the Gospel.Gothic Cathedral of St. Patrick.If you are a Christian of Irish or Scottish descent, you owe your Christianity to St. Patrick. You may also owe him your education.One of Patrick’s goals was for the Irish to become a people who could read the Bible. Patrick was known as a man of the Book, and the scriptures are scattered throughout his writings.In the fifth century, few could read, and many ancient writings, including the Bible, fell into disuse and were in danger of being lost.Left Photo: Croagh Patrick, mountain in Westport, Ireland which is subject to an annual pilgrimage every July in honour of Saint Patrick.

God still calls, and God still sends. God still wants to shake us “out of a way of life where God didn’t matter.”On March 17, the traditional day of Patrick’s death, let us celebrate the remarkable life of a slave who committed his life to God. With God’s help, Patrick changed a nation. Through Patrick’s example, may we realize that we can change nations as well.
