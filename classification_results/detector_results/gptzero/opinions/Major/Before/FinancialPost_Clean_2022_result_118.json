Three even expressed concern about being included on a \"jump list\" (a list of people targeted for attack) allegedly being circulated by students.York Memorial is obviously an extreme case. But it's far from the only school where students and teachers feel unsafe. Saunders Secondary School in London, Ontario, has also gained a reputation(https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/saunders-school-violence-concerns-1.6425753) for violence, with students regularly challenging teachers to fistfights. Again, violence this extreme is rare, but students and teachers across Canada often feel unsafe during the school day.Why? Because many school administrators adopt lax disciplinary policies that keep consequences for misbehaviour as light as possible. For example, the education(https://financialpost.com/tag/education/) director for the Thames Valley District School Board (which includes Saunders Secondary School) wants to reduce the number of student suspensions(https://lfpress.com/news/local-news/slashing-student-suspensions-top-priority-for-thames-valley-school-board) and focus instead on \"responsive, equitable, and restorative practices.\" As a result, misbehaving students face little or no discipline.The Toronto District School Board's director of education has a similarly myopic view. In her latest report(https://pub-tdsb.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=14791), she pledged to take \"an intersectional perspective which aims to eliminate disproportionate outcomes for students.\" This type of woke bafflegab is the last thing students need right now.To make matters worse, Toronto school trustees recently ruled out(https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2022/12/08/tdsb-rules-out-return-of-armed-police-in-school-hallways-amid-rising-student-violence.html) reviving their defunct School Resource Officer program, which means that unless school administrators call the police to report a crime, York Memorial (home of the \"jump list\") will have no police presence in the school.Opinion: A climate loss-and-damage fund? What could possibly go wrong?(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-a-climate-loss-and-damage-fund-what-could-possibly-go-wrong)Matthew Lau: Parliament's economic blockheads weigh in on food prices(https://financialpost.com/opinion/matthew-lau-parliament-economic-blockheads-food-prices)Opinion: Cities have to expand for house prices to fall(https://financialpost.com/opinion/cities-expand-house-prices-fall)In some schools, the situation is clearly out of control, thanks in part to school board policy. If school administrators cannot make their schools safe, parents and students will soon be looking for other options. Unfortunately, for many Ontario parents education options are limited. Ontario is one of five provinces that still refuses to allow public money (i.e., taxpayer money) to follow the student. If a student transfers out of a public school and enrolls in an independent school, his or her parents must cover the full cost of tuition - in addition to paying their regular school taxes.In effect, these parents pay twice for their children's education: once to the district that has failed them and once to the independent school that has taken over educating their child. Not surprisingly, independent schools in Ontario are largely the purview of upper-middle-income households and higher. That needs to change. At the very least, every province should make it easier for parents to enroll their children in schools that are safe and provide a better education. All parents, not just wealthy ones, should be able to choose the right school for their children.If Ontario were to inject more choice(https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/heres-what-school-choice-in-ontario-could-look-like-for-parents) into its public school system by having the money follow the child, complacent administrators and trustees might finally listen to the concerns of parents and instill more discipline and common sense into the province's public schools, which these days are making headlines for all the wrong reasons.In the meantime, school trustees should think more seriously about who they hire for key administrative roles. Far too many school administrators espouse woke ideology that promotes a lax disciplinary approach and divisive curriculum. Schools plagued by violence need a significant change in direction. Keeping students and teachers safe in school is an absolute must.Michael Zwaagstra, a senior fellow with the Fraser Institute, teaches in a public high school. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
