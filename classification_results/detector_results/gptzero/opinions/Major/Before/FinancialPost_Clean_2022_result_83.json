            "inputText": "In back-to-school season, you are bound to find media commentary calling for the defunding of religious schools. To cite one example among many this year, Globe columnist Marsha Lederman recently asked(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-religious-schools-can-be-good-but-they-shouldnt-get-public-funds/): \"In our secular society, why is any province funding religious schools? And why on Earth are we subsidizing private schools that are out of reach for most families?\"Lederman's question was rhetorical but in fact there are good answers to it from global, historical, and cultural perspectives.Let's start globally. In 100 countries, representing 94 per cent of the world's population, taxpayers fund independent schools at least partially. In the United States, taxpayer funding for private school choice is available in 32 states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Among OECD countries, only Greece denies all financial support for non-government schools. And, as reported(http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264175006-en) by the OECD, progressive nations - Sweden, Finland, and the Netherlands - publicly fund over 95 per cent of independent schools' total costs. Such funding puts independent schools within reach of many more families.Funding all schools, not just government-run schools, closes the gap between rich and poor. In jurisdictions where independently managed schools receive greater proportions of public funding, the socioeconomic disparities between government and non-government schools disappear. In other words, where there is a greater quantity and variety of fully-taxpayer-funded, non-government-managed K-12 education options, there are narrower differences between advantaged and disadvantaged populations.Why should independent schools be reserved for the wealthy and connected? Isn't education about remedying natural disadvantages, so that everyone gets a fair shot at life?Beyond its effects on individual students, education is not merely a private matter. It has profound immediate and long-term effects on our society and economy - which is why schooling is taxpayer-funded and compulsory, even in free societies. And it is free societies that extend this funding to religious schools. We see this in the freest economies of East Asia, the democracies of Western and Northern Europe, and in our own history. Canada's founders deliberately enshrined educational freedom in our constitution to protect religious freedom.How so? Religion is only realized in a community of faith, where deeply held convictions and a rich cultural heritage are shared. Education helps pass all this down from generation to generation. Thus religious freedom very much requires educational freedom.In a free country, why should one set of taxpayers have to send their children to schools that oppose their deepest convictions and cultural heritage? This was the case made by Thomas D'Arcy McGee that in the 1860s led to section 93 of our Constitution Act. Back then, the issue was Protestantism versus Catholicism. Today it is a narrow view of secularism against pluralism.Matthew Lau: Cutting CBC would give twice(https://financialpost.com/opinion/matthew-lau-cutting-cbc-would-give-twice)Opinion: Tide may be turning towards greater economic freedom(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-tide-may-be-turning-towards-greater-economic-freedom)William Watson: Canada's economic plate-glass ceiling(https://financialpost.com/opinion/william-watson-canadas-economic-plate-glass-ceiling)Increasingly, secularism in Canada is no longer about state neutrality; it's a \"closed secularism\", where the state is expected to enforce a religion-free zone. Its root is cultural amnesia about faith.We have forgotten the tangible ways religious communities contribute to the common good. Those communities meet in synagogues, churches, mosques, or other places for worship. As my colleague Rev. Dr. Andrew Bennett has noted(https://www.cardus.ca/article/public-worship-leads-to-public-action/), their worship is not merely for themselves - a private function that happens behind closed doors. It is transformed into service offered to others.As those communities form in schools, there are spillover benefits. The largest non-government data set of graduate outcomes (the Cardus Education Survey(https://www.cardus.ca/research/education/reports/cardus-education-survey-2016-educating-to-love-your-neighbour/)) finds that religious schools overcontribute to the common good. Among all Ontario graduates, those from religious independent schools are the most likely to participate in almost every category of volunteering defined by Statistics Canada. They're also more trusting of strangers, co-workers and neighbours, and they're more likely to pay attention to the news.A comprehensive 2021 review(https://www.cardus.ca/research/education/reports/good-schools-good-citizens/) of the academic literature shows independent schools excel in helping students become good, engaged citizens. Religious independent schools excel at imparting and encouraging political knowledge, civic engagement, and respect for the civil liberties and opinions of others. \"On almost every measure, independent-school attendance enhances civic outcomes,\" says Dr. Ashley Berner, director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy. \"Thus, democratic policy-makers can have confidence that expanding access to independent schools while ensuring their quality is likely to enhance the civic capabilities of young people and lead, eventually, to a more civically integrated and politically engaged public.Why would we want to limit the number of students who can benefit from such an education? Most especially, when all society reaps the benefits? Rather than defund religious schools, it's time to allow funding to follow all students to their school of best fit - religious or non-religious.David Hunt is education director at the think-tank Cardus. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2022 Postmedia Network Inc.
