Brazil became a major provider of China’s raw materials – everything from iron ore to chicken – and the Lula administration invested the profits to expand social programmes. During his eight years in power, the Brazilian economy grew on average by4.5%, and around 40 million peoplemoved out of povertyto join a growing – though fragile – middle class.Twelve years later, Brazil is a different country. In the past eight years, Brazil’s GDP growth has averaged-0.1%5. Even before the 2020 Covid contraction of -3.9%, the South American giant’s economy had been bumping along at under 2% growth. China’s economy has – relatively – cooled off to a projected growth rate of4.3%% in 2022.  It cannot bail Brazil out again. And Bolsonaro’s last-minute efforts to secure his re-election throughcash giveawaysto the poorest families, along with hisCovid stimulus package, have left the Brazilian state with a fiscal overhang.According to the government’s own projections, the fiscal deficit is expected to hit$12.25bn (£10.8bn)in 2023, requiring future belt-tightening that will crimp Lula’s capacity to expand social programmes precisely at a time when poverty has increased.Bolsonaro’s term has also been marked by social regression. Nearly700,000 people have diedfrom Covid (the second highest number of deaths in the world), in no small part because the “Trump of the tropics”peddled false curesand refused to endorse basic practices such as the wearing of masks and social distancing. And according toOxfam, more than 33 million people in Brazil were going hungry in the six months up to April this year. At the same time, the president’s misogynist, racist andhomophobic rhetorichas sharpened social divisions and given freer license for discrimination and even violence.The political landscape is also more challenging. Brazil’s famously factionalised Congress will be more difficult to rein in due to a reform by Bolsonaro that devolved the executive’s discretionary spending – typically used to log roll votes – to the Congress, thus removing a key tool used by past presidents to build coalitions that could pass legislation.In contrast to the heady days of the early 2000s, when the charismatic Workers’ party leader rose to the presidential palace, Lula today is a tarnished politician. The$2bn Lava Jato (car wash) scandal, which revealed widespread public-private corruption, became a stain on the go-go days of the Lula economic boom, and the former president spenta year and a halfin jail for allegedly having accepted a beach apartment and renovations from the companies implicated in the scheme. While relatively minor compared to the broader scandal, the entire story hangs over the Lula legacy and his appeal. This helps explain the former president’s high disapproval ratings, which were a factor fuelling Bolsonaro’s rise as a supposed outsider politician who would clean up the country’s corrupt political class.Even in defeat, Bolsonarismo will remain a political force, one that will not limit its power to traditional political institutions and voting. Despite Bolsonaro’s many failings, he retains a strong popular hold on his base. This alliance of what has been termed bible (evangelicals), beef (farmers, many of whom have rolled back environmental protections and contributed to thedeforestation of the Amazon) and bullets (gun-toting Brazilians, who, as a result of looser regulations on gun ownership now total over 2 million) will likely remain loyal and mobilised. And his party’s successes in the senate and the chamber of deputies guarantee that the party will remain an obstinate opposition even within the state.It will be a tough turn in power this time around for Lula, should he win. And with three sons, Bolsonaro’s legacy and coalition is poised to remain a loud, legislatively implacable, popularly volatile and potentially violent opposition.Christopher Sabatini is a senior research fellow in the Latin America, US and the Americas programme at Chatham House"
