            "inputText": "Please send your letters toletters@independent.co.ukThe current discussion aroundracismand discrimination is welcome and we all need to take an active, honest part in it. For white people, like me, that has to start with looking at ourselves and those deeply buried cultural beliefs that condition much of our attitudes and lay waiting to pounce, whether it'sBoris Johnsonusing inappropriate terms such as \"piccaninnies\" with \"watermelon smiles\" or calling a character in a novel a racist slur. But it's not limited to our elite.How many of us, if cut up on the motorway by a boy racer in a flash car, would not consider the driver's colour, even if only for a nanosecond? We are never going to be tempted to shout at him \"white b*****d\" but could we honestly say there is absolutely no chance that if he were black his colour could not pop into our minds?We shouldn't be surprised by this, instead be aware and conscious of why this could be. I suggest that for at least 500 years we have been telling ourselves that we, the whiteBritish, are better than all other races and this has been used to justify slavery, imperialism and even Brexit - we've effectively brainwashed ourselves. The problem is deep within us and our culture and to eliminate it we have to accept that the problem is ours and that we all need to constantly work on it.A person's colour is only relevant when it's relevant, like looking for a lost child. On other occasions, should it come into our minds, we need to ask ourselves why? If it's not relevant then note this and re-educate ourselves.John SimpsonRoss on WyeRein in tech giantsYet another example of unregulated abuse on social media demonstrates clearly how the tech giants need to be called to heel. Perhaps it might help if their licences to operate in this country were conditional on everyone who wishes to comment on platforms such Facebook and Twitter being required to take out a modest annual subscription paid for from a British bank account. They would then be instantly traceable if they post something illegal.Five pounds a year, for example, isn't going to cause financial hardship, nor will it prevent anyone posting under a pseudonym, nor will it prevent users reading anything online, which gives the tech companies the clicks their business models require. But once prosecutions begin, because the Online Harms Bill working its way through parliament could require the media companies to give police details of law-breaking UK-based account holders, the trolls, abusers, bullies and hate-posters will think twice before hitting \"send\". And if it catches on here, it could spread globally.Patrick CosgroveBucknell, ShropshireClear to seeThe poignant repercussions of suffocating heat waves, droughts, famines, dearth of water resources, devastating floods and wildfires, rising sea levels, melting glaciers, food insecurity, drowning cities and vertiginous economic meltdown are clear for all to see. We have reached a sobering moment in history where the living will envy the dead.Governments, policymakers, civil society, businesses and NGOs can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, boost economic growth and international development, create employment opportunities by tapping on the potential reservoirs of renewable clean green energies like solar and wind power to defeat the scourge of the climate crisis and global warming.Dr Munjed Farid Al QutobLondonHorrifiedI'm not a football fan - I have doubts about the ethics of professionalism in sport generally. But I have recently been very impressed by the team spirit and general demeanour of Gareth Southgate and his youthful team. They seem to be a thoroughly decent bunch, and a glowing example to young people. So even I had to sympathise with their sorrow at the outcome of the penalties on Sunday. (Not that penalty kicking is a reasonable way to determine the result, as the element of luck is so great that you might as well toss a coin.)I was horrified by the criticism and racial hatred that was poured upon some of them after the match. Fortunately there has since been an encouraging amount of public protest against the racists.But now Priti Patel has been defended by a No 10 spokesperson against accusations of justifying racism by her failure to condemn those who booed footballers for taking the knee. It's not the first time that the PM has felt the need to defend the home secretary. Is there a pattern developing here? Can we hope that she will shortly be following Matt Hancock on the way out of the cabinet?Susan AlexanderFrampton Cotterell, South GloucestershireUnvaccinated conundrumHow on Earth am I supposed to stay clear of the unvaccinated as a clinically vulnerable person? \"Ladies and gentlemen on the bus, could I have your attention, please? Is there anyone present who has not yet had both vaccine doses?\"Of course, the answer is that I'm expected to avoid buses and shops. And family members. And anyone in my household who is not yet fully vaccinated. For the rest of eternity. Or until I die. Presumably fromCovid.Or is the plan to prevent the unvaccinated from mixing with the rest of the population?The problem is, that farce stops being funny the moment it turns to tragedy, and the clown when he turns into the villain.Ian HendersonNorwichNo justificationThe behaviour of some England fans in London on Sunday was absolutely appalling.What has almost saddened me more though, is hearing people making excuses for this kind of despicable conduct by saying things like, \"but these people have been locked in for 18 months\". As though that justifies bad behaviour.Nobody was truly locked in, and even if they endured shielding or living with restrictions over the last year and a half, that is no excuse for the kind of unacceptable behaviour we witnessed.Judi MartinAberdeenshireRead MoreAs a Black British actor, I've been stereotyped one too many times.
