            "inputText": "By Danielle KubesI never even knew I was supposed to hate white men before doing my master's degree at Ryerson's School of Journalism, in 2012. But I learned quickly that they were to be scorned and derided for ... well, I'm still not sure exactly what. Existing? Stealing all the good journalism jobs? Never mind that my class had exactly two white males, and 26 females.Identity politics, I see, have only become more entrenched in years since. In fact, they've become downright scary. Whereas when I was in school, students mostly grumbled about such things, today's aspiring journalists have decided to take their grievances, knit them up tightly in C-4 and throw them at everything in sight.And Ryerson, cowering from their outrage, acquiesces, doing the wrecking for them. The school's chair, Janice Neil, an excellent professor who taught me broadcast journalism, and associate chair Lisa Taylor both resigned this weekend just before a letter signed by more than 150 current and former students(https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1ILMu6mqfO0Kz7F6l6ctji0zDcuKs4nR-gl0aLtCRytw/mobilebasic)was published online Monday morning.The letter was written after a group of students was frustrated by faculty response to questions about fellow student Jonathan Bradley(https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/ryerson-student-journalist-claims-he-was-fired-from-campus-newspaper-over-his-catholic-views), a Catholic who says he was barred from writing for The Eyeopener student newspaper because of his beliefs. Specifically, because of views he had expressed on homosexuality in private social media messages.At an online semi-annual general meeting in February(https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1327160321003228) students repeatedly asked how the school was going to help them feel safe and if they were going to publicly condemn Bradley. Faculty repeatedly declined to comment, citing the fact that The Eyeopener was unaffiliated with the school and that Bradley had filed a complaint that is currently before the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario. Students were discouraged from commenting to avoid being named in any defamatory suit. Instead, faculty recommended waiting for due process, no matter how painful, or slow it may be.Reading this letter you would think these aspiring journalists attended an orphanage from the Jane Eyre era instead of a modern, urban university. They speak of trauma, a poisoned environment, how unsafe it is and how they have been silenced and belittled.Ryerson University in downtown Toronto is seen in a file photo from May 25, 2020.What, one wonders, must be going on behind closed doors to merit such accusations? Were they forced to run sprints in winter? Was there asbestos in the ceiling or lead in the pipes? Surely the professors must have at least screamed racial obscenities at them.The specifics are much less dramatic, and focus on two main issues: marginalization and mental health.To the former, a Muslim women felt that her teacher's eyes darted to her whenever speaking about terrorism or ISIL. A Black woman says she was never taught by another Black woman. (And nor was I taught by another Jewish woman; I just didn't realize I was supposed to be mad about it). When George FLoyd was murdered the school sent a lovely email to Black students asking if they were OK and offering support. But it was the same email to every Black student, not a personalized one.The irony is, of course, that in their strident attempts to dismantle systematic racism, the students ended up acting more like the oppressors they rail against. They tore down two women in hard-won positions of power. They demand that Ryerson hire teachers and administrators specifically on the basis of sexual orientation and race. They actively discriminate against fellow students with different religious beliefs.You see, only they get to decide what kind of diversity matters - and they've settled on colour, gender and sexual orientation. Diversity of thought and opinion need not apply.As for the mental-health claims, it mostly seems to be about the workload. They talk about being burnt out, being refused extensions and being turned away from extra help. Students said they were expected to report on \"stressful and potentially traumatic events\" (often the most entry-level journalism job is on the crime beat, so this experience actually seems quite helpful).If they can't handle the deadlines of a school project, how will they handle working overtime in a major news organization with increasingly limited resources? Your editor will pass you up for promotions if you miss deadlines, even if you were suffering from an emotional crisis. Those who can handle the pressure will be those that succeed.\"Providing a safe classroom environment - both online and off - should be the school's main concern, so that no student feels threatened or ignored,\" these students write. Wrong. Ryerson's main concern must be educating these students - teaching them the trade and preparing them for the job market.We need to be constantly raising the bar and increasing the standards, not lowering them to accommodate students who can't handle them. That's how we're going to serve the public best - with first-class journalists who, instead of performing endless navel-gazing, will dig deeper and deliver the best stories and the best investigations. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
