Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu, the director of the World Health Organization, said, \"I understand why some countries want to vaccinate their children and adolescents, but right now I urge them to reconsider and to instead donate vaccines to COVAX (the global vaccine repository).\"The rationale is simple: children face a lower risk of death from COVID-19 as compared to adults.
