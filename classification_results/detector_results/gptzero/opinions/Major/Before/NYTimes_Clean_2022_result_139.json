Because I ultimately chose acceptance, our last years unfolded with a newfound, intimate connection.Initially, I was in denial. Mom’s forgetting my name, my identity as her daughter, as a wife and mother of her grandchildren, was devastating. Then, gradually, I accepted.I’d hear her greet me with outstretched arms and a childlike gaze: “Oh it’s you! I know you — I’d recognize you anywhere.

As a child of two parents who both had or have versions of dementia, I very much love the metaphor of the parent living in a place called Dementia, a place where we revisit stories and faces and places again and again, as if they are fresh and new.But I differ with Ms. Finnamore when she says that those in nursing homes have a much shorter life expectancy than those who stay in their homes. I am not sure that has to be the case, although in a bad care facility it certainly is. With kind and competent support in a facility, the parent with dementia can be given the level of help that can overwhelm the family member. I am very grateful that my mother has this kind of care and support during her remaining time in the land of Dementia.Michael ZilberAlameda, Calif.To the Editor:My aunt died from dementia one year ago and I wished that we could have kept her home with us. She lived with us for six months and, yes, it was hard work taking care of her. But while Joan was with us, she responded well to stimulation, especially her beloved music. She had a wicked sense of humor and an entire fantasy life that she had created.We quickly learned that the kind and sensible way to go was to “get into her reality.” It’s not hard to do, and Dementia can be — and was for Joan — an interesting place. Once she moved into a nursing home she went straight downhill. She was kept clean and cared for, but the drugs dulled her mind and she lost interest in everything, even her music. So sad.Mary StimmelPine Harbor, Ga.To the Editor:Reading this essay I was reminded of the gifts of dementia that are offered, but oftentimes camouflaged and lost by the duties and responsibilities that caregivers are bogged down with. What a blessing to have the insight and attitude to see beyond the confusion, repetition, disorientation and care demands needed to support a person with dementia, and revel in who her mom, Bunny, was, rather than who she no longer is.Suzanne Finnamore’s travel log about her journey with Bunny reminds us to allow their history to define these individuals, and to be their legacies.Barbara VogelNew Hyde Park, N.Y.The writer is a social worker at Northwell Health and provides support for dementia patients and caregivers.‘We All Feel Helpless’ After Another ShootingTo the Editor:After reading theMay 17 letters about the Buffalo shooting, I came to the conclusion that they could have been written after any of the many shootings recently by angry, racist white men.I don’t mean to denigrate the writers’ frustration at these heinous, senseless acts. But we always seem to wind up in the same place. We all feel helpless after one of these events.Yes, something needs to be done about the proliferation of guns in our country, and yes, something needs to be done about the lack of mental health treatment, and yes, something needs to be done about racism. I could go on and on. But taking a macro view of our problems would lead you to one place: our dysfunctional government.We have a Democratic majority in Congress and a Democratic president duly elected by a majority vote, and yet nothing ever gets passed that would make our lives better because of the absence of bipartisanship. I am waiting (and will likely still be until I die) for a Republican to stand up to his or her party and do the right thing. Hand-wringing accomplishes nothing.Susan MasoneHuntington, N.Y.Advice for EvangelicalsTo the Editor:“A Pastor Struggles as Politics Divide a Congregation in Arkansas” (front page, May 10) was very depressing.Evangelicals are great evangelists — for atheism. The damage they have done to the Christian faith by embracing right-wing politics and lunatic conspiracy theories is perhaps irreparable.If they want respect from society then I suggest they start by living by the spirit and teachings of Jesus.(Rev.) Steven JonesLandisville, Pa.The writer is a retired Lutheran minister.PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Masha Krasnova-Shabaeva FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
