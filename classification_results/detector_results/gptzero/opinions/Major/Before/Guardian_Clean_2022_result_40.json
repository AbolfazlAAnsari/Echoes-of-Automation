A win for the Lib Dems next week would be a step towards rebuilding the party in the south-west, a stronghold that the Toriescapturedin 2015.Sleaze is also back in politics. In Wakefield, the former Tory MP was sent to prison for molesting a 15-year-old boy. Labour has to overturn a 3,000-odd majority. The Tories have been on the offensive this week. The immoral Rwandan deportation policy is an attempt, in part, to revive a Brexitdividing linewith Labour.CastingLabour as a party in the pay of striking railway unions is a more traditional electoral cleavage. Mr Johnson, however, has been noticeable by his absence – cancelling atripto Wakefield today andavoidingreporters in Devon last weekend.Even if Mr Johnson were to lose both seats, a progressive alliance on the centre-left would still be a long way off. Byelections are not a useful guide to a national contest. There are twobattlegroundsemerging in England: one between Labour and the Conservatives, another between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. Labour and the Lib Dems rarely, in target seats, square off against each other. But in general elections local parties are loth to stand aside. If this were possible then Labour could focus on winning back red wall seats and Lib Dems could target southern Tory voters.Pacts can work. During the 2019 general election the Brexit party stood down candidates in Tory-held seats, which academicssuggesthelped double Mr Johnson’s Commons majority. In everypostwar election, apart from2015, more voters supported progressive parties than conservative ones. Under Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system a vote split between Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP and the Greens has meant long periods of Tory hegemony. But were the SNP to be involved in a progressive alliance right now, the prospect of Scottish independence would be a gift to the Tories.If Labour and Lib Dems win next week, Britain might see a new era of non-aggression between them. That should be welcomed. But parties do not own their voters, who don’t like being taken for granted. The electorate knows how to vote tactically and understands pragmatic decisions about directing campaign resources. This is happening to some extent. Labourheavyweightshave flooded the Yorkshire constituency, while Sir Ed Davey hasconcentratedhis party’s energies on theDevonseat. Informal cooperation to win next week’s byelections is a necessary way to convince Tories that their interests – and Britain’s – lie in ousting Mr Johnson."
