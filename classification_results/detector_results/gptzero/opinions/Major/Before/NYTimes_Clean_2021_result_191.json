Many of us are fortunate to have everything we need and opportunities to buy much of what we want all year round.Holidays do not carry the meaning they did in preindustrial, poorer, more rural societies. We don’t look forward to the break from hard labor, or the change from basic food to rich feasts, because for most of us our lives are pretty good all year.Thus the gifts can be a burden as much as a joy, and certainly not an efficient allocation of resources. We would all be better off just exchanging greetings and giving to those less well off.Rebecca S. FahrlanderBellevue, Neb.The writer is a retired adjunct professor of psychology and sociology.To the Editor:Deriding gift giving as materialistic has long been the refuge of the thoughtless or untrained gift giver. But it also betrays a lack of cultural awareness of the meaning and value of gifts, particularly on big gift-giving occasions like Christmas.For many families, including my own, Christmas gifts are, in their own way, financial management; big items that we would not buy for ourselves are consigned to one special time a year. Knowing what others “want and need” is important in this context, but there are other contexts as well.Thinking of something for someone — as small as a special book, for example — or picking up something that reminds you of somebody is an act of love. Giving gifts to strangers — when visiting the family of a fiancé, for example — is a way of forging connection and extending gratitude.I hope the author’s journey in this direction will continue to grow.Nicole KnoblochArlington, Mass.Taxpayers and Religious SchoolsTo the Editor:Re “States Must Not Bar Religious School Options,” by Michael Bindas and Walter Womack (Opinion guest essay, Dec. 8):By arguing that Maine should take the unprecedented step of making tuition assistance available to parents sending their children to private religious schools, the writers are essentially seeking to have the state’s taxpayers pay for religious indoctrination.There’s no doubt that religious schools play an important role in American education. But our nation was founded on the bedrock principle of separation of church and state.Out of respect for freedom of religion, we allow religious schools to discriminate in whom they employ as teachers, to teach religious doctrines and to promote a religious worldview. But requiring taxpayers to fund those religious views and teachings — even those they find objectionable — is antithetical to our constitutional freedoms.As we stated in ouramicus briefat the Supreme Court, Maine’s tuition program is constitutional. Ruling against the state would be inconsistent with precedent and undermine the right of states to protect their taxpayers from coerced funding of distinctly religious activities. Simply put, this case should not be viewed as a case of discrimination against religion.Jonathan A.

But my parents, East Coast natives, and then a college roommate from New York, preferred their bagels toasted with butter. I finally tried it. So should everyone else. It was wonderful. You can actually taste the bagel!Joshua G. VincentChicagoTo the Editor:Is it heresy? I don’t know, but it’s delish! I spread mayonnaise on my bagel, not cream cheese, before adding lox, capers, fresh dill, a tomato slice and red onion. Try it. You’ll like it. You may never go back to that big glob of butterfat!Peter FeibelmanAlbuquerqueTo the Editor:I call on President Biden to release the Strategic Cream Cheese Reserve!Ron FreedmanTorontoA Chassis Maker’s ViewTo the Editor:Re “End the Destructive Trump-Biden Tariffs,” by Binyamin Appelbaum (Opinion, Nov. 25):The International Trade Commissionfoundthat U.S. producers were “materially injured” by subsidized Chinese chassis. The I.T.C. duties gave domestic chassis manufacturers and their competitors in Canada, Mexico and elsewhere the ability to compete at fairly traded prices.More than a thousandAmericansmake chassistoday because of the commission’s decision. Yes, some of these jobs start at $18 an hour, as you report, but many pay far more, with medical benefits, 401(k)s and other incentives. We are proud to be part of the effort to save American jobs and restore equity to this industry.Domestic chassis manufacturers believe in free trade, but free trade must also reflect fair trade. We welcome fairly traded foreign competition, but we believe that the United States is well advised to defend its businesses that suffer from unfair Chinese trade practices.Frank KatzSeattleThe writer is the chairman of Cheetah Chassis.PHOTO:    (PHOTOGRAPH BY Eleanor Davis FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"
