Here are some things left out of the announcement that parents should know.1. The research was inconclusiveThestudieswere too small to achieve statistical significance when evaluating efficacy against mild or severe COVID-19 infection. As a result, the FDA allowed both companies to extrapolate effectiveness by measuring antibody levels, pointing to data from older children and adults.PARENTS NOW TO DECIDE IF THEY WILL GET THEIR CHILDREN VACCINATED AGAINST COVID-19There wereno casesof severeCOVID illnessin either the vaccine or placebo group. The Moderna vaccine had 4,774 children and the Pfizer vaccine had 4,526 (including those who received the placebo).Pfizer concluded that their vaccine was 80% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, but based it on 3 cases in the vaccine group and 7 cases in the placebo group in a subset of children who received a third dose.Even this was not statistically significant. In fact, it had a confidence statistic so wide, you could drive an aircraft carrier through it. (They reported the largest confidence interval I have ever seen in my 20-year research career). At one end of the range of possibilities indicated by the confidence interval, the vaccine could be associated witha 370%increasedriskof getting COVID-19. The Moderna trial reported a short-term efficacy of 38% in preventing symptomatic illness–an effect well-known to be transient.FLORIDA GOV. RON DESANTIS SAYS WHITE HOUSE LYING ABOUT COVID VACCINE POLICYIronically, there weremoreoverall hospitalizations (unspecified) in the vaccine group.

Sign located near the 1700 block of Clifton Road in Atlanta, Georgia, on the Emory University campus. Vertical composition. (iStock)(iStock)The CDC even said inits own slidesat their deliberation meeting that data assessing efficacy were poor, characterizing them as \"very low certainty\" and noting that there are \"very serious concerns for imprecision due to study size\". They also noted the very short follow-up time of 1.3 months.2. The FDA lowered their standards for acceptable vaccine efficacy needed to approveIn 2020, the FDA and public health officials said they would authorize a COVID vaccine that showed at least a 50% efficacy. But weeks before the vaccines were authorized for babies and toddlers, the FDA’s Dr. Peter Marks lowered the pre-set bar,sayingon May 6, \"If these vaccines seem to be mirroring efficacy in adults and just seem to be less effective against Omicron like they are for adults, we will probably still authorize.\"There is absolutely zero clinical evidence to support vaccinating healthy children who already had COVID. Natural immunity, inexplicably ignored by public health officials, confers strong protection against severe disease.3. Most children have natural immunityThe CDC reportedreportedthat, as of February 2022, 75% of children 0-17 years-old already had COVID-19. Given how rampant the Omicron strain has circulated since then, upwards of 80-90% of children have likely had COVID-19. There is absolutely zero clinical evidence to support vaccinating healthy children who already had COVID.Natural immunity, inexplicably ignored by public health officials, confersstrong protectionagainst severe disease.4. Safety was based on a small sampleThe small size of the studies in children under 5 makes it nearly impossible to observe rates of rare complications such as myocarditis, whichoccursin 1 in 2,650 12-17 year-old boys after the 2nd dose. This complication has been associated with EKG changes in children and evenconcerning MRI findingsmonths after recovering from myocarditis.The New England Journal of Medicinereportedone case of vaccine-associated myocarditis death in a 22-year-old in an Israeli population study. Keep in mind that babies can’t tell you when they have myocarditis.JEAN-PIERRE FLOUNDERS QUESTIONS ON BIDEN'S LAST COVID TESTEach of the Moderna and Pfizer COVID studies in children under 5 reported one serious adverse event after receiving the vaccine. Less serious adverse events (pain, swelling, local reactions) were similar across the vaccine and placebo groups (7.7% vs 4.1% for Moderna; 1% vs 1.5% for Pfizer). These data do suggest a good safety profile, likely due to the low dose given. However, time will tell.As Dr. Eric Rubin, the editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, said in October 2021, \"But we’re never going to learn about how safe this vaccine is unless we start giving it. That’s just the way it goes.\"Establishing safety takes time. The infant rotavirus vaccine, Rotashield, was first thought to be safe. In the original trial, the adverse event (an intestinal malfunction requiring surgery) had been noted in5 of 10,054vaccine recipients, but the side effect was not deemed statistically significant. Ultimately, that vaccine was pulled from the market after many more complications were observed. Similarly, J&J’s vaccine was bannered to be safe until the FDA said otherwise.By comparison, the polio vaccine wastested in 1.8 million childrenover a year before it was broadly recommended.5. Healthy children have a very low risk of a serious consequence from COVID-19Healthy children have a radically different risk profile and a different need for vaccination compared to children with comorbid conditions.  A German population study found that all deaths in children 5-17 were in children with a comorbidity.  That is, no healthy child 5-17 died in that country unvaccinated.Though MIS-C is rare, doctors say parents should monitor their children for associated symptoms. (iStock)Alasdair Munroanalyzed UK dataand determined that 75% of deaths of children from COVID in the UK occurred in the 8% of children who have other serious health issues. That’s why the risk-benefit ratio is radically different for a child with comorbidity than a healthy child.The CDC’s risk analysis lumps all children together. It also makes the mistake of counting hospitalizations and death where COVID was an incidental finding.
