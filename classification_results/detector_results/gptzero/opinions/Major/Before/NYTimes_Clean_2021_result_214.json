            "inputText": "The world needs an outpouring of generosity.This article is part of Times Opinion’s Holiday Giving Guide 2021. For other ideas on where to donate this year, please seethe rest of our guide here.I confess that to me, Christmas shopping can feel mostly like another chore in a busy December. But I love to give gifts that make the world a better place. Years ago, I took up a practice of donating to worthy organizations in people’s names as a small addition to their material gift. Though I don’t do it every year, I really enjoy this kind of gift giving.This year in particular, as the planet continues to be convulsed by the pandemic, the world needs an outpouring of generosity. New York Times Opinion invited its writers to celebrate nonprofits, NGOs or philanthropic efforts that they appreciate. This can help provide some direction and let you know about organizations that need support.For most of my 20s, I worked with nonprofits among those who suffer from addiction, poverty or homelessness. What I learned from that time now subtly informs the organizations to which I give time or money. I saw that more than material things or even programs, people need community. Those who are in deep need don’t need handouts. They (like all of us) require holistic support, even love, that addresses physical, spiritual, mental and social needs. I am drawn to organizations that offer this kind of care.I also look for organizations that focus on those in extreme crisis or poverty, often in hard-to-reach places where typical government support is inadequate. In these places, local churches or other religious groups are often key. I lived briefly in a village in East Africa where the only local infrastructure was an outdoor market, a church and a missionary-run school.Even here in the United States, religious organizations of all sorts are often the first line of care in many communities. It’s important that these organizations offer help to all who need it, not just those who share their religious beliefs. But faith often motivates the most holistic kind of social action. As a feminist I also find that I’m excited by organizations that lift up women, children and families because I’ve witnessed the kind of generational impact these organizations can have.Here are the causes I’m donating to this year:Women empowered around the globe.Five Talentsis an organization that partners with local churches in regions of extreme poverty (currently Bolivia, Myanmar and six countries in sub-Saharan Africa). They create savings groups, led by trained and equipped people from the community, that provide tiny loans to help recipients build better lives. But the organization doesn’t stop at loans. It also provides training in adult literacy and business development and offers trauma counseling and recovery.“We found if people cannot read and write, their business is bound to fail,” said Elizabeth Ha, director of strategic partnerships for Five Talents.This comprehensive support contributes to a high success rate (95 percent of loans are repaid, according to Five Talents). Ms. Ha shared with me one story of a woman in Burundi who became a single mom to six kids when her husband unexpectedly disappeared. She joined a Five Talents savings group and began with a microloan of $1.26. She started to make and save money from selling vegetables. Eventually, she bought two goats, which multiplied and soon became six goats.She then began giving back to her community, donating goats to others in need. She continued to grow her business and eventually took another loan to purchase a cow. Her cows multiplied and enabled her to buy land. Her story is marked by joy and this joy is overflowing generationally. Her son just began a doughnut business.Eighty percent of the people Five Talents works with are women. Ms. Ha tells me that “we intended to work in the most fragile regions and among the most vulnerable people. That naturally emerged as women.” When these women are lifted out of poverty, their families benefit, often opening opportunities for their kids to receive education.Ms. Ha tells me that the message participants receive is, “As you rise, blessing overflows and helps others rise.”The people who enter Five Talents programs need a boost, but the work they do — and the sense of dignity that comes from it — is all their own. They make the effort of learning to read and write, to save money, and to start and run a business. They reap the rewards for themselves and those around them. That’s the difference, Ms. Ha says, “between dependency and empowerment.”Twenty dollars provides a literacy, numeracy or business skills training session for one village; $100 sponsors a savings group; $500 pays for equipment and travel costs to reach remote communities.Refugees resettled and cared for.World Reliefdescribes itself as a “global Christian humanitarian organization that brings sustainable solutions to the world’s greatest problems — disasters, extreme poverty, violence, oppression, and mass displacement.” I became familiar with the group because of its work with immigrants and refugees.About three-quarters of the refugees that World Relief is working with this year are from Afghanistan, according to Matthew Soerens, the organization’s U.S. director of church mobilization and advocacy. World Relief says it has served 1,500 people evacuated from Afghanistan since August.Afghans fleeing the Taliban are often people who risked their lives to aid America or are ethnic or religious minorities, female community leaders or L.G.B.T. people who are in extreme danger under the Taliban. Mr. Soerens told me about an Afghan family of four whom World Relief recently resettled. When Kabul fell, this family was in danger because the father had worked with the U.S. Embassy. They were evacuated by U.S. forces, and after over a month of processing and waiting, they boarded a plane and landed in Memphis.World Relief Memphis rallied to provide welcome and vital services to this family and to connect them to a community. Because of an apartment shortage, a local pastor connected with World Relief hosted the family in his home until they could find housing.World Relief also does the hard work of political advocacy for refugees and immigrants, supporting policies that protect the weakest and most vulnerable around the world.People “fleeing pure evil,” said Myal Greene, the president and C.E.O. of World Relief, “can be welcomed into a city of love.”“We take people who’ve experienced the worst day of their life,” he said, “and we give them hope.”Fifty-five dollars provides child nutrition information to a mother’s group overseas; $100 gives a refugee child a backpack and school supplies; $800 helps a refugee family get their green cards.Survivors of exploitation and trafficking healed.Red Oak Hopeworks with survivors of sexual trafficking and exploitation where I live, in Austin, Texas, and also in Uganda and countries in Asia. Here in Austin, it runs a transitional home where survivors of exploitation receive rent-free housing, relational support, case management, advocacy, medical care, counseling, vocational training and addiction recovery support. Women stay at the house anywhere from one to 18 months. Some get their G.E.D. One woman who was part of their program recently received her master’s degree. Children are also permitted to stay in the house with their mothers, providing safety and hope for both generations.Around40 million peopleare trapped in human trafficking worldwide. It is nearly impossible to get good data on how common this is in the United States because trafficking and exploitation are hidden crimes, butthe Polaris Project estimates over 20,000 peoplewere trafficked here in 2019. Red Oak Hope offers help and support to individual women, one by one.Women who come to Red Oak Hope’s transitional home are often, beginning in childhood, trapped in a long “cycle of abuse and trauma and addiction” that shapes a woman over time, said Haley Patterson, the organization’s director of U.S. programs.Because these patterns of repeated abuse and trauma occur in relationships, Ms. Patterson told me, “all we do is through the lens of relationship and building relationship,” seeking the slow restoration that can only come with a safe place to heal.“Any night, any day, any hour that a woman is safe and her body is safe from exploitation is a victory,” Ms. Patterson said.Red Oak Hope offers practical help such as educational and vocational training programs, but the key focus of its work is walking closely with women day in and day out, helping them set goals and take small steps toward them. It seeks a low staff-to-survivor ratio so that it can provide a high level of support to each woman it works with.I asked Ms. Patterson what inspires her work. She told me, “God calls us into the work of walking with the oppressed.” She added, “There is a lot of beauty lived” among those who’ve suffered deeply.Twenty-five dollars provides two and a half hours of economic empowerment classes for survivors; $50 provides one week of groceries for a survivor; $100 provides one hour of counseling; $500 provides one month of shelter for a survivor in crisis.The world is often a dark, scary place, but your generosity can provide light and hope.
