It is a curious tactic since that is not necessary for defamation. She was clearly referring to Depp as shown by the tsunami of criticism that followed.What is likely to be more damaging for Depp is the self-inflicted damage to his career. Depp's drinking and bizarre behavior made him notorious in the media.Depp did make a convincing case that his career was effectively ended when Heard first claimed abuse.Disney (which owns the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\"series) had already decided that he would not continue in his most famous role before Heard's column ever ran. Moreover, she previously accused him of abuse years earlier in seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO).Yet, Depp did make a convincing case that his career was effectively ended when Heard first claimed abuse.There is no appellate process in the court of public opinion. Moreover, by making the allegation in a court filing, Heard could not be sued for defamation due to immunity rules. She would have to repeat such claims outside of court to lay the foundation for a lawsuit. That did not come until years later with the Washington Post column. By that time, Depp's career was as sunk as Davy Jones' locker.The fact is that it would have been better if this trial were held two years ago when Heard first made the allegations. He is right that, when he was asked on the stand what the allegation cost him and he responded, \"nothing less than everything.\"In the end, both Depp and Heard seem more intent on mutually assured destruction than actual verdicts in their favor.The one thing that is already established is perhaps the best single line from the movie \"So I Married an Axe Murderer:\" \"We both said, 'I do!' and we haven't agreed on a single thing since.\"CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JONATHAN TURLEYJonathan Turley is a Fox News Media contributor and the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University. He is the author of \"The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage\" (Simon & Schuster, June 18, 2024)."
