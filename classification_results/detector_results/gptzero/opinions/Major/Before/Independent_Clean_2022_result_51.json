It is high time it should come to terms with this fact if it wants to get into power again.William FrancisLondonJohn Rentoul wrongly asserts that the formation of the 2010 Tory/LibDem coalition shows that the LibDems would not join a progressive coalition in the future.While he admits that the parliamentary arithmetic in 2010 made a Labour/LibDem coalition difficult, he ignores the inconvenient fact that a slew of Labour big beasts (including David Blunkett and Charles Clarke) took to the airways saying that they would withhold their support from any such coalition, so the potential Labour/LibDem coalition moved from difficult to impossible.Philip GoldenbergWokingA well-planned stitch upSo Boris Johnson and his very expensive legal adviser can see the evidence thatSue Grayhas lined up against him before he responds to the Metropolitan Police questionnaire?Did Mr or Ms Joe Bloggs have the same chance when they came up against their alleged infringements of lockdown laws?No wonder Boris Johnson is looking so confident. It seems like a well-planned stitch up. So much for the impartiality of the report.Gordon RonaldHertfordshireEnd of mandatory self-isolationSoon we will not need to isolate if we test positive for Covid. When we don't have serious symptoms or we attribute what we feel to a common cold or are asymptomatic, we can go to work and out to play. Especially if we will not be paid for precautionary isolation, then we will mix with the innocent.There will be much more infection and the vulnerable will continue to fall ill, potentially developing long Covid. The government once again hopes that the debatable concept of herd immunity will solve our future health problems. It is a dangerous experiment conducted on a human population, not fruit flies in a laboratory. A political decision, not a scientific one.Robert MurrayNottinghamGrand gestures to distract from the PM's limitationsThe inability of the British prime minister to think strategically and plan ahead has been clear for some time: in his failure to \"get Brexit done\"; his poor decision making throughout the pandemic; his incapacity to protect the most vulnerable from a cost-of-living crisis; and his willingness to U-turn whenever he is backed into a corner.His approach is always to make bold, sweeping statements, secure a high-vis photo opportunity, throw other people's money at a problem and then move \"onwards\" to the next crisis.Events in Ukraine have provided the \"greased piglet\" with another opportunity to make grand gestures in order to distract us from his limitations once again. Having accepted generous donations from Russia's money-laundering oligarchs, he elbows his way onto centre stage in Munich in order to make high-sounding statements of that which is obvious to anyone who cares to spend a few moments thinking about the current situation.International leaders, including Johnson, might have avoided current circumstances if they had taken Putin seriously in recent years and sought to understand and manage him rather than demonising and ignoring him. The crisis in Ukraine requires politicians to understand the complexity of the situation, the historical context of current events and, most important of all, the need to generate a plan that will enable those engaged in the crisis to achieve a dignified and diplomatic resolution.As ever, Johnson has no plan beyond that which is expedient in the short term.Graham PowellCirencesterTo keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter byclicking hereDon't expect cafes to do your parenting for youAnita Slater's articledoesn't fully explain why the cafe manager was ejecting a family because he felt their child was a health and safety risk. Could it be that he or she was left to run wild or to crawl on the floor while staff were trying to serve hot drinks to other customers?Maybe the cafe is just anti-babies and children, as some customers can be too, but I'd hazard a guess that they are more likely to be anti-parents who do not control their children.Anita says her area is largely white and middle class. Might I also suggest the word entitled? My children and grandchildren have been taken to pubs and cafes from the moment they were born and have received unsolicited praise for their behaviour because we set clear parameters. They understood that if they were going to share an adult space they had to rise to the occasion. Isn't that the essence of community? That we learn to care about and respect each other?Yes,parentinghas always been stressful and exhausting, but once you have children you can't expect cafes and the people who work in them to do your parenting for you, while you enjoy a little \"me time\".Jane MogfordCirencester"
