Evangelical ideologues, far-right actors and radical-right billionaires have organised to undermine women's right to safe, legal abortions through a combination of violence againstclinicsanddoctors, dark money and political influence.So, how did the US get here?After years of legal assaults thatrestricted abortion accessand targeted clinics in Republican states; years of disinformation spread by \"crisis pregnancy centres\", where women are persuaded to not have abortions; and years of burdensome demands on women to endure ultrasounds, gain parental consent and put up with counselling in order to have a termination, Trump's election opened the door for abortion rights to end in the US.Ultimately, it required courts, not politicians, to end abortion. That's where theFederalist Societycomes in. Headed by Leonard Leo, the legal organisation supported anti-abortion lawmakers across the US into positions of influence where they could draft laws to ban abortion after 15 weeks ... 12 weeks ... six weeks ... and completely. The end goal was for anti-abortion states to try to implement one of these laws, where it would be challenged again and again until it reached the supreme court.To do that, the anti-abortion movement needed supreme court justices who would enact its agenda. They got their way with the help of the leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, who blocked President Obama from nominating a supreme court judge, leaving the field open for Trump to promote the anti-abortion Neil Gorsuch. After that came two more Trump-appointed justices: Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.That was the judicial assault on abortion rights. But that assault could only happen with the help of money ... and lots of it. Luckily for the anti-abortion movement, there are plenty of wealthy foundations keen to fund the cause.
