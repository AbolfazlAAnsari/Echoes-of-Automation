The Tories represent the slave masters and are as out of date as the RMT’s policies and strategy.Michael MannShrewsburyEnormous damage doneHistory has many lessons to teach us. Unfortunately, we fail to learn most of them. But we must not ignore what recent history is shrieking at us, and that is that our system permits enormous damage to be done in a short time by one person.In just a few years,Boris Johnsonhas reduced our successful, respectable nation to an impoverished, untrustworthy laughing stock. He has divorced us from our nearest trading neighbours, broken his own government’s rules, and made international agreements that he either misunderstood or had never intended to keep. And he’s trying to remove ourright to peaceful protest.As Caolan Magee says, Johnson has the makings of a tyrant.  But our first past the post voting system has allowed him a large parliamentary majority, so we are stuck with him for another two years, unless more Tory MPs turn against him. Can nothing be done?Susan AlexanderSouth GloucestershireTo keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter byclicking hereThere is a magic money treeWe have often been told, by successive members of this Conservative government, that there is no “magic money tree” which can be used to finance public sector wages or public services.Nonetheless, consider the recent story thatBoris Johnson allegedly intended to make Carrie Symonds his chief of staffon a six-figure salary when he was foreign secretary. Never before has the highest office in the land been held by someone who treats this nation and its population with such blatant disregard, bordering on naked contempt.As thecost of living crisisbites ever harder and yet we are urged by his government, time and again, to show restraint in our wage demands, is it any surprise that underpaid and undervalued workers in the public sector are no longer willing to sit quietly and take whatever they are given? No administration with him at the helm, or holding any position of authority, can now expect any public respect or support.Julian SelfWolvertonThis article was amended on 11 August 2022.
