From as far back as I can remember, I've been taught and encouraged to recycle, pick up trash and conserve water. From the Earth Day parades in elementary school, to the \"reuse, reduce, recycle\" trends of recent years, I've always been a big proponent of protecting the planet. But it didn't really hit home until more recently.I lived in a city for most of my life and, for many years, I felt largely immune to climate change. While I knew it was happening, I was protected from the immediate impacts. I'd turn on the TV and see climate disasters happening all over the world, and yet my daily life was largely uninterrupted.That changed pretty soon after I moved to the mountains and had to evacuate from theLake Christine Fire. While the fire was started by incendiary ammunition, my town, like much of the state, was experiencingsevere droughtconditionsthat propelled the fire across 12,000 acres with dried grass, brush and trees as kindling.As a community, we rallied. We supported the firefighters and first responders day in and day out, from making sandwiches to providing housing and everything in between. I'd only lived in the Roaring Fork Valley for a year but felt deeply connected to my community in a way that was surprising. Tragedy will create bonds, regardless of background, ethnicity or political affiliation. The question is how much more we can take before we speak up, take action and demand more from our elected officials.And it's not just me, or my small town in Colorado. Extreme weather events are becoming more commonplace in every corner of the globe. This summer, an intense heat wave in Europeset record high temperatures, and fires broke out in the UK, France, Spain, Italy and Greece. Ice shelves in Antarctica arecrumbling faster than they can be replaced, and losses aredouble what was initially estimatedby scientists in 1997.Hurricane Fiona ravaged Puerto Rico before it madelandfall in Canadaas a severe tropical storm. Historic floods in Pakistanaffected 33 million peopleand left a third of the country underwater. Closer to home, theMarshall Fire in Boulderwas the most destructive in Colorado history in terms of structures lost.And these are just some events from this past year.Moving to a small town has opened my eyes to the dramatic effects of a changing world. And there are lasting reminders -- more than four years later, the burn scar from the Lake Christine Fire is still visible on the landscape whenever I drive down Highway 82.Climate change has an economic impact as well. In the 2017-2018 season, snow totals were so low that our mountains couldn't fully open all of the ski runs, and many employees who worked in hospitality were forced to take a two week \"mandatory vacation.\"Climate change has become an undeniable fact of life in this area, and our safety, livelihoods and wellbeing are at stake.Unfortunately, if we continue the way we're headed ... it's just the beginning.Opinion by Katherine KeelTM & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
