All of this can help boost the much-needed vitamins, minerals and hormones your body needs to focus on feeling less lonely.Be kind to others:Doing things for others can increase serotonin levels, the hormone responsible for feelings of satisfaction and happiness. Also, like exercise, helping others also releases endorphins, which can reduce stress and improve sleep. So, consider volunteering, buying someone lunch or donating to a worthy cause. Not only are you helping others, but you are also helping yourself.Engage in person with people:Interacting with people face-to-face can improve our mood and reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. Activities that involve other people, like going to church, sports activities and other community gatherings can increase a sense of belonging with positive effects on our mental health.Refocus online presence:Rather than passively browsing social media, do something that involves active (healthy) participation with other people. Trolling and criticizing others does not count. What I am talking about is playing online games, like chess, with another person. Consider joining a forum or comment on content you have an interest in. The more you interact with others while online, the more connected you can feel.Spend wisely:Instead of spending money online shopping for the latest clothes, digital accessory or what-not, refocus your money to savings and experiences. Buying the latest trend has short-lived excitement but placing money in savings and using it for an experience can have a lasting impact. Experiences can be as small as attending a museum, going to the theater or as big as skydiving, travel. The sky truly is the limit. Spending money on experiences is much better for our mental health and who knows, you may make a friend while doing it.Humans are social beings, and the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our natural tendencies. The long-term consequences on our health will be extreme. Before it’s too late, refocus and engage in quality social relationships to improve your chances of living a longer, healthier life.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.
