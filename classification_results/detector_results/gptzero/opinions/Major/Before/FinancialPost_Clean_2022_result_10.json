            "inputText": "By Avi Abraham Benlolo and Jerry S. GrafsteinOn June 1, 2001, a Palestinian terrorist blew himself up outside a Tel Aviv night club, killing 21 Israelis, 16 of whom were teenagers. Two months later, another Palestinian suicide terrorist entered the Sbarro restaurant in Jerusalem and killed 15 Israelis, including seven children and a pregnant woman and wounded 130 others. In March of 2002, during a Passover Seder in a hotel in Netanya, a Palestinian suicide bomber murdered 30 civilians and injured 140 others in one of the deadliest massacres.In response to the more than 1,378 civilians murdered by Palestinians terrorists from Gaza and the West Bank since September 2000, Israel had little choice but to build a security barrier to protect its citizens from continued mass murder. As a result, suicide-terrorism stopped almost immediately and while terror incidents still occur, they are now less co-ordinated by the Islamist groups that try to infiltrate the Jewish nation daily. The security barrier is not an \"apartheid wall.\" It is there to save lives and bring about peace. Good fences sometimes do make good neighbours.Thus, this week's shameful release of a new report by Amnesty International(https://www.politico.eu/article/jewish-organizations-amnesty-international-uk-apartheid-israel-palestina/#:~:text=The%20more%20than%20200%2Dpage,within%20Israel%20and%20Palestinian%20territories. ) accusing Israel of \"apartheid\" in its treatment of Palestinians is devoid of this context. Unlike any other nation on Earth, Israel faces unrelenting violent threats from the various terror organizations that are relentlessly engaged in undermining the Jewish state. Just this past May for instance, Hamas started an unprovoked war with Israel and launched 4,600 rockets at its civilian population. When Israel's next-door neighbour, Bashar al-Assad in Syria was threatened by a civil uprising, he brutally murdered hundreds of thousands(https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210601-decade-of-syria-war-killed-nearly-500-000-people-new-tally) of his own citizens - and continues to do so. Where was Amnesty International?Israel's detractors never seem to worry about the safety and security of Jewish lives in Israel. They never run to Israel's defence when Israel is attacked. They never issue scathing reports, initiate global campaigns or call on the International Criminal Court to take action against the incitement of hate and war crimes targeting Israeli civilians. Instead, they are quick to come down on the \"Jews,\" especially if they are trying to protect themselves.But we say, \"Never again.\" When the Jewish people were herded from their homes, into ghettos and then to concentration camps where they were gassed, the world stood by and did nothing against this vile antisemitic act. So, Amnesty, your report means nothing to us. As Jewish people, we will fight back to protect our families this time. At the same time, we will always and relentlessly stand at the forefront of human rights advocacy, promoting freedom and peaceful co-existence.Clearly, it makes little difference to so-called human rights advocates that Israel is a free and democratic country. It's incomprehensible to understand that a report is issued calling Israel an apartheid state while for the first time in history, an Arab political party is part of the governing coalition of the country. Israel's citizens also represent every ethnic and religious group under the sun. It's also irrational to believe that Israel is intentionally ethnically cleansing the Palestinian population given the fact this community has increased from approximately 500,000 in 1948 to nearly six million in 2021 in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The numbers speak for themselves and completely disqualify Amnesty's underlying premise.Avi Benlolo: Social media is dumbing down kids about the Holocaust(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/avi-benlolo-social-media-is-dumbing-down-the-holocaust)Avi Benlolo: Don't pretend the Texas synagogue attack was anything but an act of terrorism(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/avi-benlolo-dont-pretend-the-texas-synagogue-attack-was-anything-but-an-act-of-terrorism)Israel's tormentors have been planning this assault since the United Nations' infamous Durban conference in 2001. The stage was set to falsely equate Israel with the former South African apartheid regime, in an attempt to delegitimize, demonize and disrupt the very existence of the Jewish State. The Amnesty report regurgitates this established campaign and is calling for \"Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to their homes where they or their families once lived,\" which it's known would spell a demographic end to the Jewish State. Israel could not possibly absorb millions of Palestinian refugees who have been purposely held up in refugee camps without losing its Jewish character. Everyone knows this.We are pleased to note that most of Israel's allies, including the U.S. and Germany, have denounced the Amnesty report. We have called out Canadian leaders including our own prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to follow suit. As we wrote to the prime minister and the former leader of the official opposition this week, no other country is similarly harassed by the international community. Because Israel is the very embodiment of the Jewish people, the biased double standard practiced through these unrelenting attacks can only be understood as antisemitism. In fact, given the growth of violent antisemitism around the world, the Amnesty report is blatantly irresponsible and will trigger ever increasing antisemitic attacks, which are already at an all-time high around the world.National PostAvi Abraham Benlolo is the founder and chairman of The Abraham Global Peace Initiative(https://agpi.ca/ ).
