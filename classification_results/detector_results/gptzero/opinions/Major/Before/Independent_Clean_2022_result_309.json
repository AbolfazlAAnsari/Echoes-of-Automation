The poppy collectors are the natural successors of the military beggars consequent on the wars of Marlborough, Wellington and Kitchener.Yes, there is support provided by the government, but if it was adequate there would be no need for the support services of the Royal British Legion. The government’s contract with service people is broken; we should just pay more in tax to prevent service people and their families, saving them from having to rely on charity.I will wear a poppy to remember, but with shame at what the necessary fundraising represents: a failure to move on from making ex-service people beg in the streets. We should face up to the full economic cost of the consequences of war.Denis WickingAddress SuppliedTo keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter byclicking hereShame on usRecent key UN reports are adding to the body of evidence thatwe are not doing near enoughto limit global warming to 1.5C. Worse, we are heading towards a catastrophic increase of 2C or more. We chose this; therefore we deserve what we get.Unfortunately, it will be our children who get what we deserve. Shame on us!Ian HendersonNorwichStarmer needs to remember his baseIn contrast to many recent leaders of the Conservative Party, Keir Starmer is a pragmatist who thinks ahead and guards against precipitate action. He has a plan and is anxious not to derail the achievement of his end goal: to make Labour the party of government, not opposition.Although in principle he may support radical action in response to climate change, vulnerable migrants, workers’ rights, minority groups and Brexit, he seems to fear that the party will be caricatured and marginalised if it is seen to support action that alienates certain voters. It can be fairly said that he is being far too cautious and careful.He is in danger of losing the support of those who share his core beliefs in fairness, justice and greater equality by exclusively courting the electorate’s middle ground.Sunak’s half-hearted response to climate change – and the inexcusable appointment of Braverman as home secretary –provide Starmer with opportunitiesto state the case for radical policies that will have majority appeal. Among many other things, as Jeremy Corbyn implies, now is the time to speak out for more compassionate immigration policies and the maintenance of our democratic right to protest.Starmer needs to change gear and appeal to the core values of our people, presenting a clear vision of an alternative to the continuing chaos and self-serving short-sightedness of a Conservative government that is long past its sell-by date.Graham PowellCirencester"
