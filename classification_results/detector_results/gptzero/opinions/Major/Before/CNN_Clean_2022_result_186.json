            "inputText": "Tuesday's Georgia Republican gubernatorial primary between incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp and former US Senator and ardent Donald Trump supporter David Perdue was touted nationwide as an epic showdown between the former president and any Republican officeholder who dared to defy him after his defeat in the 2020 election.Kemp prevailedagainst Perdue Tuesday night in a major blow to the former president.After Kemp's refusal to help block President Joe Biden's victory in Georgia in 2020, Trump condemned the governor andcalled on him to resignfor his disloyalty, then repeatedly accused himof being a RINO-- \"Republican in name only.\" Trump also saidhe was ashamed to have endorsed Kempin 2018 andeven assertedthat Democrat Stacey Abrams \"might be better\" than Kemp as governor.Trump handpicked Perdue, his close political ally, to challenge Kemp, and then held rallies and fundraisers to support him. Trump and his aligned outside groups havepoured millions of dollarsinto Georgia with one group flatly proclaimingin a video posted on Twitter, \"You can't say you support Trump if you vote for Brian Kemp.\"Despite this unprecedented effort by the former president and his allies against a sitting office holder from his own party, Kemp rolled to aclear victoryTuesday and now turns his attention to the fall election in a repeat contest against Abrams, whom henarrowly defeatedin 2018.How did this happen? Kemp's primary win demonstrates that while the US (and Georgia) may not have returned to politics as usual, two critical rules of politics still apply.The first rule, as oftencredited to former House Speaker Tip O'Neill, is that \"All politics is local.\" At the end of the day, except for the most ardent partisan ideologues, most voters focus on narrow concerns closest to their hearts and homes.Kemp has a record of supporting social conservative issues and prioritizing the GOP base's causes and concerns. Hemoved to have Georgia beone of the first states to re-open amid the Covid-19 pandemic,signed a billthat would ban most abortions after six weeks in the state and the \"parents bill of rights,\" asserting greater parental involvement in public schools. He alsopusheda controversial \"Georgia Election Integrity Act,\" signed a bill thatallows Georgians to carry handgunsin public without a license and responded to widespread public safety concernsby promoting strong measuresto combat the rise in crime in Atlanta and other areas of the state. Whilemany of these initiativeshave beenstronglycriticizedby Democrats andoutside progressive groupsaround the country, they played very well with the Georgia Republican base.In addition, for the business-focused Republican voters in the state, Kemp is presiding over a robust state economywith an unemployment rateat 3.1% -- half a point lower than the national average -- andsigned a $1 billion income tax cutinto law last month. The state continues to beranked asone of the top states in the country to do business and a series of announcements touting new industries moving to Georgia was recently capped off by the news of amassive $5.5 billion Hyundai plantto be built outside of Savannah. This business-friendly approach led the Georgia Chamber of Commerce last fall toendorse Kemp's re-election bid.Finally, Kemp has also appealed to more socially moderate suburban Republican voters in the wake of the tragicmurder of Ahmaud Arberyin 2020 by first ordering the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to take over the inquiry into his death and laterworking to first pass and then signGeorgia's new hate crimes bill --and then repealingthe state's Civil War-era citizen's arrest law.Against Kemp's substantive conservative track record and overtures to more moderate suburban voters, Perdue has badly stumbled over a second rule in politics --\"beating an incumbent ain't easy\" -- and that is especially true if you can't offer a clear alternative. Perdue's attempts to distinguish himself quickly turned desperate,clumsilyappearing to attack the governor for a teachers' pay raise and cutting gas taxes, typically red meat for the Republican base, before having to back track. He thenattacked a new proposed Rivian plantlured to rural Georgia by Kemp.After these efforts failed, Perdue was left with parroting the former president's unsubstantiated and debunked election fraud claims and by arguing that hewould be a stronger opponent against Abrams, a claim not supported by polling or recent history, having just lost a high-profile state race in 2020 in contrast to Kemp's defeat of Abrams in 2018. As a result, by primary day Perdue's efforts to distinguish himself simply collapsed.So where does this leave Trump? In the classic 1975 movie \"The Man Who Would Be King,\" Sean Connery's character is a rogue figure who sets himself up as a God/King in a remote foreign land. When his local royal court discover, however, that he is a mere mortal, let's just say things go very badly for him and his companions. Will the former president face a similar fate from other Republican leaders after his setback in the Georgia governor's race?
