Listening to his nonsense?In the 12 years he ran Dow before its 2017 merger with DuPont, Dow generated earnings of $US36.8 billion from its plastics business alone. That's not sales, that's profit (in case Emma Alberici was confused). And over that same period, Liveris was paid $US262.3 million. One of the merger's most attractive synergies must surely have been his salary.It is therefore beyond ludicrous that Liveris, of all people, would deign to proselytise the environmental devastation plastic waste wreaks on our oceans. Next we'll have Rupert Murdoch calling for an end to paper milling.None of this is to detract from Andrew Forrest's laudable mission on marine pollution, though itself not lacking irony given the $20 billion Twiggy has made himself \"plundering natural resources\" (Liveris' words, not ours).Forrest's Minderoo Foundation is \"working with leading researchers globally to better understand the human health impacts of plastics\". Dow's only been foisting them on humans for 60 years!Liveris somehow reconciles this new ecological crusade with his quixotic mission to unlock a gas-led manufacturing boom (that will incidentally require a moratorium on democracy in at least three Australian states or the removal by referendum of their constitutional powers). That's right, he is saving the oceans while lobbying for fossil-fuel subsidies for uneconomic industries. It's like he has three heads and none of them actually talk to each other.But this is hardly Liveris' first tour de force in hypocrisy. Even while trousering more than a quarter of a billion US dollars, his aversion to paying for anything himself was legendary. He used Dow's Gulfstream jet to transport cases of Penfolds Grange to his home and office in Michigan. He flew the jet to the Bahamas, and to Queensland for Christmas and New Year, later admitting he \"never put shoes on once\".He flew it to the Superbowl where he asked to be seated nowhere near Dow's VIP clients. He used it to fly Bill Clinton to a game of golf - while Dow was paying Clinton's lobbying firm, Teneo, millions. Then he donated $US1 million of Dow's money to Donald Trump's inauguration, and the President promptly appointed Liveris an adviser.And having done all of that, Liveris warned us of \"growing opposition to a paradigm where the rich get richer\", that \"the money economy has created an elite class, a global class, call it a very, very 1 per cent class, and the middle class has atrophied\". The dissonance is simply spectacular.Banksia Securities costs scandal claims another legal careerThe costs hearing involving the Banksia Securities class action is rapidly reaching its shocking conclusion.Prominent class action litigator Mark Elliott, who died in a farming accident earlier this year, stood to profit handsomely from the lawsuit's success. Then, he and others were accused of overcharging their clients millions in legal fees.Last week, legal blue blood Norman O'Bryan - Elliott's silk of choice - fell on his sword, extraordinarily acknowledging he should be struck from the bar roll and consenting to judgment against him.Yesterday, O'Bryan's junior counsel Michael Symons took a similar path.This leaves two legal careers in tatters, less than three weeks after court-appointed contradictor Peter Jopling observed that \"the plan of Messrs Elliott, O'Bryan and Symons was to run these class action proceedings to generate maximum fees for themselves and each other\".Jopling told the court it was \"Elliott's idea\". \"Mr O'Bryan joined him in it as an equal co-venturer and Mr Symons was their willing and active recruit.\"The entire Supreme Court of Victoria hearing has been conducted on video link, one of several ways Melbourne's pandemic has made its mark on the case. O'Bryan and Symons were spared the snappers on the courthouse steps. And the evidence of one witness was delayed as he grieved the deaths of several family members from the coronavirus at St Basil's Home for the Aged.The hearing is expected to conclude next month, Justice John Dixon's decision to follow.Solly Lew did all right out of JobKeeperFive months after Solomon Lew broke down in tears to Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, distraught over having just stood down 9000 workers, Lew's Premier Investments has flagged its expectation of record profits.Sales at the company's various retailers plunged 18 per cent in the second half of the year due to the coronavirus pandemic, but it nonetheless expects to lift full-year earnings between 10.5 and 11 per cent.The company has received unspecified millions in JobKeeper wage subsidies and has refused to pay commercial rents while its stores are closed during the forced pandemic lockdowns.Lew's outpouring of emotion reportedly helped convince Frydenberg to unveil the $130 billion JobKeeper program. That wage subsidy has not only slashed Premier's costs, but the JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments have led to cashed-up Millennials spending vast sums online and in store at Premier's outlets, which include Smiggle, Just Jeans, Jay Jays, Portmans, Jacqui E and Dotti.Booming online sales mean Premier may struggle to requalify for JobKeeper beyond September 27."
