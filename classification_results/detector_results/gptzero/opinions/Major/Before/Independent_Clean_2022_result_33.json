It will take years to unpick the knotted mess they will create, which will mostly only benefit millionaire businessmen who bankroll the party.These MPs must not assume this is also what the majority of the Brexit-voting electorate want. We must pull back from the brink now and continue to deliver Brexit with a new leader, but in a rational and pragmatic way. Otherwise, many protections that we currently enjoy will mysteriously disappear in the name of \"progress\" ie allowing companies to pollute, elude prosecution, water down employee rights, degrade food quality, ignore green policies etc.Lynn BrymerKentA question of seniorityYou report that Tobias Ellwood is the most senior Toryto announcehe has handed in a letter to the 1922 Committee. Jacob Rees-Mogg would no doubt disagree with me on this, but as the leader of the Scottish Conservatives surely that title should go to Douglas Ross?Paul KellyBuckinghamshireUkraineMy memory ofUkrainesome 10 years ago was of a nation split linguistically and theologically, with split geopolitical leanings. Yet there was one notion held in common by most Ukrainians: they wanted to live in an independent and united Ukraine.In this may be the seed of a solution to the current stand-off. If a plebiscite were to be held in Ukrainian administrative areas (a complicated matter in itself), most of Ukraine would choose not to be Russian. The few districts who would secede would probably allow consolidation of the previous Crimean takeover, offering a victory of sorts to the Russian government.It should be appreciated from the outset that this is not a particularly desirable solution. It will have been precipitated by aggression and will no doubt involve a fair amount of intimidation and subterfuge.Cole DavisNorwichRead MoreEditorial: Ukraine values - and deserves - the support of the westUkraine's president is the voice of reason in stand-off with Russia | Mary DejevskyEditorial: The crisis in Ukraine deserves the PM's attention but it will not save himGerman caution over Russia will put it on the right side of history | Mary DejevskyRussia's last invasion of Ukraine offers clues about what Putin's thinking nowOpinion: Why the answer isn't Ukraine 'fighting its own wars' | Natalia Antonova"
