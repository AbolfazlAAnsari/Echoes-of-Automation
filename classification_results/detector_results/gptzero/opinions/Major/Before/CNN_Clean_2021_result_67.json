The systems of no-excuse absentee balloting for a lengthy period before Election Day, online voter registration and Election Day registration are just some of the ways the state has historically made it easier for voters to make their voices heard. However, in Minnesota, Secretary Steve Simon is still focused on expanding ballot access for all eligible voters -- particularly for the 20% of them who didn't cast a ballot in 2020. The mission is to expand support for new ways to get voters involved and informed -- and to tell truth in the face of lies designed to create fear and doubt about election results.Although these reforms are common sense next steps to ensuring all Americans can exercise their right to vote, some factions of state lawmakers are using lies and myths about the 2020 election as a pretext to roll back voting rights. In Michigan, lawmakers launched a series of legislative hearings to rehash the false claims about the 2020 elections. In Minnesota, there is a push by lawmakers to add a voter ID requirement in the state, despite Minnesotans rejecting a similar measure in 2012 when it appeared on the ballot as a constitutional amendment. And, in Arizona, a lawmaker introduced legislation that would give the state legislature the power to revoke the certification of presidential electors chosen by Arizona voters.In short, with the introduction of more than 100 bills including harsh voter ID laws and other voting restrictions already in the works, the voter suppression effort is well underway.Many of the legislators who are continuing to push false claims about the 2020 presidential election are the same ones pushing regressive election laws in the name of \"restoring public faith in our elections.\" But the only way for public officials to restore Americans' faith in our elections is to tell them the truth. We need a willingness to put politics aside and unify around the idea at the very heart of who we are as Americans: our free and fair elections.If we can achieve that mission -- and we believe we can and we will -- then we will emerge from one of the darkest chapters in American history with a shared commitment to a brighter, stronger future for every voter.TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.
