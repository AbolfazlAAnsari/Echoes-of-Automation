Surely there is only a limited number of people needed to cut ribbons without injuring themselves or anyone else.I would be happy to take over the ribbon cutting duties for a large salary which would probably save the royal purse quite a lot. I am also moderately boring and unlikely to be photographed in the wrong places at the wrong time.Dennis FitzgeraldMelbourne, AustraliaVaccinations for allWhere's the global vaccination \"Marshall Plan\"? Having a plan to fully vaccinate everyone, everywhere in the world against Covid as quickly as humanly possible, and putting that plan into action, should be everyone's new year's resolution.It's been said before, by those experts some don't seem to want to listen to, but the longer it goes on that there are un-and under-vaccinated populations in the world, the greater the risk that the virus mutates into a variant that actually has the ability to evade vaccines.Therefore, even those vaccinated and boosted populations remain at risk. Also, denying vaccination to populations is itself unethical. The longer we leave it, the less effective the older vaccines that we are still rolling out will be.Just one year of billionaires, governments and charitable donations funding a global \"vaccination of everyone, for everyone\", instead of space tourism or arms races, might spare us all another year of chaos.Ian HendersonNorwichWhy are we dragging our feet over climate change?I'm at a loss to understand why Priti Patel fails to see the blindingly obvious solution to her problem with eco-protesters. Why not just do what they're asking?It's increasingly urgent to act on all fronts to save us all from climate change. Perhaps she hasn't noticed that it didn't go away after Cop26. It won't go away until it's put on a war footing - something the UK government attempted with some success in the fight against Covid-19.They managed to reduce the number of deaths from the virus. Many millions will die if climate change isn't halted, so let's see the same determination and urgency as with the pandemic.To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter byclicking hereWe know what needs doing, why aren't we getting on with it? Is it because we don't want to upset those members of the public who have suffered \"misery\" as a result of the protests? If so, Ms Patel clearly hasn't understood the levels of misery lying ahead while she continues to dream up more and more draconian laws restricting our freedoms.Lynda NewberyBristolOpen the classroom windowsMary Bousted of the National Education Union isright to point outthat 7,000 air-filtering units for classrooms is \"completely inadequate\" for more than 300,000 classrooms. But as a teacher, I'm not waiting for my air-filtering unit.I decided early on to have my windows fully open and teach wearing a jumper in the winter. I've had very few complaints from students!Kartar UppalSutton ColdfieldRead MoreOpinion: What refugees need most this winter is kindnessLetters: Tony Blair's knighthood is an insultLetters: The UK is set to face the full consequences of BrexitLetters: Tony Blair's knighthood is an insultLetters: The UK is set to face the full consequences of BrexitLetters: NHS staff do not deserve the scenes by anti-vaxxers in Milton Keynes"
