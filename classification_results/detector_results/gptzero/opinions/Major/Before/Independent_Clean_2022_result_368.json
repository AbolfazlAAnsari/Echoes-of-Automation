The Tories implemented austerity in 2008 to deal with the financial crisis in the banking sector – we paid dearly for the greed of people in this sector. In 2013, David Cameron made austerity the norm, leaving poor people poorer. It was a political decision to bring misery to people least able to cope.So now when external forces (plus Brexit) create the situation we are currently dealing with, it’s everyone else’s fault except the Tory government. No mention of the assistance given to the people in Europe by their governments who capped energy costs while British suppliers were falling over themselves to hike prices as high as they could.People need to be reminded of the back tory of why we are being hit so hard now – Tory policies. And it’s not just pay, it’s the terms and conditions that are being eroded. The rail workers and postal staff aren’t being greedy, nor are they refusing to embrace improved technological advances. The most expensive overhead in any business are the staff. In the case of privatised utilities, there is the added imperative to make as much money as possible. The only way management can do this is by making staff work longer for less money.Those who feel therail workers are not deservingand are only causing misery need to look at the trains they travel in, the efficiency of the network and the cost of being transported like cattle. They’re used to these standards and now complain when they’re not available. Do they want to add to this by full automation of ticketing and no guards on the platform or on late night trains?It makes me mad when theBBCgives voice to Tories who blame the current state of the country on working people who have to use food banks to live. David Cameron said the best way out of poverty was through work. Around 40 per cent of working people rely on in-work benefits and many large employers provide discounted food for staff who are short of money towards the end of the month.The people who need to understand why the country are in such a mess are those who are least likely to watch a balanced programme on the subject and who are most likely to vote for the Tories, believing their masters will look after them.Susan HunterAddress suppliedEntrepreneurial spiritTwo in three voterswould back NHS nurses taking more strike action to improve their pay and conditions. Yet the government looks unlikely to agree to an improved offer, despite the pay of nurses and other public sector workers having fallen behind those employed in the private sector.With this in mind, has the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) considered setting up their own nursing agency business, enrolling its members and then hiring them back to the NHS at higher rates of pay? The government supposedly supports entrepreneurship – so can hardly object!Roger HindsSurreyBan hunting with houndsThe commitment from Labour tostrengthen the Hunting Actis a very welcome Christmas present for everyone who opposes this dreadfully cruel activity.But politicians must understand that, after 18 years of total defiance from hunters since the ban came into force, there is no room left for trust or giving the benefit of the doubt. There must be a total ban on hunting with hounds, with provision only for bona fide, long established drag hunts. Banning “trail hunting” will not be enough, and would in fact be banning something that does not exist – you can’t ban smoke and mirrors, which are the only substances involved.Penny LittleGreat Haseley"
