            "inputText": "\"Andrew Cuomo did this to himself,\" a reader writes. Also: Climate change; democracy in Hungary; Israel&#39;s universities; separating work from home.To the Editor:Re “Cuomo to Resign Amid Sexual Harassment Scandal” (nytimes.com, Aug. 10):Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigns!Don’t rejoice! There’s no rejoicing here! This is very sad and not good for New York State or the Democratic Party. This is yet another example of a man in power not thinking with the head on his shoulders.Was Mr. Cuomo a great governor? That’s a matter of opinion. I believe he was. I believe he was good for New York. Should he have done what he’s accused of doing? Absolutely not! Did he need to resign? Absolutely! This was too much of a distraction at a time when we can least afford it.However, what has always irked me in these scenarios, of which there have been so many, is the discrepancy in how they are handled by the two parties.The Democratic Party is always quick to judge its members and demand accountability, often forcing resignation (e.g., Senator Al Franken). And what has the Republican Party done over similar and worse allegations, as in the case of Donald Trump? Nothing! Its members still support him, his lies, his predatory actions (sexual and otherwise), his attempts to overthrow the government. And they do so without apology.We all need to decide what kind of country we would rather live in. Hopefully we will decide we want to live in a country of integrity and truth, where those in power are held accountable for their actions, not just by the people but by their parties.Dinah MarkHuntington Station, N.Y.To the Editor:There is a simple way to drastically reduce the occurrence of situations like this. We need more women in positions of power at every level of government, business and the nonprofit sector.Period.Bruce WeinsteinNew YorkThe writer is the author of “The Good Ones: Ten Crucial Qualities of High-Character Employees.”To the Editor:How can the same man be politically savvy enough to get elected governor of New York three times, and so politically stupid to end his own career by his own actions? Andrew Cuomo did this to himself; nobody came gunning for him.Ralph AverillNew Preston, Conn.Climate Change: ‘Let’s Stop Dawdling and Start Moving!’To the Editor:Two Aug. 9 news articles illuminate our current state of affairs. “Senate Is Working the ‘Old-Fashioned Way’: Slowly”describes the glacial pace of enacting legislation in the upper chamber of Congress. “A Hotter Future Is Now Inevitable, a U.N. Report Says” makes clear that legislation mandating significant reductions in fossil-fuel emissions is urgently needed if we are to forestall a climate catastrophe.Our way of life (and for many species, life itself) rests upon whether or not a form of government devised in the 18th century can meet a present-day existential crisis.Roger Breese DayDuluth, Minn.To the Editor:The world has dawdled over major efforts to reduce carbon emissions, and as you say the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report indicates, “there is still a short window to prevent the most harrowing future.”This should be a clarion call to us and to all nations to move ahead quickly. Fossil fuel companies have been polluting our air and pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere without stint, even though they’ve known it’s dangerous for the planet. We should immediately pass one or more of the bills waiting in Congress to put a price on carbon emissions, the most effective and efficient way to curb them.I want my children and grandchildren to have a livable planet, not a harrowing future! Let’s stop dawdling and get moving!Maggie Wineburgh-FreedLos AngelesTo the Editor:After years of scientific reports about the perils of our profligate energy consumption, the most recent conclusion is that we have reached that tipping point where severe impacts are now inevitable. This is a mistake you make only once; there is no going back. Some hope of mitigating the worst outcome, global catastrophe, may still be possible.If the inability of the world to come together around the immediate threat of the Covid-19 pandemic is any example of how the future will unfold around the threats of global climate change, I am afraid our chances are slim to none. Having made a choice to remain childless, I always wondered if I would come to regret my decision. Sadly, I no longer wonder.Helen OgdenPacific Grove, Calif.Losing Democracy in HungaryTo the Editor:Re “Hungary Inspires Fear and Fascination,” by Ross Douthat (column, Aug. 8):The fear of Prime Minister Viktor Orban among Hungarian liberals is about much more than corruption or losing your job. It’s about losing democracy.Mr. Orban is changing the legal system to be under his control. He is trying to control the mass media. And he is using his power to make political opposition increasingly difficult. Mr. Douthat writes that “Viktor Orban might lose the next election.” My fear is that that may no longer be possible.I grew up in Europe, in the shadow of fascism and Communism, and to see American conservatives applaud Viktor Orban makes me terrified. His government is not only nationalist, it’s also authoritarian — and dangerous.Ulf LandoSanta Monica, Calif.Israel’s Universities Can Create a ‘Safe Space’ for Jews and ArabsTo the Editor:Re“Riots Shatter Illusion of Coexistence in Israel”(front page, Aug. 2):Despite the normalization agreements Israel signed with four Arab states last year, much progress remains to be made on Jewish-Arab relations within Israel. A powerful paradigm in that regard exists on college campuses, which are well positioned to cultivate an environment where coexistence is not only an aspiration but also a way of life.Natural barriers exist, namely students’ inclination to avoid “the other.” But by creating more programs that unite diverse populations, higher education institutions can lead the way in crafting a different narrative.The potential is underscored in the fact that over the past decade the number of Arab students in Israeli academia has doubled. At the University of Haifa, where Arabs make up 32 percent of the student body, we have programs specifically designed to foster multicultural encounters among students to create leadership groups within the university and the local community.In Israel, colleges and universities can offer a safe space for Jews and Arabs to discuss difficult issues. If institutions capitalize on that opportunity, coexistence can move closer to a reality, not just an “illusion.”Ron RobinHaifa, IsraelThe writer is president of the University of Haifa.‘Work Is Work. Home Is Home.”To the Editor:Re “Working From Home Doesn’t Totally Work,” by John Zavitsanos (Opinion guest essay, July 27):To say that I have been skeptical of the rhetoric surrounding the productivity of at-home work while I have maintained a business through the entire pandemic without closing a single day is putting it lightly. All the people I know who have been forced to work remotely went from saying they had never been more productive, to desiring more time at work for personal focus, to lamenting the distractions at home.The classic models of work need examining and re-evaluating, but not reinventing because of a temporary (although long-lived) pandemic. Work is work. Home is home. Combining those worlds has consequences, positive and negative. For worker and employer.I hope that both owners and employees can learn from this experience to communicate better about our needs and wants (on both sides) and produce a stronger and more productive work-life balance — together.Charlie ReddSomerville, Mass.The writer is the owner of Dragon Pizza.PHOTO: Gov.
