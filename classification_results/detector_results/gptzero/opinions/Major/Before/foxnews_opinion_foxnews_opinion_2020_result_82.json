Unlike past periods of urban upheaval, this one has an unusual pattern — it’s overtly political.Cities with the largest share of votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 are those seeing the most violence. This, as leftwing mayors sympathetic to the violent demonstrators have hamstrung their police while supporting the “defunding” of law enforcement. It’s a volatile mix that threatens to spiral out of control, leading many unnerved liberals to discover their Second Amendment rights — and that it’s harder to buy a handgun and ammo than they thought.Fortunately for Rogan and others who make their living with their ideas, words and images, high speed internet facilitates productivity almost anywhere.And for others who lean towards hands-on work, Elon Musk’s Tesla announced a major expansion into Texas last week that will employ at least 5,000 workers. Tesla CEO Musk had often expressed his frustration with California elected officials’ anti-business attitudes.All of this will likely continue and deepen the trend of Californians moving out of the Democrat-controlled state, with the U.S. Census reporting that nearly 700,000 Californians left for other states in 2018, with the largest share of those, 86,000, moving to Texas (while 501,000 people moved into California from other states).Thankfully for continuation of those Texas policies that result in “more freedom,”multiple pollssuggest that most of these new Texans by choice lean conservative.BY CHUCK DEVORE   "
