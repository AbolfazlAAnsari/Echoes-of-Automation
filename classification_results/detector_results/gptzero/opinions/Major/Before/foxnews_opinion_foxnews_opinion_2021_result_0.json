I honestly believed that, once the district saw the letter, it would recognize its error and the issue would be quickly resolved.But that’s not what happened; instead, the district doubled down and changed the rules. It doesn’t take a football coach to tell you that you cannot change the rules midgame.With First Liberty’s help, I filed a lawsuit against Bremerton School District. We knew it would not be easy.My casestarted in the district court, then went to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court.Although the Supreme Court decided not to hear my case at the time, in a relatively rare move, four of the Court’s justices—Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh—issued astatementexplaining that my case was not ready to be heard because important factual questions remained unresolved.  They then set out a game plan for how the case should be reviewed.I am not a lawyer, but to me it felt like the Court gave us a new set of downs.Five years is a long time to be in court, and the question I am getting asked is, \"Why keep fighting this?  Why not move on?\"My answer is simple: quitting would violate everything I tried to teach my players.That isn’t to say this has been an easy road.  There are days when I want to give up and move on with my life.  There are days when I don’t think I can keep fighting this fight.  But that’s when I remember the hundreds of times I told my players not quit no matter the challenge!I also think of the thousands of other public school coaches and teachers whose inalienable right to freely exercise their faith in public is at risk if the court decisions against me are allowed to stand.I also remember the commitment I made to God, so with the help of my attorneys, I fight on.And I’ll keep fighting, all the way back to the Supreme Court if necessary. In time, I’m confident I will be able to return to the field, and that the First Amendment rights of coaches and teachers will be restored.Until then, let’s play ball.Joe Kennedy is a former U.S. Marine. He coached high school football in Bremerton, Washington."
