The kids did run right past him – so fast, in fact, the eggs in their basket popped out, and Tyler was there to pick them up, leaving him with more than everyone else.Lisa said the Lord spoke to her: \"You give this little boy to me and his basket will be full of blessings – so many they won't fit.”Racism is caused by one primary thing – sin.Retired NFL tight end Benjamin Watson says the root of ongoing racial tension is spiritual in nature.“You need to honestly go before God and then get a real inventory of your heart. Is your heart hard? Has it been hardened by politics? Has it been hardened by your family history?”Our job is not to solve every problem – but to bring clarity to the problems and bring peace to the chaos.For the last one, I return to Bible teacher Ray Vander Laan.“Jesus' death transforms who I am so that I now become someone who brings shalom to the chaos in the world around me,” he told me.Don’t try to carry the weight of the whole world on your shoulders.I’m so grateful for these helpful insights. Practical wisdom in this life is available to us if we humble ourselves and reach out to the wealth and insight of those around us.FROM JIM DALY   "
