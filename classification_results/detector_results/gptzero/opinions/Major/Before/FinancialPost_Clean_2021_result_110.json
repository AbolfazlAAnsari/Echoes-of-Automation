And the feds threw in an immediate increase of $1 per carton for good measure!Fast forward to the present. The indexed federal increase for 2021 was implemented as planned on April 1 - which made the additional $4 per carton increase just three weeks later on budget day that much more of a surprise. While sellers of contraband were no doubt well pleased, provincial finance officials were far less likely to be enthusiastic as all provinces except British Columbia had already tabled their 2021 budgets. When B.C. tabled its budget two days after Ottawa, it added a whopping $6 per carton increase of its own.For those who don't believe tobacco smuggling is a serious problem, last November the Canada Revenue Agency released a study estimating the loss in federal excise duty revenue from illegal cigarettes - the so-called \"tax gap\" - at about $483 million in 2014. Lost provincial tax revenues would more than double that estimate. And the gap has likely widened in the seven years since.Terence Corcoran: From beer to billionaires, massive tax grabs are here(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-from-beer-to-billionaires-massive-tax-grabs-are-here)Opinion: Health Canada's nicotine caps will kill people(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-health-canadas-nicotine-caps-will-kill-people)Jack M.

If large tax increases follow in other provinces, tobacco tax revenues will no doubt plummet below forecast levels. Finance estimated this increase will raise $2.135 billion in additional revenue over the next five years. A Parliamentary Budget Office review lowered this to $2.04 billion. But both assume no tax policy response from the provinces. More seriously, more smokers will switch to readily available and far cheaper contraband products, which will be bad for the health side of policy, especially for young people since illegal sellers do not ask for proof-of-age ID.Ironically, Budget 2021 also announced the government's intention to introduce a new taxation framework for the imposition of excise duty on vaping products in 2022, saying it \"will also work with any provinces and territories that may be interested in a federally coordinated approach to taxing these products.\"I would love to be a fly on the wall during those discussions.Fred O'Riordan is national leader for tax policy at EY and a former director-general for excise duties and taxes at the Canada Revenue Agency. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
