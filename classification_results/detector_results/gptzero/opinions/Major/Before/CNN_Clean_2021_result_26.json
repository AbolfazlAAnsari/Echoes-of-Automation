Both the House and the Senate will soon consider a bill that would adopt numerous democracy reforms, such as requiring states to offer same-day voter registration, 15 days of early voting, and no-excuse vote-by-mail, among other significant structural changes to our election laws. A Pew poll in 2018 found that two thirds of Americans agree that \"everything possible should be done to make it easy for every citizen to vote.\"State-level attacks on the right to vote call for a bipartisan commitment to democracy, which means full participation in our elections. We should strive for high turnout and determine our leaders based on who receives the most votes, not which party's voters have the easiest path to the ballot box. We must eliminate gerrymandering and manipulation of Electoral College rules that entrench minority control.States should focus on expanding access to the ballot, not putting up unnecessary restrictions in the name of phantom voter fraud. And if they won't, then Congress should pass robust democracy reform measures so that every American can realize the ideals of a democratic republic that is actually responsive to the will of the voters.TM & © 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.
