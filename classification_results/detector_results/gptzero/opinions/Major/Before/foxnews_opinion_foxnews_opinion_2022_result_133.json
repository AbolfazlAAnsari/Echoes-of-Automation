Josh Hawley and Don, Jr., proved irresistible to the former president who looks more and more likely to fire up his phone and his newly retooled jet to torture the swamp with a retaliatory run for a final term.VANCE CALLS FOR GOP UNITY AFTER MAJOR COMEBACK IN OHIO SENATE PRIMARYBut the all too obvious story here is the impact of Trump on primaries and the eventual success of his strategy in the midterms. However, what is less understood or discussed is how quickly the GOP, which never changes, has.This could be the most enduring legacy of the Trump years. It is not so much that he drained the swamp, he just exposed it.  It could also be argued that Trump finished the job of breaking down Washington that Reagan started 50 years ago.For the political class of Washington the Trump era was a bad dream that they strongly believe is forever in the rearview mirror.They believe Biden is a return to normalcy and that the next presidential contest will include a mannerly Republican they can abide because the party platform will go back to being bait only used to deceptively snare enough votes without any intention of it guiding action (echoes of McCain and Romney with a side of Liz Cheney.)Wiser eyes can see that the GOP has been transformed.  Across the country Trump and his allies are the standard, and even those who are independent of America First understand that America is in a dire situation that is not of Trump’s making but due to the radical lurch to the left by the Democrats, educational institutions, culture creators and corporate elitists being poorly advised by the Zuckerbucks bunglers at the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable.The GOP was established by moral revolutionaries who wished to upend the economic status quo by emancipating slaves. The Republican Party was willing to champion both a moral and a sound economic cause.Today’s GOP is about to rediscover its founding purpose as dozens of independent candidates are on the road to victory paved by a dedication to fulfil past Republican promises  all financed by thousands of smaller donors and a vast new generation of independent-minded conservative activists.Soon JD Vance will be joined by other independent, wealthy and or famous GOP stalwarts from Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia and other races that will become competitive as we get close to November.Many predicted that the lack of movement in the Senate would discourage top tier candidates from running, but instead the Senate’s paralysis has motivated Republican candidates to run in an effort to make real change and give America a lifeline.But JD Vance deserves praise for being the improbable frontrunner in the important state of Ohio. May his victory in the fall be the wake up call to both the left on just how unpopular they are and to the standard operating procedures of the establishment GOP which has squandered too many chances to make the fight.Congrats to our Hillbilly Senator, and to the many allies who will be joining him.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MATT SCHLAPPMatt Schlapp is chairman ofThe American Conservative Union, co-founder ofCove Strategies, and former White House Political Director to President George W.
