            "inputText": "Canada has not followed(https://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-why-our-toothless-competition-bureau-cant-go-after-big-tech) the United States, the European Union or the United Kingdom in taking on the dominance of the tech giants through its competition watchdog. While we are limited by our outdated Competition Act, there are other factors that hinder Canada's ability to take action against monopolistic business practices.Some have suggested that the Competition Bureau takes fewer cases against the digital giants because it lacks the jurisdictional authority to do so. But jurisdictional issues cannot totally explain the bureau's lack of action. After all, the Competition Bureau has quite a bit of latitude to investigate and legally challenge mergers, abuses of dominance and other anti-competitive behaviours of businesses that are not headquartered in Canada.For example, in its 2016 investigation of Google, the bureau examined much of the same conduct as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) did in its investigations in 2012 and 2013, just in the Canadian context. Why not do the same with Facebook or Apple?Another potential reason why the Competition Bureau doesn't take as many actions against FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) firms is that Canadians often directly benefit from the enforcement action taken by American and European authorities.When the U.S. or EU takes action against these multinational firms, it often results in changes to how the firms operate. To date, Canada has been able to free ride on these benefits without going through the trouble of conducting its own investigations or initiating legal action.For example, the 2013 FTC investigation into Google's business practices pertaining to patents acquired through its short-lived acquisition of Motorola has likely impacted Canadian consumers of electronic devices that rely on Motorola's intellectual property. In 2013, Google agreed to(https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/07/ftc-finalizes-settlement-google-motorola-mobility-case) change its business practices to make its patents accessible to manufacturers of laptops, smart phones and other electronic devices on \"fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.\"Canadian consumers may also benefit from the FTC's recent agreement with Google(https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2484) pertaining to its acquisition of Fitbit, in which the tech giant agreed to implement a \"data silo\" to prevent Fitbit health data and Google advertising data from being linked together.Even in instances where the Competition Bureau does take cases against the major tech firms, it significantly benefits from being a second-mover. The bureau can leverage remedies mandated by U.S. and EU authorities, in order to strike its own agreements with the affected companies.By being a second (or third) mover, the Competition Bureau can see if enforcement action plays out favourably in other countries before taking action itself. If the bureau commonly uses this second-mover strategy, as the data suggests it does, this may explain why it is less proactive than its U.S. and EU counterparts.Canada's 2016 investigation into Google(https://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/04066.html) illustrates this point. During its investigation, the Competition Bureau found that Google's terms and conditions related to its AdWords API raised competition issues, similar to what the FTC found in its 2013 investigation.As a result of the FTC investigation, Google made changes to its agreement, but the changes \"did not specifically govern the manner in which it does business in Canada,\" and also did not apply to both the English and French versions of the agreement. Yet in 2016, Google agreed to make these Canada-specific changes to the Adwords API terms and conditions, so that they aligned with the changes negotiated by the FTC.The bureau's action against Apple in relation to its conspiracy with publishers to fix the price of ebooks also followed in the footsteps of the FTC, and illustrated the Competition Bureau's pattern of being a second-mover on antitrust cases. The FTC filed its suit against Apple and the publishers in April 2012, and the case was litigated until 2016. In Canada, the Competition Bureau launched its investigation(https://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/03658.html) in November 2012, months after the FTC filed its suit, and reached a settlement with Apple in 2017.If Canada is deliberately a second-mover, perhaps it is waiting on the results of the suits filed last year against Facebook and Google by the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), before it launches its own investigations.The Competition Bureau may, in fact, have little choice but to wait patiently because it has substantially less ability to collect the evidence it needs to challenge Facebook and Google. Specifically, it lacks the ability to undertake market studies with firms' own data, which prevents it from flagging anti-competitive behaviour in the sector. However, if the FTC and DOJ win their cases, the Competition Bureau may be able to use the evidence from those cases to launch its own investigations.Yet it is Europe that has really led the way on competition policy, as it not only has taken more action against these firms, it also tends to investigate different issues than authorities in North America. In 2020, for example, the EU opened investigations into Apple's App Store(https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1073) and Apple Pa(https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1075)y. Based on the information we have, neither Canadian nor U.S. authorities have investigated potential anti-competitive conduct on the part of these services.Likewise, in 2020, the European Commission launched investigations into Amazon's use of third-party seller data(https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2077) and its logistics and delivery service to enhance its own retail business. In 2015, the commission also struck an agreement(https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_17_1223) with Amazon requiring it to remove its \"most-favoured-nation\" clauses from ebook distribution agreements, which led to higher prices. Canadian and U.S. authorities have never undertaken public investigations into these matters.The European Commission has also been proactive against Google. In 2017 and 2019, it fined the company 2.42-billion and 1.49-billion euros, respectively, for abusing its dominant position with respect to its Google Shopping and AdSense services. Canadian and U.S. authorities did not follow suit. In fact, in its 2013 investigation, the FTC found that there were no competition issues with Google's use of Google Shopping, contrary to the EU finding five years later.The European Commission also put restrictions on Google's acquisition of Fitbit in an effort to control the tech giant's use of health data to better target advertising. The investigation is still being reviewed(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/google-closes-fitbit-deal-amid-ongoing-u-s-doj-review) by the DOJ, and there is no sign that the Competition Bureau will review the deal.Part of the EU's proactiveness may be due to the fact that most of the big technology firms are based in the U.S., which makes it easier, politically, for European authorities to antagonize them.The EU could fine Amazon a maximum of $37 billion (around 10 per cent of its annual global sales) under formal antitrust charges(https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/u-s-justice-dept-puts-big-tech-under-the-antitrust-microscope-1.4521011?cache=yes%3Fclipid%3D104056%3FclipId%3D263414) that were recently brought against it for abusing its dominance in online shopping. If Canada were to fine the company for the same behaviour, the maximum penalty would be $10 million for the first offence and $15 million for any subsequent order on the same issue. That's just 0.04 per cent of the EU's levy.Canada's competition policy toolkit lacks the capacity of its international peers. Even our commissioner of competition, Matthew Boswell, has acknowledged that(https://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/04492.html), \"The maximum penalties for anti-competitive behaviour ... lack the teeth necessary to deter anti-competitive behaviour.\"We need to do more than be a free rider and second-mover when it comes to antitrust interventions that challenge the practices of the world's largest technology firms. Dealing with multinational monopolies demands a rational and coherent approach to competition policy.Recent research by legal scholars at Columbia University and the University of Chicago found that countries around the world are increasingly adopting the European approach to competition policy. As this convergence continues, Canada sticks out like a sore thumb. Our outdated approach is far out of step with our international peers and needs to be changed in order to address 21st-century competition issues.National PostVass Bednar is the executive director of McMaster University's master of public policy in digital society program.
