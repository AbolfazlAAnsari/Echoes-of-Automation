There are parallels but the situation now is far more serious than 1972 in that growth was already a robust 4.3 per cent, inflation half the current headline rate and debt to GDP significantly lower.In 1972 there was still a well-functioning welfare state and an NHS fully supported by both major parties, termed “Butskellism” with child poverty after housing costs about half today’s level and income inequality much lower largely due to Family Income Supplement. A One Nation Tory tradition still prevailed but was soon to be shattered by the Thatcher revolution. This latest free-market gamble carried risks that could be seen from outer space. Unfortunately for the country these were dismissed by the most economically illiterate or ideologically rigid Tory prime minister and her chancellor a narrow and self-serving membership could foist upon the country.Paul DolanCheshire"
