They did not pay attention and well over 100,000 people have died as a result.The proof that without lockdown the transmission rate is exponential, and with stringent lockdowns it can be virtually nil, has been available since mid-February.It has also been known since February that the vulnerable are the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, yet no government has acted to eliminate the possibility of the virus getting to vulnerable people through the care system.Lockdowns will be eased, the transmission rate will go up and vulnerable people will die unnecessarily because no one is taking responsibility for the vulnerable.Jon Hawksley​                                          FrancePolicing by consentIt is generally recognised that we are a nation that is policed by consent. In these times anything that can lead to a breakdown of that consent between the public and the police forces will only cause significant resentment and a breakdown in the trust that currently exists between those policing and the policed. So the latest guidelines from the CPS, enthusiastically and predictably adopted by the NPCC and College of Policing, are a recipe for disaster.For example, the government has specifically referenced B&Q as a store that provides essential services to people during the period of lockdown and therefore allowed to remain open. As a result, people have been flocking to use the company's Click & Collect service, buying DIY goods online in record numbers as the stores are physically closed to the general public.How are the police meant to determine whether someone's collection from a car park outside a store is for essential maintenance and upkeep (allowed) and not renovation and improvements (not allowed)? Are the police going to have to follow each customer who calls at a B&Q store back home to ensure that the goods are for \"essential maintenance\"? Or will they try to head the purchase off at the store, setting up roadblocks at access points to quiz customers arriving to pick up material on the reasons for the purchase? How is your average constable going to discriminate between maintenance and renovation?The guidance from the CPS is at odds with state support - who is right? By trying to micromanage via specific examples, the CPS has, wittingly or unwittingly, introduced yet more potential flashpoints in these fractious times. Where is the common sense in all of this? Why are the police being forced into an impossible position where one constable's essential maintenance is another's renovation?Consent is a precious commodity. These \"clarifications\" are a prodigious waste of this asset.Robin J Bulow​                                          Clacton-on-SeaToday Sadiq Khanannouncedadditional protections for bus drivers and passengers.Remember the original London Transport Routemasters (and previously all the RT series)? Separate self-contained cab for the driver, no possibility of any contact with infected passengers. Such a shame most of them went for scrap.James Mason                                          Address not supplied"
