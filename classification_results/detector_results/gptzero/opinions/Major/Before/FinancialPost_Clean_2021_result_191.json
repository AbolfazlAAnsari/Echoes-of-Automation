            "inputText": "Though disheartening, the emerging consensus that the COVID vaccines offer declining immunity is hardly surprising. Some vaccines, such as those for polio, do offer long-term immunity; in contrast, influenza shots have become an annual ritual in many households. The possibility that COVID vaccines would require an annual booster has always been on the table. With a fourth COVID wave crashing on the borders of most provinces, the urgency of offering boosters appears to be growing.The consensus(https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/how-long-will-coronavirus-vaccine-last) appears to be that five months after the second shot, the two mRNA vaccines, Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna, offer immunity of about 70 per cent effectiveness against the Alpha variant, down from 95 per cent shortly after the second shot. Against the Delta variant immunity falls to around 60 per cent, still a high level compared to what is achieved by the average annual flu shot.Pfizer recently reported that a third booster(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html) renews immunity and lowers the chance of severe illness in people over age 60 by a factor of 20 (i.e., by an impressive 2,000 per cent). In response, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which rules on the safety of vaccines, authorized booster shots for people over 65 or those at high risk from severe COVID. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which shapes policy, initially encouraged governments to offer a booster to those over 65 and those over 50 with underlying health conditions. Director Rochelle Walensky caused a stir recently when she added those aged 18 - 49 in high-risk work/living settings to the group encouraged to get a booster. It is all quite confusing(https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/09/cdc-director-boosters/620222/).One objection to a third shot for citizens of the developed world is that almost everyone outside it has yet to receive even a first injection. Quite apart from the obvious unfairness of such glaringly unequal access, most epidemiologists stress that until the virus dissipates everywhere, there won't be truly normal life anywhere.According to the latest polling(https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/half-of-canadians-support-employers-mandating-covid-19-booster-shots-poll-finds-1.5591681), the general public is keen on boosters, even to the point of wanting a mandate of three shots. I for one do not want to wait as we repeat the same chaotic rollout of the first two shots, with political leaders each dancing to the beat of their own drum, so that booster-shot policy becomes a patchwork across provinces.How might we solve this problem? What if the third shot required a payment of, say, $75?Now, everyone, take a Valium. Let's think this through.First point: it is quite common for vaccines to carry a charge when the benefits accrue solely to the person being jabbed. A shingles shot typically costs $200. Though painful and potentially dangerous, shingles is not a communicable disease so there are no public health benefits from vaccinating everyone. The benefits of a COVID booster likely accrue mainly to the person getting the jab.Second point: the Pfizer shot costs about $19. It's true that both Pfizer and Moderna want to charge more than they currently do and may increase prices. But, at the current rate, $75 will buy four shots. What if third-world countries received three of those four shots? Applying the difference between $75 and the $19 cost of the shot to purchases of vaccines for poor countries could start to address the stark inequality of current vaccine distribution. Pfizer and the U.S. government have already committed to distributing shots to the third world, but the West still lags China, which is distributing millions of doses of its own vaccine, though it is less effective than the West's. And if the government were to offer a two-for-one deal, matching each private purchase, big purchasing leverage would be added to the single shot I bought for myself.Third point: this plan puts citizens in the driver's seat. Pharmacies would simply respond to consumer demand for a booster, while remitting the surplus revenue to whatever agency would be sending vaccines to poor countries. We could rely less on governments to organize vaccine clinics.Every ointment has flies. What are the flaws in charging for boosters?Some Canadians may have trouble coming up with the $75. Low-income seniors arguably should be first in line for a booster yet many may have difficulty finding the money. So low-income individuals should be made exempt. In effect, one of the three extra shots purchased could be reallocated to older Canadians receiving social assistance and/or old age security.Opinion: Canada should negotiate a fairer share of drug R&;D costs(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-canada-should-negotiate-a-fairer-share-of-drug-rd-costs)Jack Mintz: Pandemic mistrust may eventually improve health care(https://financialpost.com/opinion/jack-mintz-pandemic-mistrust-may-eventually-improve-health-care)Terence Corcoran: From vaccine passports to personal carbon passports: Get ready for CLIMATE-21 fossil fuel virus lockdowns(https://financialpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-get-ready-for-climate-21-fossil-fuels-virus-lockdowns)Opinion: How COVID-19 could improve health care(https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-how-covid-19-could-improve-health-care)The plan would also suffer if Big Pharma decided to raise prices(https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2021/08/01/pfizer-and-moderna-raise-prices-of-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccines-for-european-union/?sh=16a6e8de61e6). In view of the billions of dollars of subsidies and contract guarantees the industry received as part of Operation Warp Speed(https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-319), many people would see any attempt to raise prices as an unconscionable money grab. But if the U.S. Europe, and other developed countries implemented a booster charge, they could exert additional bargaining power on the companies beyond what their existing purchases have given them. Ultimately, as it usually is, competition would be the best remedy: new vaccines, especially ones compatible with the existing shots, would keep vaccine prices down.Charging for a COVID booster, especially if it protected low-income Canadians and financed the vaccination of people in developing countries, might be quite popular and so help move us closer to a world back to normal.Gregory Mason is associate professor of economics at the University of Manitoba. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.
